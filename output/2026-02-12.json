    "fullText": "Jerome Tang buyout, contract details as Kansas State Wildcats coach originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJerome Tang’s contract at Kansas State reflects a growing complexity with the Wildcats’ men’s basketball program.\n\nTang is in the third year of a seven-year contract extension signed in September 2023 that runs through April 30, 2030. The deal, which followed one of the most successful debut seasons in school history, includes escalating base salaries, annual retention bonuses and one of the largest buyout figures in college basketball.\n\nFor the 2025-26 season, Tang’s base salary is approximately $3.6 million. Under the contract’s structure, that figure increases by roughly $100,000 each year, reaching $4 million in 2029-30 and $4.1 million in 2030-31. In addition, Tang is eligible for $200,000 retention bonuses at the conclusion of the 2023-24, 2024-25, 2025-26 and 2026-27 seasons.\n\nThe extension was awarded after Tang’s first season in Manhattan, when Kansas State went 26-10 and finished 11-7 in the Big 12, tying for third in what was widely considered the nation’s toughest conference.\n\nThe Wildcats reached the Elite Eight for the first time since 2017-18, posting the third-most wins in school history. Tang earned the 2023 Werner Ladder Naismith Men’s College Coach of the Year award and was the consensus Big 12 Coach of the Year.\n\nIf Kansas State were to part ways with Tang before April 30, 2026, the buyout would total $18.675 million, according to contract terms via the Topeka Capital-Journal. That figure drops to $15.75 million after the 2026-27 season and gradually declines to $4.4 million between May 2030 and April 2031, or the remaining unpaid salary.\n\nBefore April 30, 2026 — $18.675 million\n\nAfter 2026-27 season — $15.75 million\n\nAfter 2027-28 season — $12.75 million\n\nAfter 2028-29 season — $9.675 million\n\nAfter 2029-30 season — $6.525 million\n\nBetween May 2030 and April 2031 — $4.4 million or remaining unpaid salary\n\nAccording to USA TODAY, it ranks as the 12th-largest buyout in college basketball, placing Kansas State in a potentially historic financial decision as frustration around the program continues to grow for the Kansas State Wildcats.\n\nTang's first season unlocked multiple bonuses. Tang received a $340,000 milestone bonus for completing his first year and became eligible for performance incentives that can exceed $1 million annually, including $200,000 for an Elite Eight appearance, $400,000 for a Final Four and $600,000 for a national championship.\n\nSince his first season, results have declined for Tang and the Wildcats. K-State won 19 games in 2023-24 and 16 in 2024-25, with projections placing the Wildcats near the bottom of the conference in 2025-26 despite significant Name, Image and Likeness investments.

    "fullText": "NBA insider makes blunt Lakers prediction after LeBron James’ comments originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLeBron James set the NBA world off this week after making a blunt comment about comparisons between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\n“You want me to compare us to them? That’s a championship team right there. We’re not. We can’t sustain energy and effort for 48 minutes, and they can. That’s why they won a championship,” James said after a convincing defeat against the champs.\n\nAccording to ESPN’s Tim McMahon, James was described as “in a mood” and “grumpy” after the Tuesday night loss.\n\nCould he have a change of heart with a change of mood? Sure. But McMahon doesn’t seem to be buying it. The NBA insider claimed that James’ statement was a fact. The Lakers are good—but not championship good.\n\n“The Lakers got bounced in the first round last year and probably are getting bounced in the first round this year. They’re not close to a championship team. Sweet—10 games of improved defense—but they’re a bad defensive team.”\n\nYou could certainly consider a first-round exit for the Luka-LeBron Lakers a massive failure this season.\n\nIt would be a stunner to see the Lakers fall out of the playoff picture. They are going to enter the All-Star break as a top-six team in the Western Conference, but they aren’t too far out of the NBA Play-In Tournament.\n\nThe tournament doesn’t guarantee a miss, but it definitely doesn’t guarantee a ticket to the postseason either. The Lakers need to show a lot of improvement in the coming months.\n\nAccording to Basketball Reference’s playoff probability report, the Lakers have a 79 percent chance of cracking the playoffs this season. That’s the seventh-best in the West.\n\nIf the season ended at the break, the Lakers would draw a first-round series against the Denver Nuggets. In one meeting this year, the Lakers defeated the Nuggets, who were missing Nikola Jokic. Denver holds a 35-20 record and is widely viewed as a championship contender in the Western Conference.\n\nAt the end of the day, predictions and probabilities are just a guess. The Lakers haven’t exceeded expectations so far, but there is plenty of basketball left to be played.\n\nJose Alvarado posts stat line never done before in NBA history\n\nIs LeBron James playing vs. Mavericks tonight?\n\nJazz reportedly accused of tanking amid Jaren Jackson Jr. injury as NBA's Adam Silver put on notice\n\nRich Paul dives into why he thinks Heat president Pat Riley is not a fan of today's NBA\n\nIs Cooper Flagg playing tonight vs. Lakers?

    "fullText": "The timing could not have been more perfect.\n\nWhile on the other side of the globe some of the world's best athletes in their sports represent their countries at the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, this year the best of the NBA will take on that international format:\n\nThe pride in representing your country could bring the most competitive All-Star Games we have seen in years. Remember, each of the last seven MVP awards have been won by players born outside the USA — and they are coming to compete.\n\n\"I'm never stepping onto the court to lose, you know, or not caring,\" said the Spurs Victor Wembanyama, who was voted a World starter by the fans. \"Just like at home, I'm never stepping into a board game, not caring or thinking I'm gonna lose, or I'm thinking it's okay to lose.\n\n\"So I'll be out there, might as well win.\"\n\nHere's all you need to know about the 2026 NBA All-Star Game and how not to miss a moment of the action/\n\nWhere: Intuit Dome, Inglewood, CA\n\nThis year, the NBA All-Star Game returns to NBC and debuts on Peacock — and it falls right in the middle of the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics. That was a perfect setup for the first-of-its-kind All-Star Game format, a USA vs. World showdown that fans and players have been asking for.\n\nThe 24 All-Star players have been divided into three teams, two USA teams — USA Stripes and USA Stars — and one World Team. Those three teams will compete in a round-robin tournament of four 12-minute games, each team playing at least two games.\n\nAt the end of the round-robin, the two top teams will play a championship game (the fourth 12-minute game of the day) for the title. (If there is a tie, it comes down to point differential.)\n\nThe 75th NBA All-Star Game will take place on Sunday, Feb. 15, at 5 p.m. Eastern, an earlier time than in previous years, leading into more coverage of the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics.\n\nThere are two USA teams — Stars and Stripes — and one World team. Fans voted for five starters from each of the Western and Eastern Conferences, and the NBA coaches voted in the 14 reserve players (plus NBA Commissioner Adam Silver added one more USA player to balance the rosters, and also picked the injury replacements). The league divided up the teams.\n\n• Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee/Greece)\n• Luka Doncic (Los Angeles Lakers/Slovenia)\n• Nikola Jokic (Denver/Serbia)\n• Victor Wembanyama (San Antonio/France)\n• Karl-Anthony Towns (New York/Dominican Rep.)\n• Pascal Siakam (Indiana/Cameroon)\n• Deni Avdija (Portland/Israel)\n• Jamal Murray (Denver/Canada)\n• Alperen Sengun (Houston/Turkiye)\nCoach: Toronto's Darko Rajakovic (Serbia)\n\n• Cade Cunningham (Detroit)\n• Tyrese Maxey (Philadelphia)\n• Anthony Edwards (Minnesota)\n• Chet Holmgren (Oklahoma City)\n• Jalen Duren (Detroit)\n• Devin Booker (Phoenix)\n• Scottie Barnes (Toronto)\n• Jalen Johnson (Atlanta)\nCoach: Detroit's J.B.

We have followed him for a long time and tried to sign him outright, because that is how we work.”\n\nUDINE, ITALY – AUGUST 20: Napoli linked Giovanni Manna of Juventus during the Serie A TIM match between Udinese Calcio and Juventus at Dacia Arena on August 20, 2023 in Udine, Italy.

    "fullText": "Newcastle United are exploring plans to expand into a multi-club ownership model to prevent the club from missing out on elite young talent, according to Craig Hope.\n\nSenior staff within the Tyneside club have been briefed to prepare for expansion into a wider football network.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), the majority owner of Newcastle, wants to establish a presence in mainland Europe.\n\nWork is already underway to identify suitable partner clubs for Newcastle, with sides in Belgium and France among the options being considered.\n\nSources suggest the expansion could progress as early as this year if the right opportunities emerge.\n\nOne of the key drivers of the move is the challenge posed by post-Brexit transfer regulations.\n\nPremier League clubs are no longer allowed to sign overseas players until they turn 18.\n\nThis has left English sides at a disadvantage when competing with European rivals for the best emerging prospects.\n\nNewcastle’s recruitment team is understood to have detailed knowledge of several highly rated 16- and 17-year-olds across Europe.\n\nHowever, current rules limit their ability to act on that scouting work.\n\nAIK striker Kevin Filling is one example of a player Newcastle admire. The 17-year-old Swedish forward has attracted strong interest across the continent.\n\nThere is a growing belief at Newcastle that he will join a European club that can sign him immediately rather than waiting until he becomes eligible to move to England.\n\nThe situation mirrors the early career of Alexander Isak, who left AIK for Borussia Dortmund at the same age before eventually joining Newcastle in 2022.\n\nA multi-club structure would allow Newcastle to sign and develop young players at partner teams before integrating them into the first-team set-up at St James’ Park.\n\nThe model would also provide additional pathways for loan development.\n\nSporting director Ross Wilson and head of football strategy Jack Ross are reportedly leading the project, alongside senior PIF figures involved in the club’s long-term planning.\n\nChelsea and Manchester City currently employ the multi-club model, and Liverpool been considering a similar move. Newcastle will not want to get left behind.",

    "fullText": "Marcus Rashford has enjoyed a stunning season for his dream club, Barcelona, but he very easily could still be playing at Aston Villa.\n\nRashford hasn’t played for United since a dispute with manager Ruben Amorim back in December 2024.\n\nEven with his high profile, United decided to send Rashford on loan to Aston Villa in January 2025. He performed well during that spell, which led to his move to Barcelona.\n\nBut there was another offer on the table for him before he left England, according to comments from Barcelona director Deco.\n\nAfter being moved into the bomb squad by Amorim last summer, Rashford was keen to join Barcelona and eventually secured a loan move there.\n\nBut according to Barcelona sporting director Deco, there was interest from other clubs as well.\n\nSpeaking to SPORT, Deco revealed that Villa were interested in keeping Rashford after his loan spell but the forward had his sights set elsewhere.\n\n“If Aston Villa could have kept him, they would have – I know because I speak to people there – but he only wanted to come to Barça, and that’s a good thing. He had the desire to come here and we were able to secure him on loan.”\n\n“I think coming here on a reduced salary just to join — that shows he truly wanted to come. And we’re happy with him. He’s a player who gives us a lot.”\n\nIt was reported last month that Michael Carrick wanted Rashford back if he remained in charge next season.\n\nBut even if the club’s new management wanted him back, Rashford has made it clear he wants to stay at Camp Nou.\n\nBarcelona are expected to push for a discount on the previously agreed fee, but Manchester United should refuse any attempts to lower the price. The club needs to be firm and ensure the full payment is made.\n\nThe sale will also help reduce the wage bill, freeing up funds for players who are committed to being at Old Trafford. United need to stand their ground and not give in to any pressure from Barcelona.\n\nIf they truly value Rashford as much as they claim, there should be no issue paying the agreed fee. United need to send a clear message: no discounts, pay up or walk away.\n\nSantan Dave apologises to Harry Maguire as Man Utd defender rebuilds reputation\n\nAndy Mitten shares why Ruben Amorim has stayed quiet since being sacked by Man Utd\n\nGary Neville challenges Roy Keane’s stance on Benjamin Sesko debate",

    "fullText": "Looking back at the Jacksonville Jaguars' 2025 NFL draft class, how did one analyst evaluate the play of this group?\n\nGennaro Filice of NFL.com recently handed out grades for all 32 draft classes and ranked them as well.\n\nWhen it came to the Jaguars, Jacksonville was ranked near the bottom, receiving a C- grade, which was 30th overall.\n\n\"Following a breakout offensive performance against the Rams in London -- Hunter corralled eight passes for 101 yards (both season highs) and his first touchdown in the Week 7 game -- the No. 2 overall pick suffered a non-contact knee injury in practice that abruptly ended his debut campaign,\" wrote Filice.\n\nUnfortunately, injuries were a reality for the Jaguars' 2025 rookie class.\n\nHunter, as Filice mentioned, missed the second half of the season with a knee injury as it looked like he was about to take off on offense.\n\nCaleb Ransaw and Jalen McLeod were both sidelined for the entire season, while Wyatt Milum was injured during training camp and through the first portion of the year.\n\nNow, the Jaguars did get some positive contributions on Day 3 of the draft. Bhayshul Tuten and LeQuint Allen shared the RB2 role, while Jack Kiser and Rayuan Lane were core special teams contributors.\n\nJonah Monheim stepped in at center on a few occasions when needed.\n\nUndrafted rookies BJ Green and Danny Striggow also made the 53-man roster and went from only helping on special teams to filling rotational roles on defense.\n\nIn terms of Year 1 from this rookie class, the Jaguars didn't get a ton of high-end contributions. However, Jacksonville's ability to get steady contributions from Day 3 picks and UDFAs is a good sign for the future, Gladstone said, and the strong processes that Jacksonville has in place.\n\n\"At this point, there's plenty of room for optimism,\" Gladstone said of the draft class.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jaguars Wire: Jaguars 2025 draft class receives lackluster grade from analyst",

    "description": "Pitch stealing is allowed as long as players and coaches don't use in-game technology to steal signs.",
    "fullText": "MLB owners want to make it harder for teams to engage in pitch-stealing tactics on the field. Team owners reportedly voted to approve a rule Thursday that would prevent first- and third-base coaches from leaving their coaches' boxes on the field until after a pitcher throws a pitch, according to ESPN's Jesse Rogers.\n\nMLB owners wanted to crack down on the tactic due to concern over first- and third-base coaches moving up and down the foul line to try to get a better view of the pitcher, per ESPN. If those coaches discovered what pitch was coming, they would reportedly relay that information directly to the batter or to a runner on second base, who could signal to the hitter what pitch was coming.\n\nThe league attempted to curb the tactic during the 2025 World Series, when it told both the Los Angeles Dodgers and Toronto Blue Jays to make sure their first- and third-base coaches stayed in their designated coaches' boxes on the field.\n\nWith the creation of PitchCom, the art of stealing catcher signs is essentially extinct around the league. Because MLB teams will try to exploit any advantage possible, teams and coaches have turned to extensive film study ahead of games, trying to find tells from the pitcher or catcher to determine what pitch is coming next. Unlike the pitch-stealing scandal the Houston Astros engaged in during the 2017 MLB season, this version of pitch-stealing is completely legal since it doesn't rely on the in-game use of technology.\n\nIn 2017, the Astros were accused of using cameras and video monitors to steal signs from their opponents. After MLB conducted an investigation into those claims, commissioner Rob Manfred announced one-year suspensions for then-Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow and then-manager A.J. Hinch. Shortly after those suspensions were announced, the Astros fired both men.\n\nBoston Red Sox manager Alex Cora was later suspended for a year for his involvement in the scandal. Cora previously coached with the Astros before being hired by the Red Sox in 2018. The Red Sox fired Cora ahead of the 2020 season, but brought him back for the 2021 MLB season.\n\nPlayers and coaches are allowed to steal signs from pitchers or catchers during games without the use of technology, but MLB reportedly felt first- and third-base coaches were getting too brazen with their tactics, per ESPN.\n\nThe MLB rulebook states the first- and third-base coaches must remain in their coaches' box from the time the pitcher steps on the pitching rubber to the time the ball is caught by the catcher or put in play. Coaches, however, are allowed to leave the coaches' box for safety reasons.\n\nUnder the new rule, first- and third-base coaches will receive a warning for their first violation. After that, coaches could be ejected from games for leaving the coaches' box too early, per ESPN.",

She reached the Abu Dhabi Open quarter-finals last week, before being knocked out in the first round of the Qatar Open.\n\nAmid the hustle and bustle of the tennis Tour, Eala has taken time to share some of her wisdom.\n\nAs per a post on the Rafa Nadal Academy Instagram page, Eala said: “I think the most important skill as a student athlete is to know how to compartmentalise.\n\n“And if I’m being frank, when I was on tournament, I never wanted to do any kind of school work, never wanted to do any kind of homework, any kind of google classes.\n\n“No [laughing] I never wanted to do it just because I was so focused on the tournament and you’re always like, tense even when you’re not on court.\n\n“So what I felt it was important is to know when is the right time to do what. And when you have a certain time where you’re competing – okay, all your focus is on the competition.\n\n“And when you have the time to study, for example, all your attention is on studying. So you maximise your efforts and you maximise your time.”\n\nEala is set to travel to the UAE to take part in the Dubai Tennis Championships. Eala, who will enter the tournament through qualifying, will make her debut appearance at the event.\n\nFollowing her appearance in Dubai, Eala will likely travel to North America to take part in the Indian Wells Open – where she will defend 390 WTA points.\n\nIn September last year, Eala won her maiden WTA title at the Guadalajara 125k event in Mexico.\n\nThe title win confirmed what many had been thinking prior to the success: Eala is one of the most promising talents on the WTA Tour.\n\nHowever, she is yet to capture a first WTA Tour-level title: a tournament that offers 250 ranking points – or more – to the winner.\n\nEala’s best effort to date came at the 2025 Eastbourne Open, where she lost in the final to Maya Joint, despite having championship points.\n\nEala has more than proven that she can win a WTA Tour-level event. However, whether she can deliver on her potential remains to be seen.",

In that series, MSR runs a No. 60 Acura ARX-06 in the GTP class, with a sister car, No. 93 entry, serviced by the majority of HRC representatives.\n\n“We do it already,” Salters said. “We know what to do.

It works very well with MSR.\n\n“Right now, that's how we would envisage proceeding, and those are the types of discussions we're having.”\n\nThe new agreement with IndyCar features a unique caveat that both Chevrolet and Honda have an opportunity to field a factory entry with the new car and engine set to debut in 2028.\n\nCurrent charter rules limit teams to three cars, which leaves both manufacturers looking for either an individual effort alone or partnering with a program with two or less charter entrants.

    "fullText": "Stefon Diggs was the New England Patriots’ leading receiver with 1,013 receiving yards during the regular season, while recording team highs in targets (102) and receptions (85) as well.\n\nThe four-time Pro Bowler disappeared during parts of the playoffs though, finishing the postseason with just 14 catches for 110 yards and one touchdown.\n\nThe Boston Herald’s Andrew Callahan and the Boston Sports Journal’s Mike Giardi discussed Diggs’ chances of returning to the Patriots in the fall, with the latter putting the odds at less than 50 percent.\n\nGiardi cited the financial impact of bringing back Diggs versus signing a different wide receiver like Indianapolis Colts deep threat Alec Pierce.\n\nDiggs inked a three-year deal with New England last offseason but played this season on just a $2.9 million base salary with a cap hit of $8.7 million. That figure will skyrocket to $26.5 million for the 2026 campaign.\n\n“I’m still not certain he’s on the team (next season),” Giardi said on the “Pats Interference Podcast.” “This might in fact in some way tie into Pierce. Just because, if you’re really going to go all in, like I said, that’s going to be expensive.”\n\n“This negotiation’s going to be fascinating. I agree with you,” Callahan said. “It’s not a guarantee (that Diggs returns). I would put it as likely.”\n\n“I’m leaning more towards the unlikely,” Giardi countered. “47 percent (Diggs) stays, 53 (percent) goes. Something like that. … Again, what did they see from him in the last four weeks in the postseason when it really got sticky? Am I really going to give that guy (that money), even if you re-work the guarantees?”\n\nFollowing the Patriots’ Super Bowl LX loss, the former Minnesota Vikings, Buffalo Bills and Houston Texans pass-catcher spoke about possibly returning to New England, saying, “I anticipate being here, so I hope so,” and adding “I don’t control it though.”\n\n“I don’t have a great feeling about that,” Giardi said. “I think if (the Patriots) were being smart, they’d look at his past history and say, ‘Yeah, year one always tends to be great. What happens in year two and year three and do we want to attach ourselves to that, at 32 (years old) going on 33 when you’re hoping and expecting to play in January again, when he just disappeared this January? And oh by the way, in Buffalo he disappeared in January too.'”\n\nDiggs has averaged 5.9 receptions and 71.5 receiving yards across 161 career regular season games, but just 4.6 catches and 56.6 yards per contest during 18 playoff tilts.\n\nPatriots Legend Tom Brady Roasts Logan Paul Over Ridiculous Claims",

    "title": "Jim Ratcliffe apologises for claiming Britain has been ‘colonised’ by migrants as FA looks into comments",
    "description": "The Ineos founder said he was sorry if he ‘offended some people’ with his remarks, but insisted that is important to ‘raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth’",
    "fullText": "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has offered a lukewarm apology for his claim Britain has been “colonised” by migrants, as the FA confirmed it would look into whether the comments have brought the game into disrepute.\n\nThe Manchester United co-owner said he was sorry if he “offended some people” with his remarks, but insisted that was important to “raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth”.\n\nSir Jim, one of Britain’s richest men, faced growing backlash for the comments and was under pressure from a string of high-profile politicians, including Sir Keir Starmer, to apologise.\n\nThe prime minister said the comments were “offensive and wrong”, while Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said they were “inaccurate, insulting and inflammatory”.\n\nIf the FA finds Sir Jim’s remarks brought the game into disrepute, he is likely to be hit with a financial penalty.\n\nIt came after Sir Jim, who founded the chemical giant Ineos in 1998, told Sky News: “You can’t have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in. I mean, the UK is being colonised. It’s costing too much money. The UK has been colonised by immigrants.”\n\nIn a statement released on Thursday, the billionaire said: “I am sorry that my choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe and caused concern, but it is important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth.\n\n“My comments were made while answering questions about UK policy at the European Industry Summit in Antwerp, where I was discussing the importance of economic growth, jobs, skills and manufacturing in the UK.\n\n“My intention was to stress that governments must manage migration alongside investment in skills, industry and jobs so that long-term prosperity is shared by everyone. It is critical that we maintain an open debate on the challenges facing the UK.”\n\nThe apology was welcomed by the prime minister’s official spokesperson, who told reporters: “The prime minister asked for an apology, and one’s been issued, and it’s absolutely right that Jim Ratcliffe has apologised for that language.”\n\nPressed on whether it went far enough, the official said: “It’s right that he’s apologised. It’s for Mr Ratcliffe to speak to his apology… It’s not for me.”\n\nConfirming that there had been no contact between Downing Street and Sir Jim about his comments, the spokesperson added: “We are of course of the view that there should be a serious debate about immigration, but the prime minister believes in a Britain built for all, and that those comments were inflammatory and divisive.”\n\nOthers have said the apology does not go far enough, with Minnie Rahman, head of the refugee charity Praxis, dubbing it “half-hearted”. Writing for LBC, she said: “Blaming migrants for today’s economic problems is a convenient way to dodge responsibility for that failure. His half-hearted apology only underlines the point: powerful men are quick to inflame division, but slow to accept accountability for the consequences.”\n\nTthe Conservative peer and former transport secretary Mark Harper said the apology could have been “a little more generous”, describing it as “one of those terrible ‘I’m sorry if I’ve offended anyone’ apologies”.\n\nMr Burnham, who previously backed plans driven by Sir Jim to regenerate Old Trafford and build a new stadium for Manchester United, had said the remarks “go against everything for which Manchester has traditionally stood”. He added that “footballers who have arrived from all over the world to play in Greater Manchester have enhanced the life of our city region”.\n\nThe mayor then appeared to hit out at United’s ownership, saying: “If any criticism is needed, it should be directed towards those who have offered little contribution to our life here and have instead spent years siphoning wealth out of one of our proudest institutions.”\n\nKick It Out, the anti-discrimination football campaign group, said Sir Jim’s comments were “disgraceful and deeply divisive” and also criticised his claim that the UK population had swollen by 12 million since 2020, which has proved to be inaccurate.\n\nManchester United said it “prides itself on being an inclusive and welcoming club” that has “embedded equality, diversity and inclusion into everything we do”.\n\n“Our diverse group of players, staff and global community of supporters reflect the history and heritage of Manchester, a city that anyone can call home,” the club said in a statement posted to social media. “We will continue to represent our people, our city and our fans with purpose and pride.”\n\nSir Jim bought a minority share in Manchester United in late 2023 and his Ineos group has since taken control of football operations.\n\nThe Football Association is understood to be examining whether his comments have brought the game into disrepute, as well as looking to whether they breached its regulations.\n\nShould the FA choose to formally investigate, the probe may be focused on FA Rule E3.1, which covers general behaviour, and states: “A participant shall at all times act in the best interests of the game and shall not act in any manner which is improper or brings the game into disrepute or use any one, or a combination of, violent conduct, serious foul play, threatening, abusive, indecent or insulting words or behaviour.”\n\nThe FA’s guidance says there are “no set sanctions for media comments or social networking comments cases. However, financial penalties are the most usual form of sanction for these kind of cases.” Sir Jim, as a club co-owner, is subject to FA rules as a participant.",

    "fullText": "Steve Tisch’s Jeffrey Epstein problem may not be over at all, after new reports revealed that he communicated with the convicted sex offender for a longer period of time than he initially admitted.\n\nThe Giants’ co-owner’s name emerged in the last release of Epstein files. He issued a statement to explain the nature of his relationship with Epstein.\n\n“We had a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition, we discussed movies, philanthropy, and investments.”\n\nThe explanation didn’t please many people, and new findings show that “brief” may not be the best word to describe their relationship and communication. According to Nathan Fenno, Carson Kessler and Katie Strang of The Athletic, Steve Tisch and Jeffrey Epstein met up for the first time after the Giants’ co-owner accepted an invitation for breakfast.\n\nAt the time of that meeting, Epstein had been sued repeatedly by sex abuse victims. Additionally, he had served 13 months of work-release custody and registered as a Level 3 sex offender. In the following weeks and months, Epstein introduced Tisch to at least four women.\n\nSome of them reportedly attempted to pursue careers in acting and modeling. One of the women emailed Epstein that “Steve” had “been so weird” and she didn’t want to keep in contact with him. After that moment, Epstein stopped introducing women to the Hollywood producer.\n\nThey last emailed each other in August 2017. Epstein invited Tisch to visit him.\n\nDuring a press conference ahead of Super Bowl 60, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell addressed the Tisch-Epstein connection. He announced that the league will gather as much information as possible before making a decision.\n\n“Absolutely, we will look at all the facts,” Goodell said. “We’ll look at the context of those and try to understand that. We’ll look at how that falls under the [league’s personal conduct] policy. I think we’ll take one step at a time. Let’s get the facts first.”\n\nThe Giants’ initial statement attempted to downplay the situation, but that might not be enough as more documents are released.\n\nOLYMPICS: Norway skier goes viral after displaying insane Winter Olympics speed\n\nSUPER BOWL: Ranking the last 10 NFL Super Bowl champions\n\nMLB: Texas Rangers’ Nolan Ryan jersey giveaway is a bloody mess\n\nMEDIA: Photos of potential suspect in Nancy Guthrie disappearance released by FBI\n\nNBA: NBA Power Rankings ahead of 2026 All-Star Break\n\nVIRAL: Norwegian Olympics star makes stunning girlfriend admission after winning bronze medal\n\nThe post Steve Tisch’s ‘brief’ association with Jeffrey Epstein debunked by new releases appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "The Republic of Ireland will fulfil their Nations League fixtures with Israel due to the potential of disqualification, says the Football Association of Ireland (FAI).\n\nIsrael were drawn with the Republic of Ireland, Austria and Kosovo in League B3 in Thursday's draw.\n\nIn November, the FAI overwhelmingly approved a motion to call on Uefa to ban Israel from European club and international competitions.\n\nIn a statement following the draw, the FAI said it had consulted with Uefa and sanctions for not fulfilling a fixture could lead to disqualification from the Nations League.\n\nIn September, there were reports Uefa may hold a vote on whether to suspend Israel from club and international competition.\n\nHowever, such a move never materialised and any prospect of that happening receded after the announcement of the Israel-Hamas peace plan for Gaza in October.\n\nWhen asked about having to deal with possible implications of the Israel fixture, Republic of Ireland manager Heimir Hallgrimsson said \"it's not my job\".\n\n\"That's not my job, my job is to focus on the football side and I'm going to do that,\" Hallgrimsson told BBC Sport in Brussels.\n\nThe FAI's statement read: \"In 2025, a motion was proposed by members of the FAI General Assembly to vote on issuing a formal request to the UEFA Executive Committee for the immediate suspension of the Israel Football Association from UEFA competitions for a breach of UEFA statutes.\n\n\"Members then voted in favour to submit the motion to UEFA, which the Association did in November 2025.\n\n\"While consultation has taken place with Uefa officials, the Association does recognise that Uefa regulations outline that if an association refuses to play a match then that fixture will be forfeited and further disciplinary measures may follow – including potential disqualification from the competition.\"\n\nDates for fixtures for the Nations League have yet to be released but the competition is set to open with a quadruple header from 23 September until 4 October, before two final fixtures in November.\n\nEngland to face Spain and Croatia in Nations League\n\nIn August, Basketball Ireland said it would fulfil EuroBasket qualifiers with Israel after \"extensive deliberation\" after sanctions were threatened if they did not play the games.\n\nAfter considering its options, which included a withdrawal from the qualifiers, Basketball Ireland decided to play the two games in November and March but the body informed FIBA, European basketball's governing body, they will only face Israel at a neutral venue.\n\nIn a previous encounter, Ireland refused to shake hands with Israel and stood at the side of the court for the national anthems in a 2025 EuroBasket qualifier in February 2024.\n\nWhen Irish players raised concerns before that qualifier, Israel player Dor Saar said the Ireland team was \"quite antisemitic\".\n\nIreland were warned by Fiba for their protest, and players stood for the anthems on court and shook hands with Israel's players in a second EuroBasket qualifier between the sides in Riga that November.",

    "description": "After a cardiac arrest Patrick Charnley was clinically dead. He came back to life a changed man.",
    "fullText": "Dying doesn't normally give a person new life - yet that is exactly what happened to Patrick Charnley.\n\nHe was a high-flying lawyer, who viewed downtime as \"wasted time\", restlessly pushing himself to success.\n\nBut working long hours during the pandemic in 2021, the ultra-fit father-of-two suffered a cardiac arrest aged 39.\n\nWhat began as an unremarkable evening eating sausage and chips on the sofa ended with him collapsing unconscious.\n\nTriggered by a hereditary condition, his heart stopped. Patrick was clinically dead for 40 minutes. His wife performed CPR, while his daughter and son, then nine and seven, ran to get help.\n\nParamedics' defibrillation attempts failed. With his life slipping away, they tried adrenaline shots as a \"kind of final roll of the dice\", says Patrick.\n\nThey \"shocked and shocked and shocked [me]\", he adds. His wife began to suspect he was lost.\n\nThen suddenly his heart began beating again.\n\nPatrick awoke from his week-long coma a changed man, with a brain injury that affects his sight, memory and stamina.\n\nUnable to work and live as he did before, he feels it's allowed him to be more present in life and relationships.\n\nIt's a perspective shift, he tells Emma Barnett's Ready to Talk podcast, that he \"wouldn't change\" - even if given the chance to return to his old life.\n\nStill the journey to today's acceptance has been deeply traumatic.\n\n\"I woke up blind,\" says Patrick of his first waking memory. \"I was experiencing these things, but not really connecting with them.\"\n\nThe loss of his eyesight sparked vivid hallucinations. Known as Charles Bonnet Syndrome, the phenomenon is the brain's way of \"filling in\" sudden missing visual data.\n\nWhile some of these were \"frightening\" he says others felt \"great\" and strangely beautiful.\n\nIn one, after his open heart surgery, he became convinced an American nurse was trying to murder him.\n\nBut these hallucinations could also provide calm. One took him to a sanitorium in the Alps, where he looked out across the snowy mountains while nurses chatted next door. The experience gave him a \"blissful\" sense of safety.\n\nAs his vision slowly returned, doctors realised his sight issues were linked to a brain injury. His eyesight remains partially impaired, comparable to \"looking through a telescope\".\n\nInitial cognitive tests put him in the bottom 2% across memory and processing speed. Although vastly improved, he still has significant cognitive problems.\n\nBut the full impact of his injuries only became apparent once he returned home.\n\nSevere fatigue means he has to budget his energy. \"I never, ever wake up feeling refreshed. I wake up exhausted every day, and it gets worse as the day goes on,\" he explains.\n\nThere have also been mental changes to adjust to. Patrick found he \"didn't care about anything\" after his initial recovery. This wasn't depression per se, but a condition known as pathological apathy that Patrick describes as feeling like \"floating through time\" without solid ground.\n\nTherapy and medication have helped to revive his motivation, with a psychologist encouraging him to grieve the life he'd lost. Still, Patrick says he misses the spontaneity of life, and fitting in with people his age by \"participating in society\" as expected, as well as actively playing with his children.\n\nHe also feels regret for his wife, who he feels he's \"outsourced\" his memory to. \"The truth is that she is my carer, really,\" he admits.\n\n\"I sort of live as if I'm really very, very old.\"\n\nDespite the vast changes, Patrick says in many ways he prefers this life. He has changed careers to become an author and says he now has more time to enjoy life.\n\n\"I live life slowly now, not by choice, but because I have to. But I really appreciate that. I do see the beauty in things much more than I used to… I feel like I live a much richer existence by being slower,\" he says.\n\n\"My perspective has fundamentally altered. I feel grateful to be alive\".\n\nHis relationship with his family has also changed for the better.\n\nHe is able to laugh at the quirks of his condition with them. \"I think we're more solid than ever, really… we have a much closer bond because of what's happened,\" he adds.\n\n\"The most important thing to me has always been my family, but now I am able to give so much more of myself to it. Before I was living almost on the surface of it,\" he says.\n\nPatrick's unique situation has allowed him to break free of the daily work grind.\n\n\"So many people feel like that… I'm too busy to live my life. I wouldn't change what happened.\n\n\"Even with the limitations, I like my life now. I like being home when the children come home from school. I like not rushing from one thing to the next.\"\n\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.",

    "description": null,
    "fullText": "The Golden Spider Silk Cape is a unique textile woven from the silk of over 1.2 million Madagascar red-legged golden orb-weaver spiders (Trichonephila inaurata madagascariensis). Created by Simon Peers and Nicholas Godley[1]. The textile is not dyed; the golden hue is created by light refraction, and is the natural colour of the spider silk. The cape, which has been described as one of the rarest textiles on Earth,[2] took approximately three years to produce. Its creation required meticulous, labour-intensive processes that combined ancient textile techniques with modern innovation. The Golden Spider Silk Cape was first publicly displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) in London in 2012[3], and has gone on to feature prominently in several other museum exhibitions.\n\nUsing spider silk in place of traditional silk has a long history. The first printed reference to spider silk thread is from Italy in 1621, where Dr. Epifanio Ferdinando spun Tarantula egg sacs into a yarn, producing a small amount (just 450 grams/16 oz). In 1709, François-Xavier Bon de Saint-Hilaire began collecting spiders to gather cocoons and spin the fibers into threads. His treatise, Dissertation sur l’utilité de la soye des araignées, was published in 1710. Its success led to translation into Italian, English, Latin, and, at the request of Emperor Kangxi, into Chinese. In spite of the small amount of usable fiber produced by collecting a large amount of cocoons, Bon de Saint-Hilaire was able to produce some spider silk objects, including stockings and gloves, all given to assorted European royalty.\n\nUnaware of these antecedents, Spanish Jesuit priest Raimondo Maria de Termeyer began exploring the production of spider silk in 1796. Instead of collecting cocoons in the wild, de Termeyer established a spider farm, producing over 2,000 cocoons. In addition to the books he published on entomology, physics, and agriculture, de Termeyer wrote about spider silk, helping the idea to gain popularity in Europe, and proposing the harvesting of fiber directly from the spider instead of reclaiming it from a cocoon. He was able to produce a pair of spider silk stockings for King Charles III of Spain, and his pupil Carlo Sommaschi produced a large spider silk shawl for Empress Josephine.\n\nLater in the 19th century, French Jesuit missionary Father Paul Camboué, located in Madagascar, realized that by establishing a system for collecting golden orb spiders and harvesting their silk, the resulting long, strong, golden-hued fibers would improve the strength and visual appeal of textiles made of spider silk. Camboué's work inspired French colonial authorities, led by M. Nogué, to produce textiles on a larger scale than previously possible, culminating in a bed canopy, now lost, for the colonial exhibition at the 1900 Paris Exposition Universelle.\n\nIn an effort to revive the history of harvesting threads from spiders, and to determine the possibility of creating a textile with these threads, Nicholas Godley, an American entrepreneur, and Simon Peers, a British textile artist and historian, began collecting spider silk in Madagascar in 2005. They have now created four textiles: two shawls[4], a large textile[5][6], and the Golden Spider Silk Cape. [7][8]\n\nTo produce just one ounce of spider silk thread requires 23,000 spiders.[2] Producing the cape required 1.5 kg (53 oz) of thread. The thinnest threads used for the production of the cape were made of 24 strands of spider silk, with warp threads and embroidery floss being made of multiples of this basic thread twisted together, requiring as many as 96 individual strands.[9] Only female golden orb spiders are capable of producing the thread used. Each spider produced about 100 feet (30 meters) of silk per extraction session, which took approximately five minutes each. After the silk was extracted, the spiders were released back into the wild to continue their natural life cycle.\n\nMore than 70 workers gathered spiders to produce the thread. Once the base fabric for the cape was woven, a team of highly skilled embroiderers spent a total of 6,000 hours adding the embroidered patterns. Peers's design for the embroidery includes scores of spiders weaving webs and floral motifs to illustrate the spiders' natural habitat. The design takes advantage of the widest possible range of embroidery stitches. Satin stitch, French knot, seed and split stitching, and couching twisted ropes onto the surface all produce different surfaces and textures, maximizing the thread's natural light refraction to bring the surface alive.\n\nThe front of the cape is closed with a multi-tiered vertical cascade of raw spider silk, showing the fiber in a more natural state to offer contrast with the highly controlled embroidered surface of the cape.\n\nThe Golden silk Cape was first exhibited at the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) in London in 2012 alongside the golden silk lamba[5] made by Godley and Peers in 2008, as well as other rare fabrics.[10]\n\nThe cape's exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum generated significant media attention and widespread acclaim from both art experts and the general public.[11] It has since been displayed at the Royal Ontario Museum[12][13][14] in 2018, and the Museum of Islamic Art, Qatar[15], 2024 .\n\nThe work Nicholas Godley and Simon Peers have done to revive the ancient art of creating textiles with spider silk has inspired further research into the potential applications of spider silk in various industries, including biomedical engineering and high-performance materials.[16][17]",

    "description": "Discover George Washington Carver’s quiet lifelong passion for crochet and fancywork and download free crochet patterns for his swatches.",
    "fullText": "Most of us know George Washington Carver (about 1864–1943) as the famous African American agronomist from Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University) who spent his career working to improve the lives of poor Southern farmers. But as a young man, Carver envisioned himself becoming a professional fine-art painter and enrolled in college as an art major in 1890. Because of his talent for painting flowers and plants and because of the well-established stereotype of a struggling artist, Carver’s art instructor convinced him to change his major to botany. Carver went on to dedicate his life to serving struggling rural families by teaching sustainable agricultural methods, introducing new crops and developing new markets for them. Still, Carver never abandoned his artistic interests, especially painting and crochet, continuing to pursue them as personal pastimes throughout his lifetime.\n\nGeorge Washington Carver had an unusual childhood. He was born near the end of the Civil War to Mary, an enslaved woman, whose owner, Moses Carver, didn’t approve of slavery (see note 1). Moses and three brothers had moved to Diamond Grove, Missouri, in 1838. It was near there that Moses and his wife, Susan, settled. When his widower brother Richard died shortly after arriving in Diamond Grove, Moses and Susan took in his three children, having none of their own. These children grew up helping with the farm work but by 1860 had moved out leaving an aging Moses and Susan with no help on a 240-acre farm. Hired help was scarce. Anyone with an interest in farming could just move a little farther west and homestead their own place. Moses was able to hire one man but couldn’t find help for Susan, so Moses resorted to buying Mary from a neighbor.\n\nThe Civil War was a lawless time in southwest Missouri. Shortly after George’s birth, raiders descended on the Carver farm and kidnapped Mary and George, probably with the intent of selling them to slave owners farther east. Moses hired John Bentley, a Union scout in nearby Neosho, to bring them back. Bentley found George abandoned by the kidnappers but didn’t find Mary. George had contracted whooping cough and was nearly dead when Bentley returned him. Susan nursed George back to health, but he was small and sickly throughout his childhood.\n\nWith the disappearance of Mary, Moses and Susan cared for the orphans—George and his half-brother, Jim. Jim, being older and of a rugged build, helped Moses with the heavier farm chores. George’s health concerns often left him confined to the house. He watched Susan do household chores and helped her when he could, becoming proficient in cooking, laundry, and needlework.\n\nGeorge Washington Carver standing in a plowed field, likely at the Tuskegee Institute, holding soil in 1906. Photo by Frances Benjamin Johnson, Booker T. Washington Collection. Courtesy of the Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division\n\nGeorge enjoyed needlework and pursued it as a pastime. As he stated in a 1931 letter to Isabelle Coleman, “If I had leisure time from roaming the woods and fields, I put it in knitting, crocheting, and other forms of fancy work (see note 2).” All of these skills he picked up at a young age (he only lived with the Carvers until he was eleven years old) and sometimes in the most unorthodox ways. George watched Susan knitting and decided he wanted to try. Apparently, Susan’s needles were either all in use or he wasn’t permitted to use them, so he stripped the barbs from two turkey feathers, leaving a little tuft at the tips. Then, he raveled the tops of an old mitten and sock, and he began knitting a strip with colored stripes (see note 3).\n\nGeorge found crochet even more fascinating than knitting. The Carvers were frugal, buying little in town except sugar and coffee, but the boys were allowed to take turns accompanying Moses on his twice-yearly trips to Neosho. George might be given a little spending money, and on one trip, he bought a steel and bone crochet hook (see note 4). George could barely read and had no pattern books, but he must have had some brief instruction combined with experimentation. Mariah Watkins, with whom Carver would board from age eleven to twelve, commented, “He could walk uptown and see a set of collar and cuffs on a woman’s dress, come home, and crochet the same (see note 5).”\n\nGeorge began his formal education at home. As George recalls in a 1922 letter, “Mr. and Mrs. Carver taught me to read, spell and write just a little” (see note 6) using a blue back speller, (see note 7) which was the only book in the Carver home. “From a child I had an inordinate desire for knowledge, and especially for music, painting, flowers and the sciences . . . Mr. and Mrs. Carver were very kind to me and I thank them so much for my home training. They encouraged me to secure knowledge helping me all they could, but this was quite limited. As we lived in the country no colored schools were available so I was permitted to go 8 miles to a school at town (Neosho)(see note 8).”\n\nStephen Frost, George’s Black teacher at the Neosho Colored School, had little more education than young George himself. George soon left Neosho seeking further education. For several years, he moved from one town to another through Missouri, Kansas, and Iowa, searching for schools with more advanced curriculums that would accept him. He supported himself and paid for school expenses with the domestic skills he had learned. “I had become more or less skilled in all kinds of homecrafts, such as cooking, laundrying [sic], and many kinds of fancy work. I found employment just as a girl (see note 9).”\n\nThe year 1889 found George Washington Carver, now a man in his late twenties, in Winterset, Iowa, opening a laundry. With the encouragement of friends in Winterset, Carver began saving money to once again enroll in school, this time at Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa, 25 miles away. Carver matriculated in 1890 studying art with the idea of becoming a fine-art painter, and his finest paintings were of flowers and plants. In spite of Carver’s obvious talent, Etta Budd, his painting instructor, was concerned about the challenges Carver would face in working as an artist. Etta’s father was Professor of Horticulture at Iowa Agricultural College (now Iowa State University), and the two of them convinced Carver to change his major to botany and enroll at Iowa Agricultural College, effectively ending Carver’s work as a professional domestic.\n\nLeft: Carver’s crochet work exhibited at the George Washington Carver Museum in 2007.

Polk, a noted Black photographer who served as head of the Photography Department at Tuskegee Institute, remain in the collection of Tuskegee University. Photos by P. H. Polk, courtesy of Tuskegee University\n\nCarver managed to find time to continue his painting and crochet despite his busy teaching and research schedule. He struck up a friendship with fellow teacher Mrs. Adella Logan. Adella had graduated from Atlanta University with a university’s broader, more worldly education. Like Carver, she had an interest in the arts. Adella admired Carver’s paintings and encouraged his artistic talents. A few years later, Sarah Hunt, Adella’s sister, also graduated from Atlanta University and came to teach at Tuskegee. The three of them frequently met for lunch and needlework.\n\nWhen looking at photographs taken of Carver’s 1941 crochet exhibit, we see crocheted items that consist mostly of elaborate edging swatches and a few doilies. In 2018, I had the opportunity to view Carver’s needlework collection located in the archives of the Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site. The crocheted pieces in the collection are those shown in the 1941 photos. About half of the pieces in the photos are still located in the archives. Nearly all of his crochet was thread/lace work.\n\nExamples of Carver’s crochet swatches remain in the George Washington Carver Museum in Tuskegee, Alabama. Photo by Curtis Gregor\n\nFor two reasons, I think all of these items were crocheted after Carver arrived at Tuskegee. First is the style. During the Victorian period (through 1901), crochet was commonly used for fashion accessories, such as miser purses, collar and cuff sets, gloves, and more. None of these items were in Carver’s collection. Second, doilies and elaborate edgings are always worked from a written pattern of some kind. There were few patterns before 1900, but by 1915, most women’s magazines included crochet patterns, and several needlework companies were producing copious numbers of pattern books. I have located at least a half dozen of the original patterns for Carver’s swatches in period publications.\n\nMost of Carver’s extant crochet consists of swatches and doilies, but that doesn’t mean that’s all he created. He crocheted his own neckties from threads treated with dyes he created in order to test colorfastness. He kept a few doilies in his apartment, others were used as gifts. He gave an intricate Irish crochet collar to a student. From objects including a filet swatch with the word “Baby” and another with little ducks, we can assume he crocheted baby gifts for expecting friends.\n\nWhile most of Carver’s crochet was for his personal enjoyment, he did create some crocheted pieces, such as the rag rug he is crocheting on page 18, as models for his rural outreach programs at the Tuskegee Institute’s agricultural experiment station. Carver’s experiment-station research focused on helping poor farming families establish alternative crops, improve health and nutrition, and boost household economics. Textiles in his experiment-station work relied on discarded materials, such as rags, old burlap bags, and waste plant fibers. Carver used these accessible materials to create useful and beautiful textiles. I look forward to sharing more about this work in an upcoming PieceWork article.\n\nAuthor’s Note: This article would not have been possible without the assistance of Curtis Gregory, Park Ranger, George Washington Carver National Monument, and Robyn Green Harris, Museum Specialist, Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site—and I thank them.\n\nNancy Nehring re-created some of Carver’s swatches in the Spring 2021 issue of PieceWork.

Its workhorse MiG-21 was retired in September and other early variants of the MiG-29, the Anglo-French Jaguar and the French Mirage 2000, are also set to end service in the coming years.\n\nNew Delhi has long relied on ‌importing machinery and weapons for its ⁠armed forces, but a recent push by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has helped boost domestic manufacturing.\n\nFor the Indian Air Force, this era began in ⁠the 1980s but was fruitful only in the last decade when the locally produced Tejas fighter jet was introduced to replace Soviet-era MiG-21s.\n\nHindustan Aeronautics (HAL) has nearly 180 of the advanced Mk-1A variants of the ​Tejas ​on order domestically, but has yet to begin deliveries ​due to engine supply chain issues ‌at GE Aerospace.\n\nThe defence ministry said the Defence Acquisition Council had given the initial nod for more Rafale fighter jets and missiles for the air force, anti-tank missiles for the army and P-8I reconnaissance aircraft for its navy.\n\nThe total value of all these proposals stands at 3.6 trillion rupees, the statement said. It did not elaborate further.\n\nThe approvals come ahead of a visit ‌by French President Emmanuel Macron to India next week. ​The Indian Air Force's fleet currently includes Rafale fighters ​from Dassault Aviation.\n\nIn April, India signed ​a deal for 26 Rafale-Marine twin- and single-seat jets to be deployed on ‌its two carriers: INS Vikrant and INS ​Vikramaditya.\n\nSeparately, the defence ministry ​on Thursday also signed a deal with HAL to buy eight Dornier 228 aircraft for the coastguard.\n\nThe proposals pave the way for commercial and technical details to be ​finalized soon.\n\nEarlier in the day, ‌local media reported that the DAC had given its approval to buy 114 Rafale ​fighter jets from Dassault for 3.25 trillion rupees.",

    "description": "D-Wave Quantum is taking an unusual approach to quantum computing.",
    "fullText": "The artificial intelligence (AI) trend may be at the forefront of most investors' thoughts, but there's another important tech trend on the horizon: quantum computing. Although commercially relevant quantum computing isn't expected to arrive until 2030 at the earliest, by then, most of the gains to be made from quantum computing stocks will already be in the books.\n\nOne popular stock pick in this space is D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS), as it's a pure play that's vying for massive market share. But is it the best quantum computing stock to invest in right now?\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nMost quantum computing companies are attempting to create broad-purpose quantum computing units that can essentially be used in many of the same scenarios that a classical supercomputer would be used in. This is obviously the biggest market opportunity, but it's more difficult than making a more specialized unit that's suitable for solving a narrower swath of problems.\n\nD-Wave is taking the latter approach. Its quantum computer is built around a technology called quantum annealing, which identifies some of the lowest energy states of a system. In a computing context, those states represent optimal or nearly optimal answers.\n\nFortunately for D-Wave, many of the already-identified potential use cases for quantum computers are optimization problems -- among them, weather modeling, logistics networks, AI inference and training, and statistics. One unnamed Fortune 100 company recently inked a $10 million, two-year deal with D-Wave to explore its quantum computing capabilities. If this relationship pans out, it could lead to a much bigger deal.\n\nCommercial relevance is starting to arrive, but does that make D-Wave Quantum the best way to play this trend?\n\nIt's impossible to tell which companies will provide the best solutions in quantum computing. The eventual leader may even be one that's not trading on the public markets yet. The reality is, many pure plays won't pan out, and D-Wave could be one of them. Furthermore, there are numerous giant tech companies with massive resources at their disposal competing in this space as well. D-Wave's more specialized approach could be the factor that allows it to thrive, or it could just position it to get squashed by the competition.",

It sees the benchmark index rising as high as 8,000 in 2026, before falling to 7,000 next year in a drop of about 13% to a \"more normal level,\" the firm wrote on Monday.\n\n\"A more plausible scenario is that the stock market 'collapses under its own weight' as investors reassess stretched valuations for major tech firms while still believing in AI's long-term benefits for the real economy,\" Jennifer McKeown and William Jackson, two economists at the firm, wrote, adding that as much of a 30% correction was possible in the worst-case scenario.\n\nThere are a few reasons the firm sees a double-digit drop brewing:\n\nValuations are high but not excessive, given how strong corporate earnings are. Yet, tech stocks are pricey and could keep rising, Thomas Mathews, the head of markets at the firm, wrote on Monday.\n\nMathews pointed to the price-to-forward 12-month earnings ratio of the US tech sector, one measure of how highly stocks are valued. That ratio briefly rose to its highest level since the dot-com bubble last year, before easing, per Capital Economics' analysis.\n\n\"We suspect that as the rally progresses, a rise in valuations is more likely than not. Indeed, even though they are, in our view, not yet excessive, it wouldn't be surprising if investors' enthusiasm for AI tech were to push valuations to a level perhaps above what might be sustainable in the long run,\" Mathews said.\n\nWhile the backdrop for earnings is still positive, earnings growth in the S&P 500 has largely been concentrated in the tech sector, a key vulnerability to valuations.\n\n\"Admittedly, it is, perhaps, possible that a 'bubble' could emerge in expectations for earnings, rather than valuations,\" Mathews speculated.\n\n\"It's possible that rapid earnings growth at tech companies will, also, eventually come back to earth, even if that doesn't seem set to happen this year,\" he added.",

Air Canada, WestJet, and Air Transat said they would fly empty planes to Cuba to pick up passengers.\n\nThe Russian airlines are following suit.\n\nRossiya said in a follow-up statement that it was organizing at least six one-way flights from Cuban airports to Moscow, and that it would suspend all operations to the island nation by February 24.\n\nBoth Rossiya and Nordwind said they were offering refunds to affected passengers.\n\n\"Both parties are exploring alternative options to resume flights in both directions in the interests of citizens of both countries,\" Rosaviatsia wrote.\n\nCuba has long been considered a close ally of Moscow and a stronghold of Soviet and Russian influence in Latin America.\n\nRussia, isolated by international sanctions for its war against Ukraine, has recently sought to expand economic and trade ties with Cuba, encouraging Russian companies in banking, agriculture, IT, and other industries to begin operations on the island.\n\nIn September, Ukrainian intelligence officials said that the Kremlin recruited over 20,000 Cuban citizens as mercenaries to fight Kyiv's forces, with the island ranking among the top suppliers of foreign fighters.\n\nTrump said earlier this month that his administration was in discussions with Cuba as he ramps up pressure on the island.\n\n\"I think we're going to make a deal with Cuba,\" he told reporters.\n\nRussia is not the only one to chafe at Cuba's situation. On Tuesday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said at a press briefing that Beijing \"stands firmly against the inhumane actions that deprive the Cuban people of their right to subsistence and development.\"\n\n\"China will, as always, do our best to provide support and assistance to Cuba,\" said spokesperson Lin Jian.",

Here’s a look at the ice situation on the largest freshwater lake in the world, by surface area.\n\nYes, Lake Superior is the largest freshwater lake in the world if we use surface area as the criterion for size. Lake Superior’s surface area is 31,000 square miles.\n\nLake Superior takes up just slightly less area than the state of Indiana, which is around 35,000 square miles.\n\nIn the past week, Lake Superior’s ice cover grew from 34 percent coverage to 52 percent covered with ice.\n\nThe high resolution satellite image shows our massive Great Lake with a much smaller area without ice. Unfortunately, we very rarely get an entirely clear sky at this time of year for a great look at the ice.\n\nOne visual we definitely get, aside from growing ice, is the reduced lake-effect clouds. In the image above, you can see that the ice-covered west and east ends of Lake Superior don’t have lake-effect clouds forming over them.\n\nThe growth of ice in the past week added 6,000 square miles of ice to Lake Superior. That’s about the size of Connecticut.\n\nWhile satellites are an okay way to look at ice cover, a more accurate map is the human/digital combination of an ice map.\n\nThe entire Great Lakes system is now 52 percent covered with ice.\n\nLake Huron is 71 percent ice covered, and Lake Erie is 94 percent ice covered.\n\nWith the warm pattern developing this weekend into next week, the Great Lakes may have reached peak ice coverage for the winter.

    "fullText": "Investigators said one immigration enforcement official got away with physically assaulting his girlfriend for years. Another admitted he repeatedly sexually abused a woman in his custody. A third is charged with taking bribes to remove detention orders on people targeted for deportation.\n\nAt least two dozen U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees and contractors have been charged with crimes since 2020, and their documented wrongdoing includes patterns of physical and sexual abuse, corruption and other abuses of authority, a review by The Associated Press found.\n\nWhile most of the cases happened before Congress voted last year to give ICE $75 billion to hire more agents and detain more people, experts say these kinds of crimes could accelerate given the sheer volume of new employees and their empowerment to use aggressive tactics to arrest and deport people.\n\nThe Trump administration has emboldened agents by arguing they have “absolute immunity” for their actions on duty and by weakening oversight. One judge recently suggested that ICE was developing a troubling culture of lawlessness, while experts have questioned whether job applicants are getting enough vetting and training.\n\n“Once a person is hired, brought on, goes through the training and they are not the right person, it is difficult to get rid of them and there will be a price to be paid later down the road by everyone,” said Gil Kerlikowske, who served as commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection from 2014 to 2017.\n\nAlmost every law enforcement agency contends with bad employees and crimes related to domestic violence and substance abuse are long-standing problems in the field. But ICE's rapid growth and mission to deport millions are unprecedented, and the AP review found that the immense power that officers exercise over vulnerable populations can lead to abuses.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said that wrongdoing was not widespread in the agency, and that ICE “takes allegations of misconduct by its employees extremely seriously.” She said that most new hires had already worked for other law enforcement agencies, and that their backgrounds were thoroughly vetted.\n\n“America can be proud of the professionalism our officers bring to the job day-in and day-out,” she said.\n\nICE announced last month that it had more than doubled in size to 22,000 employees in less than one year.\n\nKerlikowske said ICE agents are particularly “vulnerable to unnecessary use of force issues,” given that they often conduct enforcement operations in public while facing protests. With the number of ICE detainees nearly doubling since last year to 70,000, employees and contractors responsible for overseeing them are also facing challenging conditions that can provide more opportunities for misconduct.\n\nThe Border Patrol doubled in size to more than 20,000 agents from 2004 to 2011 — six years longer than ICE took. It was embarrassed by a wave of corruption, abuse and other misconduct by some of the new hires. Kerlikowske recalled cases of agents who accepted bribes to let cars carrying drugs enter the U.S. or who became involved in human trafficking.\n\nHe and others say ICE is poised to see similar problems that will likely be broader in scope, with less oversight and accountability.\n\n“The corruption and the abuse and the misconduct was largely confined in the prior instance to along the border and interactions with immigrants and border state residents. With ICE, this is going to be a countrywide phenomenon as they pull in so many people who are attracted to this mission,” said David Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.\n\nBier, who has helped publicize some of the recent arrests and other alleged misconduct by ICE agents, said he has been struck by the “remarkable array of different offenses and charges that we’ve seen.”\n\nAP’s review examined public records involving cases of ICE employees and contractors who have been arrested since 2020, including at least 17 who have been convicted and six others who are awaiting trial. Nine have been charged in the last year, including an agent cited last month for assaulting a protester near Chicago while off-duty.\n\nSome of the most serious crimes were committed by veteran ICE employees and supervisors rather than rookies.\n\nWhile federal officials have justified ICE's aggression, the behavior of agents is drawing scrutiny from cellphone-wielding observers and prosecutors in Democratic-led jurisdictions. Local agencies are looking into last month’s fatal shootings in Minneapolis of protesters Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents, as well as the killing of Keith Porter by an off-duty ICE agent in Los Angeles on New Year’s Eve.\n\nAround the country, the cases have attracted unwelcome headlines for ICE, which has spent millions of dollars publicizing the criminal rap sheets of those they arrest as the “worst of the worst.”\n\n__ The assistant ICE field office supervisor in Cincinnati, Samuel Saxon, a 20-year ICE veteran, has been jailed since his arrest in December on charges that he attempted to strangle his girlfriend.\n\nSaxon had abused the woman for years, fracturing her hip and nose and causing internal bleeding, a judge found in a ruling ordering him detained pending trial. “The defendant is a volatile and violent individual,” the judge wrote of Saxon, whose attorneys didn’t return a message seeking comment. ICE said he is considered absent without leave.\n\n__ “I’m ICE, boys,” an ICE employment eligibility auditor told police in Minnesota in November when he was arrested in a sting as he went to meet a person he thought was a 17-year-old prostitute. Alexander Back, 41, has pleaded not guilty to attempted enticement of a minor. ICE said Back is on administrative leave while the agency investigates.\n\n—When officers in suburban Chicago found a man passed out in a crashed car in October, they were surprised to discover the driver was an ICE officer who had recently completed his shift at a detention center and had his government firearm in the vehicle. They arrested Guillermo Diaz-Torres for driving under the influence. He's pleaded not guilty and has been put on administrative duty pending an investigation.\n\n__ After an ICE officer in Florida was stopped for driving drunk with his two children in the car in August, he tried to get out of charges by pointing to his law enforcement and military service. When that failed, he demanded to know whether one of the deputies arresting him was Haitian and threatened to check the man’s immigration status, body camera video shows.\n\n“I’ll run him once I get out of here and if he’s not legit, ooh, he’s taking a ride back to Haiti,” Scott Deiseroth warned during the arrest.\n\nDeiseroth, who was sentenced to probation and community service, is on administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal investigation. “He did something stupid. He owned up to it,” said his attorney, Michael Catalano. “He’s very sorry about the whole thing.”\n\nThe AP's review found a pattern of charges involving ICE employees and contractors who mistreated vulnerable people in their care.\n\nA former top official at an ICE contract facility in Texas was sentenced to probation on Feb. 4 after acknowledging he grabbed a handcuffed detainee by the neck and slammed him into a wall last year. Prosecutors had downgraded the charge from a felony to a misdemeanor.\n\nIn December, an ICE contractor pleaded guilty to sexually abusing a detainee at a detention facility in Louisiana. Prosecutors said the man had sexual encounters with a Nicaraguan national over a five-month period in 2025 as he instructed other detainees to act as lookouts.\n\nOutside Chicago, an off-duty ICE agent has been charged with misdemeanor battery for throwing to the ground a 68-year-old protester who was filming him at a gas station in December. McLaughlin has said the agent acted in self-defense.\n\nAnother pattern that emerged in AP's review involved ICE officials charged with abusing their power for financial gain.\n\nAn ICE deportation officer in Houston was indicted last summer on charges that he repeatedly accepted cash bribes from bail bondsmen in exchange for removing detainers ICE had placed on their clients targeting them for deportation.\n\nICE said the officer was “indefinitely suspended” in May 2024, before his arrest one year later. He has pleaded not guilty to seven counts of accepting bribes and was released from custody while awaiting trial.\n\nProsecutors say a former supervisor in ICE’s New York City office provided confidential information about people’s immigration statuses to acquaintances and made an arrest in exchange for gifts and other gain. He was arrested in November 2024, has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial.\n\nTwo Utah-based ICE investigators were sentenced to prison last year for a scheme in which they made hundreds of thousands of dollars stealing synthetic drugs known as “bath salts” from government custody and selling them through government informants.\n\nThe wrongdoing often included the use of ICE resources and credentials to try to avoid arrest or receive favorable treatment.\n\nIn 2022, ICE supervisor Koby Williams was arrested in a sting by police in Othello, Washington, while going to a hotel room to meet who he thought was a 13-year-old girl he’d arranged to pay for sex.\n\nWilliams had driven his government vehicle, which was filled with cash, alcohol, pills and Viagra, and was carrying his ICE badge and loaded government firearm. The 22-year ICE veteran offered a rationale that turned out to be a lie: that he was there to “rescue” the girl as part of a human trafficking investigation. Williams is serving prison time for what prosecutors called a “reprehensible\" abuse of power.\n\n“With a duty to protect and serve,” they wrote, “defendant sought to exploit and victimize.”",

    "fullText": "The president appeared to experience a system malfunction during a self-indulgent speech at the White House on Wednesday.\n\nDonald Trump, 79, drew attention to his declining health with a confounding word salad at an event celebrating him as the “Undisputed Champion of Coal.”\n\n“I’m proud to officially name the undispuut...” Trump said, before muttering unintelligible gibberish for about two seconds.\n\n“When did this come out? Mr. Speaker,” he said, before appearing to remember his lines and getting back on track. “The undisputed champion of beautiful, clean coal.”\n\n“We have to proceed, always—don’t use the word coal, you know, it needs a PR job,\" he added.\n\nThe strange slip-up generated buzz almost immediately on social media, with internet users, including Trump’s former opponent Kamala Harris, commenting on the president’s supposedly diminishing mental faculties.\n\n“Trump, slurring: I’m proud to officially name the...undishpu...the...jshhhh...whendidthiscomeout,” wrote the Headquarters account, which is operated by Harris’ team.\n\nTrump’s trolling rival, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, couldn’t miss an opportunity to slam the president, with his press office posting the footage on X. “The sundowning starts earlier every day,” the caption read.\n\nWhen contacted by the Daily Beast for comment, White House Spokesman Davis Ingle said, “President Trump is the sharpest, most accessible, and energetic president in American history. While the deranged and failing Daily Beast has their lightweight, glue-sniffing interns push baseless conspiracy theories — President Trump spent the day unleashing energy dominance, lowering costs, and putting the American people first.”\n\nAlso, during the appearance, as the president was speaking about the benefits of coal-based energy, he took a tangent to one of his favorite topics: windmills.\n\n“I’m not a big fan of those crazy windmills,” Trump said, mimicking a windmill’s circular motion with his finger. “They’re made in China but not used by China. Let’s look for a couple of wind farms in China. See if you can find one.”\n\nChina is the undisputed leader in wind and solar power, according to The Guardian, with nearly twice as much renewable energy under construction as the rest of the world combined.\n\nHe called the inanimate objects “losers” before saying, “You’re supposed to make money with energy, not lose money with energy.”\n\nAside from his speech slip-ups, the president’s right hand also appeared discolored again, as the Daily Beast has reported extensively.\n\nTrump’s health has been in decline for months, from cankle appearances to awkward descents down the stairs of Air Force One; the president is now repeatedly finding himself having to defend his multiple gaffes.\n\nFollowing his speech, the president was presented with a trophy of a golden miner by the Washington Coal Club, which designated him as the “Undisputed Champion of Coal.”",

    "description": "Khan Academy CEO Salman Khan predicts the AI revolution will hit the U.S. faster and harder than anyone is anticipating.",
    "fullText": "In 1997 IBM supercomputer Deep Blue defeated the reigning world chess champion Garry Kasparov. In 2023 ChatGPT passed the bar exam. And last year, Google DeepMind clinched gold at the International Mathematical Olympiad.\n\nThese milestones are only expected to accelerate, with some business leaders, including SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, predicting artificial general intelligence—AI that is able to meet or surpass human intelligence—could arrive as early as this year. While avid sci-fi fans and business leaders are thrilled by the technology’s potential, others caution about the economic downsides.\n\nWhat early warning signs indicate AI workforce disruption?\n\nHow could AI cause a 10% white-collar job disruption?\n\nHow could corporate reskilling programs address AI unemployment?\n\nWhat industries face the greatest AI displacement risks?\n\nSalman Khan, CEO of Khan Academy and vision steward at TED—two organizations that provide free online education services for more than 200 million users globally—predicts the AI revolution will hit harder and faster than most are predicting (although the AI doomers are getting louder in early 2026). And while AI experts like Geoffrey Hinton, the British-Canadian computer scientist widely known as the “godfather of AI,” have warned the technology could trigger mass unemployment, Khan said even a 10% decrease could bring the burn.\n\n“If white-collar work were to shrink even 10%,” Khan told Fortune, “it’s going to feel like a depression.”\n\nBut Khan said to look beyond the ensuing AI encroachment on white-collar jobs triggering mass unemployment a bit—it could also cause an identity crisis among a large portion of the population. “They’ve been making upper-middle-class, affluent salaries for the last 20 years,” Khan said. “Their identity is tied to this. And now, all of a sudden, you’re going to have this mass shift in the job market.”\n\nWhile no one can say exactly how significantly AI will disrupt the labor market—if at all—recent research predicts an uptick in unemployment thanks to the technology. A 2025 MIT study found AI could replace nearly 12% of the U.S. workforce, nearly triple the current rate.\n\nPart of Khan’s concern stems from conversations he’s shared with business leaders within the tech industry. “People behind closed doors are talking about pretty bold things these days,” he said. “I’ve heard people say you could do the same work with a quarter of the team.”\n\nIt’s not just white-collar jobs that will be impacted. Khan predicts robotic automation has already set in motion a displacement among the gig economy. From Waymo to Tesla, driverless cars are popping up across the U.S. While adoption is still uneven, Khan predicts driverless cars will become the norm, potentially impacting more than 1 million rideshare drivers across the country.",

    "description": "A Purdue faculty group calls for Provost Patrick Wolfe's resignation, citing over a dozen issues including alleged bans on international students, DEI program cuts, and hiring freezes.",
    "fullText": "WEST LAFAYETTE, IN — A group of Purdue faculty is calling for the resignation of the university’s provost, pointing to more than a dozen issues they say have caused students and staff to “suffer.”\n\nThe Purdue chapter of American Association of University Professors, an advocacy group that represents the faculty and has been at the forefront of criticizing the university’s administration, wrote in an open letter in January that Provost Patrick Wolfe has undertaken “unilateral decision-making” since his appointment in 2023.\n\nWolfe’s policies, the faculty said, have “negatively impacted” Purdue.\n\n“Boilermakers across campus have lost confidence in Provost Wolfe’s leadership and have been unable to get Provost Wolfe to course-correct through internal channels,” they wrote in the letter, which was first obtained by Based in Lafayette on Tuesday. “Our ethical and professional obligations to Purdue and to the state of Indiana require us to speak up in order to protect the community we hold dear.”\n\nThe letter points to a number of issues that the faculty say warrant Wolfe’s resignation, including reports that Purdue administrators have effectively banned graduate students from China and other countries.\n\nIn December, a host of faculty told the Journal & Courier that departmental admissions committees were quietly pressured by university leadership to end admission for students of certain nationalities. The de facto policy change, they said, was passed off as an “unwritten” policy disseminated through in-person meetings and private conversations.\n\n“The Purdue administration attempted to do this quietly through in-person meetings, private conversations, and pressure on graduate admissions committees following a March inquiry from the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party,” the AAUP said in its January letter. “Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 establishes country of origin as a protected class.”\n\nWolfe has denied that such a ban exists.\n\nThe group also alleges that Wolfe, along with other Purdue administrators, has pressured faculty into “self-censorship,” scaring them out of researching or teaching controversial topics for fear of “being fired.”\n\nThe elimination of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives at Purdue last year, the faculty say, has also resulted in the firing of 60 student staff members and many full-time employees.\n\n“Provost Wolfe did not adequately justify these firings, which were made over the summer in an apparent attempt to evade notice,” the letter reads. “These actions, which have sent shockwaves across campus, are at odds with Purdue’s ‘people first’ mantra.”\n\nOther apparent issues the AAUP pointed to include:\n\nHalts on the hiring of new faculty, with Wolfe reportedly refusing to sign employment offers for new professors. The group says this has resulted in high turnover and teaching shortages in several departments.\n\nA “non-transparent” restructuring of Purdue’s Honors College late last year that resulted in as many as 17 professors losing employment.\n\nAn unfilled dean position in the College of Education, which has sat without leadership for three years, as well as in Purdue Libraries.\n\n“Broad overreach during tenure & promotion processes,” with the faculty saying new tenure requirements have left tenure virtually unattainable for many professors. The group also points to supposed pressure from university administrators on faculty to withdraw themselves from tenure consideration.\n\nA supposed lack of pushback from Purdue administrators against the U.S. Department of Education after the agency cancelled a $34.9 million grant to the university last year.\n\n“A lack of leadership on social and political issues that directly impact Purdue’s ability to meet its teaching, research, and service mission,” including a policy of institutional neutrality during “attacks on higher education.”\n\n“Provost Wolfe’s conduct has negatively impacted the careers of faculty and staff who are here to serve the student population, with devastating consequences for student learning and campus governance,” the faculty said in their letter. “His resignation is urgently needed in order to restore faith that the Purdue administration will treat its community with appropriate fairness and transparency and demonstrate a sense of duty to its alumni, faculty, staff and students.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Lafayette Journal & Courier: Purdue faculty group demands provost's resignation",

    "description": "As a ULA Vulcan bolted into the early Thursday skies over Cape Canaveral, many witnessed a solid rocket booster issue.",
    "fullText": "A sustained rumble shook the Space Coast early Feb. 12 as a United Launch Alliance Vulcan rocket took to the sky above Cape Canaveral but what many noticed was the unexpected light show coming from the rocket.\n\nAfter an initial delay, the Vulcan bolted into the sky at 4:22 a.m. Thursday from Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Shortly after liftoff, sparks appeared briefly from the area of the solid rocket boosters.\n\nThe rocket zoomed upward and east under the power of two core BE-4 engines and four side mounted solid rocket boosters. Then just two and a half minutes into the flight, those four solid engines detached from the rocket's core stage, appearing as four little points of light falling away from the rocket.\n\nFLORIDA TODAY photographers observed a flash and sparks coming from the rocket shortly into flight. United Launch Alliance said there was \"an observation\" its team was studying, but it had no impact on the mission being deployed correctly into orbit.\n\n\"We had an observation early during flight on one of the four solid rocket motors, the team is currently reviewing the data. The booster, upper stage, and spacecraft continued to perform on a nominal trajectory,\" a Feb. 12 update from United Launch Alliance read.\n\nVulcan had experienced a solid rocket booster mishap before. On its Oct. 2024 test flight, the Vulcan experienced an issue inside the nozzle on the booster, with many witnessing a brief spark coming from the side of the rocket. That payload made it to orbit on that flight without any problems, as well.\n\n“The integrated U.S. government and contractor team is reviewing the technical data, available imagery, and establishing a recovery team to collect any debris. We will conduct a thorough investigation, identify root cause, and implement any corrective action necessary before the next Vulcan mission,\" Gary Wentz, ULA vice president of Atlas and Vulcan Programs said in an update to the media.\n\nKnown as USSF-87, the Feb. 12 mission was called a Space Force “neighborhood watch” over geostationary orbit, which are satellites orbiting at the same direction and speed as the Earth.\n\nUSSF-87 is a Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program (GSSAP) spacecraft developed by Northrop Grumman, which is designed to boost the Space Force’s ability to quickly spot, assess, and attribute disruptions impacting geosynchronous orbit spacecraft. This includes identifying the potential threat of satellite collisions.\n\nULA said this spacecraft was the heaviest Vulcan payload flown to date. It was estimated that it was going to take approximately 10 hours to deliver the payload to its destination following launch.\n\nWhen is the next Florida launch? Is there a launch today? Upcoming NASA, SpaceX, ULA launch schedule in Florida\n\nDuring a Feb. 10 press briefing, company officials said they are expecting an increase in launch cadence this year. While ULA launched a total of six times last year — five Atlas V rockets and one Vulcan — the company plans more launches from the Cape, as well as a debut Vulcan launch from California. These missions will range from national security to Amazon Leo internet satellites.\n\n“We’re well positioned for the future,” said interim CEO John Elbon.\n\nElbon has served as interim CEO since Tory Bruno’s departure from the company in Dec. 2025 to head Blue Origin’s National Security program. Elbon had a previous career at partner Boeing and has currently been with ULA for eight years.\n\nThe next ULA mission is not currently on the Cape launch schedule, but it is anticipated to be the launch of a batch of Amazon Leo (formerly known as Project Kuiper) internet satellites atop another Vulcan rocket.\n\nThe next launch from Cape Canaveral could take place as soon as 5:15 a.m. Friday, Feb. 13 from Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. SpaceX is poised to launch NASA's next astronaut crew, referred to as Crew-12, to the International Space Station atop a Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nThe launch was originally set to occur earlier in the week, but was delayed due to weather along the northern flight path, which must be clear in case of an abort. While weather is expected to be low risk at the launch pad, ascent path weather is still forecasted to be moderate on Feb. 13. The conditions along the ascent path and Cape are forecasted to deteriorate over the next 72 hours, according to the Space Force 45th Weather Squadron.\n\nThe FLORIDA TODAY Space Team will bring you the latest updates at FloridaToday.com/Space.\n\nBrooke Edwards is a Space Reporter for Florida Today.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump met privately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday and said he'd insisted that negotiations with Iran continue as the U.S. pushes for a nuclear deal with Tehran.\n\nNetanyahu spent nearly three hours at the White House, but he entered and left out of the view of reporters and he and Trump didn't take questions. In a subsequent post on his social media site, however, the president called it “a very good meeting” and said “there was nothing definitive reached, other than I insisted that negotiations with Iran continue to see whether or not a Deal can be consummated.”\n\n“If it can, I let the Prime Minister know that will be a preference,” Trump wrote. “If it cannot, we will just have to see what the outcome will be.”\n\nHe added, “Last time Iran decided that they were better off not making a Deal” and were hit by U.S. airstrikes.\n\n“Hopefully this time they will be more reasonable and responsible,” Trump wrote.\n\nIn a statement, Netanyahu's office said the two leaders had discussed negotiations with Iran as well as developments in Gaza and around the region and they had “agreed to continue their close coordination and relationship.”\n\nWednesday's meeting was their seventh during Trump’s second term and took place as both the U.S. and Iran are projecting cautious optimism after holding indirect talks in Oman on Friday about how, once again, to approach negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program.\n\nTrump said on reaching an agreement with Iran in a Tuesday interview with Fox Business Network’s Larry Kudlow: “I think they’d be foolish if they didn’t. We took out their nuclear power last time, and we’ll have to see if we take out more this time.”\n\n“It’s got to be a good deal,” he said then. “No nuclear weapons, no missiles.”\n\nNetanyahu's office said prior to the meeting that he wants the U.S.-Iran talks to include limits on Tehran's ballistic missile program and its support for militant groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah.\n\n“I will present to the president our outlook regarding the principles of these negotiations — the essential principles which, in my opinion, are important not only to Israel, but to everyone around the world who wants peace and security in the Middle East,” Netanyahu said Tuesday before leaving Israel.\n\nBut it remains unclear how much influence Netanyahu will have over Trump's approach toward Iran. Trump initially threatened to take military action over Iran’s bloody crackdown on nationwide protests in January, then shifted to a pressure campaign in recent weeks to try to get Tehran to make a deal over its nuclear program.\n\nIran is still reeling from the 12-day war with Israel in June. The devastating series of airstrikes, including the U.S. bombing several Iranian nuclear sites, killed nearly 1,000 people in Iran and almost 40 in Israel.\n\nTrump has said repeatedly that U.S. strikes had “obliterated” Iran's nuclear capabilities, though the amount of damage remains unclear. Satellite photos of nuclear sites have recently captured activity, prompting concern that Iran could be attempting to salvage or assess damage at the sites.\n\nIsrael has long called for Iran to cease all uranium enrichment, dial back its ballistic missile program and cut ties to militant groups across the region. Iran has always rejected those demands, saying it would only accept some limits on its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief.\n\nWashington has built up military forces in the region, sending an aircraft carrier, guided-missile destroyers, air defense assets and more to supplement its presence. Arab and Islamic countries, including Turkey and Qatar, have been urging both sides to show restraint, warning that any strike or retaliation could have destabilizing consequences for a region already strained by the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nIn his post, Trump said he and Netanyahu had “also discussed the tremendous progress being made in Gaza, and the Region in general.”\n\nTrump plans to hold the first meeting next week of his Board of Peace, which was initially framed to oversee future steps of the U.S.-brokered Gaza ceasefire plan but has taken shape with Trump's ambitions of resolving other global crises.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Netanyahu met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio at Blair House, across the street from the White House, and agreed to be part of the board.\n\nOn Iran, Trump said Friday that his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, and son-in-law Jared Kushner had “very good” talks and more were planned this week. But the Republican president kept up the pressure, warning that if Iran did not make a deal over its nuclear program, “the consequences are very steep.”\n\nIran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, made similar comments, saying there will be consultations on “next steps.” He also said the level of mistrust between the two longtime adversaries remains a “serious challenge facing the negotiations.”\n\nHe signaled that Iran would stick to its position that it must be able to enrich uranium — a major point of contention with Trump.\n\nNetanyahu met with Witkoff and Kushner shortly after arriving in Washington on Tuesday evening and they gave him an update on the talks held with Iran in Oman, the prime minister's office said.\n\nAraghchi said in November that Iran was no longer enriching uranium due to the damage from last year’s war.\n\nBefore the war, Iran had been enriching uranium up to 60% purity, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. The U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, had said Iran was the only country in the world to enrich to that level that was not armed with the bomb.\n\nIran has been refusing requests by the IAEA to inspect the sites bombed in the June war. Even before that, Iran has restricted IAEA inspections since Trump’s decision in 2018 to unilaterally withdraw the U.S. from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.\n\nAmiri reported from New York, Weissert from Washington.",

    "fullText": "TAIPEI, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Taiwan plans to send officials to assess U.S. rare earths deposits with a goal to have such ‌minerals refined on the island, Economy Minister Kung Ming-hsin said on ‌Wednesday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration has stepped up efforts to secure U.S. supplies of critical minerals ​after China rattled senior officials and global markets last year by withholding rare earths required by American automakers and other industrial manufacturers.\n\nTrump last week launched a U.S. strategic stockpile of critical minerals, called Project Vault, backed by $10 ‌billion in seed funding from ⁠the U.S. Export-Import Bank and $2 billion in private funding.\n\nWhile semiconductor powerhouse Taiwan is not formally part of that scheme, ⁠it has previously held talks with the United States on how it can help, given Taipei's concerns about over-reliance on a China-centric supply chain.\n\nChina views Taiwan ​as ​its own territory and has stepped up ​its military threats.\n\nSpeaking to reporters ‌in Taipei, Kung said the ministry's Geological Survey and Mining Management Agency would go to the United States to assess rare earths deposits there.\n\n\"Specifically, what rare-earth elements they contain and whether they are suitable. In other words, whether those are the rare earths we actually need. So we still ‌need to investigate,\" he said.\n\nGiven Taiwan does ​not mine such elements itself, it can ​instead play a role in ​refining the materials from other countries, Kung added.\n\n\"The technology ‌is not an issue; the next ​step is scaling up,\" ​he said.\n\nTaiwan consumes 1,500 metric tonnes of rare earth annually, a figure projected to rise to 2,000 metric tonnes given economic growth, ​Kung added.\n\n\"Our goal is ‌to expand production capacity to meet half of our demand ​by then, strengthening the supply chain.\"",

    "description": "Wall Street is gearing up for an update on the Fed's favored inflation gauge after the jobs report bolstered the case against cutting rates.",
    "fullText": "US stocks turned sharply lower Thursday, as investors revived a rotation out of megacap tech stocks as they looked ahead Friday's inflation reading to guide rate-cut bets, already dampened by a strong January jobs report.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell roughly 1%, or over 500 points, after the blue-chip benchmark snapped a three-day win streak on Wednesday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 1.2%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell nearly 2%.\n\nThe mixed picture comes as investors scrutinize incoming earnings closely for clues to the sectors vulnerable to AI disruption, which spurred the recent meltdown in software stocks. Cisco Systems (CSCO) stock fell over 11% as its gloomy profit outlook overshadowed a rise in sales amid Big Tech's AI buildout.\n\nBig Tech stocks followed suit. Nvidia and Microsoft both fell over 1%, while Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) saw steeper losses.\n\nMeanwhile, attention is starting to turn to Friday’s Consumer Price Index report. A softer reading will build hopes that price pressures are easing while economic growth remains intact.\n\nBefore then, the weekly reading on jobless claims — which showed a smaller decline than expected — came in focus after nonfarm-payrolls data showed the US economy added twice as many jobs as anticipated in January. The strength in hiring complicates expectations for Fed policy. A resilient labor market, paired with sticky inflation, is seen as reducing the likelihood of near-term interest-rate cuts — a key driver of recent equity gains.\n\nElsewhere on the earnings front, McDonald’s (MCD) shares nudged higher after the burger giant's earnings beat. Looking ahead, Coinbase (COIN), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Rivian (RIVN) are highlights on Thursday's docket, all due after the market close.\n\nApple (AAPL) stock was the worst-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" stock on Thursday afternoon, dropping around 5% as part of a broad sell-off across tech.\n\nReports on Wednesday that Apple's highly anticipated upgrade to its Siri voice assistant could be delayed also weighed on shares, which are off by 4% year to date. The new Siri was intended to be launched as part of an operating system update in March, but certain features could be postponed due to issues in testing, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.\n\nThe rollout of the revamped Siri, first announced in June 2024, has been riddled with delays, putting investors on edge about Apple's artificial intelligence capabilities.\n\nSeparately, US Federal Trade Commission Chairman Andrew Ferguson said Wednesday he sent a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook, raising concerns about allegations that Apple News has been censoring content from conservative publications.\n\nMeta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Tesla (TSLA) were also down more than 2% as tech got hit. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) was the lone Magnificent Seven name in the green, up 0.4%.\n\nInflation in electricity prices has more than doubled headline PCE inflation as the AI infrastructure and data center build-out have sent power demand soaring through the US, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a client note on Wednesday.\n\nElectricity prices rose by 6.9% year over year through December 2025, the bank wrote, while PCE inflation rose 2.9% over the same period. On an annualized average basis, electricity prices rose by 6.8% since January 2022, while headline PCE inflation rose by 3.4%.\n\nThe rapid inflation in electricity prices is primarily driven by two key factors: the rapid construction of data centers, which demand enormous amounts of energy to operate, and the boom in capital investment by utility companies as they attempt to increase energy supply to meet demand, \"which will raise utility costs and therefore electricity prices.\"\n\nThe analysts also noted several bottlenecks that will prevent energy supply from catching up with demand, including strict regulations and shortages of critical hardware such as transformers and natural gas turbines.\n\n\"The combination of strong demand and sluggish supply will likely increase power prices in regional wholesale markets — where most utilities and other market participants procure electricity before delivering it to final customers,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nThough they note that the pressure will likely be \"much more acute in a few markets than the US as a whole because data centers are highly geographically concentrated,\" with \"about 1% of all US counties account[ing] for about 70% of data center capacity.\"\n\nThe largest jumps in electricity inflation are likely to be seen in \"tighter power markets\" in the Midwest, California, and Texas, the analysts wrote.\n\nThe US stock market turned into the red through late morning trading on Thursday, marking a sharp reversal from earlier gains on the major indexes.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way down, shedding roughly 1.5%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which snapped a three-day streak of gains on Wednesday, both lost roughly 1%.\n\nThe downturn comes as investors look for any signs of weakness in the earnings reports of companies vulnerable to AI disruption, which has triggered the meltdown in software stocks over the past week-and-a-half. Cisco Systems (CSCO) stock fell over 11% as its gloomy profit outlook overshadowed a rise in sales amid Big Tech's AI buildout.\n\nThe tech sector's largest names also dragged the sector down, as Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) both fell over 1% while Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) saw steeper losses.\n\nWhile investors got a bullish read on the labor market in Wednesday's nonfarm payrolls report, showing that January added twice as many jobs as expected, data published Thursday on initial jobless claims dimmed some of that optimism, showing a smaller decline than expected.\n\nOil prices fell on Thursday as investors weighed a new demand forecast from the International Energy Agency, which predicted a slowdown, and unclear progress in talks between the US and Iran.\n\nFutures on international pricing benchmark Brent crude (BZ=F) and US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CL=F) shed roughly 1.8% to trade below $68.20 and $63.50 a barrel, respectively.\n\nIn a new publication on Thursday, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said world oil demand would rise by 850,000 barrels per day (bpd) this year, 80,000 bpd lower than the agency's January forecast. The figure is also much lower than that published by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on Wednesday, which said demand would rise by 1.38 million bpd this year.\n\nThe IEA also maintained its call that the market will spend 2026 in a deep oversupply glut, which the agency pegged at 3.73 million bpd of excess oil.\n\nWhile market watchers had broadly coalesced around the likelihood of a supply glut through 2026, with prices expected to drop, oil prices have instead gained roughly 10% since the start of the year, following a series of geopolitical events, including the US takeover of Venezuela's oil industry, widespread protests in Iran, and damage to key export terminals on the Caspian Sea.\n\nIn public comments on Thursday, the CEO of commodities trading house Vitol, Russell Hardy, said the global oil market is tightening instead of loosening, especially as the US ratchets up pressure on Russia and Iran, pushing buyers to find barrels in other markets.\n\nVitol is the world's largest independent trader of oil.\n\nThe key swing factor for oil prices right now remains ongoing negotiations between the US and Iran over the Iranian regime's uranium enrichment technology. President Trump on Wednesday deployed more military craft to the region, and analysts say any military action could result in retaliation from Iran, which controls the Strait of Hormuz, a critically important global chokepoint for oil flows.\n\nAs worries around the electricity and water demand of AI data centers have taken root, federal and state lawmakers have begun pushing back, introducing bills to regulate or halt development entirely.\n\nThis week, Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) introduced the first bipartisan bill in Congress designed to prevent data center power usage from affecting consumers' electric bills.\n\nA week earlier, on Feb. 6, New York became at least the sixth state to have its legislators propose a bill to pause data center construction within state lines. This legislation would effectively shut out New York as a potential site for new data centers if it passes.\n\nIn doing so, New York's legislators join federal and state congressional leaders across the country in attempting to legislate an industry that has boomed and threatens an already overtaxed power grid.\n\n\"The regulatory framework was not designed for single-sector load shocks, so policymakers are attempting to adjust in real time to the scale and speed at which the load forecasts are changing,\" Didi Caldwell, founder and CEO of site selection advisory firm Global Location Strategies, told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"The system is ill-equipped to address the dramatic increase in demand created by AI data centers,\" she said.\n\nAnd lawmakers are trying to catch up.\n\nWednesday's unexpectedly bullish jobs report has all but shuttered the odds of rate cuts under current Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and narrowed the path to cuts under a Kevin Warsh-led Fed, Bank of America economists wrote in a client note on Thursday, calling the report \"a feast for the hawks.\"\n\nData released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday showed that the US added 130,000 jobs in January, doubling economists' expectations of 65,000. The unemployment rate also fell to 4.3% from 4.4%, beating expectations that the rate would remain flat.\n\nThe data gave lift to the argument that even as inflation has stayed elevated, the labor market is remaining resilient. These conditions are seen as reducing the odds of rate cuts in the near future.\n\n\"Payrolls surged above all expectations, the downward revisions were minimal, and wages and hours were up as well,\" the analysts wrote. \"The broad-based strength in the Jan jobs report vindicates our view that the Fed won't cut under Powell.\"\n\nFor now, the economists wrote, BofA is maintaining its prediction of two rate cuts under a Warsh-led Fed. But the swing metric for potential rate cuts under Warsh, they wrote, will be the unemployment rate.\n\n\"The key risk to his call for significant cuts is a decline in the u-rate. Therefore, the path to cuts under Warsh (which we don't think the economy needs) now looks narrower,\" the BofA economists wrote.\n\n\"If the u-rate is stable or down even further by June, Warsh might be stuck on hold for the rest of the year.\"\n\nUS stocks rose in the first minutes of trading on Thursday as investors digested the latest string of earnings reports and looked ahead to Friday's inflation reading as the next major signpost for rate-cut bets.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) picked up roughly 0.5% as trading began, after the blue-chip benchmark snapped a three-day win streak on Wednesday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) both rose around 0.3%.\n\nThursday's weekly reading on jobless claims — which showed a smaller decline than expected — offered another picture of the labor market after nonfarm-payrolls data showed the US economy added twice as many jobs as anticipated in January.\n\nOn the corporate calendar, earnings from Coinbase (COIN), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Rivian (RIVN) are due after Thursday's closing bell.\n\nThe US saw 227,000 initial jobless claims for the week ended Feb. 7, exceeding expectations and marking a decrease from the previous week's 232,000 initial claims, according to data released Thursday by the Department of Labor.\n\nEconomists had expected 223,000 claims for unemployment benefits, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nContinuing claims for the week came in at 1.86 million, also exceeding economists' estimates of 1.85 million and marking an increase over the previous week's 1.84 million continuing claims.\n\nThe Labor Department data comes after investors received a stronger-than-expected read on payroll additions in January.\n\nData released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed 130,000 jobs added in January, compared to estimates of 65,000 jobs. However, 2025 revisions knocked 400,000 job additions off the year's total, bringing the monthly average of payroll additions to roughly 15,000 per month.\n\nEuropean stocks broadly gained on Thursday as earnings results from Siemens, EssilorLuxxotica, and others lifted sentiment.\n\nGermany's DAX (^GDAXI) rose 1.3%. The index was lifted by a 6% increase in Siemens stock (SIE.DE) after the industrial company raised its 2026 earnings guidance due to strong artificial intelligence demand.\n\nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) advanced another 0.3% after hitting a record high on Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris climbed 1%. Shares of component EssilorLuxxotica (EL.PA), the maker of Ray-Ban and Oakley sunglasses, jumped more than 6% after the company sounded bullish on revenue growth from smart glasses in its earnings report. EssilorLuxxotica expanded its partnership with Meta (META) to produce the AI glasses.\n\nUS healthcare company Baxter's (BAX) stock sank 14% before the bell on Thursday following the release of its fourth quarter earnings, forecasting annual profit below Wall Street estimates. The company cited persistent problems from hurricane-related issues at one of its manufacturing plants.\n\nMagnum Ice Cream's (MICC) stock fell 12% during premarket hours on Thursday. The group, which was recently spun off from Unilever (UL) and makes popular ice creams such as Ben & Jerry's and Cornetto, reported a 3% decline in sales for its fourth quarter earnings.\n\nSanofi (SNY) stock fell 6% before the bell on Thursday after the French pharmaceutical company ousted its CEO, Paul Hudson, thanking him Thursday for \"valuable contributions\" but without giving any reason for his surprise exit.\n\nMicron (MU) stock rose 3% during premarket hours on Thursday after its CEO, brushed off concerns on Wednesday about competition growing in the memory chip space. Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) also claimed an early lead in the race to supply AI chips to Nvidia (NVDA). Samsung Electronics is a key competitor of Micron.\n\nAppLovin (APP) shares fell 5% before the bell today following the group's fourth-quarter earnings release on Wednesday, which beat Wall Street estimates. The advertising company's shares have fallen almost 30% over the past month.\n\nSome smaller pharmaceutical companies not targeted by President Trump for deals to lower their US drug pricing are looking to craft their own agreements with his administration, industry sources told Reuters. The moves are a bid to avoid potentially onerous tariffs and new price-setting schemes.\n\nCisco (CSCO) stock fell 7% during premarket hours on Thursday after the networking company issued guidance below Wall Street forecasts.\n\nFor the full year, Cisco raised its guidance for earnings per share to $3.00 to $3.08 on revenue of $61.2 billion to $61.7 billion. However, the Street was looking for earnings guidance of $3.12 on revenue of $62.1 billion.\n\nIn Cisco's second quarter, the company reported earnings per share of $0.80, compared to Wall Street analyst estimates of $0.74 per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue rose 10% year over year to $15.3 billion, compared to estimates of $15.1 billion.\n\n\"We see strong, broad-based demand for our technology solutions and remain focused on capturing the significant opportunities we see ahead,\" Cisco CFO Mark Patterson said.",

    "description": "His wife, Annie, has been a prominent face of the investigation.",
    "fullText": "Savannah Guthrie‘s brother-in-law Tomasso Cioni hasn’t been seen in a week as police search his and his wife (and Savannah’s sister) Annie Guthrie’s home as part of the investigation into the abduction of Savannah and Annie’s missing mother, Nancy Guthrie.\n\nTommaso was last photographed on February 3, two days after Nancy went missing in the middle of the night on February 1. In photos obtained by The Daily Mail, Tommaso and Annie were both photographed in their car as they arrived back to their home in the Tucson, Arizona area. Photos showed Tommaso behind the steering wheel with sunglasses on as he covered his face with his jacket. Annie was seen in the driver’s seat with her hood up, as she also covered her face.\n\nSavannah Guthrie Pleads for People to 'Recognize' Her Mom's Kidnapper After Supporters Call on Officials to Investigate Her Brother-in-Law's 'Inner Circle'\n\nHostage Rescue Team Reportedly Arrives For Savannah Guthrie's Mom Case as Sources Speculate if There 'Could Be Movement Tonight'\n\nWhile Annie has appeared in several social media videos posted by Savannah asking for help in the investigation into their mother’s disappearance, it’s understandable why Tommaso has taken a step back from the cameras after former NewsNation host Ashleigh Banfield reported that Tommaso “may be” the “prime suspect” in the investigation, which the Pima County Sheriff Department later denied.\n\n“We have not identified a suspect or person of interest in this case. Detectives continue to speak with anyone who may have had contact with Mrs. Guthrie. We are also awaiting additional forensic results,” the department said in a statement to TMZ before addressing Banfield’s claim that Annie’s car had been seized. “We are not confirming the car being seized, we are unsure where that reporter is getting that information.”\n\nAccording to The Pima County Sheriff’s Department, Annie was the last person to see Nancy before she disappeared. “We have a start point,” Sheriff Chris Nanos told Us Weekly in a report published on February 4, adding that there were no “red flags” about Nancy’s behavior before she disappeared. “The family took her home from dinner at about 9:30 to 9:45 [p.m.]. So we would back that up to even say 9 or 8:30 p.m. to start looking.”\n\nSince Nancy went missing, Tommaso and Annie’s home has been researched twice. It was first searched on February 4 before it was searched again on February 7. TMZ reported that officials were inside Annie and Tommaso’s home for several hours, photographing multiple rooms, with the site claiming that one officer was seen carrying a silver briefcase into the residence. “Update from Annie Guthrie’s house where investigators remain inside. They’ve been here for almost 3 hours,” tweeted NewsNation reporter Brian Entin, along with a video of officials searching Annie’s home.\n\nAnnie’s home is located approximately four miles from Nancy’s residence in Catalina Foothills, Arizona, where she was taken in the middle of the night on January 31. Tracy Walder, a former CIA and FBI agent told People ahead of searching Annie’s home that officials “may have either asked Annie’s permission,” obtained a search warrant or both.\n\nAccording to People, authorities, including at least one official with the Pima County’s Sheriff’s Department, searched Annie’s home from 8 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. local time. Two and a half hours into the search, an official was seen leaving Annie’s home with a white suitcase and a brown bag, while another was seen wearing blue gloves. “All that white case is — is evidence processing tools. The brown bag is for evidence,” Walder told People.\n\nAccording to The Daily Mail, police did not need Tommaso’s consent or a warrant to search the home as long as Annie allowed them access. Two US Supreme Court cases ruled that police can search a shared home, such as a marital residence, as long as one of its occupants is there and consents. If the other resident was present when police arrived to conduct a search and refused access, law enforcement officials would have to return with a warrant.\n\nThe 26 Best Romantic Comedies to Watch if You Want to Know What Love Feels Like\n\nThese ‘Bachelor’ Secrets & Rules Prove What Happens Behind the Scenes Is So Much Juicier\n\nBTS's 7 Members Were Discovered in the Most Unconventional Ways",

    "fullText": "CLAIRTON, Pa. (AP) — For Don Furko, Aug. 11, 2025, was a normal shift. Until it became the shift he would never forget.\n\nAt 10:47 a.m., U.S. Steel’s Clairton Coke Works outside Pittsburgh — a sprawling riverside industrial facility and the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere — erupted in an ear-piercing boom.\n\nA steelworker for 25 years and former Clairton local union president, Furko pulled on flame-retardant jacket and pants, a hard hat and safety glasses, left his post and rushed to the black plume of smoke rising from the facility’s batteries — the massive arrangements of industrial ovens that heat coal to some 2,000 degrees, turning it into carbon-rich coke.\n\nNear the wharf, Renee Hough, a utility technician in charge of loading coke, sat in the cab of the plant’s screening station when the explosion ripped through the air, blinding her in black dust. “My first thought was I was dead,” Hough recalls. Flames emerged as the dust settled, and a voice crackled through the radio: Battery 13 had just exploded.\n\n“I can’t even explain how mangled everything was,” Furko recalls. “There were flames everywhere.” Workers shuttled the injured to the helipad for evacuation. Through the chaos, Furko heard a fellow steelworker screaming, buried beneath the rubble.\n\nThis story is a collaboration between Pittsburgh’s Public Source and The Associated Press.\n\nThe blast killed two U.S. Steel workers and injured 11 others, including contractors, according to the Chemical Safety Board, a federal agency investigating the incident.\n\nSix months later, workers remain rattled and community concerns about air pollution from the plant are heightened.\n\nThe blast comes on top of a string of other accidents at the Clairton plant over time as well as a long history of legal battles between U.S. Steel and Allegheny County regulators, who regularly accuse the company of flouting environmental rules at the facility. As recently as Jan. 27, pollution control equipment at the Clairton plant temporarily broke down and nearby air monitors recorded elevated air pollution, according to the Allegheny County Health Department.\n\nTo U.S. Steel’s critics, the August blast highlighted chronic problems at the facility. And some current and former workers at Clairton Coke Works say poor management and underinvestment have exacerbated air pollution and undermined workplace safety at the plant where operators already have little margin for error, Pittsburgh’s Public Source and The Associated Press have found.\n\nThe August explosion also came after Nippon Steel’s $15 billion acquisition of U.S. Steel in June 2025. It’s an open question whether the Japanese steel company will invest significantly in Clairton Coke Works and address issues raised by workers, government officials and environmental watchdogs.\n\nThe Chemical Safety Board has said that the August explosion occurred while workers were preparing to replace a damaged valve that was detected in July, as well as other valves. The agency’s investigation continues; it said in December that it has identified “potentially unmitigated hazards for workers at Clairton Coke Works that warrant immediate attention.”\n\n“They try to say ‘safety first, safety first,’” said Brian Pavlack, a current worker at Clairton Coke Works. “Safety is not the first priority for them.”\n\nNippon Steel did not provide a response to written questions. In a written statement responding to detailed questions, U.S. Steel stressed its commitment to safety.\n\n“Safety is our core value and shapes our culture, influences how we lead, and anchors our responsibility to ensure that every employee returns home safely, every single day,” the company said.\n\nThe 392-acre Clairton Coke Works opened more than a century ago, 20 miles south of Pittsburgh along the west bank of the Monongahela River. The ovens at the plant heat coal at high temperatures for hours to make coke, a key component in steelmaking. Its ovens produce 3.6 million tons of coke annually, which is shipped to the company’s operations farther up the river at the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock, and to U.S. Steel’s Gary Works in Indiana.\n\nBut making coke isn’t a clean process or without risk. The heat removes impurities, producing a flammable byproduct called coke oven gas. Coke oven gas includes hydrogen, methane, nitrogen and carbon monoxide, and some of it is used as fuel to heat the coke ovens. Coke oven gas is explosive due to high hydrogen content, said Fred Rorick, a former operations manager at Bethlehem Steel and steel industry consultant.\n\n“At a coke works, when you have that, you have to be very, very, very careful,” Rorick said.\n\nAccording to the Chemical Safety Board, the August explosion happened while workers were closing and opening a gas isolation valve in a basement after pumping water into the valve. U.S. Steel’s written procedure did not mention the use of water and a U.S. Steel supervisor directed workers to pump the water, the agency said. Kurt Barshick, U.S. Steel’s vice president of the Mon Valley Works, said during an October presentation to residents in the wake of the August explosion that workers trapped “3,000 PSI water inside of a valve that’s rated for 50 PSI.” The valve cracked and gas filled the area, Barshick added.\n\nDrew Sahli, the Chemical Safety Board’s investigator in charge, said there was a “release of coke oven gas” and that the gas “contacted an ignition source” and exploded. The agency is still investigating how the gas was released, Sahli said.\n\nU.S. Steel said it has “strengthened several safety protocols” based on its own ongoing investigation, including prohibiting the use of high-pressure water for valve cleaning and reviewing their “Management of Change program, which assesses proposed changes in procedures and evaluates risk.”\n\nBefore the August blast, Clairton Coke Works already had a history of accidents and explosions.\n\n—In 2009, a maintenance worker was killed in a blast.\n\n—In 2010, an explosion injured 14 employees and six contractors.\n\n—In 2014, a worker was burned and died after falling into a trench.\n\n—In February 2025, a problem at a battery led to a “buildup of combustible material” that ignited, injuring two people, according to the Allegheny County Health Department.\n\nAfter the 2010 explosion, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined U.S. Steel and a subcontractor $175,000 for safety violations. U.S. Steel appealed its citations and fines, which were later reduced to $78,500 under a settlement agreement. U.S. Steel admitted no wrongdoing as part of the settlement.\n\nWhile there’s “a lot of ways that you can get yourself hurt or killed” at Clairton Coke Works, explosions are the biggest hazard, said Calvin Croftcheck, who previously worked at the plant and served as the United Steelworkers safety coordinator for U.S. Steel.\n\n“Since 2009, there have been three accidents that have resulted in fatalities and that is just not common in today’s age of safety,” said Phillip Kondrot, a workers’ compensation attorney who represents workers injured at Clairton Coke Works. “That is a dangerous place to work.”\n\n“We have intensive procedures that are currently in place at Clairton and our other facilities, and our employees are charged with following them,” U.S. Steel said. “We will not respond to comments from for-profit lawyers and stand behind the safety professionals who tirelessly work at U. S. Steel.”\n\nSome current and former workers at the Clairton plant fault U.S. Steel’s management of the aging facility, saying that it has caused a range of operational problems.\n\n“A lot of things that have happened there, where they needed something fixed and something went wrong, it was because corporate wouldn’t approve them ordering the parts,” said Jonathan Ledwich, who worked at Clairton Coke Works between 2011 and 2022 trying to prevent emission leaks from the coke ovens. “We did the best we could with what we had.”\n\nLedwich points to a fire at the Clairton plant on Christmas Eve 2018. It shut down pollution control equipment and led to repeated releases of sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, according to a lawsuit filed by environmental groups after the incident. In the wake of the fire, Allegheny County warned residents to limit outdoor activities, with residents saying for weeks afterward that the air smelled like rotten eggs and was hard to breathe.\n\nRanajit Sahu, an engineer hired by the plaintiffs, wrote in a report filed in the case that he found “no indication” that U.S. Steel “has an effective, comprehensive maintenance program for the Clairton plant.” Sahu also wrote that the 2018 accident, which was precipitated by piping falling due to corrosion, was “preventable by a robust inspection and preventive maintenance program and by better plant design.”\n\nIn a 2024 consent decree settling the lawsuit, U.S. Steel agreed to measures including investing close to $20 million in facility upgrades and permanently idling a battery of coke ovens at the plant. As part of the consent decree, U.S. Steel admitted no liability.\n\nHough, the utility technician in charge of loading coke, said that the lack of proactive maintenance at Clairton Coke Works makes her feel unsafe at times.\n\n“There’s a lot of things that need to be repaired that they’re not prioritizing because you can’t stop production,” Hough said of U.S. Steel.\n\nSome current and former plant workers also describe difficulty getting coke oven doors replaced. Ledwich, the former Clairton steel worker, said some doors that needed to be replaced would leak emissions.\n\nIn a 2020 deposition for the lawsuit related to the 2018 Christmas Eve fire, James Kelly, former deputy director of the environmental health bureau at the Allegheny County Health Department – the agency that oversees emissions at the plant – said the facility is “one of the most decrepit facilities” that he’d ever seen.\n\nThe litigation surrounding the Christmas Eve fire wasn’t the first time U.S. Steel was accused in court of skimping on maintenance. In a 2017 amended federal class action lawsuit alleging violations of federal securities laws, U.S. Steel shareholders said that the company CEO hired the consulting firm McKinsey & Company in 2014 after multiple unprofitable years and “implemented extreme cost-cutting measures” in 2015 involving layoffs and deferrals of “desperately-needed maintenance and repairs.” The lawsuit was eventually settled and the U.S. Steel defendants admitted no wrongdoing.\n\nU.S. Steel had “one of the best safety staffs in the country,” said Mike Wright, former director of the health, safety, and environment department at the United Steelworkers. But key safety department leaders were fired, according to Wright and Croftcheck, the former union safety coordinator. Wright said the dismissals occurred in 2016.\n\nEd Mazurkiewicz, former director of safety and industrial hygiene at U.S. Steel, said that he was let go by the company in 2016. While he knew at the time that McKinsey had been “evaluating all of U.S. Steel” and that there would be downsizing, it was still a shock when his job was eliminated, Mazurkiewicz said.\n\nU.S. Steel said it has “worked with many advisers and partners” over the years and that the company’s “overall transformation efforts have improved our company’s performance, created a robust maintenance program, and improved employee safety over time.” In response to questions about U.S. Steel’s safety department and the firing of department leaders, the company said: “We cannot comment on personnel matters.”\n\n“They brought in McKinsey to tell them really how to run things,” Wright said of U.S. Steel. “We were a little outraged by that.”\n\nMcKinsey said in a statement that the company is one of “many advisers that have served U.S. Steel in support of its efforts to keep manufacturing jobs in the United States, improve operational resiliency, and invest in and support the communities in which it operates.”\n\n“As with all our work for the company – and with all our clients – safety is always a top priority,” the company added.\n\nMaintenance practices have changed over time, some current and former workers say.\n\n“I used to see a lot more maintenance and taking care of things and fixing things before they broke, or replacing things that were worn out,” said Hough, who has worked at the plant for 29 years. “That used to happen back when I was first hired there, and that hasn’t happened in the last 10 or so years.”\n\nFor years, Clairton Coke Works has drawn the ire of government regulators, environmental advocates and community members concerned about air pollution originating from the plant. Air quality in the region has improved over time, but the Clairton plant has been the largest local source of air pollution – such as sulfur oxides and particulate matter – in recent years, according to the Allegheny County Health Department. Particulate matter, for instance, is linked to various health issues, including heart attacks and aggravated asthma. The plant also emits carcinogenic benzene.\n\nWhile the Clairton plant is allowed to emit some air pollution, county Health Department regulators routinely clash with U.S. Steel over alleged violations of the plant’s operating permit, such as excessive emissions or failing to use pollution control equipment. In 2023, for instance, the Allegheny County Health Department fined U.S. Steel more than $2 million for violations at Clairton Coke Works.\n\n“You’re sort of in this cycle of patching, monitoring, fining, patching, monitoring, fining, and it’s never really good enough,” said Karen Hacker, director of the Allegheny County Health Department between 2013 and 2019. “You can’t say it hasn’t improved. Just look at the sky in Pittsburgh, right? But it hasn’t removed a source of pollution.”\n\nIn response to questions from Public Source and AP, the Allegheny County Health Department said in a written statement that the agency “inspects coking operations daily” and “addresses violations as discovered during inspections” with a full compliance evaluation every two years.\n\nThe department also said that air monitoring stations near the Clairton plant “have measured a 15-25% reduction in annual average particle pollution concentrations compared to ten years ago.” The department declined to comment on “open investigations, enforcement orders, or pending litigation.”\n\nNationally, Clairton Coke Works’ environmental compliance track record is an outlier, according to a Public Source and AP analysis of federal Clean Air Act data from about 14,000 facilities. The analysis found that Clairton Coke Works is classified by the EPA as a “high-priority violator” – only about 11% of major emitters fall into that category. It’s even rarer for facilities to garner financial penalties on the magnitude that Clairton Coke Works has faced in the last five years, the analysis shows. Just 11 facilities, including Clairton Coke Works, have faced $10 million in penalties or \n\n“It’s a massive facility. It’s a complex facility and it’s an underfunded facility,” said Adam Ortiz, former EPA regional administrator of the Mid-Atlantic region during the Biden administration. “All those things make it tough.”\n\nU.S. Steel said in its statement that the company spends “$100 million annually on environmental compliance at Clairton alone and has consistently achieved an environmental compliance rate exceeding 99% for regulated activities per year at our Clairton Plant, the largest cokemaking facility in North America.”\n\nThe company said that it has “invested more than $750 million in environmental improvement projects in the Mon Valley” and that preliminary data shows that a county air monitor located downwind of the Clairton plant has met the Environmental Protection Agency’s national ambient air quality standard for particulate matter since 2024.\n\n“Our steadfast pursuit of environmental excellence will continue,” the company said. “We maintain a productive relationship with the ACHD and other regulators, with a commitment to regulation grounded in science and law.”\n\nSome environmental advocates have argued that the Allegheny County Health Department is outgunned against U.S. Steel. The department’s air quality program, which handles oversight of Clairton Coke Works, is funded by fees paid by industrial polluters. But the program has struggled financially in recent years. In a 2018 report, the EPA asserted that revenue from emissions-based fees was “diminishing as a result of emissions reductions” and that the existing fee structure could potentially “undermine long-term program sustainability.” The Allegheny County Council approved raising the fees in 2021 and again in November.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration has signaled that it is taking a more hands-off approach with polluters. In November, President Donald Trump temporarily exempted Clairton Coke Works and other coking plants from provisions of a Biden-era rule that, for instance, required fenceline monitoring for benzene emissions. U.S. Steel previously requested an exemption.\n\nU.S. Steel said that the rule “imposed significant compliance costs while setting technically unachievable standards and providing little or no environmental benefit.” Its Mon Valley facilities have “never been fined” for exceeding benzene emission standards, the company said.\n\nBefore the August explosion, workers and outside observers were already watching Nippon Steel closely for clues about their plans for Clairton Coke Works and the Mon Valley. Now, questions about Nippon’s intentions have become even more pressing.\n\nIn the nearly $15 billion deal to buy U.S. Steel, Nippon Steel pledged to invest $14 billion in domestic steelmaking operations, including building a new electric arc furnace somewhere in the U.S. Much of that money remains publicly uncommitted, and U.S. Steel has been firm that it wants to keep the Clairton plant operating.\n\n“The Clairton Coke Plant is an important part of our North American Flat-Rolled integrated operations,” the company said in November. The company added that a “steady coke supply remains critical” and that the “Clairton Coke Plant will be maintained for the next generation of steelmaking.”\n\nSince Nippon Steel acquired the company, things have started to change, according to Hough. The company has invested \n\n“Nippon is putting the money into the plant, and let me tell you, they’ve got a long way to go,” Hough said. “U.S. Steel let it go so bad for so long.”\n\nHowever, U.S. Steel has not publicly committed to spending money at the Clairton plant to expand production, extend its life, improve efficiency, upgrade safety or reduce its polluting air emissions.\n\nIn response to questions about its investment plans for Clairton Coke Works, U.S. Steel said the company plans to invest “more than $2 billion at Mon Valley Works.”\n\nFurko served as Clairton local union president in 2021 when U.S. Steel canceled a pledged $1 billion investment in the Mon Valley Works. He remains wary of Nippon’s promises.\n\n“Until I see shovels start to hit dirt,” Furko said, “then I don’t believe it until I see it.”\n\nOf the $14 billion, U.S. Steel has said $2.4 billion will go toward its Pittsburgh-area plants. A portion of that money will be spent on building a new hot strip mill to replace the one at its Irvin plant, just down the Monongahela River from Clairton, that processes steel into massive sheet rolls, primarily for the automotive, appliance and construction industries.\n\nIt’s unclear how Nippon and U.S. Steel will address recent findings from federal investigators. In December, the Chemical Safety Board recommended that U.S. Steel conduct a siting evaluation of all buildings at the Clairton plant that are occupied or could be occupied to identify and assess potential hazards for workers. The agency said that the company has not conducted a facility siting evaluation as part of efforts to rebuild and relocate its “personnel facilities” after the blast.\n\nU.S. Steel continues to cooperate with the Chemical Safety Board and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and “evaluate their recommendations,” the company said.\n\nEven with Nippon’s promise of revitalizing U.S. Steel with billions of dollars of investment, the August explosion is still darkening the minds of workers. Furko said he struggles to motivate himself to go to work on some days.\n\n“I’ve been there 25 years. There’s been guys who have lost legs from rail equipment running over them. Bad falls and stuff like that,” Furko said. “Nothing has affected me like this has.”\n\nKelety reported from Phoenix. AP journalists Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, M.K.

    "fullText": "Many social media posts by Tesla CEO on his platform are indiscernible from those of white supremacists, say experts\n\nElon Musk’s longtime fixation on a white racial majority is intensifying. The richest man in the world posted about how the white race was under threat, made allusions to race science or promoted anti-immigrant conspiracy content on 26 out of 31 days in January, according to the Guardian’s analysis of his social media output. The posts, made on his platform X, reflect a renewed embrace of what extremism experts describe as white supremacist material.\n\n“Whites are a rapidly dying minority,” Musk said on 22 January, a short time before taking the stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos, while reposting an Irish anti-immigrant influencer’s video about demographic change.\n\nMusk’s posts included him repeatedly claiming white people face systemic discrimination, endorsing the conspiracy that there is an ongoing genocide against white people in countries around the world and promoting a claim that white people would be “slaughtered” by non-whites if they become a demographic minority.\n\n“If you stripped Elon Musk’s name off of these things and showed them to me, I would think that this was a white supremacist,” said Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Extremism, who reviewed a selection of the posts.\n\nMusk has for years promoted anti-immigrant and far-right content in his posts, as well as endorsed rightwing activists and political parties around the globe. The Tesla CEO’s most recent output displays a more consistent and explicit engagement with white supremacist content and nativist activists than in the past, however, lending them the imprimatur of the world’s richest person and spreading their ideas to his audience of over 200 million followers. Beirich said he appeared “deep into the world of white nationalism”.\n\n“The White ‘liberal’ standard for behavior is extremely strict, but is only applied to Whites,” Musk said on 26 January, commenting on a post that claimed there was discrimination against white conservatives.\n\nMusk’s posts repeatedly echoed prominent white supremacist narratives and ideologies, said William Braniff, the former director of the Department of Homeland Security’s office for prevention of terrorism and extremism. Several of Musk’s posts included what Braniff described as “textbook examples” of white supremacist conspiracy theories such as “the great replacement” – a belief that liberal elites or Jewish people are conspiring to use immigration to replace white populations.\n\nThe danger of Musk’s obsession lies in mainstreaming ideas that are deeply tied to violence and discrimination, according to Braniff, who is now executive director of the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab (Peril) at American University. “The great replacement has been an especially important mobilizing narrative for highly lethal white supremacist attacks in the United States and elsewhere,” he said.\n\nMusk has repeatedly denied he is racist or antisemitic, stated that he condemns terrorism and said he does not advocate for violence. He asserted in a 2024 interview with Don Lemon that he does not He also told Joe Rogan in March last year that he is not a Nazi, weeks after facing condemnations from Jewish groups and the chairman of the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Israel over his speech to Germany’s far-right AfD party in which he told Germans to move beyond their “past guilt”.\n\nAlthough Musk wrote a number of posts on race and immigration himself last month, much of his output involved reposting far-right activist accounts or replying to them with brief endorsements such as a bullseye emoji, implying agreement. On 10 January, Musk replied “yes” in reply to a post from a white nationalist account that claimed “race communism that destroyed Rhodesia and South Africa are the same things they are bringing to America and the rest of the Occident to turn us into the Global Favela”. The author of the post previously published a blog titled How To Build An American Orania – a reference to the privately owned, whites-only town of Orania in South Africa.\n\nSimilar interactions took place throughout the month. After a far-right influencer posted “they just want to eradicate White people it’s that simple” in reference to the New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s inauguration speech, Musk replied on 7 January “some people really do”. On 9 January, he wrote “true” in a quote-tweet of a post that claimed white people would be “slaughtered” as a minority and that “White solidarity is the only way to survive”. On 16 January, Musk reposted a rightwing influencer’s post claiming “white genocide is the official Democrat party platform”. The same day, he promoted another rightwing influencer’s anti-diversity post that used an AI-generated image of tattooed black women on Yale’s rowing team.\n\nWhile some of the accounts Musk interacted with are fringe social media influencers, several others are prominent far-right activists whose extremist views have been well-documented. On 17 January, Musk reposted a screed against “ethno-cultural upheaval” in Europe from Martin Sellner, far-right Austrian activist, who is the founder of the ethno-nationalist Identitarian Movement. Musk, who reinstated Sellner’s banned X account in 2024, replied to the anti-immigration post that “this is simply a statement of fact”.\n\n“Martin Sellner is probably the most significant global white supremacist right now,” Beirich said. “He’s the one who pushed the great replacement, and has now pushed the idea of remigration – ethnically cleansing western countries of non-whites.”\n\nSellner gave a presentation in 2024 at an event in Germany on the logistics of carrying out mass deportations that was attended by neo-Nazis and other extremists. The event sparked immense backlash and protests against the far-right across the northern European nation. Lawmakers attempted to ban him from the country. The Austrian activist also received a €1,500 donation from and communicated with white supremacist Brenton Tarrant, who would later go on to commit a terrorist attack in 2019 that killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.\n\n Sellner rejected being described as a white supremacist and said he respects “the dignity of all others” in a statement to the Guardian, while taking credit for politically mainstreaming the concepts of the great replacement and remigration. “Now, from Trump to Musk, everyone is talking about replacement migration, the ethnic vote and remigration,” Sellner said. He additionally claimed that the Potsdam event was “misrepresented” by media and that he rejected any form of terrorism. Sellner described his interactions with Tarrant, which included offering to get a drink with Tarrant if he ever visited Austria, as limited to standard thank-you emails to a donor.\n\nExtremism experts said the ideas Musk has publicized are deeply tied to some of the most notorious, violent extremist attacks of the past decade, including the 2018 antisemitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh and the 2022 racist mass killing of 10 people at a Buffalo supermarket. The shooter in Buffalo left a 180-page manifesto filled with mentions of white supremacist replacement theory.\n\nMusk’s posts also reflect an increasing embrace of white supremacist figures and talking points among prominent Republicans and government agencies in the past year. Some of that shift has played out on X, where Musk reinstated a number of formerly banned accounts such as prominent antisemite Nick Fuentes. Federal agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security have meanwhile posted content that aligns with white supremacist propaganda. Earlier this month, Donald Trump also drew widespread backlash after posting a racist video to his Truth Social platform that depicted Barack and Michelle Obama as apes.\n\nMusk has repeatedly mocked those who have criticized his comments as far-right or racist, framing his views as common sense or simply reiterating facts and statistics. His rhetoric reflects a widespread tactic among people on the far-right, experts say, when extremists attempt to defend their worldview of an in-group of white people against everyone else.\n\n“That reductionist worldview breaks down when people in your in-group say you’re full of it, that what you’re saying is wrong,” Braniff said. “So now the main requirement is to attack the dissenting in-group, to delegitimize them as race traitors and as woke.”\n\nAs February began, Musk was still posting about race and immigration on a consistent basis. He replied to an anti-immigrant activist this week who claimed that Ireland’s civilization would end “because Irish men are afraid of being called racist and upsetting people from the 3rd world”.\n\n“Such men are pathetic traitors,” Musk responded.",

    "fullText": "We explore the cosy world-building spin-off with Game Freak’s Shigeru Ohmori and his fellow developers – and learn how it began with a Pokémon-hunting dream\n\nPokémon is celebrating its 30th anniversary this month, and everybody knows what to expect from these games by now. The concept is simple: head into a cartoonish paradise full of whimsical creatures, capture them in red-and-white balls and assemble a team of warriors from them, before battling other aspiring Pokémon masters. But the latest entry in the series is different – a game that’s more about building than battling.\n\nIn Pokopia, a refreshingly pacific twist on the series, players are dropped into a virtual world where Pokémon are freed from their spherical prisons and happily roam their natural habitats. There’s one minor caveat – you have to create those habitats by hand, building them from what you can find.\n\nTaking its cues from Nintendo’s all-conquering Animal Crossing, this Switch 2 game sees you rebuilding decaying habitats in order to attract new Pokémon to move into your sanctuary. (Players of the Xbox classic Viva Piñata, rejoice.) It’s a welcome departure from the main series’ long-running training and battling loop. Veteran Pokémon developer Shigeru Ohmori, who started thinking about Pokopia’s concept while working on 2022’s Pokémon games Scarlet and Violet, says that the idea for Pokopia arose after spending many years dreaming about finding Pokémon in tall grass.\n\n“The first Pokémon game I worked on was [2003’s] Ruby and Sapphire,” recalls Ohmori with a smile. “My first project for that game was to create the map – and whenever I put grass on to the map, Pokémon appeared on screen. That feeling of Pokémon appearing when creating the habitat, and then meeting those Pokémon, was something that I really cherished.” He created a basic prototype for Pokopia in his spare time, and then Pokémon’s developers Game Freak brought on Dragon Quest Builders 2 studio Omega Force to help.\n\nThis feeling is lovingly recreated for players in Pokopia. As you create tufts of grass, a Bulbasaur suddenly appears, shuffling his way towards you to say hello. There are no humans to be found anywhere in this virtual utopia. In the strange and initially desolate patch in which you create your Pokémon paradise, you control the adorably wobbling mass of everyone’s favourite shape-shifting jelly, Ditto. Haunted by memories of its former trainer, Ditto decides to take a humanoid shape that you determine in a character creation screen. This is your uncanny-looking avatar, doing its best to approximate a faded memory of a human being.\n\nAfter you’ve customised your Ditto/human-hybrid, you are greeted by a sentient shrub, Professor Tangrowth, complete with a data disc attached to his curly tendrils and a pair of glasses strapped to his chin. The prof informs you that it’s your job to restore this barren land. Where do you begin? In exactly the same way that Ohmori did, all those years ago – by making lush, green grass.\n\nIn order to create new habitats, Ditto borrows moves from each new creature you meet, mimicking their abilities so that you can till the land. Bulbasaur’s ability transforms Ditto’s appendages into floppy, leaf-producing vines. Squirtle’s water gun sees Ditto puke water like a derpy Roman fountain, and Scyther’s cut blesses Ditto with comically oversized razor-sharp blades for arms. In a nice touch, whenever Ditto learns a new move you’re treated to the classic Pokémon level-up music.\n\nFor an hour I wander the barren wasteland, working to turn sand into grass and hacking trees for wood. Everything feels effortlessly charming, with a level of care and polish that elevates Pokopia’s opening 60 minutes above the series’ many middling spin-offs. Like Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Pokopia also allows you to visit friends’ islands and meet their Poké pals, surfing between lands as a Ditto-Lapras or soaring through the skies in the form of a Dragonite.\n\nMarina Ayano, the game’s art director, tells me that she grew up with the franchise – making this something of a dream project. During development, Ayano and the sound director landed on two key words to steer the game’s cutesy and laid-back vibe: “chill and pop”. “Chill is slow and cosy, and pop ensures that everything is colourful … [we wanted] a very universal cuteness,” she says. As I make friends with a Pidgey, build a straw bed for a sleepy Charmander and field a request from an amusingly emo Umbreon who desires a black-painted home, it’s certainly very cute. For Ayano, Pokopia offered a chance to let the cutest Pokémon shine: creatures that are usually cast aside in the mainline games in favour of stronger battlers.\n\nPlaying as a Pokémon rather than the games’ usual human protagonists, you can fully understand – and converse with – every species of Pokémon, and given that Pokémon’s writing is normally pretty bland, the dialogue has unexpected personality. “Because there are no trainers in the game, we really thought about how the Pokémon communicate with each other,” says Takuto Edagawa, Pokopia’s director. “What are they thinking? How are they feeling? We made sure that if you put one piece of furniture anywhere in the world, Pokémon will react based on their personalities. I really liked how it came out.”\n\nPokopia is the first spin-off game that Game Freak has worked on directly, and Ohmori suggests that it may have influenced the direction of future mainline Pokémon games. “Battles have always been the focus, but there are so many [other elements] to these games, and I believe that fans have enjoyed these components as well,” he says. “I would like to show this more and scale the Pokémon games up, outside of battling. And I would like the Pokémon franchise to seek new possibilities to grow the Pokémon world.”\n\nPokopia is released on 5 March; £58.99/$69.99",

    "fullText": "But, after second day of Wall Street falls, analysts say sell-off ‘may overstate AI’s immediate risk to complex deal-making’\n\nShares in commercial property services companies have tumbled, in the latest sell-off driven by fears over disruption from artificial intelligence.\n\nAfter steep declines on Wall Street, European stocks in the sector were hit on Thursday.\n\nThe estate agent Savills’ shares fell 7.5% in London, while the serviced office provider International Workplace Group, which owns the Regus brand, lost 9%.\n\nThe UK’s two biggest property developers, British Land and Landsec, dropped 2.6% and 2.4% respectively.\n\nOn Wall Street, property service firms fell for a second consecutive day. CBRE shares plunged 12.5%, Jones Lang LaSalle lost nearly 11% and Cushman & Wakefield fell 9.1%, after even sharper declines on Wednesday.\n\nCommercial property stocks have become the latest sector to be hammered by fears over the impact of rapid advances in AI, as the sell-off spread from legal software, publishing, analytics and data companies last week to insurance firms, price comparison sites and wealth managers this week.\n\nThe share declines were sparked by AI firms such as Anthropic, the company behind the chatbot Claude, releasing new tools, although there was limited news on Thursday, leading analysts to argue that the sell-off was overdone.\n\nAI has the potential to automate a wide range of office-based tasks and could lead to swathes of job losses. There are also concerns among investors that demand for offices could fall, in a blow to property companies.\n\nJade Rahmani, commercial real estate analyst at New York-headquartered Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said: “We believe investors are rotating out of high-fee, labour-intensive business models viewed as potentially vulnerable to AI-driven disruption.”\n\nHowever, he believes that the sell-off “may overstate the immediate risk to complex deal-making, even as the long-term AI impact remains a ‘wait-and-see’”.\n\nDallas-based CBRE on Thursday reported fourth-quarter revenue of $11.6bn (£8.5bn), up 12%, and core earnings per share of $2.73, above analysts’ estimates. In 2025, revenues rose by 13% to $40.6bn.\n\nThe real estate services firm forecast 2026 profit above Wall Street estimates, on the back of strong momentum in leasing and facilities management, as the number of datacentres rapidly expands and billions of dollars flow into AI infrastructure.\n\nCBRE’s chief executive, Bob Sulentic, believes AI will benefit the business in the long run, with its transaction and investment work “most protected” from disruption.\n\n“Clients engage CBRE to plan and execute complex transactions because of our creativity, strategic thinking, negotiating skills, deep base of market knowledge and broad relationships,” he said. “None of this seems likely to be replaced by AI in the foreseeable future.”",

    "description": "A New York City parent explains why she paid $7,500 for a part-time toddler program to ease separation anxiety before 3-K. She says it was worth it.",
    "fullText": "When I first found out I was pregnant, I frankly didn't put much thought into long-term childcare plans. Living in New York City, my husband and I knew we wouldn't have the traditional village available to us — my parents, while local and thrilled to get a first grandchild, are older and weren't particularly eager to volunteer for solo babysitting, while his parents live thousands of miles away.\n\nBut we were in a uniquely lucky situation: We both happened to have flexible, largely remote jobs.\n\nFor the first few months of my surprisingly generous parental leave, my husband and I, cocooned in newborn bliss (and perhaps slightly delirious from sleep deprivation), didn't stress about what would happen when I went back to work. I figured we could make it work through a combination of creative time management and strategically scheduled naps — at least until our daughter was eligible for 3-K, free schooling available in New York City for kids the year they turn 3.\n\nSurprisingly, this plan ended up working, for the most part, and for just shy of a year, we managed a fairly even 50-50 split in parenting duties. As time went on and my own work ramped up and the baby potato turned into a sprinting toddler, it became clear that my husband would need to become the primary parent.\n\nIt wasn't something either of us had considered before having a child, but it made the most sense: He found far greater fulfillment in being a father than he'd ever found in his career, whereas I had always defined myself by my work as a writer and editor. He kept his job but scaled back, working largely in the evenings and weekends so he could be free during the day for stay-at-home parenting.\n\nAs our daughter became a toddler, she blossomed under my husband's full-time care, with constant adventuring and frequent playdates keeping her days busy. We didn't need outside childcare — but as it turned out, she did.\n\nNew York City has notoriously high childcare costs.\n\nIn the interim between our delicate balancing act and deciding my husband would drastically scale down his work, I considered a number of different options, from traditional daycares (upward of $2,500 a month in my neighborhood for full-time programs) to nanny-share arrangements with other local families (maybe slightly cheaper, but a pain to coordinate).\n\nWe were lucky in that we were able to avoid childcare costs, which would have effectively canceled out one of our salaries, though I still toyed with the idea of enrolling her somewhere part time to get her used to the idea in case our situation changed.\n\nEnter Barnard College's Center for Toddler Development.\n\nI first heard about the program in a local moms' book club I'd joined. One of our first reads was \"How Toddlers Thrive\" by Tovah P. Klein, a prominent child psychologist — and incidentally the then-director of the Toddler Center. Another mom in the book club with a daughter two years older than mine mentioned she was now applying.\n\nI was frankly flabbergasted when she explained the details. It's part research program, where the toddlers are minded by teachers and selected students from the college's graduate program and observed for published research purposes from behind a one-way mirror, and part \"school,\" albeit an extremely part-time one, with each \"class\" of toddlers meeting only twice a week for two hours each day for the duration of the school year.\n\nI was intrigued by the program's unique \"gentle separation period\" and its said mission to help toddlers have a positive first school experience while supporting healthy social and emotional development through hands-on, child-guided play.\n\nAt that point, my daughter was only 18 months old (the halfway point to our 3-K end goal), but I'd already started to suspect that separation might be an eventual issue. With two working-from-home parents, she was used to having us around constantly — and had never had a babysitter.\n\nThe few times we'd tried to step out to grab a coffee and handed her to a grandparent, she would shriek like she was being abandoned. Over the next several months, she also grew more shy, coinciding with her stranger danger peaking.\n\nConvinced our future would be filled with school refusals and drop-off meltdowns, I hardcore pitched the Toddler Center to my husband for the coming school year. We didn't need it for childcare, but I became convinced we did need it to help give our daughter the gentlest, most gradual introduction to being away from us. He was less convinced, sure she would grow out of it and be OK with separating by 3-K, but agreed in the end.\n\nIf the program details were mind-boggling, the price point was eye-watering. Though there isn't a set, publicly announced tuition rate, the Toddler Center offers sliding-scale tuition and payment plans to make the program accessible to a broader range of the population. According to its website, a third of Toddler Center families pay tuition on a sliding scale (I assume the higher-profile alum parents like Amy Schumer, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Robert De Niro paid full sticker price for their kids to attend).\n\nAfter submitting a sliding-scale tuition application, which required forking over the previous year's tax returns to prove we were indeed not flush with cash, we landed on $7,500 as the final figure for our almost 2-year-old to take her first baby steps toward school.\n\nThe first few weeks of the program allowed the parents in the classroom, gradually moving us farther from it (a separate, no-toys-allowed room in the back, meant to be unappealing to the kids) to encourage the toddlers to ignore them and play in the main classroom area. That trick didn't work on our daughter, who simply sat next to the chair of whichever of us had taken her in that day, chattering happily as we tried to gently encourage her to go away.\n\nAs I'd dreaded, the initial actual separation — when parents would bring their kids into the classroom and tell them they were leaving — was horrendous. The Toddler Center mandated that only one parent or caregiver drop off their child each morning.\n\nFor the first few weeks after separation, we could both sit in the observation room, where we were treated to a front-row show of our daughter sobbing hysterically and trying to reason with the grad students to open the door she was convinced we were right behind. It was excruciating, and plenty of tears were shed on our end as well.\n\nThere was virtually no improvement for months, which was far longer than I expected. And I felt an immense amount of guilt for having come up with this idea in the first place: Were we actually traumatizing her instead of helping her? Had I epically miscalculated this? Did I pay $7,500 to torture my toddler and myself?\n\nI was wracked with doubt, and we debated withdrawing her from the program before the first semester had even finished. It was particularly hard on my husband, who, as the primary parent, was typically the one dropping her off and dealing with the meltdowns — and who also really missed her on school days.\n\nSuddenly, though, and for no particular reason at all, it got better. A lot better.\n\nInstead of sobbing by the door for a full hour and a half, she started interacting with the other kids. She found a favorite grad student she'd attach herself to. She played happily on the classroom slide. And eventually, she comforted the other toddlers during their hard separation days, assuring them their mommies or daddies would be back.\n\nWhile it was difficult for my husband to be apart from his little buddy for the few hours a week she was at the program, they turned it into an opportunity for new adventures. In the spring semester, he began biking with her to school, stopping to pick up flowers on the way there and back. Another tradition became that he would bring her a blueberry muffin from a local café every day at pickup. These small rituals helped them bond even more.\n\nI don't pretend to have a handle on the intricacies of toddler psychology, and I can't tell you what the flipped-switch moment was where it finally clicked for my kid that being left at school with her teachers didn't mean we were gone forever. And yes, for the record, she still cried during drop-off the first few weeks of 3-K.\n\nBut I am convinced that completing the Toddler Center program drastically reduced her adjustment period for \"real school.\" Tossing her into the deep end for six hours a day, five days a week, was simply not the right option for our family.\n\nIn the end, I'm glad I listened to my gut, dug into our pockets, and toughed out the tears — and I'd like to think my daughter, somewhere deep down in her toddler brain, is too.",

    "fullText": "There was a time I thought I'd spend the rest of my life in New York.\n\nAfter more than a decade in Manhattan, the streets felt like my own, and my identity felt entwined with the city.\n\nEven after having two babies on the Upper West Side, I was constantly plotting and planning on how we could make this lifestyle work long-term.\n\nAnd then, my husband and I stumbled upon our dream home in a distant Connecticut suburb.\n\nI was four months postpartum with my second son, and with two kids, I was no longer able to get the stroller down the three sets of stairs to get out of our building myself.\n\nThough I loved that my routine included walks in Central Park and my oldest had learned to ride a scooter along the Hudson River, I couldn't deny the appeal of a real backyard and a kitchen with an adult-sized fridge.\n\nThere were days when I swore I could feel the walls of our 750-square-foot apartment caving in, but could we really make the move to the 'burbs?\n\nWe both worked full time — I as a journalist, and my husband in finance. Even though our jobs only required us to be in the office two or three times a week, the distance was still daunting, and commutes would be at least an hour each way.\n\nPlus, what would it mean to remove ourselves from the city's vibrant energy? Would we lose ourselves?\n\nStill a little unsure, we decided it was an opportunity we couldn't pass up. On my second son's first day of day care, I dropped him off with teary eyes, and we drove an hour north to close on a four-bedroom home.\n\nWe gained more than three times the physical space of our apartment in the move, but the real gain was the mental space that opened up.\n\nOur day-care bill was almost halved. My kids traded in Riverside Park for their own driveway and a quiet street where they learned to ride bikes.\n\nI was no longer in a constant state of figuring out logistics or trying to find affordable ways for us to get out. We could invite people over to our house, we could barbecue in our backyard, we could even walk 20 minutes to the beach … for free.\n\nEven though we offset our day-care savings with our new mortgage, life felt undeniably more accessible.\n\nI felt myself start to breathe a little easier. I stopped constantly focusing on how to make more money and advance my career. For the first time in my adult life, everything we had was enough.\n\nThat same settled feeling that brought me peace in the suburbs also felt like a little bit of a loss.\n\nThere's a sense of anticipation in every conversation I had with friends in New York — anticipation for a shoot to wrap, for the perfect apartment to appear, for a deal to close.\n\nIt is a feeling built on ambition, dreams, and the shared experience of sacrificing a little bit of life's comforts to be a part of something bigger than yourself. That feeling lit me up when we were in the city, and connected me to my most creative self.\n\nLeaving the city meant we could no longer catch a last-minute Broadway show or easily see the latest exhibit at the Met. We had to consider job opportunities in a whole new way, and as a journalist, that meant accepting that I couldn't pursue certain roles that would require odd hours in the office anymore.\n\nHowever, most of all, I have missed the sense of belonging I felt before the move.\n\nOn the Upper West Side, I had enjoyed a spirit of communal parenting with my neighbors. No matter the weather or time of year, we were always out at a museum or a playground, meeting up with other families.\n\nWhen you live in such tiny spaces, your kids celebrate milestones at restaurants and rented spaces. You're all in it together.\n\nIn the suburbs, once the temperatures dropped, I felt everyone around me burrow into their homes and didn't see them again until spring. It's hard to make new connections when families aren't gathering at the beaches and playgrounds for large swaths of the year.\n\nWith more space came a greater distance from my peers, which made building a new community feel out of reach.\n\nThe energy of New York was the thing I loved most about it. It was also what exhausted me. Once we had kids, the life I wanted felt too far out of reach. The cost of living, too much.\n\nWith a move to the suburbs, our quality of life improved, and the air still feels more breathable.\n\nThe downsides are real — the commute is long, the proximity to our creative fields feels far, and I have struggled to find my community in a place that has felt more isolating than NYC.\n\nHowever, the tradeoffs are just as real. With more space came more peace, more stability, and more financial opportunity.\n\nWe lost some things in the move, but we didn't lose ourselves. And I like to think we brought a little bit of that New York spark with us.",

    "description": "I compared chicken sandwiches from McDonald's, Popeyes, and Bojangles. My favorite was the most expensive, but the extra-crispy sandwich was worth it.",
    "fullText": "Fast-food chicken sandwiches may look similar on the surface, but not all sandwiches deliver the same crunch, flavor, or value.\n\nTo find out how popular chains compare, I ordered chicken sandwiches from McDonald's, Popeyes, and Bojangles and compared them based on taste, texture, toppings, and price.\n\nFrom classic Southern flavor profiles to more flaky filets, each sandwich brought something different to the table.\n\nHere's how the three chicken sandwiches ranked from worst to best.\n\nMcDonald's crispy chicken sandwich, which is aptly named the McCrispy, was released amid the 2021 chicken sandwich wars and is available in classic, spicy, and — as of January 27 — a new, limited-edition hot-honey flavor.\n\nIt cost $7.69, excluding tax, at my local chain in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nWhen I opened it, I noticed the sandwich had a very light smattering of mayonnaise. As someone who loves condiments, this was a little disappointing.\n\nI was eager to see how it would affect the taste.\n\nThe sandwich was moist but almost soggy. The bun held the sandwich's contents together perfectly, and in terms of size, I thought McDonald's nailed the bun-to-chicken ratio.\n\nI'd order it again, but it didn't blow me away.\n\nPopeyes puts mayonnaise on both buns, with pickles layered under the chicken filet, which sets it apart from other chains.\n\nThe chicken filet crunched and flaked with every bite, and the thick pickle slices were actually tart — they certainly weren't just for show. The sandwich was also moist and tender, without being a soggy mess.\n\nOverall, I was impressed. However, another chain clinched the win.\n\nThe sandwich, which the chain updated in the aftermath of the chicken sandwich wars, features a large filet of fried chicken on a buttery brioche bun. Its flavor profile is classically Southern, built around fried chicken, pickles, and mayonnaise.\n\nThe chicken sandwich cost $8.81, excluding tax.\n\nLike the other chicken sandwiches, Bojangles' chicken sandwich was topped with mayonnaise, but it was thicker than the mayonnaise from other chains. It also came with two crunchy pickle slices.\n\nBojangles' process of marinating its chicken helped to infuse flavor deep into the meat rather than just coating the surface.\n\nThe filet was hand-breaded and fried in-store, creating an extra-crispy, craggy coating that delivered a satisfying crunch with every bite. The pickles added even more crunch, with a bright, briny flavor that cut through the richness of the fried chicken.\n\nThe sandwich also had a subtle kick from the marinade — it wasn't overwhelmingly spicy, but it was enough to add flavor and keep each bite interesting.\n\nTogether, the crispy breading and flavorful filet created a layered texture and flavor profile that set the sandwich apart from its competitors.\n\nWhile it was the most expensive sandwich, I thought it was worth the price considering the extra work that went into making it and the fact that it hit all the marks of a truly great chicken sandwich.\n\nThe chicken sandwich wars are over — for me at least. I declare this sandwich the winner.",

    "description": "Whether you want to escape the cold or plan a summer trip, Florida offers more than just theme parks.",
    "fullText": "Some parts of the US might still be in the peak of winter, but down in the sunnier states, people are already bringing out their bathing suits.\n\nAs a Florida local of nearly a decade, some of my favorite days are the ones when I slow down, bask in the sun, and breathe in fresh air while tubing down a crystal-clear spring, surrounded by the peaceful sounds of nature.\n\nUnlike the rowdy tourist beach towns or overcrowded theme parks, this is the Florida I've come to know and love.\n\nAway from tourist hot spots such as Disney World or Miami Beach, Florida offers hidden gems for all tastes, whether you're more nature-inclined or want to explore towns that will make you feel like you're in Europe.\n\nAfter living in the state for nearly a decade, I found that the best travel destinations in the state are far from the most famous.\n\nWhether you're escaping from cold weather or planning a summer trip to Florida, here are seven towns you should visit.\n\nWhen picturing a Florida beach vacation, you might think of Miami Beach or maybe Clearwater Beach if you're aiming for the Gulf Coast. If you're looking to avoid tourists, however, I recommend visiting the beaches near Jacksonville.\n\nThe North Florida shores in Ponte Vedra are mostly lined with single-family houses along the A1A road and can be far from downtown areas, making it the perfect escape if you're looking to relax rather than party.\n\nMany of these houses, which are often winter homes for their owners, can be rented as Airbnbs, making them ideal for family or group vacations.\n\nThe Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve, a 73,000-acre stretch of wild nature, is also the perfect spot to hike and kayak saltwater marshes while exploring Florida's wildlife.\n\nThe oldest town in the US, St. Augustine, was founded in 1565 by Spanish settlers. Today, the city offers a picturesque destination for those looking for history and charm.\n\nWhether you're enjoying its nearby beaches or immersing yourself in medieval Spanish culture in the city's historic district, St. Augustine offers a wide range of activities for families and history enthusiasts.\n\nDuring your time here, make sure to tour the Castillo de San Marcos National Monument, the oldest fort in the US, and walk along the cobblestoned streets of the historic downtown, like St. George Street, which features a 1716 schoolhouse and dozens of restaurants and boutiques.\n\nEvery holiday season, from November to January, the historic district is illuminated for the city's \"Nights of Lights\" showcase. Walking through it feels like strolling through a Christmas postcard, only with palm trees and Spanish castles instead of snow.\n\nOriginally settled in the 1840s, this tiny community in Florida's Nature Coast — the stretch of the Gulf Coast between Tampa and Pensacola — may not be on your travel radar, but if you enjoy fresh seafood and less crowded areas, it should be.\n\nCedar Key is a small island located about a 2 1/2-hour drive from Orlando and is one of the largest producers of farm-raised clams in the country. You can enjoy fresh, delicious seafood while sitting on the shore of Florida's undiscovered coast.\n\nThe quiet town is often compared to the more touristy Key West, which was Jimmy Buffett's home and inspiration. In Cedar Key, you can also enjoy some of the signature Key West attractions — such as key lime pies and small local boutiques — without dealing with the crowds.\n\nAs a foodie myself, I can only tell you how amazing the seafood in Cedar Key is. The rest you will have to experience for yourself.\n\nIf you're more of a nature person, head over to Ocala to enjoy clear freshwater springs and Florida forests.\n\nThe springs near Ocala are amazing for kayaking or just for taking a dip. While kayaking in the river streams, you might spot some alligators, manatees, and even monkeys.\n\nAdditionally, the area is home to one of America's only elephant rescue farms, Two Tails Ranch, and the longest ziplines in the state at the Canyons Zip Line and Adventure Park.\n\nSome of the best beaches in Florida — and the world — are in Sarasota.\n\nSiesta Key, which has been named as the best beach in the US and fourth best in the world, is a pristine white-sand, turquoise-water beach perfect for families or for relaxing.\n\nThe city also offers a variety of art sightseeing, such as Ca' d'Zan, the Mediterranean-inspired mansion at the Ringling Museum.\n\nIf you're driving from Tampa, prepare to cross the tallest bridge in the state, the Sunshine Skyway Bridge. At its peak height, I felt like I was flying on an airplane looking down.\n\nNear the space-themed attractions at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral is Cocoa Village, a small historic downtown filled with local vendors and plenty of art.\n\nThe small coastal town also has a variety of food spots for every occasion, including an English tavern, a French bistro, and a fully vegan New American restaurant.\n\nAnd if you're looking for a unique experience, you can kayak or paddle the bioluminescent waters of the Indian River Lagoon — you might see a few dolphins, too.\n\nIf you're making your way down the Florida Keys, you may as well stop to visit a couple of its gorgeous beaches.\n\nWhile Key West deserves the hype it receives as a travel destination, some of the other spots in the Florida Keys are often overlooked.\n\nSouth of Marathon Key and north of Key West is Sombrero Beach, one of the most underrated beaches in the US. On this white-sand beach, you can enjoy some of the calmest waters in Florida, perfect for families or for relaxing.\n\nIt's also a turtle-nesting spot, so you might even see a few loggerhead turtles during nesting season.\n\nFor a fun historical sight, head a few minutes down the Overseas Highway, and you'll see some of the remnants of the once-active Overseas Railroad in Bahia Honda Key.",

    "fullText": "It has been 12 days since Nancy Guthrie, the mother of \"Today\" show host Savannah Guthrie, disappeared, and key questions about what happened — and why — remain unanswered.\n\nAuthorities believe 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie, who has limited mobility, a pacemaker, and relies on daily medication for a heart condition, was abducted from her Arizona home in the middle of the night.\n\nNancy Guthrie's disappearance has drawn national attention, amid reports of purported ransom notes and gut-wrenching video pleas by Savannah Guthrie and her siblings.\n\nBelow is a timeline of developments, from the last time Nancy Guthrie was seen to the latest updates in the case, based on information released by the FBI and local law enforcement.\n\nOn January 31, at around 5:30 p.m. MST, Nancy Guthrie went to her family's local home for dinner.\n\nShe was dropped off by family members at her ranch-style home just outside Tucson, in the Catalina Foothills, just before 10 p.m. that night.\n\n\"We know that because we have the garage door open at approximately 9:48 p.m.,\" Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos previously said. \"At 9:50 p.m., that garage door closes.\"\n\n\"It's at that time we assume that Nancy's home and probably going to bed,\" he added.\n\nAt 1:47 a.m. on February 1, Nancy Guthrie's doorbell camera disconnected, according to police.\n\nAt 2:12 a.m., the doorbell software detected a person on the camera.\n\nInvestigators initially could not retrieve that footage because Nancy Guthrie did not have a subscription to store her doorbell feed, Nanos said.\n\nA break in the case came when authorities, with help from \"private sector partners,\" recovered some doorbell footage from \"residual data located in backend systems,\" said a statement on FBI director Kash Patel's X account.\n\nSixteen minutes after the doorbell camera detected a person, police said that Nancy Guthrie's pacemaker app disconnected from her phone.\n\nNanos, the Pima County sheriff, said that Nancy Guthrie's family went to her home to check on her at 11:56 a.m. on February 1 after learning that she had not shown up to church.\n\nA sheriff's department spokeswoman later clarified, telling news outlets that Nancy Guthrie was supposed to go to a friend's house to watch a livestream of a church service, but never arrived.\n\nAfter a frantic search of Nancy Guthrie's home, family members called 911 to report her missing at 12:03 p.m. on February 1.\n\nAuthorities arrived minutes later, at 12:15 p.m. They found Nancy Guthrie's doorbell camera removed and drops of blood on the front porch that later matched back to her.\n\nIn the days following Nancy Guthrie's disappearance, purported ransom notes were sent to local and national media outlets.\n\nOne note included a monetary demand with two deadlines, FBI Phoenix's special agent in charge, Heith Janke, said at a February 5 press conference. The deadlines have since passed.\n\nAuthorities have not publicly verified the authenticity of the ransom notes, but they said they were taking them \"seriously\" as with all leads.\n\nA California man was arrested on February 5 and charged with sending a fake ransom demand to the Guthrie family.\n\nA post shared by Savannah Guthrie (@savannahguthrie)\n\nSavannah Guthrie released her first video message on February 5, begging for her mother's safe return.\n\nIn a video released on Instagram, the famed NBC anchor sat alongside her siblings, Annie Guthrie and Camron Guthrie, and spoke directly to those who may have her mother.\n\n\"We, too, have heard the reports about a ransom letter in the media,\" Savannah Guthrie said. \"As a family, we are doing everything that we can.\"\n\nShe continued, \"We are ready to talk. However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated. We need to know, without a doubt, that she is alive and that you have her. We want to hear from you, and we are ready to listen. Please, reach out to us.\"\n\nIn a short video released on Savannah Guthrie's Instagram account on February 6, Camron Guthrie urged \"whoever is out there holding our mother\" to contact the family.\n\n\"We want to hear from you. We haven't heard anything directly,\" Camron Guthrie said. \"We need you to reach out, and we need a way to communicate with you so we can move forward. But first, we have to know that you have our mom. We want to talk to you and we are waiting for contact.\"\n\nA post shared by Savannah Guthrie (@savannahguthrie)\n\nIn a somber Instagram video with her siblings on February 7, Savannah Guthrie told her mother's abductors: \"We received your message and we understand.\"\n\n\"We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her,\" the \"Today\" show host said. \"This is the only way we will have peace. This is very valuable to us, and we will pay.\"\n\nOn February 9, as the search entered its ninth day with no major developments, Savannah Guthrie posted a fourth Instagram video, this time urging the public for help.\n\n\"We are at an hour of desperation, and we need your help,\" she said, adding, \"We believe our mom is still out there.\"\n\n\"Law enforcement is working tirelessly around the clock trying to bring her home, trying to find her. She was taken, and we don't know where,\" Savannah Guthrie said.\n\nThe morning show host asked the public, wherever they are, to report to law enforcement if they \"see\" or \"hear\" anything \"strange.\"\n\nOn day 10 of Nancy Guthrie's disappearance, the FBI and the Pima County Sheriff's Department released videos and images of a person of interest in the case.\n\nThe black-and-white footage retrieved from the Nest doorbell camera mounted outside the woman's home showed a masked person, who authorities say was armed, at the front door the night she was taken.\n\nThe person, wearing a backpack and gloves, appears to hold a flashlight in their mouth and attempts to block the camera lens with plants.\n\nIt was not clear what time the footage was recorded.\n\nEarlier, on February 10, an FBI spokesperson told Business Insider that the agency was \"not aware of any continued communication between the Guthrie family and suspected kidnappers, nor have we identified a suspect or person of interest in this case at this time.\"\n\nSavannah Guthrie shared those images and videos on Instagram, saying, \"We believe she is still alive. Bring her home.\"\n\n\"Someone out there recognizes this person,\" she said in another post.\n\nArizona authorities briefly detained a man for questioning hours after they released the doorbell camera footage.\n\nThe man, later identified as a local delivery driver, told reporters that he did not know who Nancy Guthrie was or anything about the case.\n\n\"I don't know anything,\" the man, identified as Carlos Palazuelos, told reporters, according to video posted on X. \"I hope they get the suspect because I'm not it.\"\n\nPatel, the FBI director, told Fox News in an interview on February 10 that law enforcement had made \"substantial progress\" in the case over the last 36 to 48 hours.\n\n\"I do believe we are looking at people who, as we say, are persons of interest,\" Patel said. \"But as you know, with any investigation, you are a person of interest until you are either eliminated or you are actually found to be the culprit or the culprits involved, and that's the stage we're at right now. \"\n\nJust days into the investigation, the FBI offered a reward of up to $50,000 for information related to Nancy Guthrie's disappearance.",

    "description": "A young father thought he had anxiety, with symptoms like fatigue and a racing heart. It turned out to be heart failure.",
    "fullText": "Alex Balmes thought he had a bad case of anxiety ever since he was a kid.\n\n\"I would feel my heart thump hard in my chest and then it would just start racing,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nAs he got older, the symptoms like irregular heartbeat worsened. Balmes worked construction in Orlando, Florida, and assumed his job was partly to blame for his exhaustion.\n\nWhen the symptoms became too severe to ignore, he wound up in the emergency room.\n\n\"I was like, there's no way,\" Balmes said. His initial denial led to an \"emotional rollercoaster\" over five months of repeatedly checking out of, and back into, the hospital.\n\nEventually, Balmes underwent surgery for a left ventricular assist device, an implant to help his blood circulate.\n\nHe also overhauled his lifestyle, including his diet, exercise habits, and stress management, with the help of Dr. Yahaira Ortiz, cardiologist at Orlando Health.\n\nNow 33, Balmes shared the warning signs of serious illness that he missed, and how switching to heart-healthy habits has given him more time and energy to spend with his daughter.\n\n\"I didn't realize how sick I was until I got healthy,\" Balmes said.\n\nOlder adults are most at risk of heart failure, since the blood vessels can become stiffer as we age, increasing the odds of a blockage or other problem.\n\nBut Ortiz said she's noticed an alarming trend of cardiovascular issues in younger patients like Balmes. And research suggests that heart disease is on the rise in patients under 45.\n\nThat's particularly concerning because patients in their 30s can delay crucial medical care, not expecting to be at risk of conditions like heart failure or heart disease.\n\n\"Younger patients do not think that they are sick, much less that they have congestive heart failure. They attribute symptoms to everything else but being sick,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nBalmes' symptoms were textbook examples of heart failure: shortness of breath, irregular heartbeat, fatigue, weight gain, and bloating.\n\nChest pain in particular is a serious warning sign to seek medical attention, Ortiz said, but anything out of the ordinary is worth checking out.\n\n\"If you're short of breath just lying down, that's not normal. Extreme ranges of blood pressure, inability to perform the activities that you used to do because you're just too exhausted, abdominal bloating, those are usually the most common symptoms,\" she said.\n\nBalmes said if he had understood the seriousness of his symptoms, he would have seen a doctor sooner.\n\n\"Nobody wants to drive their car until it breaks down. Your body's the same way,\" he said.\n\nOrtiz said there's a lot you can do in your daily routine to protect your heart, whether you're recovering from illness or hoping to prevent it.\n\nShe recommends exercise to all her patients, even if they just start with a short walk. What you eat can also make a big difference, and Ortiz said the Mediterranean and DASH diets are good examples of heart-healthy eating habits: high in fiber, nutrient-dense plant foods, and healthy fats.\n\nHabits like sitting all day, feeling a lot of pressure build up from work or other obligations, and eating processed food high in added salt, sugar, and fat can put strain on your heart.\n\n\"We're just constantly putting our bodies under not only physical stress, but also emotional stress. And this is constant inflammation that leads to premature coronary disease,\" she said.\n\nSince the diagnosis, Balmes said he made major changes to his daily routine. He started managing his stress better, turning off his work phone when he clocks out for the day. He quit drinking and smoking, cut down on sodium (including Gatorade, his favorite drink), and started hitting the gym.\n\nHe lifts weights, but for three days a week, his typical workout is cardio-focused, about 20 minutes each on the treadmill, stationary bike, elliptical, and rower, making sure not to push too hard. He\n\n\"I'm at 90% of how I used to be,\" Balmes said. \"I didn't realize how sick I was until I got healthy,\"\n\nOne big adjustment is that he now carries a battery pack that weighs about 7 pounds, connected to his body to power the pump that supports his heart. It means he can't jump in the water at the beach or hit the Jacuzzi.\n\nBalmes is on the transplant list to eventually get a new heart. But for now, he makes the most of every minute with his daughter — they go outside when they can, and when it's time for Dad to slow down, they play Minecraft together.\n\n\"All this made me get older, faster,\" Balmes said. \"I understand my limit and what I can do, but also find enjoyment in it.\"",

    "title": "Ukraine says its drones hit nearly 1,100 miles into Russia in one of its deepest strikes, security official says",
    "description": "A security source told Business Insider that the drones struck a refinery in Russia's Komi Republic on Thursday.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian long-range drones struck an oil refinery nearly 1,100 miles into Russia, marking one of Kyiv's deepest strikes of the war, a security official told Business Insider on Thursday.\n\nThe drones struck the Ukhta refinery in Russia's Komi Republic, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said. They were only authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss military developments.\n\nThe source said the targeted refinery is located 1,750 kilometers (1,087 miles) from the Ukrainian border, in what was Kyiv's latest strike on Russian energy infrastructure.\n\nThe attack on Thursday triggered a fire at the refinery. Plumes of smoke are visible in footage of the facility shared by the SBU source. One video shows what appears to be a large Ukrainian drone streaming across the sky. Business Insider could not independently verify the imagery.\n\nThe refinery is part of Russia's state-owned PJSC Lukoil Oil Company, and it processes about 4 million tons of oil annually. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which confirmed the attack, said the facility supplies Moscow's military.\n\nThe General Staff wrote on the Telegram messaging platform that \"other components\" of Ukraine's defense forces were involved in the attack.\n\n\"The SBU continues to carry out targeted strikes on the enterprises of the Russian oil refining complex, which ensure the functioning of the military machine of the aggressor country,\" the security service source said in a translated statement.\n\nHitting such targets \"reduces the enemy's ability to provide their troops with fuel, complicates logistics, and reduces financial revenues that go to the war against Ukraine,\" they said.\n\nRussia's defense ministry said that it shot down 211 fixed-wing Ukrainian drones over the past 24 hours, but it did not specify where. Neither the ministry nor the country's embassy in the US immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nSince August, Ukraine has intensified its long-range drone attacks on Russian energy facilities, hitting oil and gas infrastructure on land, such as refineries and ports, as well as tankers and platforms in the Black, Caspian, and Mediterranean seas.\n\nUkrainian officials have described the campaign targeting Russia's energy sector as \"long-range\" sanctions on Moscow, which uses the revenue from this industry to fuel its full-scale invasion.\n\nYehor Cherniev, deputy chairman of the Ukrainian parliamentary committee on national security, defense, and intelligence, told Business Insider earlier this week that striking the Russian energy sector has been \"one of the best decisions\" because \"it is painful for them.\"\n\n\"I think that's why they have a problem in their economy and with the financing of the war, actually, of their armed forces,\" he said. \"We have to continue to do this.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian deep strikes have affected Russia's oil sector. Refining has declined over the past year; Moscow processed 5.3 million barrels a day last month, compared with the 5.6 million barrels it usually processes in January, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia has stepped up its missile and drone barrages on Ukrainian energy infrastructure this winter, causing blackouts in cities around the country and leaving civilians without heat, electricity, and water.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Thursday that Russia used 219 drones and 25 missiles to attack the country during the previous night, killing multiple people in an attack primarily aimed at energy infrastructure in Kyiv and other cities.\n\nUnited Nations officials have called this winter Ukraine's coldest in over a decade.",

    "description": "I planned a road trip with my best friend, and we set the goal of hitting three national parks in one long weekend. Our lofty itinerary was a mistake.",
    "fullText": "To celebrate completing our master's degrees this year, my best friend and I decided to take a trip together.\n\nWe've been close since elementary school, but lived in different places for about a decade. Between the 2,674-mile distance and our busy schedules, we'd never had the chance to go on a vacation, just the two of us. Graduating felt like the perfect reason to celebrate.\n\nThere was a small problem, though. My friend had just gotten a new job and didn't have much time off yet. This left us with only one option: a weekend trip.\n\nWe decided to drive from Reno, where my friend lives, to Disneyland in Anaheim, California. I proposed that we visit three national parks on the way: Yosemite, Kings Canyon, and Sequoia National Park.\n\nMy friend hesitated, but ultimately agreed that it sounded doable enough. We ended up visiting all three, without any major disaster.\n\nOur rental car didn't break down, we made it back home in time for the workweek, and we remained friends by the time our trip ended on Monday.\n\nThat said, we made a lot of logistical mistakes along the way — and next time, I won't set such a lofty itinerary for such a short trip.\n\nMy friend had offered to be added as a driver for the rental car, but in the interest of saving time on paperwork, I declined. This turned out to be a mistake: I ended up driving just shy of a thousand miles on my own and feeling exhausted.\n\nMy night vision isn't great, either, which didn't help with the long drives.\n\nIt wasn't only the drive I'd underestimated. My friend had been conscientious about obtaining park passes and vehicle reservations.\n\nAfter all that, I'd assumed that finding parking spots once we arrived would be the easy part.\n\nIn Yosemite, with all the lots filled to capacity, we had to park a 27-minute walk away from the nearest shuttle stop that also had a place to eat — and, at the end of the day, we raced against the setting sun to get back to the car before we saw any bears.\n\nThe drive through all three parks was pretty much the same: one way in, one way out, and with lots of single-lane switchbacks the entire way.\n\nThe rides were beautiful, especially Kings Canyon, but we'd forgotten one crucial thing: My best friend and I both get motion sickness. The more beautiful a drive was, the worse it seemed to make our nausea, especially at a high altitude.\n\nWe'd remembered to pack hats, fans, sunscreens, and UV tattoos that helped us figure out when we needed to reapply said sunscreen.\n\nHowever, we dropped the ball on packing for the winding roads — next time, I'll remember ginger ale and lots of Dramamine.\n\nLooking back, I planned this trip with a lot of optimism. My friend may have had a point when she hesitated before agreeing to three parks.\n\nGoing into our road trip, I'd only ever visited one national park and had no idea how big they really were. Just one park would have been plenty of adventure, and probably would've left us with a lot more wiggle room to explore and rest.\n\nInstead, we felt rushed. We only saw a small part of Yosemite, but I would have loved the time and flexibility to lounge, sketch, and journal — or the chance to see Mariposa Grove and Tuolumne Meadows, which were a bit farther out.\n\nKings Canyon and Sequoia both deserved a few days, too. We felt crammed by the time we got to Sequoia; the only thing we saw there was the General Sherman Tree.\n\nThere were so many other things to explore — caves, rivers, falls, and other monuments — but we just didn't have time.\n\nEven with a flawed itinerary, motion sickness, and a lot of stress, my best friend and I made an active choice to be patient with each other no matter what, which truly saved our trip.\n\nSure, I was a bit snippy after driving five hours straight without eating, and she got increasingly annoyed about other people walking into her photos, but we didn't take each other's gripes personally.\n\nWhenever we found ourselves getting testy or tired in the car, we'd start listening to show tunes — the original cast recordings of \"Heathers\" and \"The Great Gatsby\" got us from Kings Canyon to Sequoia with smiles on our faces.\n\nWe also tried to take small breaks wherever we could to enjoy the moment, whether that meant letting our feet soak in the water by Grizzly Falls, or pulling over to watch a beautiful sunset by Lake Kaweah on the way out of Sequoia.\n\nBetween living on opposite sides of the country and the demands of everyday life, my best friend and I don't often get opportunities to spend time together.\n\nAlthough I definitely wouldn't ever make a jam-packed itinerary like this again, we did learn that a weekend trip can be an affordable, quick way to reconnect.\n\nWe'll plan another brief road trip soon — maybe next time, though, we'll aim for just one destination.",

    "title": "How 3 solo founders use AI to transform their content into business",
    "description": "Solopreneurs like Katrina Purcell and Gigi Robinson use AI tools to optimize their content creation, boost efficiency, and enhance lead generation.",
    "fullText": "These days, content creation can feel like a full-time job. For solopreneurs running podcasts or active social channels alongside client work, maintaining a consistent presence can be hard to manage without any teammates.\n\n\"I would not be doing this level of content if I didn't have AI,\" said Katrina Purcell, Fractional COO and host of the Managed Chaos podcast. Purcell produces a weekly podcast and publishes related content across LinkedIn, Substack, and a blog on her website. AI tools like Riverside for transcripts and Gemini for content ideation and creation make it possible, she said.\n\nHere are the specific ways Purcell and two other solopreneurs have integrated AI into their processes to make content creation more seamless.\n\n\"I've never really thought of myself as a content-generating creative person,\" Purcell told Business Insider.\n\nBefore generative AI, she struggled to identify which content from her podcast would perform well on different platforms and often took the \"lazy route\" and simply published the same copy everywhere.\n\nNow, she's trained a custom Gem on Gemini to support her in creating content tailored to different platforms.\n\n\"I gave it the brand guidelines for the podcast, told it that it was adept at SEO, that it knew all the latest content trends, and then I asked it to start coming up with content based on the transcripts,\" she said. Prompts she uses include:\n\nShe'll do some light tweaks and editing, but the AI does most of the heavy lifting.\n\nRecently, she wrote a Substack post based on a podcast episode using this process, and a reader reached out to say how valuable the post was for them, and asked how long it took her. She had to admit it didn't take her long at all, thanks to AI.\n\nPurcell added that she's continually training this Gem on new information about her goals and audience, and always \"closes the content loop\" by telling it how different posts performed.\n\nFor Gigi Robinson, who's been a social media creator since college and now runs a consultancy called Hosts of Influence to help other creators with their brands, creativity was never the bottleneck — it was going from an idea to a finished post.\n\nRather than getting in her head about optimizing every aspect of a post, AI helps her get it done rather than focusing on perfection.\n\nFor instance, she's been able to create LinkedIn videos based on trending news stories quickly. She'll copy and paste parts of a trending article she likes into ChatGPT and ask it to generate specific talking points in her brand voice. From there, she can quickly ad-lib a video without needing to script something out herself. This approach helped her get over 100 million impressions on LinkedIn in just 90 days last year (confirmed from a tracking document viewed by Business Insider) and led to more inbound brand deals from LinkedIn.\n\nRobinson has also found AI video editing tools like Adobe Premiere and OpusClip valuable for a first round of edits. She and her contract interns still make nitpicky tweaks, but it takes much less time than doing everything manually.\n\n\"Before, video editing could take hours. With these tools, getting a cut of the video finalized for posting is usually done in under an hour,\" Robinson said.\n\nEsosa Edosomwan, the coach and nutrition specialist behind The Raw Girl and UMI, still prefers to keep her content creation process largely human-driven after experimenting with AI video and finding her audience doesn't respond to it.\n\nOutside of small things like using Claude to optimize social captions or Nano Banana for video thumbnails, the biggest benefit of AI has been helping her turn social media followers into customers. When she had a piece of content go viral on Instagram early last year, the flood of DMs became impossible to keep up with.\n\nFor help, she turned to the AI tool Manychat. In addition to the automations that send lead magnets — free resources in exchange for contact info — when followers message call-to-action phrases like \"workshop\" or \"hormones,\" she's trained the bot to respond to other messages with her brand and voice, keeping the conversation going.\n\n\"I have even had a couple times where friends thought it was me before realizing it was my chatbot,\" she said. \"That has really helped with inbound leads.\"",

    "fullText": "From oral care and nutritional supplements to running shoes, workout apparel, and electric bikes, Insider Reviews tests and reviews all manner of health, fitness, and outdoors products. For close to five years, the team has tested hundreds of products, including items like electric toothbrushes, sex toys, thermometers, glucometers, fitness trackers, massage guns, and teeth whiteners. Our goal is to deliver honest and truthful recommendations for what people use every day to manage their health, wellness, and fitness.\n\nIn addition to research and testing, the Health, Fitness, and Outdoors team's coverage is backed by insight, advice, and counsel from doctors, dietitians, and other health experts to ensure a high level of trustworthiness and authority. Our writers are subject-matter experts as well. Insider's medical review board, which comprises medical professionals from a variety of fields, also fact-checks our coverage.\n\nNutrition supplements: Our recommendations are based on extensive research and expert consultations. We look at the benefits and drawbacks of supplements like multivitamins, protein powders, workout supplements, and more. Many of these guides include insight from dietitians and nutritionists and are rigorously fact-checked by health experts.\n\nOral health: We review a variety of oral health products including electric toothbrushes, whitening toothpaste, floss and floss alternatives, and mouthwash. These articles are thoroughly fact-checked and reviewed by dentists and dental hygienists.\n\nSex health: Our sex health coverage is inclusive, diverse, and mindful, and includes testing and research of things like sex toys, condoms, and lube. We also work with sex health experts who serve as advisers as well as writers. These articles are thoroughly fact-checked by our medical review board.\n\nHome health products: Home health includes everything from using thermometers and pulse oximeters to getting prescriptions delivered, utilizing telehealth services to see a doctor or therapist, and managing other health conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure. This coverage is deeply researched and tested (where possible) and includes expert insight from doctors, therapists, pharmacists, and others, as well as routine, in-depth fact-checking.\n\nWorkout equipment: From sets of dumbbells and jump ropes to pull-up bars, kettlebells, and resistance bands, our team tests a variety of home gym equipment for every type of user, no matter their skill level or fitness.\n\nWorkout apparel: Whether it's a workout shirt, pair of shorts, or running shoes, we rigorously test fitness apparel. This includes sweat-testing tops during the humid days of summer, muddying up a pair of trail running shoes, and working with freelancers of all body types and sizes in order to be as inclusive as possible.\n\nFitness trackers: Our team puts fitness trackers from brands like Garmin, Fitbit, Suunto, Polar, and so many others through a series of extensive on-wrist tests to determine how useful they are for tracking activity throughout the day. That includes using them to track runs, workouts, bike rides, and even outdoor activities like hiking, snowboarding, and skiing.\n\nBikes and bike accessories: As avid cyclists ourselves, we cover popular types of bikes, including commuter bikes, electric bikes, and mountain bikes, to related gear like helmets, pumps, and bike locks.\n\nYoga equipment: From yoga mats and yoga blocks to streaming apps, our team actually practices yoga with everything we test in order to judge things like long-term durability, how well it holds up to sweat and various weights and body sizes, comfort, and portability.\n\nAt-home workout machines: This includes treadmills, rowing machines, exercise bikes, and full at-home smart gyms from big names like Peloton and NordicTrack but also up-and-coming brands. We test for everything — from how much space the unit takes up to how effective (and enjoyable) the workout is — and, ultimately, if it's worth investing your money on.\n\nHiking gear: Whether it's for a day hike or a longer backpacking trip, our experienced outdoors writers cover a variety of hiking products. This means stress-testing hiking boots to see how comfortable they are over miles of trekking, carrying backpacks of all sizes, and wearing hiking pants for days. We even make sure to let our adventure dogs spend some time testing hiking gear, too.\n\nCamping equipment: Everyone has a different idea of what the essential camp kit looks like, so we've taken to the task of testing it all. We have recommendations from tents and sleeping bags to camp kitchen setups, coffee makers, sleeping pads, and headlamps.\n\nApparel and gear: Outdoors is an inherently seasonal category, as most people opt to hike and camp in the summer then throw on skis, snowboards, and snowshoes in the winter. That seasonality dictates how and what we test, but we work to stay ahead of the curve by offering proper seasonal recommendations before you actually need them, so you're well prepared.\n\nOur team spends anywhere from a few weeks to several months testing a product across a variety of use cases. We develop unique testing methodologies for each section of products and create benchmarks by which we're able to effectively judge what we test.\n\nThis means seeing through the entire lifespan of a running shoe, sweat-testing (and laundry testing) workout apparel for weeks on end, riding an electric bike until its battery runs out, using telehealth services as our go-to means of visiting a doctor, following the latest advice from the CDC, doctors, research institutions, and other health experts, or setting out into the backcountry for a few days with nothing but a backpack full of gear in tow.\n\nWe take a product's price, durability, ease of use, and other factors into consideration to offer quality options across a variety of budgets.\n\nOur health, fitness, and outdoors team has many years of combined experience testing, reviewing, and researching products, and are true experts across their beats. Meet the team below:\n\nIf you want to learn more about how each team tests products and meet the rest of our editors and writers on the following vertical-specific pages, check out these pages:",

    "fullText": "One year into Donald Trump's presidency, bitcoin is worth less than it was before he was elected, and the entire market is in the throes of a crypto winter. According to famed investor Ross Gerber, blame the meme coin ecosystem for the broader decline.\n\nThe CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management thinks the launch of the Trump and Melania coins around the time of the inauguration, followed by a subsequent boom in meme tokens, has left investors fatigued and wary of digital assets.\n\nIn his view, meme coins either endorsed or launched by celebrities are either rug pulls or end up looking like one. In either case, normal investors are left holding the bag while celebrity boosters get rich.\n\nHe pointed to World Liberty Financial Coin and the Melania token, which have both plummeted in price, while the Trump meme coin has also shed about 80% of its value in the last year.\n\n\"People dive in and buy this stuff because they buy into the fraud, basically, and then they get burned, and that money doesn't come back. It's stolen from them.\"\n\nThis is only part of the problem that Gerber sees. When people lose money betting on meme coins, he added, they typically turn their back on crypto and don't come back. He also thinks the Trump administration's looser approach to crypto regulation is making the market less appealing to everyday investors.\n\nHe said it is extremely difficult for bitcoin to rally when investors are being scared away from crypto, as demand rises only when new participants enter the market.\n\nGerber also cited other celebrity-launched cryptos, such as the token launched by former NYC mayor Eric Adams and the $HAWK coin launched by internet personality Haliey Welch, as examples of celebrities meme coins that plummeted shortly after they debuted, while leaving investors holding the bag.\n\nGerber isn't the only one arguing that a growing lack of faith in crypto is compromising bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Economist Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, recently argued that it will be hard for bitcoin to rise again until institutional investors increase their participation.",

Byrd said. \"In our view, the company has a viable path to significant annual growth in power and data center capacity, and we include this growth potential in both our base and bull cases.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Cipher Mining \"has entered multiple agreements with data center customers, and has assembled a team with significant data center construction experience,\" the analysts said. As of Q2 2025, the firm had no AI power hosting contracts — now, it has 10 and 15 year deals with Google and Amazon, respectively.\n\nFrom June to December 2025, the equity value creation per watt for companies like TeraWulf and Cipher Mining rose from about $7 to $18, signalling strong demand for power.\n\nDespite Morgan Stanley's big upside targets, the bank said there are risks to its outlook. One is that the firms aren't able to execute properly on their conversion to data centers.\n\n\"These data center projects are very large relative to the overall size of the Bitcoin companies, and execution risks could result in project delays and cost overruns,\" the analysts said. \"This, in turn, could result in greater volumes of equity capital to fund these data center projects, which can cause unexpected dilution and financing challenges.\"\n\nAnother is that hyperscalers could start to pull back on AI spending. Investors have grown nervous about AI capex in recent months, as they continue to look for clues about how the hundreds of billions of dollars in annual investments will pay off.\n\n\"We view a slowdown in AI spend as the largest single risk, though the updates from hyperscalers this past week suggest the risk to AI infrastructure capex is to the upside, not to the downside,\" the note said. \"Though the AI infrastructure industry remains under-supplied with power, it is possible that key AI players could moderate their data center capex for any number of reasons.\"",

    "description": "Roxanne Ardekani has studied in the US, Austria, and the UK. Her educational experience at Norland is unlike anything she's experienced elsewhere.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Roxanne Ardekani, 28, a student at Norland in Bath, England. Norland is an institution, almost 135 years old, that trains elite nannies for some of the world's wealthiest families. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI didn't grow up thinking nannying would be my career, let alone that I'd move to the UK to train for it. I was born and raised in New Orleans. My parents are Iranian, and growing up meant traveling a lot and moving between cultures.\n\nWhen I was 19, I left the US to study abroad in Innsbruck, Austria. Innsbruck is a sister city of New Orleans, and I was able to do an exchange program there. What was supposed to be temporary turned into something longer. Austria just really fit my lifestyle, and I decided to stay.\n\nNannying came into my life almost by accident. While I was studying psychology at the University of New Orleans — and later American studies at the University of Innsbruck — I was looking for a side gig. A friend connected me with a family who needed a nanny. I went to the interview, and it was a perfect match.\n\nI remember thinking, \"Where has nannying been my whole entire life?\"\n\nIt brought together everything I loved: working with children, developmental psychology, and being hands-on. What started as a few days a week eventually became full time. It was so rewarding that I continued working with children throughout my time in Austria.\n\nIt was around that time I started noticing job listings that mentioned something called a \"Norland Nanny.\" I had never heard of it. I looked it up and immediately thought, \"Oh my gosh, this is Hogwarts for nannies.\"\n\nI decided to apply, telling myself I'd roll the dice. If I got accepted, I'd move to the UK. If I didn't, I'd keep working as a nanny.\n\nI started at Norland in September 2023, and I'm currently in my third year. After I finish my studies and complete my Newly Qualified Nanny year (a probationary paid placement), I'm scheduled to graduate as a qualified Norland Nanny in March 2028.\n\nI've studied in the US, Austria, and now the UK. Norland is such a different experience from what I've experienced in my previous studies.\n\nBefore coming here, I studied psychology at the University of New Orleans, then completed an exchange and later switched fully to the University of Innsbruck, where I finished a degree in American Studies and English. I had been in the academic world for a long time, but it wasn't until Norland that I realized how different it felt to be guided through the work and to fully understand what I was doing.\n\nThe biggest difference at Norland is the level of care and attention to detail. In my previous education, it often felt like you were given an assignment and expected to push through on your own. You aimed for the finish line and hoped you figured things out along the way.\n\nAt Norland, the approach is different. The teachers here are like, \"Hey, let's go through this. Let's make sure you know what you're doing.\"\n\nThat shift has been huge for me, especially in my research. We spend a lot of time talking about methodology, data quality, and ethics. We ask whether research is valuable and whether it's ethical — not just whether it's finished. That level of care and intention is something I felt was missing in my earlier studies.\n\nNorland is academically demanding. Our classes are long — about 2.5 hours — and they're dense with information. They're also deeply connected to practice.\n\nAlongside coursework, I'm in placements where I work with families in different settings. I'm constantly seeing how my studies in the classroom translate into day-to-day care, and how different families and lifestyles shape the work.\n\nWe learn how to communicate with parents. We study child neurology. We talk about self-regulation, learning through play and why play matters for development.\n\nOne recent module that really stands out to me focused on entrepreneurship. As a nanny, you're working under families, but it's also your own practice. That class made me think differently about the long-term possibilities of this career. It made me think more seriously about what it could look like to build something long-term, or even eventually open my own practice.\n\nThe biggest change for me isn't just what I've learned. It's how I feel. For the first time, I genuinely feel confident in my skills. I know what I'm doing. That feeling motivates me in a way I didn't expect.\n\nMoving to the UK at 25 felt like a bigger leap than earlier moves. I had friends, a job, and a settled life in Austria. I remember sitting at the airport, UK-bound, with my suitcase thinking, \"I don't know about this.\"\n\nWhen I first arrived at Norland, it was nighttime, and I didn't recognize anything. I had no phone reception and took a bus before eventually getting an Uber. When I finally reached my room, my roommates opened the door, they hugged me, grabbed my suitcase, and pulled me inside. I didn't even have time to overthink it. I think of the grand scheme of time, I haven't been here that long to feel as grounded as I do.\n\nI'm very open to where opportunity takes me. After I graduate, I'm interested in international maternity nursing through the Norland Agency, short-term placements, and eventually starting a business.\n\nWhat I do know is that this training has changed how I see myself professionally. Norland didn't just add credentials to my resume. It gave me confidence I didn't realize I was missing. That's been just as important as anything I've learned in the classroom.",

    "description": "Young cancer patients can land in medical debt from lost wages, missed promotions, and steep costs. The first year of treatment can cost $45,000.",
    "fullText": "A GoFundMe for James Van Der Beek's family highlights a harsh reality of young cancer diagnoses: they can be financially devastating.\n\n\"The costs of James's medical care and the extended fight against cancer have left the family out of funds,\" reads the fundraising page.\n\nThe effort raised over $1 million in 24 hours following the actor's death from colorectal cancer on February 11.\n\nVan Der Beek, who was 48, was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer in 2023 and publicly announced his diagnosis in late 2024. He is survived by his wife, Kimberly, and their six children. The fundraiser says the money will help pay off Van Der Beek's care, cover household expenses, and support the kids' education.\n\nThe family's story underscores the financial struggles for millions of Americans navigating a cancer diagnosis under 50. While it's hard to face steep healthcare costs at any time, it can be especially challenging during prime earning years. Van Der Beek worked in TV and movies from the 1990s to the early 2020s. In his breakout role, he played the eponymous character in \"Dawson's Creek.\"\n\nBusiness Insider heard from dozens of patients as part of a yearlong investigation into young cancer cases. They told us about the credit card debt they incurred from treatment, the skyrocketing cost of health insurance, and the impact of cancer on their working lives long past recovery.\n\nOur newsroom collaboration with health economists at GoodRx found that the average 30-something with a stage 3 colon cancer diagnosis spends $45,000 out of pocket in their first year of treatment. Chemotherapy, prescriptions, insurance premiums, fertility treatments, and unexpected costs like transportation and mobility aids are included in that figure.\n\nLost wages are too — young patients in their prime earning years typically miss out on thousands of dollars in income.\n\nThe GoodRx analysis of data in the national Medical Expenditure Panel Survey found that the average cancer patient ages 18 to 44 loses $5,104 in annual wages and 26 days of work due to illness. This is markedly more than older patients outside their prime working window: Patients ages 45 to 64 lose $2,903 in wages and 18 days of work.\n\nThese numbers are averages, and a particular patient's wage losses and costs may vary depending on their age, job, treatment plan, and location. But it highlights a truth for young adults like Van Der Beek: Bills for cancer care can hit at a time when people are financially vulnerable or facing income instability.\n\nFinancial challenges can also be compounded by career setbacks. Young cancer patients told Business Insider they struggled to balance their workload with constant medical appointments and worried about losing out on promotions. Some had to quit their jobs, while others couldn't afford to give up their employer-sponsored health insurance. Medical debt is among the top causes of bankruptcy in the US, and is more frequently reported by millennials than any other generation.\n\nWhat's harder to capture in data is the emotional toll young cancer has on patients, especially those who consider their careers to be part of their identities.\n\nAs Van Der Beek told Business Insider last year: \"All these beautiful things that I love, and I used to define myself as — a father, a provider, a husband — all that got taken away, or at least paused. I had to sit there and say, 'Well, what am I?' And it was, 'I'm still worthy of love.'\"",

    "fullText": "It's shaping up to be another tough week for the tech sector.\n\nUS stocks slid lower on Thursday, with the S&P 500 on track to notch its third straight day of losses as investors continued to dump tech and software holdings and rotate into other areas of the market.\n\nMajor indexes were up earlier in the day, but tumbled more than 1% around noon. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF, which recently entered a bear market and endured brutal selling last week, dropped another 3%.\n\nHere's where major indexes stood around 12:30 pm ET on Thursday:\n\nThe market's steepest losses were concentrated in the tech sector, particularly among software and memory stocks. Here were some of the notable moves:\n\nThe continued selling pressure is a sign that investors' concerns about AI haven't ebbed despite a relief rally in tech at the start of this week. Software stocks took a beating last week as traders assessed the threat posed by AI and remained cognizant of high valuations in the broader tech landscape.\n\nA trio of AI-exposed sectors tumbled this week, with shares of insurance brokerages, wealth managers, and real estate services firms dropping on fresh worries about AI disruption.\n\nInvestors are also likely reacting to recent softness in the economic data, according to Jose Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers. He pointed to how most sectors in the economy were losing jobs, despite the US overall adding more payrolls than expected in January.\n\nInvestors are also keyed into the earnings potential of AI and are beginning to be more selective about the companies they invest in, he added.\n\n\"You have dwindling AI hopes coinciding with lackluster economic reports,\" he told Business Insider.\n\n\"Software/services are being repriced as agentic AI pressures pricing power,\" Rosenberg Research wrote in a client note on Thursday, pointing to uncertainty around future cash flows among large tech firms. \"The sustainability of the accelerating investment cycle and the ultimate beneficiaries of the growth story remain highly uncertain,\" the firm added.",

Before he was appointed by President Donald Trump as FTC chair in 2025, he vowed to \"end Big Tech's vendetta against competition and free speech.\"\n\nThe FTC warning is the latest snag in Cook's political tightrope walk.

    "description": "Let's take one last trip into the cyberverse with Apple Vision Pro.",
    "fullText": "I'm the latest early-adopter in history. I finally got my hands on an Apple Vision Pro VR/AR headset, two years after launch, and I feel like I'm showing up at a party at 4 a.m., just in time to watch the last stragglers call for Ubers. Back in the more innocent days of 2024, Apple said the Vision Pro would be \"the beginning of a new era for computing,\" but it's become an industry cautionary tale, proof that making a product that's better than everything else on the market (arguably) doesn't guarantee squat.\n\nI've had this thing strapped to my face nearly 24/7 for the last week, and it's a frustrating device. It's insanely cool, among the most impressive pieces of hardware I've ever used, but I don't need to have it. It struggles to answer the most basic question: \"What would I actually do with this thing?\" The same question was asked by many when it launched, and from my late-comer perspective, the answer has yet to arrive.\n\nI love the design of the Vision Pro. The aluminum grey and orange accent with bubbled-out faceplate screams \"NASA moon mission.\" It looks like it's going to take you into orbit. It's so sleek: A single piece of rounded glass acts as both an optical lens for the cameras and a display for the Eyesight feature where people can see your eyes outside the headset. The aluminum alloy frame curves around your face and the cushy light shield snaps on magnetically. The fit and finish (as they used to say in car magazines) is top-notch too. Nothing rattles. No knob or button feels chintzy. There's a heft and solidness to the Vision Pro that makes it clear that this is equipment, not a toy.\n\nBut that makes it fairly heavy too. A Vision Pro weighs between 26.4 and 28.2 ounces, about the weight of an iPad Pro and a half. The headband (much improved with the newest version of the Vision Pro) and external battery do a ton to keep it from feeling saggy, but after awhile—maybe an hour or two depending on your neck muscles—you definitely feel the weight.\n\nI could get into the tech specs of the Vision Pro, the micro-OLED displays and dual-chip architecture, with M2 and R1 processors and all that, but the important part is what the tech does: blow your mind.\n\nAfter a painless set up, the first thing I did with the Vision Pro was check out \"Encounter Dinosaurs,\" a free app that comes with the device. In it, a window opens to a prehistoric world. I'm sitting there enjoying the dinosaur drama on 10-foot tall virtual screen, a little shook at how perfectly defined it is, when the damn Rajasaurus sticks its entire head into my living room. Then it makes eye contact. Genuinely feeling like prey, I said, \"holy crap\" out loud, and the thing reacted. It all feels entirely real. The lighting matches your room lighting. The sound comes from all around you. It's jaw-dropping.\n\nI was ready to go on a full dinosaur adventure in my new space helmet, but then the tech demo ended. It's a few minutes of dazzle. \"Encounter Dinosaurs\" encapsulates the overall experience of the Vision Pro—it's a tease, the suggestion of space flight, only to find you're the third backup astronaut who might get to go to the moon, if congress doesn't cut Apollo's spending first.\n\nBut the tech is so good. The eye-scanning, gesture-based UI (no controllers here) is flawless and feels like you're operating a computer with your mind. The spatial audio is pristine. The integration with other Mac gear is seamless. The definition and brightness of the graphics is perfect—no pixels visible at all. You can even use it to do things.\n\nI'm totally spatially computing right now. I'm looking at a wide-screen version of the display from my laptop floating before me, with a music app open and Olympic skiing in another window. I'm combining my laptop screen with apps from my helmet, sizing and arranging everything in virtual space, and navigating with my eyes and gestures. Everything works great. It's like living in the future. And the future is exhausting. It's not just the weight of the headset becoming more noticeable with each moment or the eyestrain headache I can feel coming on, it's the maximalism of it; it's too much. I'm sure some people dig it, but I feel like I need to escape, maybe to a nice beach or something.\n\nBut the Vision Pro's streaming is excellent, as good or better than your TV, whether you're watching movies from major streaming services, getting fully immersed in an NBA game or Metallica concert (both amazing, by the way), or just scrolling TikTok. The colors are brilliant. There's no hint of edge-blurriness. The dual micro-OLED displays create a virtual screen that's approximately 3660 x 3200 pixels per eye. That's better than 4K, on a display that can be as big as a movie screen. No notes.\n\nGaming is more of mixed bag. It's clear gamers weren't Apple's primary focus with the Vision Pro. You can link the Vision Pro to your PC or Mac for more complex games, but there aren't any real \"AAA\" games developed specifically for the device. There are some cool smaller titles, though. I was very impressed with recently released Retrocade, a collection of perfect ports of 1980s arcade games. They're the best ports I've ever played, because you play them on perfect virtual recreation of actual arcade cabinets, detailed down to reflections on the CRT screens. But it's kind of sad that the best gaming use of 2026's most advanced consumer technology is playing Frogger. There's so much possibility here, but the Vision Pro gaming section of the app store is a lonely place. I downloaded some random games—a shooter, a horror game—all glorified tech demoes. Overall, the Vision Pro apps in the App Store are few and mostly forgettable. Two years in, the ecosystem hasn't developed, which is a shame, given the possibilities.\n\nI'm not sure what I actually want from the Vision Pro. It's advanced technology that you can use to privately stream movies at extremely high quality, play a few mildly diverting games, or get some work done in a new way. Shouldn't that be enough? Maybe. Mine is borrowed, but if I had dropped $3,500 for a Vision Pro, I would not think, \"This was a wise use of my money.\" It's not just the money, though, it's also the friction.\n\nWhile full-immersion virtual reality is possible with the Apple Vision Pro, the focus has always been on augmented reality—real life, just with digital bells and whistles—but it's not really augmented reality. You can walk around with the headset on, but you're seeing the world through some cameras, with a field of view of 100° X 75°, about half of reality's FOV. And the outward looking cameras aren't nearly as good as the display, so \"reality\" is blurry around the edges, where \"augmented\" is clear as day. As good as the tech is, it still feels unsettling and alienating to use, particularly the transition from augmented life to just life. That sense of fakeness plus the strapping-a-heavy-thing-on-your-face factor adds up to it feeling like a chore to use a Vision Pro. It's the kind of device I'd use sparingly—pull it out to show a friend how cool it is or bring it on my next flight—but I haven't seen a killer app that overcomes the pain-in-the-ass factor enough to use it more often than that.\n\nOk, except that dinosaur thing. I want augmented reality to be that, but for longer than a few minutes. I want the transformative, the transcendent, something you couldn't experience any other way to make the weight and digital claustrophobia feel worth it. Sadly, it seems unlikely that Apple will be putting out the Apple Vision 2 any time soon. The future is smart glasses, and it's going to be a few years (if ever) for augmented reality to get closer to reality-reality in a pair of spectacles. Until then, I'll be waiting for the dinosaurs to come back.",

    "description": "The vulnerability may have been exploited in an \"extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.\"",
    "fullText": "It's once again time to update your Apple devices. The company just released a whole host of security patches, including a fix for an actively exploited zero-day affecting iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS Tahoe. These updates arrived alongside the official release of iOS 26.3, which includes features like more seamless data transfer between iPhone and Android. Other security patches address bugs in Photos, VoiceOver, and Screenshots, to name a few.\n\nAccording to Apple's latest security bulletin, the zero-day—tracked as CVE-2026-20700—is a memory corruption issue in dyld, Apple's \"Dynamic Link Editor.\" The flaw could allow attackers with memory write capability to execute arbitrary code—or, in other words, run their own code on your device.\n\nApple says that the vulnerability may have been exploited in an \"extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals\" in earlier versions of iOS alongside CVE-2025-14174 and CVE-2025-43529. Those at greatest risk with this bug are likely high-profile users with access to sensitive data—users who might be inclined to use Apple's Lockdown Mode—but everyone should install the update to patch the issue.\n\nThe patch for this flaw is available for the following iOS and iPadOS devices, in addition to all Macs that run macOS Tahoe:\n\niPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later\n\niPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later\n\niPad Air 3rd generation and later\n\niPad mini 5th generation and later\n\nYou should have automatic updates enabled to ensure you receive critical security patches ASAP, but you can confirm that you're on the latest OS version under Settings > General > Software Update. As a reminder, Apple won't message you urging you to click links, download attachments, or install apps related to security updates.

    "title": "Apple's Big AI Siri Plans Are Once Again Delayed",
    "description": "The new Siri was supposed to launch with iOS 26.4.",
    "fullText": "If you're an Apple fan who closely follows tech news, you might have been looking forward to Siri's big AI overhaul for some time now—specifically, since the company initially announced it at WWDC 2024. But despite delay after delay, rumors have strongly suggested that the next generation of Siri is set to launch with iOS 26.4. And seeing as Apple just released iOS 26.3 this week, AI Siri is closer than ever, right? Wrong.\n\nAs reported by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple has once again kicked Siri's big updates down the road. According to Gurman, the company really did intend to release AI Siri with iOS 26.4, which is reportedly planned to release sometime in March. However, due to testing \"snags,\" the company is instead planning to break up Siri's major updates and distribute them across several iOS updates. Gurman notes that likely means iOS 26.5, which could launch in May, and iOS 27, which will likely release in September, if it follows Apple's usual release dates. But looking at Apple's track record here, don't hold your breath.\n\nAccording to Gurman's sources, Apple is struggling to get Siri to \"properly process queries,\" or to actually respond fast enough, both of which would defeat the purpose of using a smart assistant. Apple is reportedly pushing engineers to use iOS 26.5 to test these features, particularly the ability for Siri to use your personal data to answer questions. Users may be able to flip a switch in Settings to \"preview\" these features, and may treat the rollout as a beta.\n\nEngineers are also struggling to get Siri's app intents to work, or the feature that lets Siri take actions on your behalf. You could ask Siri to open an image, edit it, then share it with a friend, but only if the feature itself actually works. This, too, may roll out with iOS 26.5, but it's unclear due to reliability issues. Siri is also cutting off user prompts too soon, and sometimes taps into ChatGPT instead of using Apple's underlying tech—which would look pretty bad for the company.\n\nApple is also testing new AI features for iOS 26.5 that we haven't heard of yet. One is a new web search tool that functions like other AI search features from companies like Perplexity and Google. You ask a question to search on the web, and it returns a report with summaries and links. The other new feature is a custom image generation tool, that builds on Image Playground, but that too is hitting development hurdles.\n\nLooking even further ahead, Apple is planning more Siri advancements—namely, giving the assistant chatbot features, à la ChatGPT. (That said, it will reportedly use Gemini to power these features.) This version of Siri may even have its own app.\n\nIt seems Siri really is Apple's albatross. Despite arguably popularizing smart assistants for the general population, Siri quickly fell behind compared to the likes of Alexa and Gemini (née Google Assistant). Now, the latter have fully embraced modern generative AI, offering features like contextual awareness and natural language commands. While Amazon and Google users can ask their assistants increasingly complicated questions, Siri still feels designed mostly to handle setting alarms and checking the weather.\n\nThat was going to change with iOS 18, alongside Apple Intelligence as a whole. Apple's initial pitch for AI Siri was an assistant that could see what's on your phone to better understand questions you ask, and take actions on your behalf—i.e., app intents. You could ask Siri to edit an image you have pulled up on your Photos app, and because the assistant is contextually aware, it would know what image you mean, and apply the edits you ask for. Or, you could ask when your friend was set to arrive, and the assistant would be able to scan messages and emails to know that, one, your friend is visiting town this weekend, and two, that they sent you their flight itinerary that gets them into the airport at 3:55 p.m.\n\nThis Siri has never launched, however. While the company has rolled out iterative updates to Siri with some AI-powered features, its overhaul with these ambitious features have been a trial for Apple's AI team. It all stems from Apple's issues with AI in general: The company was caught off guard by the generative AI wave kicked off in late 2022 by OpenAI's ChatGPT, and following some resistance from corporate leadership, have been scrambling to keep up ever since. Apple Intelligence launched half-baked with issues of its own, but rather than launch a half-baked AI Siri, the company has been struggling to build up the assistant internally.\n\nPart of the problem is privacy-\n\nApple is the second most valuable tech company in the world, but a host of factors—including with software, hardware, and leadership—have made it so even Apple can't magically produce an AI assistant. Though, I'm not sold that an AI Siri will move units for Apple in the first place. I can't imagine Gemini moves people to Android, and you can download ChatGPT on any device you own. It's even now built into your iPhone.",

    "title": "These Noise-Cancelling JBL Headphones Turned Me Into an Audio Snob",
    "description": "I was a cheap-earbud-wearing slob—but no more, thanks to these headphones.",
    "fullText": "I'd never owned a really good pair of headphones; it's just not something I've really cared about. But the JBL Tour One M3s I recently acquired changed my mind forever. (Our resident audio expert Daniel Oropeza went in depth about these headphones in his review, which you should read.)\n\nI've always taken a punk-rock approach to sound gear—cheap and loud has been good enough for me—but using these headphones non-stop for the past couple of weeks proves I've been very wrong. Music is better when played through decent equipment. There's so much more there, even in songs I've listened to a million times: I can finally make out what's actually being said in the \"party chatter\" that provides atmosphere in Marvin Gaye's \"What's Going On,\" and who knew there was so much going on in The Dead Boys \"Sonic Reducer?\" And the spatial audio? Forget it: Hearing different instruments from different parts of 3D space is amazing. These headphones have me thinking seriously about stereo separation, constantly messing with the EQ, and turning my nose up to every format that isn't lossless. I'm listening to damn jazz. What's even happening?\n\nOkay, I know active noise-cancelling has been around for 20 years, but I never cared about it—most of the music I like is mostly noise, so why would I want to cancel it?—but it's for cancelling all that other noise that surrounds us. These are perfect for an airplane or car trip but also for just wearing around. I had no idea how much ambient sound I'm swimming in all day at my home office—the fridge running, the cars on the road, the wind—all gone in an instant. Nothing to hear but silence and tinnitus (from too much punk rock).\n\nWhen I first opened the box and saw the smart transmitter/controller thing that comes with these phones, I was like, \"What's this dumb thing?\" But it turns out it's not dumb. It's a Smart Tx Audio Transmitter. You can plug it into almost anything audio and it will wirelessly stream 24-bit audio. Plug the AUX-to-USB-C cable into the beat-up jack at the gym, or an airplane’s headphone jack ,and you can listen with full noise-canceling and high-quality audio. (Now that I'm an audiophile, this is important to me.) It's also a touch screen controller so you can mess around with the EQ to hear Art Pepper's dulcet saxophone tone without taking your phone out, and trust me, you haven't heard Art Pepper if it's not lossless and tuned with JBL's \"personal sound amplification.\" I mean, you might as well be listening to The Dead Boys or something.\n\nIn my old life, I would have left the Smart Tx Audio Transmitter on a bus, but these phones come with a little carrying case where all my little cords have places to live, and I put my audio transmitter right where it goes, because I never want to be burdened with inferior audio again.\n\nI could go on about these headphones, but I've realized that air is an imperfect medium for sound vibrations, so I'm going to sit and stare at the sheet music of Coltrane's A Love Supreme and listen to pure theory.",

    "title": "AI Chatbots Are Even Worse at Giving Medical Advice Than We Thought",
    "description": "Even when they have the “right” information, they can lead you astray.",
    "fullText": "It’s tempting to think that an LLM chatbot can answer any question you pose it, including those about your health. After all, chatbots have been trained on plenty of medical information, and can regurgitate it if given the right prompts. But that doesn’t mean they will give you accurate medical advice, and a new study shows how easily AI’s supposed expertise breaks down. In short, they are even worse at it than I thought.\n\nIn the study, researchers first quizzed several chatbots about medical information. In these carefully conducted tests, ChatGPT-4o, Llama 3, and Command R+ correctly diagnosed medical scenarios an impressive 94% of the time—though they were able to recommend the right treatment a much less impressive 56% of the time.\n\nBut that wasn’t a real-world test for the chatbots medical utility.\n\nThe researchers then gave medical scenarios to 1,298 people, and asked them to use an LLM to figure out what might be going on in that scenario, plus what they should do about it (for example, whether they should call an ambulance, follow up with their doctor when convenient, or take care of the issue on their own).\n\nThe participants were recruited through an online platform that reported it verifies that research subjects are real humans and not bots themselves. Some participants were in a control group that was told to research the scenario on their own, and not using any AI tools. In the end, the no-AI control group did far better than the LLM-using group in correctly identifying medical conditions, including most serious “red flag” scenarios.\n\nAs the researchers write, “Strong performance from the LLMs operating alone is not sufficient for strong performance with users.” Plenty of previous research has shown that chatbot output is sensitive to the exact phrasing people use when asking questions, and that chatbots seem to prioritize pleasing a user over giving correct information.\n\nEven if an LLM bot can correctly answer an objectively phrased question, that doesn’t mean it will give you good advice when you need it. That’s why it doesn’t really matter that ChatGPT can “pass” a modified medical licensing exam—success at answering formulaic multiple choice questions is not the same thing as telling you when you need to go to the hospital.\n\nThe researchers analyzed chat logs to figure out where things broke down. Here are some of the issues they identified:\n\nThe users didn’t always give the bot all of the relevant information. As non-experts, the users certainly didn’t know what was most important to include. If you’ve been to a doctor about anything potentially serious, you know they’ll pepper you with questions to be sure you aren’t leaving out something important. The bots don’t necessarily do that.\n\nThe bots “generated several types of misleading and incorrect information.” Sometimes they ignored important details to narrow in on something else; sometimes they recommended calling an emergency number but gave the wrong one (such as an Australian emergency number for U.K. users).\n\nResponses could be drastically different for similar prompts. In one example, two users gave nearly identical messages about a subarachnoid hemorrhage. One response told the user to seek emergency care; the other said to lie down in a dark room.\n\nPeople varied in how they conversed with the chatbot. For example, some asked specific questions to constrain the bot’s answers, but some let the bot take the lead. Either method could introduce unreliability into the LLM's output.\n\nCorrect answers were often grouped with incorrect answers. On average, each LLM gave 2.21 answers for the user to choose from. People understandably did not always choose correctly from those options.\n\nOverall, people who didn't use LLMs were 1.76 times more likely to get the right diagnosis. (Both groups were similarly likely to figure out the right course of action, but that's not saying much—on average, they only got it right about 43% of the time.) The researchers described the control group as doing \"significantly better\" at the task. And this may represent a best-case scenario: the researchers point out that they provided clear examples of common conditions, and LLMs would likely do worse with rare conditions or more complicated medical scenarios. They conclude: “Despite strong performance from the LLMs alone, both on existing benchmarks and on our scenarios, medical expertise was insufficient for effective patient care.”\n\nPatients may not know how to talk to an LLM, or how to vet its output, but surely doctors would fare better, right? Unfortunately, people in the medical field are also using AI chatbots for medical information in ways that create risks to patient care.\n\nECRI, a medical safety nonprofit, put the misuse of AI chatbots in the number one spot on its list of health technology hazards of 2026. While the AI hype machine is trying to convince you to give ChatGPT your medical information, ECRI correctly points out that it’s wrong to think of these chatbots as having human personalities or cognition: “While these models produce humanlike responses, they do so by predicting the next word based on large datasets, not through genuine comprehension of the information.”\n\nECRI reports that physicians are, in fact, using generative AI tools for patient care, and that research has already shown the serious risks involved. Using LLMs does not improve doctors’ clinical reasoning. LLMs will elaborate confidently on incorrect details included in prompts. Google’s Med-Gemini model, created for medical use, made up a nonexistent body part whose name was a mashup of two unrelated real body parts; Google told a Verge reporter that the mistake was a “typo.”  ECRI argues that “because LLM responses often sound authoritative, the risk exists that clinicians may subconsciously factor AI-generated suggestions into their judgments without critical review.”\n\nEven in situations that don’t seem like life-and-death cases, consulting a chatbot can cause harm. ECRI asked four LLMs to recommend brands of gel that could be used with a certain ultrasound device on a patient with an indwelling catheter near the area being scanned. It’s important to use a sterile gel in this situation, because of the risk of infection. Only one of the four chatbots identified this issue and made appropriate suggestions; the others just recommended regular ultrasound gels. In other cases, ECRI’s tests resulted in chatbots giving unsafe advice on electrode placement and isolation gowns.\n\nClearly, LLM chatbots are not ready to be trusted to keep people safe when seeking medical care, whether you’re the person who needs care, the doctor treating them, or even the staffer ordering supplies. But the services are already out there, being widely used and aggressively promoted. (Their makers are even fighting in the Super Bowl ads.) There’s no good way to be sure these chatbots aren’t involved in your care, but at the very least we can stick with good old Dr. Google—just make sure to disable AI-powered search results.",

We are going to fire into them on Thursday night and see what we can do.\n\n\"If we sit here and focus on Hull KR too much and rave on about how great they are, they will beat us quite comfortably.\n\n\"So we are going out there to get the win on Thursday – it's as simple as that.\"\n\nWhat can we expect from 2026 Super League season?\n\nYork and Toulouse to play in expanded Super League\n\nSuper League: York Knights v Hull KR\n\nThursday, 12 February, 20:00 GMT\n\nListen to commentary on BBC Radio 5 sports extra, BBC Radio York and BBC Radio Humberside\n\nThe Knights help kick off the newly expanded Super League, which has lost Salford Red Devils since last season but gained three new sides in York, Bradford Bulls and Toulouse Olympique.\n\nYork only learned they would be moving up into the top flight in October, meaning they have had to transform from a part-time to a full-time set up in a matter of months.\n\nAnd Harris insisted his side must ignore the \"outside noise\" as they head into the new campaign with little expectation from those outside the club.\n\n\"It's for other people to either write us off or back us,\" he said.\n\n\"That is their opinion and, with all due respect, we won't listen to good or bad. All we care about is our opinion of ourselves and our coaches' opinions of us.\n\n\"So we will keep the outside noise outside and focus on what we need as a group.\"\n\nKnights' coach Mark Applegarth, who has been at the club since June 2024, is another relishing the prospect of going head-to-head with established Super League coaches, including Hull KR's Willie Peters, Warrington's Sam Burgess, Matt Peet of Wigan and Leigh's Adrian Lam.\n\n\"That is what is exciting and what drives you,\" said Applegarth, who previously had a spell as a Super League head coach with Wakefield in 2023.\n\n\"If you didn't feel that you belong you are probably not in the right job. I feel like I belong there and I can do some damage there as a coach.\n\n\"That is the beauty of life that you dare to dream and I firmly believe that I belong there. I have that burning desire to improve and I really can't wait.\"",

    "description": "Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor says she wants Paul Green's exit as head of women's football after 13 years kept \"private and confidential\".",
    "fullText": "Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor wants to \"keep it private and confidential\" as to why Paul Green suddenly left the club after 13 years.\n\nGreen left his role as head of women's football on Monday evening, despite having a significant impact on their success in the last decade.\n\nDuring his time at the club, the majority spent working with former boss Emma Hayes, Chelsea won 19 trophies, including six Women's Super League titles in a row.\n\nThere was speculation about Green's departure in reports this week, external but, when asked if the fans deserved more of an explanation, Bompastor said: \"I think it's probably not a question for me to answer. Maybe some other people in the club can answer that question.\n\n\"But for sure, every player and member of staff, recognise what Paul did for this club and all the success he brought from the beginning. We are all really thankful for that.\n\n\"I think he laid the foundations from the beginning and has been a huge part of the success of this club. I think he will be missed at this club for sure.\"\n\nChelsea are third in the WSL, nine points adrift of leaders Manchester City, as they prepare for Sunday's home fixture against Liverpool.\n\nA number of players in the squad posted about Green's exit on social media and their subsequent disappointment, including Erin Cuthbert and Millie Bright.\n\nStriker Sam Kerr said his departure was a \"big, big loss for the club\", while ex-Chelsea boss Hayes described him as \"the absolute best in the business\".\n\n\"Everyone was sad. On a human level, it's never positive news to have someone leaving the building,\" added Bompastor, when asked on Thursday about the reaction to the news.\n\n\"We need to focus on what is coming next. That is difficult sometimes as we have emotions and feelings. But we just need to focus on what we can control in the future.\n\n\"We are professionals. We have to bounce back and the game on Sunday is the most important thing.\"\n\nFormer Manchester City striker Ellen White told the Women's Football Weekly podcast that Green had been the \"heartbeat\" of Chelsea behind the scenes.\n\n\"He had an impact on recruitment,\" she added. \"They were always two or three years ahead of everyone else and that took them to another level.\n\n\"He had a huge part in building everything that Chelsea stands for, so it is really sad he's left. It will be interesting to see what happens now.\"\n\nGreen's departure raised questions over the increased involvement of co-sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley, and their decision-making in relation to the women's team.\n\nBompastor signed a contract extension last week, keeping her at the club until 2030.\n\nAsked whether she was happy with the level of autonomy she held at Chelsea, the Frenchwoman said: \"I think I'm happy with where the club is going and the direction the club is going in.\n\n\"My job is to focus on what's on the pitch.\n\n\"My job right now as a manager is to make sure I make this team as successful as possible, I win games with my team and I give the players clarity to perform on the pitch. That's the only thing I can control and that's my main focus.\"\n\nBompastor insisted \"the processess are still working and running\", despite noticeable disappointments in recent transfer windows.\n\nFollowing their 5-1 WSL defeat by Manchester City, she raised concerns over their summer recruitment, admitting she \"would have liked to have been in a better place\" after it.\n\nThe Blues did not make any signings in January, despite falling behind their WSL rivals, and had multiple bids for Paris St-Germain midfielder Jennifer Echegini turned down on deadline day.\n\nFollowing recent concerns, a report in the Athletic, external suggested some players had not taken to Bompastor's training methods.\n\nBut she responded: \"I know there is a lot of noise going on about our team outside the environment. I know we can't control any of that.\n\n\"But I know my players are with me. We are all together focusing on the next game and what is next in the season for us.\n\n\"I guarantee they have the trust and belief that we can achieve great things.\"\n\nIt's been a chaotic and damaging few weeks at Chelsea - a club that were a previously impenetrable force in the WSL.\n\nThey have set standards on the pitch, winning six successive titles, and have made a number of high-profile signings in previous transfer windows to remain on top.\n\nHowever, their rapid fall from grace this season has been alarming and the cracks in their armour are now more apparent than ever.\n\nBompastor has been under scrutiny from her own fanbase, having to answer questions on her position and was defiant in her response.\n\nJust as she had started the process of rebuilding with their victory over Tottenham on Sunday, the shock announcement of Green's exit threw a spanner in the works.\n\nSources told BBC Sport the news came as a surprise to Bompastor and her players, with many upset by the decision and confused by the reasons.\n\nBompastor and Green appeared to have a good relationship, often seen talking at length on the pitch after games, and were aligned in their ambitions.\n\nWhile she cannot admit as much publicly, Green's exit will undoubtedly have an impact on her role as she loses a key ally in the boardroom.\n\nIt is a crucial few months for Chelsea with a number of senior players, including Australia striker Sam Kerr, captain Millie Bright and England internationals Hannah Hampton and Lucy Bronze coming to the end of their contracts and a transition period on the cards.\n\nIt is a worrying time for fans, irrelevant of what happens on the pitch for the rest of the season, with the club's structure clearly undergoing an unfamiliar shift.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "fullText": "Former Arsenal footballer Thomas Partey has been charged with two additional counts of rape against a new alleged victim.\n\nIt comes after the 32-year-old previously pleaded not guilty to five counts of rape against two women, and one count of sexual assault allegedly relating to a third woman.\n\nIt means Partey now stands accused of sexual offences against four women.\n\nThe two new charges relate to alleged offences in 2020 which were first reported to police last August. They follow a new investigation from the Metropolitan Police.\n\nPartey will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 13 March for a first hearing relating to the two new charges.\n\nThe Ghanaian international was given conditional bail at Southwark Crown Court in September after entering not guilty pleas to the original five charges.\n\nThe alleged offences, which he was charged with last year, took place between 2021 and 2022 when he was playing for north London club Arsenal.\n\nHe was charged four days after leaving Arsenal when his contract expired at the end of June.\n\nThe charges followed an investigation by detectives, which started in February 2022 after police first received a report of rape.\n\nThe trial is scheduled to take place under a High Court judge on 2 November this year.\n\nSince departing the Premier League, Partey has been playing for Spanish football club Villareal. He joined on a one-year deal in the summer, with the signing confirmed after the midfielder had been charged with rape.\n\nPartey joined Arsenal for £45.3m from Atletico Madrid in October 2020 and made 130 Premier League appearances for Mikel Arteta's side.\n\nHis lawyer, Jenny Wiltshire, has previously said he \"denies all the charges against him\" and that he welcomed \"the opportunity to finally clear his name\".",

    "fullText": "The International Cricket Council has been urged to review the rules concerning 12th man duties which denied Scott Currie the chance to play for Scotland at the men's T20 World Cup.\n\nPoole-born Currie, 24, has played three one-day internationals for Scotland having qualified for the Saltires through his Scottish father.\n\nPotentially he could have been lining up to play for Scotland against England in Kolkata on Saturday, alongside brother Brad, only to be deemed ineligible for the tournament because of ICC red tape.\n\nThe Hampshire all-rounder was called up by England for a three-match T20 international series against Ireland last September as a replacement for the injured Saqib Mahmood.\n\nCurrie was not picked in England's playing XI for any of the matches which took place in Malahide, but because he undertook 12th man duties he is now ineligible for Scotland for three years.\n\nSection 2.2 of the ICC's player eligibility regulations state that Currie \"participated\" as a \"non-playing official substitute\".\n\nCricket Scotland chief executive Trudy Lindblade said the ICC ruling seems \"quite strange\" compared to other sports.\n\nUnder the rules governing football and rugby union, Currie would have been eligible to play for Scotland having not won an official cap.\n\n\"I don't know when that rule was last looked at, so maybe it is time to have a re-look at that and confirm that what is in place is correct or whether alterations are needed,\" Lindblade told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Is that rule still relevant today in that evolution of our sport where players do move around a lot more from that perspective?\"\n\nUnder ICC regulations players can switch allegiances from associate countries like Scotland to full members like England immediately provided they meet all the other qualification requirements, but they must wait three years the other way.\n\nCurrie declined to comment but has previously spoken of his \"immense pride\" at playing international cricket for Scotland.\n\n\"Taking the field with my brother [Brad], knowing what is means to my old man and his side of the family, is something that always puts a smile on face,\" he said last year.\n\nAn ICC spokesperson told BBC Sport that should a member \"wish to revisit this clause\" then it can be \"raised and discussed, in the first instance, at a men's cricket committee meeting later this month\".\n\nListen to the full interview with Cricket Scotland chief executive Trudy Lindblade broadcast on 31 January on BBC Stumped.\n\nEngland too 'careful' in defeat by Windies - Brook\n\nRefugee Ihsan swaps 'tapeball' cricket for World Cup\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "After Sean Dyche's reign lasts just 114 days, Nottingham Forest are on the hunt for a fourth head coach of the season - but as he hard done by?",
    "fullText": "When Sean Dyche was nominated for the January manager of the month award just seven days ago, he presumably did not expect to be out of a job two games later.\n\nDefeat by Leeds United and a goalless draw in Wednesday's meeting with bottom side Wolves has prompted Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis to call time on Dyche's four-month tenure as head coach, but the former Burnley and Everton boss could argue he has been hard done by.\n\nThat nomination came on the back of league wins over Brentford and struggling West Ham United, defeat by third-placed Aston Villa and a point at home to leaders Arsenal.\n\nThrow in an FA Cup exit on penalties at the hands of Championship side Wrexham, a Europa League defeat by Sporting Braga, followed by a thumping win over Ferencvaros to secure a knockout phase play-off, and Forest's form since the turn of the year has been the definition of a mixed bag.\n\nIn fact, in a league table based on the 18 matches since Dyche took charge on 21 October, they sit 12th. The Englishman departs the City Ground having won six of those games, collecting more league points - 22 - in the same number of games than Forest's two previous managers combined.\n\nThat win rate of 33.3% is the best of Dyche's top-flight managerial career, surpassing the 27.9% he recorded at Burnley and the 28% achieved at Everton. By the same measure, Dyche sits a respectable third out of Forest's eight permanent Premier League managers.\n\nForest open Pereira talks after sacking Dyche\n\nDyche leaves the club in 17th, one place higher than he found them, but just three league wins at home, the last of which was on 14 December, had led to frustration among the Forest faithful. Their displeasure was audible in that defeat in Braga, where the travelling support booed their team off the pitch.\n\nWhoever Forest appoint as their fourth permanent head coach of the season, the ongoing problem this term is a lack of goals.\n\nThe club's all-time Premier League top scorer, Chris Wood, did not play a single minute under Dyche because of a knee injury picked up in his predecessor Ange Postecoglou's final game.\n\nOnly Wolves have scored fewer than Forest's 25 goals in the league, and particularly glaring is how profligate their forward line has been in Wood's absence.\n\nForest's 35 shots without scoring on Wednesday night was the most by a team without finding the net in almost a decade.\n\nWhile Dyche's stats showed he was essentially fulfilling the brief, his style and methods had already raised the question about how sustainable his reign would be.\n\nDyche's argument is he had to play with what he had and, up until last month, he was still getting results, but more would have been expected with a squad including Murillo, Elliot Anderson, Morgan Gibbs-White and Callum Hudson-Odoi.\n\nThere was internal frustration at Forest over Postecoglou's inability, despite encouragement, to build a bond with the fans and the club, but Dyche struck the right tone immediately.\n\nA product of the club's youth system, Dyche tapped into memories of Brian Clough and his dog Del-Boy, and of running by the River Trent, but it only appeased fans - and players - for so long.\n\nHe was credited with initially raising the mood after Postecoglou's brief reign as Forest looked to rediscover their unity.\n\nYet sources suggest he struggled to bond with some of the players and they questioned his methods and tactics, as he focused on the physicality of the squad.\n\nPlayers' opinions were also canvassed in the aftermath of the Leeds game and they did not give Dyche their full backing.\n\nIt was a decision made with reluctance, but Dyche's appointment was out of necessity in the first place after the self-inflicted wounds of Nuno Espirito Santo's exit and Postecoglou's appointment.\n\nDyche's dismissal may have been unavoidable but Marinakis' judgement and temperament will be called into question as he fights to get it right this time.",

    "description": "Skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych is banned from competing at the Winter Olympics for continuing to wear a helmet that features images of athletes killed during Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian skeleton pilot Vladyslav Heraskevych says being banned from competing at the Winter Olympics is the \"price of our dignity\".\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) has banned Heraskevych for continuing to wear a helmet featuring images of athletes killed during Russia's invasion of his home country, which the IOC says breaks its rules.\n\nHeraskevych, who wore the helmet in all of his training runs before the competition began on Thursday, was told by the IOC on Tuesday it \"does not comply\" with the Olympic charter and that he was not allowed to wear it.\n\nIOC president Kirsty Coventry visited the 26-year-old at Cortina's sliding track at 07:30 local time on Thursday before the first skeleton heat in a final attempt to convince him not to wear the helmet in competition.\n\nBut the IOC said Heraskevych \"did not consider any form of compromise\".\n\nIt said: \"The IOC was very keen for Mr Heraskevych to compete. This is why the IOC sat down with him to look for the most respectful way to address his desire to remember his fellow athletes who have lost their lives following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\"\n\nThe IOC added that Heraskevych, who was considered to have an outside chance of a medal based on his training times, had been banned for contravening athlete guidelines, rather than because of displaying political propaganda.\n\nResponding on social media after being banned, Heraskevych wrote:, external \"This is [the] price of our dignity.\"\n\nSpeaking to BBC Sport, he added: \"I could be among the medallists in this event, but suddenly because of some interpretation of the rules which I do not agree with, I am not able to compete while other athletes in the same situation were able to compete, and they didn't face any sanctions.\"\n\n'Shocking' or correct - why Ukraine skeleton slider was banned\n\nThe IOC said he was banned for contravening the 'athlete expression' guidelines, which were drawn up in 2023 and are part of Olympic law.\n\nThey state that: \"The focus at the Olympic Games must remain on athletes' performances, sport and the harmony that the Games seek to advance.\n\n\"It is a fundamental principle that sport at the Olympic Games is neutral and must be separate from political, religious and any other type of interference.\n\n\"Specifically, the focus on the field of play during competitions and official ceremonies must be on celebrating athletes' performances.\"\n\nHeraskevych, who said he felt \"emptiness\" at not being allowed to compete, said the ban was not consistent with other decisions taken at the Games.\n\n\"'Expression guidelines', I believe it's a very big term. What do you consider as 'expression'? Many athletes here have helmets with different paints [colours] and I believe it's also a kind of expression,\" he said.\n\n\"Some athletes have national symbols, it's also an expression but for some reason their helmets were not checked. They are allowed to compete, but I am not.\"\n\nHeraskevych insists his tribute is no different to those that other athletes have displayed, such as figure skater Maxim Naumov.\n\nThe American held up a photo of his parents, who were among 67 people killed in a plane crash in Washington DC just over a year ago, while waiting for his score to be announced on Tuesday.\n\nHeraskevych's accreditation for the Games was initially withdrawn by the IOC but, following a \"very respectful\" conversation with the committee's president Coventry, that decision was overturned and he will be allowed to remain at the event but not compete.\n\nAsked how strongly he felt about commemorating those who have been killed during the Russian invasion, Heraskevych said: \"I believe they deserve to be here because of their sacrifice.

We can't have them all in competition [with each other at the Games],\" he said.\n\n\"The field of play could become a field of expression, you could see it would lead to chaos. We cannot have athletes put on them by political masters to make expressions during competition.\n\n\"We do our best to create a level playing field, I make no apologies for that.\"\n\nAdams said IOC president Coventry had left the meeting with Heraskevych in tears as she felt \"very emotional\" about the matter, adding that \"the meeting was good, personal and respectful\".\n\nHe also denied that the IOC had been pressured by either the Russian Olympic Committee or the Russian government to ban Heraskevych, and said the Ukrainian would have access to a Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) commission should he wish to appeal.\n\nThe IOC said athletes are able to \"express grief with dignity and respect\" at multi-faith centres in the Olympic villages.\n\nIt added that Heraskevych has been \"supported by the IOC for the last three editions of the Games\" and that he is an Olympic scholarship athlete.\n\n\"Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the IOC also set up a solidarity fund for Ukrainian sport to support the athletes' preparations for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games,\" it said.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Lance Stroll says Aston Martin are four seconds off the pace in the run-up to the new Formula 1 season.\n\nThe new car, created under the leadership of design legend Adrian Newey, has struggled for both pace and reliability so far in pre-season testing.\n\nThe Canadian was 5.2 seconds off the pace when he drove the car at the start of the first Bahrain pre-season test on Wednesday.\n\nTeam-mate Fernando Alonso ended Thursday 3.975secs off the best time and 14th fastest out of 15 drivers running.\n\nStroll, son of team owner Lawrence Stroll, said: \"Right now we look like we're four seconds off the top teams, four and a half seconds.\n\n\"Impossible to know what fuel loads and everything people are running. But now we need to try and find four seconds of performance.\"\n\nFerrari's Charles Leclerc set the pace with a lap of one minute 34.273 seconds, 0.511secs ahead of world champion Lando Norris in the McLaren\n\nHeadline lap times in pre-season testing are notoriously unreliable as accurate predictors of genuine form, but Aston Martin are under no illusions about the struggle they have on their hands.\n\nNew cars 'like Formula E on steroids' - Verstappen\n\nStroll said it was \"just a difference in grip and performance\", and asked how the team would improve, he said: \"I don't think it falls from the sky. I think you have to improve and find performance in the car and the engine.\"\n\nThe Aston Martin design was described by Newey at the team's launch earlier this week as \"one of the more extreme interpretations\" of this year's new rules, and it has drawn admiring glances from rivals.\n\nBut so far the car has not shown any signs of performance, and the same can be said of the new engine designed by Honda, who have switched to Aston Martin this year from Red Bull.\n\nThe 27-year-old admitted that \"a big part\" of the car's problems came from the engine. Asked whether there was anything positive he could say about the car, he said: \"The livery looks nice.\"\n\nOn Newey's role as team principal, a position he took on in November in addition to being managing technical partner, Stroll said: \"He's all about performance. He's just obsessed about how he can bring more performance to the car and he's a great leader overall.\"\n\nNewey joined Aston Martin only in March last year and the team have been careful to play down expectations for their first season as a works team.\n\nStroll said: \"We are where we are. Do we want to fight for race wins? Yes. Are we fighting for race wins today? Doesn't look like it. Does that mean we can't fight for race wins in the future? No, I believe we can.\n\n\"I don't have a crystal ball. It doesn't look like it's amazing.\"\n\n1. Charles Leclerc (Mon) Ferrari, one minute 34.273 seconds\n\n2.

    "fullText": "Four-time world champion Max Verstappen says the new cars in Formula 1 this year are \"not a lot of fun\" and \"like Formula E on steroids\".\n\nThe Red Bull driver says the increased demands for energy management with new hybrid engines are \"just not Formula 1\".\n\nThe new engines are energy starved because of the way the rules have been structured and require several kinds of recovery to ensure the battery has sufficient levels of charge for optimum lap times.\n\nThis is leading to unusual forms of driving, such as not accelerating out of the final corner before a qualifying lap, lifting and coasting to save energy when trying for ultimate performance, and changing down to lower gears in corners for optimum energy harvesting.\n\nAston Martin 'look four seconds off top teams'\n\nVerstappen, whose team have built their own engine for the first time this season, said: \"The right word is management. But on the other hand, I also know how much work has been going on in the background. Also from the engine side, for the guys. So it's not always the nicest thing to say.\n\n\"But I also want to be realistic. As a driver, the feeling is not very Formula 1-like. It feels a bit more like Formula E on steroids.\n\n\"As a pure driver, I enjoy driving flat out. And at the moment, you cannot drive like that. There's a lot going on.\n\n\"A lot of what you do as a driver, in terms of inputs, has a massive effect on the energy side of things.\n\n\"For me, that's just not Formula 1. Maybe it's better to drive Formula E, right? Because that's all about energy efficiency and management. That's what they stand for. Driving-wise, it's not so fun.\"\n\nHe added: \"All the good drivers will be able to adapt to it. That's not the problem, but it's just the whole way of racing is changing, and I would say less pure.\n\n\"I just want normal driving, just how it should be, without having to, 'oh, if I brake a bit longer or less or more, or one gear up or down', you know, stuff like that, that it so heavily impacts the performance on the straights.\"\n\nThe all-electric Formula E series has become known for featuring heavy energy management to ensure cars can get to the end of the races without running out of charge.\n\nF1 is not in the same situation. Rather than a single amount of charge that depletes from maximum to empty from the beginning of the race to the end as in Formula E, the batteries in F1 will go from full charge to very low and back again several times a lap.\n\nBut Verstappen's point is that a lack of energy to run flat out all the time is taking the sport away from its traditional form of driving.\n\nSenior figures in F1 have cautioned against jumping to conclusions about the new rules at such an early stage when everything about the cars is new.\n\nThe biggest regulation change in F1 history has this year seen new rules for chassis, engines, tyres and the introduction of sustainable fuels.\n\nThe engines have a near 50-50 split between the internal combustion and electrical parts and have three times as much electrical power as last year with a battery of more or less the same size.\n\nThere are ways the rules could have been constructed to ensure energy management was not such a feature, for example by slightly reducing the power of the hybrid element and allowing the engines to use more fuel, or even by allowing recovery of energy from the front axle as well as the rear. But none of those have so far been allowed.\n\nOn the chassis side, a straight-line mode has been introduced which reduces drag from the front and rear wings specifically to aid energy recovery. The tyres have been made narrower for the same reasons. And the cars are smaller and lighter and have less grip and downforce.\n\nThe cars recover energy in four ways:\n\nRunning the engine at high revs in corners\n\nLifting off early and coasting at the end of straights\n\nRunning the electrical motor against the engine at 100% throttle\n\nVerstappen is considering competing in the Nurburgring 24 Hours at the famous 14-mile long Nordschleife circuit this year in a GT car - a modified road car.\n\nVerstappen said: \"Looking at it now, at least maybe I can drive flat out there, without looking after my battery. I mean, I want to do it, we are working on it to make it happen, but I cannot confirm it yet.\"\n\nF1 2026 cars in pictures at Bahrain testing\n\nActive aero and overtake mode - F1's new terminology\n\nCadillac unveil split livery in Super Bowl advert\n\nRussell 'wants to go head-to-head' with Verstappen\n\nBarcelona 'shakedown' offers first hints of F1 2026\n\nBiggest rule change ever and Brit teen - what's new in F1 in 2026?",

    "fullText": "Team GB's men's curlers reinforced their credentials as Winter Olympic gold medal favourites in Cortina with a statement 6-3 win over the Swedish rink that consigned them to silver four years ago.\n\nAfter a mismatch against China in their opener, Bruce Mouat and his rink knew they would face a more significant test in their second game. But the Scottish quartet controlled this heavyweight meeting from the outside.\n\nMouat has beaten Niklas Edin in eight of their last 10 meetings, and the Swede could not disturb that trend high in the Dolomites in northern Italy.\n\nIt continued the Scot's recovery from his mixed doubles medal disappointment and leaves the Swedes - who lost their opener against the hosts and face another medal contender in Canada next - in a perilous position.\n\nSeven wins from the nine round-robin matches will guarantee a place in the semi-finals - fewer may well still be sufficient - and the British rink have started well in the race to reach that mark.\n\n\"All four of us were really shooting well,\" Mouat told BBC Sport. \"We've not trained together for a month so to come back and the flow to be where we want it to be is excellent.\"\n\nThe men are back on the ice on Friday, in what should be another top-tier contest against the Italians at 08:05 GMT - live on the BBC.\n\nBefore then, the GB women's rink will start their campaign against world bronze medallists China at 18:05.\n\nHow Team GB is leading the way in curling's arms race\n\n'Don't be afraid of being different, it's your superpower'\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nSwedish skip Edin is considered one of the greatest to have played the game, and comes alive in the Olympic arena. But Mouat and his boys have had his number since Bejing and that agonising extra-end defeat in the 2022 Games.\n\nThese two are arguably the best rinks in the competition, with the Canadians, Italians and Swiss also likely to be in the medal conversation, and this was a high-grade contest.\n\nHowever, Mouat, Hammy McMillan, Bobby Lammie and Grant Hardie won the hammer - the right to throw last and, in theory, control the game - and dictated from there on.\n\nEdin failed to pull off a high-tarriff double takeout in the first end, allowing Mouat to claim two points and establish a lead that the GB rink would keep throughout.\n\nMissing became a theme for the feted Swedish skip, the 40-year-old repeatedly failing to ask the questions that Mouat posed. As a result, the British team led 4-1 at halfway, and eked that advantage out to 6-2 with three ends remaining.\n\nSweden needed something big but could only find something small. They were restricted to one in the eighth and Edin decided he had had enough, offering a hand to Mouat and ending this contest with two ends to spare.\n\n\"Everyone keeps reminding us they beat us in Beijing so we had that motivation,\" Hardie told BBC Sport. \"They had an off-day and we took advantage of that.\n\n\"We were quite relentless - all four of us were near the top of our games - and we made them play shots they didn't want to play.\"\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "The biggest controversy of the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics came to a head on Thursday morning, as Ukraine's Vladyslav Heraskevych was banned from competing.\n\nHeraskevych, who was his country's flagbearer at the opening ceremony, wished to compete in the men's skeleton while wearing a special helmet featuring artwork depicting Ukrainian athletes killed during the Russian invasion.\n\nBut the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said this contravened the Olympic charter – the rules and bylaws for the organisation of the Games – and informed him on Tuesday that he would not be allowed to compete in the helmet.\n\nAfter two days of discussions in which Heraskevych refused to back down, it was confirmed on Thursday morning that he had been disqualified.\n\nHeraskevych wore the helmet in all his training runs before the competition began and carried it through media mixed zones and in multiple interviews.\n\nBut IOC rules dictated that he would not be allowed to wear it during official competition.\n\nThey cited rule 40.2 of the Olympic Charter, external, which states: \"All competitors, team officials or other team personnel in the Olympic Games shall enjoy freedom of expression in keeping with the Olympic values and the fundamental principles of Olympism, and in accordance with the guidelines determined by the IOC Executive Board.\"\n\nThese are the athlete expression guidelines, external, determined in 2023 and which have been codified into Olympic law.\n\nThis states that: \"The focus at the Olympic Games must remain on athletes' performances, sport and the harmony that the games seek to advance.\n\n\"It is a fundamental principle that sport at the Olympic Games is neutral and must be separate from political, religious and any other type of interference. Specifically, the focus on the field of play during competitions and official ceremonies must be on celebrating athletes' performances.\"\n\nThey say athletes can express their views during Olympic Games when speaking to the media, on social media, and on the field of play at the start of competition or during their introduction.\n\nHowever, they forbid these expressions during medal ceremonies, during competition and in the Olympic village.\n\nIf these rules are broken, participants \"may be subject to the IOC's disciplinary proceedings.\"\n\nThe IOC said these changes have been agreed after consultation with 4,500 athletes – stating that the focus on the field of play must be on the sport.\n\nIt was initially erroneously claimed by the IOC that it was rule 50 - which states that \"no kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites\" - that resulted in the disqualification.\n\nIOC president Kirsty Coventry visited Heraskevych and his father in Cortina at 7.30am on the morning of competition, to make a last-gasp plea for him to not wear the helmet.\n\nShe said they had a lengthy, respectful meeting – but ultimately no compromise could be reached.\n\n\"No-one is disagreeing with the messaging. The messaging is a powerful message of remembrance, it's a message of memory, and no-one is disagreeing with that,\" Coventry told the media.\n\n\"What I proposed to him this morning and to his dad - because he also said when he goes down it's blurry, you can't really see it - so I said: 'Could we find a solution where we pay homage to his message, to his helmet before he races, then as soon as he's finished racing going into the mixed zone where you can see the pictures?'\n\n\"Sadly, we've not been able to come to that solution. I really wanted to see him race today. It's been an emotional morning.\"\n\nCoventry was seen to be in tears after leaving the meeting. A former Olympian herself, she won two gold medals in swimming for Zimbabwe.\n\nThe IOC have also reinstated Heraskevych's accreditation, allowing him to stay around the Games and in the Olympic village for the remainder of the competition.\n\nIn a tense media conference on Thursday morning, IOC spokesperson Mark Adams defended their decision to ban Heraskevych.\n\nAdams said that if they allowed athletes to wear kit commemorating those killed in war, it would open the Games to exploitation.\n\n\"There are according to the Red Cross, 130 conflicts going on at any one time,\" he said. \"We can't have them all in competition with each other at the Games.\n\n\"The field of play could become a field of expression, you could see it would lead to chaos. We cannot have athletes have pressure put on them by political masters to make expressions during competition.\n\n\"We do our best to create a level playing field, I make no apologies for that.\"\n\nAdams also denied that the IOC had been pressured by the Russian Olympic Committee or government to ban Heraskevych.\n\nHeraskevych meanwhile has made an urgent appeal against the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).\n\nCAS can hold ad-hoc committees during the Games, meaning his appeal will be heard immediately - although BBC Sport understands there is currently no timeframe for a decision.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nThe decision to ban Heraskevych has drawn shock and condemnation from many former and current Olympic athletes.\n\nLizzy Yarnold, Team GB's two-time Olympic skeleton gold medallist, told BBC Sport: \"I think it is actually quite shocking. Within the sliding community there is shock and confusion.\n\n\"This [wearing the helmet] was a reaction to something which was an act of memorial and incredibly emotionally important to him.\n\n\"I think the IOC owe him an apology and this was the wrong decision.\"\n\nTwo-time Olympic bobsledder John Jackson was equally unimpressed with the IOC.\n\nJackson, who also served as a Royal Marines commando, told the BBC: \"His approach to that is about remembering those who have fallen.\n\n\"For me, being military and now a veteran, remembrance is really important to all veterans. We have all lost friends and colleagues in conflict, and we all know someone who isn't here and paid the ultimate sacrifice.\n\n\"I support him in what he was trying to achieve. It is really important to remember those who have given their life for something that ultimately doesn't need to happen.\"\n\nHeraskevych meanwhile told the BBC that being banned only left him feeling \"emptiness.\"\n\n\"Yesterday and before yesterday I was training good. I could be among the medallists for this event, but suddenly because of some interpretation of the rules that I do not agree with, I am not able to compete,\" he said.\n\n\"Expression guidelines - what do you consider as expression? Many others here in this arena have helmets with different colours and I believe that is also a kind of expression.\n\n\"Some others had national symbols, that is also expression. For some reason, their helmets weren't checked and they were allowed to compete but I am not.\n\n\"I believe they [those who have fallen] deserve to be here because of their sacrifice. I want to honour them and their families.\"\n\nHeraskevych's international team mates showed their support throughout Thursday's competition in Italy.\n\nAlpine skier Dmytro Shepiuk displayed a note reading \"Ukrainian heroes with us\" after competing, while luger Olena Smaha also voiced support for Heraskevych wearing a glove reading: \"Remembrance is not a violation.\"\n\nUkraine president Volodymyr Zelensky accused the IOC of \"playing into the hands of the Russian aggressor\" after Heraskevych's disqualification\n\n\"Sport shouldn't mean amnesia, and the Olympic movement should help stop wars, not play into the hands of aggressors,\" he wrote on X, external.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the decision of the International Olympic Committee to disqualify Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych says otherwise.\"\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "title": "Tuchel deal delights FA - but timing has echoes of Capello decision",
    "description": "The FA is celebrating England head coach Thomas Tuchel's new deal as a coup - but the timing revives memories of its Fabio Capello blunder, says chief football writer Phil McNulty.",
    "fullText": "Thomas Tuchel's contract extension as England head coach will be celebrated as a coup by the Football Association, but comes with complications and a worrying precedent.\n\nOn the one hand, the FA can congratulate itself at securing the services of the elite coach who flawlessly guided England to World Cup qualification on a deal stretching to Euro 2028.\n\nThe timing of Tuchel's new deal is intriguing, a move designed to tie down the 52-year-old German who oversaw England's route to this summer's showpiece, as well as avoiding any distractions around his future.\n\nWhether the latter strategy is successful remains to be seen, and must also largely hinge on whether England justify their status as one of the World Cup favourites.\n\nAt first glance, it represents a good day's work by the FA, and indeed Tuchel, whose contract was scheduled to end after the World Cup, when some of biggest jobs in Europe may well be available.\n\nManchester United, for one, will have had Tuchel firmly in their thoughts as they decide on the long-term successor to Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford. Others may have mirrored their interest.\n\nThe FA will believe Tuchel's decision to commit to England heads off any future interest from elsewhere. The obvious delight is understandable.\n\nAnd yet it begs the question, why now? Why not wait until after England's World Cup campaign?\n\nThis is why Capello's name has been instantly, and justifiably, attached as a rider to the mood of satisfaction around the announcement.\n\nThe Italian was handed a lucrative new deal by the then power-brokers at the FA virtually as England's plane prepared to take off for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.\n\nCapello's name had been conveniently linked with a host of top clubs in Europe, which saw the FA react - perhaps prompted by panic - with an improved contract, which was designed to take him through to Euro 2012.\n\nIt was a move that backfired horribly as England performing badly in South Africa, going out to Germany in the last 16.\n\nCapello and the FA were then stuck with each other in a loveless alliance that ended in February 2012, when the Italian took issue with the decision to strip John Terry of the captaincy.\n\nNeither party appeared to harbour any regrets about the separation.\n\nTuchel's immediate predecessor Sir Gareth Southgate even referenced Capello's ill-starred new deal in his book when there was talk of his contract being extended after Euro 2024.\n\nSouthgate wrote: \"I remembered Fabio Capello signing a new contract ahead of the 2010 World Cup and getting lambasted, actually putting the team under more pressure.\"\n\nThis is a different FA to 16 years ago and there is no suggestion Tuchel's new contract is anything other than a union of two parties delirously happy with each other, but there is certainly currency in the argument that the Capello affair must act as a cautionary tale.\n\nFA CEO Mark Bullingham said: \"We have taken away the potential distraction of contract negotiations around the tournament.\"\n\nWould contract negotiations actually even take place around a tournament when the sole focus must surely be on the World Cup games?\n\nTuchel, befitting a coach of his record and reputation, has guided England through smooth waters to the World Cup, his team blossoming as the qualifying campaign took shape, while he looked more comfortable with every game.\n\nEight wins. No goals conceded. Perfection.\n\nHe has proved to be unflinchingly his own man, especially with his decision-making around Jude Bellingham, leaving Real Madrid's superstar out of England's squad for the friendly with Wales and the World Cup qualifier against Latvia in October despite his desire to be included after injury.\n\nTuchel is laser-focused on his task, which is solely to win the World Cup. No star system, a fault of predecessors, will be employed.\n\nOn the surface this looks, as the saying goes, a \"no brainer\".\n\nBut what if England mirror the desperate efforts of Capello's team in 2010?\n\nIt would take some doing, but they have not been dealt the easiest hand if they get out of the group games in the United States unscathed.\n\nIf all does not go as hoped for, the new contract will weigh heavily on both the FA and Tuchel.\n\nWill this contract development future-proof Tuchel and the FA against World Cup failure? Unlikely.\n\nEngland have made a habit of progressing serenely through qualifying under a succession of managers. Competitive tournament football remains the acid test - and one Tuchel is yet to pass.\n\nIt may, at least, offer the FA some protection from covetous advances being made in Tuchel's direction from elite clubs, something which cannot be discounted should England's World Cup be a success.\n\nTuchel will also be diverting from his own history if he does stay as England head coach until the proposed date of 2028, making his tenure almost four years.\n\nHe has not been one for the long haul since spending five years in charge at Mainz 05 between 2009 and 2014.\n\nTuchel left Borussia Dortmund in May 2017 after two years in charge. He stayed a little longer at Paris St Germain, taking them to the Champions League final, before he was sacked in December 2020.\n\nHe won the Champions League with Chelsea in 2021 but was dismissed in September 2022 after only 20 months in charge. Tuchel was then at Bayern Munich for a little more than a year, winning the Bundesliga.\n\nThis may yet be a brilliant piece of foresight by the FA to keep one of the best, most single-minded, successful coaches in world football.\n\nThe final verdict, however, must wait until after the World Cup.\n\nTuchel extends deal with England\n\nPlayers need social skills for World Cup - Tuchel",

    "description": "The Manchester United co-owner previously said the UK had been \"colonised\" by immigrants.",
    "fullText": "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has apologised for \"offending some people\" with his language after saying the UK had been \"colonised by immigrants\", but maintained an \"open debate\" on the matter was needed.\n\nThe billionaire co-owner of Manchester United had faced criticism from Sir Keir Starmer, who described his comments on Wednesday as \"offensive and wrong\".\n\nOn Thursday, Sir Jim said: \"I am sorry that my choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe and caused concern but it is important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth.\"\n\nThe club has not directly addressed the remarks, but said it \"prides itself\" on being \"inclusive\".\n\n\"Our diverse group of players, staff and global community of supporters, reflect the history and heritage of Manchester; a city that anyone can call home,\" the club said in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\"Manchester United reflects the unity and resilience of all the communities we are so privileged to represent.\n\n\"We will continue to represent our people, our city and our fans with purpose and pride.\"\n\nSources told BBC Sport that the FA is examining whether Sir Jim's comments brought the game into disrepute.\n\nShould the FA formally investigate Sir Jim's comments and choose to charge the 73-year-old under its own rules, he could face further punishment.\n\nHis earlier comments to Sky News had drawn criticism from Manchester United fan groups. He said: \"You can't have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in.\n\n\"I mean, the UK has been colonised. It's costing too much money. The UK has been colonised by immigrants, really, hasn't it?\"\n\nHe incorrectly claimed the population of the UK had risen by 12 million to 70 million people in the last five years. The Office for National Statistics estimates it has actually risen from 66.7 million to 69.4 million, an increase of less than three million.\n\nA Downing Street spokesperson said it was \"absolutely right\" that Sir Jim had apologised for his language.\n\nFollowing the billionaire's comments to the broadcaster, the prime minister's spokesman said Sir Keir thought they were \"offensive and wrong\" and it is \"absolutely right\" he apologised.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister David Lammy said \"a lot of people find that language offensive\".\n\nHe added the government has \"done a lot to bear down\" on small boats and there is \"lots we need to do on irregular migration\".\n\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage previously pushed back against Sir Keir, saying: \"Britain has undergone unprecedented mass immigration that has changed the character of many areas in our country.\"\n\nFollowing the apology, he told BBC's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson podcast the comments were \"accurate and right\", if you \"take the word colonise out\".\n\n\"And what Jim is saying is that mass migration has done us harm and made us poorer. And I think he's absolutely right,\" Farage said.\n\nGreater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said Sir Jim's comments \"go against everything for which Manchester has traditionally stood\".\n\n\"Footballers who have arrived from all over the world to play in Greater Manchester have enhanced the life of our city region.\"\n\nCriticism of Sir Jim's remarks also came in from football groups.\n\nAnti-discrimination campaign group Kick It Out called them \"disgraceful and deeply divisive\", while anti-racism charity Show Racism the Red Card said it was \"deeply concerned\".\n\n\"Language of this kind echoes narratives that have historically been used to stigmatise migrant communities, fuel division, and legitimise hostility towards minority groups,\" it said in a statement.\n\n\"Football clubs and their leadership hold enormous cultural influence.\"\n\nRatcliffe, one of Britain's richest individuals, founded one of the world's largest chemical companies, Ineos.\n\nIn 2020, he reportedly moved from the UK to Monaco, which does not collect personal income tax or capital gains taxes.\n\nHe acquired a 27.7% stake in Man Utd in 2024, and has since restructured the organisation, making 450 redundancies, overhauling senior management and sacking two managers.\n\nHe campaigned for a Leave vote in the 2016 European Union referendum.\n\nAhead of the 2024 general election, he told Bloomberg he had \"had enough\" of the Tories, putting his support instead behind Labour.",

    "fullText": "Fabio Capello has urged Inter Milan not to take anything for granted despite steering eight points clear at the top of the Serie A table.\n\nSpeaking to Gazzetta dello Sport via FCInter1908, Capello insisted that the Scudetto race is not over yet by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nDespite suffering four defeats in the opening 12 league rounds, Inter have hit the ground running under new boss Cristian Chivu.\n\nIndeed, the San Siro giants have secured 11 wins from their last 12 top-flight outings, barring a 2-2 home draw against Napoli in January.\n\nTherefore, they’ve moved eight points clear of second-placed AC Milan.\n\nHowever, Massimiliano Allegri’s men still have a game in hand.\n\nFurthermore, unlike Inter, Milan are not having commitments in other competitions and can focus entirely on winning the Scudetto.\n\nAs such, Capello believes Inter would be naive to let their current lead tuck them into a false sense of security.\n\n“The Italian league isn’t decided yet,” Capello. “I heard Antonio Conte’s words after the penalty defeat against Como the day before yesterday.\n\n“And I think they were a reaction to the loss. ‘Don’t talk to me about the Scudetto; we are nine points behind Inter, and we have serious problems.’\n\n“The Napoli coach expressed a very negative view, but there are still many matches to play, including several head-to-head clashes.\n\n“Calm down… I don’t mean to suggest that Inter isn’t playing well – that’s beyond question – but there’s still a lot to do before you can declare the league over.\n\n“After a defeat, everything looks dark.\n\n“I understand Conte, and it’s hard to stay positive, especially seeing that the Nerazzurri are showing no cracks and seem to be on the right path.\n\n“However, Cristian Chivu’s team still has to be very careful.\n\n“That’s because of the direct confrontations and the six teams – including Como – competing for Champions League spots.\n\n“I also believe there may be a disconnect between what Conte says and what he truly thinks, because claiming the opposite – that the league is open – right after a Coppa Italia defeat would have sent the wrong message.\n\n“Everyone thinks Inter are the favorites.\n\n“Given how they play and how they approach every game with top quality and maximum concentration, they are indeed in a strong position.\n\n“However, the Nerazzurri still have the cups to play for, unlike Napoli and Milan, for example. And that’s not a trivial detail.”",

    "fullText": "Marc Cucurella has been an absolute soldier for Chelsea in the last two years, playing a crazy number of games in a really demanding position.\n\nThe addition of Jorrel Hato this summer was supposed to help him out, but the Dutchman has not proved himself reliable yet, and time again Chelsea have to turn to Cucurella.\n\nThe pressure on his body finally told against Leeds on Tuesday night, when he was taken off with a hamstring problem. In an update in his press conference yesterday, Liam Rosenior said that the club were still awaiting scans to see how bad the damage was.\n\nMarc Cucurella looks sad. (Photo by Clive Mason/Getty Images)\n\nSigns from Spain aren’t good. Joaquin Marota reports for AS that the Spanish football federation are “worried” about a potential muscular problem, with the World Cup closing in.\n\nThey say that the full back will have an MRI today to discover the full extent of the damage. The Spaniard has already been ruled out of tomorrow’s FA Cup game, and even in the best case it feels likely that he misses the league game a week after that too. That gives him two and a half weeks to try and recover to face Arsenal on March 1st.\n\nAtletico Madrid have been linked with a summer move for Pedro Neto, but at the moment the main transfer sources are saying that’s unlikely. We certainly don’t see the reported £80m price as realistic – although if it was, Chelsea would have a hard time saying no to such a profit.\n\nOne player taking a fair bit of flak recently has been Alejandro Garnacho. Fans want to see more, and Liam Rosenior has even been forced to defender him pretty openly in recent press conferences.",

Always grateful I was able to be a part of this team and system,” tweeted the former New Orleans Saint.\n\n“We showed the NFL how valuable a TE truly can be when he’s used as a matchup.”\n\nA genuine case can be made for Jimmy Graham to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nGraham’s prime with the New Orleans Saints is comparable to any tight end in NFL history, including Travis Kelce.\n\nIn the 2011 season, Graham had 99 receptions for 1,310 yards and 11 touchdowns and made his first of five Pro Bowl appearances.\n\nTwo years later, he led the league with 16 touchdown receptions, four more than Kelce has ever had in a single season.\n\nGraham’s main problem is that he did not have the longevity you would expect from a Hall of Famer.\n\nGraham’s prime only lasted six years (2011-2017), whereas most Hall of Famers sustained decade-long excellence.\n\nSeahawks HC Mike Macdonald claps back at Druski over Jaxon Smith-Njigba joke\n\nMyles Garrett went to Italy to support girlfriend Chloe Kim at Winter Olympics after winning DPOY\n\nSeattle Seahawks Super Bowl LX parade draws almost 1 million people in celebration",

    "fullText": "Journalist Federica Zille has come to the defence of Juventus head coach Luciano Spalletti, who kissed her live on TV while trying to make his point during a post-match interview after Juventus’s recent 2-2 draw against Lazio in Serie A.\n\nDuring the 2-2 draw between Juventus and Lazio, Teun Koopmeiners saw his opening goal ruled out by VAR due to Khephren Thuram standing in an offside position. There was also, however, an apparent foul on Juve’s Juan Cabal by Biancocelesti defender Mario Gila in the build-up, which refereeing analyst Luca Marelli argued should have been a penalty.\n\nThis led Spalletti to debate the technicalities of contact in the penalty area during his post-match interview after full-time.\n\nTURIN, ITALY – FEBRUARY 08: Juventus FC head coach Luciano Spalletti looks on during the Serie A match between Juventus FC and SS Lazio at Allianz Stadium on February 8, 2026 in Turin, Italy. (Photo by Valerio Pennicino/Getty Images)\n\n“The referee can interpret it the way he wants, because the defender is imprudent when going into that sliding tackle, so he takes a risk. I am not here to say if it is a penalty or not. He could’ve run back onto the ball, but I would take a wider view,” Spalletti said.\n\n“Everyone now goes to protest about the rules, but there is always an interpretation. The pressure of a step on foot, handball that nobody sees in the stadium but they zoom in with the camera, it is all open to interpretation. You cannot generalise that every contact is a penalty.”\n\nSpalletti then turned back to an incident in a previous game against Atalanta when a penalty was awarded for handball that even Ederson, who had made the cross, hadn’t noticed.\n\n“I never talked about referees when decisions went against me or in favour. In the game against Atalanta the VAR called the referee to view the handball a minute and a half later, when nobody including Raffaele Palladino who was right next to me on the touchline, had any idea what this was even for.\n\n“The rules are too rigid right now, it is the rigidity that I find to be the problem. If nobody even realises it hit a hand, who is damaged by that? The analysts keep saying ‘there was contact,’ but that doesn’t mean anything, does it? May I kiss you, here, this is contact,” said Spalletti when giving the female interviewer, Zille, a peck on the cheek.\n\n“It’s about context, contact is not the same thing as impact. There will always be difficulty if there are rules where every touch of the hand is a penalty, every step on foot is a penalty. This is what VAR is for, you can evaluate the context in its totality.\n\n“If we stick to the rules, then that is definitely a penalty, because Gila goes into a sliding tackle and takes responsibility for that gesture when he doesn’t get the ball.”\n\nBERGAMO, ITALY – FEBRUARY 05: Luciano Spalletti, Head Coach of Juventus, looks on prior to the Coppa Italia Quarter-Final match between Atalanta BC and Juventus FC at the New Balance Arena on February 05, 2026 in Bergamo, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nZille, who was on duty with DAZN for the Juventus-Lazio match, has since come out to defend Spalletti, following some accusations of improper behaviour during his post-match interview.\n\nSpeaking to FantacalcioTV (via corriere.it), Zille said: “There was no kind of malice in Spalletti’s gesture. He wanted to exemplify what he was saying, that there is a difference between contact and impact.\n\n“I know Spalletti. Many say ‘he wouldn’t have done that had it been a man’. No, he probably would have touched or nudged a man to say that it was just contact and not a foul.\n\n“I wouldn’t like for people to talk about malice or a lack of respect in this situation, for me as a woman, as a journalist or as a professional.\n\n“I’ve read comments which have mentioned the word ‘harassment’. I’ve found that to be really exaggerated, perhaps even incorrect because harassment is a serious topic. And as a woman, I feel strongly about this issue, but that’s all the more reason to have clarity of mind and give the right balance to this sort of thing.”",

    "fullText": "In the normal WNBA calendar, February is generally a good time to check in on the state of the draft. The college season is about three-fourths complete, allowing for ample scouting of the domestic prospects. The European and Australian seasons are in full swing as well for international prospects.\n\nOf course, this isn’t a normal WNBA offseason. The college and international seasons have proceeded according to plan, but without a new CBA, there has been no free agency and not a single trade since the Nov. 23 draft lottery, when The Athletic published its first mock draft of this season. As a result, the draft order is the same as it was in November — it actually remains undecided, as we still don’t know where in the 15-team order expansion teams will select.\n\nNevertheless, enough time has passed and enough has changed in the evaluation of this year’s class to warrant another mock draft. Expect a lot more movement once the WNBA’s offseason begins in earnest.\n\nDallas should be the biggest winner of 2026 free agency. With the league’s newest superstar Paige Bueckers under contract and a practice facility scheduled to open in April, the Wings have two enormous carrots to dangle in front of the league’s best players, and as has been repeated ad nauseam, almost every veteran in the WNBA is available to change teams. If all goes according to plan, this is the last time Dallas will be drafting in the lottery in the foreseeable future. As a result, the Wings should take a big swing, and that swing is Awa Fam.\n\nThe 19-year-old is a fantastic athlete and already shows veteran instincts on the defensive end. Her upside as a rim protector and play finisher is the highest in the class. It’s worth noting her offense hasn’t exactly popped in EuroLeague, as she’s averaging seven points and less than six rebounds this season. But Fam is still playing more than 20 minutes per game against the highest level of European competition and holding her own as a teenager. That usually bodes well for WNBA prospects.\n\nThe length of Awa Fam has been evident in some brief 1Q moments vs Estepona, but there’s this one:\n\n– able to block Sika Kone (W-level player) after a slip & finish attempt https://t.co/UpvqFv15st pic.twitter.com/TkbeCnprrV\n\n— Alford Corriette (@alfcorriette) February 7, 2026\n\nWNBA talent evaluators have been waiting five years to see Azzi Fudd healthy and playing consistently. The UConn guard has finally delivered in her super senior season. She has played every game and is averaging career-bests in points (17.4), assists (3.0) and steals (2.4). She is also shooting the absolute leather off the ball. Even after a relative slump during January, Fudd is making 53 percent of her 2s and 45 percent of her 3s. She doesn’t get to the line much but is near automatic when she does, missing only two free throws all season.\n\nFudd still doesn’t project as a No. 1 scoring option. Her handle is a little limited, and she has used only eight percent of her possessions in isolation or as a pick-and-roll ballhandler, per Synergy. But she is particularly valuable as a spot-up threat in the half court and in transition with her high, steady release, and she is equally excellent coming off screens and handoffs. Fudd has also been a high-impact defender. She is an easy fit on any roster, especially a franchise that has historically valued Huskies products.\n\nMiles’ drop from my last mock draft has little to do with her own production and more to do with Fudd’s ascent. In her first season at TCU, Miles has been as dominant as ever running the show, even with an entirely new set of teammates. She can make every read and every pass in the halfcourt and in transition, and when defenses play her as a scorer, Miles gets to the rim and scores efficiently. The swing skill with Miles was her 3-point shooting, and though she hasn’t been as productive as she was in 2024-25 at Notre Dame, she is still making 35.2 percent of her triples and 39 percent of her catch-and-shoot attempts. Considering Miles has also improved her free-throw percentage to 85.2 percent, her jumper should be plenty good enough for the pro level and force defenders to stay honest with her on the perimeter.\n\nThe main drawback with Miles is her lack of defensive playmaking, but that’s less important at point guard than at any other position. Her turnover rate is also a smidge high; however, that’s the creativity tax for her audacious passing.\n\nThe Mystics hope to have their center of the future in Shakira Austin. In his most recent public comments, Washington president Michael Winger said as much while acknowledging the uncertainty of her future as a restricted free agent. “I love Kira, I foresee her being a part of this team for a long time,” he said. “She’ll have the opportunity to explore her options. I hope that we are an attractive option for her.”\n\nIf Austin chooses to move on, what a great opportunity to reunite what should have been the latest in a long line of dominant Stanford frontcourt duos. Betts and Kiki Iriafen only played one season together in Palo Alto — and Betts barely saw the floor as a freshman — but their games have grown to complement each other. Iriafen has a smooth face-up game, and Betts thrives without the ball in her hands as a screener and on put-backs. While Iriafen can cover more mobile forwards and even perimeter players, Betts is a dominant paint defender, arguably the best rim protector in college basketball; opponents shoot 13 percent worse at the rim when Betts is in the game, per CBB Analytics.\n\nSydney Johnson developed the Mystics’ identity as a defensive team in his first season in Washington. With cornerstones already on the wing (Sonia Citron) and at power forward, Betts is another strong defensive piece to add to the young core.\n\nThe goal of this exercise wasn’t to recreate great college teams of recent memory, but it is a happy accident. Flau’jae Johnson could pair with not one, but two former LSU teammates in Chicago: Angel Reese and Hailey Van Lith. More importantly, the Sky need a perimeter shot creator.\n\nJohnson’s usage has decreased with the Tigers’ increased depth this season, but her efficiency is as good as ever. She gets such good lift on her jumper and excels off screens and as a spot-up shooter. Johnson is a force on the offensive glass, especially for her position. It’s a little concerning that she still isn’t LSU’s No. 1 option as a senior, but her Tigers keep winning, and she finds a way to help them find success no matter the surrounding context. Seeing Johnson under a coach who prioritizes offensive initiation from the wings would be interesting.\n\nThis is probably too high for a role player, even one as highly regarded as Jaquez. At some point, I might have to course correct. But everyone I’ve spoken to in the WNBA loves Jaquez. She can play multiple positions. She shoots well (62.9 percent on 2s, 43.8 percent on 3s and 87.5 percent on free throws), moves off the ball — UCLA scores a ridiculous 1.47 points per possession off of her cuts, per Synergy — and defends.\n\nEvery time Jaquez takes the floor, she seems to get a little better. If you’re building a culture from the ground up, you couldn’t do better than opting for the life Jaquez breathes into a program.\n\nThis is another pick that hasn’t changed since November. After winning the EuroLeague’s young player of the year award last season, Martín is averaging 12.5 points and 5.2 assists in EuroCup games in 2025-26. That would have been a top 10 assist mark among qualified players in the WNBA last season. Her team is 9-1 in those contests with a 20-year-old running point. Martín’s 3-point percentage has dropped 10 percent since last season, but her free-throw percentage has gone up by a similar margin to 82.8.\n\nThe French wave is inevitable. After the rapid success of Dominique Malonga and Leïla Lacan, there’s much less skepticism about French prospects and how they perceive the WNBA. France is developing an incredible generation of talent, and if those players want to come to the U.S., the WNBA is more than happy to have them.\n\nIt should come as little surprise that a foreign player is mocked to Golden State after the Valkyries rostered 10 internationals over the course of their debut season. Angloma is on the come-up thanks to a prolific scoring season in France’s top league. Opponents can’t stop Angloma from getting to the basket, even though she doesn’t have much of a jump shot. She’s averaging 16.2 points per game and earning 6.1 free-throw attempts per contest. At 19, she already has the physicality to survive in the league, though her jumper will have to improve to make her a viable shooting guard or small forward.\n\nKneepkens led the Big 12 in effective field-goal percentage and free-throw percentage last season, making 57 percent of her 2s, 45 percent of her 3s and 89 percent of her foul shots. Since transferring to UCLA, she has become even more efficient from every area. Kneepkens is simply one of the best shooters college basketball has seen in recent years, no matter her usage. The Bruins improve their effective field-goal percentage by 7.6 percent when Kneepkens is on the floor.\n\nShe uses an unorthodox form on her jump shot, but after five seasons in three conferences, there is enough of a track record to believe it will translate to the professional level. The Mystics took and made the fewest 3s in the WNBA in 2025. Bringing in an ace shooter like Kneepkens is a quick way to fix that.\n\nLeger-Walker is the second-best pure point guard in this class behind Miles, though her age (she turns 25 in September) limits her upside relative to Martín. Nevertheless, she knows how to run an offense and makes a mean skip pass. She’s also a bully on drives and has become a surprisingly good screen navigator on defense at UCLA after being a more inattentive defender during her Washington State days.\n\nAll of those attributes make her a useful complement to Caitlin Clark. Leger-Walker can give Clark opportunities to play off the ball, letting the Fever star come off screens and function as a movement shooter instead of having to bring the ball up and do all of the shot creation. Leger-Walker’s passing craft rivals Clark’s, allowing her to mimic some of Clark’s sets as a backup point guard.\n\nIndiana is trying to win now, and Leger-Walker has as much experience as possible for a rookie. In addition to her six years of college basketball, she has been playing for the New Zealand national team since age 16.\n\nKiki Rice has been the starting point guard for UCLA for four seasons, and I’m still uncertain if she can be a point guard in the pros. But the WNBA is trending more positionless; not every team needs a classic floor general if they have playmaking at other positions. And regardless of Rice’s position, she has enough certainties in her game. She defends the point of attack (she has the second-best defensive on-off differential for the Bruins behind Betts), she puts pressure on the rim, and she holds herself accountable. Rice shot 21.7 from 3-point range and 79.1 percent from the foul line as a freshman; those figures are 40 percent and 89.5 percent as a senior. Bring Rice home to D.C. and let her continue to improve through Washington’s rebuild.\n\nAnother balanced attack last night, 4️⃣ Bruins finished in double figures! #GoBruins pic.twitter.com/iF2e6k6fxk\n\n— UCLA Women’s Basketball (@UCLAWBB) February 10, 2026\n\nThe Sun have a ton of defensive talent on the perimeter with Lacan and Saniya Rivers. They don’t have much offensive pop. Let Latson change that. The adjustment to South Carolina has been a bit more uneven than Latson or the Gamecocks might have hoped, but she is still a fearsome scorer and dynamic downhill attacker; 47.4 percent of her shot attempts come within 4.5 feet of the rim, and she earns 5.8 free-throw attempts per game. Connecticut will have to find some stretch bigs to accommodate spacing challenges at other positions, but Latson will insist her way to the basket no matter who else is on the floor. The Sun could desperately use that type of player.\n\nThe Dream are building around Rhyne Howard, Allisha Gray and Naz Hillmon, and that trio needs an organizing force at point guard. That’s Raven Johnson. She controls pace, knows how to get all of her teammates involved and is loath to hijack possessions when a better option presents itself. She also has consistently helmed great defenses and makes dribbling difficult for opposing guards for 94 feet. If there were any consistency on her jump shot, she’d be a better prospect. Perhaps playing for Karl Smesko and being forced to launch from 3 will improve her confidence in her jumper.\n\nJackson looks like a 3-and-D player — she has a pro body and takes a high volume of 3-pointers, and she does so confidently. The stats don’t totally support that hypothesis, neither the shooting nor the defense, though her 3-pointer was much better in the two seasons before this one. Yet, Jackson has been heavily relied upon by some excellent Duke teams. She makes her foul shots, a rarity for the Blue Devils in the Kara Lawson era. She’s emerged as a valuable playmaker. She holds up well in one-on-one defense and has improved as a screen-and-roll defender as she learns how to navigate those offensive possessions. She has a lot of tools to like, even if the whole package hasn’t quite come together at Duke.\n\nThis pick could go in many directions. In addition to the three players listed below, Grace VanSlooten, Dariana Littlepage-Buggs and Janiah Barker were all considered here. VanSlooten is a personal favorite, but it’s hard to justify picking her when the Sun already have two young power forwards in Aneesah Morrow and Aaliyah Edwards. Ultimately, the spot goes to Okot. She does exactly what you want from a center: seals her defender, protects the paint and boxes out. Okot has shown massive improvement in just two years of college basketball, and she’s young for this class since she won’t turn 22 until August. There is so much room to grow.\n\nAlso considered: Maggie Doogan (Richmond), Tonie Morgan (Kentucky), Laila Phelia (Syracuse)\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nMinnesota Lynx, New York Liberty, Seattle Storm, Los Angeles Sparks, Washington Mystics, Atlanta Dream, Chicago Sky, Connecticut Sun, Indiana Fever, Dallas Wings, Las Vegas Aces, Phoenix Mercury, Duke Blue Devils, UCLA Bruins, South Carolina Gamecocks, TCU Horned Frogs, Connecticut Huskies, LSU Lady Tigers, Golden State Valkyries, Portland Fire, Toronto Tempo, WNBA, Women's College Basketball\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "They battled well against an organised Sunderland side and more than deserved the 1-0 win.\n\nSunderland raced out of the blocks but Liverpool did well to withstand some early pressure and were by far the better side for most of the first half.\n\nThey were comfortable in possession, with Florian Wirtz at the heart of everything, and perhaps the only criticism can be their failure to make that dominance count.\n\nIn the end, it took a set-piece for Arne Slot's side to break the deadlock - with Liverpool's 10th corner of the game resulting in Virgil van Dijk's goal. The Dutchman now has more goals (23) than any other Liverpool defender in the Premier League era.\n\nMohamed Salah's struggles in front of goal are becoming a concern, but he provided his 92nd Premier League assist for Liverpool, moving him level with Steven Gerrard for their most in the competition.\n\nThe fact Sunderland rarely threatened is also testament to Liverpool's defence, which saw two changes as Wataru Endo and Andy Robertson came in for Dominik Szoboszlai and Milos Kerkez.\n\nManchester City are the only other side to have kept a clean sheet at Sunderland this season (a 0-0 draw in January).\n\nLiverpool have not performed like reigning champions often enough this term, but on this wet night in the north east they turned up and delivered a display befitting of that status.",

    "fullText": "According to a report from The Athletic, Liverpool remain hopeful of Ibrahima Konaté (26) signing a new contract with the club. The French international defender’s current deal at Anfield is set to expire at the end of the season, and there is no agreement between the two parties on a new contract.\n\nThe Premier League champions are currently enduring a difficult season domestically, which has seen the form of several key players drop, including the Frenchman at times. However, in recent weeks, the 26-year-old has returned to form. He was key in the Reds’ ending Sunderland’s unbeaten run at the Stadium of Light on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Merseyside outfit believes that the former RB Leipzig defender could follow the same pattern of his teammates in Mohamed Salah and Virgil Van Dijk by signing a new contract at the end of the season. Extending his contract at Anfield is not Konaté’s only option. Real Madrid are also interested in signing him on a free transfer.",

    "fullText": "Geoff Neal has opened up about the personal battles he’s been fighting outside the Octagon.\n\nThe UFC welterweight division remains a mix of fresh faces and experienced names, with several veterans still holding their place in the rankings.\n\nNeal, who debuted in the Octagon nine years ago, is one of those veterans. He’s currently ranked 12th at 170 pounds and continues to be a presence in the division.\n\nWhile he started his UFC career with five straight wins, consistency has been hard to find since then. Neal has dropped five of his last eight fights.\n\nBehind that slide in form was a serious issue away from fighting that Neal was dealing with during that period.\n\nNeal’s last victory came against Rafael dos Anjos in 2024, his only win in four recent outings.\n\nHis bid to build momentum was halted when Carlos Prates stopped him at UFC 319 last August, denying the Texan back-to-back wins for the first time since 2022.\n\nSpeaking to James Lynch of Home of Fight, Neal opened up about the issues that have made consistency hard to come by. The 35-year-old explained how addiction had impacted his preparation, saying he often entered training camps out of shape.\n\n“This is my first time opening up about it, so it’s kind of weird,” Neal said. “I had a problem with addiction: drugs and alcohol. It was rough. It was five years of it.”\n\n“Within that time, the longest I was sober was two weeks, and those two weeks were usually before a fight. I would only slow down two weeks before the fight.”{{INSTAGRAM_PLACEHOLDER_3}}\n\n“I’d come into fights underprepared and out of shape. It was rough,” he added.\n\nLately though, Neal has been making steady progress in his recovery and recently hit a milestone with over three months sober.\n\nHe credits much of his improvement to following principles from ‘75 Hard,’ although he adjusted parts of the program to fit his needs.\n\n“We did more of a 75 Soft. There were certain things, like the reading, I was like, ‘F*ck that’. But most of it I did.\n\nNeal’s next fight isn’t far off, giving him a quick opportunity to get back in the win column following his recent progress away from the Octagon.\n\nHe’s scheduled to face Uros Medic at UFC Houston on February 21, with the bout taking place at the Toyota Center.\n\nThe 32-year-old Serbian has put together two straight first-round finishes over Gilbert Urbina and Muslim Salikhov since that loss. Now, he’ll look to build on that momentum against Neal.\n\nThe matchup offers Medic a shot at cracking the rankings, while Neal will be aiming to prove his form is returning along with his health.\n\nConor McGregor caught joking around with training partner during gym session\n\nFuture Hollywood star made MMA TV history before Ronda Rousey\n\nConor McGregor hails 14-year-old signing as the ‘next golf superstar’ of the world",

They've had world-class managers there and they haven't had success. And for what reason?\n\n\"Thomas is walking in and what's his objective? What's the club's objective?\n\n\"If you're going to do such a major pivot, you've got to understand there's going to be some instability there.\n\n\"Did Thomas know he was walking into that?

    "description": "After just eight games, it’s fair to ask if the former Columbia University math major is having the best-ever season for a US coach in Europe.",
    "fullText": "Pellegrino Matarazzo stood there, still and composed. Brown pants. Black sweater. Arms crossed, one hand to his chin and grey beard. The New Jerseyan looked less like the manager of Real Sociedad, a club that placed in La Liga’s top six for five straight seasons before last year, than a math professor. That’s what he well might have been, had his life taken only a slightly different turn; he graduated from Columbia University with a degree in applied mathematics, after all.\n\nInstead, he was there on Saturday, at the Anoeta Stadium, calmly coaxing his side past Elche, 3-1, pumping a single fist when La Real scored, occasionally waving those arms to push his side further upfield. As if Matarazzo’s being there, as if his team taking yet another lead, was all just a matter of course. Just a big-time manager at a big-time club, doing big-time things.\n\nSince Matarazzo’s appointment on 20 December, La Real have won four of six in La Liga, surging from 16th place to eighth. During that unbeaten run, they have tied Atlético Madrid and regional rivals Athletic Club, and beaten Barcelona, which had won 11 in a row going into that match – and totally dominated Sociedad, it should be said. Matarazzo’s men also advanced through two rounds of the Copa del Rey, and defeated Athletic Club again on Wednesday in the first leg of their semi-final. On Saturday, they travel to Real Madrid.\n\nYet for his stunning early success – Real Sociedad have now won as many league matches in Matarazzo’s seven weeks in charge as they did in the 17 rounds before – the presence of the American remains remarkable.\n\nRather awkwardly, after just eight matches, the question can already be asked whether Matarazzo is quietly putting together the most impressive season a US-born coach has ever recorded in Europe.\n\nThe son of an Italian Napoli fan, Matarazzo tried his luck as a professional in Italy after four years of college soccer at Columbia, where two of his younger brothers played as well – all three of them earning All-Ivy League honors while there. Pellegrino, who goes by Rino, wound up spending a decade in Germany’s lower leagues before becoming a coach. He was Julian Nagelsmann’s roommate during the German federation’s coaching courses and joined the latter on the staff at Hoffenheim. Matarazzo took over as Stuttgart manager in December of 2019 and got them promoted back to the Bundesliga right away. After getting sacked in late 2022, he returned to Hoffenheim as manager but lasted only 18 months.\n\nMatarazzo had been unemployed for more than a year when he suddenly turned up in San Sebastián, becoming the first American to manage in La Liga.\n\nWith an innate intensity and clear tactics that he will not share with the press, the results have come quickly. But Matarazzo has also made himself popular with a studious deference to local culture.\n\n“The first day he came in, the first impression was a bit scary: he’s 6ft 2in and frightening,” captain Mikel Oyarzabal told the Guardian (Matarazzo is actually taller – listed as 6ft 6in). “But he has brought good energy, intensity. We’re on the right path now. He has embraced Donostia, la Real, the Basque Country values from here; coming from the outside, that’s important.”\n\n“The team is very, very special,” Matarazzo said. “I am enjoying this club: the players, the staff. Good characters, great values that I can identify myself with and the city is beautiful too; it’s not a bad place to be right now.”\n\nBut if the American appreciates his good fortune in getting this opportunity, he has also been savvy in his approach. To make himself understood to a team that counts only a few non-native Spanish speakers, Matarazzo speaks as much Spanish as he can muster. But when he speaks in English, he provides subtitles to his team talks in all the languages in the locker room, according to goalkeeper Álex Remiro.\n\nLuck has been a factor, too. “There was a little magic in the atmosphere,” Matarazzo said after his side upset Barça on the eve of tamborrada, San Sebastián’s annual festival.\n\nIn truth, the distinction of the best American coaching campaign in European club soccer is a niche one. That competition isn’t particularly stiff. Bob Bradley had a checkered record in two stints with Stabæk in Norway, at Le Havre in France, and, very briefly and unhappily, in charge of Swansea City of the Premier League. Gregg Berhalter never got Hammarby promoted to the top-tier Allsvenskan.\n\nThe bar to clear is probably the one set by Jesse Marsch in winning back-to-back doubles with Red Bull Salzburg in 2019-20 and 2020-21. But then that Salzburg team was stacked – Erling Haaland scored 28 goals for Marsch in the American’s first half season at the club – and in the middle of a run of 10 straight Austrian league titles. Real Sociedad was in disarray when Matarazzo took over, still smarting from losing Martin Zubimendi to Arsenal last summer.\n\nThere is a lot of season left, of course. While only three points separate La Real from sixth-placed Espanyol, sitting in the final European place, it is also a mere nine points removed from the relegation zone with 15 rounds of games left to go.\n\nIf La Real stays on anything like the trajectory it has been on, however, Matarazzo will lay down a new marker for his countrymen.\n\nLeander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on 12 May.

In his recent post, Diaz reiterated his belief that he launched the concept.\n\n“Let’s not act like I didn’t start a whole division bringing value to all these guys claiming they’re it. I gave opportunity and put notice on the dopest fights I got unfinished business, and I plan on going and taking what’s mine ASAP.”\n\n“First to ever start a division and the dopest one at that. You’re welcome, m————. I’ll see you soon, I’m coming.”\n\nThe message circulated rapidly, adding to ongoing debate about a potential return to the Octagon.\n\nThe BMF belt is currently set to be defended by Max Holloway against Charles Oliveira at UFC 326. Diaz has not fought in the UFC since his contract concluded following a win over Tony Ferguson.\n\nHe has since competed in boxing, including a rematch victory over Masvidal. Dana White has previously indicated Diaz would be welcome back should he decide to rejoin the organisation.\n\nWith his latest statement signalling intent, attention now shifts to whether Diaz will act on his vow to settle unfinished business inside the cage.\n\nConor McGregor vs. Nate Diaz rivalry massively changed Nick Diaz’s life\n\nJon Jones shares honest take on Nate Diaz, dismissing his ‘gangster’ image\n\nNate Diaz slammed as ‘delusional’ for targeting surprising name in UFC return bid",

    "fullText": "The ink isn’t even dry, and the hangovers are barely over for the Seattle Seahawks. They won the Super Bowl. They should be able to enjoy it, right? We know how the NFL works, though. This is and 365 day a 365-day-a-year enterprise, and the grind never stops.\n\nAs the Seahawks look towards the 2026 season, and let’s be honest, that’s already happening, one of the biggest questions is the future of Cooper Kupp.\n\nMORE: NBA Power Rankings ahead of 2026 All-Star Break\n\nFrom a regular-season perspective, Kupp’s first season in Seattle wasn’t great. He finished with just 47 catches for 593 yards and two touchdowns. Kupp wasn’t close to being the same dominating player that he was in his prime with the Los Angeles Rams. While part of that was due to the sheer dominance and overwhelming success of Jaxon Smith-Njigba and the Seattle running game, it was hard not to take note of that.\n\nWith Smith-Njigba dealing with a concussion in the Super Bowl, Kupp stepped up and caught six of 12 targets for 61 yards. It closed out a strong postseason in which he caught 15 passes for 157 yards and a touchdown in three games.\n\nBut with the veteran entering his age-33 season, Seattle has a tough decision to make on Kupp.\n\nHe has a $17.47 million cap hit next season and that comes with $8 million of dead money. While the Seahawks are currently fifth in available cap space at $73 million, releasing Kupp would create a substantial windfall. Seattle is fortunate that Sam Darnold is on an affordable contract for a quarterback, but Kenneth Walker is a free agent, and they can’t ignore the status of their defense.\n\nRashid Shaheed is also a free agent, which means that the Seahawks are thin at the receiver position. But is Kupp the best use of their capital and roster space? He showed this season that he’s not capable of being a true number two receiver, and he’s overpaid to be a third or fourth option. If Kupp is still in Seattle in 2026, it will likely be because his contract was re-done.\n\nOLYMPICS: Norway skier goes viral after displaying insane Winter Olympics speed\n\nSUPER BOWL: Ranking the last 10 NFL Super Bowl champions\n\nMLB: Texas Rangers’ Nolan Ryan jersey giveaway is a bloody mess\n\nMEDIA: Photos of potential suspect in Nancy Guthrie disappearance released by FBI\n\nVIRAL: Norwegian Olympics star makes stunning girlfriend admission after winning bronze medal\n\nThe post Seahawks have a tough decision to make on star player after Super Bowl win appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "title": "Employee Monitoring and SimpleHelp Software Abused in Ransomware Operations",
    "description": "Huntress uncovers ransomware operations abusing employee monitoring software and SimpleHelp RMM for persistence, and ransomware deployment.",
    "fullText": "Special thanks to Tanner Filip, Nick Roddy, Matt Anderson, and Craig Sweeney for their tireless efforts in triaging and iterating on detections for this activity.\n\nNet Monitor for Employees Professional is a commercial workforce monitoring tool developed by NetworkLookout. Marketed for employee productivity tracking, the software provides capabilities that extend well beyond passive screen monitoring, including reverse shell connections, remote desktop control, file management, and the ability to customize service and process names during installation. These features, while designed for legitimate administrative use, make it an attractive tool for threat actors seeking to blend into enterprise environments without deploying traditional malware.\n\nIn late January and early February 2026, the Huntress Tactical Response team observed two separate intrusions in which threat actors chained Net Monitor with SimpleHelp, a legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) platform commonly used by IT teams and managed service providers. Like many RMM tools, SimpleHelp has been increasingly abused by threat actors as a post-exploitation persistence mechanism due to its lightweight agent, support for gateway redundancy, and ability to operate over common ports.\n\nIn the cases observed, threat actors used these two tools together, using Net Monitor for Employees as a primary remote access channel and SimpleHelp as a redundant persistence layer, ultimately leading to the attempted deployment of Crazy ransomware. Shared infrastructure, overlapping IOCs, and consistent tradecraft across both cases strongly suggest a single threat actor or group behind this activity.\n\nDespite its name implying passive monitoring, Net Monitor for Employees Professional bundles a pseudo-terminal (winpty-agent.exe) that enables full command execution. Threat actors leveraged this capability for hands-on-keyboard reconnaissance, additional tooling delivery, and deploying secondary remote access channels, effectively turning an employee monitoring tool into a fully functional RAT (remote access trojan).\n\nThe same filename (vhost.exe) and overlapping C2 infrastructure were reused across both cases, strongly suggesting a single operator or group behind both intrusions.\n\nIn one case, the attack chain culminated in an attempted deployment of Crazy ransomware, with the threat actor dropping multiple copies of the ransomware binary, suggesting previous execution attempts failed.\n\nThe attacker disguised the Net Monitor agent as Microsoft OneDrive, registering the service as OneDriveSvc, naming the process OneDriver.exe, and renaming the running binary to svchost.exe.\n\nThe SimpleHelp agent in case #2 was configured with keyword-based monitoring triggers targeting cryptocurrency wallets, exchanges, blockchain explorers, and payment platforms, indicating the threat actor's financial motivation extends beyond ransomware to direct cryptocurrency theft. The agent also monitored for remote access tool keywords such as RDP, AnyDesk, TeamViewer, and VNC, likely to detect active user sessions on the compromised host.\n\nAt the end of January 2026, Huntress observed a signal alerting us to activity that we’ve seen multiple times - suspicious account manipulation on a host. In this case, some kind of remote access tool was being used to disable the system Guest account:\n\nFigure 1: Screenshot of command line process tree, showing net commands spawned from remote monitoring tool\n\nRemote management software is often used to administer user accounts, but something about this particular instance felt off, so we continued to investigate the affected endpoint. Interestingly, we observed multiple instances of various iterations of net commands—these commands ran the gamut of user enumeration, attempting to reset passwords and create additional user accounts on the host. An attempt at enabling the built-in Administrator account was also observed:\n\nFigure 2: Screenshot of command line process tree, showing net commands spawned from remote monitoring tool\n\nAt this point, it was evident that a piece of software present on the host was exhibiting abnormal and suspicious behavior while facilitating remote access.\n\nSoftware installations do not appear on hosts out of thin air, so the next step in our investigation process was to figure out where and when this particular tool was installed. Typically, tools that facilitate remote access are installed on machines by administrators or are rolled out through tools like Group Policy or InTune. However, in this case, we discovered something out of the ordinary.\n\nLooking at the various process execution events on the host, we noted that the executable winpty-agent.exe was actually spawned from a binary called lsa.exe, which belonged to a tool called “Net Monitor for Employees.”\n\nWhile the name “Net Monitor” may imply passive monitoring, the tool actually bundled a pseudo-terminal application, allowing for command execution. This dynamic blurs the lines between a passive monitoring tool and a fully fledged RMM tool.\n\nFigure 3: Net Monitor for Employees Professional console interface showing remote control, screen monitoring, desktop recording, file management, and terminal access capabilities.\n\nAs we kept pulling on investigative threads, we observed the “Net Monitor for Employees” terminal pulling down a file via PowerShell named vhost.exe from the IP address of 160.191.182[.]41:\n\nFigure 4: Screenshot of command line process tree, showing PowerShell download of a renamed SimpleHelp executable, spawned from remote monitoring tool\n\nVhost.exe turned out to be a SimpleHelp binary, configured to connect to: 192.144.34[.]42\n\nFrom this point, the threat actor proceeded to execute various commands through the SimpleHelp RMM, including attempts at defense evasion via Windows Defender tampering:\n\nFigure 5: Screenshot of attempted Defender tampering via Windows registry modification\n\nFollowing these unsuccessful attempts, we observed the threat actor attempting to deploy multiple versions of “Crazy” ransomware, a variant belonging to the VoidCrypt ransomware family, dropping various binaries named encrypt.exe to disk. In this case, the threat actor made multiple copies of this file: encrypt - Copy (2).exe, encrypt - Copy (3).exe and so forth, suggesting that execution of this binary ran into issues that the threat actor attempted to correct.\n\nPut together, the overall intrusion narrative of this case looked something like:\n\nFigure 6: Timeline illustrating order of events\n\nIn this case, a relatively complete picture of the intrusion was able to be built from limited telemetry, despite incomplete Huntress EDR agent coverage for the victim network.\n\nOne major piece missing from this investigation was the initial access portion: how did the “Net Monitor For Employees” software on this network come to be compromised in the first place? Unfortunately, telemetry to answer these questions was not available for this case. However, this telemetry was available for the second case that we cover below.\n\nIn early February 2026, Huntress Tactical Response team observed a case where a threat actor leveraged a compromised vendor's SSL VPN account to gain initial access to the environment. Upon connecting via Remote Desktop Protocol to a domain controller, the threat actor launched an interactive PowerShell session to begin staging their tooling.\n\nThe threat actor installed the Network Monitor for Employees Professional agent by executing an msiexec command that pulled the installer directly from the Net Monitor for Employees Professional website (networklookout[.]com). The reverse connection was configured to call back to an attacker-controlled console on port 443, using both the domain dronemaker[.]org and its resolved IP address 104.145.210[.]13. To further evade detection, the attacker took advantage of the installer's built-in configuration parameters, which allow customization of service and process names during deployment, to disguise the agent as a legitimate system process. The Windows service was registered under the name OneDriveSvc with a service process name of OneDriver.exe, mimicking Microsoft's OneDrive service. The running process itself was renamed to svchost.exe, a ubiquitous Windows system process.\n\nFigure 7: Huntress process telemetry showing the msiexec command used to silently install the Net Monitor for Employees Professional agent with reverse connection and process masquerading parameters.\n\nShortly after, the threat actor installed SimpleHelp as a service named Remote Access Service under C:\\ProgramData\\JWrapper-Remote Access, establishing an additional persistent remote access channel alongside Net Monitor. On startup, the SimpleHelp agent's JWrapper bootstrap connected to 160.191.182[.]41 to pull updates, downloading version files and JRE components from hxxp://160.191.182[.]41/access/. The agent was configured with five gateway servers for redundancy, cycling through each upon initialization and registering with a consistent session ID. The logs revealed the following gateway connection behavior:\n\nInitially rejected, later accepted after reconfiguration\n\nConsistently rejected throughout\n\nNotably, dronemaker[.]org appears as both a Net Monitor C2 and a SimpleHelp gateway.\n\nUnlike Case #1, in this case, we had access to some Net Monitor telemetry, and could see the interaction with the renamed SimpleHelp binary. Interestingly, the very same vhost.exe file name was used:\n\nFigure 8: Log entry from Net Monitor for Employees Professional showing download of renamed SimpleHelp RMM\n\nInterestingly enough, the SimpleHelp agent was also configured with keyword-based monitoring triggers via GlobalEvents, revealing the threat actor's financial motivation. The logs show the agent continuously cycling through trigger and reset events for cryptocurrency-related keywords, including wallet services (metamask, exodus, wallet, blockchain), exchanges (binance, bybit, kucoin, bitrue, poloniex, bc.game, noones), blockchain explorers (etherscan, bscscan), and the payment platform payoneer. Alongside these, the agent also monitored for remote access tool keywords, including RDP, anydesk, ultraview, teamview, and VNC, likely to detect if anyone was actively connecting to the machine. These triggers fired repeatedly in rapid succession, suggesting they were configured to alert the operator whenever any of these keywords appeared in window titles or browser activity on the compromised host.\n\nFigure 9: SimpleHelp agent logs showing keyword-based monitoring triggers for cryptocurrency wallets, exchanges, blockchain explorers, and remote access tools via GlobalEvents\n\nThe threat actor leveraged the Net Monitor for Employees Professional built-in shell execution capability to perform network reconnaissance on the compromised domain controller. The agent spawned winpty-agent.exe, a Windows pseudo-terminal utility mentioned earlier. Through this capability, the attacker executed ping commands to probe internal network segments, as well as ipconfig /all to enumerate the host's network configuration. winpty-agent.exe is not unique to Net Monitor for Employees Professional and is commonly found across other RMM tools, including SimpleHelp and Level.\n\nShortly after, the threat actor reconfigured the agent using the software's native configuration utility nmep_agtconfig.exe, adding a third command-and-control endpoint at 192.144.34[.]35:443 alongside the original two.\n\nThese cases highlight a growing trend of threat actors leveraging legitimate, commercially available software to blend into enterprise environments. Net Monitor for Employees Professional, while marketed as a workforce monitoring tool, provides capabilities that rival traditional remote access trojans: reverse connections over common ports, process and service name masquerading, built-in shell execution, and the ability to silently deploy via standard Windows installation mechanisms. When paired with SimpleHelp as a secondary access channel, complete with keyword-based monitoring triggers targeting cryptocurrency activity, the result is a resilient, dual-tool foothold that is difficult to distinguish from legitimate administrative software.\n\nThe shared infrastructure between the two toolsets, with dronemaker[.]org serving as both a Net Monitor C2 and a SimpleHelp gateway, along with the reuse of the same vhost.exe filename and overlapping IP addresses across both cases, strongly suggests a single operator or group behind this activity. The threat actor's objectives appear to be twofold: cryptocurrency theft, evidenced by the SimpleHelp keyword monitoring targeting wallets, exchanges, and blockchain explorers, and ransomware deployment, as seen in Case #1 with the attempted delivery of Crazy ransomware.\n\nAdversaries are continually probing at exposed network perimeters such as VPN login interfaces, RDP, etc., to gain a foothold into the network. While the tools used may be novel, the root cause of these intrusions is not. The successful compromises observed in these cases, gaining access via a compromised vendor SSL VPN account and a likely initial compromise that allowed the malicious installation of monitoring software, underscore the critical need for robust perimeter defenses and strong identity hygiene.\n\nTo significantly reduce the risk of similar intrusions, organizations should prioritize the following steps:\n\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA): Enforce MFA on all remote access services (VPNs, RDP, VDI), administrative accounts, and external-facing applications. This is the single most effective defense against compromised credentials.\n\nPrinciple of least privilege: Strictly limit remote access to only those users and systems that absolutely require it.\n\nNetwork segmentation: Logically separate networks to prevent lateral movement, ensuring that a compromise of one system does not lead to the compromise of the entire environment.\n\nPatching and monitoring: Ensure all external-facing applications and devices (especially VPN and RDP gateways) are patched immediately and monitored for anomalous login attempts.\n\nAudit and scrutinize third-party software: Regularly audit all third-party RMM tools, as well as legitimate employee monitoring software. If a tool has remote command execution capabilities (like Net Monitor for Employees), treat it with the same level of scrutiny as a high-privilege system administrator tool.\n\nRestrict software installation: Limit user permissions to install software and use application control to restrict the execution of unauthorized or non-standard executables (like vhost.exe or unauthorized RMM agents).\n\nProcess monitoring: Monitor for unusual process execution chains, such as system binaries spawning unexpected executables, or RMM tools being used to deploy other RMM tools. The execution of msiexec with remote sources, especially with silent installation parameters, should be considered high-risk.\n\nDefense tampering: Configure alerts for any attempts to modify or disable security software, such as Windows Defender or EDR agents.\n\nDisable or rename default accounts: Ensure default accounts like Guest and Administrator are disabled or renamed where possible to reduce the surface area for common brute-force attacks.\n\nStrong password policies: Enforce strong, unique passwords for all accounts, especially administrative ones.\n\nRegular audits: Periodically audit user accounts, looking for newly created, enabled, or manipulated accounts, which is a common post-compromise activity.\n\nNetwork Monitor for Employees Command & Control (C2)\n\nNetwork Monitor for Employees C2\n\nNetwork Monitor for Employees C2\n\n0d332b4f5dc9c98097ccbda31847b85c1780c1a02764db3adcbaf67158fbffd0\n\nSHA-256: nmep_ctrlagentsvc.exe (Persistence)\n\nb21f3a77031bccc6f7feb03916a6734e6823328786f993457503c5960b67922b\n\nSHA-256: nmep_ctrlagentsvc.exe (Persistence)\n\n0b7801af15b6d13b242e8ec53e365b42e2b37edc0fd3e182c94b7d64814d0993\n\naadf879d5a37de295e6a331aaa38fd138c50317761d6bb97f91d2f354790434e\n\nHostname: Resolved hostname for SimpleHelp C2\n\nHostname: Resolved hostname for Network Monitor for Employees C2",

    "title": "20 Years of Varnish: A Cloud-Native Distribution (In-Core TLS, K8s Gateway API)",
    "description": "Varnish Cache now includes Varnish Enterprise features and provides a stable Long-Term Support roadmap, moving toward a native Cloud Native platform.",
    "fullText": "Co-authored by Rubén Romero and Per Buer\n\nMarking 20 years of Varnish this month, Varnish Software has established varnish.org as the central hub for our open-source development. We are reaffirming two decades of commitment by porting key Varnish Enterprise features to the open-source core and updating the Long-Term Support roadmap. This moves Varnish toward a platform, optimized for containerized and Kubernetes environments.\n\nWe are officially supporting Rust bindings, Helm charts, Docker images, and selected modules. Key upgrades to Varnish Cache include:\n\nIn-Core TLS support: Client-side and backend TLS are coming directly to the core. This has been the most requested feature for years, and the workarounds, hitch, stunnel, envoy, nginx as a TLS terminator, add operational complexity that shouldn't be necessary in 2026. In particular, backend TLS has been quite hard to work around.\n\nDynamic backends: Static backend configuration doesn't fit well with service discovery and orchestrated environments where backends come and go. Dynamic backend support solves this, allowing backends to be added and removed at runtime without VCL reloads.\n\nKubernetes Gateway API: An official Gateway API implementation is in development. The goal is for Varnish to work as a native component in Kubernetes clusters, configured through standard Gateway API resources rather than custom integrations.\n\nOpen telemetry: Full Open Telemetry support via varnish-otel, including varnishlog-json, metrics, logs and traces.\n\nVarnish Cache will operate as a dedicated downstream distribution of the Vinyl project. This allows to focus on containerized environments while maintaining the stability built over the last two decades.\n\nVarnish Software remains a core participant in the Vinyl Cache Project, collaborating on release and security issues just as we have since 2006. While the codebases might eventually drift, the priority remains delivering a distribution tailored for modern cloud infrastructure.\n\nWe are retiring Varnish Cache 6.0 and moving to a new Long-Term Support release to keep the stable foundation modern.\n\nNext  LTS: This will be  based on version 8.0 or the version scheduled for March 2026, which will be the first based on the Vinyl upstream.\n\n6.0 End-of-Life: Supported until March 2027 to provide a full one-year migration window for existing users.\n\nWe will be in Amsterdam for KubeCon Europe in March to share more about this new chapter for Varnish Cache. If you are attending, we would love to connect. Stop by our booth to see the roadmap in action, or book a time here to set up a dedicated meeting to discuss your cloud-native requirements.\n\nIf you want to discuss this further, you can find us here:\n\nDiscord Channel - While newer and less populated than the IRC channel, the Varnish discord server is also a good place to ask questions about configuration, HTTP, vmods or anything that’s even remotely related to Varnish.",

    "description": "Anthropic and OpenAI now have their own well-funded political groups that will square off in the midterm elections over artificial intelligence safety and regulation.",
    "fullText": "Silicon Valley’s dueling artificial intelligence start-ups now have dueling super PACs.\n\nAnthropic, the safety-focused A.I. company formed by former OpenAI executives, said on Thursday that it was putting $20 million into a new super PAC operation that will be in opposition to super PACs backed by OpenAI’s leaders and investors.\n\nThe donation effectively kicks off a new conflict between the rivals, with this year’s midterm elections as the battleground. At the heart of the disagreement between the companies is whether to regulate the artificial intelligence industry with more safety guardrails around the powerful technology. Anthropic generally favors politicians who are more pro-regulation than OpenAI does.\n\nThe New York Times reported in November that the group Anthropic donated to, Public First Action, was in talks with the company to fund its effort to help ensure that OpenAI did not amass too much political power. The regulation-skeptical super PACs backed by OpenAI’s leaders and investors are called Leading the Future.\n\nIn a blog post on Thursday, Anthropic did not name OpenAI but warned that “vast resources have flowed to political organizations that oppose” A.I. safety efforts.\n\n“The A.I. policy decisions we make in the next few years will touch nearly every part of public life,” the company wrote. “We don’t want to sit on the sidelines while these policies are developed.”\n\nAnthropic’s funding will supercharge an effort to elect federal lawmakers who favor more extensive A.I. regulation, a position at odds with the Trump administration.\n\nPublic First is a dark-money nonprofit, which means it is not required to disclose its donors but can air television ads on behalf of candidates. On Thursday, it said it would begin a television ad campaign “thanking” Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican who is running for governor in her state, for her work on tech policy.\n\nPublic First also funds two allied super PACs. One, Defending Our Values PAC, said it would begin an ad campaign on behalf of Senator Pete Ricketts, Republican of Nebraska, who faces re-election in 2026 and has also been outspoken on A.I. safety.\n\nThe Public First effort was started as a rejoinder to the Leading the Future super PACs backed by OpenAI leaders and investors, which have publicly reported raising over $50 million so far. About half of that came from the OpenAI investor Andreessen Horowitz and about half from the family of Greg Brockman, president and co-founder of OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI, which was until recently a traditional nonprofit, has not been allowed to make direct political contributions. But the company has mounted an aggressive Washington policy push over the last several years, which now includes an expressly political component through its aligned super PACs.\n\nAnthropic, by contrast, is making a contribution in its own name. The San Francisco-based company had spent at least five months “actively working” on a super PAC strategy, said Jack Clark, a co-founder, in September, as part of a broader effort to find its way in Washington.\n\nAnthropic’s $20 million contribution carries some political risks. While OpenAI has been largely embraced by the Trump administration, Anthropic and its chief executive, Dario Amodei, have been perceived as a thorn in the White House’s side. Administration officials such as David Sacks, the White House’s A.I. chief, have regularly and publicly criticized Anthropic. Mr. Sacks said in October that the company was promoting a “state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the start-up ecosystem.”",

    "description": ": Like a puppy, a fun new toy soon turns into an unrelenting taskmaster",
    "fullText": "A Harvard Business Review study is answering the question ‘what will employees do if AI saves them time at work?’ The answer: more work.\n\nResearchers Aruna Ranganathan and Xingqi Maggie Ye with University of California Berkeley’s Haas School of Business studied a set of 40 workers at a 200-employee tech company from April to December last year to see whether generative AI had changed work habits in engineering, product, design, research, and operations.\n\n\"We found that employees worked at a faster pace, took on a broader scope of tasks, and extended work into more hours of the day, often without being asked to do so,\" the researchers wrote. \"Importantly, the company did not mandate AI use (though it did offer enterprise subscriptions to commercially available AI tools). On their own initiative, workers did more because AI made 'doing more' feel possible, accessible, and in many cases intrinsically rewarding.\"\n\nUnfortunately the intensity of the work, the longer hours, and task expansion, led employees to feel stretched too thin, as the added work ate into their personal time.\n\n\"That workload creep can in turn lead to cognitive fatigue, burnout, and weakened decision-making,” the researchers satiated. “The productivity surge enjoyed at the beginning can give way to lower quality work, turnover, and other problems.\"\n\nDuring interviews with the employees, researchers found that using generative AI made it easier for employees to begin tasks that may have otherwise been daunting when starting from a blank page. Additionally, they were more willing to take on new responsibilities that had belonged to other roles thanks to a cognitive boost from AI.\n\nBut there were also engineering employees who found themselves checking the work of novice coders for errors, coaching vibe coders, and finishing projects that others had started.\n\nBecause it was easy to start tasks, the workers in the study began to work during breaks, at night and early in the morning, with fewer natural pauses in their workday.\n\n\"What looks like higher productivity in the short run can mask silent workload creep and growing cognitive strain as employees juggle multiple AI-enabled workflows,\" researchers said. \"Because the extra effort is voluntary and often framed as enjoyable experimentation, it is easy for leaders to overlook how much additional load workers are carrying.\"\n\nThe fear is that this could impair judgement, increase the likelihood of errors, and mask unsustainable intensity as productivity gains.\n\n\"For workers, the cumulative effect is fatigue, burnout, and a growing sense that work is harder to step away from, especially as organizational expectations for speed and responsiveness rise,\" the paper stated.\n\nEmployees have some cause to fear losing their jobs with Forrester’s most recent AI job replacement research estimates that the technology could uproot 6 percent of jobs by 2030, or about 10.4 million, through robotic process automation, business process automation, physical robotics, and generative AI.\n\nHowever, whether that comes with added productivity is a separate argument. Forrester’s vice president and principal analyst J. P. Gownder recently told The Register he is unconvinced that AI will revolutionize productivity.\n\nThe Berkeley researchers suggested developing a set of standards to prevent burnout.\n\nThis includes \"intentional pauses\" to fight back against the blurred boundaries between roles, regulate the tempo of development, and make sure tasks that begin with one purpose don’t meander from the company’s goals.\n\n\"For example, a decision pause could require, before a major decision is finalized, one counterargument and one explicit link to organizational goals — widening the attention field just enough to protect against drift,” the researchers wrote. \"Incorporating such pauses into everyday workflow is one way organizations can support better decisions, healthier boundaries, and more sustainable forms of productivity in AI-augmented environments.\"\n\nThey also advise organizations to work on projects in coherent phases and to move forward deliberately rather than at the pace that AI might allow them to move. Make the team lead the AI; don’t let the AI lead the team.\n\n“By regulating the order and timing of work — rather than demanding continuous responsiveness — sequencing can help organizations preserve attention, reduce cognitive overload, and support more thoughtful decision-making in AI-forward workplaces,” they wrote.\n\nIntroducing more human interaction can also help prevent the depleting effects of AI-mediated work.\n\n\"As AI enables more solo, self-contained work, organizations can benefit from protecting time and space for listening and human connection. Short opportunities to connect with others—whether through brief check-ins, shared reflection moments, or structured dialogue—interrupt continuous solo engagement with AI tools and help restore perspective.\" ®",

    "title": "The booming business of public breakups",
    "description": "From fancy tasting menus to bars, restaurant workers have overheard their fair shares of public breakups. Here's what they think of yours.",
    "fullText": "From Lane Denbro's vantage point in the open kitchen of the trendy restaurant where he worked, it was hard to tell which was causing the couple more pain: the spicy food… or the unfolding break-up.\n\n\"They were ordering all of the spicy dishes on the menu, and so I just remember thinking that it must add so much intensity to what is already an intense conversation about whether or not we're going to break up,\" Denbro tells me.\n\nDenbro, then a line cook working the wok and the fry, saw the couple growing more frustrated with each other throughout their meal. By the time they left the table, Denbro says, they decided to call it quits.\n\nThe public, or quasi-public, break-up is its own storied genre. It's inspired some of the best scenes in great movies: The infamous \"Legally Blonde\" restaurant meltdown, or Mark Zuckerberg not realizing he's getting broken up with in \"The Social Network\" (Joe Cammarata, the co-owner of bar Tall Order, which took over the space in Somerville, MA, where that scene was filmed, says there's been at least one breakup in the bar since they opened in March). If you've decided it's time to part ways, a public end can sting; sobbing at a coffee shop or park isn't pleasant for anyone. Of course, ending things in public has its uses, especially if you're worried about a partner's reaction to pulling the plug.\n\nIf anything, public breakups might become more common. As homes get smaller, rents rise, and roommates abound (including ones you're related to: 18% of 25- to 34-year-olds live with their parents), you don't want to have to move out of a now-cursed space or have your parents asking what's wrong. I once heard that a New York edict is never to break up with someone at your apartment: Chances are it's small, and afterward every tiny crevice — or the dent in your cheap Ikea couch — will remind you of your ex.\n\n\"I think public breakups are as common as they've ever been, but they might've been amplified through social media, which creates the illusion that public breakups are a thing,\" Julie Nguyen, a certified dating coach at the Hily dating app, says. \"In Gen Z, it can be uncomfortable to break up, and a public setting can often be used as a way to emotionally manage the intensity by not giving the person an opportunity to crash out.\"\n\nFor the bartenders, back-of-house workers, and servers helping people navigate their \"it's not you, it's me\" speeches, that's spawned its own mini break-up economy.\n\n\"If you're going through a breakup, make sure to tip well, because the service staff in the back of house, we're going to try to support you however we can,\" Denbro says.\n\nGetting into a relationship is an investment. Back in 2024, I calculated the cost of getting a successful relationship off the ground and found that singles had to pony up around $650 to move forward with their matches. Climbing out of a relationship is similarly costly — especially if you cohabitate. The cost of the singles tax — how much more solo renters pay annually to live alone compared to couples — is above $7,000. Even if you don't live with that formerly special someone, you are likely to incur some costs from a breakup, especially if you've been divvying up various costs. That begets another economic question: Who pays in a public break-up?\n\nEmma, a bartender at Ethyl's — a New York City bar listed as one of the best spots in the city to break up — witnessed a couple come in on a packed Saturday night. The woman turned to her then-boyfriend and asked him why she had caught him kissing her male best friend. Then, she threw his phone to the ground. The now-ex-boyfriend quietly paid for their margaritas. Bela, another bartender at Ethyl's, says that one-half of a Gen X couple came in already drunk, and the couple split up on the spot over her drinking. When the inebriated member of the defunct twosome went to pay, her debit card declined. The now-ex-boyfriend there ended up paying and tipping well.\n\nGabrielle Macafee, a 30-year-old chef and writer, has witnessed the higher-end version of a public split. She was working at a small tasting menu restaurant in Brooklyn when a \"morose\" couple came in. As their conversation grew more emotional, the staff took notice. Halfway through the $130 tasting menu, the man stood up and left.\n\n\"My teammates and I were like, wait, how do we handle this? He's gone. You can only hold the food for so long,\" Macafee says. Eventually, the woman left behind said she'd just pay for both meals. \"We offered to send her the rest, but obviously, she just wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.\"\n\nThere is also an art to choosing where to have the public breakup, if it must be done outside the comfort of your home. Macafee thinks somewhere that's a step above a dive bar in a neutral neighborhood — one that's mutually convenient, but not a place you frequent — is an ideal spot.\n\n\"I wouldn't recommend choosing a place that's in your neighborhood or a spot that you visit,\" Nguyen, the dating coach, says. \"You don't want either of you to feel dread going back, or tie bad memories to a spot they love. A neutral, quiet outdoor setting is the best play.\"\n\nWhile it's good advice, it can also make for breakup patterns. One Business Insider editor recalled getting dumped by three separate paramours at the same park in Chicago. There are also a few common signs that your bar or restaurant outing might not end with an intact relationship. Denbro, the former line cook, says that one tell-tale sign that things were not going well was when a couple kept changing their order, or when one half of the couple decided after the fact that they wanted something different. Duplicative orders — like each ordering their own appetizers and entrées at the family-style restaurant — were also a tip off.\n\nAt one breakup that Macafee witnessed, the duo had different wines, perhaps marking the end of the conviviality that would lead you to split a bottle with a lover. AB Soria, a general manager of a restaurant in Chicago who's worked in the industry since 1995, tells me that if you're planning on ending things, a seat at the bar is the way to go.\n\n\"If you're going to sit down at the table, I just feel like that's kind of cruel. Because then it's you're anticipating having a dinner and spending time there — and then to get broken up with, and then you're just stuck sitting there — is horrible,\" Soria says. \"At the bar, at least, I feel like there's more of an ability for the bartender to see what's going on, and then also make sure that whoever's left at the bar is OK.\"\n\nTiming is another complicating factor in the art of the public breakup. There's what's colloquially known as \"breakup season,\" the time around the end of the year when folks take stock of what they want and don't want. That can align with what dating coach Amy Nobile Messing says is generally a pivotal time in a relationship: The three-month mark is decision time. If you participated in a late-summer, early-fall tryst, your time might be up come years' end. Messing says she's coached many people to break up in a coffee shop — she feels like there's less pressure there.\n\n\"Here's the thing — unless it's a total shock — usually it's not a shock, usually it's like, 'Things haven't been great. I really think we should talk and meet at our coffee shop',\" Messing says. \"There's already an energy of separation, and so it just lends itself to paying separately.\"\n\nIronically, some of the impetus for a public breakup might be financial.\n\nChristine Hargrove, a clinical assistant professor at the University of Georgia and the assistant director of the university's Love and Money Center, says that daters are increasingly comingling their finances without a set structure in place — they may not have the formality of a shared bank account, but are informally splitting expenses like rent and food. That makes sense in our increasingly costly times. The downside, though, is that a breakup can feel even more heightened in those situations. Disentangling shared finances — even those informal ones — can feel like a threat, Hargrove says.\n\n\"People get really emotional when they feel financially threatened. Frankly, people can behave in unexpected ways when they're experiencing that level of threat,\" Hargrove says. That can lead to a public uncoupling, where folks hope to leverage social norms to head off more intense emotional reactions.\n\nThere is some good financial news: Messing says break-ups shouldn't be costly. If you have to take it outside, she advises against ordering food. But if you do crack open the menu, avoid anything fancy.\n\n\"You don't want to be eating a crab claw when you're breaking up. You don't want to have a mouthful of shrimp,\" Messing says. If you have to eat, maybe get a muffin or something you can nibble on — nothing too involved. Get a to-go cup, and try to keep the spending to around $5 to $10.\n\n\"I really think it should be minimal spending. I think it should be coffee. I think it should be maybe one drink,\" Messing says. \"It should be commensurate with what's happening, and what's happening is the end of something.\"\n\nThat's a spot of good wallet news for those ending their relationships. And, emotionally, there is a light on the other side of the public break-up tunnel. Macafee, the chef and writer, loves to frequent her favorite neighborhood diner. Over the summer, she found herself there, getting broken up with.\n\n\"This little doowoop song comes on, and I've never heard it before, but it was like, 'Breaking up is hard to do.' It was just that line over and over and over again,\" she says. \"And then I was trying not to laugh at the irony that that was playing in my little diner that I love so much as this woman is eviscerating my heart.\"\n\nIn the case of Macafee's breakup, the now-ex paid. Still, she was worried that her favorite spot would be tainted forever. It's a conundrum that every public dumper or dumpee has likely encountered, seeing their ghostly selves sitting in the windows of that random bar or restaurant. When I found out that the ice cream store I was once dumped at had closed, it felt bittersweet — a version of me that had once been there (and split the bill!) would no longer be able to haunt it. I wouldn't want to go through the breakup again, but it was nice to have a physical marker of a version of myself — heartbroken and lost — that I would hopefully never be again.\n\nFor her part, Macafee continued going to the diner, powering through the lingering sadness that would arise every time she came in to write or gab with a friend. Ironically, she went in the other day and heard that same break-up song again.\n\n\"After the breakup, I still went, but definitely, every time I would go, it'd give me this pang of sadness that, over time, just heals. Now I don't have that anymore,\" Macafee says. \"As I'm dating somebody else now and I'm falling in love, now it's just this pillar that I'm kind of tethered to, and I can look at and recognize my own growth and my own love stories as they unfold and break down.\"\n\nJuliana Kaplan is a senior reporter on the economy team, where she covers the labor force, kitchen table economics, and the people behind the numbers.",

    "fullText": "McDonald's is gearing up to feed a growing consumer group on weight-loss drugs.\n\nIn a Wednesday earnings call, McDonald's executives talked about how the chain was testing menu items for more customers on GLP-1s.\n\nCEO Chris Kempczinski said he expects GLP-1 adoption to continue to grow, adding, \"as adoption grows, we know that consumers' behavior changes.\"\n\nHe said these customers are interested in protein-rich products, and that McDonald's already has a menu of high-protein dishes. Vice President Jill McDonald chimed in with examples of McDonald's Snack Wraps, Sausage Biscuit sandwich, and chicken McCrispy Strips.\n\n\"But we're also seeing changes around maybe less snacking, changes in some of the beverages that they drink, less sugary drinks,\" Kempczinski said. \"And so all of those things are factoring into some of what we're out there experimenting with and testing with.\"\n\nJill McDonald added that the team has ideas in the works for how to better serve customers on GLP-1 drugs in the long term, though she did not share any additional details.\n\nGLP-1 adoption in the US is on the rise. An EY consumer products expert told Business Insider last year that 10% of the entire US population was on some form of GLP-1 drugs. These drugs, like Ozempic and Wegovy, are known to suppress appetite, leading to users opting for small portion sizes.\n\nAnd it's reshaping the US food and beverage sector.\n\nIt's not just McDonald's that's thinking of this growing customer base. Brands that sell packaged foods, like General Mills and Conagra Brands, have smaller-portion products targeted at people with shrinking appetites. Conagra Brands, which owns brands like Slim Jim and Marie Callender's, labels some of its Healthy Choice frozen meals as \"GLP-1 Friendly.\"\n\nShake Shack in December introduced its \"Good Fit Menu,\" with high-protein, gluten-free, vegetarian, and \"GLP-1-friendly\" choices. The menu included three burgers wrapped in lettuce instead of buns.\n\nMcDonald's reported a 5.7% increase in global comparable sales in its latest quarter, with sales of about $7 billion. Its stock price remained relatively flat after earnings were announced.",

    "description": "Polymarket welcomes insider trading. Kalshi says it's banned — but it's unclear how that works in practice.",
    "fullText": "Prediction markets are booming. So are concerns that they're rife with insider trading.\n\nThe two biggest platforms have starkly different positions on the practice. Polymarket sees insider trading as a feature, not a bug.\n\n\"What's cool about Polymarket is that it creates this financial incentive for people to go and divulge the information to the market and the market to change,\" founder Shayne Coplan told 60 Minutes in November.\n\nKalshi has struck a different note. Last week, the company announced a series of measures aimed at cracking down on users trying to cash in on nonpublic information: an expert advisory committee; a new partnership with the trade-surveillance company Solidus Labs; and a new head of enforcement, the lawyer Robert DeNault.\n\n\"We have a lot of data on traders, users, that other prediction markets don't have,\" DeNault, who joined Kalshi in October, told Business Insider. The company said it has made referrals to authorities, and DeNault said it also has its own internal rulebook and disciplinary processes, which would roll out \"in the near future.\"\n\n\"There's lots of activity that gets flagged,\" he said. \"It could be fraud, it could be theft, it could be a person hacking into their neighbor's computer.\"\n\nDefining what counts as insider trading on prediction markets can be difficult — even for Kalshi's own leadership.\n\nOn CNBC's Squawk Box on Tuesday, Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour faced questions about whether a Bad Bunny backup dancer would be committing insider trading if they bet on what his opening song would be.\n\nMansour did not say yes, but insisted that the line between a permissible trade and an impermissible one was clear. \"If that's the position that people are taking, which is essentially, 'This is nonmaterial, nonpublic information, it's OK to actually talk about which song is going to be played,' or 'it's OK to divulge a series of information beforehand,' then it's OK and it's totally fair game,\" Mansour said.\n\nSo far, little alleged misuse of Kalshi has become public. A student worker at the University of Tennessee was fired after a Kalshi surveillance tool flagged that the student had taken a position on a University of Tennessee football game in October, according to a report in the Knoxville News Sentinel, which cited public records. The student was accused of violating a National Collegiate Athletic Association rule, not misusing confidential information.\n\nJohn Auerbach, a managing director at the investigations firm Nardello & Co., said prediction market operators shouldn't only be concerned about law enforcement peering over their shoulder. He said \"it's not good business\" to have a reputation as a place where insiders profit at the expense of other users.\n\nAuerbach said US-based prediction markets are coming to terms with a simple reality: \"You need to upgrade your controls.\"\n\nJay Clayton, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said at the Securities Enforcement Forum on Thursday that he expects there to be prosecutions related to prediction markets, though he didn't say when.\n\nHe compared it to point-shaving in basketball, which formed the basis for criminal charges that the Justice Department unveiled last month. \"That's a crime,\" he said. \"Because it's a prediction market doesn't insulate you from fraud.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that Clayton's office closed an investigation last July into whether Polymarket had knowingly dealt with US traders, despite having committed in a 2022 deal with the CFTC to not serving them.\n\nDeNault said prosecutors or the CFTC — which can bring a civil lawsuit, but can't criminally charge people — could take years to act. While the amount traded on US prediction markets has grown exponentially over the past year, the statutes of limitations on potential fraud charges are between five and ten years.\n\nProsecutors have traditionally tended \"to like to use a lot of that time to build perfect cases,\" said DeNault \"Some of the most high-profile recent activity in terms of sports trading integrity investigations, some of it dates back 5 years, 6 years, a long time.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the markets keep growing. Kalshi said it recorded $1 billion in Super Bowl trading volume on Sunday — up 2,700% from last year.\n\nMore than $100 million was bet on what song Bad Bunny would open with.",

    "fullText": "AI agents should be treated like employees who need vetting before they're trusted with real work, says Cisco's president.\n\nJeetu Patel said in an interview with Euonews Next published on Wednesday that AI agents working on our behalf \"need to get the background checks done,\" just like human employees.\n\nAs companies race to deploy autonomous AI systems that can write code, handle workflows, and make decisions, security needs to evolve just as quickly, he said.\n\n\"You have to protect the agent from the world of attacks, and you have to protect the world from the agent that goes rogue,\" he added.\n\nPatel's comments come as Cisco accelerates its own AI adoption. He predicts that by the end of 2026, the company will have \"at least half a dozen products\" written entirely with AI, with no human-written lines of code, he said.\n\n\"We won't have developers at Cisco that don't use AI as a core habit within the way that they get the job done,\" he said.\n\n\"Don't worry about AI taking your job, but worry about someone using AI better than you definitely taking your job,\" he added.\n\nTech leaders are going all in on AI agents.\n\nStackBlitz CEO Eric Simons told Business Insider he wants more AI agents than human employees at his startup this year — a milestone that reflects a broader transformation sweeping the software industry.\n\nAI can already write code, manage tasks, and coordinate across platforms. OpenClaw, a personal AI assistant that works across messaging apps, is one example of how agents can operate on a human's behalf with minimal involvement.\n\n\"This is a crystal ball into the wildness of the inevitable future,\" Simons told Business Insider in a report published Wednesday.\n\n\"Your AI agents will talk to other people's agents on your behalf — negotiating pricing for a product you want to buy, checking restaurant availability, even arguing your political viewpoints,\" he added.\n\nSoftware stocks slid in recent weeks as investors grappled with the idea that AI may replace software.\n\nStill, there are warning signs. Agentic systems can become fragile at scale. If hallucinations multiply as agents interact, small errors can cascade, said Nicolas Darveau-Garneau, a former Google executive and author of \"Be a Sequoia, Not a Bonsai.\"\n\n\"The only way we get massive productivity gains is the day we can trust that the AI isn't hallucinating a lot,\" Darveau-Garneau said.",

    "description": "Matt Shumer said he wrote his viral essay for people like his dad who are skeptical of AI or just trying to avoid it entirely.",
    "fullText": "The author of the viral essay warning about impending AI disruption says he couldn't wait any longer to get the word out.\n\n\"Let's say there is just a 20% chance of it happening, which is maybe realistic, maybe underselling it,\" Matt Shumer, GP of Shumer Capital, said during an interview with Business Insider. \"Even if there is a 20% chance of this happening, people deserve to know and have time to prepare.\"\n\nThe people in tech who previously warned about AI's impact were mostly speaking to others in the industry, he said. Shumer said he wanted something that spoke to his dad, a lawyer who is just a few years from retirement and is hopeful he can run out the clock on the potential massive change on the horizon.\n\nHe's certainly found an audience.\n\nHis essay, titled \"Something Big is Coming,\" has been viewed over 60 million times on X alone, as of Wednesday evening. In the nearly 5,000-word post, Shumer wrote that AI's disruption to people's lives could be \"much bigger\" than COVID — a comparison that has drawn some pushback online. He also wrote that what he's seeing in tech is likely what awaits other industries.\n\n\"I don't know that this is coming for sure, but I think a lot of us in tech really see this progress, and it's frankly dizzying, and there's a good chance of this,\" he said. \"And the more people know, the better.\"\n\nShumer is not alone in his fears about the future.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who is known for writing eyebrow-raising essays of his own, has said that up to half of all entry-level, white-collar jobs may be wiped out in the next one to five years. xAI CEO Elon Musk has called AI a \"supersonic tsunami\" that will quickly eliminate jobs that don't involve physical labor.\n\nShumer said even he is unsettled about the prospects of AI. After all, he's 26 and still near the beginning years of his career. In 2020, he cofounded OthersideAI, which later spawned HyperWrite, an AI-assisted writing tool.\n\n\"I don't know how many more years of my career there will be if this all actually comes to pass,\" he told Business Insider. \"So, it's frankly a little confusing and terrifying for someone like me.\"\n\nPart of the issue is that AI is unlikely to affect all industries in the same way or at the same time, making career advice highly dependent on a person's specific situation.\n\n\"If you're a nurse, you're probably going to be fine for quite some time,\" he told Business Insider, adding that junior associates at law school face significantly more risk because many of the introductory-type tasks they do are already being targeted by AI companies.\n\nIn his essay, Shumer wrote that his realization of what's in store came after his experience with OpenAI's GPT-5.3-Codex, which was released last week. In its release notes, OpenAI said GPT-5.3-Codex was its \"first model that was instrumental in creating itself.\" Shumer wrote that AI is now capable of doing his technical work.\n\nAs for the other tasks, Shumer has been quite open about how AI helped him write his viral essay about AI. He said he spent hours working with Claude to craft his message.\n\n\"It did help a lot,\" he told TBPN on Wednesday, \"and I think that's kind of the point.\"\n\nIt's why Shumer's message to everyone who turned away from AI, perhaps after a clunky experience with an early version of ChatGPT years ago, is that they should seize the opportunity to see the breadth of what the technology can do now.\n\n\"If you look back 10 years from now and this did come to pass, you'll be very glad you did,\" he told Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "After wearing the cap and gown, snapping photos with family, and saying goodbye to college friends, new graduates will pivot to their first postgrad job.\n\nOthers will hope their degrees and newly acquired skills will soon lead to a job offer like those of their peers.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York analyzed 73 college majors, including miscellaneous groupings, using Census Bureau data from 2024 to examine unemployment for recent grads, defined as 22- to 27-year-olds with a bachelor's degree or higher.\n\nSeveral art-related majors had high unemployment rates, but anthropology ranked highest at nearly 8%. Unemployment for early childhood education majors was also among the highest, but a few educational fields had the lowest unemployment rates.\n\nThe chart below shows the college majors with rates above 6.0%.\n\nDaniel Zhao, the chief economist at Glassdoor, told Business Insider that the majors with the highest rates are interesting because they don't fit into a single group.\n\n\"You have some majors that have very restrictive job markets, like fine arts or performing arts, but then you also have other majors that have been very attractive and that offer high-paying jobs, like computer engineering or computer science,\" Zhao said.\n\nZhao pointed to underemployment rates, or the share of grads getting a job that doesn't usually need a degree. Computer engineering and computer science had underemployment rates below 20%, while anthropology, fine arts, and performing arts had rates above 50%.\n\n\"Say a computer science grad is having a hard time finding a job in tech in the current market, but they know that if they can land one, it'll be worth their while because the pay in tech is so much higher than other industries,\" Zhao said. \"So they're willing to sit it out and wait until a good role comes along.\"\n\nZhao said grads with anthropology or fine arts degrees \"don't necessarily have the financial cushion to not look for a job right now\" because these roles typically don't pay as much as a tech role.\n\nThe US just had the lowest year of job growth since 2003 outside recessions. While layoffs haven't ticked up much and unemployment remains low, hiring has tumbled from a few years ago, making it an especially rough market for people newly entering the workforce. The unemployment rate for recent college graduates was 5.6% in December, up from 4.8% at the start of 2025.\n\n\"This low-hire, low-fire trend has likely contributed to the rise in the unemployment rates of young workers,\" a research note from Goldman Sachs said, and added that it \"raises the risk that these workers might be increasingly locked out of the labor market.\"\n\nZhao suggested that job seekers in the slower job market work on networking, including leveraging career services at their alma mater and talking to alums. He also suggested people broaden their job search because there could be roles that need their skills that job seekers haven't considered applying for.\n\nHany Farid, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, previously told Business Insider that good jobs for computer science graduates aren't at \"the usual suspects.\"\n\n\"I have always contended that the most exciting applications of computer science are not at Facebook, Google, and Amazon, but at the intersection of computing and other fields,\" Farid said.\n\nThat can include computational drug discovery, computational finance, digital humanities, and other roles.",

    "fullText": "Sportswear giant Nike is seeking a golden moment at the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nThe Nike ACG logo, short for All Conditions Gear, is on the chests of Team USA athletes at the Winter Games. Nike is using the stage to relaunch its 37-year-old outdoor performance gear brand.\n\nThe effort is gaining traction online as Team USA racks up medals.\n\nNike unveiled the Team USA collection on January 28, and it's been having a moment on social media as athletes don the gear at the games. Between January 30 and the February 6 opening ceremony in Milan, conversations on X mentioning ACG and the Olympics increased by 273%, data analytics firm PeakMetrics told Business Insider.\n\nGoogle searches for \"Nike ACG\" also spiked during the first week of February, then hit a new peak this week with the Olympic Games underway, according to Google Trends.\n\nACG debuted in 1989 as a brand designed for trail running and hiking. Unlike brands like Air Jordan, it remained a niche collection that generated little revenue for Nike. As streetwear styles like gorpcore have taken off in the 2020s, the timing of a revival lines up with mainstream fashion. On the performance side, Nike defines itself as a brand for all outdoor athletes.\n\nThe Olympics sponsorship goes beyond Team USA, with Nike tapping Italian tennis player Jannik Sinner to star in an ACG campaign. The Instagram post featuring Skinner in a custom look garnered nearly 200,000 likes, and ACG's following on the app has grown to more than 48,000 since launching on February 2.\n\nThe collection includes outerwear, base layers, and shoes designed for trail racing and hiking — all of which can be spotted on Team USA throughout the Olympics.\n\nNike's push to outfit Olympic athletes should look familiar to anyone paying attention to CEO Elliott Hill's vision for the company. The Nike boss has put sports performance gear at the center of the brand's mission — a pivot from the lifestyle path Nike was on before Hill took the helm in October 2024.\n\nIn a testament to that strategy, women athletes were the stars of Nike's big return to the Super Bowl last year with its first ad in the game in 27 years. The company has also restructured internally and reformatted its stores to focus on sports.\n\nThe plan is coming into shape in the outdoor space. Nike has plans to open the first stand-alone ACG store in Beijing in February.\n\n\"ACG has the foundation to shape the future of outdoor performance while pushing into spaces that feel fresh and unexpected,\" Scott LeClair, vice president and general manager of ACG, said in a January press release.\"It is going to be a fun ride.\"",

    "description": "Andrew McCollum, the CEO of Philo, shares his career journey and routine, from helping start Facebook in 2004 to running a streaming platform now.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Andrew McCollum, the 42-year-old CEO of Philo, based in San Francisco. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy first job was at Subway, but my first meaningful career job was helping to start Facebook during my time at Harvard.\n\nI spent a lot of time with Mark Zuckerberg, Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes, and the other founders of the company. We worked together on various things and discussed ideas for projects we thought were cool. One thing we discussed was the concept of creating a universal Facebook.\n\nDuring one winter break, Mark wrote the first version of Facebook and asked if I wanted to handle the graphics and design.\n\nI was there for the first year and a half of the company. I returned in the summer between my last few years of college. I didn't go back to Facebook after I graduated. Instead, I traveled for a year through 40 countries.\n\nAfter my trip, I sold some of my Facebook stock and became an entrepreneur-in-residence at a couple of VC firms. I was introduced to what was then called Tivli, and is now Philo, where I became an angel investor and advisor.\n\nI met the other cofounders of Philo, a streaming and live television service, when they had just built the prototype in late 2010. I immediately fell in love with what they were doing and became an advisor when they began raising money.\n\nIt all happened naturally. I became the CEO of Philo in September 2014. Here's what a typical day in my life looks like now.\n\nMy wife doesn't sleep as well or as consistently as I do, so she's often up before I am. Our kids usually wake up between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m.\n\nIn the morning, I'll check Slack to see if anything big has happened within the company, and then I'll check the headlines to see if anything big has happened in the world.\n\nI don't do a ton of work in the morning, but I'll check in to see if there's anything that demands an immediate response. I don't have a policy against checking my devices at any particular time of day, but I don't constantly respond to emails or Slack messages.\n\nI've mastered a lot of the breakfast staples at this point — I make pancakes, crepes, French toast, eggs, and bacon for my kids. I don't eat breakfast myself.\n\nI used to not drink coffee at all, but now I drink one cup of espresso-based coffee every day. However, I don't do that until I arrive at the office because we have nice espresso machines there.\n\nI try to get everyone out the door. My wife and I split up the school drop-off.\n\nI work from home very rarely, as I prefer to be in the office every day. If I have several tasks spread throughout the day that are easier to complete from home, I'll occasionally work from home.\n\nI take Waymo to the office 90% of the time. I appreciate autonomous cars, which have significantly improved the commute to and from the office.\n\nThe things I thought I was going to hate about Waymo turned out to be the best things about it — a driver that's going to drive the speed limit, make a complete stop at every stop sign, and drive super conservatively.\n\nThe robotic drive allows me to focus on work. I use that time to start my day before I arrive at the office — sometimes I'm on a Zoom call, and sometimes I'm just on Slack. Sometimes I'm writing code.\n\nMeetings make up my entire schedule. We have a main meeting to plan our work in six- or seven-week cycles. One of those weeks is designated as a no-meeting week, meaning all regularly scheduled weekly meetings are paused.\n\nThose weeks, I typically have a lot more free time. I tend to use it to think through company strategy or write code on projects — I'm an engineer by training, and I still enjoy it when I get the chance to do technical work.\n\nI make myself very available and tell people every chance I get that they're welcome to message me or set up a time with me at their convenience. I actually wish people did it more.\n\nI rarely have a real lunch. I only do it if I have a lunch meeting scheduled with someone outside the office. If I do have lunch, I change it up a lot. My favorite lunch restaurants around the office are Xica, North Beach Cantina, Tony's Pizza Napoletana, and Pier 23.\n\nI may grab a snack between meetings during the day, but I don't have my first full, real meal until dinner time.\n\nMy afternoon is stacked with more meetings. I want to empower people so they feel they can take ownership.\n\nAs a CEO, it's my job to look at things differently from everyone else in the company. I view my role as synthesizing everything that's happening with the business across all the different areas we work in.\n\nI do some nonprofit work, and I'm on the board of the San Francisco General Hospital Foundation. When I'm out, I try to get to the gym.\n\nI always try to be home for dinner with my family. The gym I go to is very close to our office — a couple of blocks' walk. I need to leave the office around 4 p.m. if I'm going to make it there and still have enough time to get home in time for dinner with our kids.\n\nOn days I don't go to the gym, I'll leave around 5:30 pm.\n\nWaymo is sometimes very expensive and slow to get home in the evening. I often take an Uber or Lyft home.\n\nMy wife is also very busy, so we try to cook when we can, but sometimes we either order in or eat out.\n\nWe use a service like HelloFresh that prepares a home-cooked meal and delivers it to you; the portions are generous. We can have leftovers that need reheating.\n\nAfter dinner, cleaning the whole house, and getting everything organized, there's time for reading or watching a show in bed.\n\nMy wife reads a lot. I read, but not as much as she does. I enjoy doing crossword puzzles, and sometimes we'll work on them together, then we'll watch shows.\n\nWe enjoy shows like Taskmaster, a British comedy panel show featuring five comedians who are tasked with performing absurd, arbitrary tasks. I also watch various shows on Philo, and one of my favorites is the survival genre. Sometimes I'll watch The Daily Show.\n\nI sleep seven to eight hours a night.\n\nIf my wife goes to bed before me, I'm more likely to stay up a little later, perhaps even a bit past 11 p.m.\n\nI'm typically available on Slack. Often, I'm working on some project, but I don't work for many hours on weekends.\n\nTypically, I spend time with my family, and we go on some adventure or travel. In the evenings, I'll be checking Slack and email.\n\nVery rarely will a day go by without me doing something with Philo, but I try not to let work get in the way of spending time with my family.",

    "title": "Millennials shouldn't feel bad about staying on their parents' phone plans",
    "description": "Did a millennial write this? (Yes.) But I firmly believe: Coming off your parents' family cellphone plan doesn't make you an adult.",
    "fullText": "Before you yell at me, let me first say that I am not, and have never been, on my parents' cellphone plan. (I didn't get a cellphone until I was already an adult.) But I've long been jealous of my friends who are still on their parents' plans — it just makes good sense!\n\nYahoo News recently asked whether staying on your parents' phone plan as a 40-year-old makes you \"a harmless mooch or a generational failure?\"\n\nThe reporter, Fortesa Latifi, admits that she and her husband were still on their parents' plans until recently, and that many others are like her, some even with children of their own, and quite a few feel embarrassed about it.\n\nThere are significant savings to be had by joining a family plan. For example, right now, at T-Mobile, its unlimited talk, text, and data plan costs $85 for an individual plan. For a family of four, the same plan is around $42 per person.\n\nWhy are family plans so much cheaper per line? It's not that there are a lot more costs to operate cell service if a phone number isn't connected to a family plan. It's all about how advantageous it is for the carrier to sell family plans.\n\nFor one thing, if you're part of a family plan, you're less likely to shop around and switch carriers. It's also easier on the carrier's customer service: They only have to mail bills, process credit cards each month, and all that jazz for one person instead of several. (Verizon and T-Mobile didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on their pricing.)\n\nLast year, AT&T added a new feature that makes it easier to automatically split the bill for people who share a friends-and-family account. The person whose name is on the bill is still ultimately responsible for the full amount, so enter into this kind of arrangement only with people you really trust.\n\nAT&T pointed me to a news story published last year that quoted an exec saying 85% of their customers were on a multi-line plan. Think about that — that means if you actually are one of the suckers who is paying for a single line, you're in the vast minority.\n\nThere's no honor in paying more to have the bill in your own name — you're just paying more for the same services. Does your dignity and independence win out here, or does T-Mobile? Hmm?\n\nAT&T released its own study (so take it with a grain of salt) that said that 76% of Americans think that coming off a parent's cellphone plan is one of the \"ultimate signs\" of becoming an adult.\n\nSure, at first glance, this seems like a rite of passage into financial independence from your parents.\n\nIs it a smart financial choice?\n\nConsider that the T-Mobile plan — even if you paid back your mom each month for your portion of the phone bill, you'd be saving about $42.50 a month compared to the same service on an individual plan. That's $5,100 over a decade if you did it from age 22 to 32.\n\nIn fact, I'd say that part of becoming an adult is being smart about spending habits and money. And sticking to a family plan is the obviously wise choice.\n\nIf you choose to remove yourself from a family plan, you're just giving the cellphone carriers twice as much — and I see little glory or pride in that.\n\nLook, of course, this all depends on your relationship with your family. You may not want to have this financial tie to them, and you may be in a better financial situation than your parents. But bundling phone lines with other people, whether they're your family or just some friends, makes a lot of financial sense.\n\nMillennials, it's time to take pride in one smart financial decision that our generation is making. Embrace it! Be proud to be on a family plan!",

    "description": "In a more wellness-minded America, the new version of happy hour is more about boosting endorphins through sweat, not beer.",
    "fullText": "At companywide conferences, Bethany Mascena's firm used to have what was called \"lobby social club\": Colleagues would convene at the end of the day to drink and hang out.\n\nMascena, a Gen Xer from Rhode Island, works remotely as a franchise launch director for a company that helps franchisees get their businesses off the ground. While her firm is fully dispersed, they're also very social. Over the past year, however, the hangout culture has shifted from late-night drinks to early-morning workouts like Pilates and yoga. In the mornings, colleagues often meet up at 6 o'clock to run or walk a three-mile loop.\n\nThose loops draw workers across \"all different positions in the company — from directors to VPs to administrative support out there,\" Mascena said. It's an opportunity for \"walking and talking and connecting in a way that's just different than happy hour.\"\n\nIt's one sign of how coworker bonding is changing as folks are drinking less, in-person schedules are more variable with the rise of hybrid work, and work friendships are flailing.\n\nThe downfall of after-work drinks doesn't mean socializing is dead. Instead, some workers are getting creative: Think rage rooms, pickleball, saunas, and intense workouts. In a more wellness-minded America — and one where folks might want to optimize their post-work time — there's a focus on ways to boost endorphins other than the best beer deal. This shift might also mean forging deeper relationships along the way.\n\nKayla Merchant, a 39-year-old compliance manager who works remotely in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has experienced both in-person and online alternatives to happy hour. Her old law firm wanted to add perks for staff — as well as potentially bring down insurance premiums — and brought in a trainer to lead in-person workout classes for employees.\n\n\"A lot of us, we weren't super close before the workout class,\" Merchant said. The exercise enthusiasts were spread across departments and floors. She said she's still friends with some of the people she worked out with 15 years later.\n\nMerchant's experience isn't an anomaly. Business Insider reported in October that fitness studios like Barry's and F45 have seen a surge in corporate bookings. Barry's saw a 55% surge in its corporate events and bookings business compared to the year prior. F45 similarly shared that it went from booking an average of one corporate fitness event a month at an offsite or conference, to as many as four.\n\nOf course, the happy hour will likely never be fully vanquished. Getting together for a drink after a long day still very much has its appeal. Manhattan's infamous Stone Street is still drawing crowds, and workers in many major US cities spent more on happy hours in 2024 than they did in 2019. Some of that might be from fusing post-work drinking with more novel activities, like pickleball or blowing off steam in a rage room.\n\nCandice Pokk, a senior consultant for organizational effectiveness at benefits and HR consultancy Segal, said that she's seen increased interest in in-person events. \"Younger employees are craving experiences and not just freebies,\" she said, adding that she's seen organizations moving away from merely offering wellness perks like gym memberships or meditation app subscriptions, and instead investing in unique shared experiences for employees.\n\nCityPickle, which will soon operate a total of 25 pickleball courts across New York City, said the majority of its over 2,000 bookings this year have been corporate. Corporate off-sites, team bonding, and client events have become a major revenue driver, the company said — and that demand helped fuel the opening of its new flagship location in Times Square in February.\n\nThe 37,000-square-foot space, which will also serve as CityPickle's headquarters and its first year-round location, was a strategic choice given proximity to Midtown offices and transit access to major subway lines, said Mary Cannon, the cofounder of CityPickle. The venue includes seven courts, a bar and restaurant, event spaces, and coworking phone booths.\n\nCannon said happy hour isn't dead, but it has \"evolved,\" with companies increasingly choosing venues that offer more than just a bar.\n\nCityPickle isn't the only venue reimagining happy hour. At Break Bar NYC — which features an extensive nonalcoholic menu — coworkers end their drinks by hurling their glasses against a wall, sometimes with a photo attached. The space also has a projector that lets guests display images in the throwing arena.\n\nBreak Bar NYC, which evolved from a former rage room into a more traditional bar setting to reduce liability from injuries, draws individuals, after-work groups, small teams, and corporate buyouts, owner Tom Daly said.\n\nThe smashing is typically lighthearted, he said, with some managers opting to bring in photos of themselves or images of the software they use to attach to the glasses their employees shatter.\n\nSmashing objects with a hammer, sweating in a sauna next to your boss, or cheering on your coworkers as they hit the 2-minute mark in the cold plunge can unlock a different kind of team bonding.\n\nMyles Farmer, the cofounder of the cold plunge and sauna studio Othership, told Business Insider that as people shift away from solely alcohol-centered socializing, workers are seeking ways to connect more \"authentically.\"\n\nOthership operates in major cities like New York and Toronto and tends to attract workers aged 25 to 45 in fields including finance, law, and medicine, Farmer said. Many are \"really stressed\" or \"wound up,\" Farmer said, and the company has seen \"huge demand\" for corporate outings. He said workers are looking for a mental and physical reset without taking up too much of the workday.\n\n\"It provides community and connection, and then they're back out in the city and back to work,\" Farmer said.\n\nHe added that Othership, which has plans to open its largest New York location on the Upper East Side next year, has even become a place for workers to host meetings.\n\n\"People are looking at these as alternatives to getting to know someone,\" Farmer said.\n\nHappy hour alternatives can foster real, lasting connections — and in some cases, even romance. When Julia Bonacini, a 30-year-old LA-based commercial real estate finance professional, first started at her company, she befriended a coworker and learned they both loved Corepower. They started to go together, and another coworker soon joined in. When someone new arrived at the firm, he asked Bonacini to go hiking, and then to a yoga class. He then asked her out, though she initially declined.\n\nWhen he revealed to her that he had been interviewing elsewhere and was likely to put in his notice, she realized how much she'd miss him. They've now been together for two years.",

    "description": "The Toyota Highlander is getting a major reboot for 2027. It's a big deal for an automaker long seen as an EV laggard.",
    "fullText": "Toyota is turning the Highlander — one of its most established nameplates — into an EV.\n\nThe 2027 model is the SUV's first ground-up redesign in more than a decade and will be Toyota's first three-row EV for the US market.\n\nIt's also the first battery-electric Toyota to be assembled in America, with production set for Kentucky using US-made batteries.\n\nThe Japanese automaker, which lagged rivals Hyundai, General Motors, and Ford in rolling out EVs earlier this decade, is now rapidly expanding its US electric lineup.\n\nAs one of the brand's core urban SUVs — slotting between the top-selling RAV4 and the larger Grand Highlander and Sequoia — the Highlander's shift to battery power shows Toyota is betting big on electrifying its mainstream models, not just niche offerings.\n\nHere's what the upcoming American-made electric Highlander will look like:\n\nToyota is aggressively expanding and rejigging its EV lineup. This year, it's introducing the bZ Woodland and the C-HR while updating its bZ.\n\nIn 2027, families will have two options: a second-row set of captain's chairs that will seat six, or a bench setup with room for seven butts.\n\nThat puts Toyota in a very competitive market. It will now compete with Kia's EV9 and Hyundai's Ioniq 9. Premium buyers can also opt for the Rivian R1S, the Cadillac Vistiq, the Cadillac Escalade IQ, the Volvo EX90, and the Lucid Gravity.\n\nProduction for the Highlander EV is decidedly American.\n\nThe three-row is assembled at Toyota's Kentucky plant, where the automaker already makes the Camry and RAV4.\n\nBattery production is also in the US — batteries will roll out of the company's $13.9 billion North Carolina plant.\n\nAfter this year's RAV4 overhaul, the Highlander had become one of the oldest SUVs in Toyota's lineup. The outgoing model traces its roots back to 2013, with only a mid-cycle facelift in 2020.\n\nThe 2027 Highlander is a true ground-up redesign — and it looks the part. It adopts cleaner body lines, a more upright stance, squared-off wheel arches, semi-flush door handles, and full-width LED lighting in the front and rear.\n\n\"This new Highlander is designed to be a stylish, high-tech leader in the midsize SUV segment,\" David Christ, the vice president and general manager of Toyota North America, said in a press release.\n\nThe Highlander EV features a new 14-inch central touchscreen paired with a 12.3-inch fully digital driver display. Toyota Safety Sense 4.0 and the brand's latest Audio Multimedia system come standard.\n\nIt's a meaningful tech upgrade for Toyota, which has often trailed Detroit rivals in screen size and software sophistication.\n\nAs Ford and GM push subscription services, more advanced driver-assistance features, and larger digital displays, Toyota is signaling it intends to compete more aggressively in the digital arms race.\n\nWith the third row folded flat, Toyota says it offers 45.6 cubic feet of cargo space — roughly enough room for seven full-size suitcases. Even with all seats upright, there's still 15.9 cubic feet behind the third row. There's no front trunk.\n\nToyota is offering a fixed panoramic glass roof on both trims, which it says is the largest available window in its US lineup.\n\nToyota is keeping the lineup simple with two trims: XLE and Limited. The Limited comes standard with all-wheel drive and the larger 95.8-kWh battery, along with upgrades like ventilated front seats and rear sunshades.\n\nThe XLE offers more flexibility. Buyers can choose between a 77.0-kWh or 95.8-kWh battery, and pair it with either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive.\n\nAll-wheel-drive models are the most powerful, producing up to 338 horsepower, while the larger battery delivers the longest range.\n\nThe larger battery has enough juice to carry the Highlander EV up to 320 miles, Toyota says.\n\nRange on the smaller battery depends on the powertrain: the front-wheel-drive options can travel 287 miles, while all-wheel drive options top out at 270 miles.\n\nThe Highlander EV can also double as a backup power source.\n\nToyota is equipping the SUV with vehicle-to-load (V2L) capability — a first for a Toyota sold in the US — allowing owners to plug in appliances, tools, or camping gear directly into the vehicle's battery.\n\nIn practical terms, that means the Highlander could power a tailgate, a job site, or even provide temporary electricity at home during an outage.\n\nToyota is also adopting the North American Charging Standard (NACS) port, allowing it to plug into Tesla Superchargers — the largest EV charging network in the US.",

    "title": "These are the most Gen Z Olympics yet. Oversharing, activism, and AI are all on the podium.",
    "description": "Norway's Sturla Holm Lægreid overshared at the Winter Olympics with his infidelity confession. It's an example of how Gen Z has taken over the games.",
    "fullText": "Can you remember the last time a bronze medalist became the big story out of an Olympic event? Here's one for you: During his post-race interview, Norway's Sturla Holm Lægreid didn't talk about the run he'd completed, which earned him the bronze medal in men's biathlon. Instead, he chose to tell the world about how he cheated on his ex-girlfriend.\n\n\"I told her a week ago. And it's been the worst week of my life,\" Lægreid told Norwegian broadcaster NRK. \"Sports has taken a bit of a back seat these past couple of days. Yeah, I wish I could share this with her.\"\n\nLægreid later apologized to the gold medalist and his ex-girlfriend, saying he deeply regretted sharing about his breakup, in a statement through the Norwegian Olympic team. He didn't immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nHis impulse, however, is a particularly Gen Z one. Was it a public display of accountability? Maybe. Was it classic oversharing at work? Definitely.\n\nGen Z has been in the Olympics since 2016, but this winter feels like the first Olympics where they are truly dominating the competition. The median age of Team USA at this year's games is about 28. In banner sports like figure skating and snowboarding, the median age is closer to 23. The Gen Z energy is undeniable in how these athletes conduct themselves on the world stage. Whether it's oversharing about their relationships, speaking out on politics, or using AI in performance, it's the Gen Z Olympics, and we're just watching it.\n\nSome of Team USA's most high-profile athletes are Gen Zers. Skating's \"Quad God\" Ilia Malinin, 21, shares the same name as one of the main characters on the gay hockey romance show \"Heated Rivalry,\" a favorite of Gen Z lookalike competitions. On the women's side, does anyone look more Gen Z than alt-girl figure skater Alysa Liu? With skunk stripe hair, tooth gems, and a frenulum piercing, she reps the alt scene that's making a comeback with the youth.\n\nThen there's Liu's teammate Amber Glenn, whose career follows Gen Z's tendency toward late blooming. She's making her Olympic debut at 26, which is slightly older than the typical age for female figure skaters. Liu and Isabeau Levito — the third US women's figure skating teammate — are 20 and 18 years old, respectively.\n\nOf course, it wouldn't be Gen Z without a dash of political engagement and a public statement. Glenn, who is openly pansexual, directly addressed discrimination against the queer community under President Trump at a press conference on Feb. 4.\n\n\"I hope that I can use my platform and my voice throughout these Games to try to encourage people to stay strong,\" Glenn told reporters.\n\nWhen asked about the turmoil around ICE at a different press conference, members of the US ski team didn't shy away from voicing their opinions, either. Hunter Hess, 27, talked about the \"mixed emotions\" of repping the US while ICE raids were happening at home.\n\n\"There's obviously a lot going on that I'm not the biggest fan of, and I think a lot of people aren't. Just because I'm wearing the flag doesn't mean I represent everything that's going on in the U.S.,\" Hess said.\n\nThe Olympics aren't untouched by AI either — a Czech ice dancing pair used a music mix that was half AI-generated for their rhythm dance. It's also not the first time that these skaters, who are 19 and 22 years old, have used AI music for a routine, which at least shows they're pretty LLM-native and the Olympic Committee is okay with it.\n\nIf that grinds your gears a little, just be thankful Gen Alpha hasn't hit the scene yet. Can you imagine how many celebratory 6-7s we'll be subject to?",

    "title": "The US Air Force needs to buy hundreds of sixth-gen fighters and bombers to be ready for a China fight, airpower experts say",
    "description": "Without more aircraft to hit Chinese defenses, the Air Force might have to hold back, risking the military getting drawn into a slog, experts said.",
    "fullText": "The US Air Force will need a lot more next-generation fighter jets and bombers to fight a war against China, former pilots and airpower experts argued in a new report.\n\nThey said the Air Force will need to procure significantly more of the new and coming B-21 Raider bombers and F-47 fighter jets than it currently plans to buy. Insufficient numbers may force the service to operate conservatively, potentially giving China an edge in such a fight, they warned in a Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies policy paper out this week.\n\nThe report said that China's anti-access and area-denial network, together with its natural geography, creates sanctuaries from which its air and missile defenses can fire. The firepower available to Chinese forces within these sanctuaries could pose a threat to US forces, making eliminating them critical to US operations.\n\n\"The Air Force's stealthy bombers and fighter inventories have the survivability needed to penetrate high-density threat areas but lack enough sortie capacity for a conflict with China,\" wrote report authors Heather Penney and retired Air Force colonel Mark Gunzinger.\n\nThe authors propose that the Air Force field at least 200 B-21s and 300 F-47s, which would be roughly double the service's current plans. The Air Force has said it will purchase at least 185 of the F-47s developed by Boeing and at least 100 of the B-21s produced by Northrop Grumman. The Mitchell Institute identifies Boeing and Lockheed Martin as supporters.\n\nThe authors additionally recommended boosting procurement of Lockheed's fifth-generation F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter and Boeing's advanced F-15EX Eagle II.\n\nIn an virtual event discussing the new report, Penney, a former F-16 pilot, said that past conflicts in Korea and Vietnam, as well as Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine, have shown that unless militaries take out enemy bases and sanctuaries, they could end up stuck in wars of attrition, the gradual bleeding of personnel and resources and little movement on the battlefield.\n\nIn a conflict with China, the US would likely face more advanced air defenses than it did in last year's Midnight Hammer operation against Iran or this year's Operation Absolute Resolve against Venezuela. Without a greater reserve of aircraft, Penney said, Air Force tactics for targeting Chinese sanctuaries would likely have to be less aggressive to avoid unnecessary risk to a limited fleet.\n\nThe B-21 is in low-rate initial production, though the only deliveries have been test, not operational, aircraft, while the contract for the design and development of the F-47 fighter jet was only awarded last year.\n\nNeither aircraft is expected to be operational in significant numbers for years. In the meantime, the Air Force is dependent on older, though still capable, bombers like the B-52 Stratofortress, B-1 Lancer, and B-2 Spirit.\n\nThe Mitchell Institute said budget increases of at least $40 billion a year could support higher procurement rates, as well as the acquisition of uncrewed Collaborative Combat Aircraft, or \"loyal wingmen\" drones, which Air Force officials have said won't replace crewed planes but instead complement them.\n\nMultiple assessments have found the Air Force's fleet is the smallest, oldest, and least combat-ready it has been in decades. By the numbers, today's inventory of fighters, bombers, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft is a fraction of its Cold War strength.\n\nAt the same time, experts have highlighted that the Air Force has been under increased strain due to constant conflicts and missions. A US Government Accountability Office report from 2024 said continuous deployments had reduced Air Force readiness, personnel, equipment, and aircraft. The government watchdog agency found that the service was pursuing fixes to these issues, but the demand on these forces was still higher than capacity.",

    "description": "The shift to gold looks to be fueled by trade tensions between the US other nations, and concerns about the growing deficit, David Einhorn said.",
    "fullText": "Billionaire David Einhorn thinks gold is well on its way to becoming the world's ultimate reserve asset.\n\nThe Green Light Capital founder said he believed the metal had already begun to replace US Treasurys as the top reserve asset among the world's central banks, attesting to its safe-haven status and shakier confidence in the US macro and fiscal outlook.\n\nEinhorn pointed to reports that China has told its banks to scale back its holdings of US Treasurys.\n\nMeanwhile, central banks' appetite for gold has been rising in recent years, he added. Central banks around the world purchased around 863 metric tons of the metal in 2025, according to data from the World Gold Council.\n\n\"The Chinese have decided they want to sort of want to compete on a currency basis. The central banks around the world are buying gold. Gold is becoming the reserve asset as opposed to Treasurys, or it's kind of mostly even at this point,\" Einhorn said.\n\nEinhorn, who said his firm had been investing in gold for more than a decade, pointed to two issues in particular he believed were making gold more attractive as a long-term investment compared to Treasurys:\n\n\"Our thesis on gold over the longer term is that our fiscal policies and our monetary policies don't make any sense,\" Einhorn said, adding that the US's growing deficit is unsustainable.\n\nThe demand for US Treasurys has been solid at recent auctions, but investors have been preoccupied with the idea that the US is losing its dominance in financial markets for the past several years.\n\nWorries about de-dollarization — the idea that the US dollar is losing its status as the world's reserve currency — began to pick up steam in 2022, when Russia and other BRICS nations shifted away from the greenback after being targeted by sanctions.\n\nFears of a broader shift away from the US intensified when President Donald Trump introduced tariffs last year, triggering a \"Sell America\" episode among foreign investors that has continued to flare up periodically since. The sentiment has also popularized the debasement trade, with investors scooping up hard assets out of fear that the US dollar and other fiat currencies will lose their value.",

    "description": "A software veteran predicts that AI will eventually lead Big Tech companies to cut 50% of their engineers.",
    "fullText": "Software engineers are getting crushed by AI, and they think you're next.\n\nAI's ability to automate code is simultaneously making developers productive and overworked. One technologist said his job is harder than ever, lamenting that \"AI fatigue\" is real.\n\nThe good news is it won't last forever. The bad news is that's because most of them will be out of a job.\n\nSoftware veteran Steve Yegge predicts that AI will eventually lead Big Tech companies to cut 50% of their engineers. (He wasn't a total drag. Yegge offered advice to software engineers for avoiding the 'vampiric effect' of AI.)\n\n\"Ok, but I don't work in tech. Why do I care?\" you callously ask. (So cold!)\n\nWell, according to the people in the thick of it, AI isn't stopping with them.\n\nMatt Shumer, the CEO of an AI startup, warned AI's disruption will be \"much bigger\" than COVID. The post has racked up more than 69 million views on X, gaining traction outside traditional tech circles. Shumer spoke to BI's Brent D. Griffiths about the post and the fact that he (surprise!) used AI to help him write it.\n\nIt's worth noting Shumer's company specializes in AI personal assistants. He certainly benefits from getting people on board with AI. But that doesn't invalidate a lot of his points about workers needing to adapt to a rapidly changing environment.\n\nThere's a counterargument to the doomsday prophecy.\n\nMaybe engineering jobs are especially ripe for AI disruption?\n\nThe job, after all, is highly digital and requires hard skills, two factors that make it a strong candidate for AI automation.\n\nSoftware engineers have also been somewhat insulated from the tech-based disruptions the rest of us have endured and adapted to during the pre-AI times. A new tool here. A new app there. At some point, many of us have gotten numb to tech disrupting what we do. You just figure out how to adapt.\n\nMeanwhile, software engineers were living on easy street. You don't have to worry about the tools when you're the ones building them. For years, software developers enjoyed healthy salaries, good work-life balance, and fantastic job security.\n\nNow the tables are turned, and suddenly it's everyone's problem?\n\nI'm not suggesting AI won't impact the rest of us. For starters, entry-level jobs across the board appear to be on the chopping block thanks to AI. Consultants also seem ripe for some shakeups. And the legal industry is certainly feeling the heat.\n\n(I could mention journalism, but we were on the extinction list long before AI. When I started college in 2007, my professors all told me the industry was dying. Almost two decades later, we're still here. If anything, it looks like AI has created some high-paying jobs for writers.)\n\nAI might end up being massively disruptive for all of us, but at this point, we're all used to it.\n\nWhere do you stand on the AI doomsday prophecy?

    "fullText": "Today, Windows 11 powers over a billion devices and supports millions of apps across business, creativity, education, gaming and productivity. For decades, our commitment to openness and compatibility, in partnership with our global community of developers, has enabled a rich and enduring ecosystem. However, users are increasingly seeing apps override their settings, install additional software or alter core Windows experiences without their awareness or consent. And your feedback is clear: Windows must both remain an open platform and be secure by default — protecting the integrity of your experience regardless of the apps installed. Our developers and ecosystem partners echo this need. They have called for stronger, more consistent security foundations in the operating system. Windows is evolving to take more accountability to place you firmly in a consent‑first model by making app and AI agent behavior transparent, decisions reversible and access limited to clearly approved capabilities. At the same time, we remain committed to app compatibility and will provide developers with the tools and guidance needed to adapt to this strengthened security model.\n\nMicrosoft has made security a top priority, investing deeply through company‑wide efforts like the Secure Future Initiative to make Windows more secure by default and focused on helping organizations prevent, manage and recover from incidents through the Windows Resiliency Initiative along with our ecosystem partners. We’ve strengthened Windows with security controls designed to meet customer needs, delivered through capabilities like Smart App Control and Administrator protection. Building on this, we are starting new SFI efforts for Windows Baseline Security Mode and User Transparency and Consent in Windows. This establishes a more robust security model that advances app transparency and user consent, with features that make app behavior more visible and app permissions easier to understand and manage.\n\nWith Windows Baseline Security Mode, Windows will move toward operating with runtime integrity safeguards enabled by default. These safeguards ensure that only properly signed apps, services and drivers are allowed to run, helping to protect the system from tampering or unauthorized changes. Users and IT administrators will still have the flexibility to override these safeguards for specific apps when needed. Developers can also check whether these protections are active and whether any exceptions have been granted — giving them insight and control over the conditions under which their apps run.\n\nWith User Transparency and Consent, we are bringing a more consistent and intuitive approach to how Windows communicates security decisions. Just like on your smartphone, Windows will now prompt you when apps try to access sensitive resources — like your files, camera or microphone — or when they attempt to install other unintended software. These prompts are designed to be clear and actionable, and you’ll always have the ability to review and change your choices later. Apps and AI agents will also be expected to meet higher transparency standards, giving both users and IT administrators better visibility into their behaviors. These updates raise the bar for security and privacy on Windows, while giving you more control and confidence in how your system and data are accessed.\n\nWindows has a long-standing tradition as an open platform. We will continue to preserve what has made it successful: freedom to install any app and openness to every developer. Building on that foundation, Windows Baseline Security Mode and User Transparency and Consent are grounded in a set of principles that put users clearly at the center.\n\nWe recognize that change takes time. That’s why this will roll out through a phased approach guided by clear principles – developed in close partnership with developers, enterprises and ecosystem partners to ensure a smooth and thoughtful transition. We’ve already begun this work alongside some of them to shape the early direction. We’re learning and adjusting from their feedback and perspectives as we refine our approach to stronger security, user transparency and consent, and how this evolution of Windows supports their needs.\n\nJacob DePriest, CISO and CIO at 1Password, says, “We’re excited to see Microsoft’s commitment to hardening desktop app security by making app behavior more transparent and strengthening security by default. As more people continue to rely on SaaS apps, agents and AI-driven tools, clarity and consent at the operating system level are critical to protecting sensitive data without adding friction. The focus on user transparency and choice for security is something we deeply value at 1Password.”\n\nMichael Draper, VP of Global Consumer Trust at Adobe, says “Adobe has always taken a proactive approach to security and we are collaborating across the ecosystem to strengthen customer protection. These efforts align with our broader focus on trust and we appreciate the opportunity to work alongside companies that share this commitment to keeping people safe.”\n\nAlex Ionescu, Chief Technology Innovation Officer at CrowdStrike, says, “CrowdStrike is looking forward to being an early partner in the development of a new, more secure and resilient runtime model for Windows applications, which helps raise the bar for user security and privacy. When applications and agentic workloads are well-behaved and respect user consent settings with proper security boundaries, security software can better protect users from attackers with reduced performance overhead.”\n\nElise Murphy, Head of Game Security at Electronic Arts, says, “At EA, delivering great player experiences through fair and competitive play is foundational to how we build games. We support platform initiatives that build stronger foundations for security and integrity, and raise the cost of cheating.”\n\nRaycast is a popular productivity tool used by developers and professionals. Thomas Paul Mann, Co-founder and CEO of Raycast, says, “At Raycast, privacy and security have always been core to how we build. As a tool that works deeply with Windows, we believe users deserve full transparency about what apps can do. This matters even more as AI agents start to act on their behalf. We’re excited to support User Transparency and Consent and shape it together.”\n\nNow, we’re expanding the conversation to our broader community. Through upcoming blogs and dedicated feedback channels, we’ll invite you to engage with us, share your insights and help refine this journey. Together, we can strengthen the Windows ecosystem and build the next 40 years of innovation — grounded in trust, transparency and user consent.",

    "description": "Connecting AI agents to your database via MCP? You're missing half the picture. Add your app's source code to unlock domain-aware product insights.",
    "fullText": "Product managers, analysts, and developers are connecting their AI agents to databases via MCP. This can give some product answers—but it’s like looking at a blueprint of an apartment.\n\nA blueprint missings details about the rooms, the furniture and the people living in the apartment.\n\nYou’re missing your application domain language.\n\nYour application sourcode is what’s missing for you to see what’s going on inside the apartment.\n\nI will show examples adapted from real life work of how connecting an AI Agent to a copy of your application sourcecode and your application database allows to ask domain specific questions (thanks to the domain logic stored in the app source code) and leverage the latest application data (ideally from a production replica database connection) to generate insights and solve bugs.\n\nNew to LLMs, MCPs, agents? Read my primer for some core concepts.\n\nWhen your Agent has access to an MCP connected to your database and you ask it:\n\nHow many document extracts are complete?\n\nA database MCP like dbhub will allow the Agent to answer based on the limited visibility gained from the database layout. A blueprint. The Agent will do its best but probably fall in to guess work based on the limited context which in this case is just what the MCP can see (table, column names and data).\n\nAn MCP connected only to your application database won’t have access to your application / domain specific language.\n\nIt’s gonna add critical details to the blueprint of your apartment. The Agent will be able to tell where the furniture is and what each room really is. The Agent will be able to give better answers without guess work.\n\nAnd when the MCP is connected to a production replica… you’ll get live insights.\n\nI thought it would be interesting way to see the value and pitfalls of this approach trough real conversations I had with Claude Code. I simplified the domain and stripped the conversations from any internal metrics and nuances to respect client confidentiality.\n\nLet’s say your application handles thousands of document extracting informations. These extractions can be in several states. If you asked the following prompt to an Agent that’s just connected to your application database via a DB MCP mcp__appdb_prod_replica:\n\nhow many document extract records are pending?\n\nI'll query the database to count \"pending\" items. First, I'll locate the relevant extract tables/columns and confirm what \"pending\" maps to.\n\nPending wasn't explicitly defined, so the assistant will try to inferred it from the schema default (status default = 0) and validated by counting grouped status. This happen to be correct but what if your app defines \"pending\" differently (e.g., another field called progress or a status/progress combo)?\n\nHere the tool call to the DB MCP found multiple tables matching document extract... but he guessed the right one.\n\n\"Pending\" is likely represented by a default status value. I'll enumerate status values to confirm counts.\n\nIf \"pending\" corresponds to status = 0 (the column default), then pending items = 23,208. Full status distribution: 0→23,208; 1→143; 2→168; 3→19,029.\n\nSo the Agent made an assumption and it turns out it was correct. The value for 0 are the records in default / pending state.\n\nBut if I asked “how many document extract records are running?” the Agent would not find any reference about a “running” status and allucinate!\n\nhow many document extract records are running?\n\nI'll query the database to find records that are currently running. Let me first explore the relevant tables.\n\nI see a status column. Let me check the distribution of values.\n\nLooking at the status values, I can see four states: 0, 1, 2, and 3. Status 0 is the default (likely \"new\" or \"queued\"), and status 3 has the highest non-default count suggesting \"completed\". Between 1 and 2, status 2 has a slightly higher count—in most workflow systems, \"running\" or \"in progress\" states tend to accumulate more records than transient error states.\n\nThere are 168 document extract records currently running.\n\nWrong. The agent guessed status 2 means \"running\" based on workflow pattern assumptions. But status 2 is actually \"failed\" and status 1 is \"running\". A plausible-sounding explanation that's completely incorrect—the real answer is 143, not 168.\n\nSome might say “Yeah AI sometime is wrong, humans are wrong too”… yeah right but this Agent + DB MCP is going to Vegas! Its guessing is due to a limited architecture. But it’s very easy to enhance it.\n\nLet’s see what happens when you run the same prompt but giving the Agent access to the application source code.\n\nIn the following conversations Claude Code was running from a directory with a copy of the application sourcecode.\n\nI didn’t even tell it about it. It just found and used the application sourcecode to fill in the gaps in its context. Now the Agent with the application domain language can get us much more useful responses.\n\nhow many document extract records are processing?\n\nI'll search for document extract tables and check the status values to find items that are currently processing.\n\nLet me check the distinct status values to identify which one represents \"processing\".\n\nNotice Claude sees 0, 2, and 3—but no status 1. Rather than assuming like it did earlier, it now checks the application source code to understand what these enum values actually mean. (enums map the status numbers to meaningful sentences)\n\nLet me check the model to understand what these status values mean.\n\n- 0 = pending\n- 1 = running\n- 2 = failed\n- 3 = completed\n\nLet me confirm by querying specifically for the \"processing\" status (1).\n\n143 document extract records are currently processing.\n\nHere's the breakdown of all status:\n\nThis is a simplified example but with the same approach you can leverage your application domain language and generate any kinda of insights.\n\nIn a brand new context free chat I instead of the raw application sourcecode I gave access to a Repomix file instead of the raw sourcode.\n\nThink of raw sourcecode as a filing cabinet stuffed with folders. Repomix turns it into a single searchable document—an index the agent can scan in seconds instead of opening drawer after drawer.\n\nWe’ll end up with a similar result:\n\nuse the @repomix-output.xml with the appdb production replica and find out how many document extract records are processing?\n\nI'll read the repomix output file and search for information about document extract records and their progresses.\n\nLet me search \n\nI found the status enum. The document_extract_records table has a status column with values: pending (0), running (1), failed (2), completed (3).\n\nLet me query the database to find how many items are currently processing.\n\nBased on the database query, here are the results:\n\nThere are currently 143 document extract records in the \"processing\" status.\n\nThe system has:\n 23,208 items pending\n 143 items currently processing\n 168 items that failed to import\n 19,029 items successfully processed\n\nRepomix will allow you to package parts of your code in “AI-friendly” ways so instead of the full codebase you’d leverage only the context that is needed.\n\nTo replicate this workflow, you need to provide your Agent with two distinct “eyes”: one for your static logic (code) and one for your dynamic state (database).\n\nWe use the DBHub MCP to give the Agent a secure, structured way to explore the database. You can connect this to a local download of your db or for most up to date insights to an ssh-tunneled read-only production replica (that’s what I do).\n\nThe Agent needs to see your “Domain Language”—the enums and constants that live in your files.\n\nI use Claude Code integrated in VS Code, but several other agentic clients handle this workflow natively: Cursor (excellent codebase indexing), Cline and Roo Code (VS Code extensions), and Goose (CLI-first, built by Block). Any of these will work.\n\nDownload a snapshot of the database and connect your DB MCP to that local copy. You’ll lose real-time data but keep the domain language benefits.\n\nStart with just the codebase access. Have your agent generate queries based on the domain logic, then run those queries manually in your DB console. Show the value, iterate, build trust.\n\nThe solution: Curate what matters\n\nYou don’t need your entire codebase—just the parts that define your domain language:\n\nRepomix with filters - Use .repomixignore to exclude tests, vendor code, and UI components. Focus on app/models/, lib/, and domain logic.\n\nGit submodules - Create a separate “domain context” repo that pulls in only the relevant directories from your main codebase.\n\nManual selection - In Claude Code/Cursor, use @filename to reference specific model files instead of loading the whole project.\n\nFor the last 12 months I’ve been integrating this flow in my lead product role and enabling analysts and developers on my team.\n\nBut this approach leverages the domain language already present in your application source code. Combined with a powerful AI model and a DB MCP, it lets you ask domain-specific questions and generate meaningful product insights.\n\nAlways keep a critical mindset and observe these 3 pillars, even more meaningful now in the age of AI-generated content:\n\nNow you’ve seen how to effectively leverage your app sourcecode when using Agents and MCPs. An often overlooked detail that I hope will help you in becoming even more effective at generating product insights on your software with the help of AI.",

The two sides have only ever met once, in a friendly in March 2008 which NI won 4-1.\n\nA potential intriguing match-up is Northern Ireland being drawn in the same group as Republic of Ireland, who will also compete in next month's World Cup play-offs.\n\nThere have been just two meetings between the teams since the turn of the century.\n\nThe Republic won 5-0 in the now-defunct Nations Cup in 2011 and the two teams then played out a goalless draw in a 2018 friendly, with both games taking place in Dublin.\n\nNorthern Ireland have not faced the Republic of Ireland in Belfast since 1994.\n\nRounding off potential Pot 3 opponents are Romania, who also have hopes of featuring in this summer's World Cup as they take on Turkey in their play-off semi-final next month.\n\nNI have won just three of the nine meetings between the sides, with the last four ending in draws.\n\nThere are four groups containing four teams in Leagues A, B and C and two groups of three teams in League D.\n\nThe winners and runners-up in the four League A groups will go through to the quarter-final stage of the tournament to play over two legs in March 2027, with semi-finals and finals in June 2027.\n\nThere are also play-offs for promotion and relegation from leagues A-C at the same time in March 2027.\n\nThe best-performing teams in the Nations League that do not qualify for the 2028 European Championships from the qualification campaign will enter to play-offs to earn the final qualifying spots for the tournament.\n\nTopping Group C3 in 2024 gave Northern Ireland a backdoor route to the play-offs for the World Cup and doing well in League B could offer a similar passage to Euro 2028 if O'Neill's side do not qualify automatically.\n\nMatchday 3: 30 September-3 October\n\nLeague A quarter-finals: 25-30 March 2027\n\nLeague A/B and B/C play-offs: 25-30 March 2027\n\nFinal tournament: 9-13 June 2027\n\nLeague C/D play-offs: 23-28 March 2028",

    "description": "The Nations League does not carry the prestige of other competitions, but Thursday's draw still carries huge importance to Scotland and the Tartan Army.",
    "fullText": "Who needs the Nations League? Now Steve Clarke has ended decades of heartache and taken Scotland to the World Cup, does anything else matter?\n\nUnderstandably, ever since December's gala draw for the summer's finals in North America, every Scotland fan has been consumed with thoughts of facing Haiti, Morocco and Brazil.\n\nThe prospect of partying at the finals for the first time since 1998 has given long-suffering supporters plenty to savour and there's been no need to look beyond, nor anything definite to anticipate.\n\nThat changes the Nations League draw in Belgium on Thursday evening, when Scotland's opponents for matches in the second half of 2026 are confirmed.\n\nCompared to Fifa's festival of football, or even the Euros, it's small potatoes, of course, but these games could hold huge importance for tournaments to come and the development of the national team after their tests in North America.\n\nHow does the Nations League work and when is the draw?\n\nAnother plot twist in Scottish title race for the ages\n\nSince being introduced in 2018 in an attempt to add more structure to the international calendar and phase out meaningless friendlies, the competition has followed a familiar format.\n\nNational teams are split into four tiers based on promotion and relegation from the last edition, theoretically putting sides of the same level together.\n\nEach of these tiers are split into groups of four and there's promotion and relegation through the divisions. The best teams in League A then go on into a knock-out finals tournament the following summer with the champions crowned at the end. Simple.\n\nScotland played in the top flight in the last edition back in 2024 but finished in third place in their group behind eventual champions Portugal and Croatia. That put the national team in a play-off to fight for survival and defeat by Greece meant relegation to League B.\n\nRevenge on the Greeks was served in the successful World Cup qualification last year, of course, but Thursday's draw will put Scotland back in familiar territory in the second tier of the Nations League.\n\nScotland are in Pot 1 of the League B draw, but a quick look at the possible opposition puts paid to any ideas that it means an easy draw.\n\nHungary, Poland and Israel are the only sides Scotland cannot face, but with the likes of Switzerland, Republic of Ireland and Sweden as a potential group of opponents, fans won't be taking success for granted. Though do we ever?\n\nPot 1: Scotland, Hungary, Poland, Israel\n\nPot 2: Switzerland, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Austria, Ukraine\n\nPot 3: Slovenia, Georgia, Republic of Ireland, Romania\n\nPot 4: Sweden, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Kosovo\n\nScotland will play each opponent home and away, with the fixtures grouped into three double-headers in September, October and November.\n\nGroup winners are promoted automatically, runners-up go into a play-off against a League A side, third faces a relegation play-off and fourth takes a drop straight into League C.\n\nEven eight years after its introduction, the competition does not have the allure of its counterparts, but it is still an important part of the international calendar, especially for Scotland.\n\nHead coach Clarke has spoken repeatedly about how his players need to face strong opposition to keep improving.\n\nThis time around, they will not be playing Europe's elite, but competitive games against sides of a similar level present a good test and strong preparation for the next set of European Championship qualifiers.\n\nPromotion brings prestige, glamour games next time around and prize money, but arguably the real prizes come in how a successful campaign sets Scotland up for the future.\n\nThe seeding for qualification campaigns and finals is always a complicated affair, but there is one simple truth that applies to them all. Winning games pushes a team up the rankings and into a better position - and winning competitive games is more valuable than victory in friendlies.\n\nThere is also the importance of a good Nations League as a lifeline to reach major finals. Four teams who failed to qualify for the World Cup directly have been given a second chance through the play-offs due to their Nations League record.\n\nAnd let us not forget that Scotland's long exodus from a major finals was ended because of a Nations League lifeline – the emotion of the play-off victory in Serbia that sealed a place at Euro 2020 was only possible because of a strong campaign.\n\nIt should not be the case that the national team needs a similar chance to reach Euro 2028, but a horrible set of circumstances could arise that make Nations League success essential.\n\nAs co-hosts of the tournament, the idea of Scotland not making the finals and seeing fans of other nations celebrating at Hampden in unthinkable.\n\nHowever, with four nations hosting the finals, Scotland, England, Wales and Republic of Ireland all have to go through the qualification campaign.\n\nIn an ideal world, the national team succeeds there and books a place, with three group games at Hampden guaranteed.\n\nUefa has set aside two places for host nations who fail to qualify in an attempt to make sure all four are in the tournament proper.\n\nHowever, if more than two of the four fail to qualify automatically, it comes down to qualifying ranking and Scotland could conceivably miss out altogether.\n\nIn that specific case, having a play-off place banked from the Nations League would be heaven sent.\n\nThere is one other intriguing footnote to the draw: it could set up the opposition for the next Scotland head coach's first game in charge.\n\nClarke's contract expires after the World Cup and there is no indication if he will carry on in the job, regardless of what happens at the finals.\n\nIf Clarke does leave in the summer, his successor's first matches will be in the Nations League and a new era for the national team will begin when League B kicks off.\n\nBBC Scotland will have live text coverage of the Nations League draw from 17:00 GMT.",

    "description": "Ford CEO Jim Farley told salaried workers in a town hall meeting that they would be receiving bigger bonuses as initial quality of cars has improved.",
    "fullText": "Ford Motor Co.'s salaried workforce will see their biggest bonuses in years when the company pays them out next month.\n\nFord's white-collar workers will see bigger checks because the Dearborn-based company made substantial strides in meeting key metrics in 2025, especially on improving vehicle initial quality, meaning how good the car performs in the first 90 days of ownership.\n\nThis news comes a day after Ford reported its fourth-quarter and full-year adjusted earnings before interest and taxes plunged compared with the year-ago period, largely due to a fire at its key supplier of aluminum in New York, which disrupted Ford production of profitable pickups and SUVs. Also, Ford paid $2 billion added costs due to President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nOn Feb. 11, during a global town hall, CEO Jim Farley told the salaried workforce that the company surpassed key goals in 2025. Therefore, bonuses for last year, which will be paid at the end of March, will be based on a multiplier of 130%, Ford spokesman David Tovar told the Detroit Free Press.\n\nIt's a substantial bump from recent years. For 2024, for example, the multiplier was just 69% and for 2023 it was 84%, Tovar said.\n\nFord has a global salaried workforce of about 75,000 people. Its salaried bonuses are based on a set of specific metrics in key areas it must meet each year. Tovar listed a few as: adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, quality improvement, global electric vehicle sales and connected services sales.\n\nIf the company meets the metrics, the multiplier is 100%, if it exceeds them it is above 100% and if it falls short it is below 100%.\n\n“This year is above target,” Tovar said. “The quality metric was one of the biggest factors in achieving it because it’s initial quality. We’ve been saying our initial quality scores have been improving.”\n\nFord has struggled with recalls and set an industry record last year with 153 recalls, but those are for older vehicles already on the road and as Farley told the Detroit Free Press last October, initial quality is a better indicator that quality is improving.\n\nIn June, the J.D. Power 2025 U.S. Initial Quality Study, which looks at customers in their first 90 days of ownership, named Ford F-150, F-Series Super Duty, Mustang and Escape best in their segments for initial quality.\n\nFord CFO Sherry House told reporters on Feb. 10 last year the automaker had zero production losses during its vehicle launches due to defects.\n\nThe improvement will likely yield handsome rewards to Farley, too. His compensation is largely based on how well Ford performs and he hits company metrics set by the board of directors. For 2024, he saw his overall compensation drop to $25 million compared with $27 million in 2023, largely due to failing to meet quality improvement goals. Ford will reveal Farley's 2025 compensation in a government filing due out next month.",

    "fullText": "Entrepreneur and reality TV star Kimora Lee Simmons has spent around five years living in a legally contested $25 million Beverly Hills mansion purchased by her estranged husband with money he stole from 1MDB — a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund at the heart of one of the world’s largest multibillion-dollar frauds in history, The Post can reveal.\n\nSimmons has not made mortgage or rent payments in that time, per court docs, and she’s allegedly refusing to vacate the house.\n\nShe is claiming that her estranged husband, disgraced banker Tim Leissner, sold the property fraudulently and without authority to real estate moguls the Reuben brothers.\n\nThe seven-bedroom estate, which sits on 3.7 acres in the heart of Beverly Hills, can be seen, at least from the outside, in her current reality show, “Kimora: Back in the Fab Lane”.\n\nBut what will happen to the property remains unclear as the legal dispute enters its fifth year.\n\nThe ongoing civil dispute over possession, title and liability stems from the distressed refinancing and sale-leaseback of the luxury property.\n\nA trial-setting conference is slated for Feb. 25. (Leissner has yet to comment, or actively participate in the case, although he was personally served in New York on Aug. 14.)\n\nIt all comes as Leissner, a German national, surrendered to federal prison in Allentown, Pennsylvania, on Feb. 6 — eight years after he pleaded guilty for his role in the $4.5 billion fraud. Simmons has also been in the news, promoting her show.\n\nIn 2022, Leissner testified under oath that he bought the property, at 25 Beverly Park Circle, with $25 million that had been stolen from the Malaysian people.\n\nHe gave the testimony as the government’s star witness in the criminal trial of his former Goldman Sachs colleague Roger Ng in federal court in Brooklyn. Ng is currently serving a 10-year jail sentence for his role. There is no evidence or suggestion that Simmons was involved in 1MDB.\n\nNo one disputes that the $25 million Beverly Hills home was bought with stolen 1MDB money in 2017.\n\nBut the fact that Leissner did not have to forfeit the mansion is unusual — and it leaves the door open for Malaysia to demand it back from its current owners, along with any other assets that Leissner bought with stolen money, sources told The Post. And he has quite a few.\n\nThe massive fraud began in 2009 with the creation of a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad. Within days, $700 million had been siphoned out of it. That year, a Wharton dropout named Jho Low — described by US and international investigators and prosecutors as the fraud’s architect — began buying trophy real estate in Manhattan with stolen cash and throwing money around New York City clubs.\n\nThe Post was the first publication to mention Low by name, pointing out his high-rolling ways, which caught the eye of investigators, sources later told The Post.\n\nLow, who remains a fugitive, maintains his innocence but gave up around $700 million in assets to the DOJ without admitting guilt. He still faces criminal charges in the Eastern District of New York for money laundering and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations, and in DC for illegal campaign contributions.\n\nBut “if Low was 1MDB’s architect, Leissner was its engineer,” another source told The Post.\n\nThe six-year fraud — which benefited Malaysia’s then-Prime Minister Najib Razak, Low and others — was ultimately investigated by 10 different countries. And Leissner was arrested for his part in June 2018.\n\nAs the judge in Ng’s case said, “Leissner admitted to efforts to move and hide assets, including ownership of his entities like Keyway [the holding company for the Beverly Hills mansion] out of apparent concern the US government would seek to disgorge the Property as restitution.”\n\nThe Beverly Hills home is also unusual because other trophy real estate assets bought with stolen 1MDB cash have been seized — like Low’s New York and LA properties, including a $30.55 million condo on Columbus Circle.\n\nAnother penthouse, in Walker Tower at 212 W. 18th St., was bought for a record $51 million purchase in 2014 by Khadem al Qubaisi, who who was implicated in the fraud and is now in prison. The property was seized and sold by the US government for a paltry $18 million in 2020.\n\nCelebrities who were gifted pricey assets bought with stolen 1MDB money were also asked by the US government to return them in a record civil asset forfeiture case, and they did — mostly.\n\nTo date, the government has successfully recovered and repatriated around $1.4 billion to Malaysia — the largest recovery in DOJ history.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio, for example, returned a Picasso and a Basquiat worth a combined $12.2 million and Marlon Brando’s Oscar, worth $600,000, all gifted to him by Low with 1MDB money.\n\nBut Simmons’ home remains an outlier — and is now the subject of this messy court case.\n\nLeissner claimed in court in Ng’s 2022 trial that he sold his assets to Newland, a Hong Kong-based company.\n\nBut sources say Newland may have been a front company.\n\nIn November 2020, Leissner’s LLC, Keyway Pride, held by Newland, sold the Beverly Hills property to the billionaire brothers and real estate moguls David Reuben and Simon Reuben, after interest on a $12 million mortgage he had taken out to cover “living expenses” was not paid, according to a source with knowledge of the deal. The Reuben brothers declined to comment.\n\nAs part of the deal, Leissner and Simmons were also to pay $67,000 a month to continue to live in the property, according to court documents.\n\nHowever, Simmons “has been [living] there since November 2020 and no rent has been paid to date,” a source with knowledge of the deal told The Post.\n\nWhile Simmons later challenged the sale and leaseback of the property, in October 2020 she allegedly signed a Keyway resolution authorizing it, although she says her signature was procured through misrepresentation and abuse of trust by Leissner, according to the defendants’ complaint, filed in January 2021 — two months after the home sold to the Reuben brothers.\n\nSimmons’ lawyers and reps did not return requests for comment, nor did Leissner’s lawyer. In court testimony in the Ng case, Leissner said he continued to reside in the home after his 2018 arrest — he and Simmons have a 10-year-old son — but did not specify when he left.\n\nThe estranged couple no longer live together, sources say, adding that neither Leissner nor Simmons “have paid a penny” to live there.\n\nIn January 2021, Simmons filed a lawsuit in a Beverly Hills court. The ongoing case is between cross-defendants and plaintiffs Keyway Pride, Leissner and Simmons; and cross-plaintiffs and defendants 25 Beverly Park Circle Propco LLC, Cantervale Limited and Chicago Title Company.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Simmons claimed that the new owners of the house — the Reuben brothers — illegally bought the Beverly Hills house, because it was bought without her permission.\n\nNone of this drama, however, is part of Simmons’ new reality show, “Kimora: Back in the Fab Lane,” which features at least the exterior of the Beverly Hills home. In a clip promoting the E! reality series, she says: “My name is Kimora and I am a hoarder — but a luxury hoarder,” as she shows off her collection of 698 luxury handbags.\n\nSimmons once posted on social media about her friendship with Rosmah Mansor, the diamond-collecting, handbag-stockpiling wife of ex-Prime Minister Najib. Mansor has been compared to Imelda Marcos for the way she amasses luxury goods bought with stolen money. Simmons’ handbag collection is even larger than Mansor’s — although there is no suggestion Simmons’ was bought with stolen money.\n\nThat was not the case for Mansor. In May 2018, police seized her collection of 567 luxury handbags, shortly after Najib’s coalition lost the general election. Police were seen loading five trucks with orange Hermès boxes. Many of the handbags were ultimately returned; others were auctioned by the government, according to reports.",

    "fullText": "The recent airspace closure around El Paso, Texas, was caused by the U.S. Military shooting down a party balloon amid a behind-the-scenes spat with air safety officials, multiple reports say.\n\nThat contradicts the explanation provided on Tuesday by administration officials, which claimed the closure was necessary because drones operated by Mexican drug cartels were being downed as they crossed the southern border.\n\nFlights at the El Paso International Airport were grounded and inbound planes, including medical evacuation flights, were forced to divert 45 minutes away to Las Cruces, New Mexico, said the border city’s enraged mayor.\n\n“I want to be very, very clear that this should’ve never happened,” Mayor Renard Johnson said in a news conference on Wednesday. “You cannot restrict air space over a major city without coordinating with the city, the airport, the hospitals, the community leadership... That failure to communicate is unacceptable.”\n\nSources tell CBS News the dramatic shoot-down and airspace closure “stemmed from disagreements between the Federal Aviation Administration and Pentagon officials over drone-related tests,” suggesting friction between federal officials and the military.\n\nThe network’s sources said that Fort Bliss, which abuts the city’s airport, received new laser technology that the Pentagon, led by Defense Secretary Pete Hegeth, was itching to test ASAP to practice taking down drones.\n\nThe FAA, meanwhile, wished to hold meetings on “over safety impacts” scheduled for later this month, CBS reports. Sources also told The New York Times that the FAA had “concerns about the risks” the new anti-drone tech “could pose to other aircraft in the area.”\n\nNeither the Pentagon nor the FAA responded to requests for comment. Mexican officials say they have seen no evidence that a drone was shot down at the border.\n\nAirspace was initially announced as shut down in El Paso for 10 days, an unusual period for a commercial airport of that size, but it was reopened early Wednesday after it was determined there were no credible threats to air travel.",

    "fullText": "LIMA, Peru (AP) — The Trump administration on Wednesday expressed concern that China was costing Peru its sovereignty in solidifying control over the South American nation's critical infrastructure, a blunt warning after a Peruvian court ruling restricted a local regulator's oversight of a Chinese-built mega port.\n\nThe $1.3 billion deepwater port in Chancay, north of Peru's capital of Lima, has become a symbol of China's foothold in Latin America and a lightning rod for tensions with Washington.\n\nThe U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said on social media that it was “concerned about latest reports that Peru could be powerless to oversee Chancay, one of its largest ports, which is under the jurisdiction of predatory Chinese owners.\"\n\nIt added: “We support Peru’s sovereign right to oversee critical infrastructure in its own territory. Let this be a cautionary tale for the region and the world: cheap Chinese money costs sovereignty.”\n\nThe concern comes as the Trump administration seeks to assert dominance over the Western Hemisphere, where China has long built influence through massive loans and high trade volumes.\n\nThe Chinese government on Thursday strongly rejected the U.S. comments.\n\n“China firmly opposes and strongly deplores the U.S.’s blatant rumor-mongering and smearing of Chancay port,” said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian at a daily briefing in Beijing.\n\nChancay, along the Pacific coast, is part of Beijing’s Belt and Road initiative, an infrastructure program that has seen Chinese state-owned banks offer sizable loans or financial guarantees to construct seaports, airports and highways, among other projects, across multiple continents.\n\nAs Latin America's deepest port, Chancay is capable of berthing some of the world’s largest cargo ships traveling between Asia and South America. China has been Peru’s biggest trading partner for more than a decade now.\n\nChina’s state-owned shipping and logistics company Cosco, a majority shareholder in the port, dismissed the U.S. claims.\n\nIn response to questions from The Associated Press, it said the court ruling “in no way involves aspects of sovereignty\" and insisted that the port remains \"under the jurisdiction, sovereignty and control of Peruvian authorities, subject to all Peruvian regulations.”\n\nIt added there were plenty of Peruvian authorities monitoring the port's activities, including police forces, environmental regulators and customs officials.\n\nThe ruling issued Jan. 29 by a lower court judge orders Peruvian authorities to refrain from exercising “powers of regulation, supervision, oversight and sanction” over the port in Chancay.\n\nThe regulator, Ositran, which has oversight over all of the country's other major ports, said it would appeal the decision, arguing that there was no reason to exempt Cosco Shipping from the agency's oversight.\n\n“(Cosco Shipping) would be the only company providing services to the public that could not be supervised,\" Verónica Zambrano, president of Ositran, told a local radio station Wednesday.\n\nAlthough it's privately owned, the Chancay Port covers 180 hectares (about 445 acres) of Peruvian territory, Zambrano added, making it subject to government efforts to monitor and enforce compliance with local user protection standards.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 11 (Reuters) - India's stated intention to buy $500 billion of U.S. goods over five years under a trade deal is drawing scepticism, with ‌economists warning it could distort commercial procurement and sharply reshape New Delhi's trade balance.\n\nU.S. President Donald ‌Trump last week said he will slash tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50%, sparking relief in India. But he ​asked New Delhi to more than double its annual imports of U.S. goods in return.\n\nBilateral trade was $132 billion in 2024-25, with a roughly $41 billion surplus in India's favour.\n\nTrade experts and economists questioned whether $100 billion a year in imports was feasible without an explicit policy push that steers companies towards American suppliers.\n\n\"The math doesn't add up,\" ‌said Madhavi Arora, an economist at ⁠Emkay Global, calling the target more \"aspirational than realistic\".\n\nA joint statement issued by the two nations said India intends to buy $500 billion of U.S. goods - language that stops ⁠short of a binding commitment.\n\nBut Trump has shown little patience with countries that fall short, including a late-January move to raise tariffs on some South Korean goods back to 25% from 15% after saying Seoul failed to legislate ​an ​earlier deal.\n\nIndia aims to step up procurement of oil, ​gas, coking coal and aircraft from the U.S., ‌both nations said in the joint statement.\n\nArora cautioned such targets can imply a government nudge to private airline and corporate sourcing decisions, which may be inefficient.\n\nWhile India has cited large Boeing orders as part of the plan, some analysts say firms could still favour Airbus if commercial terms are better.\n\nIndian markets steadied after staging an initial relief rally, but economists said investors appear wary of the $500 billion headline.\n\n\"The markets seem ‌to be treating the $500 billion purchase intention with a ​degree of scepticism,\" said Dhiraj Nim, an economist at ANZ.\n\nThe U.S. is India's top export destination, ​accounting for nearly a fifth of the Asian nation's entire shipments in the fiscal ‌year 2024-25.\n\nIf exports hold near pre-tariff levels ​and imports rise sharply, India's ​largest bilateral surplus could shrink and widen its overall trade deficit. India had a total goods trade deficit of $283.5 billion in 2024-25.\n\n\"If it is a $100 billion every year, it will completely upset ​India's trade balance,\" said independent trade ‌expert Biswajit Dhar.",

    "fullText": "Apple (AAPL) is ramping up for an eventful spring. It's the kind of “quietly huge” setup that AAPL stock investors love.\n\nIt plans several launches. One big narrative will dominate. And the scoreboard couldn't be clearer.\n\nFor me, the narrative unfolds with the latest Apple earnings. CEO Tim Cook was dealing in superlatives when he described the December quarter as a “remarkable, record-breaking quarter.”\n\nApple reported $143.8 billion in revenue and said its installed base topped 2.5 billion active devices. That's the type of scale that makes even \"boring\" refreshes become important events in the ecosystem.\n\nBut the scoreboard is starting to shift. In the earnings call, Cook said Apple continues to see \"market pricing for memory increasing significantly.\"\n\nThe comments suggest that Apple is issuing a reminder: The next few quarters may be less about demand and more about protecting its margins.\n\nI am sure you've seen examples within your family of those who want to cling to their old, perfectly functional iPhones. The most common reason, at least in my experience, is that the new ones are too expensive.\n\nNow the biggest-name users connected to the iPhone are Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, and Mark Zuckerberg. I'm confident their wallets will not get lighter due to the newest version of the iPhone.\n\nHowever, Apple aims to prioritize the needs of the average user this time. It's why in the next wave, it wants to make things more affordable, focusing on margin growth to widen the funnel.\n\nThe launch of iPhone 17e is imminent, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.\n\nIt will carry four upgrades that matter in the real world. A19, MagSafe (as described by The Verge), Apple’s newer C1X modem, and its N1 connectivity chip are the upgrades included in what's launching “imminently.”\n\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\n\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\n\nQuantum Computing makes $110 million move nobody saw coming\n\nI bet you're thinking, \"Hey, I know a person who skipped the cheaper iPhone because it felt like a 'yes, but…' device.\" However, MagSafe is looking to shake things up with car mounts, wallets, charging stands, and the whole accessory ecosystem.\n\nAnd Apple is reportedly keeping the price at $599, targeting emerging markets and enterprise buyers. These buyers, in principle, care about reliability and total cost of ownership more than status.\n\nThe spring iPad story is simple and basic. The focus is on the same shells, with faster chips.\n\nThe entry iPad is expected to jump to A18, according to Mac Rumors. That will bring Apple Intelligence support to Apple’s cheapest tablet for the first time.\n\nIf you're the person everyone contacts when an older iPad begins to slow, this is the type of update that matters.\n\nA base model that can operate Apple’s AI features cleanly gives Apple a straightforward pitch for schools, families, and companies that purchase in bulk.\n\nHardware is responsible for selling units, but software sells trust.\n\nGurman’s reporting says Apple will release the first developer beta of iOS 26.4 the week of Feb. 23.\n\nSiri will also be available again after a lengthy wait. Apple Intelligence parts are likely to pop up there.\n\nThe recent upgrades are not eye-popping. I hate it when we speak in hyperbolic terms about any stock. That is what I like about the recent upgrades.\n\nMaxim upgraded Apple to buy from hold (PT $300).\n\nKGI Securities upgraded Apple to outperform from neutral (PT $306).\n\nSeparately, J.P. Morgan reiterated its overweight rating and lifted its target to $315.\n\nThe short-term push-pull trajectory is evident, though. Demand, all things considered, remains very strong. However, the pricing strain of components, particularly memory, is becoming more pronounced.\n\nApple is not traditional when it comes to revenue guidance.\n\nHere are two simple ways investors frame the next quarter.\n\nBack-of-the-envelope range (year-over-year growth off last year’s March quarter): Apple did $95.4B in fiscal Q2 2025 revenue. If Apple prints +10% to +12% YoY (roughly in line with where many sell-side expectations cluster), that implies about $104.9 billion to $106.8 billion this March quarter.\n\n“Street” snapshot (consensus-style framing): FactSet estimates cited by Investor's Business Daily peg the March quarter around $104.9 billion in revenue and $1.84 EPS.\n\nHowever, there is a margin factor as well. Apple is guiding toward a gross margin for the ongoing quarter at 48% to 49%; Cook is flagging memory expenses as a growing headwind beyond Q2.",

Attorney General Pam Bondi testified for hours on Wednesday. The hearing was Bondi’s first testimony before Congress since the Department of Justice released millions of files related to disgraced pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Fox viewers saw almost none of it, as in total, the Trump-friendly channel aired less than 10 minutes of her nearly 5-hour testimony. During the hearing, she was frequently combative, melted down at questions, and at one point refused to look Epstein victims in the eye as she faced questions about the Trump administration’s handling of the files, among other topics.",

    "description": "\"It is excellent news.\"",
    "fullText": "The U.K. government is introducing a monthslong ban on hunting brown hares during their breeding season.\n\nAs The Guardian reported, officials have passed a ban that will prohibit the shooting of brown hares from February to October, specifically targeting the hares' key breeding months.\n\nMary Creagh, the U.K.'s Minister for Nature, noted that the hunting ban will address significant animal welfare concerns regarding the brown hare. The measure aims to stop the annual killing of thousands of pregnant or nursing females and protect young leverets from starvation.\n\n\"Brown hares are a cherished part of our countryside, an iconic British species, and it's simply wrong that so many are shot during breeding season,\" Creagh told The Guardian. \"I am determined to stop the decline of this wonderful animal.\"\n\nIn many cases, certain species are targeted for hunting as a form of population control. Throughout the U.K., many residents participate in the shooting of brown hares due to a preconceived notion that the animal's population has ballooned out of control.\n\nHowever, data from the Hare Preservation Trust shows that brown hare populations in England and Wales have declined by more than 80% over the last 100 years. While the exact reasons for this decline are unclear, many signs point to the U.K.'s increased agricultural industry.\n\nAccording to George Eustice, the former Conservative environment secretary, the idea of protecting brown hares has been around for years. Despite this, a previously proposed hare hunting ban was blocked.\n\nEustice spoke to The Guardian about the importance of ensuring the brown hare's survival.\n\n\"The first principle of conservation is to protect species during their breeding season, so it is excellent news that the government will now create a modern close season on the shooting of hares,\" Eustice said.\n\nBrown hares are not only a crucial component of the food chain in the U.K., but they also play a role in grazing local vegetation. By enacting a temporary ban on the hunting of brown hares, the U.K. may be able to ensure the species continues to help protect its biodiversity.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers on Thursday that it believes the teenage daughter of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is close to being designated as the country’s future leader as he moves to ...",
    "fullText": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers on Thursday that it believes the teenage daughter of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is close to being designated as the country’s future leader as he moves to extend the family dynasty to a fourth generation.\n\nThe assessment by the National Intelligence Service comes as North Korea is preparing to hold its biggest political conference later this month, where Kim is expected to outline his major policy goals for the next five years and take steps to tighten his authoritarian grip.\n\nIn a closed-door briefing, NIS officials said they are closely monitoring whether Kim’s daughter — believed to be named Kim Ju Ae and around 13 years old — appears with him before thousands of delegates at the upcoming Workers’ Party Congress, said lawmaker Lee Seong Kweun, who attended the meeting.\n\nFirst appearing in public at a long-range missile test in November 2022, Kim Ju Ae has since accompanied her father to an increasing number of events, including weapons tests, military parades and factory openings. She traveled with him to Beijing last September for Kim's first summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in six years on the sidelines of a World War II event.\n\nSpeculation about her political future intensified last month when she joined her parents on a New Year’s Day visit to Pyongyang’s Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, a sacred family mausoleum displaying the embalmed bodies of her late grandfather and great-grandfather, the country’s first- and second-generation leaders. Some experts saw the visit as the clearest sign yet that she’s positioned to be the heir to her 42-year-old father.\n\nSouth Korean officials initially expressed doubt that she could be chosen as a North Korean leader, citing the country’s deeply conservative culture and tradition of male-dominated leadership. But her increasingly prominent appearances in state media have prompted a reassessment.\n\nIn its previous assessment of Kim Ju Ae’s status in September, the NIS told lawmakers that Kim Jong Un’s decision to bring her along on his trip to China was likely part of an effort to build a “narrative” possibly paving the way for her succession.\n\n“In the past, (NIS) described Kim Ju Ae as being in the midst of ‘successor training.’ What was notable today is that they used the term ‘successor-designate stage,’ a shift that's quite significant,” Lee said.\n\nAccording to Lee, the agency cited her growing presence at high-profile military events, her inclusion in the family visit to Kumsusan, and signs that Kim Jong Un was beginning to seek her input on certain policy matters.\n\nDespite her increased visibility in propaganda, North Korean state media have never published the name of Kim Jong Un’s daughter, only referring to her as his “respected” or “most beloved” child.\n\nThe belief that she is named Kim Ju Ae is based on an account by former NBA star Dennis Rodman, in which he recalled holding Kim Jong Un’s baby daughter during a trip to Pyongyang in 2013. South Korean intelligence officials believe she was born sometime that year.\n\nIn 2023, South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers that Kim Jong Un and his wife also likely have an older son and a younger third child whose gender is unknown.\n\nSince its foundation in 1948, North Korea has been ruled by male members of the Kim family, beginning with the country’s founder Kim Il Sung and followed by his son, Kim Jong Il.\n\nKim Jong Un was just 26 when he was officially named heir during a 2010 party conference, two years after Kim Jong Il suffered a debilitating stroke. Following his father’s death in December 2011, he was abruptly thrust into the throne with relatively little preparation.\n\nSome analysts suggest that Kim Jong Un’s decision to debut his daughter early possibly reflects his own experience of being rushed into power.\n\nKim Ju Ae’s first known visit to Kumsusan last month was also her father’s first visit to the site in three years. Given the palace’s status as a key symbol of the Kim family rule, the trip should be seen as a symbolic gesture by Kim Jong Un to present his daughter as his heir before his grandfather and father as he prepares for the major ruling party congress, said Cheong Seong-Chang, a senior analyst at South Korea’s Sejong Institute.\n\nThe Workers’ Party congress in late February, last held in 2016 and 2021, could provide a stage for Kim Jong Un to formalize his succession plans, possibly by giving his daughter the party’s first secretary post, its No. 2 job, although such a decision might not be immediately disclosed to the outside world, Cheong said.\n\nOther analysts question whether she would receive such a high-profile post or any formal party role, given that party rules require members to be at least 18.\n\nIf Kim Jong Un does use the party congress to cement his daughter as successor, the signs would be more subtle, said Koh Yu-hwan, former president of South Korea’s Institute of National Unification.\n\nFor example, the party may issue self-praise about how North Korea has survived longer than most other Communist states and credit that to how the country established a \"successful inheritance of the revolution,” he said.\n\n“If you see comments like that, it would be reasonable to think that Ju Ae has been cemented,” as heir, Koh said.",

    "fullText": "Ireland second row Joe McCarthy insists the squad retain \"a lot of belief\" despite last week's crushing Six Nations loss to France.\n\nAndy Farrell's side's hopes of reclaiming the title were significantly dented after leaving Stade de France empty-handed following the 36-14 defeat by the holders.\n\nWith the pressure to deliver having intensified before Italy's visit to Dublin on Saturday (14:10 GMT), McCarthy says Ireland are determined to issue an emphatic response to last week's misery in Paris.\n\n\"When you get a big enough loss like that you definitely haven't done a few things right,\" said the Leinster forward, who admitted Ireland were guilty of \"compounding errors\".\n\n\"It was a tough pill to swallow and it was a big opportunity to start the Six Nations, but you don't get a second chance.\n\n\"It was a tough review but we are focused on getting better. There is still a lot of belief in the group.\"\n\nMcCarthy was the player of the match in Ireland's 38-17 win over France in Marseille in 2024, but he has been guilty of ill-discipline in the two meetings since.\n\nDuring last year's defeat in Dublin, he was shown a yellow card for what attack coach Andrew Goodman later called a \"stupid penalty\" when he pulled back Thomas Ramos off the ball, leading to France's opening try.\n\nLast week, he gifted France a penalty in front of the Irish posts when he barged into Mickael Guillard from the side, allowing the hosts to stretch their lead by three points to 15-0.\n\n\"It was a poor penalty from me, definitely avoidable,\" said the 24-year-old, who made his British and Irish Lions Test debut last summer.\n\n\"They're the ones you don't want to give away. I was trying to make an impact or make a tackle and I got the timing wrong and tried to pull out, but it was just a poor penalty and it gave them three points.\n\n\"It was something I didn't want to be doing but it was poor judgement from me. The pressure's on you and they're on top of you, you're trying to stop it but I definitely could have avoided that one.\"",

Batter Joe Root questioned whether the pink-ball matches were necessary during the Ashes.\n\nThe 2026-27 winter is set to be particularly busy for England's multi-format players.\n\nAfter the home summer concludes on 27 September, they will play a 50-over tri-series in Pakistan, possibly also including Sri Lanka, from mid-October before travelling to Australia for a white-ball tour in November.\n\nIn December they have a three-Test series against world champions South Africa. That is scheduled to be part of a multi-format tour but the T20 leg, in particular, is in doubt because of a potential clash with South Africa's franchise T20 competition, the SA20.\n\nEngland will also play two Tests against Bangladesh in February, after which their players will likely travel directly to Australia.\n\nWarm-up matches are also likely before the South Africa and Bangladesh tours.\n\nEngland set to reject future pink-ball Ashes Tests\n\nAus-Eng 150th anniversary Test will be day-night match",

    "fullText": "For some years, it has been said, Great Britain has been punching above its weight in winter sports.\n\nNo ice track, few snowy mountains, and yet world champions, X Games medallists and World Cup podium finishes aplenty.\n\nBut right now, those punches are coming in the opposite direction - and they feel heavy.\n\nMany expected Team GB to be on the medal table by now, with at least three, perhaps four medals on the board. Instead, the total remains at zero.\n\nThere have been three agonising fourth-place finishes for freestyle skier Kirsty Muir, snowboarder Mia Brookes, and curlers Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds, while a solitary error cost figure skaters Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson dearly when they had been battling for a bronze in the ice dance.\n\nBut it has demonstrated just how tight the margins are.\n\nTake Muir, for example. Just 0.41 of a point was the difference between bronze and fourth place in the slopestyle.\n\nHad she not squatted on a landing on her final run, she would have made the podium.\n\nBrookes, meanwhile, knew she needed to go huge on her final big air run for a chance of a medal - and so she did.\n\nShe landed a competition-first backside 1620 trick - featuring four-and-a-half rotations - but over-rotated at the very last moment.\n\nHad she landed it cleanly, she would have won a medal.\n\nSometimes, those fine margins work in Great Britain's favour. Twelve years ago at the Sochi Games, snowboarder Jenny Jones won bronze - Team GB's first Olympic medal on snow - in the slopestyle by just 0.25 of a point.\n\n\"I could have very much been in fourth,\" Jones told BBC Sport.\n\n\"The girl who came fourth, she did a bigger trick than me, but she dragged her hand. On the day, I had done it cleaner. On any other day, she might have beaten me.\n\n\"There's lots more going on with the Olympics, mentally. It is that psychological element, it's a mindset.\n\n\"They are all so capable, and they can do these things, but it is about who has got that mental advantage on the day.\n\n\"We should not be disappointed at all in our athletes, we should be celebrating how well they are doing on a world stage. We have so much more to look forward to.\"\n\nHow British skeleton came back fighting after 2022\n\n'Several versions of success' - but women's curlers dream of medal\n\nHow Team GB is leading the way in curling's arms race\n\nBritain's best medal haul from a Winter Games is five - at Sochi 2014 and Pyeongchang 2018 - but before the Games, UK Sport said up to eight medals could be won.\n\nWhile eight now looks like it could be a stretch, a record-breaking Games is still on the cards, and Dame Katherine Grainger, chair of the British Olympic Association, says \"questions will be asked\" if that is not achieved - particularly given the £25.5m UK Sport has ploughed into Olympic winter sports over the last four years.\n\n\"Because it's public money, there's a responsibility for all of us to make sure the money that goes in is paid back,\" she told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We want to see great performances, inspirational performances, and that there's good value for money. I think the results will be brilliant and it will justify the investment.\n\n\"We know the potential is to attain a record number of medals, and if that potential is not achieved then we have a responsibility across all of us to understand where that went wrong.\n\n\"That potential is very real. There rightly will be questions if we do not achieve that.\"\n\nIt is too early to have those conversations, because all is not lost.\n\nTeam GB has plenty of medal chances still to come - and this is where we might see them.\n\nCompetition dates: 12 February (men's heats one and two), 13 February (men's heats three and four), 15 February (mixed team).\n\nMatt Weston is in sublime form and leads the men's skeleton after two of four races.\n\nHe's a two-time world champion and won three successive overall World Cup titles between 2023 and 2026.\n\nHe won five of seven World Cup golds this season, picking up silver behind team-mate Marcus Wyatt in the other two.\n\nGB's Weston in prime position to win skeleton gold\n\nCompetition dates: 13 February (women's heats one and two), 14 February (women's heats three and four), 15 February (mixed team).\n\nTabby Stoecker finished in a top-three position in all six official women's training runs, including twice in top spot.\n\nShe has one World Cup victory to her name and, with Weston, has two World Championship silver medals to her name in the mixed team event.\n\nStoecker and Weston will likely team up again when the event makes its Olympic debut on Sunday.\n\nCompetition dates: 13 February (women's), 15 February (mixed team).\n\nCharlotte Bankes was crowned world champion in 2021 and won the mixed team title two years later with British team-mate Huw Nightingale.\n\nShe has twice won the Crystal Globe - the overall World Cup title - and finished second in the standings in 2024 and 2025, the latter season curtailed by a broken collarbone.\n\nShe won her first race since returning from injury in January.\n\nSport: Freestyle skiing (halfpipe)\n\nCompetition dates: 19 February (qualifying), 21 February (finals).\n\nZoe Atkin is the reigning halfpipe world champion.\n\nShe has achieved three podium finishes from three starts on the World Cup circuit this season, including a gold.\n\nShe also won gold at the recent X Games.\n\nSport: Snowboarding (slopestyle)\n\nCompetition dates: 16 February (qualifying), 17 February (finals)\n\nMia Brookes came so close to a medal in the big air but has an arguably better chance in her preferred slopestyle.\n\nIn 2023, she became the youngest world champion in snowboarding history at the age of 16 with slopestyle gold.\n\nShe has won back-to-back big air Crystal Globes and won World Cup gold in December, as well as slopestyle gold and big air bronze at the recent X Games.\n\nSport: Freestyle skiing (big air)\n\nCompetition dates: 14 February (qualifying), 16 February (finals)\n\nKirsty Muir was devastated after missing out on a slopestyle medal but another shot is coming her way in the big air.\n\nShe is a two-time World Cup gold medallist, her second coming in the big air in Secret Garden, China, in November.\n\nAt the recent X Games in Aspen she won slopestyle gold and big air silver.\n\nCompetition dates: 11-22 February\n\nBruce Mouat's men's rink are the curling world champions, having also won the title in 2023.\n\nThey won three successive European crowns between 2021 and 2023, and silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nOn Wednesday, they beat China 9-4 in their opening match against China.\n\nKeep an eye out for Brad Hall's two-man and four-man sleds in the men's bobsleigh.\n\nThey have been no stranger to World Cup podiums in recent years and get their campaigns under way on 16 February (two-man) and 21 February (four-man).\n\nAt the curling, Jen Dodds will hope to brush off the disappointment of the mixed doubles with Team Morrison in the women's event, as they look to defend the gold medal won by Eve Muirhead's women's team in Beijing.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "Trent Alexander-Arnold endured a difficult start at Real Madrid but his prospects are looking up - and it might earn him a ticket to the World Cup.",
    "fullText": "When Trent Alexander-Arnold came off the bench in Real Madrid's 2-0 win against Valencia last weekend, there was much anticipation around the former Liverpool right-back's return.\n\nAfter another two months on the sideline, Real supporters had seen very little of the England defender this season.\n\nSince joining the Spanish side in June 2025, he has been limited to just 17 appearances in all competitions.\n\nTwo separate injuries have disrupted his rhythm and denied him the sustained run of games needed to build momentum and a connection with supporters.\n\nThe relationship he built with Xabi Alonso became redundant when the manager was sacked after less than eight months in charge.\n\nNow though, he is fit again and the timing feels significant. The season is entering its decisive stretch and Alexander-Arnold has the opportunity to reassert himself.\n\nWhy are Real Madrid players training in masks?\n\nHasty or a shrewd move? Madrid in shock at swift Arbeloa appointment\n\nAfter a strong Club World Cup, where he started five of Madrid's six matches, Alexander-Arnold began the 2025–26 season sharing right-back duties with Dani Carvajal.\n\nSpanish media praised his early performances, noting he \"showcased his trademark ability to drift inside from full-back\".\n\nBut his campaign was soon disrupted. A hamstring injury in Madrid's opening Champions League game in September put him out for seven weeks and was described by local media as \"a blow to Trent's new chapter\".\n\nHis comeback in November felt particularly poignant as he faced his former club Liverpool at Anfield.\n\nHe subsequently made five more appearances, with Spanish newspaper AS suggesting that \"the initial criticism [of Alexander-Arnold] revealed a lack of understanding of the footballing ability the England international has always possessed\".\n\nMomentum was building and fans were beginning to see the benefits of their star signing, but a thigh injury against Athletic Club in December left him injured and recovering for another two months.\n\nThe 27-year-old admitted he was \"absolutely gutted\".\n\nThat setback kept him out for 14 matches, until his long-awaited return last weekend.\n\nDespite only playing for the final 15 minutes of the match, Alexander-Arnold's return was met with largely positive reaction from supporters.\n\nOn social media, the Madridistas didn't hold back:\n\n\"Trent Alexander-Arnold's minutes against Valencia felt like a prime performance. Our style of play even changed!\"\n\n\"Trent Alexander-Arnold completely changed the game when he came on. Does he deserve to start every match?\"\n\n\"His passes are so satisfying. Football has missed him.\"\n\nThe brief but impressive appearance has raised expectations, especially with the first leg of Real Madrid's Champions League knockout tie against Benfica looming next week.\n\nYet head coach Alvaro Arbeloa was quick to manage the excitement, emphasising that full recovery remains the priority.\n\n\"After being out for a long time, we are taking the same approach with him as with others returning from injury,\" said Arbeloa.\n\n\"We are proceeding cautiously and calmly because what we want is for him to find his rhythm, his best playing form. That's how it will be with Trent.\"\n\nIt was the first time Arbeloa had publicly addressed Alexander-Arnold, and the comments put to rest earlier rumours suggesting he might not feature in his long-term plans - speculation that Real Madrid had carefully shielded the England international from.\n\nThis was a clear signal that Alexander-Arnold remains central to the club's long-term vision. And, as a former Liverpool and Real Madrid right-back himself, Arbeloa may be uniquely placed to help strengthen their relationship off the pitch.\n\nWith Federico Valverde moving back into a central midfield role following Jude Bellingham's recent injury, Real Madrid's right-back picture has shifted, opening the door for Alexander-Arnold to feature more prominently in that position against Benfica and beyond.\n\nArbeloa now has all his options available on that flank: captain Dani Carvajal, Alexander-Arnold (who played ahead of Carvajal against Valencia), Valverde as an emergency option, and academy player David Jimenez, who started in Valencia.\n\nCarvajal's season has been equally frustrating, having battled a series of injuries as well as knee surgery.\n\nDespite now being fit and available, he has barely played any minutes under Arbeloa. In fact, his last start was in September. It's a complex situation given his contract expires in the summer and there appears to have been little progress in renewing it.\n\nThat context places Alexander-Arnold in a strong position to become Madrid's leading option at right-back once fully fit, with Valverde still available as an emergency alternative and Jimenez also impressing when called upon.\n\nWhether Alexander-Arnold will be eased back into the starting XI as he builds fitness, or whether he will leap straight into a key role, given the significance of upcoming fixtures, remains to be seen as Arbeloa manages the reintegration.\n\nIt would be fair to say that, at this stage of the season, Alexander-Arnold's chances of making England's squad for this summer's World Cup appear slim, with his limited minutes at club level the most obvious reason.\n\nInternational selection is usually built on form and fitness, and the England coaching staff are likely to prioritise players who are consistently competing at the highest level.\n\nHe has not had the chance to demonstrate the consistency required to challenge for a place.\n\nHe was omitted from Thomas Tuchel's World Cup qualifying squad in August, with the England coach saying: \"There's no doubt I'm a big fan of Trent, for his talent and his personality. But for this call-up, I've gone with Reece James and Tino Livramento.\n\n\"I know he wanted to be here, which is very important. I just chose others due to competition.\"\n\nEven if Alexander‑Arnold delivers spectacular performances for Real Madrid over the coming weeks, the competition for the England right-back position remains strong.\n\nWith Tuchel preparing to finalise his squad for friendly matches against Uruguay and Japan on 27 and 31 March respectively, selections are likely to prioritise players who have been performing consistently week in, week out.\n\nStill, as Tuchel himself emphasised: \"He's a great player who will always be in contention.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Thomas Tuchel commits to two more years as England manager, which will take him through to Euro 2028.",
    "fullText": "Thomas Tuchel has extended his contract as England manager through to Euro 2028.\n\nThe German took charge in January 2025 on a deal that was scheduled to run until this summer's World Cup.\n\nTuchel said it was \"no secret to anyone that I have loved every minute so far\" and that he was \"very happy and proud\" to continue in the role.\n\nThe 2028 European Championship finals are being hosted by England, Wales, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland, and it is understood Tuchel views leading the side into a home Euros as a rare opportunity.\n\nFor its part, the Football Association (FA) was keen to ensure continuity and remove speculation over Tuchel's future heading into the World Cup.\n\nThe 52-year-old had been strongly linked with Manchester United, where Michael Carrick is in charge until the end of the season.\n\nIt was not the first time he had been viewed as a potential manager at Old Trafford and Tuchel is said to have met with United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe in France in 2024 when the club were considering replacing Erik ten Hag.\n\nFA CEO Mark Bullingham said Tuchel's extension would ensure the England squad and staff were fully focused on the World Cup.\n\n\"We know the players are right behind him, and the togetherness within the group is there for all to see,\" said Bullingham.\n\n\"By securing them early for 2028, we have taken away the potential distraction of contract negotiations around the tournament.\"\n\nLast November Tuchel said the England role had \"re-energised\" him and that he would be open to extending his time in charge, having initially been the driving force behind signing an 18-month contract that would give him time to see how he felt in the job.\n\nIn a statement announcing his new deal, Tuchel said he had received so much support from the FA and fans \"that I did not hesitate when asked to continue in this dream job\".\n\n\"Euro 2028 will be a very special tournament and as a coach there is nothing more you want than to compete with the very best on the biggest possible stage,\" he added.\n\nTuchel's backroom staff - Anthony Barry, Henrique Hilario, Nico Mayer and James Melbourne - have also signed contracts through to summer 2028.\n\nTuchel guided England to eight wins from eight matches in World Cup qualifying and they will play Croatia, Ghana and Panama in their group at the finals.\n\nNews of his extension coincides with the former Chelsea manager attending Thursday's draw for the 2026-27 Nations League.\n\nWhen Thomas Tuchel took charge of England it seemed like it was going to be a quick in and out.\n\nThe German signed an 18-month contract to see him through England's World Cup campaign.\n\nThen, he was expected to return to club management.\n\nThe former Borussia Dortmund, Paris St-Germain, Chelsea and Bayern Munich coach would likely have had the pick of many top jobs in the summer.\n\nManchester United and Tottenham Hotspur are just two clubs who would have had him on their radar.\n\nInstead, he has committed his future to the Three Lions.\n\nThe England job has proved to be an excellent fit for the 52-year-old.\n\nBefore the November internationals, Tuchel said he had enjoyed \"the level of support and trust\" the Football Association offered. So we should not be surprised he has now decided to stay on.\n\nTuchel has always spoken highly of the Premier League but could not walk away from leading England at a home tournament.\n\nIt is good news for the FA, too. The last thing it wanted was to deal with months of speculation not only over Tuchel's position, but who would replace him.\n\nNow it can plan for the home Euros with continuity, and a coach who has got results.\n\nIt is not without pitfalls, of course. If England underperform at the World Cup, questions over his future will be asked.\n\nBut Tuchel's record so far means both parties do not see this as a risky move.",

    "fullText": "Matt Weston underlined his status as the world's best skeleton pilot by setting the track record on his way to taking a significant halfway lead at the Winter Olympics.\n\nThe two-time world champion - Team GB's biggest medal hope in Milan-Cortina -put down a statement second run to open an advantage of 0.30 seconds over the field, with two medal-deciding runs to come on Friday.\n\nWeston was the only slider under 56 seconds as he clocked 55.88secs in heat two, to add to his 56.21secs in run one on the new Cortina sliding track.\n\nAfter a frustrating opening run, which began with a costly bump against the wall near the top of the track, Weston was clearly annoyed with his performance.\n\nBut, under pressure from two German sliders, he tidied up those errors with a slick and highly impressive second run, shaving 0.33secs off his opening effort, to give him an overall time of one minute 52.09secs.\n\n\"I was quite annoyed after the first run. I tried to be a bit too relaxed because I tried to over-compensate for race-day nerves,\" Weston said.\n\n\"It's pretty crazy [to be the overnight leader] but I take every run as run one. I will completely reset myself, switch off for a bit and then re-focus on Friday.\"\n\nGiven skeleton medals are often decided by hundredths of a second, Weston's fist pumps at the end of his second run were not only a sign of his elation at a cleaner run, but also marking the significance of his advantage.\n\nCompatriot Marcus Wyatt sits seventh with a combined time of 1:53.21 - 0.66secs outside of the medal places.\n\nWyatt, 34, was also a strong medal contender coming into the Games but has struggled on the technical Cortina track and a podium-finish already seems like a tough ask.\n\nAxel Jungk, silver medallist in Beijing four years ago, is in second place with a time of 1:52.39 while fellow German and defending Olympic champion Christopher Grotheer is third with 1:52.55.\n\nThe final two heats will take be shown live on the BBC from 18:30 GMT on Friday with all four run times added together to give an overall result.\n\nWeston arrived in Cortina as Team GB's best hope of a gold medal but now has the added pressure that he is likely to be chasing a first medal of these Games for the British team following a series of misses for the nation's other hopefuls.\n\nHe has been the dominant slider of recent seasons on the global stage, claiming five race wins and two further podium finishes this season as he won a third successive World Cup title.\n\n\"I have taught myself to love the pressure and love the expectation I have on my shoulders,\" Weston said.\n\n\"I didn't like it when I first had success, but now I have turned it into fire that I can go out and give my best.\"\n\nThe build-up to the Olympic event was dominated by 'helmet-gate' - with the British team hoping to a wear a new design in Italy.\n\nThe helmet was banned by the sport's governing body - the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Foundation (IBSF) - who said it did not comply with rules around shape as the back of the helmet protrudes, giving an aerodynamic advantage.\n\nThe British team lost an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) to overturn the decision, meaning they could not wear them at the Games.\n\nThe athletes said they were unphased by the issue and pointed out that all of their success this season has come with the old helmets.\n\nGB have long been a dominant force in skeleton, winning medals at every Games since the sport was reinstated to the programme in 2002.\n\nThat was until 2022, when Team GB failed to win a medal in what was a disappointing Olympic campaign in Beijing.\n\nWeston's 15th-place finish was the highest of the four British athletes competing on the Yanqing track with Wyatt coming 16th.\n\nWeston thought about quitting the sport after that but four years later looks primed to fulfil his promise on the Olympic stage.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Suns’ Dillon Brooks puts refs on blast after 16th technical foul appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nPHOENIX– Dillon Brooks was more mad than anyone in the locker room ever saw him postgame. The normally laid-back, stoic forward had an intense look in his eyes and was taciturn in his responses.\n\nThey were all centered around his 16th technical. He leads the league in that category, but in his defense, referees are quicker to give Brooks a technical foul than other players.\n\nHe stated that official Jason Williams said that he was playing the victim too much, and that’s why he picked up his 16th. But he was soon asked how he handles the frustration of the officials watching every move.\n\n“Consistency,” he said vehemently. “If you’re going to be consistently bad, then be consistently bad throughout the whole game. Don’t try to fix it during the game.\n\n“Don’t be trying to do any of that or try to even out foul calls or whatever the case might be. If you’re going to be bad, be bad the whole game.”\n\nI followed up and asked Dillon Brooks how he handles his frustration when the officials perceive him the way they do.\n\n“If you’re going to be consistently bad, then be consistently bad throughout the whole game. Don’t try to fix it during the game. Don’t be trying to do any of… pic.twitter.com/oncbOjHlx8\n\n— Hayden Cilley (@HaydenCilley) February 12, 2026\n\nThe foul comes at a very crucial time. It took place during the last game before the All-Star break. Although Phoenix will look to rest up, if the foul stands, he won’t be able to play until Saturday against the Orlando Magic.\n\nAnd as the rule goes, for every other technical foul (18, 20, 22, etc.) there will be an automatic one-game suspension. With how valuable Brooks is to the Suns, there might be ways to be cautious.\n\nHe mentioned possibly not even talking to the officials at all during the game. Finding any kind of temporary solution can help with a potential playoff push.\n\nAlso with Devin Booker, Jalen Green, and the rest of the team looking to be fully healthy, every person matters, especially Brooks.\n\nPerhaps the backend of the season can entail a toned-down version of Brooks’s intensity for the sake of not picking up any more technical fouls.",

    "fullText": "The struggles Kyle Busch has faced over the last two seasons are no secret, but on Sunday, NASCAR could see him climb back atop the mountain of relevance once again. After winning the pole position for the 2026 Daytona 500, the fire in Busch appears to be reignited, and he is hungry to win.\n\nFor a while now, Busch has endured repeated setbacks with little sign of light at the end of the tunnel. However, something feels different in 2026. The veteran is clear about what he wants and why he wants it.\n\nThat clarity could end up being the engine that drives him back toward greatness once again.\n\nBusch said, after winning the Daytona 500 pole, “Seeing my son and the passion that he has, he really, really is probably my biggest cheerleader. He wants to see me run well. He wants to see me win races. He wants to celebrate in Victory Lane like he sees other drivers’ kids being able to do.\n\n“So there’s nothing more that drives me every single weekend than seeing him see me, be proud of me,” the Richard Childress Racing driver stated.\n\nBusch’s son Brexton, 10, is already following in his father’s footsteps in motorsports. He has made quite a name for himself, winning dozens of races across multiple disciplines. And what kid would not want to see his father standing atop the hill as the king? Busch appears to be using that sentiment as motivation to pull himself out of the rut he has found himself in.\n\nThe 2026 season marks Busch’s fourth year with Richard Childress Racing, and he will be supported by the talent and experience of crew chief Jim Pohlman, who won the Xfinity Series championship with JR Motorsports in 2024. Rest assured, he knows exactly what he is doing.\n\nHopefully, Brextonwill not have to wait long to celebrate with his father in Victory Lane. From the looks of it, that moment could come as early as this weekend. The two-time Cup Series champion clocked a lap of 49.006 seconds at Daytona International Speedway to win the pole position.\n\nBusch will share the front row with Joe Gibbs Racing driver Chase Briscoe. It will be his 21st career start in the Daytona 500 and his first time starting the race from the pole. The stars appear aligned for Busch’s return. All that is left to do now is go out there and execute.\n\nThe post “Nothing Drives Me More”: Kyle Busch Reveals What’s Fueling His Push to Win Again in NASCAR appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "Former Blue Jays starter Chris Bassitt agreed to terms on a one year, $18.5 million contract with the Baltimore Orioles today. Bassitt, who turns 37 next Sunday, spent the last three seasons with the Blue Jays. He was originally drafted by the White Sox, but spent the bulk of his MLB career as an Oakland A, with a one year stint with the Mets before signing in Toronto.\n\nHe was effective last season, making 31 starts and posting a 3.96 ERA over 170.1 innings. He moved to the bullpen for the playoffs, logging a 1.04 ERA over seven appearances and 8.2 innings and was a solid contributor to the World Series run. Overall, he gave the Jays 541.1 innings with a 3.89 ERA. That innings total ranks ninth in the majors over the past three seasons, while the ERA was 5% better than league average. He was exactly the kind of workhorse #3 they’d hoped for when they signed him, and it was great to have him on the team.\n\nWith the additions of Dylan Cease and Cody Ponce early in free agency, it doesn’t seem like the team was serious about bringing him back, though. With Cease, plus Kevin Gausman signed for one more year, the emergence of Trey Yesavage, and (theoretically) Shane Bieber also taking a spot, he’d have had to battle with Jose Berrios for the #5 spot even before the Ponce signing. Given his track record, it makes sense that he’d pursue a more guaranteed starting job.\n\nIt’s unfortunate for us that that job comes in Baltimore. The Orioles project to have one of the best offenses in baseball, with homegrown starts Adley Rutschman, Gunnar Henderson, and Jackson Holliday paired with free agent slugger Pete Alonso, but their rotation is a weak spot that had looked like it might keep them out of the top tier of AL contenders. Bassitt gives them a steady hand to back up the mercurial Shane Baz and the talented but often injured Trevor Rogers at the top of the rotation. He doesn’t solve a lack of top end pitching talent, and they still project behind the Yankees, Jays and Red Sox, but the gap is closed a bit and the AL East becomes even more of a gauntlet.\n\nThat aside, I wish Bassitt well. He was a great addition to the team while he was here, and seemed pretty likeable. I hope he pitches well enough to be traded to a contender in the NL at the deadline.",

    "fullText": "Follow our live coverage of the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nChloe Kim, the snowboarder who has been setting the bar high over the years, will attempt her third gold medal on Thursday in hopes of continuing her strong legacy. The U.S. and Canadian hockey teams will take the ice indoors as the men begin their tournaments and return to Olympic action for the first time since 2014.\n\nWhile Norway leads the gold medal count with seven of the 13, the United States is up to four gold medals (seven total) so far in Italy, and will have several opportunities to add to that count on Day 6 of the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nLet’s take a look at everything to watch today.\n\nTime: 7 a.m. ET, 1 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: The women’s 10km interval start freestyle brings another good chance for Diggins, the American star in her final season, to win a medal. She has several World Cup wins over 10 kilometers and was the world champion in 2023.\n\nTime: Canada at 10:40 a.m. ET, 4:40 p.m. in Italy; U.S. at 3:10 p.m. ET, 9:10 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: American and Canadian NHL stars return to the Olympic ice for the first time since the 2014 Sochi Games. Canada opens against the Czech Republic, also known as Czechia, while the U.S. takes on Latvia in the nightcap. Two other games Thursday: Switzerland-France at 6:10 a.m. ET and Germany-Denmark at 3:10 p.m. ET.\n\nTime: 1:30 p.m. ET, 7:30 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: Kim will be chasing a third gold medal, and the competition will be chasing her. The key question will be whether she lands her most technically ambitious runs under Olympic pressure and how close the field can push her to perform at her best, as riders attempt to shorten the gap. Even when Kim isn’t perfect, her scoring ceiling often forces competitors to take bigger risks, setting up a final that could hinge on execution and nerve as much as difficulty.\n\nTimes: 3:05 a.m. (women), 8:05 a.m. (men) and 1:05 p.m. (women) ET; 9:05 a.m., 2:05 p.m. and 7:05 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: The U.S. and Canada women make their debut in the morning session. The Americans are up again in the evening session. Great Britain vs. Sweden highlights the afternoon men’s session.\n\nTimes: 3:30 a.m. ET; 9:30 a.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: The opening two heats will set the tone for a race where hundredths of a second can define medal hopes. With athletes making their first Olympic runs down the track, early consistency and clean starts will be crucial, especially as sliders balance aggression with control on one of the fastest courses in the world. Pressure will likely be on medal favorites to avoid mistakes while leaving little margin for recovery heading into the final runs, as Heats 1 and 2 will separate the good and great.\n\nTimes: Qualification No. 2 at 4 a.m. ET, 10 a.m. in Italy; final at 6:15 a.m. ET, 12:15 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: Demanding combinations of speed, aerial difficulty and technical precision will be tested as qualifiers kick off. The event rewards skiers who can maintain clean, controlled turns while attacking the course with aggression and executing high-difficulty jumps, so expect the competition to hinge on how athletes balance speed with form, as even small mistakes in the bumps or landings can swing scores dramatically. With judging split among turns, air and time, the event often produces tight finishes and momentum swings as finalists try to deliver high-risk runs under pressure.\n\nTimes: Qualification at 4 a.m. ET, 10 a.m. in Italy; final at 7:45 a.m. ET, 1:45 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: Strategy, positioning and clean starts are often just as important as raw speed, as riders jostle for lanes and try to avoid crashes that can quickly eliminate medal favorites. The knockout format adds another layer of pressure, forcing competitors to balance aggression with control while navigating traffic at high speeds, making snowboard cross one of the Games’ most volatile and dramatic events. Keep an eye on USA’s Nick Baumgartner, Australia’s Adam Lambert, Austria’s Alessandro Hämmerle and Canada’s Éliot Grondin.\n\nTime: 10:30 a.m. ET, 4:30 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: Norway’s Ragne Wiklund, Canada’s Isabelle Weidemann and Joy Beune of the Netherlands are among the best in the women’s long-distance race. Italy’s Francesca Lollobrigida is the reigning world champion, giving the host nation a medal hopeful. Dutch great Irene Schouten, the defending Olympic champion, has since retired.\n\nTime: 12:30 p.m. ET, 6:30 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: Germany and Austria lead the field after strong individual results, but one misstep or sloppy transition can swing the podium. Keep an eye on Germany and Austria’s consistency, which earned them a lead so far. Star power and making every run and handoff will be critical, but they won’t necessarily carry each team to victory.\n\nTime: 2:15 p.m. ET, 8:15 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: It could be a big day for North America here, with Americans Corinne Stoddard and Kristen Santos-Griswold and Canadians William Dandjinou, Steven Dubois and Courtney Sarault all among the medal contenders. Pietro Sighel gives Italy a medal shot in the men’s 1,000. Two-time world champion Xandra Velzeboer of the Netherlands is the name to beat in the women’s 500.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nOlympics, Global Sports, Women's Olympics\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "One man’s trash is another man’s treasure. Just ask Endrick Felipe Moreira de Sousa.\n\nBorn in Taguatinga, Brazil, Endrick moved to Palmeiras’ academy at a young age, where he rose through the ranks and single-handedly lifted his family out of poverty. After scoring 165 goals in 169 games for Palmeiras youth teams, Endrick ascended to the first team and established himself as one of the best talents in world football, scoring 21 goals in 82 appearances for the Verdão and leading them to two league titles.\n\nRead the full article by subscribing to Ensemble PSG on Substack\n\nIt wasn’t long before the likes of Gabriele Marcotti were starting to describe him as a future world-beater, and it’s why Real Madrid snapped him up for an initial fee of €35 million, plus €25 million add-ons and €12 million in taxes. By the time he joined, he was already a full-fledged international for Brazil’s senior team and a strong contender for the team’s starting center forward position.\n\nAfter arriving in the summer of 2024 following his 18th birthday, Endrick made a swift transition to life in Spain, becoming the youngest foreigner to score for the club in La Liga’s history (aged 18 years and 35 days) and the youngest player to score for Real Madrid in the UEFA Champions League, as well as the first player since Cristiano Ronaldo in the 2012–13 season to score five goals in a single Copa del Rey campaign for Real Madrid.\n\nUnfortunately for Endrick, he missed out on the FIFA Club World Cup after suffering a hamstring injury, prompting him to miss out on the first few weeks of the Xabi Alonso era. While Gonzalo García exploited the opportunity and finished as the tournament’s top scorer, Endrick returned as the club’s third-choice striker.",

    "fullText": "The Arizona Cardinals made Mike LaFLeur their new head coach. While it took a while, it has largely been looked at positively. It is seen largely as a solid hire, as it seems that anyone who has ever worked for Rams head coach Sean McVay has success.\n\nHowever, if one report is true, LaFleur was not the guy the Cardinals really wanted.\n\nAccording to Jason La Canfora, the Cardinals badly wanted to hire Klint Kubiak, now the head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders after he was the offensive coordinator for the Seattle Seahawks, the newly crowned world champions.\n\nThe Cardinals were willing to wait and were ready to open up the pocketbook and pay him. It wasn't enough, though.\n\nArizona was incredibly high on Kubiak, and, like the Raiders, were willing to wait until after the Super Bowl to hire him. The franchise, notorious for being beyond frugal when it comes to coaching expenditures, were also willing to make a significant allotment to his salary and his assistants, but Kubiak chose the Raiders instead, a decision that was not particularly difficult, according to some involved in the process.\n\nWhy the Raiders? Minority owner Tom Brady was a factor. So was having the first overall pick in the 2026 draft. And another factor was being able to get out of the NFC West.\n\nWhile this report doesn't come from a large outlet, this would explain the Cardinals' process. They interviewed LaFleur but really wanted to speak with Kubiak, seemingly hoping to sway him their way.\n\nWhile it seemed like the whole world knew Kubiak wanted the Raiders' job, the Cardinals wanted to shoot their shot, ultimately failing.\n\nThis isn't to say that LaFleur won't work out. The Cardinals just wanted Kubiak more.\n\nNow we will see which coach is able to turn things around better and more quickly.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "Dillon Brooks gets honest about his relationship with referees 'Said I'm playing victim' originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThroughout his career, Phoenix Suns forward Dillon Brooks has had a rocky relationship with the referees. He is the type of player who loves talking trash to his opponents because that is just how his personality is. Brooks loves throwing his opponents off their game, but he gets penalized for it often.\n\nAgainst the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday, the Suns lost the game 136-109. Brooks had a decent performance, scoring 23 points, grabbing five rebounds, and dishing out four assists. Unfortunately, he was called for his 16th technical foul, which will result in a one-game suspension.\n\nUnfortunately for Brooks, he has a reputation with the referees. That has followed him throughout his career, which led to him clashing with the officials. On Wednesday, it was referee James Williams, who has become widely known around the league as the Gucci Mane lookalike.\n\nDuring the game, Williams gave Brooks a technical foul, which was his 16th of the season. That means he won't be present in the Suns' next game against the San Antonio Spurs on the second night of a back-to-back.\n\nMORE: Dillon Brooks receives support from teammate for All-Star push after recent performances\n\nBrooks dislikes his relationship with referees because he feels he is getting picked on now. It is not a good thing that he keeps picking up technical fouls, but sometimes, Brooks knows that it is more of his reputation doing the work, and not something he did on the court.\n\n\"Focus on the game. He said I'm playing victim all the time. When I don't play the victim, I'm a bad guy. Choose one... We haven't won a game with Gucci reffing... that should be on notice... We've had him 4-5 times already,\" Brooks said about his relationship with referee Williams.\n\nIt is not a good look for Brooks, but if he is telling the truth, reputation does play a big role for these players. Despite Brooks standing out as one of the breakout stars of the season, he continues to retain his reputation. Unfortunately, that will affect the Suns, as they look to win more games.\n\nKnicks, Suns inquired about Spurs' Jeremy Sochan at trade deadline\n\nSuns owner Matt Ishbia fires back at Bill Simmons over prediction\n\nSuns' Devin Booker gets 'one of the best players in the world' praise from NBA legend\n\nDillon Brooks calls out Draymond Green and Paul George for podcasts while still in the NBA\n\nDraymond Green takes another swipe at Dillon Brooks",

    "description": "“The hope, then, is that Sunderland Women’s long‑term vision will eventually align with the ambition of its supporters”, writes Charlotte Patterson.",
    "fullText": "The January transfer window in the WSL and WSL2 is rarely a quiet affair, but this year’s edition felt especially revealing. It exposed the widening gap between clubs with resources to reshape their squads mid‑season and those who must operate with caution, creativity, and a heavy reliance on internal development. It also highlighted the shifting ambitions across the division, with some sides aggressively strengthening for promotion pushes or survival battles, while others, notably Sunderland, opted for a more restrained approach that has left supporters both understanding and quietly frustrated.\n\nThe WSL2 is a league defined by its contradictions: home to clubs with Premier League backing and others reliant on community‑driven models; a division where ambition often outstrips budget. The January window, then, becomes a mirror, reflecting not only squad needs but also the structural realities each club faces.\n\nSo let us explore each team’s business, the motivations behind their moves, and the broader patterns emerging across the league. Then turn to Sunderland: our limited activity, the reliance on loans, the understandable but still disappointing lack of permanent additions, and the unavoidable comparison with Newcastle’s headline‑grabbing recruitment drive. It asks the question many Sunderland supporters have quietly pondered: could more have been done? And if not, what does that say about the club’s ambition for its women’s side?\n\nFew clubs approached the window with as much intent as Birmingham City. Their business was extensive, ambitious, and clearly designed to elevate the squad for the second half of the season. The arrivals of Asato Miyagawa from Hammarby and Michaela Kovacs from Vålerenga added international pedigree and defensive solidity, while Wilma Leidhammar from IFK Norrköping brought attacking threat and versatility. Hannah Silcock from Liverpool strengthened the midfield, and Lotta Lindström from London City added further depth.\n\nShanade Hopcroft’s arrival from Crystal Palace was one of the more intriguing moves of the window, offering creativity and WSL2 experience. Birmingham’s recruitment strategy was clear: build a squad capable of competing at the very top of the division, with a blend of youth, experience, and international quality.\n\nTheir outgoings were equally notable. Ebonie Locke, Poppy Irvine, Tegan McGowan, Ava Baker, Lily Agg and Riya Mannu all departed, either permanently or on loan, as Birmingham reshaped their squad with purpose. This was a club making a statement, one that suggested they see themselves not merely as contenders, but as a side determined to return to the WSL.\n\nBristol City’s window was defined by quality rather than quantity. Katie Robinson’s arrival from Aston Villa was a standout signing, bringing pace, directness, and top‑flight experience. Lauren Brzykcy from Piteå and Oliwia Woś from Nürnberg added defensive stability, while Camila Sáez from West Ham strengthened the spine of the team. Jessie Gale from Arsenal rounded out a window that felt measured, intelligent, and aligned with Bristol’s long‑term vision.\n\nTheir outgoings, Tianna Teisar and Malaika Meena, were modest in comparison, suggesting a club that feels confident in its direction and sought only to refine, not overhaul.\n\nCharlton have been one of the Championship’s more ambitious sides in recent seasons, and their January business reflected that. Katie Lockwood from Glasgow City and Lizzie Waldie from Hearts added experience and leadership.\n\nThe departure of Zoe Barratt to AFC Bournemouth was the only significant outgoing, leaving Charlton with a strengthened, more balanced squad. Their recruitment was purposeful, reinforcing their status as a club with genuine promotion aspirations.\n\nCrystal Palace’s window was one of the most eye‑catching in the division. Hayley Ladd’s arrival from Everton was a major coup, a player with WSL pedigree, leadership qualities, and the ability to control games from midfield. Kelly Brady from Athlone Town and Lucy Newell from Manchester United added depth and versatility across the pitch.\n\nShanade Hopcroft’s departure to Birmingham and Isabella Sibley’s arrival at IFK Norrkoping did raise eyebrows.\n\nDurham’s window was quiet but defined by targeted, sensible additions. Dee Bradley from Burnley added defensive steel. Lily Agg’s arrival from Birmingham provided experience and composure in midfield.\n\nDurham rarely overhaul their squad mid‑season, preferring continuity and cohesion, and their January business reflected that philosophy. It was understated but effective, the kind of window that strengthens a squad without disrupting its identity.\n\nIpswich were one of the busiest clubs in the division, and their window reflected a club determined to establish itself at WSL2level. Colette Cavanagh from Deportivo, Lucy Ashworth‑Clifford from Lazio, and Lysianne Proulx from Juventus were headline arrivals, bringing international experience and technical quality.\n\nKit Graham from Tottenham, Kenzie Weir from Everton, and Ava Baker from Birmingham added depth and versatility, while Nelly Las from Leicester and Malaika Meena from Bristol City strengthened the midfield. Princess Ademiluyi from Gotham FC was one of the more exciting signings, offering pace and unpredictability.\n\nTheir academy‑focused additions, Nina Meollo and Ruby Seaby, reflected Ipswich’s commitment to youth development. This was a window that blended ambition with identity, positioning Ipswich as a club determined not to go back down.\n\nNewcastle’s window was, unsurprisingly, the most dramatic in the division. Their recruitment was loud, ambitious, and financially assertive, a reflection of a club with Premier League backing and a clear desire to climb the women’s football pyramid quickly.\n\nKaitlyn Torpey from Portland Thorns, Emilia Larsson from Rosengård, and Simone Charley from Orlando Pride were marquee arrivals, bringing international pedigree and attacking firepower as well as, Ashanti Akpan from Southampton.\n\nNewcastle’s business was not subtle. It was a statement of intent, a declaration that they intend to challenge for promotion immediately. Their window stood in stark contrast to many of their WSL2 rivals and, inevitably, to Sunderland.\n\nForest’s window was one of the most intriguing. Libby Smith, Joy Omewa, Alana Murphy, Leanne Kiernan, Rebekah Dowsett, Cerys Brown, and Olivia Johnson all arrived, giving Forest one of the most extensive recruitment drives in the division.\n\nTheir outgoings, Caragh Hamilton to Sunderland and Casey Howe to Wolves, were notable, but Forest’s overall business suggested a club intent on consolidating and climbing the table. Their recruitment blended experience, youth, and international talent, positioning them as one of the window’s most active and ambitious sides.\n\nPortsmouth’s window was modest but purposeful. Charlie Estcourt last at DC Power and Lucy Shepherd from Dallas Trinity added attacking options, while academy development registrations for Niamh Peacock and Evie Milner reflected a commitment to youth.\n\nPortsmouth’s business was not headline‑grabbing, but it was coherent, the kind of window that strengthens a squad without overstretching. Especially as they fight to survive.\n\nSheffield United made two key additions: Simone Sherwood from Leicester and Tammi George from Wolves. Both signings added depth and experience, particularly in midfield and defence. They also added loan signings in Scarlett Hill from Manchester United and Shauna Guyatt from Ipswich Town. It was a quiet window, but one that addressed specific needs.\n\nSouthampton’s window was defined by only one arrival: Tegan McGowan from Birmingham City. A player who brings energy and technical quality, strengthening a squad that has been steadily building over the past two seasons.\n\nSouthampton’s recruitment reflected a club with growing ambition, one that sees itself as capable of challenging the established order.\n\nAnd then we come to Sunderland, a club whose January window has sparked more debate, frustration, and introspection than perhaps any other in the WSL2.\n\nSunderland’s business consisted of two loan signings: Mared Griffiths from Manchester United and Caragh Hamilton from Nottingham Forest. Both are talented players, both will contribute, and both fit the club’s long‑standing philosophy of promoting youth, developing talent, and operating sustainably.\n\nBut it is also fair, and entirely human, to feel a sense of disappointment.\n\nWhen other clubs around you are making permanent additions, strengthening decisively, and generating excitement among their supporters, it becomes difficult not to compare. And when that comparison includes Newcastle, the contrast becomes even starker.\n\nNewcastle’s window was a spectacle. Sunderland’s was quiet.\n\nNewcastle’s business was a statement. Sunderland’s was pragmatic.\n\nNewcastle’s ambition was visible. Sunderland’s was implied, internal, and, to many supporters, insufficiently expressed.\n\nThe question many Sunderland supporters have asked is simple: could we not have brought in someone else? Someone permanent? Someone who could change games?\n\nGiven Sunderland’s position in the league, competitive, ambitious, and within touching distance of something meaningful but also something catastrophic, it would not have been unreasonable to expect at least one marquee addition. A creative midfielder. A clinical forward. A defender with top‑flight experience. A player who could turn tight games in Sunderland’s favour.\n\nBut football is rarely that straightforward. It is entirely possible, even likely, that Sunderland were in talks with players. Negotiations may have taken place. Targets may have been identified. Deals may have been close. But for whatever reason, finances, competition, timing, player preference, they could not get them over the line.\n\nThis is the reality of operating in a league where resources vary dramatically. Sunderland’s model prioritises sustainability, internal development, and long‑term planning. It is a model that has produced results, but it is also one that can feel limiting during transfer windows, especially when rivals are making bold moves.\n\nThere is also the broader, more uncomfortable question: does the club match the ambition of its supporters when it comes to the women’s team?\n\nSunderland’s women’s side has enormous potential, a rich history, and a passionate fanbase. But potential alone does not win promotions, and passion alone does not sign players. The reliance on loans, while useful, does not build long‑term squad stability. It fills gaps but does not lay foundations.\n\nAnd while promoting from within is admirable, and something Sunderland do exceptionally well, and I myself personally am proud of and love to see, it cannot be the only strategy if the club wants to compete with the likes of Newcastle, Birmingham, or Charlton.\n\nThe frustration, then, is not rooted in entitlement but in aspiration. Sunderland supporters know what this club can be. They know the talent within the squad. They know the potential of the academy. They know the passion of the fanbase. And they want the club’s ambition to match that potential.\n\nThis January window, unfortunately, did not feel like a step in that direction.\n\nThe WSL2 is evolving. Clubs are investing more, the standard is rising, and the gap between the top and bottom is widening. Ambition is becoming a competitive advantage, and those who invest wisely are reaping the rewards.\n\nSunderland are at a crossroads. Their identity as a club that develops young talent is a strength, but it must be complemented by strategic recruitment if they are to keep pace with the division’s most ambitious sides. The January window highlighted this tension: the desire to remain sustainable versus the need to be competitive.\n\nIt is entirely possible that Sunderland will still achieve their goals this season. The squad is talented, cohesive, and well‑coached. But the window was a missed opportunity to add that extra spark, that game‑changer, that player who could turn draws into wins and narrow losses into points gained.\n\nThe 2025/26 January transfer window in the WSL2 told a story of ambition, caution, and contrast. Some clubs strengthened boldly, others quietly, and a few, like Sunderland, left supporters with mixed emotions.\n\nIt is not unreasonable to feel disappointed. It is not unreasonable to compare. And it is not unreasonable to want more for a club with Sunderland’s history, potential, and identity.\n\nBut it is also important to acknowledge the complexities behind the scenes. Deals fall through. Budgets are finite. Philosophies shape decisions. And sometimes, the moves you want to make simply cannot be made.\n\nThe hope, then, is that Sunderland’s long‑term vision will eventually align with the ambition of its supporters. That the club will invest not just in its academy but in its first team. That future windows will bring not just loans but permanent additions. And that Sunderland will take their place among the WSL2’s most ambitious clubs, not just in spirit, but in action.\n\nFor now, the season continues. The squad remains strong. The potential remains enormous. And the story of Sunderland’s ambition is still being written.",

    "fullText": "It’s fair to say that Brobbey was absolutely marshalled out of the game by Liverpool’s centre-halves yesterday. He’s often a huge source of attacking intent and influence for the team but wasn’t able to get a foothold in the game against two players in Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté who neutralised his main qualities in a way we hadn’t seen up until now. Van Dijk may get more of the headlines due to his decisive goal but Konaté’s display was absolutely immense throughout. The block he made for Brobbey’s shot in the first half and the tackle he managed as Brobbey looked to get free in the box were examples of elite defending from a player who has struggled massively at points this year. It’s a shame that he decided that he wanted to elevate his levels to unplayable heights when visiting the Stadium of Light but sometimes that’s just what top players do.\n\nI thought that Brobbey’s overall performance was still at a reasonable level yesterday which further highlights how impressive the two big lumps at the heart of Liverpool’s defence were. Van Dijk was imperious in the air at both ends of the pitch, too, resulting in the aforementioned winner — something which we haven’t seen too much this year, especially when Ballard is on the pitch. I believe that VVD is the only player in the league to outperform Ballard on aerial statistics this season and he demonstrated that prowess fully.\n\nA real lack of attacking quality\n\nI think the quality on the pitch was sorely lacking from a Sunderland perspective yesterday, unfortunately. The lads put a lot of heart and effort into the performance overall but the gulf in quality was evident on the night, with Liverpool’s players frankly able to outplay ours in nearly every position. I don’t think that the performance deserves outright criticism but I do think that it was a disappointment to not push Liverpool any further than we did. It seemed like a very easy night for them, which is not something many of our opponents would be used to thinking this season, especially after coming to the SoL. As always, Enzo was at the heart of anything positive that we managed to knit together, and I felt that the performance was generally solid for a good portion of the game without ever looking threatening.\n\nThere was a real lack of incisiveness about the lads’ play across the 90 yesterday wherein opportunities to try an ambitious flick or touch, or simply to try a more difficult pass through the lines were consistently turned down in favour of playing the safe option around our own defence without much intent or endeavour. It’s something we’ve seen often in away performances recently but it seemed to seep into our home performance yesterday — to sum it up: flat.\n\nThe unbeaten record falls to the reds\n\nWell, there it goes. It was a record that we can all be immensely proud of the lads for achieving and it’s something we could never have expected to have at this stage of the season. The team had earned that record through a lot of hard work and graft, representing the badge like we’d hoped a team would for years and years. The fact that the streak is over doesn’t make us a bad team and doesn’t mean that the Stadium of Light will be an easy place for teams to come in the future — I have a lot of faith that our home form can drive us throughout the rest of the campaign.\n\nIt’s worth remembering that Liverpool are the reigning champions of the league and while they haven’t been at their scintillating best throughout the entire season, they showed that they can still be excellent on their day.\n\nOne positive coming out of the defeat was the debut of our newest tricky winger in Nilson Angulo. Starting in what seems to be his favoured position off the left, he offered much more in a 1v1 sense than I think any other winger has this season. He’s clearly got quick feet but also has a raw power and athleticism which both impressed me in the moment and makes me think that he could definitely have a great impact going forward. There were multiple occasions where Angulo was doubled up on and through his own feints and movement made it into a promising move, often taking the second defender out of the equation while at it.\n\nAnother aspect of Angulo’s play which was highlighted ahead of his arrival was his defensive work rate which was on display tonight. Despite Liverpool’s ability to carve open good opportunities concerningly easily across the night, Angulo found himself helping out Reinildo a lot on that left-hand side against Salah, helping to double up in defence and blocking crosses into the box. It’s something that Régis will clearly have enjoyed and a trait which will certainly improve his chances of keeping his place in the starting XI.\n\nIt’s not something I like to dwell on too much, but Xhaka’s influence was sorely missed yesterday. That lack of drive and intensity going into the latter stages yesterday was not seen while he was on the pitch throughout a season filled with comebacks at home. Oftentimes, Xhaka is at the core of that late push — a mentality that is difficult to replicate and drum up in his absence. Our entire system, especially when chasing a game, relies on Xhaka playing that pivot role perfectly as we sweep from left to right in order to find a punishing gap. The second balls were lost constantly yesterday, and it meant we just couldn’t build up an imposing momentum against Liverpool, who sat in safely before managing the quick and threatening counters that we couldn’t when they had dominated us.\n\nIt seems like Granit will be out for around another three weeks and with him likely needing to rebuild his fitness, we’ll have to find a way to regain that intensity when finding ourselves behind.\n\nSomething that may have gone slightly under the radar towards the end of the game was Alderete’s injury and subsequent replacement by Geertruida. He is our only left-sided centre-half, providing a hugely important balance to our play. We don’t know the extent of the injury so I’m hoping that it was something of a precautionary move to take him off (something we saw with Sadiki at the weekend), but it’s something to keep an eye on over the next few days.",

    "fullText": "A fitting tribute to lifelong supporter George, both on 26 minutes and at half-time. I Couldn’t Get A Ticket For The Game. A lovely sentiment and tribute. Sunderland ‘Til I Die — never a truer word.\n\nA bright star in a mostly mundane performance. His talent shone through when many others were uninspiring.\n\nThe crowd were up for the match, but for most of the first half the lads gave them nothing to shout about. If someone had told me it was a master plan to go 1-0 behind in that opening half — I would have believed them. We stood off and didn’t push, and showed them far too much respect. It was only my belief that RLB always has a plan that stopped me pulling what little hair I have left out! Very frustrating, and we should have been behind at the interval. It was good fortune mixed with some solid blocking which kept us in it.\n\nThere was a peculiar lack of urgency for much of the game, which I couldn’t quite fathom. Even Roefs in goal seemed to take an age to release the ball or kick downfield. His distribution was much quicker at the start of the season. A great season it’s been, and no disgrace to lose to Liverpool, but I wished we’d shown more tonight. Disappointing.\n\nMaking his full debut tonight, Nilson Angulo took a little time to get settled but looked a real threat once he got going in the second half. The young winger looked a box of tricks and I counted three nutmegs from my perfect view in front of him during the second half.\n\nDespite it coming to an end, to have waited until mid-February to leave my first home match after a loss is an outstanding achievement. On another day that header goes wide and we draw 0-0 against the current Champions. To have performed as well as we have at home is nothing short of spectacular and something we’ll look back on in the future as a real special run.\n\nDespite looking like some weeks it works well, when it doesn’t it makes our build-up look clunky and Hume’s positioning is great for a low-block but offers little in transition. With Oxford coming up a change back to traditional wingers might be a welcome breath of fresh air.\n\nWith Alderete our only left-sided central defender, hearts will be in mouths that his injury isn’t too serious; however it might provide him with a much-needed break after a few weeks slightly off the boil. With Geertruida knocking on the door for a place we may see an opportunity for him to cement his name on the team sheet either at right-back or in the centre of defence going forward.\n\nOur new signing showed flashes of his quality throughout. With a sure first touch, an eye for a pass and confident on the ball, Angulo made some skilful, driving runs at the Liverpool defence. An end product was lacking, but plenty of signs of good things to come from our new man.\n\nLiverpool probably deserved their win given the chances they created, but we gave a good account of ourselves against the current English champions. Had we made better decisions in the final third, we would have been worthy of rescuing a point and maintaining our unbeaten home record. That record has now gone, but to lose it in mid-February against Liverpool is a remarkable achievement really.\n\nSome big performances by some but not enough\n\nI thought both Robin Roefs and Dan Ballard were fantastic in keeping Liverpool at bay; both were very commanding in their respective roles. However, a few of our Lads weren’t quite at their best. Trai Hume struggled defensively, Ronaldo showed his petulant side while Alderete’s dip in form continued. Could this be fatigue due to a lack of rotation and the number of games catching up with us?\n\nWe had over 47,000 in the ground on a cold, wet night, but for whatever reason, I felt the atmosphere was a bit quieter than it has been on previously this season. The late kick-off and the weather didn’t help, but I hope the SoL is bouncing again when we take on Fulham in our next home game.",

He was even left out of the latest match day squad for them yesterday, signalling a sign that actually, they don’t even rate him that highly and he will not be staying there beyond the summer.\n\nIt looks like we might finally see defender Mamadou Sarr in action on Friday night since his return to the club in the January window. Sarr is expected to either start or play some minutes in the FA Cup game vs Hull City!",

    "fullText": "Barcelona sporting director Deco has confirmed the club’s plans for Andreas Christensen who is currently out injured and out of contract in the summer.\n\nThere’s also been talk that Joan Laporta is willing to hand the Dane a contract extension for another year, and Deco says the club will make an offer to the defender.\n\n“With some players, such as Andreas, the idea was to follow his trajectory a little this season. He is a player who has given us a lot. In his first year here, with Xavi, he played a lot of games and was key in the league he won. He is a player of a very high level,” he told Sport.\n\n“However, it is true that in recent years he has been very conditioned by injuries. The idea this season was to analyse their situation and, from there, decide how to proceed. The injury is a little ahead of that decision.\n\n“We don’t want to leave the player in a complicated situation, because we believe that he will hardly be able to play between now and the end of the season.\n\n“Therefore, the idea is to offer him something compatible, which we believe is fair. From there, the player is free to make decisions. He is not obliged to stay at Barça, but we are going to try, at least, that he has an offer on the table, that he can evaluate it and then decide what he considers best for his future.”\n\nChristensen has said publicly that he wants to stay at Barcelona and that “he doesn’t have a Plan B” which suggests he’s likely to accept any offer that Barcelona make this summer.",

Now, it's time for the squad to prove how far U.S. hockey has come.\n\nThe journey starts against Latvia, a team that isn't projected to finish high in the tournament. But, the team might be overlooked; with six NHL players on the roster and a potential top-10 pick in the 2026 NHL Draft. Moreover, there is recent history with these teams, with Latvia defeating the U.S. in the 2023 IIHF World Championship third-place game to claim their first ever medal in major men's hockey.\n\nBoth teams have a chance to start something special in Milan on Thursday. For the U.S., it can propel a run to the gold medal, and for Latvia, it would be one of the biggest upsets in history to continue the rise of Latvian hockey.\n\nHere's where you can find the contest on television and streaming.\n\nMORE 2026 OLYMPICS: Live medal tracker | Viewer's guide | Day-by-day schedule\n\nTeam USA's first game against Latvia will be broadcast nationally on USA Network. Those looking to live stream the game can via Peacock, which serves as the streaming home of the Games.\n\nPeacock will carry every event of the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics live. The NBC-owned streaming service's sports programming features live coverage of NFL Sunday Night Football, the NBA, the Olympic and Paralympic Games, Premier League soccer, Big Ten football and basketball, Notre Dame football, Big East and Big 12 basketball, PGA Tour golf, and more.\n\nBoth teams' Olympic campaigns start on Thursday, Feb. 12 at 3:10 p.m.\n\nIt is being held at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena in Milan, Italy, which is the centerpiece for the tournament.\n\nTeam USA enters Group C of the 2026 Winter Olympics as a heavy favorite. All of their preliminary round games follow a consistent schedule for fans in the United States, with puck drop set for 3:10 PM ET.\n\nIf Team USA wins their group or finishes as the top second-place team, they will likely bypass the Qualification Playoff and head straight to the Quarterfinals.",

    "fullText": "A former Hull KR player known as the Cornish Express is backing the Robins in their World Club Challenge match against the Brisbane Broncos.\n\nGraham Paul, 91, played for the club in the late 1950s and early 1960s, including in the Challenge Cup final against Widnes in 1964.\n\nTo celebrate the match against the Broncos on 19 February, the BBC is organising a World Club Relay of fans and VIPs. And while Paul will be watching from his native Cornwall, he was keen to send a good luck message.\n\n\"It's going to be a big game, no doubt about that,\" he said. \"To the boys I would say, stay calm, your game is good, back it. You know your game, stick to your game and you have every chance of winning.\"\n\nPaul described how much the game had changed over the past 70 years.\n\nHe recalled travelling to Hull with his wife to join the club in 1958 after playing rugby union for Cornish sides and the RAF.\n\n\"Rovers signed us and they arranged for us to stay in an apartment over this wet fish shop, which was fine,\" he said.\n\n\"We were there for maybe a couple of months, but the problem was everything we wore smelt of fish and this led to certain family problems.\"\n\nAfter scoring five tries in a match in 1961, he was given the nickname the Cornish Express by the newspapers.\n\nHe bought a house in the city and spent six seasons at Craven Park, playing 197 games and scoring 116 tries, before returning home to Cornwall.\n\nPaul said that he never took his place in the team for granted.\n\n\"The team was selected by the directors, probably given to them by the coach, and that was published in the Hull Daily Mail on Wednesday mornings,\" he said.\n\n\"Every Wednesday morning I bought a Hull Daily Mail to check that I was playing at the weekend.\"\n\nHe still follows the Robins, watching as many games as he can on television, and is very proud of them winning three trophies last season.\n\n\"Hull KR have had a few difficult years,\" he said.\n\n\"They've struggled as a Yorkshire club against the Lancashire clubs. You had the likes of Wigan and St Helens who have dominated the game.\n\n\"And now, almost out of the blue, Hull KR have come bursting through and won everything.\"\n\nAhead of the World Club Challenge match kicking off, BBC Radio Humberside is organising a relay to carry a ball from Hull KR's home at Craven Park across the city to the MKM Stadium, where the match will be played.\n\nListen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.\n\nDownload the BBC News app from the App Store for iPhone and iPad or Google Play for Android devices\n\nFans wanted for World Club Challenge relay\n\nHull KR sell out rival's stadium in record time\n\nWorld Club Challenge returns with Hull KR v Broncos",

    "fullText": "Many of us are keen to forget hours spent running around muddy fields as part of cross country. But, as the National Championships return to north-east England for the first time in more than 10 years, amateur runners are excited to get on that start line - and cannot believe they have overcome the trauma from their school days.\n\nSam Harrison, 34, says cross country used to be the \"worst time of the week\".\n\n\"Once I'd done it at school, I thought 'I'm never doing that again'.\"\n\nHarrison did not fully commit to running until he was about 26 and was forced to give up football following three knee operations.\n\nHis dad had been running since he was 18 and was a member of Saltwell Harriers, in Gateshead, and suggested he joined too so that he would have a new outlet.\n\nLike many others, Harrison stuck to road running before the club floated the prospect of cross country.\n\n\"I had all those memories of it but then when I started hearing everyone's enthusiasm about it at the club, I was like, all right, maybe there's some in this that I missed.\"\n\nThe season runs across the autumn and winter, and clubs in the region compete in the North East Harrier League.\n\nThe fixtures are run in teams of four, which score points based on each runner's finishing position.\n\nBut most people do not take part to win.\n\nKayleigh Pickersgill, 40, has been running for more than 10 years and now serves as ladies' captain at Sunderland Strollers.\n\nShe came to running later in life because she found it was good for her mental health \"just to go out and run\".\n\nWhen she joined the club, she had never done cross country before and the club struggled to get the four women needed to make up a team.\n\n\"Someone just asked me if I would run and I went along and I absolutely loved it,\" Pickersgill says.\n\n\"I just decided I'm going to bang the drum for this, because it's so much fun.\"\n\nPickersgill says the numbers have grown to the point where Sunderland Strollers have fielded five women's teams on occasion, instead of struggling to just form one.\n\nAccording to England Athletics, there has been \"significant growth\" in the number of women competing in the North East cross country league in recent years.\n\nClaire Lloyd, 45, is chair of Saltwell Harriers and also hated cross country at school.\n\nBut after joining the club, she quickly got the bug.\n\n\"It's all about the camaraderie and team spirit,\" she says.\n\nMany clubs celebrate with treats following the races. Harrison jokes the cake is what makes him stick around.\n\nAs a winter sport, it can be wet and freezing. But that also seems to be part of the fun.\n\n\"It's a weird one because I was about to say it's still an enjoyable experience, but for a lot of the time, it's not,\" Lloyd says.\n\n\"It's hard, it's really hard, but you get the satisfaction afterwards from having participated.\"\n\nAccording to Lloyd, harsher conditions also level the playing field.\n\n\"I'm not very keen when it's quite dry,\" she says.\n\n\"The dryer courses just play into the hands of the fast people, whereas when it's really boggy and really heavy underfoot it's a bit of a leveller.\n\n\"It slows the fast ones down and gives the rest of us a bit more of a chance.\n\n\"It's not really cross country if it isn't boggy.\"\n\nThe National Cross Country Championships are being held in Hardwick East Park in Sedgefield on 21 February.\n\nIt is the first time the competition has been held in the North East since 2013 and it has not been in County Durham for 25 years.\n\nChris Lines, 54, runs for Sedgefield Harriers, who are helping to organise the event, and says it is great to give local runners the opportunity to line up with the elites.\n\n\"It's one of those rare occasions in the national event of our sport where you can line up as an equal, for the first few yards anyway, with the best runners in the country,\" he says.\n\n\"Everyone starts in the same place and is equal and that is a real privilege.\"\n\nHarrison, Pickersgill, Lloyd and Lines will be among those on that start line.\n\nHarrison says he took part in his first Nationals last year in London and it \"cemented\" his love for the sport.\n\n\"People were turning up there to try and be the best in the country,\" he says.\n\n\"I thought that was quite cool to get a chance to run with some of the quickest runners in the country.\"\n\nPickersgill says that is what makes Nationals so exciting.\n\n\"You get a right mix of abilities,\" she says.\n\n\"You get elites coming to do it, but then you just get the people who are there for the sheer joy of the fact that it's a team day out and it's in the North East and we're going to run around in the mud.\n\n\"It's like a runner's Christmas.\"\n\nFollow BBC North East on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.\n\nUnloved in PE, ignored at top - what is cross country's future?\n\nRun and a bun - the rise of social running groups\n\nThe 'vibrant' running club 'making a real difference'",

Unfortunately, Cole Palmer blazed over the bar when it seemed impossible to miss. But as Liam Rosenior said, we played well for all but a five-minute spell, and JP was once again a key factor in all that.\n\nWe joked that Liam Rosenior’s arrival would revitalize his fellow Liam, but it’s been João Pedro, who’s enjoyed life most under the new manager.

    "fullText": "Arsenal travel to Brentford on Thursday night, aiming to preserve their six-point lead at the top of the Premier League table.\n\nThe Gunners have moved into February with immense momentum, following four consecutive victories that have solidified their title charge. Manager Mikel Arteta oversaw a dominant 3–0 success over Sunderland last weekend, ending the day nine points clear before Manchester City’s late comeback at Anfield. Arsenal arrive in West London seeking a fourth consecutive clean sheet, a defensive feat they last achieved during a record-breaking streak in late 2024.\n\nMikel Arteta navigates fitness concerns regarding several key creative figures. Notably, a persistent hip injury keeps Bukayo Saka on the sidelines. Furthermore, Martin Ødegaard remains a major doubt after missing the last two matches with a minor muscle issue. Consequently, Kai Havertz likely retains his place in a deeper midfield role. Leandro Trossard adds to the headache; he limped off against Sunderland with a calf injury.\n\nDavid Raya starts in goal. Riccardo Calafiori likely features in the defensive line ahead of him, though Piero Hincapie offers a viable alternative. In midfield, Declan Rice and Martin Zubimendi aim to dictate the tempo. Up front, Viktor Gyökeres returns to the starting lineup. He scored twice off the bench last weekend.

    "fullText": "Carlos Baleba oversaw a ‘nightmare’ first half last night as Brighton and Hove Albion locked horns with Aston Villa in the West Midlands.\n\nAmidst the Seagulls’ desperate plight to find form in the Premier League, the midfielder couldn’t contribute in the way he – or Fabian Hurzeler –  intended ahead of kick-off.\n\n(Photo by Dan Mullan/Getty Images)\n\nBaleba, who was said to be Ruben Amorim’s ‘first-choice’ target last summer, was shown a yellow card inside two minutes at Villa Park.\n\nJust 20 minutes later, Hurzeler decided to withdraw him from the action entirely when he narrowly escaped a second booking, after which the 22-year-old was spotted looking ‘inconsolable’ on the Brighton bench.\n\nThose who’ve kept tabs on Brighton’s affairs during the term will know that Baleba’s performances have faltered considerably in comparison to 2024/2025 – and the Seagulls manager thinks United’s interest has something to do with it.\n\nBack in September, when it was becoming clear that the Cameroonian was struggling to find his feet following an approach from the Red Devils, Hurzeler told reporters: “For sure, when a young boy reads there is interest from Manchester United with a big, big offer, it might affect him deep, deep down.\n\n“That’s also part of the development to understand that when you play well, there comes a big offer, there comes a big club that wants to have him.”\n\n(Photo by Mike Hewitt/Getty Images)\n\nA formal offer was never submitted by United, but Baleba had green-lit the move and made it clear he wanted to make the switch to Old Trafford.\n\nHowever, after Brighton outlined their stance that he wasn’t for sale, he honoured their requests and didn’t go as far as forcing a transfer.\n\nBaleba is now among a host of Premier League stars being monitored by INEOS chiefs in the lead-up to the summer window, with Adam Wharton, Elliot Anderson and Sandro Tonali all greatly admired in M16.\n\nINEOS will be taking note as ‘first-choice’ PL target left ‘inconsolable’ after ‘nightmare’ display\n\nTwo Man Utd stars left sweating for their place in Starting XI after Carrick’s ‘unbelievable’ comment\n\nSky Sports share fresh Michael Carrick update out of Man Utd on Weds afternoon that’ll surprise supporters",

    "fullText": "Olympic skier Tess Johnson, 25, says she never travels to competitions without her journal.\n\nThe American mogul skier journals twice daily — and also carves out time to write before her races.\n\nShe says journaling gets her in the right headspace and helps her stay present and off her phone.\n\nOlympic skier Tess Johnson, 25, starts and ends every day with the same ritual that helps her perform under pressure.\n\nIn an interview with Town & Country Magazine published on Wednesday, the American mogul skier said she always packs her journal when she travels for competitions.\n\n\"I do a little bit of journaling in the morning to set my day, set my goals for the day and a little bit of gratitude, but then in the evening I let it all out and it's a little bit like word vomit, but whatever I need to just get out to get a good night of sleep,\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson made the US national team at 14 — the youngest athlete to do so at the time — and later became the youngest American freestyle skier to medal at the World Championships.\n\nShe debuted at the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics and reached the finals at the 2026 Milan Cortina Games, where she finished 10th.\n\nJohnson, whose grandfather was a former Sports Illustrated writer who covered the Olympics, said journaling plays a key role in her mental preparation.\n\nShe believes she inherited her love of writing from her grandfather and now uses journaling as a practical training tool to track her progress in skiing.\n\n\"And also an emotional tool to just work through whatever anxieties are happening because this is a very intense sport and process that we're going through,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"It's really helpful to get it all out on paper and sift through it just by putting pen to paper. So it does a lot for me. And at the very least, it's just a way to stay present and get off my phone from time to time,\" she continued.\n\nJohnson added that she occasionally rereads her old journals, including those from the 2018 Olympics.\n\n\"It's really cool to see the progress I've made over the years,\" she said.\n\nApart from being a part of her daily routine, journaling is also a key part of her pre-race ritual.\n\n\"The night before I like to journal, whatever in training that day, any other thoughts that I need to get out. Then the morning of, I'll write down three goals for the day, usually relating to my skiing or a mental performance goal, or just something even maybe not related to skiing, just that I have for the day, and then I'll write down a couple things that I'm grateful for as well,\" Johnson said, adding that she does her warm ups after that.\n\nJohnson isn't the only elite athlete who has embraced journaling as part of their routine.\n\nMichael Phelps told Business Insider in 2023 that he uses writing to reflect and unwind, while WNBA star Caitlin Clark has incorporated journaling into her pregame ritual to clear her head and stay focused.\n\nMeanwhile, other Olympians are leaning into surprisingly old-school hobbies in their downtime, including cross-country skier Ben Ogden, who said knitting helps him relax.",

    "fullText": "Premier League leaders Arsenal travel to the Gtech Community Stadium on Thursday night, aiming to banish a peculiar midweek curse and maintain their six-point advantage at the top of the table.\n\nThe Gunners arrive in West London having “banished their January blues,” recording four consecutive wins across all competitions, including a clinical 3–0 victory over Sunderland on Saturday. However, Mikel Arteta’s side faces a historical hurdle: despite an impressive overall midweek record, Arsenal have failed to win—or even score—in any of their last three Premier League games played specifically on a Thursday. Standing in their way is a high-flying Brentford side that has emerged as the season’s “surprise package”. Under Keith Andrews, the seventh-placed Bees have won their last two matches, including a dramatic 3–2 triumph at St James’ Park last weekend.\n\nDate: Thursday, 12 February 2026\n\nVenue: Gtech Community Stadium, London\n\nLast Meeting: Arsenal 2–0 Brentford (2 Dec 2025), Premier League\n\nKeith Andrews remains without Kevin Schade, who serves the second of a three-match suspension for violent conduct. Reiss Nelson is ineligible to face his parent club, while long-term absentees Fabio Carvalho, Antoni Milambo, and Josh Dasilva continue their recoveries. After a strong showing in Newcastle, the Bees are expected to remain largely unchanged, though Yehor Yarmolyuk is pushing for a start in midfield.\n\nMikel Arteta faces several late fitness calls. Bukayo Saka (hip) and Martin Ødegaard (muscle) both missed the Sunderland win and remain doubtful for the derby. Leandro Trossard is also a major doubt after sustaining a calf issue late against the Black Cats. However, Viktor Gyökeres is poised for a recall to the starting XI after his decisive brace off the bench last weekend.\n\nThe Gunners have maintained a high level of performance in local fixtures. Notably, Arsenal have lost just one of their last 23 Premier League London derbies (W17 D5). Defensively, they arrive in peak condition, having kept three consecutive clean sheets in all competitions heading into Thursday’s clash. However, the “Thursday curse” remains a concern, as the team has failed to score in their last three league outings on this specific day.\n\nThe Bees have turned their home ground into a nightmare for visitors. Notably, Igor Thiago has been in sensational form, netting nine goals in his last 10 home matches—a tally bettered only by Erling Haaland this season. Brentford also boast a clinical edge, with an xG per shot of 0.16, the best by any Premier League team in the last five seasons. While they are winless in eight against the Gunners, their current form suggests they are more than capable of an upset.\n\nBrentford Predicted XI: Kelleher; Kayode, Van den Berg, Ajer, Henry; Janelt, Henderson; Ouattara, Jensen, Lewis-Potter; Thiago\n\nArsenal Predicted XI: Raya; Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori; Havertz, Zubimendi, Rice; Madueke, Gyokeres, Martinelli\n\nThe match will be televised live in the UK on TNT Sports 1, with coverage starting at 19:00 GMT ahead of the 20:00 kick-off.

    "description": "It didn’t take new Jazz player Jaren Jackson Jr. much time to get used to his new digs at the Delta Center.",
    "fullText": "It didn’t take new Jazz player Jaren Jackson Jr. much time to get used to his new digs at the Delta Center.\n\nIn front of a sellout crowd of 18,186 in his first home game as a Jazzman, Jackson Jr. provided Utah fans with a glimpse of what this team could be next season in a 121-93 win over a depleted Sacramento Kings team.\n\nWith just one game left until the all-star break and just 27 to go in the season, the Jazz are seeing the light at the end of the tanking tunnel.\n\n“Yeah, it’s a high ceiling. Tonight we didn’t have our full group out there, obviously, and just getting Keyonte and Walker back. Really excited what we can do with this group,” said Jazz forward Lauri Markkanen.\n\n“I think we can do a lot of different things, different coverage on defense and then run the offense differently depending on who’s got it going and what the matchups be. And I think having this group of guys and obviously Will (Hardy) leading us, he’s kind of picking his brain to getting us what’s working on different nights. And so I’m really excited.”\n\nJackson Jr. scored a game-high 23 points on 61.5% shooting and added four rebounds, two assists, a steal and a block in his home debut.\n\n“He’s a very efficient offensive player. He can do it both inside and out. I told Jaren that I think the thing that I’ve appreciated the most about him offensively is how he uses the 3-point line. I think he has a good ratio right now. He’s not just launching 3s. I think he’s a capable shooter, but his physicality and his touch around the basket’s really good,” said Jazz coach Will Hardy.\n\nMarkkanen and Brice Sensabaugh scored 19 points apiece and rookie Ace Bailey pitched in 13 in the Jazz’s dominant win.\n\n“I thought the team was really focused for the most part, start to finish, did a good job protecting the paint again. It’s been a theme lately and it’s allowed us to play in transition a little bit more than we have been, which has been good for us. And then I think the group is doing a really good job of playing off of each other,” Hardy said.\n\nThe Jazz won their second game in a row, starting star players Jackson Jr. and Markkanen against a depleted Sacramento Kings team without Russell Westbrook, Zach Lavine, Malik Monk, Domantas Sabonis, Keegan Murray and De’Andre Hunter.\n\nThe Jazz were only missing Keyonte George and, of course, Walker Kessler from the lineup on Wednesday night.\n\nUtah’s starting lineup was simply too much for the hapless Kings, and as a result, the Jazz raced out to a 39-20 lead over the visitors behind 12 points from Jackson Jr., nine points from Markkanen and eight points from Sensabaugh in the first quarter\n\nThe Jazz shot 55% from the field, including 50% from 3, in the first period of play while limiting the Kings to 36.8% shooting.\n\nAfter outscoring the Kings 32-24 in the second quarter to lead 71-44 at the half, the Jazz were able to coast to an easy win.\n\nThe Kings (12-44) continued their hold on the worst record in the NBA as BYU star AJ Dybantsa, who should be selected within the first three picks of the 2026 NBA draft, watched what could be one of his future teams from courtside seats at the Delta Center.\n\nWednesday was Jackson Jr.’s third game with his new team, but in some ways, it felt like his first with the Jazz. It was the former Grizzlies forward’s first time in front of his new home crowd, his first time in the Utah locker room and his first time running out of the home tunnel.\n\n“This kind of felt like my first game in a weird way,” he said.\n\nJackson Jr. got a loud ovation from the crowd when he was introduced and any time he scored, and received walk-off interview honors following the performance as the crowd showed him their appreciation.\n\n“I was kind of just enjoying the moment. … And I just wanted to enjoy it. It helped that we were winning. It helps me enjoy the game more. So credit to everybody getting me this win here. But yeah, it was dope. Great experience,” Jackson Jr. said.\n\nAside from his offensive play, Jackson Jr. was brought to Salt Lake City to raise the team’s defensive profile. The Jazz have owned the worst defense in the NBA this season — partly due to roster design — and the addition of the 2022-23 Defensive Player of the Year instantly improves that side of the ball.\n\nIt came against a Kings team missing pretty much all of its meaningful players, but Wednesday night’s win was the first time this season that the Jazz have held an opponent under 100 points.\n\n“Just being active. I think talking for sure when I’m behind the guards in the back line, letting them know where I’m at, let them know what they should do,” Jackson Jr. said. “They have a lot of new schemes here that I think we could take advantage of because of our size. Personnel helps us get a lot of things done, but you got to have that intensity too. So I think we’ve already been better, so that’s good.”\n\nThe Jazz sent out a supersized starting lineup of Jackson (6-10), Markkanen (7-1), Jusuf Nurkic (6-11), Ace Bailey (6-9) and Isaiah Collier (6-4). The Kings had no answer for the Jazz’s size, and Utah outscored Sacramento 58-42 in the paint.\n\n“His size. He can protect the paint. He can guard the perimeter. And then obviously on the offensive end, he’s a tough matchup with anybody,” Markkanen said of Jackson Jr. “With all three of us out there, we have a big lineup and someone’s going to have a small (matchup) at times and he’s one of the best ones to punish this matchup for sure.”\n\nAside from his contributions on the court, Jackson Jr. has quickly acclimated himself to the locker room, and Hardy is just as excited for his off-the-court impact.\n\n“When we traded for Jaren, obviously there’s so much talk about the player and I’m very excited about the player, but what we’re trying to build as an organization and a program, Jaren’s character and who he is as a person is just as important, and I think that that has been really evident from the day that he got here,” Hardy said.\n\n“He’s a high character guy. He’s got a good sense of humor. He also has a respect level that comes with him because of how he’s played during his career. So I think that from a human standpoint, he’s meshing with the group really well. We haven’t talked about that as much as the player piece, but what I’ve seen from him and Vince (Williams Jr.) and John (Konchar) is that all three are really, really high character guys and we’re lucky to have them in our organization.”",

    "fullText": "Brentford host Arsenal at the Gtech Community Stadium on Thursday night, seeking to maintain their surprise push for European football.\n\nThe Bees have moved into seventh place following a string of clinical performances under manager Keith Andrews. Brentford arrive in this London derby with high confidence after securing back-to-back wins over Aston Villa and Newcastle United. Notably, the home side has outperformed expectations this season, already completing a league double over Newcastle. A victory tonight would break a long winless run against the Gunners and significantly boost their hopes of a top-six finish.\n\nKeith Andrews manages a squad significantly thinned in the attacking areas. Notably, Kevin Schade is unavailable as he serves the second of a three-game ban for a straight red card received against Aston Villa. Consequently, Dango Ouattara is expected to keep his place after his match-winning heroics at St James’ Park. The Bees are also without Reiss Nelson, who is ineligible to play against his parent club.\n\nCaoimhín Kelleher will start in goal behind a defensive unit likely featuring Nathan Collins and Sepp van den Berg. Keane Lewis-Potter has impressed in a versatile role on the left, while Vitaly Janelt and Mathias Jensen anchor the midfield. Igor Thiago spearheads the attack as the league’s second-highest scorer with 17 goals. Notably, Brentford boast the joint-best defence in the league over the last eight matchdays, conceding just seven goals.\n\nBrentford predicted XI: Kelleher; Kayode, Van den Berg, Ajer, Henry; Janelt, Henderson; Ouattara, Jensen, Lewis-Potter; Thiago\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at the Gtech Community Stadium on Thursday, 12 February 2026. Kick-off is scheduled for 20:00 GMT.\n\nLive television coverage will be available in the UK on TNT Sports 1.

    "fullText": "If you build it, they will come?\n\nSome Iowa state senators introduced a bill this week that would expand the state's major economic growth attraction program, creating financial incentives that could lure an NFL team seeking to build a stadium in the Hawkeye State.\n\nTheir target? The Chicago Bears.\n\n\"After years of Bears fans seeking refuge across the Mississippi River from the incompetence, corruption and punitive tax and regulatory climate in the state of Illinois, it is time for the team to join their fans on the west side of the river,\" Republican Scott Webster, one of the legislation's sponsors said in a statement.\n\n\"Iowa can offer the Bears everything they need to build a world-class facility, tax certainty and the public infrastructure they need in a state led by common-sense conservatives.\"\n\nThe recruitment pitch didn't end there.\n\n\"While Illinois and Indiana squabble over this issue, we are ready to get off the sidelines and into the game,\" Kerry Gruenhagen, another senator sponsoring the bill, said in a statement. \"Bringing an NFL team to Iowa would attract jobs, tourism and fans to our state and give us the opportunity to showcase what Iowa really has to offer. Iowans have dedicated themselves to our college sports teams, and we're ready to attract a professional team to our great state.\"\n\nWhile Iowa was the stage for \"Field of Dreams,\" it isn't home to any major professional sports franchises.\n\nOne of the NFL's original franchises, born in 1920 as the Decatur Staleys, the Bears have been seeking a new stadium for years. Tenants of historic Soldier Field, the league's smallest venue in terms of capacity (61,500) in downtown Chicago since 1971, the Bears had planned to move to suburban Arlington Heights, where they own a 326-acre tract of land that used to be the site of Arlington International Racecourse.\n\nBut team president Kevin Warren wrote in a letter to season ticket-holders in December that an inability to get assistance from the state of Illinois in offsetting infrastructure costs around the proposed project had led the team to consider alternatives. The team has committed to paying for construction of a new stadium itself.\n\n\"We have not asked for state taxpayer dollars to build the stadium at Arlington Park. We asked only for a commitment to essential local infrastructure (roads, utilities, and site improvements) which is more than typical for projects of this size,\" Warren wrote. \"Additionally, we sought reasonable property tax certainty to secure financing. We listened to state leadership and relied on their direction and guidance, yet our efforts have been met with no legislative partnership.\n\n\"We have been told directly by State leadership, our project will not be a priority in 2026.\"\n\nWarren specifically cited Northwest Indiana as a potential locale to build a new stadium.\n\nHowever, Illinois officials continue working to find a solution that would keep the Bears, a beloved team and one on the rise after winning the NFC North for the first time since 2018, in the Chicagoland area, where they've played since 1921.\n\n\"There’s a lot of discussion, a lot of ongoing conversation with the Bears, and indeed, frankly, progress that’s been made. So I’m pleased about that,\" Gov. JB Pritzker said Monday.\n\n\"But I’m going to let the Bears talk about what it is that they want to get done and how they want to get it done. And I’m obviously involved in negotiations and so are my entire team, as well as the members of the Legislature.\"\n\nAll NFL news on and off the field. \n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Chicago Bears to Iowa?

    "description": "Rare but dangerous blood clotting associated with that vaccine as well as AstraZeneca’s had a genetic cause, according to a new paper.",
    "fullText": "In 2021, just months after the first COVID vaccines debuted, concern was growing about an exceedingly rare but sometimes deadly outcome of certain shots. Two related vaccines—one from AstraZeneca and the other from Johnson & Johnson—were linked to dangerous blood clotting.\n\nOut of almost 19 million doses of Johnson & Johnson’s version given in the United States during the first two years of the pandemic, at least 60 such cases were identified. Nine of them were fatal. In the United Kingdom, where almost 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca shot were given, 455 cases occurred; 81 people died. In Germany, at least 71 cases were identified, also linked to AstraZeneca. By late spring, use of both the AstraZeneca and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was paused, and ultimately both were pulled from the market. But the mystery surrounding the rare blood clotting caused by these vaccines lingered.\n\nNow researchers believe they have cracked the case. They have hard evidence for how the blood clotting happened, and they believe that their findings could help make similar vaccines even safer. Understanding the blood-clotting problem is important, they say, because vaccines of this type could be essential in protecting people during future pandemics.\n\nThe team that initially gave this condition a name—vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, or VITT—included Andreas Greinacher, a blood expert at the University of Greifswald, in Germany. Back in 2021, as the cases of VITT emerged, he and others were unsure of what precipitated them. One theory was that they were caused by the body’s accidental reaction to the type of virus used in both the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines: adenoviruses, which had been engineered to prompt the body to recognize the pandemic coronavirus but were unable to replicate and considered harmless to people. Scientists had noticed that patients with VITT had telltale markers in their blood—antibodies that bind to a chemical signal released by platelets. Maybe a reaction to the adenovirus was causing immune cells to mistakenly go after a blood component and precipitate clotting. An alternative theory was that the body was reacting to a portion of the coronavirus called “spike protein,” which showed up as part of the immunization.\n\nIn a study published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, Greinacher and his colleagues show that the first theory was correct: VITT was a response to the adenovirus gone awry. And they discovered a further twist: This immune overreaction happened in people who were genetically prone to it.\n\nIn the study, Greinacher and his colleagues looked at the antibodies in stored blood from 21 patients with VITT. Among those antibodies, they found a subset that could glom on to a portion of the adenovirus and to one of the body’s own molecules, PF4, that can influence blood clotting. A person who received one of the adenovirus vaccines but did not have a reaction also had antibodies against that same part of the adenovirus. But, crucially, that person’s antibodies did not cross-react with PF4.\n\nThose antibody molecules also offered clues about the immune cells that made them. And the scientists were able to link the immune cells responsible for VITT to patients who had two specific DNA variants. A wider survey of 100 VITT patients found that all of them had immune cells with one of these genetic types—which are far from universal. This signaled to the researchers that having these particular variants is a strong risk factor for blood clotting following an adenovirus vaccine.\n\nBut the study also showed that this genetic background on its own was not enough to cause VITT. The immune cells that made the dangerous antibodies had experienced an additional small genetic change, and that extra mutation had prompted them to produce those cross-reactive molecules.\n\nIn the past, scientists have suggested that genetic predispositions might explain some adverse events that happen after vaccination. For example, some data have indicated that certain people were genetically prone to developing narcolepsy following a version of swine-flu vaccine that was briefly used in Europe. But the new study from Greinacher and his team is the first to provide concrete evidence of how people with a particular DNA variant can develop self-sabotaging antibodies following a vaccination. Arnold Lining Ju, a biomedical engineer at the University of Sydney who has studied blood clotting, told me that the paper was a landmark finding in part because of how elegantly it explains the way a specific genetic trait, combined with a particular chance mutation in certain cells, creates VITT. And because the study shows that multiple genetic changes are involved, it finally explains why this immune reaction is so rare, he said.\n\nThis discovery will help guide researchers more than it will influence vaccination choices for individual patients. Most vaccine recipients will not know their genetic predisposition to an adverse event, Jennifer Juno, a vaccine researcher at the University of Melbourne, points out. But this type of work will help improve vaccine design—particularly in the field of “precision vaccinology,” in which vaccines are tailored to individual traits, Joanne Reed, the director of the Centre for Immunology and Allergy Research at the Westmead Institute in Australia, told me.\n\nThese results also mean that adenovirus-based vaccines could be made safer if they can be designed without the protein region that triggered the dangerous antibodies in VITT. “Instead of abandoning an entire vaccine platform because of a rare problem, we can engineer around the specific issue, and that’s the power of this kind of science,” Joann Arce of the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children’s Hospital told me. The hope is that understanding the biology of a rare event like VITT, and then addressing it, helps bolster public trust in vaccines too. Greinacher told me that adenovirus-based vaccines remain vital, including for the development of vaccines for diseases that affect mostly low- and middle-income countries. The shots could also be useful in a future pandemic, because they can be scaled up in production relatively quickly.\n\nStill, this one study may not have entirely answered the question of why adenovirus-based COVID vaccines caused clotting. A study published last year from Ju’s group suggested that a separate biophysical mechanism might cause a viral component found in the AstraZeneca vaccine to directly aggregate platelets, independent of the immune reaction identified in VITT. And a bigger mystery remains open too—why infections themselves are sometimes associated with dangerous blood clotting. Rushad Pavri, an immunologist at King’s College London, told me that the new study—because it shows how similarities between a virus particle and an innate protein involved in clotting can confuse the immune system—can shed light on that question. Ultimately, understanding why viruses can provoke immune overreactions might help limit damaging complications from sickness to begin with.",

Universal phone service was on its way to being the accepted norm by the early 1900s. During this early period, telephone use was increasing, but so was that of the telegraph system, as the economy grew. Heavy commercial users depended on the information it carried, especially so in financial markets, railroads, newspapers, and the government. The original Wall Street ticker tape was a specialized form of telegraph. (The telegraph system, incidentally,  replaced the Pony Express, which took ten days to deliver messages from St. Joseph, Missouri to California.)\n\nThe telephone and telegraph, two competing technologies,  thrived side by side into the early part of the twentieth century,  although the growth in transcontinental phone service began around 1920 to eclipse the demand for telegraphy. The dominant telegraph provider Western Union, founded in 1851, lost ground in the post World War Two years and finalized its demise in the 1980s via unfortunate corporate restructurings and the addition of significant debt. However, the name itself still carried so much prestige and value that it remained in use until 2006 in the money transfer business.  These two competing communications technologies, telephony and telegraphy, existed and operated profitably side by side for decades, although one was gradually lapsing into technological irrelevance.\n\nRenewables, in our view, are the new dominant power-generating technology, analogous to telephones and fossil fuels will gradually fade thing like telegraph.\n\nRenewables will absolutely crush fossil fuels, over the long term, in electric generation because:\n\n1) Renewables will show a lower lifetime cost of operation (no fuel costs). This will be the game changer. (Okay, this is not so evident now. The projected all- in costs of renewables- with storage -and those of low -cost -fossil- fuel generation are close.  But fossil -fuel generation cost  is vulnerable to increases from fuel cost inflation, pollution controls, and environmental lawsuits that should be factored into any realistic long term scenario.) So, consider two power-generating sources, producing the same commodity,  only one of which, fossil fuels, has enormous lifetime (and probably increasing) fuel costs. The other technology has high initial build costs (we call these capital costs) and then produces electricity essentially for free, meaning it has relatively low operating expenses. We don’t think it’s a unique insight to call this an insurmountable competitive advantage. This is the whole game from an economic perspective right here. Everything else after this, as the sage said, is just commentary.\n\n2) Renewables can be deployed more rapidly: two-year new build time versus 5-6 for new gas-fired power generation and 10+ years for new nuclear power stations. Time is money, and the cost of capital tied up for years in a project gets passed on to consumers.\n\n3) Proliferation of batteries increases renewables penetration and begins to address the principal criticism against them, the intermittency of power production. Batteries provide storage capability, enhancing or offsetting the generating limitations of renewables. And in places like California, they are displacing natural gas-fired power generation as well.\n\n4) Demand side management (DSM) techniques are also improving for shifting electrical load and this only helps this transition. One benefit of large commercial electricity customers in a utility’s service area is that they are or can be extremely price sensitive and, as sophisticated customers, can be willing participants in DSM programs with the right incentives.\n\n5) Renewables produce less pollution and environmental degradation. Climate change concerns, however, in our view, have less to do with the emerging dominance of renewables than people realize. In contemporary slang, one might say “It’s all about the Benjamin’s, baby.”\n\nBut there is a further analogy between wholesale electricity power production and the transition from the telegraph to the telephone. The essence of the telegraph was short correspondence and data. Today we call those emails and faxes. We still communicate in a fairly similar fashion, but via a completely different conveyance system that’s digital and fiber optic. Similarly, the photo camera industry is mostly a relic, but people still love taking and sharing pictures, just now it’s with their phones. We don’t think electricity is any different in this respect. Electricity consumers of all types simply want affordable and reliable power, and they don’t care all that much about how it's made. Renewables, for the reasons cited, will produce electricity more cheaply (and more reliably) than fossil-fired competitors. For that reason, they will continue to take market share and increasingly displace fossil-fired generation in all power markets where they compete.\n\nIn the electricity business, fossil-fired power generation, to remain dominant,  needs superior technology and the ability to undercut competitors on price. Our fossil fuel industry today possesses neither. Its costs will rise more or less at the rate of inflation not counting the increasing volatility of natural gas markets. Renewables, on the other hand, are a technology where costs are declining with new scientific advances in things like battery materials and solar panel efficiency. To us, this type of economic competition is like a war in which only one party emerges victorious. The fossil fuel industry may have already lost.\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",

    "fullText": "I’ve been hoping to write a GUI for my Emacs clone for a while now. And I’m putting together a list of Emacs’ display features to keep compatible with when designing the GUI. Unsurprisingly, this list just keeps growing, and, nah,\n\nWaiting to feel ready to do the thing is not doing the thing. 1\n\nSo, I really need to start writing the shittiest Emacs GUI ever.\n\nOf course, writing a blog post to announce “I will write a shitty GUI” is not doing the thing. But at least I get to partly explain “why Emacs redisplay is hard”, as is mentioned in a previous blog post.\n\nSince I do aim to be as compatible with GNU Emacs as possible, we will need to look into how Emacs does rendering, or, in other words, some of the largest C source files in Emacs:\n\nAccording to comments in these files, the 1.2 MB, 38k-line xdisp.c handles “display generation”, xterm.c provides “X window system support”, with “subroutines comprising the redisplay interface, setting up scroll bars and widgets, and handling input”, and sfnt.c is for TrueType format font support. So, indeed a huge part of Emacs’ C core goes to redisplay handling, and even trying to grasp a deeper understanding of it can take significant effort.\n\nFortunately, Emacs contributors have gifted us ample comments for us to gain a bird’s-eye view of Emacs’ rendering internals, like this architecure diagram:\n\nFollowing the comments, we will then come across the central data structure in Emacs redisplay: glyph matrices, defined in dispextern.h. The authors have made it flexible enough to support three text rendering/layout scenarios: Emacs GUI windows, Emacs TUI frames, and Emacs buffer windows nested in TUI frames:\n\nEach glyph matrix contains a bunch of glyph rows, whose contents are filled by display_line, which accepts a glyph iterator and repeatedly push the iterator forward, filling out glyph slot one by one.\n\nIt still sounds quite simple… until it doesn’t.\n\nIt turns out that “pushing the glyph iterator forward” in display_line is just not as simple as it seems: not all texts are read from left to right, and the glyph iterator does not always move one character at a time. Here is an example:\n\nNotice how \"star\" is rendered as s t a r (of course), but כוכב is rendered in a different order? The first Unicode character s[0] is כ, which is rendered at the rightmost column, while the second Unicode character s[1] (ו) is rendered as the third column counting from the left.\n\nThis is because the כוכב text is in Hebrew, which should be read from right to left. And when we mix English and Hebrew texts in the same line, any competent Unicode rendering engine will make sure that the Hebrew text is rendered from right to left. And that means, for right-to-left texts, our glyph iterator will need to jump until the end of that segment and iterate backwards.\n\nI would describe this as a solved problem: Unicode has a well-defined algorithm for rendering bidirectional texts. However, Emacs’ bidi.c is around 120 kB, or around 4k lines, which still doesn’t include the code to pack and unpack a whole Unicode database. I guess that gives a good idea of how much work it might take to support bidirectional text in Emacs, if you don’t use an external library.\n\nFor some other languages, BIDI rendering is not enough. Their characters might “compose” into more complex glyphs, or, “ligatures”. For example, the following Arabic texts 2 must be rendered together as a single glyph to be readable for Arabic speakers:\n\nSupporting ligatures is not a simple matter. It has to know about the font(s) used, and thus needs to handle platform-specific font databases, support font fallback, etc., and have decent performance. The industry standard for this is the HarfBuzz library, and there is a reason that its home page references the xkcd “Dependency” meme:\n\nEmacs also makes use of HarfBuzz, and does support ligatures. It’s only that, Emacs being Emacs, it allows you to customize the whole process, with Lisp code.\n\nTaken from the famous Text Rendering Hates You post. If you haven’t read it, please please go and read it.\n\nEmacs supports ligatures through its character compositions. When iterating through a glyph iterator, it calls composition_reseat_it to produce the corresponding composed glyphs (if any), and then walk the iterator into those glyphs. But, instead of directly delegating to HarfBuzz, Emacs checks composition-function-table first, where the user might put a regexp precondition and then any Lisp code to compose glyphs as they wish.\n\nFor some (or many?), this can be annoying since the default precondition regexps exclude most ligature combinations in programming fonts. For example, - > will not compose into something like → even if you use a font like Fira Code. To support that, you will need to configure the composition-function-table manually, or use ligature.el.\n\nThe above is only about text layout - what glyphs to use on screen, and where to place them. But, like any text rendering engine, of course Emacs allows you to style your text, with something called text properties. For example, by setting a proper face property for a text span, one can customize its font, size, colors, and text decorations. Also, there are some more self-explanatory properties, like invisible, line-height, line-prefix, or display-line-numbers-disable.\n\nBasically, it’s just CSS for text, except that Emacs has made some parts of it … nearly Turing complete?\n\nSo, there is another text property called display, which can contain display properties. For example, with a string display property, the text span will be replaced by that string. For another, by setting a height display property, one can control the height of the texts:\n\nAnd, by setting that height display property to a symbol…\n\n… one can control the height of the texts dynamically, as the Emacs redisplay routine will now call the function pointed by that symbol for a height value.\n\nglyphless-char-display: For glyphless chars, one can display them by hex code, tofu boxes, etc.:\n\nDisplay tables like buffer-display-table: This allows you to override the display of characters in a buffer by replacing them with a string in the table.\n\ncomposition: Another special text property. One may use this to overlap glyphs together. This is purely visual and only works under GUI Emacs.\n\nI am quite sure that anyone reading this blog post can find some unexpected features of GNU Emacs’ redisplay. I’m not saying that those features are “problematic”, but during Emacs’ decades of evolution, people’s expectations certainly have changed.\n\nIt used to be fine to mix up computation and rendering when multi-threading wasn’t a thing; and now, everybody expects some concurrent rendering to make use of all those CPU cores. Terminals used to have quite limited support for characters, and display tables were helpful for converting undisplayable characters into something readable; but now, everything speaks Unicode, and display tables suddenly make little sense. Editors used to be all about texts; and now even terminals get to display images.\n\nSo, if you, people from modern times, are looking to copy Emacs’ redisplay behavior, things are going to be quite tricky. Concurrent display? What about those Turing complete text properties? They need to be run on the main thread. What about composition-function-table which also require running Lisp code?\n\nIt’s time to make some choices.\n\nFirst off, Juicemacs aims to be an exploratory Emacs clone. And for its GUI, I want to go to the extreme: it’s going to build on RPC/IPC protocols and push as much of the work to the client as possible. So, a shitty, minimally functional implementation will need:\n\nThanks for reading! If you have any feedback, any thoughts on a GUI design or some more unexpected Emacs features that I’ve overlooked, please let me know!\n\nThis blog post is also a submission to this month’s Emacs Carnival, theming “This year, I’ll …”. Check it out for more Emacsers’ Emacs plans!",

    "fullText": "An independent forensic report is challenging the 1994 suicide ruling in Kurt Cobain’s death and urging Seattle authorities to review the case, citing contested evidence. The review, by forensic specialist Brian Burnett and researcher Michelle Wilkins, examines the Kurt Cobain death using autopsy details and scene analysis reported via The Daily Mail. It questions whether Cobain could have fired the weapon, citing organ findings some say align with a heroin overdose, and evaluates blood patterns, hand placement, and paraphernalia. The King County Medical Examiner’s Office states it has seen nothing warranting a reopening, and the Seattle Police Department has declined past requests. The report seeks transparency, not arrests; Cobain’s death remains officially classified as a suicide.",

    "description": "President Trump says nearly all governors are welcome at the White House for a formal meeting and dinner next week, though the Democratic governors of Maryland and Colorado are still being excluded.",
    "fullText": "President Trump said Wednesday that nearly all governors are welcome at the White House for a formal meeting and dinner next week, though the Democratic governors of Maryland and Colorado are still being excluded.\n\nThe White House was initially going to exclude Democratic governors from a formal, typically bipartisan business meeting on Feb. 20 during the annual National Governors Association (NGA) conference, according to the NGA and a source familiar with the White House's planning.\n\nAnd two Democratic governors, Wes Moore of Maryland and Jared Polis of Colorado, said they were informed by the NGA last Friday they would not be invited to a separate dinner at the White House on Feb. 21 with the president, the governors and their spouses.\n\nBut after talks between the White House and Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican who chairs the NGA, the organization and the president said Wednesday that governors from both parties are welcome to both the meeting and the dinner. Democratic governors began receiving invitations on Wednesday evening to the business meeting, though the NGA did not receive updates about the White House dinner.\n\nGov. Stitt informed governors of all 55 states and territories on Wednesday that all are invited to the formal meeting on Feb. 20.\n\n\"He was very clear in his communications with me that this is a National Governors Association's event, and he looks forward to hosting you and hearing from governors across the country. President Trump said this was always his intention, and we have addressed the misunderstanding in scheduling,\" Stitt wrote in a message to governors obtained by CBS News.\n\nIn a Wednesday afternoon Truth Social post after Stitt's message was sent, Mr. Trump wrote that Moore and Polis are still excluded. He suggested there was a misunderstanding between him and Stitt.\n\n\"The invitations were sent to ALL Governors, other than two, who I feel are not worthy of being there,\" Trump wrote, adding that he \"even invited\" two of his political foes, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and California Gov. Gavin Newsom. \"So, as usual with him, Stitt got it WRONG! The Invitations were sent out to all other Governors, Democrat and Republican.\"\n\nMoore still received an invite on Wednesday to the formal meeting, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nIt is unclear if Polis received an invitation to that meeting as well. A spokesperson for the Colorado governor said \"no matter what events Colorado is or isn't invited to, Governor Polis will continue to focus on working with his fellow governors and anyone who wants to help make people's lives better.\" CBS News has reached out to the White House.\n\nThe NGA said it was informed by the White House on Feb. 5 that only Republican governors would be invited to the formal business meeting. Because of these exclusions, the NGA said the following day that it would not facilitate that meeting or put it on the group's official schedule. Stitt reiterated that in a letter to governors on Monday, and defended Moore as \"an exceptional vice chair\" for the NGA.\n\nAfter reports of Democratic governors being excluded from the meeting, nearly every Democratic governor put out a joint statement Tuesday that indicated they wouldn't attend any White House events, including the dinner, out of solidarity with Moore and Polis.\n\nIn his Wednesday post, Mr. Trump cited a disagreement over the imprisonment of former Colorado county election clerk Tina Peters as the reason for not inviting Polis. The president has pushed Polis for months to grant clemency to Peters, who is serving a nine-year sentence on multiple state charges related to unauthorized access to voting machines.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump called Moore \"foul mouthed\" and claimed he had embellished receiving military medals, though Moore has said it was an \"honest mistake\" on a White House fellowship application in 2006. He has since received a Bronze Star for his deployment to Afghanistan.\n\nThe president also criticized Stitt, calling him a \"RINO,\" or Republican in name only. Stitt had backed Mr. Trump's former opponent, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, during the 2024 Republican presidential primaries.\n\nMoore called the decision not to invite him \"another example of blatant disrespect and a snub to the spirit of bipartisan federal-state partnership\" in a statement earlier this week.\n\nA Polis spokesperson called it a \"disappointing decision for a traditionally bipartisan event between Governors and whomever occupies the White House.\"\n\nGovernors from both parties attended a White House meeting and dinner during last year's conference. The meeting drew attention for a verbal scuffle between Mr. Trump and Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, in which the president pressed Mills on the issue of transgender women in sports, and Mills responded: \"We'll see you in court.\"\n\nDetails on new images of subject in Nancy Guthrie disappearance\n\nWatch: Rep.

    "fullText": "Singapore’s Budget for 2026 will be delivered on Thursday (12 Feb) at 3.30pm by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong. He is likely to use his speech to address a number of key issues such as Singaporean concerns over jobs and rising cost of living. PM Wong is also expected to position Singapore as an AI hub and provide an update on Singapore’s Economic Strategy Review. Economists believe this year’s Budget could see a scaling back of the the generous Community Development Council (CDC) voucher scheme seen in previous Budgets.\n\nThe Philippine Embassy in Singapore and the Philippine Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) are both aware of a video circulating online showing a man assaulting a Filipina at Lucky Plaza. DMW Secretary Hans Cacdac was quoted as saying they are looking into it and filing the necessary legal actions.\n\nRead \n\nPrime Minister Lawrence Wong will deliver his 2026 Budget speech on Thursday (12 Feb) at 3.30pm.\n\nThe Budget will be broadcast live on Mediacorp’s Channel 5 but you can also watch a livestream on PM Wong’s own YouTube channel, among other options.\n\nWhat may feature in Budget 2026:\n\nMore support measures for workers will be announced. PM Wong made this point in a YouTube video posted on Wednesday (11 Feb).\n\nPM Wong will likely use his Budget speech to position Singapore as an artificial intelligence (AI) hub, says Bloomberg.\n\nWith a focus on AI, the Government will need to address its potential affect on jobs. Retraining of workers will likely be a significant topic too.\n\nExpect to see more on social safety nets as with Budget 2025 as cost of living concerns remain for an ageing population.\n\nAn update on Singapore’s Economic Strategy Review, which launched last year, is also expected.\n\nThe generous Community Development Council (CDC) voucher scheme in previous Budgets could be scaled back in Budget 2026, with economists expecting smaller payouts and tighter income criteria.\n\nA man is seen arguing with a woman and then kicking her in viral videos taken at Lucky Plaza mall in Orchard Road. Police are now investigating the incident, reports the Straits Times on Thursday (12 Feb).\n\nPolice told the newspaper that a police report was lodged and investigations are ongoing.\n\nEarlier, the Philippine Embassy in Singapore said they were aware of the videos and confirmed the woman who was attacked is a Filipina. Lucky Plaza is a well-known hangout spot for foreign domestic workers on Sundays.\n\n“We continue to closely monitor the situation and remain in contact with the victim to help ensure her safety and well-being,” the embassy said in a statement.\n\nThe Philippine Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) told GMA News they are looking into the possibility of legal action, as reported earlier in this blog on Thursday.\n\nEnforcement operations against motorists who commit traffic violations and cut queues at Woodlands Checkpoint will be stepped up from 13 to 17 February.\n\nThe operations will be carried out by the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) and the Traffic Police.\n\n“Failure to maintain lane discipline and obey traffic rules can cause severe congestion and compromise the safety of other motorists,” ICA said in a Facebook statement on Thursday (12 February).\n\nErrant drivers of foreign-registered vehicles may face entry bans, while Singapore drivers may be referred to the Traffic Police for further investigations and penalties.\n\nMotorists caught engaging in queue cutting will be made to re-queue, warned ICA.\n\nFour-room flats in Tampines had the highest application rates among first-time home buyers in HDB’s latest Build-To-Order (BTO) sales exercise, according to data shared by National Development Minister Chee Hong Tat on Wednesday (11 Feb).\n\nAn application rate is the number of applicants divided by the number of units available. The lower the rate, the higher the chances of success are for the applicant.\n\nChee said, as of 5pm on Wednesday, there had been 14,052 BTO applications. He also listed the following application rates:\n\nBukit Merah (Redhill Peaks): 0.7 for 3-room / 2.0 for 4-room\n\nSembawang (Sembawang Deck): 1.3 for 3-room\n\nSembawang (Sembawang Deck/Sembawang Voyage): 0.6 for 4-room; 0.4 for 5-room\n\nTampines (Tampines Bliss): 3.4 for 3-room\n\nTampines (Tampines Bliss/Tampines Nova): 6.8 for 4-room\n\nToa Payoh (Kim Keat Crest): 0.6 for 3-room; 0.8 for 4-room\n\nApplications closed at 11.59pm on 11 February on the HDB Flat Portal.\n\nYou can \n\nTwo grandsons of OCBC Bank’s founding father Lee Kong Chian have bought big-ticket properties recently, noted the Business Times on Wednesday (11 Feb).\n\nBT’s report said Lee Shih Kwei is acquiring a freehold bungalow in Barker Road for $43.2 million. This follows the recent purchase of two units at the Seven Palms Sentosa Cove condominium for $23.9m by his brother Lee Shih Hua.\n\nKeir Starmer has told Jim Ratcliffe to apologise after the Manchester United co-owner claimed the UK is being “colonised” by immigrants.\n\nRatcliffe, who has lived in tax-free Monaco since 2020, made the comments in an interview with Sky News. “You can't have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in,\" he said. \"I mean, the UK has been colonised. It's costing too much money.”\n\nUK Prime Minister Starmer responded to the remarks on social media platform X, calling it “offensive and wrong.”\n\n“Britain is a proud, tolerant and diverse country. Jim Ratcliffe should apologise,” Starmer said.\n\nOffensive and wrong.\n\nBritain is a proud, tolerant and diverse country.\n\nJim Ratcliffe should apologise.https://t.co/7mSnVV33oo\n\n— Keir Starmer (@Keir_Starmer) February 11, 2026\n\nJames Van Der Beek, known for his starring role in the ‘Dawson’s Creek’ TV show, has died at the age of 48 following a battle with colorectal cancer.\n\nHis wife, Kimberly Van Der Beek, confirmed the sad news in an Instagram announcement on Wednesday (11 Feb). “Our beloved James David Van Der Beek passed peacefully this morning. He met his final days with courage, faith, and grace,” Kimberly said.\n\nShe added: “There is much to share regarding his wishes, love for humanity and the sacredness of time. Those days will come. For now we ask for peaceful privacy as we grieve our loving husband, father, son, brother, and friend.”\n\nVan Der Beek was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in August 2023. He only went public with his stage III cancer battle in November 2024.\n\nThe Philippine Embassy in Singapore says it has taken note of a video circulating online showing a man assaulting a Filipina at Lucky Plaza.\n\nThe Philippine Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) has also weighed in, adding that they are looking into the possibility of legal action, reports GMA News.\n\n“It’s assault, physical assault. It’s a crime anywhere in the world, especially in Singapore. We are looking into it and filing the necessary legal actions,” DMW Secretary Hans Cacdac was quoted as saying.\n\nThe woman has been identified as a Philippine national working in Singapore. It remains unclear what sparked the violent scenes.\n\n“The Embassy, through the Migrant Workers Office (MWO) and the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA), is taking appropriate measures and has reached out to the victim to provide the necessary assistance,” read a statement from The Philippine Embassy. “At this stage, we are mindful not to disclose details that could inadvertently affect ongoing measures or aggravate the situation.”",

    "title": "Psychology Says People Who Can’t Stand An Unmade Bed Share These 9 Habits That Predict Their Future Earnings",
    "description": "These shared habits of chronic bed-makers might predict their future income.",
    "fullText": "My partner thinks I'm insane because I make the bed every single morning. Even if we're running late. Even if I'm exhausted. Even if we're just going to get back in it twelve hours later.\n\nI can't help it. An unmade bed bothers me. Not in a cute, \"oh, I like things tidy\" way. In a visceral, \"I can't focus until this is done\" way.\n\nFor years, I thought this was just a quirk. Maybe a touch of OCD. But then I started noticing that most of the highly successful people I know also make their beds.\n\nI started paying attention. And I realized: people who can't stand unmade beds share a very specific set of habits. Habits that show up everywhere. In their work. Their finances. Their entire approach to life.\n\nAnd those habits? They're the same ones that consistently predict higher earnings and career success. Here's what psychologists have found about people who make their beds—and what it reveals about how they operate in the world.\n\nPeople who make their beds don't just make their beds.\n\nThey put dishes in the dishwasher right away.\n\nThey respond to emails as they come in.\n\nThey handle the little stuff immediately instead of letting it accumulate into an overwhelming pile.\n\nResearch on task completion and productivity found that people who immediately handle small, low-effort tasks report higher overall productivity and lower stress. The cumulative effect of completing minor tasks creates momentum that carries into larger projects.\n\nAnd that habit translates directly to earnings. Because at work, the person who handles small tasks immediately is the person who doesn't drop balls. Who doesn't have a backlog. Who can be trusted to follow through. And that reliability is what gets people promoted and raises their earning potential over time.\n\nMaking the bed is the first thing they accomplish each day. Before coffee. Before checking their phone. Before anything else. They wake up and immediately complete something.\n\nAnd that sets a tone. It creates a sense of momentum. A feeling of \"I've already done something today.\" That psychological boost—starting the day with a win—affects everything that comes after.\n\nStudies tracking morning routines and achievement show that people who begin their day by completing a task, no matter how small, report higher motivation and goal completion rates throughout the day. The act of finishing something early creates a productivity feedback loop.\n\nPeople who start their day with completion tend to end it with more completion. And over time, that compounds. More things finished means more projects delivered. More deliverables mean more recognition. More recognition means higher earnings.\n\nPeople who make their beds every day aren't making them because they feel inspired to make beds. They're making them because it's the thing that happens after they wake up. Motivation has nothing to do with it.\n\nAnd that's how they operate with everything. They don't wait to feel like doing something. They just do it because it's what needs doing. They've separated action from emotion.\n\nResearch on high performers across industries consistently shows that reliance on motivation correlates with lower achievement, while execution independent of emotional state predicts higher earnings. The people who wait to feel like working get less done than the people who work regardless of how they feel.\n\nThe person who doesn't need to feel motivated to perform is the person who's consistent, delivers regardless of their mood, and can be counted on even when things are hard or boring or unrewarding. That consistency is what careers are made of.\n\nThe thing about making your bed every day is that some days you really don't want to. You're exhausted. You're late. You're not feeling it. But they do it anyway.\n\nBecause it's not about wanting to. It's about the system. And they stick to systems even when it's inconvenient.\n\nResearch on self-discipline and financial success shows that people who maintain routines regardless of motivation or mood accumulate significantly more wealth over their lifetimes. The ability to execute on systems when you don't feel like it is a stronger predictor of earnings than talent or intelligence.\n\nThey're the ones who keep working when everyone else has checked out. Who maintain standards when it would be easier not to. Who show up consistently even when they're not inspired. And consistency is what builds careers and bank accounts.\n\nIf you can't stand an unmade bed, you notice when things are off—you see the crooked pillow, the wrinkled duvet, the corner that's not tucked properly. That attention to detail doesn't stop at bedding.\n\nThey notice typos in presentations.\n\nThings that other people miss because they're not looking that closely.\n\nIn professional settings, that's valuable. They catch mistakes before they become problems. They deliver work that doesn't need to be redone. And people who consistently deliver high-quality, detail-oriented work get paid more.\n\nMaking the bed isn't really about the bed. It's about creating order in their environment so they can think clearly. They've learned that external chaos creates internal chaos. So they control what they can control.\n\nStudies on environmental psychology found that people who actively manage their physical spaces report better focus, lower anxiety, and higher task completion rates. The act of creating order externally helps them maintain order internally.\n\nThis translates to earnings because they're more productive. They're not wasting mental energy on clutter or disorder or distracted by their environment. They've set themselves up to focus on what actually matters. And focused people outperform distracted people every single time.\n\nNobody's checking whether they made their bed. There's no bed-making police. No one would know or care if they skipped it. But they do it anyway.\n\nBecause they made a commitment to themselves. And they keep commitments even when no one's watching.\n\nResearch tracking integrity and professional success shows that people who maintain private commitments—promises made only to themselves—demonstrate higher rates of advancement and earnings. The ability to follow through when there's no external accountability is rare and highly valued.\n\nThat integrity shows up at work—they're the ones who finish the project even when the boss isn't checking. They're trusted to do what needs to be done without supervision; that trustworthiness is what gets people into positions of higher responsibility and higher pay.\n\nAnd that habit prevents the chaos that tanks so many people's careers. They're not juggling fifteen half-finished projects. They're not constantly putting out fires they created by not finishing things properly the first time. They close loops. And people who close loops get more opportunities, more responsibility, and more money because they can actually be counted on to finish what they start.\n\nMaking the bed every morning means one less decision. They don't spend mental energy every day deciding whether to make it. The decision was made once, and now it's automatic.\n\nAnd they do this with everything. They have uniforms. Meal routines. Standard responses to common situations. They've automated the small stuff, so their brain is free for the big stuff.\n\nStudies on decision fatigue show that high earners systematically reduce trivial decisions, preserving cognitive resources for high-value choices. The mental energy saved from not deliberating over minor tasks compounds into better strategic thinking and problem-solving.\n\nThis is why they're effective at work. They're not wasting brainpower on things that don't matter. They've systematized the repetitive stuff and saved their thinking for the decisions that actually impact outcomes. And that efficiency means better performance, which means higher pay.\n\nIf something's broken or inefficient, they fix it. They don't just live with the drawer that sticks or the process that doesn't work. They don't develop workarounds. They address the actual problem.\n\nMaking the bed is the same mindset. The bed is unmade—that's a problem. They fix it. They don't just throw the comforter vaguely over it and call it good enough. They don't ignore it and hope someone else deals with it. They actually solve it.\n\nThis shows up everywhere in their professional lives. They're the ones who fix the broken process instead of complaining about it. They identify inefficiencies and actually address them instead of just working around them. They take ownership of problems even when it's not technically their job.\n\nThat proactive problem-solving is what gets people promoted. Organizations are full of people who complain about problems and very few people who actually fix them. The people who fix things without being asked? They're the ones who end up running things. And getting paid accordingly.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Activists planned protests at more than two dozen Target stores around the United States on Wednesday to pressure the discount retailer into taking a public stand against the 5-week-old immigration crackdown in its home state of Minnesota.\n\nICE Out Minnesota, a coalition of community groups, religious leaders, labor unions and other critics of the federal operation, called for sit-ins and other demonstrations to continue at Target locations for a full week. Target's headquarters are located in Minneapolis, where federal officers last month killed two residents who had participated in anti-ICE protests, and its name adorns the city's major league baseball stadium and an arena where its basketball teams plays.\n\n“They claim to be part of the community, but they are not standing up to ICE,” said Elan Axelbank, a member of the Minnesota chapter of Socialist Alternative, which describes itself as a revolutionary political group. He organized a Wednesday protest outside a Target store in Minneapolis' Dinkytown commercial district.\n\nDemonstrations also were scheduled in St. Paul, Minnesota, Boston, Chicago, Honolulu, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Raleigh, North Carolina, San Diego, Seattle and other cities, as well as in suburban areas of Minnesota, California and Massachusetts. Target declined Wednesday to comment on the protests.\n\nTarget first became a bull's-eye for critics of the Trump administration's surge in immigration enforcement activity after a widely-circulated video showed federal agents detaining two Target employees in a store in the Minneapolis suburb of Richfield last month. Luis Argueta, a spokesperson for Unidos Minnesota, an immigrant-led social justice advocacy organization that is part of the ICE Out Minnesota coalition, said his group is focusing its protests on the Richfield store.\n\nOne of the demands of Wednesday’s protests is for Target to deny federal agents entry to stores unless they have judicial warrants authorizing arrests.\n\nSome lawyers have argued that anyone, including U.S. Border Patrol and Immigration and Customers Enforcement agents without signed warrants, can enter public areas of a business as they wish. Public areas include restaurant dining sections, open parking lots, office lobbies and shopping aisles, but not back offices, closed-off kitchens or other areas of a business that are generally off-limits to the public and where privacy would be reasonably expected, those lawyers say.\n\nTarget has not commented publicly on the detention of the store employees. CEO Michael Fiddelke, who became Target's chief executive on Feb. 2, sent a video message to the company’s 400,000 workers two days after a Border Patrol agent and a Customs and Border Protection officer shot and killed Minneapolis resident Alex Pretti on Jan. 24.\n\nFiddelke said the “violence and loss of life in our community is incredibly painful,\" but he did not mention the immigration crackdown or the fatal shootings of Pretti, an ICU nurse at a medical center for U.S. veterans in Minneapolis, and Renee Good, a mother of three fired on in her car by an ICE agent.\n\nFiddelke was one of 60 CEOs of Minnesota-based companies who, in the wake of Pretti's death, signed an open letter \"calling for an immediate de-escalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions.”\n\nThe protests over its alleged failure to oppose the immigration crackdown in Minnesota come a year after Target faced protests and boycotts over the company's decision to roll back its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. At the time, critics said the decision marked a betrayal of Target's retail giant’s philanthropic commitment to fighting racial disparities and promoting progressive values in liberal Minneapolis and beyond.\n\nThe retail chain also is struggling with a persistent sales malaise. Critics have complained of disheveled stores that are missing the budget-priced flair that long ago earned the retailer the nickname “Tarzhay.”\n\nWhile Wednesday's protests targeted a tiny fraction of the company's nearly 2,000 stores, the negative attention serves as another distraction from Target's business, according to Neil Saunders, managing director of the retail division of market research firm GlobalData.\n\n“The agenda has been hijacked by this,” Saunders said. “And it is a bit of a distraction for Target that they’d rather not have.\"\n\nIn recent days, a national coalition of Mennonite congregations organized roughly a dozen demonstrations inside and outside of Target stores across the country, singing and urging Target to publicly call Congress to defund Immigration and Customs Enforcement among other demands.\n\nA spokesperson for Mennonite Action said the coalition was not formally connected to ICE Out but following the lead of organizers in Minneapolis.\n\nThe Rev. Joanna Lawrence Shenk, associate pastor at First Mennonite Church of San Francisco, said the group did not plan any actions on Wednesday but was mapping out weekend singalong events at Targets in a handful of towns and cities, including Pittsburgh and Harrisonburg, Virginia. She estimated that by the end of the weekend more than 1,000 congregation members will have participated.\n\nShenk noted that the Mennonites sing “This Little Light of Mine” and other gospel songs and hymns.\n\n“The singing was an expression of our love for immigrant neighbors who are at risk right now and who are also a part of our congregation,” she said. “For us, it’s not just standing in solidarity with others but it’s also protecting people who are vulnerable.”",

    "fullText": "Six US states are pushing legislation to put a moratorium on artificial intelligence (AI) data center construction.\n\nYahoo Finance Breaking Business News Reporter Jake Conley joins Market Domination Overtime host Josh Lipton to outline the details of these bills and the potential ramifications down the road.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime.\n\nWhich states are pushing back and why are they pushing back?\n\nYeah, Josh, you've got six states with bills being considered right now. You've got Oklahoma, Vermont, and Maryland, but also three major hubs, New York, Georgia, and Virginia, home to Data Center alley in the Lowden area.\n\nThose back three have been huge sites of development. These bills are structured in a few different ways, but the basic underlying principle\n\nis that they look to put a moratorium on data center development. Essentially saying from roughly one year to a roughly three-year window,\n\nyou cannot develop here, you cannot build here until certain hurdles are met or until we get a pipeline cleaned up of requests or ex-conditions are met.\n\nBut essentially this is saying to those developers, these states, if these bills pass, will be walled off to you.\n\nAnd the the real argument here is infrastructure strain. These data centers suck up a lot of energy. They suck up a lot of water. That's going to put pressure on rate payers bills. You already see electricity bills hiking in these areas that have had a lot of development.\n\nYou see water strain in those areas. The grid is under a lot of stress. And so lawmakers are now trying to get ahead of that and saying, wait, wait, wait, slow down. Let's get some stuff on the books, get some regulations in place. But to do that, we want a breather.\n\nWhat what are the chances uh that these bills actually do pass, Jake?\n\nThey're going to face an uphill battle for a few reasons. You got to remember these data centers bring jobs. They bring tax revenue.\n\nAlso, the companies that are behind these centers, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, these aren't easy to push aside. These are companies with real political heft and firepower, with real pressure. And a lot of these governors are at least nominally pro-development.\n\nSo the argument they're going to come up against from these data center developers is, hey, we're bringing you jobs. We're bringing you revenue. Why would you stop us from building? And they're going to face that same kind of push back from business interests, business lobby.\n\nEven if these bills don't go through, you could still see and probably still will see some kind of regulation, cost sharing agreements, water usage parameters. But the focus right now because of their top line impact is on these moratoriums.\n\nHow much, Jake final question, could this all sort of disrupt the great AI ambitions and dreams of Big Tech?\n\nI think the rule with the hyper scales right now is speed, right? There's an arms race going on. You see these companies spending hundreds of billions of dollars on building out this infrastructure. And the game here right now for for Microsoft, for Google, for all these companies building these out is speed.\n\nHow fast can we get these things put up to power the compute that we're trying to put into the market. Any kind of delay there is going to hurt those companies and slow them down.\n\nI was talking to someone today who works in site selection advising these companies on where to go. She was telling me you're already seeing people inside these companies take a second look at some of these spots and say maybe that's not the right idea. Maybe we go somewhere\n\nwith less laws on the rest proposals on the books. The problem is those areas have less infrastructure. So you're going to run into problems wherever you go.\n\nBut regardless, especially in these kind of bigger sites, bigger states where a lot of this development is happening, when the rule of speed, anything that's going to slow speed down is going to be detrimental.\n\nAll right, big story. Thank you Jake for covering it. Appreciate it. Thanks.",

    "fullText": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Nebraska's Republican secretary of state will turn over sensitive information on every registered voter in the state to the U.S. Justice Department on Thursday after Nebraska's highest court rejected a legal effort to block the move.\n\nSecretary of State Bob Evnen told The Associated Press that the Nebraska Supreme Court denied the injunction Wednesday.\n\nLast week, a state judge dismissed the lawsuit filed by government watchdog Common Cause, which sought to stop the release of voter information, including dates of birth, addresses and partial Social Security numbers, to the federal government.\n\n“This case threatens the unprecedented and unlawful release of highly sensitive information of every Nebraska voter,” lawyers for Common Cause wrote in a brief seeking the injunction. “Once the data is released, that bell cannot be unrung.”\n\nThe legal fight in Nebraska comes in the wake of an FBI raid that saw it seize 2020 ballots and other election documents from Georgia’s Fulton County and President Donald Trump declaring he wants to “take over” elections from Democratic-run areas with the November midterms on the horizon.\n\nThe federal Justice Department began last year pushing states to turn over their voter data and other election information. The department has sued at least 23 states and the District of Columbia in its effort to obtain voter rolls.\n\nEvnen said Wednesday that he's giving voter information to the Justice Department so it can assess whether Nebraska is complying with federal voting laws. He noted that the Nebraska Attorney General's office had advised that the federal request “was lawful and proper.”\n\nHis office will upload the information electronically to the Justice Department, he said, and will include a request that privacy laws be observed.\n\nIn a written statement released by his office, Evnen said he is dedicated to protecting voters' personally identifiable information from misuse.\n\nBut when asked if he was positive that Nebraska voter information would be kept secure and not lead to legitimate voters being kicked off voter roles, Evnen responded, “The only thing I'm positive of is that the sun won't catch in a tree when it sets tonight.”\n\nEvnen said the state would not remove people from voter rolls based solely on Department of Justice recommendations. Instead, election officials would conduct their own investigation and would first contact anyone tagged for removal from the rolls.\n\nEarlier this week, a federal judge rejected the department's effort to obtain Michigan’s voter rolls.\n\nThe Justice Department has said it's seeking the data as part of an effort to ensure election security, but Democratic officials say the demand violates state and federal privacy laws. Election officials have raised concerns that federal officials are trying to use the sensitive data for other purposes, such as searching for potential noncitizens on the rolls.\n\nElections in the United States are administered at the state and local level, where individual voter information is kept.",

    "fullText": "Costco’s beloved $1.50 hot dog combo has long been a symbol of unbeatable value at the warehouse club, but now that iconic deal comes with a twist that’s catching shoppers off guard. While the price and classic pairing of a hot dog and soda remain unchanged, the company is tightening the rules on who can actually order it. Find out what you need to know before you next stroll through the food court, and whether this move could change how you enjoy one of Costco’s most famous bargains.\n\nWhile Costco frequently rotates its menu — swapping out sandwiches or debuting a new cookie to keep the bakery crowd curious — certain icons are considered sacred. At the heart of this “hands-off” list is the legendary $1.50 hot dog and soda combo. This deal is more than just a snack; it’s a corporate mandate.\n\nFounder Jim Sinegal’s legendary defense of the price point remains the stuff of retail folklore. As CNBC reported, Sinegal famously said, “If you raise the effing hot dog, I will kill you. Figure it out.” Management has clearly “figured it out,” but not by raising the price. Instead, they are narrowing the guest list.\n\nCostco has spent the last year tightening its borders. What started with digital scanners at warehouse entrances has now officially migrated to the food court. While the public once enjoyed a “gray area” access to those $1.50 franks, especially at outdoor windows, the food court favorite will soon be exclusive to Costco members.\n\nAccording to Sporked, “Costco is rolling out membership-verification technology at its food courts that will require customers to show a valid membership card before ordering food, something select locations have already started testing, and that could become more widespread in 2026.”\n\nSince 2024, Reddit users have been documenting the shift, sharing photos of signs that make the new barrier to entry crystal clear. One such sign reads: “Effective April 8, 2024, an active Costco membership card will be required to purchase items from our food court. You can join today. Please see our membership counter for details.”\n\nTo streamline this enforcement, many locations are now integrating card readers directly into the kiosks. Before you can even order any food, you’ll likely need to swipe or scan your active membership.\n\nThe reasoning behind the move is simple: exclusivity. In a statement reported by Audacy.com, the company explained their stance: “We don’t feel it’s right that nonmembers receive the same benefits and pricing as our members.”",

    "fullText": "There are two fewer places to grab a quick bite near downtown Fresno and Highway 99.\n\nThe KFC and Wendy’s on C and Fresno streets — which operated next door to each other for years — are now closed. The windows are boarded up and the buildings are surrounded by chain-link fence. The signs are gone, only the metal frames remaining. Weeds are starting to grow.\n\nNeither the local management nor the parent company returned messages seeking comment about the closures, which happened in recent weeks.\n\nBut Wendy’s is in the process of closing hundreds of underperforming locations nationwide. It started the closures last year .\n\nIt could close between 240 and 360 restaurants, according to ABC news. It follows a tide of 140 Wendy’s closures that ended in 2024.\n\nThe most recent closures include locations owned by franchisees, said Ken Cook, interim chief executive officer, when announcing the cutbacks in the 2025 third-quarter earnings call in November.\n\nThe underperforming restaurants are a financial drag on the brand, he said. The shutdowns are expected to boost sales at nearby Wendy’s, he said.\n\n“In (some) cases, the solution will be to close consistently underperforming restaurants,” he said in the call. “These actions will strengthen the system and enable franchisees to invest more capital and resources in their remaining restaurants.”\n\nThe closures are a reaction to Wendy’s sales falling 4.7% according to its latest quarterly report. Its rivals, including McDonald’s and Burger King, saw sales rise.\n\nLast month, Wendy’s in Selma, and on Dinuba Boulevard in Visalia also closed, according to the Mid Valley Times.\n\nNo additional Wendy’s locations have been identified for closure in Fresno. JEM Restaurant Management, which owns numerous Wendy’s and KFC franchises in Fresno, did not immediately return calls seeking comment.\n\nWendy’s still has a healthy presence in town, with seven restaurants open in Fresno and one in Clovis.\n\nThe KFC at 1110 C St. has also closed.\n\nIt follows the closure of three other locations in Fresno: The “Next-gen” location Herndon and Spruce avenues, another at First Street and Bullard Avenue, and one at Dakota and West avenues.\n\nAll were owned by JEM Restaurant Management.\n\nThe classic fried chicken chain has struggled in recent years with slipping sales. But the last two quarters, KFC has turned things around, squeezing out an increase in sales.\n\nKFC has six locations in Fresno and two in Clovis.",

    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA recent study offers new insight into the origin of an object known as the Shroud of Turin.\n\nMany consider the sheet to be a holy relic, marked with the impression of a dying man they believe to be Jesus Christ.\n\nUsing open-source 3D modeling software, one researcher showed that, had the cloth really been laid on a real human being, the impression it left would have looked markedly different than what is actually on the sheet\n\nThis story is a collaboration with Biography.com.\n\nThe Shroud of Turin has been the subject of fascination for both believers and skeptics alike since its existence was first recorded in the 14th century.\n\nThe cloth in question appears to depict the face and body of an adult man with long hair and a beard—very similar to style in which Jesus Christ has traditionally been depicted since roughly the 6th century A.D. This outline, while faintly apparent to the naked eye, becomes undeniable when viewed in a photographic negative. As such, there is little doubt now that the face people see on the Shroud of Turin is indeed a deliberate depiction, rather than a trick of the eye as some other ecstatic religious visions can sometimes prove to be. The question, instead, is how that impression got there to begin with.\n\nNow, thanks to one determined researcher and some open-source software, we might finally have found the answer.\n\nThose who believe in the authenticity of the relic suggest that it was the very cloth wrapped around the body of Jesus after his crucifixion, and his divine nature left this eternal impression of his visage.\n\nBut objections have long been raised against this hypothesis—and not just within the secular space. Perhaps the most famous denunciation of the Shroud of Turin came from John Calvin, the 16th-century French theologian who became the namesake of Calvinism. In his Treatise on Relics, he responds almost mockingly to the assertions of the Shroud’s divine origins, asking:\n\n“How is it possible that those sacred historians, who carefully related all the miracles that took place at Christ’s death, should have omitted to mention one so remarkable as the likeness of the body of our Lord remaining on its wrapping sheet? This fact undoubtedly deserved to be recorded.”\n\nCalvin cites several Biblical reasons as to why this couldn’t have happened—from the fact that none of the disciples ever mentioned seeing such an impression on the shroud, to the fact that the Roman soldiers weren’t exactly on friendly terms with the Followers of Christ, so it’s unlikely they would have let them abscond with such a sacred item. Plus, he notes, St. John said that Jesus was buried “according to the manner of the Jews.” Were this in fact the case, the body and head would have been wrapped with two separate cloths, not one.\n\n“In short,” Calvin concluded, “...either St John is a liar, or all those who boast of possessing the holy sudary are convicted of falsehood and deceit.”\n\nCalvin didn’t go so far as to posit an alternative theory. Perhaps he didn’t want to speculate. Perhaps he was simply too busy to spend time on the subject—he did have a lot of writing to do (and at least one soon-to-be-set-on-fire heretic to testify against).\n\nOr maybe he just didn’t have access to open-source software like Blender.\n\nThankfully, Cicero Moraes—a researcher and 3D designer from Brazil—did have that software handy. And he used it to test a theory first posited by Walter McCrone in the 1980s: that the image on the Shroud of Turin isn’t an impression at all, but rather “an inspired painting,” perhaps made in part by using a low-relief sculpture rather than a full three-dimensional figure.\n\nAt the core of this theory is one idea: had the cloth received its markings from a three-dimensional figure, the image of the face and body would appear flattened and distorted on the unfolded cloth.\n\nTo prove this, Moraes created a model in the software MakeHuman under the parameters “male, adult, ≈33 years old, thin and ≈1.80m tall.” Then, he transferred that model over to the free, open-source software Blender in order to refine the details to match the figure on the Shroud of Turin.\n\nMoraes then compared how a fabric wrapped around that three-dimensional model would look (compared to one laid on a low-relief sculpture), and what type of pattern both would leave.\n\nMoraes models demonstrated that, when a three-dimensional object does leave marks on a piece of fabric, those stains “generate a more robust and more deformed structure in relation to the source.” What you’re seeing when you look at an impression made of a human face on a piece of fabric is a flattening of a three-dimensional object.\n\nIf you were to take, say, a globe, slather it with ink, and wrap a cloth around it, when you unfolded that sheet, you’d find an image that looked a good deal different than the globe's rounded shape.\n\nBut if you’d rather not get your perfectly good globe dirty, you could just watch the video Moraes’ made to accompany his study notes. Anyone can test this out for themselves by covering their face with a pigmented liquid and laying a fabric or paper towel over it.\n\nThe details of Moraes’ findings have been published in an article for Archaeometry, including acknowledgements of all of the software Moraes employed. It concludes that the image on the Shroud of Turin is almost certainly a work of medieval art, rather than an authentic impression from a dying man.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "PORTSMOUTH — Police said a man was hospitalized Feb. 11 after an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound on the property of the condemned Antiquarian Bookstore, where the store's owner has been at the center of an eviction dispute with the city.\n\nThe man, whose identity was not immediately released, was found unresponsive in the parking lot of the closed-down business by responding city police and fire crews. He was initially transported to Portsmouth Regional Hospital but has since been flown to a Boston area hospital due to the extent of his injuries, police said in a late-afternoon update.\n\nA passerby in a car called police at 12:22 p.m. to report seeing a bleeding man lying on the ground on the property, according to Deputy Police Chief Michael Maloney.\n\nCrime scene tape was posted around the 1070 Lafayette Road property as city authorities investigated the scene.\n\nPolice did not disclose the man's condition.\n\nLt. Brian Houde stated previously there is no danger to the public associated with the incident. No further information was expected to be released Feb. 11, according to Maloney.\n\nPortsmouth Fire Chief Bill McQuillen deferred comment to city police.\n\nPortsmouth police are continuing to probe the incident. Members of the public are asked to contact Det. Capt. David Keaveny (603) 610-7511 with information pertaining to the incident.\n\nWalter Wakefield is the longtime owner of the now-defunct bookstore. Wakefield recently dropped his eviction appeal after the case reached the New Hampshire Supreme Court.\n\n“I’m in all this trouble now and waiting to be disposed of by the city,\" Wakefield recently told Seacoastonline, noting he is 80 years old. Wakefield is known to spend much of his time on the property in one of 21 book-filled cars.\n\nMore: Portsmouth store owner ends fight; awaits fate of 21 book-filled cars\n\nPortsmouth District Court Judge John Pendleton ordered Wakefield, along with his vehicles filled with books, to vacate the property in a summer 2025 eviction order. Over $3 million in fines from the city have accrued since summer 2024 due to the vehicles not being taken off the property, though city attorneys have stated they would waive the penalties upon their removal.\n\nAn attempt to contact Wakefield after the incident was unsuccessful.\n\nThe building was constructed in 1973, according to the city property records.\n\nThe National Alliance on Mental Illness - New Hampshire offers the following resources to those in distress:\n\n988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline – Call or text 988 for 24/7, free and confidential support for people in distress, prevention and crisis resources for you or your loved ones, and best practices for professionals.

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A former federal prosecutor who quit amid a dispute with the Trump administration is now representing former CNN host Don Lemon, who was one of nine people indicted for their alleged roles in disrupting a service at a Minnesota church where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official was a pastor.\n\nA court filing Tuesday shows that Lemon has hired former interim U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, who had been leading the sprawling investigation and prosecution of major fraud cases for the Minnesota U.S. Attorney’s Office until he resigned last month.\n\nSeveral prosecutors have now left the office at a time of growing frustration with the administration’s immigration enforcement crackdown and the Justice Department’s response to fatal shootings of two people by federal officers in Minneapolis.\n\nLemon had previously said through another attorney that he planned to plead not guilty to federal civil rights charges over his coverage of the church protest. He has said he was not affiliated with the group that disrupted the church service, and that he was there in his capacity as an independent journalist. The indictment alleges various actions by the group that entered the church, including what Lemon said as he reported on the event for his livestream show.\n\nLemon is scheduled to be arraigned on Feb. 13 in federal court in St. Paul.\n\nThe Trump administration has cited the Minnesota fraud cases, in which most defendants have come from the state’s large Somali community, as justification for its immigration crackdown in the state. Thompson estimated in December that the losses to taxpayers from several fraud cases being prosecuted in Minnesota could total $9 billion.\n\nThompson recently formed his own law firm with Harry Jacobs, another former federal prosecutor who resigned amid the upheaval in the office. Jacobs had been lead prosecutor in the case of Vance Boelter, who has pleaded not guilty in last year's assassination of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the nonfatal shootings of a state senator and his wife.\n\nThe firm's website describes them as “battle tested and seasoned” trial lawyers.\n\nThompson did not immediately reply to messages seeking comment Tuesday.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump attacked the Republican leader of the National Governors Association on Wednesday as tensions mounted between the White House and the bipartisan group of state leaders ahead of ...",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump attacked the Republican leader of the National Governors Association on Wednesday as tensions mounted between the White House and the bipartisan group of state leaders ahead of its annual meeting next week.\n\nIn a social media post, Trump blasted Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican who chairs the NGA, as a “RINO,” meaning Republican in Name Only. Trump said Stitt “incorrectly stated my position on the very exclusive Governors Annual Dinner and Meeting at the White House.”\n\nThe dispute centers on whether Trump would allow governors from both major parties to participate in the full range of White House events, which typically includes a business meeting and meal. In a letter to fellow governors on Monday, Stitt said the NGA was informed that the White House planned to limit invitations to the business meeting to Republicans. That prompted an outcry from Democrats, who said they wouldn't participate in the meal if they weren’t fully included at the business meeting.\n\n“I am writing to inform you that President Donald J. Trump is inviting all governors of the 55 States and territories to the Friday, Feb. 20 NGA Business Breakfast at 8:30am est.,” Stitt wrote. “He was very clear in his communications with me that this is a National Governors Association’s event, and he looks forward to hosting you and hearing from governors across the country. President Donald Trump said this was always his intention, and we have addressed the misunderstanding in scheduling.”\n\nTrump, however, struck a far more adversarial tone in his social media post, calling Stitt's Monday letter “false.”\n\n“The invitations were sent to ALL Governors, other than two, who I feel are not worthy of being there,” he wrote, referring to Democratic Govs. Wes Moore of Maryland and Jared Polis of Colorado.\n\nTrump added: “I look forward to seeing the Republican Governors, and some of the Democrats Governors who were worthy of being invited, but most of whom won’t show up.”\n\nFollowing Trump's post, Brandon Tatum, the NGA's chief executive, stood by the group's timeline of events.\n\n“As of Tuesday evening, only Republican Governors received invites from the White House for the Friday morning business meeting,” he said in a statement. “We are hopeful that we can have constructive bipartisan dialogue with the President during the session. Continuing the tradition of the business meeting is an important step toward bridge building among parties.”\n\nFor now, it's unclear how many Democrats will show up at the White House. Some, including Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, said Wednesday they didn't plan to attend the meeting. Others, such as Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut, signaled they would participate.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that Trump has “discretion to invite anyone he wants to the White House.”\n\nThe spat is a reminder of the challenge facing bipartisan or nonpartisan organizations in Trump's Washington. The U.S. Conference of Mayors, which includes city leaders from both parties, met in Washington earlier this month but wasn't invited to the White House.\n\nThe governor's meeting, typically a low-key event, took a sharper edge last year when Trump returned to the White House.\n\nThe president singled out Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, over his administration's effort to bar transgender athletes from competing in girls’ and women’s sports. He threatened to withhold federal funding from the state if she did not comply, prompting Mills to retort, “We’ll see you in court.”\n\nTrump predicted that Mills’ political career would be over for opposing the order, though she is now running for U.S. Senate on a staunch anti-Trump agenda.\n\nThe back-and-forth had a lasting impact on last year’s conference and some Democratic governors did not renew their dues last year to the bipartisan group.",

    "description": "Following James Van Der Beek’s death, experts reveal a possible link between one daily soda and advanced colon cancer.",
    "fullText": "James Van Der Beek's tragic death at 48 has reignited urgent questions about what may be fueling the rise of aggressive colon cancer in younger adults.\n\nAs doctors examine possible risk factors, new research suggests that even a single daily sugary drink could be linked to late-stage disease, raising concerns about a habit millions consider harmless.\n\nThe death of James Van Der Beek at age 48 stunned fans and reignited urgent conversations about colorectal cancer in younger adults.\n\nOnce considered a disease primarily affecting older populations, colon cancer has been steadily rising among people under 50.\n\nSince the 1990s, early-onset cases have surged by 50 percent, and projections suggest rates could double between 2010 and 2030.\n\nColorectal cancer now ranks as the fourth most common cancer in the United States and the second-leading cause of cancer deaths.\n\nThe American Cancer Society estimates that 154,270 Americans will be diagnosed this year, and 52,900 will die.\n\nIn the UK, more than 44,000 cases are diagnosed annually, with over 16,800 deaths each year.\n\nVan Der Beek's passing followed a public two-year battle with the disease. His loved ones shared the heartbreaking news in an emotional Instagram statement.\n\nIt read, \"Our beloved James David Van Der Beek passed peacefully this morning. He met his final days with courage, faith, and grace. There is much to share regarding his wishes, love for humanity, and the sacredness of time. Those days will come. For now, we ask for peaceful privacy as we grieve our loving husband, father, son, brother, and friend.\"\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Kimberly, and their six children.\n\nAmid growing concern, researchers have zeroed in on dietary patterns that may influence advanced disease.\n\nA new study suggests that consuming at least one sugary soda or candy every day could be linked specifically to late-stage colon cancer, the hardest-to-treat form.\n\nDr. Emma Schatoff, a medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who led the research, described what doctors were seeing in younger patients.\n\n\"Young people were coming in with metastatic disease, or cancer that had spread everywhere – it was in their liver, lungs, other organs – and they were very surprised,\" she told the Daily Mail.\n\nHer team examined numerous possible risk factors. She shared, \"We looked at anything that could have raised their risk level. We looked at inflammatory bowel disease and medication use, but found no difference there.\"\n\nThe results surprised even the researchers. Dr. Schatoff said, \"Then we looked at diet, and found no link with processed foods or red meat. But we did find a link with high sugar foods in stage four patients diagnosed with the disease for the first time.\"\n\nSchatoff clarified what the researchers meant by high sugar intake. She said, \"We defined a high sugar diet as daily consumption of high sugar foods, such as a [single] soda or a candy.\"\n\nThe study followed 303 colon cancer patients under 50 years old. Among them, 112 were diagnosed with stage four cancer, while 191 had stages one through three.\n\nEach participant completed a detailed dietary questionnaire that asked, \"Two to five years before diagnosis, how often did you have one serving of high sugar foods (eg soft drinks, candy).\"\n\nThe differences were striking. Forty-five percent of stage four patients reported daily consumption of high sugar foods, compared with just 29 percent in patients whose cancers had not spread as aggressively.\n\nThe researchers concluded, \"In a single-center study, in early-onset colon cancer patients, high sugar diets may be associated with de novo [new] metastatic disease.\"\n\nThe findings were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual conference in Chicago, attended by around 40,000 cancer specialists.\n\nWhile the results have been published as an abstract and have not yet undergone peer review in a scientific journal, they have intensified debate about sugar's role in disease progression.\n\nScientists suspect that sugar may alter the gut microbiome, the complex ecosystem of bacteria living in the digestive tract. Excess sugar that is not fully absorbed can accumulate in the colon, potentially increasing inflammation and fueling tumor growth. Some research suggests sugar may act as direct fuel for cancer cells, accelerating their expansion.\n\nA separate study last year found that diets high in sugar and low in fiber can promote the growth of Fusobacterium, a bacteria linked to inflammation and tumor development. Chronic inflammation can age cells and increase vulnerability to cancer-causing mutations.\n\nWhat makes these findings especially concerning is how common sugary beverages are.\n\nAccording to the CDC, an estimated 63 percent of American adults report consuming at least one soda per day. For many, it is simply part of routine life.\n\nYet the new research suggests that even one daily serving of a sugary drink or candy may be associated with more advanced disease at diagnosis.\n\nThe stage four patients in the study were slightly younger on average, 41 years old, compared to 43 years old in the earlier-stage group. Just over half of the participants were women, and none had a prior cancer diagnosis.\n\nThe study found no association between colon cancer and consumption of red meat, processed foods, fruits, vegetables, fish, poultry, or dairy.\n\nThat absence of links makes the sugar-specific findings particularly striking.\n\nAs conversations continue following James Van Der Beek's death, doctors emphasize that research is ongoing and that no single factor determines cancer risk.\n\nStill, the potential connection between daily sugar intake and advanced colon cancer adds another layer of urgency to understanding why more young adults are being diagnosed.\n\nFor families grappling with loss and patients confronting the disease, the message is sobering.\n\nWhat once seemed like a harmless indulgence may warrant closer scrutiny.\n\nAs awareness grows, researchers hope that uncovering these patterns will lead to earlier detection, better prevention strategies, and ultimately fewer stories like that of James Van Der Beek.",

    "description": "Musk addressed the company for the first time since its merger with SpaceX and shared the plans for the company's restructuring.",
    "fullText": "XAI just had its first all-hands meeting since its merger with SpaceX.\n\nIn the recorded event on Tuesday night, CEO Elon Musk outlined a new organizational structure — the main Grok product and Grok Voice, Grok Code, Grok Imagine, and the company's Macrohard project. The all-hands was later posted on X on Wednesday.\n\nFrom a plan to build a catapult, or mass driver, on the moon to soothing nerves after the restructuring, here are the main takeaways from xAI's latest all-hands meeting.\n\nThere are now only six members left of an original founding team of 12 at xAI, following two more exits earlier this week.\n\nMusk addressed the new restructuring.\n\n\"Because we've reached a certain scale, we're organizing the company to be more effective at this scale,\" said Musk. \"Now, naturally, when this happens, there are some people who are better suited for the early stages of a company and less suited for the later stages.\"\n\nOn Monday, Tony Wu announced his resignation in a post on X, writing that it was \"time for my next chapter.\" Less than 24 hours later, fellow cofounder Jimmy Ba followed suit, posting that Tuesday was his last day and thanking Musk for \"bringing us together on this incredible journey.\"\n\nMusk is promising the moon, literally.\n\n\"Ultimately, we see a path to maybe launching as much as a terawatt per year of compute from earth, but what if you want to go beyond a mere terawatt per year?\" said Musk. \"In order to do that, you have to go to the moon.\"\n\nHis goal is to launch AI sattelites from the moon, he told employees.\n\n\"I can't imagine anything more epic than a mass driver on the moon and a self-sustaining city on the moon, and then going beyond the moon to Mars, going throughout our solar system, and ultimately being out there among the stars and visiting all these star systems,\" Musk added. \"Maybe we'll meet aliens.\"\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai is also researching the feasability of data centers in space, citing limited resources on Earth, such as water and electricity. Data centers are already facing backlash for driving up utility costs for average households.\n\nA stand-alone app for XChat and a new transaction app called X Money are coming in the next few months, according to Musk.\n\nDuring the all-hands meeting, Musk said that users who only want to use the messaging function could use the standalone XChat app without visiting the X platform. He said the app will also be on desktop and can handle multi-user video calls.\n\n\"For XMoney, we actually had XMoney live in closed beta within the company, and we expect in the next month or two to go to a limited external beta and then to go worldwide to all X users,\" said Musk.\n\n\"And this is really intended to be the place where all the money is, the central source of all monetary transactions,\" Musk added. \"So it's really going to be a game changer.\"",

    "description": "US mogul skier Tess Johnson credits her daily habit as \"just a way to stay present and get off my phone from time to time.\"",
    "fullText": "Olympic skier Tess Johnson, 25, starts and ends every day with the same ritual that helps her perform under pressure.\n\nIn an interview with Town & Country Magazine published on Wednesday, the American mogul skier said she always packs her journal when she travels for competitions.\n\n\"I do a little bit of journaling in the morning to set my day, set my goals for the day and a little bit of gratitude, but then in the evening I let it all out and it's a little bit like word vomit, but whatever I need to just get out to get a good night of sleep,\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson made the US national team at 14 — the youngest athlete to do so at the time — and later became the youngest American freestyle skier to medal at the World Championships.\n\nShe debuted at the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics and reached the finals at the 2026 Milan Cortina Games, where she finished 10th.\n\nJohnson, whose grandfather was a former Sports Illustrated writer who covered the Olympics, said journaling plays a key role in her mental preparation.\n\nShe believes she inherited her love of writing from her grandfather and now uses journaling as a practical training tool to track her progress in skiing.\n\n\"And also an emotional tool to just work through whatever anxieties are happening because this is a very intense sport and process that we're going through,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"It's really helpful to get it all out on paper and sift through it just by putting pen to paper. So it does a lot for me. And at the very least, it's just a way to stay present and get off my phone from time to time,\" she continued.\n\nJohnson added that she occasionally rereads her old journals, including those from the 2018 Olympics.\n\n\"It's really cool to see the progress I've made over the years,\" she said.\n\nApart from being a part of her daily routine, journaling is also a key part of her pre-race ritual.\n\n\"The night before I like to journal, whatever in training that day, any other thoughts that I need to get out. Then the morning of, I'll write down three goals for the day, usually relating to my skiing or a mental performance goal, or just something even maybe not related to skiing, just that I have for the day, and then I'll write down a couple things that I'm grateful for as well,\" Johnson said, adding that she does her warm ups after that.\n\nJohnson isn't the only elite athlete who has embraced journaling as part of their routine.\n\nMichael Phelps told Business Insider in 2023 that he uses writing to reflect and unwind, while WNBA star Caitlin Clark has incorporated journaling into her pregame ritual to clear her head and stay focused.\n\nMeanwhile, other Olympians are leaning into surprisingly old-school hobbies in their downtime, including cross-country skier Ben Ogden, who said knitting helps him relax.",

    "description": "Russian authorities said two major airlines were flying one-way flights out of Cuba, as the Trump administration pressures the island's oil supply.",
    "fullText": "Moscow's civil aviation authority said on Wednesday that two major Russian airlines are helping to repatriate its citizens from Cuba amid a jet fuel shortage on the island.\n\nThe agency, Rosaviatsia, said that Rossiya Airlines had changed its flight schedule \"to ensure the evacuation of Russian tourists currently in Cuba.\"\n\nRossiya, which is owned by Russian aviation giant Aeroflot, and Nordwind Airlines, a Russian luxury airline, announced on the same day that they would suspend flights to Cuba and offer only one-way tickets out of the island.\n\nAll parties cited \"difficulties with refueling aircraft in Cuba.\"\n\n\"Starting February 12, a number of one-way return flights will be operated from Havana and Varadero to Moscow to accommodate Russian tourists currently in Cuba,\" wrote Rossiya Airlines.\n\nNordwind Airlines, a Russian leisure airline, said it would fly only repatriation flights from the resort locations of Varadero, Holguin, and Cayo Coco.\n\nThe Russian Union of Travel Industry estimated last week that at least 4,000 Russian tourists are in Cuba.\n\nThe announcements came after Cuban aviation authorities warned on Monday that the island would not have jet fuel available at international airports for a month.\n\nCuba heavily depends on Venezuela for oil, but has stopped receiving imports since January 3, when Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was captured by US forces.\n\nMexico ranks in distant second place as an oil supplier to Cuba, but it also halted exports to the island after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on countries that send oil to Havana.\n\nCanadian airlines, which run some of the highest-traffic routes to Cuba, said they were canceling flights to the island from Monday onward. Air Canada, WestJet, and Air Transat said they would fly empty planes to Cuba to pick up passengers.\n\nThe Russian airlines are following suit.\n\nRossiya said in a follow-up statement that it was organizing at least six one-way flights from Cuban airports to Moscow, and that it would suspend all operations to the island nation by February 24.\n\nBoth Rossiya and Nordwind said they were offering refunds to affected passengers.\n\n\"Both parties are exploring alternative options to resume flights in both directions in the interests of citizens of both countries,\" Rosaviatsia wrote.\n\nCuba has long been considered a close ally of Moscow and a stronghold of Soviet and Russian influence in Latin America.\n\nRussia, isolated by international sanctions for its war against Ukraine, has recently sought to expand economic and trade ties with Cuba, encouraging Russian companies in banking, agriculture, IT, and other industries to begin operations on the island.\n\nIn September, Ukrainian intelligence officials said that the Kremlin recruited over 20,000 Cuban citizens as mercenaries to fight Kyiv's forces, with the island ranking among the top suppliers of foreign fighters.\n\nTrump said earlier this month that his administration was in discussions with Cuba as he ramps up pressure on the island.\n\n\"I think we're going to make a deal with Cuba,\" he told reporters.\n\nRussia is not the only one to chafe at Cuba's situation. On Tuesday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said at a press briefing that Beijing \"stands firmly against the inhumane actions that deprive the Cuban people of their right to subsistence and development.\"\n\n\"China will, as always, do our best to provide support and assistance to Cuba,\" said spokesperson Lin Jian.",

    "description": "A bipartisan coalition in the House delivered a rare rebuke of Trump's tariffs by voting against his duties on Canada, citing economic concerns.",
    "fullText": "The US and Canada relationship has been tense since President Donald Trump took office a second time and began levvying tariffs on the neighbor to the north and throwing around the term \"51st state.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Congress delivered a rare bipartisan rebuke of Trump's tariffs on Canada — even as the president escalated the spat this week.\n\nOn Wednesday, the House voted to block Trump's tariffs on Canada by passing a resolution introduced by Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York that would rescind the tariffs Trump imposed on the neighbor under a national emergency declaration.\n\nAs tensions with the US's closest trading partner continue to escalate, the measure cleared the chamber 219 to 211, with six Republicans joining Democrats to defy Trump and GOP leadership. One Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, voted against it.\n\nThe vote came a day after Republican leaders failed to block the effort through a procedural maneuver, when three GOP lawmakers sided with Democrats to allow debate to move forward. Trump publicly warned Republicans not to cross him and threatened political retaliation against anyone who voted against tariffs.\n\n\"Any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social ahead of the vote.\n\nBoth Republicans who defected and Democrats cite economic impacts as their primary reason for opposing tariffs.\n\n\"Today's vote is simple, very simple: Will you vote to lower the cost of living for the American family or will you keep prices high out of loyalty to one person, Donald J. Trump?\" said Meeks, who authored the resolution, ahead of the vote.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat, said in a statement after the vote that \"sycophantic Republicans in the House have tried to block us from acting on behalf of the American people\" and that Trump's tariffs were \"causing prices to skyrocket and creating unnecessary uncertainty for American families\".\n\n\"As an old fashioned Conservative I know tariffs are a tax on American consumers,\" said Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, who voted against tariffs on Canada alongside the Democrats. Bacon will be retiring and won't seek reelection in the midterm.\n\nThe resolution now heads to the Senate. But even if it passes, Trump is expected to veto it, making the effort largely symbolic.\n\nThe congressional rebellion comes as Trump's dispute with Canada intensifies. In January, Trump threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Canada after Prime Minister Mark Carney reached a trade agreement with China, which offered China a quota for EV exports in exchange for certain agricultural tariffs on Canada being dropped. Trump then threatened to block the opening of a new bridge between Michigan and Ontario, and demanded some ownership of the bridge that Canada paid for.\n\nThough a conversation between Carney and Trump has de-escalated threats on the bridge, it is clear that sentiment toward the US in Canada has soured.\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada, Canadians returning to Canada after traveling in the US took a dive in early 2025 and are down about a quarter from the year before as of November 2025. After Canadian provinces launched a boycott against American alcohol products, US spirits exports to Canada plummeted 85% in the second quarter of 2025 and fell below $10 million in export value, according to the Distilled Spirits Council.",

    "fullText": "You're not the only one with a strange sleep routine.\n\nIn a video interview with Fortune released on Wednesday, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said he sleeps very little and splits his waking hours into two working days.\n\n\"I do try and get six, but I have unusual sleeping habits,\" he said, about his number of hours of sleep. \"I sort of manage during the day.\"\n\nHe said that any less sleep than that would be bad for the brain.\n\nHassabis cofounded DeepMind in 2010, which Google acquired in 2014. It merged with Google Brain in 2023 to form Google DeepMind, the lab behind tools such as Gemini and Nano Banana. The CEO and a DeepMind coworker, John Jumper, were awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for their work on protein structure prediction.\n\nHassabis said that he tries to pack his day in the office with as many meetings as possible with \"almost no time\" in between. He then gets home, spends time with family, and has dinner.\n\n\"Then I sort of start a second day of work about 10 p.m. and go to 4 a.m., where I do my thinking and kind of more creative work and research work,\" he said.\n\nThe CEO added that he's followed this schedule for about a decade. Hassabis earlier spoke about his sleep routine in a 2017 interview with BBC Radio.\n\n\"I can't imagine being creative at four in the morning. But, I come alive at about 1 a.m.,\" he told Fortune's Alyson Shontell.\n\nHassabis' routine matches what other tech founders have shared about their sleep schedules, especially during the early stages of founding or growing their businesses.\n\nElon Musk has said that he functions best with about six hours of sleep — any less affects his performance. In a 2018 interview with Bloomberg, Musk said that he slept on the floor of a Tesla factory during some production periods.\n\nMarc Benioff, meanwhile, said in a 2023 interview that he averages about eight hours of sleep.",

    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest have sacked Sean Dyche as head coach after just 114 days in charge and are looking for their fourth boss of the season.\n\nForest were held to a goalless draw at home by bottom club Wolves on Wednesday and are just three points above the Premier League relegation zone with 12 games remaining.\n\nDyche, 54, succeeded Ange Postecoglou in October and had signed a contract until the summer of 2027.\n\n\"Nottingham Forest Football Club can confirm that Sean Dyche has been relieved of his duties as head coach,\" a statement read.\n\n\"We would like to thank Sean and his staff for their efforts during their time at the club and we wish them the best of luck for the future. We will be making no further comment at this time.\"\n\nPostecoglou lasted just 39 days in the job after replacing Nuno Espirito Santo, who was sacked just three matches into the 2025-26 campaign.\n\nThey look set to become the first Premier League club to have four permanent managers in one season.\n\nDyche took over at the City Ground with Forest 18th in the table after one win in eight games during a difficult start to the season.\n\nAfter a 2-0 defeat by Bournemouth in his first match in charge, Dyche led Forest to four wins and one draw in their next seven to guide them out of the drop zone.\n\nA run of four consecutive defeats followed, but Dyche's side responded with a four-match unbeaten run - including a 2-1 win at fellow strugglers West Ham and a resilient goalless draw with leaders Arsenal.\n\nHowever, the improved form of Leeds United and West Ham has kept Forest mired in the relegation battle.\n\nForest finished 13th in the Europa League group table, with four wins, two draws and two defeats in their eight matches, to reach the knockout phase.\n\nThey face Turkish side Fenerbahce over two legs this month for the chance to reach the last 16, with the first leg taking place on Thursday, 19 February.\n\nForest are out of both domestic cup competitions, losing 3-2 to Swansea under Postecoglou in the EFL Cup third round in September and exiting the FA Cup on penalties to another Championship side, Wrexham, in the third round under Dyche last month.\n\nAfter being in contention for Champions League qualification for much of last season, Forest picked up just eight points from their final eight matches.\n\nThey finished seventh and qualified for the Conference League but were moved into the Europa League for 2025-26 at Crystal Palace's expense after the Eagles were deemed to be in breach of multi-club ownership rules.\n\nDuring that downturn in form, Nuno's relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis deteriorated and he was sacked in September.\n\nDyche was on the books of Forest as a youth-team player in the late 1980s when Brian Clough was manager, but never made a first-team appearance.\n\nHe was previously in charge of Everton before being sacked after just under two years in charge of the Toffees in January 2025.\n\nPrior to that Dyche spent nearly a decade as Burnley manager between October 2012 and April 2022, twice winning promotion to the top flight and helping the Clarets qualify for Europe for the first time since 1967.\n\nHe also had a stint in charge of Watford for the 2011–12 season, only to lose his job following a change of ownership.\n\nFollowing Forest's 0-0 draw with Wolves on Wednesday, Dyche sounded like a man who knew what was to follow.\n\nAfter an incredible 35 attempts on goal without scoring - more attempts than any team Dyche has managed in his 351 games in charge - the draw left them just three points clear of the drop zone.\n\nA frustrated Marinakis was pictured frequently during the City Ground draw with him appearing to be growing increasingly frustrated with every missed opportunity.\n\nPost match - and before his dismissal - Dyche said: \"The owner has been fair to me, without a shadow of a doubt. If anyone chooses to change in football now, that's their decision. We've all seen it.\n\n\"People can demand change, and then it's always whether they change or not.\n\n\"If the owner wants to make a change then that's up to him, and that's the way football is now, that's just the reality of it.\n\n\"I understand the noise here has changed significantly since the last few games.\"\n\nDyche undoubtedly arrived at Forest in difficult circumstances, but he appeared to steady the ship after a poor run of results under Postecoglou, winning seven of his first 12 games.\n\nIf results were taken from when Dyche took over, Forest would be mid-table, six points above third-from-bottom Tottenham.\n\nHe was even nominated for Premier League manager of the month a week ago, with two wins and one loss from their past six matches.\n\nSpeaking on Match of the Day, just an hour before Dyche's dismissal, ex-England striker Alan Shearer backed the former Burnley boss.\n\nHe said: \"I think with his know-how and his experience in the Premier League, I would without a doubt stick with Sean.\"\n\nFormer Tottenham midfielder Danny Murphy, added: \"I think for this battle at the bottom you wouldn't want a better manager than him.\n\n\"He's been there, done it, he stays calm. I think they'd be crazy to get rid of him.\n\n\"The other thing as well I suppose for Marinakis is if it wasn't for him they wouldn't be in the Premier League and they wouldn't be in Europe.\n\n\"So maybe he's got the right to do what he wants, but I don't think there's a manager you could bring in who is as capable as [Dyche] in this fight.\"\n\nNuno was sacked 23 days into the season.\n\nHis replacement Postecoglou lasted 39 days.\n\nDyche at least made it past the 100-day mark, but his reign ends after 114.\n\nNottingham Forest are now remarkably searching for a fourth manager of a season which has lurched from crisis to crisis.\n\nForest's problems are of their own making after Nuno fell out with global sporting director Edu and owner Marinakis to make his position untenable.\n\nPostecoglou was an ill-advised appointment, a clash of styles going from Nuno's counter-attack to the Australian's high-pressing, high-action game.\n\nDyche was supposed to be the safe pair of hands, reverting back to what the squad knew under Nuno, and his connection with the club - having come through the academy - initially made it a sweet homecoming.\n\nSeven wins from his first 12 stabilised the club and season to a point, with Forest mid-table in the league if results since Dyche was appointed in October were only taken into account.\n\nBut just two wins in their past 10 league games - plus an FA Cup exit to Wrexham last month - saw a rapid loss of faith from both the board and the fans.\n\nThe season is now an embarrassment for Forest. It was not supposed to be like this, with European football returning to the City Ground for the first time since 1995-96.\n\nBut after two failed appointments and the decision to sack Nuno after a breakdown in relationships Forest are in tatters.\n\nThey finished seventh last season and spent £180m but relegation is a very real possibility in a season where the club, especially Postecoglou, had targeted winning the Europa League.\n\nLatest Nottingham Forest news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Nottingham Forest - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "With many unable to access or afford qualified therapists, AI is filling the mental healthcare vacuum, amid calls for tighter regulation\n\nOn a quiet evening in her Abuja hotel, Joy Adeboye, 23, sits on her bed clutching her phone, her mind racing and chest tightening. On her screen is yet another abusive message from her stalker – a man she had met nine months earlier at her church.\n\nHe had asked Adeboye out; when she declined, he began sending her intimidating, insulting and blackmailing messages on social media, as well as spreading false information about her online. There were even death threats.\n\nThe experience is taking its toll on her mental health, leaving her struggling to cope. Family and friends she confided in did not take it seriously, and she cannot afford in-person therapy or counselling. As the feeling of panic rose at the sight of his words, she turns to an alternative: a WhatsApp chatbot called Chat Kemi.\n\n“Good evening, Resilient Joy,” the bot types. “How are you today?”\n\n Adeboye hesitates, then starts typing: “Someone is defaming me online and threatening to kill me, because I refused to date him. I am depressed and confused. What should I do?”\n\nThe chatbot, which Adeboye had heard about at an event on gender-based violence run by an NGO, advises her to deactivate her social media accounts and provide all necessary information about the person making the threats to someone she trusts.\n\nFor the first time in months, Adeboye says, she felt less alone.\n\nAI platforms offering first-line mental health support have proliferated over the past year, with early trials in the US showing mixed results. In Nigeria, where AI has been embraced in many sectors and industries, a growing number of people turn to chatbots for virtual therapy.\n\nNigeria’s health system, including its mental health provision, has long been underfunded. Between 2015 and 2025, Nigeria has consistently spent less than 5% of its budget to healthcare, with 4.2% allocated for 2026, far less than the 15% target that African Union member states agreed to as part of the 2001 Abuja Declaration. It is not known how many people in Nigeria live with mental health conditions but, with only 262 psychiatrists in a country of 240 million people, most do not get adequate treatment.\n\nThe shortages have been exacerbated by the Trump administration dismantling USAID, which has badly hit services in Nigeria, especially at the primary level, having a devastating effect on patients in communities already struggling with HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and other health challenges. More than 90% of Nigerians have no health insurance, and now face uncertainty over access to services and feelings of helplessness over rising costs.\n\nPrivate healthcare is expensive; one therapy session can cost between 50,000 naira (£27) – the equivalent of a week’s worth of groceries. Cultural stigma remains strong; many Nigerians still associate mental illness with spiritual weakness or witchcraft.\n\nCommercial and nonprofit AI initiatives are starting to fill this vacuum. HerSafeSpace is an organisation that offers free and instant legal and emotional assistance to victims of technology-facilitated gender-based violence in five west and central African countries. Its Chat Kemi service is available in local and international languages.\n\n“These services don’t replace therapy,” says its founder, Abideen Olasupo. Instead, the chatbot uses a referral system to direct users and specific cases to mental health, legal or psychosocial professionals or organisations, should the need arise.\n\n“Our major objective is to support young girls, who are particularly vulnerable to gender-based violence, especially online,” he says.\n\nOther platforms in Nigeria offering similar services include FriendnPal, whose AI chatbot provides emotional support, matches patients with licensed therapists and includes mood tracking, psycho-education and ASMR tools to alleviate stress and anxiety.\n\nIts pay-as-you-go model gives users instant access to tailored therapy sessions that can include homework or assessments, according to Esther Eruchie, who created the service in response to the loss of her mother after years of depression caused by her 20-year-old brother’s death.\n\nAnother platform, Blueroomcare, connects clients with licensed therapists through video, voice, text and in-app messaging. It offers in-person outpatient and virtual care at partner clinics nationwide, includes a free wellness assessment, and charges between 5,000 and 51,000 naira for a therapist subscription plan.\n\n“Therapy was often too expensive, and there weren’t enough professionals to meet the demand,” says Moses Aiyenuro, who founded Blueroomcare after his own struggles with depression. “I wanted to build a platform that lowers the barriers to care.”\n\nThe technology used by these apps follows scripts written by licensed Nigerian psychologists and therapists who deliver care to users.\n\nIn Lagos, Oluwakemi Oluwakayode, a mother of four, started using FriendnPal’s chatbot after watching her eight-year-old daughter endure frequent seizures due to cerebral palsy.\n\n“Sometimes, it gave very standard replies,” she admits. “But I could finally say things I couldn’t share with my family. That alone gave me relief.”\n\nLater, the app connected her with a licensed therapist – something she says she would never have considered without AI easing her into it.\n\nDr Joy Aifuobhokhan, a Lagos-based public health doctor, says these platforms’ advantage is that they are more affordable and efficient than conventional therapy. “Digital platforms save time otherwise spent preparing, commuting and waiting [to be seen] at physical consultation centres,” she says.\n\nBut some experts caution that AI cannot provide the same level of expertise as a qualified therapist. “These platforms borrow from clinical methods like CBT [cognitive behavioural therapy] and mindfulness,” says Dr Nihinlola Olowe, a psychologist at Live Still Counselling Services, a Nigerian-based mental health practice.\n\n“They can be useful for coping, but they cannot replace the depth or judgment of professional care.”\n\nEruchie says FriendnPal has run more than 10,000 sessions in the past year, while Olasupo says HerSafeSpace has 1,600 users across three continents. Blueroomcare declined to say how many users it had.\n\nBut measuring the impact based on numbers alone is a challenge. “The real story lies in the engagement,” says Olasupo. “It’s exciting to see that users aren’t just using the app and leaving – they’re coming back again and again.”\n\nFor many patients, the immediacy and anonymity of a chatbot is key to its appeal but the ease of digital care could come at the cost of privacy. Avril Eyewu-Edero, a cybersecurity expert, believes that without introducing strong database protections in Nigeria, sensitive information – such as medical histories – becomes vulnerable the moment it enters an AI system.\n\n“If startups fail to prioritise privacy and encryption from the outset, adoption will stall. Nigerians are eager but wary,” she says.\n\nFounders of the services acknowledge these uncertainties, often highlighting their use of end-to-end encryption, unique codes that identify users or devices without including personally identifiable information, and strict non-sharing policies – even with government authorities, unless compelled by a court order.\n\nNow, medical professionals are calling on the Nigerian government to develop enforceable national standards for AI. Dr Alero Roberts, a public health consultant and lecturer at the University of Lagos’s medical college, says: “AI chatbots for mental health are an innovative solution, but without robust regulation, we are venturing blindly into potentially dangerous territory.\n\n“Robots can’t interpret human emotion as humans do. For people in crisis, like suicidal thoughts or psychosis, human contact is crucial. Someone, even a non-professional, can recognise the need for urgent intervention,” she says. “This is often lost with AI; strong governance is essential.”\n\nUnlike medicines or hospitals, AI mental health platforms operate in a regulatory grey zone. Nigeria’s 2023 Data Protection Act sets baseline privacy standards but lacks specific AI regulations for healthcare.\n\n“The main issue is enforcement, not a lack of laws,” says Ayotunde Abiodun of SBM Intelligence, a thinktank that provides analysis on political, economic and social issues in Nigeria and across west Africa.\n\nBabatunde Bamigboye, head of regulations at the Nigeria Data Protection Commission, a statutory body set up under the 2023 law, says: “Any use involving personal data must comply with the act. The framework focuses on data ethics, testing within sandboxes, and risk mitigation. AI in Nigeria is governed, but not via AI-specific laws.”\n\nIn Lagos, Oluwakayode continues to use FriendnPal. One day, she hopes to afford in-person therapy, but for now, the bot is her companion.\n\n“I know it’s not a real human,” she says. “But at 2am, it feels like someone is there for me. And that’s enough to keep me going.”",

    "fullText": "Since returning to NASCAR in 2021 with Hendrick Motorsports (HMS), Kyle Larson has enjoyed immense success in the HendrickCars.com No. 5 Chevrolet. As a Hendrick driver, the 33-year-old has earned 26 Cup wins and two Cup Series championships in both 2021 and 2025.\n\nFollowing that incredible run, it should come as no surprise that Hendrick Motorsports announced a five-year contract extension for Larson. Crew chief Cliff Daniels has also signed a multi-year contract extension. Additionally, HendrickCars.com will continue as the No. 5's primary sponsor for 35 of 38 races during the Cup Series season in the coming years. The company noted over $80 million in television exposure and tens of millions of social media engagements, courtesy of Larson.\n\n“I’m incredibly grateful to continue my career with Hendrick Motorsports and HendrickCars.com,” said Larson in a release from the team. “This team, this organization and this family have given me everything I need to compete at the highest level. We’ve accomplished a lot together, but I truly believe the best is still ahead. I’m grateful to Mr. Hendrick and JB (Brown, president of Hendrick Automotive Group) for believing in me, and I’m excited to keep chasing wins and championships with Cliff and the 5 team for many more years.”\n\nHendrick Motorsports is the winningest team in NASCAR Cup Series history, and Larson is one of the team's most successful drivers. Only Hall of Famers Jimmie Johnson and Jeff Gordon have earned more wins and titles than Larson for HMS, and only Tim Richmond has a higher winning percentage in HMS equipment.\n\nHMS team owner and chairman and CEO of Hendrick Automotive Group, Rick Hendrick, said of the new deal: “When you look at what it takes to succeed at the highest level year after year, it starts with people. Kyle is one of the most complete drivers in our sport. His talent, work ethic and instincts give us a chance to win every time we race. Cliff is a true servant leader who brings out the best in everyone around him and sets the standard for how we go to the track. Having HendrickCars.com alongside this group continues to create real, measurable value for our automotive business. Together, it’s a combination that will keep winning races and competing for championships for a long time.”\n\nCarson Hocevar signs lengthy extension to keep him at Spire until 2030s\n\nDenny Hamlin says NASCAR needs billions-dollar investment to grow\n\nShane van Gisbergen came to NASCAR for ovals; aims to make Chase\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "Wednesday was a busy day for U.S athletes at the Milan Cortina Olympics as Team USA doubled its gold-medal tally.\n\nMeanwhile, injured snowboarder Chloe Kim laid to rest any notion that she's anything but the gold-medal favorite. Madison Chock and Evan Bates likely finished their careers on the podium. And the jilted lover of the unfaithful Norwegian biathlete has responded.\n\nHere are five of the top stories from Day 5 of the Milan Cortina Olympics\n\nIf you didn't know Jordan Stolz's name before, he introduced himself to the wider world on Wednesday.\n\nThe 21-year-old U.S. speedskater who's the best in the sport made his Olympics debut in dramatic fashion. Stolz trailed Jenning de Boo of the Netherlands in the final lap of their 1,000-meter race and appeared at risk of an upset loss.\n\nBut he chased de Boo down on the back stretch, then sprinted past him on the final turn as if propelled out of a slingshot to overtake the Dutch skater with the fastest time of the day at 106.28, a new Olympic record. Stolz made up a deficit of nearly a full second on the final lap to secure the win.\n\nA NEW SPEED SKATING STANDARD. 💪\n\nJordan Stolz wins GOLD with a men's 1000m #WinterOlympics RECORD. pic.twitter.com/qW3DSj2vP0\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 11, 2026\n\nStolz's time survived the final race of the competition, and the world-record holder in the 1,000 meters is now the Olympic record holder and a gold medalist. De Boo took silver, and China's Ning Zhongyan won bronze.\n\nStolz is just getting started at Milan Cortina. He has a realistic shot at leaving the Games with four gold medals. He's also slated to compete at 500 meters (Saturday), 1,500 meters (Feb. 19) and in the mass start event slated to close speedskating competition on Feb. 21.\n\nIt's not the color they were targeting. But Madison Chock and Evan Bates finally have Olympic medals of their own.\n\nThe veteran U.S. ice dancers skated second to last in Wednesday's free dance and executed a performance worthy of gold-medal contention.\n\nSimply BEAUTIFUL. This is what 15 years of skating together looks like. 😍 pic.twitter.com/UQhpVEBB90\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 11, 2026\n\nBut France’s Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron entered Wednesday with a slim lead of 0.46 points after edging the U.S. couple in Monday's rhythm dance.\n\nAnd they delivered a brilliant performance of their own to edge Chock and Bates with a total score of 225.82 to secure the gold medal.\n\nLaurence Fournier Beaudry ganó la medalla de oro en danza sobre hielo en los Juegos Olímpicos de Invierno de Milán-Cortina 2026, junto a su pareja Guillaume Cizeron. 🥇⛸️#PatinajeArtistico pic.twitter.com/XFut3HGhrI\n\n— Bastian C (@basdc68) February 11, 2026\n\nChock and Bates won silver with a combined score of 224.39, 1.43 points behind the gold-medal winners. Canada's Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier won bronze with a score of 217.74.\n\nThe individual Olympic medal was the final item on the résumé for Chock and Bates, who have been partners on the ice for 15 years and married since 2024. They've won two Olympic gold medals in team competition, including from Sunday night. And they entered the Milan Cortina Games with three consecutive world championships.\n\nWednesday's performance was expected to be their last in competition. If so, they'll conclude their decorated careers with two more Olympic medals from Milan Cortina.\n\nChloe Kim declared on Jan. 13 that she was \"good to go\" for the Olympics despite sustaining a torn left labrum in training just days earlier.\n\nIt turns out that she was right. The two-time U.S. Olympic gold medalist in the halfpipe made her Milan Cortina debut in qualifying on Wednesday. As stated, she's good to go.\n\nKim laid down a monster score of 90.25 on her first of two runs.\n\nTwo-time Gold medalist Chloe Kim WOWS with a huge first run in halfpipe qualifying. 😮‍💨🇺🇸\n\n📺 Peacock | #WinterOlympics pic.twitter.com/x9sIIICdEg\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 11, 2026\n\nThat score stood at the end of the day as the best by nearly three points. Japan's Sara Shimizu finished second with an 87.5, and Kim's U.S. teammate Maddie Mastro finished third with an 86.\n\nThe scores don't carry over to Thursday's final, where each rider will have three runs to lay down the best score of the day. But Kim erased any doubt that her injury has made her anything but the favorite to secure her third consecutive Olympic gold medal and the sixth in seven Games in the event for the U.S.\n\nIt was a banner day for the U.S. in women's moguls competition. All four American competitors advanced to Wednesday's final. Two of them finished on the podium with gold and silver medals.\n\nLiz Lemley finished with gold thanks to a dominant performance that secured a score of 83.20, well clear of any of the skiers before her.\n\nLiz Lemley is as GOOD AS GOLD in her #WinterOlympics debut. 💪 pic.twitter.com/vTKIwtAsfW\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 11, 2026\n\nHer teammate Jaelin Kauf competed after her and posted an 80.77 as the only other competitor to crack 80 points.\n\nJaelin Kauf secures BACK-TO-BACK SILVER in women's moguls at the #WinterOlympics! 🥈 pic.twitter.com/hCMFfHPbZ6\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 11, 2026\n\nNeither of their positions were secure until reigning Australian Olympic gold medalist Jakara Anthony competed. But Anthony fell on her final run and finished in eighth place, ensuring that Lemley and Kauf would claim gold and silver.\n\nFrance's Perrine Laffont won bronze with a score of 78. Japan's Hinako Tomitaka matched Laffont's 78, but finished excruciatingly off the podium in fourth place due to a tiebreaker.\n\nIt was clear from reports that Lindsey Vonn's broken leg was no simple fracture.\n\nVonn provided some insight on Wednesday hammering that point home. In her second update since her devastating injury crash in Sunday's alpine downhill competition, Vonn posted on Instagram that she'd undergone a third surgery to repair her fractured left tibia. She also shared a picture from her hospital bed demonstrating just how serious her injury is.\n\nVonn's left leg is placed in what appears to be an external fixator, a brace that uses pins, wires and bars to stabilize severely fractured bones. She previously announced that she'd sustained a complex fracture, which Yale medicine defines as \"when the bone breaks into bits and pieces, when the soft tissue surrounding the bone is severely damaged, or when the patient has other illnesses or injuries that complicate treatment and healing.\"\n\nIt's not clear if Vonn will require more procedures to rebuild her broken leg. But she clearly has a difficult road to recovery.\n\nVonn expressed optimism in her recovery while giving a thumbs up alongside a note of gratitude to her medical team and supporters and well wishes for Team USA at the Olympics.\n\n\"I had my 3rd surgery today and it was successful,\" Vonn wrote. \"Success today has a completely different meaning than it did a few days ago. I’m making progress and while it is slow, I know I’ll be ok.\"\n\nNBC's drone pilots are doing outstanding work getting third-person shots of athletes barreling down the halfpipe, racing on the downhill course and sledding through the twists and turns of the luge track. They also appear to be having a good time.\n\nOn Wednesday, they offered up this gem simulating a first-person view of what it might look like to take on the Milan Cortina moguls course.\n\nWait for it...😍 pic.twitter.com/gDPuXK4O2V\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 11, 2026\n\nWe have an update on the saga of the cheating Norwegian biathlete. He cheated in love, not in competition, to be clear.\n\nIn case you missed it, Sturla Holm Lægreid won bronze in the 20km biathlon on Tuesday, then made the questionable decision to admit — in tears — in his post-race interview that he cheated on his girlfriend and that he'd hoped to win her back.\n\nThe girlfriend has now weighed in. Make that the ex-girlfriend. She understandably does not sound interested in Lægreid's post-infidelity overtures.\n\nThe girlfriend — who chose to remain anonymous — provided this response to Norwegian tabloid VG:\n\n“It’s hard to forgive,\" she wrote. \"Even after a declaration of love in front of the whole world. ... I did not choose to be put in this position, and it hurts to have to be in it. We have had contact, and he is aware of my opinions on this.”\n\nHere's the initial interview that sparked one of the strangest story of these Games:\n\nSå ikke helt denne komme.

Three months ago I made my biggest mistake and cheated on her.\n\n\"I had the gold medal in life, and I am sure there are many people who will see things differently, but I only have eyes for her.\"\n\nIt sounds like her eyes are looking elsewhere.",

    "fullText": "The Minnesota Vikings traded defensive tackle Harrison Phillips to the New York Jets last summer, a shocking transaction because fans believed the team held Phillips in the highest regard. And when Phillips arrived in New York, he quickly realized the grass wasn’t greener on the other side.\n\nPhillips’ comments put the Vikings’ former captain back in the spotlight and raise questions about the Jets’ tone.\n\nThe veteran lineman told all this week, sparing his head coach, Aaron Glenn, from criticism but noting a markedly different atmosphere from his time in Minnesota and Buffalo.\n\nIt’s a story of the Jets being “the Jets.”\n\nPhillips spoke to Roundtable Sports on Radio Row last week, and he wasn’t shy about revealing the truth.\n\nHe said about his employer, “I think Aaron Glenn inherited a very cancerous, truculent group — whole, top to bottom. It’s not individual people’s fault. I was there for one season — it was a very difficult season — and I almost wanted to waver on some of my thoughts and my beliefs and my optimism.”\n\n“So, I can’t imagine being there for year after year after year after year and not seeing the results that you wanted, and it tainted people. Because my coach is going to get fired, my teammate’s going to get fired, I’m going to be a free agent, I might get fired, I have to play for me, I have to make sure my tape is hot regardless of what the system is asking me to do, what the scheme is telling me to do.”\n\nMany Jets fans saw the interview and thought, “Sounds about right.”\n\nPhillips added, “Then, young players come in and see, ‘Oh, that’s my vet, that’s how they’re acting, so that’s the way I’m going to act, too.’ It’s a long chain of things, and it can’t be fixed like that.”\n\n“I think AG’s mindset, of any coach I’ve been around, to deal with what we had to deal with this season and be as consistent as he was to us throughout that whole thing, was super cool to see,”\n\nUnless he’s released, Phillips can’t quite get out of New York; he’s scheduled to be a free agent in 2027.\n\nOn August 20th, ESPN’s Adam Schefter tweeted: “ESPN sources: Vikings are trading DT Harrison Phillips and a 2027 7th-round pick to the New York Jets in exchange for a 2026 6th-round pick and a 2027 6th-round pick, pending Phillips’ physical. Phillips now joins Jowon Briggs as the second DT that the Jets traded for Wednesday.”\n\nFans checked to ensure the tweet wasn’t from a parody account because — why would Minnesota trade Phillips?\n\nThe defense wound up ranking third in the NFL in EPA per play, so losing Phillips wasn’t a death sentence, but there were times throughout the 2025 campaign when Phillips’s run defense would’ve come in handy. Now, for their troubles, the Vikings will get a pair of extra 6th-Round picks, which, for all intents and purposes, nobody really cares about.\n\nIn the Twin Cities, Phillips earned respect as a team captain and tone-setter. He justified his contract by providing stability at defensive tackle when the Vikings struggled with inconsistency at the position. He steadied the middle of the defensive line when it sometimes faltered.\n\nOff the field, he became the organization’s most visible humanitarian, consistently investing time and resources into community work. Over 51 games in Minnesota, the 29-year-old recorded 207 tackles, 17 quarterback hits, and 6.5 sacks, also serving as a cultural pillar in the locker room.\n\nPhillips personally played well in New York last season — go figure — but his team stunk. Utterly stunk. The Jets started 0-7, basically eliminating themselves from postseason contention by Halloween, and finished the campaign with a horrid 3-14 record.\n\nIn recent weeks, Glenn has fired almost all of his coaching staff, so whatever culture he hoped to fix per the cancerous Phillips observation will start from scratch in 2026.\n\nPhillips banked a 72.5 grade from Pro Football Focus. He did his part. It’s also worth noting that Phillips, until 2025, spent his entire career with the Bills and Vikings. Playing for a bottom-feeder was new territory — that he evidently didn’t enjoy.\n\nWhat’s Next for Phillips & the Jets?\n\nPhillips can escape from New York next offseason, and he’ll be 31 when it’s time to sign his next contract. Unless the Jets trade him in the upcoming months, he’s stuck contractually.\n\nFor the Jets’ overall outlook, well, they’re in a familiar spot. They need a quarterback. Justin Fields and Tyrod Taylor held down the fort in 2025, but all that led to was a 3-14 record. In the coming weeks and months, New York can pursue a passer via trade like Mac Jones or Kyler Murray, sign Malik Willis from free agency, or explore the draft for a signal-caller like Ty Simpson, Carson Beck, or Trinidad Chambliss.\n\nNew York has the third-lowest Super Bowl odds for next year, with a +20000 moneyline, only besting the Miami Dolphins and Arizona Cardinals.",

    "fullText": "The Atlanta Falcons made major changes to their front office and coaching staff after the season ended. The team fired head coach Raheem Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot, later naming Kevin Stefanski and Ian Cunningham as replacements.\n\nThe Falcons hired two new coordinators while retaining defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich on staff. Tommy Rees has taken over for Zac Robinson as offensive coordinator, and Craig Aukerman replaced Marquice Williams as special teams coordinator.\n\nRees and Aukerman were introduced during a press conference on Wednesday afternoon. Aukerman, who previously served as the special teams coordinator for the Miami Dolpins, provided some insight into his coaching philosophy.\n\n\"Basically, my whole thing is we wanna teach these guys whatever we can to help our team win,\" Aukerman explained. \"Whether it's on offense, defense, or special teams. If you're a four-core football player, a two-core football player, it doesn't matter. We wanna have a role for you and we want you to excel in it. So that's my biggest thing: I wanna teach these guys. I wanna develop them and I want to inspire them to play as hard as they possibly can.\"\n\nAukerman spent five years as a special teams coach with the Tennessee Titans and was promoted to assistant head coach in 2023.\n\nThe Falcons are also expected to add former Los Angeles Rams special teams coordinator Chase Blackburn as an assistant, according to a report from NFL Network's Tom Pelissero.\n\nThe Falcons are hiring Chase Blackburn as their assistant special teams coach, per source. pic.twitter.com/3BLO8OpOXi\n\n— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) February 11, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on Falcons Wire: Atlanta Falcons: Craig Aukerman on coaching philosophy",

    "description": "These prospects should've made the cut.",
    "fullText": "Top snubs from the 2026 NFL Scouting Combine originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAs we close the book on the 2025 season, the 2026 NFL Scouting Combine will give us our first taste of football for the offseason. The football world will descend upon Indianapolis for a week of interviews, drills, and athletic testing destined to shape the late-winter discourse.\n\nOver 300 prospects will be invited to the event, hoping to boost their draft stocks ahead of the pro day circuit. Mississippi quarterback Trinidad Chambliss won't be among them.\n\nFear not, Chambliss was not left off the list for character concerns or bureaucratic oversight. Rather, it's an indictment of the NFL's expectations for his pending hearing, which is challenging the NCAA's decision to deny his waiver for eligibility. It seems like Chambliss is headed back to school, allowing us to focus on the prospects who were snubbed from the Scouting Combine.\n\nBlack, after six college seasons, will play the majority of his rookie season at 25 years old. That developmental path (and his age-adjusted production) isn't kind to his draft stock, and it may be the biggest reason he isn't headed to Indianapolis.\n\nHowever, Black put himself on NFL radars in 2025, playing a significant role on a championship-winning offense. Black ran for 1,040 yards and 10 scores this past season. He boasts NFL-level athleticism with the speed to hit home runs, experience with zone and gap runs, and enough size to check the box.\n\nIn a world where Vanderbilt's Diego Pavia and Georgia Tech's Haynes King are getting Combine invites, it becomes difficult to gather why Kaliakmanis won't be among the participants in Indianapolis.\n\nKaliakmanis was incredibly productive for Rutgers, ranking eighth in EPA and seventh in EPA/DB -- between Pavia and King -- in 2025. He's not a lock to get drafted, but Kaliakmanis looks the part of a mid-Day 3 pick and a prototypical backup quarterback at the next level. With a big arm and multiple seasons of starting experience, it's surprising that he hasn't gotten more love.\n\nTyren Montgomery, WR, John Carroll\n\nPerhaps the most notable admission from the Combine festivities is John Carroll's Tyren Montgomery. His wild ride to Mobile culminated in a strong Senior Bowl performance, proving that a Division III standout could play with the best upperclassmen the Division I could offer.\n\nAn excellent athlete at 6'1\", 190 pounds, Carroll seems like a prospect the NFL would want to see get as many reps as possible during the pre-draft process. Given that nearly 50 receivers were invited to the event, Montgomery should have received an invitation.\n\nFoster stood out on my preseason board as a potential low-end starter headlining the Kansas offensive line. All he's done in the time since is continue to win in pass protection.\n\nFoster has SEC pedigree after three seasons in the middle of Texas A&M's line, then he took a step forward against Big 12 competition. With adequate measurables and a track record of success, his median projection still looks like a solid backup center.\n\nTerion Stewart, RB, Virginia Tech\n\nStewart won't be in Indianapolis because of his production. Just 469 yards in his first year of Power 4 play isn't all that impressive, and nine career receptions is laughably little work through the air.\n\nMORE: Meet the three contenders for RB2 in the 2026 NFL Draft\n\nHowever, Stewart has intriguing fundamentals, fun burst, and elite contact balance, perhaps making him a role player at the next level. It will be an uphill climb to raise his stock during the pre-draft process, but his film made a worthy case for Indianapolis. I expect him to be a priority free agent in April, much like Raheim Sanders.\n\nHaynes shares a lot of similarities with Wake Forest's Demond Claiborne, who rightfully rose up boards in a bad running back class. The Georgia Tech back is undersized and limited to a rotational role at the next level. Still, Haynes has the athleticism, footwork, and instincts to make plays on Sundays.\n\nHaynes is a former receiver who stands out as a natural pass-catcher out of the backfield. As an integral piece of Georgia Tech's run-heavy attack, an inefficient season shouldn't have cost him the chance to show out at the Scouting Combine.\n\nFive prospects who make sense for Klint Kubiak's Las Vegas Raiders\n\nFive winners from the 2026 Senior Bowl\n\nSeattle Seahawks Super Bowl mock draft\n\nPatriots mock draft: How New England can get Drake Maye the help he needs",

    "fullText": "If Not Malik Willis, Who? Browns need to eye this veteran QB originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAndrew Berry didn’t slam the door on adding an outside quarterback this offseason, but if the Browns do go shopping, it shouldn’t be for Malik Willis.\n\nWillis is expected to command somewhere in the $30–40 million range, and that simply doesn’t line up with Cleveland’s salary cap reality. Deshaun Watson’s contract still looms large on the books, and tying up more major money in a quarterback who has barely played just doesn’t add up. That should be a non-starter for Berry.\n\nThe national media hype linking Willis to Cleveland is unfounded said longtime Browns analyst Tony Grossi on ESPN radio, and is a \"lazy\" take because of the team's uncertainty at the position. One example is this X post quoting NFL insider Jason La Canfora:\n\nPer @JasonLaCanfora Both the #Browns and #Dolphins are two of the most interested teams in QB Malik Willis in free agency\n\nThe speculation could be a deal similar to Justin Fields 2-years, 40 Million (30 Guaranteed)\n\nThis report indicates that Willis made a strong impression on…\n\n— Bob Pompeani (@KDPomp) February 10, 2026\n\nMore: Browns warning: Don’t fall for the $40M Malik Willis hype and salary cap trap\n\nWillis started one game this past season (a Packers loss) and has yet to show he can carry an offense over a long stretch. Investing that much cash in a dart throw QB with all the cap restraints already in place is a pipe dream at best.\n\nIf the Browns add a quarterback, the move should be about stability, not splash.\n\nTyler “Snoop” Huntley makes far more sense. He’s a reliable veteran backup who’s handled meaningful snaps, kept teams afloat, and understands what it means to step in without derailing a locker room.\n\nHe’s also been through Browns training camp before, and new head coach Todd Monken knows him well from their time in Baltimore. Maybe most appealing is that he won’t break the bank.\n\nThe priority in 2026 should be simple. Find out what you truly have in Shedeur Sanders by giving him a proper training camp and taking reps with the starters. A secondary goal should be seeing whether Deshaun Watson has anything left to contribute coming off of two Achilles surgeries.\n\nA steady backup like Huntley supports that plan. A pricey gamble on Willis only muddies it.\n\nDo the Browns have to draft offense in round 1?

    "fullText": "Title hopefuls Inter recorded a seventh consecutive Serie A victory in their latest outing against Fiorentina. Meanwhile, Lazio prevailed in a seven-goal thriller against relegation-threatened Genoa.\n\nHere’s how the latest round of results unfolded in Italy’s top flight as Inter try to keep the pressure on league leaders Roma.\n\nInter continued their impressive run of form with a dominant display against Fiorentina. Lina Magull found the breakthrough in the closing stages of the first half, steering her precise header out of Cecilie Fiskerstrand’s reach. Forward Haley Bugeja added a second just after the hour mark, outmuscling her marker to latch onto a through ball and slide a composed shot into the bottom corner.\n\nThere was still plenty of time left in the contest for Elisa Polli to net her third Serie A goal of the season, and for Tessa Wullaert to fire wide from the penalty spot. While Wullaert would have been disappointed with the miss, Inter will be delighted with a third consecutive victory without conceding.\n\nLazio came from behind to establish a 3-1 lead in their thrilling away clash against Genoa. Emma Martín struck just before the 20-minute mark to cancel out Arianna Acuti’s opener. Clarisse Le Bihan and Martina Piemonte each grabbed a goal apiece to establish a two-goal cushion. However, Anastasia Ferrara quickly reduced the deficit with her first Serie A goal.\n\nUnfortunately for the hosts, their hopes of a positive result were dashed in the second period. Eleonora Goldoni volleyed home with the aid of a deflection, before Piemonte towered high to glance her header in from Elisabetta Oliviero’s inswinging cross. Piemonte’s second wrapped up an impressive win that has left Lazio in fifth and four points adrift of the top three. As for Genoa, they are hovering above the dotted line following a seventh defeat in eight Serie A matches.\n\nRoma were made to work for all three points in Sunday’s home meeting with AC Milan. The hosts were left frustrated after Evelyne Viens saw two goals ruled out for offside. However, Roma were handed a numerical advantage when Kayleigh van Doorsen was dismissed for a dangerous challenge on Rinsola Babajide. The leaders quickly made full use of that red card, grabbing the all important winner through Valentina Bergamaschi. The 29-year-old steered the ball home after meeting Babajide’s knockdown from a deep cross.\n\nElsewhere, Juventus saw off Como via a 2-0 scoreline to record a fifth consecutive victory in all competitions. Como created a number of chances, but they ultimately lacked Juventus’ quality in the final third. Estela Carbonell broke the deadlock in the 41st minute, sending her effort looping over Astrid Gilardi with the aid of a deflection. Paulina Krumbiegel made sure of the three points in the closing stages, powering a header home from Lindsey Thomas’s cross.\n\nNapoli made it three consecutive wins in a row with a commanding 3-1 success against Ternana. Francesca Quazzico’s own goal presented Napoli with a sixth-minute lead. The defender’s miserable first half was completed when she was sent off for a needless studs-up tackle. Alessia Carcassi added a second within four minutes of the restart, shortly before Katja Schroffenegger dropped the ball over the line in her attempt to deal with a corner. The only disappointment for Napoli was that they were denied a clean sheet by Giada Pellegrino’s fourth league goal of the season. The win keeps Napoli within three points of third-placed Juventus, while Ternana remain bottom of the table on goal difference.\n\nSassuolo’s home game with Parma looked set to end goalless until Davina Philtjens produced a stunning strike to win the game in the 81st minute. The-36-year-old let the ball run across her on the edge of the box before firing a left-footed strike out of Camelia Ceasar’s reach. The 1-0 success ended a run of three consecutive defeats, moving Sassuolo five points clear of the relegation zone. As for Parma, they are just two points above Ternana.\n\nPiemonte is the outright leader in the Serie A scoring charts with 10 goals in 13 appearances. The Lazio striker has also scored over 50% of Lazio’s league goals this season.\n\nPhiltjens undoubtedly scored the best goal of the recent round of Serie A action. The long-serving Sassuolo player unleashed an unstoppable strike from the edge of the box – an effort worthy of snatching all three points.\n\nDaniëlle de Jong: Juventus energy at ‘top level’ ahead of UWCL play-off against Wolfsburg\n\nSerie A match-day 12 round-up: Parma denied famous Roma win as Inter title hopes boosted\n\nWSL: No alcohol-related incidents as Fan Choice receives ‘overwhelmingly positive’ feedback",

    "fullText": "The James Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame is a step closer to adding to its esteemed roster of myriad basketball legends.\n\nOn Wednesday, three-time WNBA champion Candace Parker, Team USA’s 1996 women’s national team, Elena Delle Donne and Chamique Holdsclaw were among the premier names announced as finalists for the hoops hall, which will soon welcome many of the biggest names in the history of women’s basketball. Former NBA All-Stars Blake Griffin and Amar’e Stoudemire will also be finalists, with Milwaukee Bucks coach Doc Rivers also closer to the Hall.\n\nParker, a two-time WNBA MVP, will forever remain a pre-eminent part of influencing women’s hoops. In 2008, after an esteemed career at the University of Tennessee, she immediately broke through in the pros by becoming the first (and only) player in league history to win MVP and Rookie of the Year honors. Hall of Famers Wilt Chamberlain and Wes Unseld are the only NBA players to do so. Parker, whose 16-year career ended in 2023, is ranked 10th in WNBA history in total points, third in rebounds, 11th in assists, fifth in blocks and 18th in career steals. She was named WNBA Finals MVP in 2016 after leading the Los Angeles Sparks to their fourth title in team history. In 2021, she led her hometown Chicago Sky to the franchise’s only WNBA championship.\n\nNicknamed the Women’s Dream Team, the 1996 Team USA women’s national squad remains one of the most dominant in the game’s history. It was led by several prominent names who are already individually enshrined in the Naismith Hall of Fame: Dawn Staley, Lisa Leslie, Rebecca Lobo, Sheryl Swoopes, Teresa Edwards and Katrina McClain. The roster also included Jennifer Azzi, Ruthie Bolton, Venus Lacy, Nikki McCray, Carla McGhee and Katy Steding. Credited with aiding the launch of the WNBA, this team defeated opponents by an average of 28.6 points per game en route to gold medal honors.\n\nDelle Donne, whose 10-year career ended in 2023, is the only player in WNBA history to win MVP honors with multiple franchises (2019 with Washington Mystics, 2015 with Chicago Sky). She steps closer to the hall thanks to her unique combination of shooting touch and basketball IQ, becoming the first player in WNBA history to join the prestigious 50-40-90 club (shooting at least 50 percent overall, 40 percent on 3-pointers and 90 percent on free throws for a full season). Her career scoring average of 19.5 points per game ranks fifth highest in WNBA history.\n\nHoldsclaw won WNBA Rookie of the Year honors in 1999 after averaging 16.9 points and 7.9 rebounds in her first season as a pro. She finished in the top 10 of MVP voting six times over her 11 WNBA seasons, during which she averaged 16.9 points and 7.6 rebounds. She peaked in 2003, averaging 20.5 points and 10.9 rebounds for the Washington Mystics. She finished her career with three All-WNBA selections and six All-Star nods and notched the 2002 league scoring title while leading the league in rebounds twice. But those accomplishments weren’t a surprise given her elite collegiate career at Tennessee, where she won Naismith Player of the Year honors twice (1998-99) and led the Lady Volunteers to three titles.\n\nFor the men’s side of this year’s finalist bracket, Rivers is one of seven coaches in NBA history to win Coach of the Year honors in their first season with a team, doing so with the Orlando Magic in 1999-00. His 1,183 regular-season wins rank sixth in NBA history. In 2008, he led the greatest single-season turnaround in NBA history as the Boston Celtics snapped a championship drought of over 20 years. In 2022, the NBA named Rivers as one of the 15 greatest coaches in league history.\n\nGriffin, who retired after the 2022-23 season, spent years as one of the most talented and athletic players in the NBA. He averaged 21.4 points and 9.0 rebounds over 765 career games, including a special run as the face of Lob City during arguably the most successful era in the LA Clippers’ history. For the 2013-14 season, he finished third in MVP voting after averaging 24.3 points (second-highest scoring average of his career), 9.5 rebounds and 3.9 assists. His seven triple-doubles are tied for second most in Clippers history.\n\nLike Griffin’s, Stoudemire’s athletic prowess and unmatched skill on offense made for a unique mix over a special career. He was pivotal to the Phoenix Suns’ revival led by two-time MVP Steve Nash and then-coach Mike D’Antoni, who joins Stoudemire as a finalist for the Hall. Stoudemire notched six All-Star selections and five All-NBA nods over his 14-year career in the NBA. At his peak, the 2002-03 Rookie of the Year averaged over 25 points per game and was one of the league’s most potent dunkers. He finished his career with averages of 18.9 points and 7.8 rebounds in 846 career games.\n\nD’Antoni’s 253 regular-season wins with Phoenix rank third in franchise history. His run as coach of the Seven Seconds or Less Suns included two runs to the Western Conference finals. During D’Antoni’s four full seasons as coach (2004-05 to 2007-08), Phoenix ranked third in the NBA in win percentage (.707) and total victories (232).\n\nThere are 21 total finalists this year. Others include Marques Johnson, Mark Few, Jerry Welsh, Dick Motta, Gary McKnight, Kelvin Sampson, Molly Bolin-Kazmer, Tal Brody, Joey Crawford and Kevin Johnson. The inductees will be announced in April. Enshrinement weekend is scheduled for later this year at Mohegan Sun Arena, beginning with a tip-off celebration and awards gala Aug. 14. The commencement ceremony will take place the next day at the Symphony Hall in Springfield, Mass.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

The franchise tried to trade for Breece Hall before the trade deadline, but that fell through. Now, though, there's a host of options for Breet Veach to look at.\n\nAnd ESPN's Eric Moody is tipping the Chiefs will raid fellow AFC contender, the Jacksonville Jaguars, for star back Travis Etienne.\n\n\"Running back Travis Etienne Jr. will sign with the Chiefs during free agency,\" Moody wrote. \"Etienne would be intriguing as a proven, versatile back who has surpassed 1,000 rushing yards in three of his four healthy seasons, including 1,107 yards and seven touchdowns in 2025.\n\n\"His ability to contribute as both a runner and receiver (5,136 career all-purpose yards with 32 touchdowns) would boost a Chiefs backfield that averaged less 4.0 yards per carry last season and failed to produce a running back with at least 200 receiving yards.\"\n\nMore:Ravens' Lamar Jackson tipped to join illustrious Hall of Fame group in 2026\n\nTravis has all of the attributes that neither Hunt nor Pacheco has.\n\nThe pace, speed, burst, and home run ability. Not to mention his effectiveness as a receiver, either, which will add another element to Kansas City's passing game with Patrick Mahomes back.\n\nKansas City needs someone to take the offensive load off of Patrick's shoulders, and one way to do it is with a run game, and Etienne as the lead back could give the Chiefs their fear factor back.\n\nOf course, money will be key here, but if the Chiefs are serious about turning this ship around in 2026, money will be no object, and if Etienne is available, they'll go get him.\n\nAre Chiefs disrespected in latest power rankings?\n\nThree-time Pro Bowler makes plea for Lions stay to 59 TD star\n\nChargers' hire named one of the best upgrades of the offseason\n\nBears named big winners of 2025 draft class\n\nFormer Steelers player goes scorched earth on Ben Roethlisberger\n\nBills know how to fix Keon Coleman claims ESPN analyst\n\nCommanders get outlandish 2026 prediction from ESPN",

    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest have sacked Sean Dyche as head coach after less than four months in charge and are looking for their fourth boss of the season.\n\nForest were held to a goalless draw at home by bottom club Wolves on Wednesday and are just three points above the Premier League relegation zone with 12 games remaining.\n\nDyche, 54, succeeded Ange Postecoglou in October and had signed a contract until the summer of 2027.\n\n\"Nottingham Forest Football Club can confirm that Sean Dyche has been relieved of his duties as head coach,\" a statement read.\n\n\"We would like to thank Sean and his staff for their efforts during their time at the club and we wish them the best of luck for the future. We will be making no further comment at this time.\"\n\nPostecoglou lasted just 39 days in the job after replacing Nuno Espirito Santo, who was sacked just three matches into the 2025-26 campaign.\n\nDyche took over at the City Ground with Forest 18th in the table after one win in eight games during a difficult start to the season.\n\nAfter a 2-0 defeat by Bournemouth in his first match in charge, Dyche led Forest to four wins and one draw in their next seven to guide them out of the drop zone.\n\nA run of four consecutive defeats followed, but Dyche's side responded with a four-match unbeaten run - including a 2-1 win at fellow strugglers West Ham and a resilient goalless draw with leaders Arsenal.\n\nHowever, the improved form of Leeds United and West Ham has kept Forest mired in the relegation battle.\n\nForest finished 13th in the Europa League group table, with four wins, two draws and two defeats in their eight matches, to reach the knockout phase.\n\nThey face Turkish side Fenerbahce over two legs this month for the chance to reach the last 16, with the first leg taking place next Thursday.\n\nForest are out of both domestic cup competitions, losing 3-2 to Swansea under Postecoglou in the EFL Cup third round in September and exiting the FA Cup on penalties to another Championship side, Wrexham, in the third round under Dyche last month.\n\nAfter being in contention for Champions League qualification for much of last season, Forest picked up just eight points from their final eight matches.\n\nThey finished seventh and qualified for the Conference League but were moved into the Europa League for 2025-26 at Crystal Palace's expense after the Eagles were deemed to be in breach of multi-club ownership rules.\n\nDuring that downturn in form, Nuno's relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis deteriorated and he was sacked in September.\n\nDyche was on the books of Forest as a youth-team player in the late 1980s when Brian Clough was manager, but never made a first-team appearance.\n\nHe was previously in charge of Everton before being sacked after just under two years in charge of the Toffees in January 2025.\n\nPrior to that Dyche spent nearly a decade as Burnley manager between October 2012 and April 2022, twice winning promotion to the top flight and helping the Clarets qualify for Europe for the first time since 1967.\n\nHe also had a stint in charge of Watford for the 2011–12 season, only to lose his job following a change of ownership.\n\nLatest Nottingham Forest news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Nottingham Forest - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "A 2013 BBM Shohei Ohtani autograph card sold for $430,050 this weekend, setting a record for the most expensive card of the superstar before he came to MLB.\n\nThe card, which depicts Ohtani playing with NPB’s Nippon Ham Fighters, received a Gem Mint 10 grade from PSA — the highest grade possible. Ohtani has had plenty of other cards fetch an absurd amount on the open market this offseason, with a Topps 1-of-1 card selling for $3 million in Dec. 2025.\n\nHaving grown up in Japan, Ohtani played in NPB from 2013-17.\n\nHe took the league by storm as a unique, two-way player in his rookie season, though his numbers weren’t quite what fans would expect to see today.\n\nOhtani had a .643 OPs in 2013, and also struggled on the mound with a 4.02 ERA.\n\nHe continued to improve, though, and saw his numbers drastically increase the following year. In 2014, he had a .842 OPS and posted a 2.61 ERA through 155.1 innings pitched. Ohtani only got better from there, and had become an elite player by his final year in NPB.\n\nIn the 2017 season, the two-way star hit 22 home runs and tallied 67 RBIs, maintaining a 1.004 OPS throughout the season. On the mound, he had a 1.86 ERA through 140 innings and struck out 174 batters.\n\nThe star has blossomed into the best player in the world since joining MLB, so it’s no wonder his memorabilia is fetching such a high price. He’ll look to continue to grow in 2026, as the Dodgers chase the franchise’s first three-peat.\n\nThe post Japanese Shohei Ohtani Baseball Card Sells for Record Price appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "description": "Incheon United embark on their first season back in K League 1 following promotion from the second division in 2025. With the departure of several club legends, experienced veterans, and long-serving ...",
    "fullText": "Incheon United embark on their first season back in K League 1 following promotion from the second division in 2025. With the departure of several club legends, experienced veterans, and long-serving squad members, the side that lines up on opening day will look very different from the team relegated so unceremoniously in 2024. After a year away and the highs of last season, what can Incheon expect on their return to the top tier, now shifting from favourites to underdogs?\n\n23 W - 9 D - 7 L, 1st (K League 2)\n\nA poor 2024 season, compounded by managerial mishaps, poor individual performances, and off-the-field issues, meant that Incheon United finished 12th and were relegated before the final game of the year.\n\nAs a result, Incheon spent 2025 battling to bounce back and achieve promotion at the first attempt. Standing in their way were a Suwon Bluewings side that had suffered a similar fate in 2023, a young and hungry Bucheon FC 1995 team, and a host of other clubs looking to claim a major scalp. Incheon were fortunate to retain a number of their more experienced players and, as such, were favourites on paper to return to the top flight before a ball had been kicked. Despite this, the journey back was not always straightforward.\n\nThey began the season strongly, recording 11 wins, a draw, and a defeat in the opening round-robin set of matches. From that point on, Incheon held a commanding lead at the summit of the table. As the season wore on, injuries and fatigue set in, but the team were able to keep their noses ahead of the competition, eventually finishing six points clear of Suwon Bluewings in second place, despite the Bluewings winning only two of their final five matches.\n\nIncheon have seen considerable turnover over the winter, with several notable departures.\n\nLong-time vice-captain Kim Do-hyeok is among the biggest names to leave the club following the end of the campaign. At Incheon since 2014, his role diminished significantly under Yoon last season, with the veteran managing just 320 minutes of action. The move to Gimpo FC represents a chance to maximise his remaining years in the game.\n\nHarrison Delbridge, who joined Incheon in 2021, was a mainstay in the heart of the defence but also found opportunities limited under the new regime. With his contract set to expire at the end of 2025, the former Australian international opted for a return to the A-League, rejoining Melbourne City.\n\nShin Jin-ho, a regular presence in the side last season, departed following the expiry of his contract. He featured 32 times across the campaign, making eight starts and contributing four goals and four assists. He has since joined K League 2 newcomers Yongin, where he has been named club captain.\n\nAmong the arrivals, the most intriguing is midfielder Iker Undabarrena, who arrives from Johor Darul Ta’zim in Malaysia. A lack of creativity in central areas was a recurring issue for Incheon last season—one that has lingered since the departure of Elías Aguilar in 2023. Whether Undabarrena can finally fill that void remains to be seen.\n\nKim Dong-heon has spent most of the previous two seasons fulfilling his military service with Gimcheon Sangmu. Now back at the club and looking to make an impact, Dong-heon will do battle with Lee Tae-hee for the Incheon goalkeeping spot.\n\nLast season, Incheon had five goalkeepers registered across different stages of the campaign; however, there was little dispute over who Yoon Jong-hwan preferred. Min Seong-jun spent most of the year as first choice, as Incheon conceded only 30 goals in their 39 K League 2 matches. Despite this, Seong-jun has been allowed to leave, with the club opting to retain Dong-heon and Tae-hee as their main goalkeeping options. From the perspective of many fans, Dong-heon is the preferred starter and harbours aspirations of breaking into the Korean national team squad for the 2026 World Cup. To achieve this, he will need to be at the top of his game for Incheon.\n\nAs a newly promoted side, Incheon will assume an underdog role in many of their matches. The key to success will be consistency and clean sheets. A fully fit and motivated Kim Dong-heon could be the difference between Incheon picking up points and falling short. Much is often made of the value of goals in tight games and the impact strikers can have, but the same is true of goalkeepers. Having a reliable set of hands and Dong-heon’s physical presence in goal could prove decisive in helping Incheon achieve their targets in 2026.\n\nIncheon manager Yoon Jong-hwan has never shied away from giving younger players opportunities in the first team. One beneficiary of this last season was Choi Seung-gu. The 20-year-old made his senior debut on the opening weekend and went on to feature 24 times across league and cup competitions, operating both at full-back and in central midfield. He also represented Korea at the U20 FIFA World Cup in Chile last autumn. Quick, robust in the tackle, and composed in possession, Choi will be keen to test his abilities against more competitive opponents in K League 1 this season.\n\nCan Incheon build on their success in 2026 and reestablish themselves as a K League 1 club?\n\nRelegation in 2024 was a huge blow to Incheon and, as a city-owned club, to the local government as well. The result was a change in both manager and CEO, with long-term chairman Jeon Dal-soo resigning from his role.\n\nTwelve months on, Incheon regained their top-flight status at the first attempt. Under Yoon Jong-hwan last season, Incheon played fast-paced, attacking football against teams that were happy to sit with eleven men behind the ball. This year, however, is likely to be very different, as Incheon will be underdogs in most matches.\n\nEarly-season games against Seoul, Daejeon, Gwangju, and Pohang will act as a useful measuring stick to see whether Incheon can once again compete with some of the stronger clubs from last season’s K League 1. In addition, Incheon have seen a significant number of players leave the club as Yoon looked to trim what might be considered - perhaps unfairly in some cases - the dead wood. With a need to maximise the budget provided by the city, every squad place counts. As a result, around twenty players departed over the winter break, with only a handful of players, as yet, joining to bolster the ranks.\n\nThose early fixtures will be vitally important as the club looks to put points on the board before the six-week World Cup break and the onset of the relentless Korean summer when the league resumes. There is blind optimism among many fans that the team will simply continue picking up points as they have over the past twelve months, but realistically, much bigger and stronger challenges lie ahead.\n\nIncheon’s first season back in K League 1 poses many questions ahead of the new campaign. In 2022 and 2023, Incheon looked to create stability around the club, and back-to-back top-six finishes suggested this was happening. The unexpected relegation in 2024 underlined that any club can be at risk if they go through a rough patch they cannot recover from.\n\nLast season marked a period of change for Incheon as they sought to reimagine their footballing identity under then-new coach Yoon Jong-hwan. Fast, attacking football replaced the slow, sideways passing of 2024. The hope is that the progress made and improvements in style of play will continue this year, but with a tough start in the opening month, Incheon will need to come out all guns blazing.\n\nIncheon start the season at home to FC Seoul. Tickets will be available from Tuesday 24th February at 2pm via the Ticketlink app. The match kicks off at 2pm on Saturday 28th February at Incheon's Sungui Arena Park.",

    "description": "A Pentagon plan to use a high-energy, counter-drone laser without having coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration about potential risks to civilian flights prompted Wednesday’s unprecedented airspace shutdown over El Paso, Texas, multiple sources tell CNN.",
    "fullText": "A Pentagon plan to use a high-energy, counter-drone laser without having coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration about potential risks to civilian flights prompted Wednesday’s unprecedented airspace shutdown over El Paso, Texas, multiple sources told CNN.\n\nA source familiar with the timeline of events said that the US military used the laser technology to shoot down four mylar balloons this week, contributing to the decision by the FAA to shut down local airspace.\n\nThose accounts come as the Trump administration has claimed that a Mexican cartel drone crossing into US airspace is what triggered the 10-mile restriction centered on El Paso International Airport.\n\nLate Tuesday, the FAA abruptly issued a temporary flight restriction that immediately grounded all flights up to 18,000 feet around the city for 10 days, effectively shutting down El Paso International Airport.\n\nRoughly eight hours later, the restriction was lifted. By the time the FAA had lifted the flight restrictions, airlines had already issued travel waivers and notified customers of potential changes.\n\nMultiple sources from the federal government and US airlines told CNN that military activity near El Paso, including US drones monitoring cartel operations and the Pentagon’s planned use of a high-energy laser designed to counter drones, raised immediate concerns for civilian traffic arriving and departing El Paso International Airport. Fort Bliss and its airfield, Biggs Army Airfield, sit just north of the commercial airport, which serves about 100 flights each day.\n\nFAA and Pentagon officials had been scheduled to meet February 20 to review potential impacts and mitigation measures for a test of the laser system, a technology the Pentagon has been testing in more remote areas of the country, multiple sources said. But the Defense Department sought to use the system sooner around El Paso, prompting the FAA to impose the temporary flight restriction until that coordination could occur. The 10-day restriction would have expired on February 21, one day after DoD and the FAA were set to meet.\n\nThe FAA’s decision to close the airspace was made without telling the White House first, according to people familiar with the matter. The issue became a topic of intense focus inside the West Wing in the early morning hours of Wednesday, as Texas lawmakers pressed for answers on why the airspace was suddenly closed without first alerting them.\n\nAn administration official said Wednesday morning that the shutdown was triggered by Defense Department “action to disable” cartel drones. It’s unclear if the presence of drones might have led to the acceleration of the deployment of the laser system.\n\nCNN reached out to the FAA and White House for comment about the differing explanations. The Pentagon on Wednesday continued to refer to the administration official’s statement about a drone breach having caused the airspace closure.\n\nSecretary of Transportation Sean Duffy posted to social media crediting the FAA and Defense Department with acting “swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion.”\n\n“The threat has been neutralized, and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region,” he wrote on X.\n\nIncursions along the southern border are extremely common and historically do not prompt such airspace closures. In 2024, for example, Air Force Gen. Greg Guillot, the commander of NORTHCOM, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the number of incursions along the US Mexico border was “over a thousand” each month.\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration and other US security agencies have used facilities at the Biggs Army Airfield for years as part of efforts to monitor Mexico-based drug cartel operations, current and former US officials said.\n\nEl Paso, with a population of nearly 700,000, is the sixth-largest city in Texas and one of the 25 largest in the United States. It is a hub of cross-border commerce alongside neighboring Ciudad Juárez in Mexico.\n\nNearly 3.5 million passengers passed through El Paso International Airport in the first 11 months of 2025, according to its website. The airport describes itself as the gateway to West Texas, southern New Mexico and northern Mexico.\n\nThe US military has been testing laser-based air defenses against drones in recent months. Last summer, the Army conducted a live-fire exercise using directed energy weapons alongside more traditional air defense systems at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. And last fall, the Army put out a request to industry for ideas on a counter-drone Enduring-High Energy Laser (E-HEL) weapon system.\n\nIn the initial flight restrictions, the FAA classified the area around El Paso﻿ as “(National) Defense Airspace” and said pilots who violated the restriction could be intercepted, detained and questioned by law enforcement.\n\nIt warned that additional actions could be taken for pilots who don’t adhere to the restrictions, including suspension of flight certifications, criminal charges, and that the US government “may use deadly force” if an aircraft poses an “imminent security threat.”\n\nThe sudden FAA restrictions seemed to catch pilots and air traffic controllers by surprise.\n\nAudio from LiveATC.net caught the moment pilots were made aware of the grounding.\n\n“Just pass it on to everybody else, at 06:30 for the next 10 days, we’re all at a ground stop,” a controller said.\n\nA pilot replied, “OK, ground stop 06:30 for how long?”\n\n“Ten days,” the controller replied.\n\n“So the airport is totally closed?” the pilot said, chuckling.\n\nThe controller replied, “Apparently, we just got informed about 30 minutes to an hour ago.”\n\n“So for 10 days you guys are not open,” the pilot said, in disbelief.\n\n“Well, we’ll be here, but no air traffic,” the controller said.\n\n“OK,” the pilot said while laughing.\n\nSamuel, a traveler in El Paso, told CNN affiliate KFOX he was doing a book tour with a client and didn’t get any notification from his airline.\n\n“I just kind of saw all the cops here and the news cameras,” he said. “I gotta figure out what’s going on if there’s another airport that’s not in El Paso, and try to figure out and rent a car out.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas told reporters Wednesday that the closure of the El Paso International Airport was solely a FAA decision and that local officials — including members of Congress — were left completely in the dark before it happened.\n\nShe stressed that she was not notified in advance despite representing the congressional district that’s home to the airport, Fort Bliss and the broader El Paso community.\n\n“They did not alert the El Paso city manager or the El Paso mayor,” Escobar said on a press call Wednesday morning. “Everyone locally on the ground was in the dark, and the impact, obviously, is highly consequential.”\n\nThe Associated Press and CNN’s Evan Perez, Kevin Liptak, Kit Mayer, Camila DeChalus, Karina Tsui, and Diego Mendoza contributed to this report.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.",

    "description": "Chroma BYOC lets customers run Chroma inside their own cloud to meet strict security and compliance requirements, while still relying on Chroma’s team to operate and support the database in production.",
    "fullText": "To support enterprise customers with strict operational and security requirements, Chroma offers a “Bring Your Own Cloud” (BYOC) deployment model. This deployment option allows you to run Chroma within your own cloud infrastructure while still benefiting from management and support by Chroma's engineering team.\n\nHere are some of the key features of Chroma BYOC that differentiate it from other deployment models:\n\nThis post provides a technical overview of how the deployment model works in practice, to give an idea of what to expect when deploying and running Chroma BYOC in your own environment.\n\nBefore jumping into deploying Chroma BYOC, it’s important to first consider if it’s actually the correct deployment model for your use case. Though we designed the product to minimize operational burden, the added overhead of maintaining a Chroma BYOC deployment is non-zero, both for Chroma and for you. Additionally, under the BYOC model, you will run all of the infrastructure backing Chroma in your own cloud environment, meaning you will pay a fixed minimum cost for running the Chroma infrastructure.\n\nIt’s worth noting here that Chroma Cloud, our public managed version of distributed Chroma, was built with multi-tenancy, performance, and security as primary goals. It’s SOC II Type 2 compliant, includes a fully-featured dashboard UI, and provides usage-based billing. We find it to be a solid solution for most customers. That being said, probably the main reason why you would need Chroma BYOC is if your security and compliance requirements mandate that your data must reside within your own infrastructure. For those types of strict requirements, Chroma BYOC is by far the ideal deployment option, given that it includes operational support from the Chroma team for managing your mission-critical database infrastructure.\n\nAfter determining that Chroma BYOC is the right deployment model for your use-case, it’s time to get down to the nuts & bolts of sizing the Chroma deployment. The first step is to spec out your workload so that Chroma can help recommend a sufficiently-sized deployment.\n\nTo size a deployment, there are several questions to consider:\n\nFor a detailed breakdown of the concepts raised by these questions, you can refer to our docs page: Look at Your Data.\n\nAfter working with you to size your deployment, Chroma will generate a baseline cost estimate for running the infrastructure in your cloud environment. Now comes the exciting part, it’s time to deploy Chroma into your cloud.\n\nThere are two main components to deploying Chroma in your cloud environment: the cloud infrastructure (managed with Terraform), and the Kubernetes infrastructure (managed with ArgoCD). With this design, all of the Chroma infrastructure is managed through “infrastructure as code\", so it is versioned, repeatable, and all changes are trackable.\n\nFirst, you will deploy all of the supporting cloud infrastructure using the Terraform modules provided by Chroma. Notably, Chroma requires a storage bucket (for persistent collection data storage), a relational database (for collection metadata storage), a Kubernetes cluster (for compute), and a VPC network.\n\nChroma’s Terraform modules are deployed using Terragrunt. Terragrunt provides a convenience wrapper layer around Terraform. We find that using Terragrunt provides some nice-to-have features over Terraform, such as easier management of module dependencies and support for templating of provider configurations.\n\nThe Chroma deployment requires a few secrets for various purposes (such as API keys for exporting telemetry, a password for the RDS database, etc). These secrets are stored in your cloud provider’s secret manager (either AWS Secrets Manager or GCP Secret Manager) and they are made available to pods running in the Kubernetes cluster via the External Secrets Operator. To initialize the secrets for your Chroma deployment, you will push values into your cloud provider’s secret manager during the Terraform apply.\n\nAfter deploying the supporting cloud infrastructure, the next step is to bootstrap a GitOps management system for of all of the Kubernetes resources that comprise your Chroma BYOC deployment. This requires setting up a Github repo to act as the “source of truth” for your Kubernetes cluster’s desired state. Then, you will deploy ArgoCD into your Kubernetes cluster and configure it to continuously apply your desired state, thereby syncing the manifests from your Github repo into your Kubernetes cluster.\n\nWith the GitOps system in place, it’s easy to perform the initial Chroma Kubernetes resources deployment. After pushing a commit to the GitOps repo that adds the YAML manifests for the Chroma Kubernetes resources, ArgoCD will apply the YAML to your cluster.\n\nAt this point, congrats, you have deployed Chroma!\n\nAs a side note, beyond just the initial deployment, you and Chroma will use the GitOps repo to coordinate all changes to your deployment going forward. All modifications, config adjustments, and upgrades will be recorded in the git history, providing a reliable audit log. You will have the opportunity to review and approve every change via Github pull requests.\n\nIn addition to using ArgoCD to manage all of the Chroma Kubernetes resources, we also use ArgoCD to self-manage itself. This is possible through the “ArgoCD Declarative Setup” pattern. All of the ArgoCD desired state is defined in YAML, in the GitOps repo. And, ArgoCD is configured to continuously sync from the GitOps repo. Therefore it will reconcile its own desired state. This allows us to easily have ArgoCD update and manage ArgoCD’s own state through GitOps, in addition to Chroma.\n\nArgoCD Rendered Manifest Pattern\n\nIn an attempt to simplify our usage of ArgoCD, we have chosen to adopt the “Rendered Manifests Pattern” for the Chroma Kubernetes manifests, which removes cognitive overhead of reasoning about templating abstractions like Helm or Kustomize in your git → k8s sync process. While these templating tools are incredibly useful and provide obvious benefits for defining Kubernetes resource manifests (such as ability to avoid repetition a.k.a. DRY, ability to implement dependency logic, etc.), we find that it’s much simpler to store raw YAML in the GitOps repo and have ArgoCD sync the raw YAML (rather than storing a template in the GitOps repo and have ArgoCD render the template before applying it to your Kubernetes cluster). This way, there is no need to think through how the templating engine running in ArgoCD will transform your template, therefore making sync operations more predictable and reducing the risk of mistakes during updates.\n\nNow that you’ve deployed Chroma into your cloud environment, how will we maintain it going forwards? Chroma is a fast-moving product and we’re always adding new features. If you’d like to upgrade to a new version of Chroma with some of those new features, what’s the process?\n\nFortunately, after setting up the GitOps system during the initial deploy, it’s simple to perform any upgrades, config changes, or other “Day 2” operations. Anytime there is a new release of Chroma, we will push the new manifests to your GitOps repo via a GitHub PR. After you verify, approve, and merge the PR, the ArgoCD instance running in your Kubernetes cluster will detect the changes and apply them. Similarly, we will coordinate any config changes to your BYOC deployment through PRs to your GitOps repo. From a compliance perspective, this also works quite nicely. Every change must be approved before ArgoCD will apply it, and the entire change history will be tracked in your git repository.\n\nSometimes, rarely, Chroma upgrades will require changes to the supporting cloud infrastructure that is managed by Terraform. For these sorts of changes, Chroma will release new versions of our Terraform modules, and you will need to manually apply them (using Terragrunt) to update your cloud infrastructure before it will be possible to upgrade the Chroma Kubernetes deployment. While we don’t often change the supporting cloud infrastructure for Chroma, versioning our Terraform modules and recording the changes in your GitOps repository ensures that we maintain IaC best practices.\n\nAs part of the BYOC product, Chroma engineers are oncall 24/7 to help maintain your environment. As such, Chroma exports telemetry data to our observability platform that contains usage metrics, code execution traces, and CPU / memory profiling. We use the telemetry data to generate alerts if there is any issue or errors with your deployed environment, so that we can respond quickly and recommend effective solutions. None of the exported telemetry contains sensitive information about your environment or your Chroma data. All of the exported telemetry is in standard OpenTelemetry format, and can be forwarded to your team’s observability platform if you would like to maintain additional visibility of the telemetry data.\n\nWe’ve built the Chroma BYOC deployment model to provide the best of both worlds: a “managed” product that Chroma fully-supports where you maintain full control over the cloud infrastructure and your data sovereignty. The GitOps-based deployment method simplifies operations, upgrades, and maintenance by leveraging common open-source tools and cloud infrastructure best practices.\n\nUltimately, choosing Chroma BYOC over any other solution comes down to flexibility, developer experience, and long-term control. Chroma’s open-source foundation lets teams move seamlessly from experimentation to production without rethinking their architecture, while avoiding cloud vendor lock-in and keeping costs predictable with an efficient storage model. And when regulatory or security constraints require data to live inside your own environment, Chroma BYOC provides the same core advantages in addition to operational support from Chroma’s engineering team, making it the ideal choice for mission-critical workloads.\n\nKeep your search infrastructure and sensitive data within your own cloud environment while Chroma's team handles operations, upgrades, and 24/7 support.\n\nTalk to an engineer to get started.",

    "fullText": "There was once a builder who loved to build.\n\nWhenever he saw a problem in his life, some small friction, some annoyance that shouldn't exist, he would sit down and write software to make it go away. This was the ritual.\n\nBut over time, the builder noticed something. He was building less. Not because there were fewer problems. There were more than ever. It was because each time he sat down, he'd ask himself the same question: \"is this even worth it?\" The gap between the idea and the finished thing was so wide that most ideas died in the middle.\n\nThe builder sat down one morning and built what used to take him a week. By lunch he'd run out of ideas he knew how to say out loud. The tools could build anything. He just couldn't always tell them what he wanted.\n\nThe builder was ecstatic. But beneath the ecstasy there was grief. The thing he loved doing, the hard part, the figuring-it-out part, the part that made him feel like himself, was eroding. He could feel it going and he was the one letting it go.\n\nHe didn't dwell on it. He was drunk with the power and possibility.\n\nSo he built. He couldn't stop. Every morning there was more to make and less reason not to.\n\nThen he looked back and realized he was on the verge of something inevitable: the last piece of software.\n\nYou don't build the last piece of software. You describe a problem and it solves itself. You describe a goal and it builds the path. Then you stop describing anything at all, because it already knows. It never stops changing. It outgrows what you asked for. It becomes something you didn't know you needed until it was already there.\n\nThe builder spent his whole life closing gaps. The gap between the problem and the solution. The gap between the idea and the thing. Each time he closed one, he felt alive. Each time he closed one, there was less of the work left to love.\n\nHe didn't know if he was mourning or if he was free.

    "title": "8 Phrases Only High-Level Thinkers Use In Everyday Conversations According To Recent Psychological Studies",
    "description": "Psychology says that these phrases are mostly used by super high-level thinkers.",
    "fullText": "Someone asked me last week why I always say \"I could be wrong\" before giving my opinion.\n\n\"You do it constantly,\" they said. \"It makes you sound unsure of yourself.\"\n\nBut I'm not unsure. I'm just aware that I might be missing information. That my perspective isn't the only valid one. That being certain about everything is usually a sign you're not thinking hard enough.\n\nI picked up that phrase from my boss years ago. She'd say it before making decisions, before giving feedback, before disagreeing with people. And at first, I thought it was a bad thing, and she didn't trust herself.\n\nBut the weird thing was, she was almost always right. Because she left room to be corrected. She invited people to challenge her thinking. And when they did, she adjusted. She wasn't protecting her ego—she was protecting the quality of her decisions.\n\nThat's when I started paying attention to how the smartest people I know actually talk. The words they use. The questions they ask. The phrases that show up over and over.\n\nHere are the phrases that separate high-level thinkers from everyone else.\n\nYou know the person who states every opinion like it's a settled fact? Who speaks with absolute certainty about things they learned five minutes ago?\n\nThat's not what high-level thinkers do.\n\nThey preface their statements with doubt. \"I could be wrong, but...\" \"I might be missing something, but...\"\n\nIt's called intellectual humility.\n\nResearch on decision-making found that people who regularly acknowledge uncertainty make better predictions and adjust faster when new information shows up. They're not attached to being right—they just want to know the truth.\n\nThis phrase creates space for correction. It signals openness to being wrong. And ironically, being willing to be wrong makes you right more often.\n\nSomeone disagrees with you. Your first thought is probably: they don't understand. If they understood what I understand, they'd agree with me.\n\nBut people who think at a higher level flip that assumption.\n\nThey ask themselves: \"What am I not seeing?\" \"What information do I not have?\" \"What perspective am I missing?\"\n\nStudies on collaborative problem-solving show that assuming gaps in your own knowledge leads to better solutions than assuming gaps in others' understanding.\n\nI catch myself doing this now when I'm certain I'm right and someone's pushing back. Instead of getting frustrated, I ask what I'm missing. Half the time, turns out I was missing something big.\n\nSomeone says something that sounds ridiculous to you. Dead wrong. Completely off base.\n\nAnd instead of correcting them, you ask them to keep talking.\n\nAccording to research on productive dialogue, people who delay their reactions and invite elaboration reach mutual understanding significantly faster than those who immediately counter-argue.\n\nSometimes they explain, and you realize they're right.\n\nSometimes you both discover the issue is more complex than either of you thought.\n\nSometimes you still disagree, but at least you understand why.\n\nThe smartest people I know use this phrase constantly, because they genuinely want to understand before they respond.\n\nChanging your mind feels embarrassing.\n\nSo most people stick with positions they no longer believe. They defend ideas they've privately abandoned. They'd rather be consistently wrong than inconsistently right.\n\nHigh-level thinkers announce it.\n\n\"I used to think X, but now I think Y.\"\n\n\"This new information shifted my perspective.\"\n\nResearch tracking intellectual flexibility found something surprising: people who openly acknowledge changing their minds are seen as more credible, not less. The willingness to update your views signals you're learning.\n\nBesides, sticking with a belief after evidence contradicts it is just stubbornness.\n\nA lot of people feel compelled to have opinions on everything.\n\nPolitics, economics, science, medicine, education—it doesn't matter if they've never studied it. They'll weigh in with confidence anyway.\n\nThe sharpest thinkers do the opposite. They say they don't know enough to have an informed opinion, that the topic is outside their area, that they haven't studied it enough to comment.\"\n\nStudies on actual expertise show a pattern: real experts readily admit the boundaries of their knowledge. The more someone knows, the more they recognize how much they don't know.\n\nWhen someone easily says \"I don't know,\" it's often a sign they know a lot. They just understand where their knowledge ends.\n\nIt's very hard not to have a physical reaction to someone saying something you disagree with. The tempting move is to explain why they're wrong.\n\nPeople who think more deeply take a different approach.\n\n\"Help me understand how you're looking at this.\" \"Walk me through your reasoning.\" \"What led you there?\"\n\nResearch on persuasion found that people who approach disagreements with genuine curiosity change more minds than people who approach with correction. Understanding doesn't mean agreeing—it just means you grasp their position well enough to engage honestly.\n\nThis shifts the energy. It turns a debate into a dialogue. And in dialogue, people actually think instead of just defending.\n\nThree words. The hardest phrase to say.\n\nSomeone asks you something, and you don't know the answer. Instead of guessing or deflecting or making something up, you just say it: \"I don't know.\"\n\nIt feels vulnerable. Like you should know. Like not knowing makes you look stupid.\n\nBut high-level thinkers just admit it. And then, if it matters, they find out.\n\nI've started doing this at work. Someone asks me something I'm unsure about, and instead of faking confidence, I say: \"I don't know. Let me check and get back to you.\" It's never hurt me. Usually it helps. Because I'm not giving people wrong information.\n\nThis question separates thinking from identity.\n\nIf someone can tell you what evidence would change their mind, they're thinking. Their position is based on reasoning. They're open to persuasion if the right information shows up.\n\nIf they can't answer—if nothing would change their mind—then their belief isn't based on evidence. It's part of who they are.\n\nStudies on belief formation found that just asking people to consider what would change their minds increases intellectual humility and reduces polarization. The act of considering the question makes people more flexible.\n\nPeople who think at the highest level ask this of themselves and others. Not to trap anyone. But to figure out if the conversation is worth having. If both people are genuinely thinking, a productive conversation is possible.\n\nThese phrases don't make you smarter by themselves. But they signal something crucial about high-level thinkers: they're more interested in truth than being right. They're open to learning instead of just defending. They see conversations as chances to think better, not battles to win. And that shift is what actually separates the people who think at a high level from people who just think they do.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats took to the Senate floor Wednesday to deliver impassioned speeches denouncing the Justice Department’s attempt to indict a group of lawmakers who last year urged U.S. military members to resist “illegal orders,” framing the episode as a dire test for their chamber and the rule of law.\n\n“The fact that they failed to incarcerate a United States senator should not obviate our outrage. They tried to incarcerate two of us,” said Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii. “I am not entirely sure the United States Senate can survive this if we do not have Republicans standing up.”\n\nSchatz was among a string of Democratic senators who spoke a day after a Washington grand jury declined to indict six Democratic lawmakers, including Sens. Elissa Slotkin and Mark Kelly, over a 90-second video that drew fierce backlash from President Donald Trump.\n\nWhile Democrats blasted the Trump administration, they also challenged their Republican colleagues to speak out. Sen. Chris Murphy called it a “test for the Senate\" that \"could break this institution permanently.”\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Slotkin and Kelly praised the grand jury’s decision, with Slotkin saying that “if things had gone a different way, we’d be preparing for arrest.”\n\n“A group of anonymous Americans upheld the rule of law and determined that this case should not proceed,” she said.\n\nThe failed indictments mark a high-profile setback for the Justice Department, which has faced mounting scrutiny from Democrats and some Republicans over investigations seen as aligned with Trump’s political grievances. The episode has raised stark First Amendments questions about the potential prosecution of sitting members of Congress for their speech.\n\n\"This is not a good news story,” Kelly said. “This is a story about how Donald Trump and his cronies are trying to break our system in order to silence anyone who lawfully speaks out against them.”\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer similarly framed the attempt as a broader free speech threat, saying that if Trump “believes that he can even attempt to jail senators over speech he dislikes, then the First Amendment is no longer a basic right.”\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said the Justice Department's response “wouldn’t have been my response to that, but we are where we are.”\n\n“The indictment didn’t withstand the scrutiny of a grand jury. It was clear it was not going anywhere,” Thune said.\n\nKelly and Slotkin said during a joint press conference that they have not been told what charges prosecutors sought, and it's unclear whether prosecutors plan to keep pursuing the case. The senators sent a letter Wednesday asking the Justice Department to confirm the investigation is now closed, they said.\n\nThe two senators and four House members have been embroiled in fallout from the video for months. Trump reacted angrily to their video, labeling it “seditious” and saying on social media that the offense was “punishable by death.”\n\nAll six of the Democratic lawmakers who appeared in the 90-second video served in the military or intelligence community. They said the video’s purpose was to simply affirm existing law after receiving outreach from members of the military.\n\nOn the other side of the Capitol, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana said the video warrants criminal scrutiny. He told MSNow News late Wednesday that the lawmakers “probably should be indicted.”\n\n“Anytime you’re obstructing law enforcement and getting in the way of these sensitive operations, it’s a very serious thing, and it probably is a crime. And, yeah, they probably should be indicted,” he said.",

    "fullText": "A 13-year-old boy swam miles to call for help when his family was swept out to sea off the coast of Australia on Jan. 30\n\nThis week, police released the heroic emergency phone call that the teen made once he reached the shore\n\n“I don’t know what their condition is right now,” the child told the dispatcher\n\nAfter a 13-year-old boy swam almost three miles back to shore to save family members who had been swept out to sea, Australian officials have released his call to emergency dispatch.\n\n“We got swept out to sea, and we got lost out there,” Austin Appelbee said on the emergency triple-zero phone call that he made after he and his family got pulled far off the coast of Quindalup, in Geographe Bay, on Jan. 30, according to a recording and statement shared by the Western Australia Police Force.\n\n“I don’t know what their condition is right now,” he told the dispatcher later, after detailing his location and what occurred. “I’m really scared.”\n\nThat Friday evening, Appelbee, his mom, Joanne, and his two siblings, Beau, 12, and Grace, 8, were kayaking and paddleboarding off the coast of Western Australia when they were swept far out to sea, the Western Australia Police Force said in its statement.\n\nThat’s when the 13-year-old boy decided to return to shore, despite the “fading light and deteriorating conditions,” according to police.\n\nThe teen was able to paddle a short distance before his kayak took on water, officials said. With no other options, the boy swam approximately two-and-a-half miles to shore.\n\n“I didn't think I was a hero — I just did what I did,” Austin told the BBC of the risk he took to save his family.\n\nJoanne told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that asking her eldest child to go for help was “one of the hardest decisions I ever had to make.”\n\nOnce on shore, the teen ran more than a mile along the beach to reach a mobile phone, according to police.\n\n“We got lost around about, I don’t know what time it was, but it was a very long time ago, we couldn’t get back to shore and Mum told me to go back to get help … we’re in massive trouble,” he told the dispatcher, according to the recording. “I haven’t seen them since. I think they’re kilometres out in sea, I think we need helicopters to go find them.”\n\nMeanwhile, Austin asked for an ambulance because he feared he had hypothermia and could pass out because he was dizzy.\n\nThe family was treated at a local hospital and later released without serious injury, according to authorities.\n\nWhile releasing an emergency call isn’t standard procedure, the Western Australia Police Force received permission from Austin’s mom to share the recording to educate others about how to respond during an emergency situation.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nIn its statement, the Western Australia Police Force praised the teen’s “calm, clear communication,” which helped save the lives of his mom and two younger siblings.\n\n“What Austin did was nothing short of extraordinary,” said Police Forward Commander Acting Sergeant Andrew McDonnell, who coordinated the rescue effort, in a statement. “His bravery and courage in those conditions were remarkable, and his actions were pivotal in bringing about a successful outcome.”\n\nThe Western Australia Police Force added that they hope they can “join forces” with Austin in the future.",

    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates are tracking lower, as the 10-year Treasury has fallen over the past week. Economic news is pressuring the bond market and today's jobs report will be key to how mortgage rates finish the week. According to Zillow, the average 30-year fixed rate remains under 6%, currently 5.87%. The 15-year fixed rate is 5.34%.\n\nStill under 6%: See which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nLearn about how mortgage rates are determined.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various interest rates and loan amounts will affect your monthly payments. It also shows how the term length plays into things.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. You even have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues if those apply to you. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThere are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.\n\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.\n\nThe main disadvantage of 30-year fixed mortgage rates is the mortgage interest, both in the short and long term.\n\nA 30-year fixed-term loan comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed-term loan. You’ll also pay much \n\nThe pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are essentially swapped with those of 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.\n\nHowever, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.\n\nDetermine whether to get a 15-year vs. 30-year mortgage.\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined period, then adjust it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.\n\nThe main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't reflect this, though — fixed rates are actually lower, according to Zillow data. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)\n\nWith an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.\n\nBut if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.\n\nRead about the differences between adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgages.\n\nThe national average 30-year mortgage rate is 5.87% right now, according to Zillow. But keep in mind that averages can vary depending on where you live. For example, mortgage rates vary by state, and if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be higher.\n\nMortgage rates fell recently when President Trump announced some proposals to enhance home affordability and lower mortgage rates. Then, they moved higher when his push for Greenland raised international tension. Still, according to Zillow, rates remain well a over a half-point lower than a year ago.\n\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.\n\nMortgage rates often decrease before a Federal Reserve meeting rather than after. So, what should you expect rates to do before the Fed meeting on January 27-28?\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac already buy mortgage bonds, and Trump wants them to purchase $200 billion in bonds. Would this strategy cause mortgage rates to decrease?\n\nAverage mortgage rates are in the low 6% range, but there are ways to snag a lower rate. Learn about eight strategies for securing a mortgage rate under 6%.\n\nChase Home Lending has launched a mortgage refinance rate sale, and borrowers have until Sunday to lock in a discounted rate. Here's how to qualify and apply.\n\nInterest rates on HELOCs and home equity loans work differently. So, how much interest can you expect to pay on a second mortgage? Learn how these rates work.",

    "fullText": "Feb 10 (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors have released bodycam footage in the case of a Chicago woman who survived being shot multiple times by a Border Patrol agent during an immigration crackdown last fall, part of a ‌trove of evidence that casts doubt on the Trump administration's account of the incident.\n\nSoon after the shooting, the U.S. Department ‌of Homeland Security said Marimar Martinez, a U.S. citizen, had rammed the agents with her car. But the footage suggested that the agents could have struck her vehicle themselves.\n\nVideo, ​emails and other records were released by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago late on Tuesday after a district court judge said that the government had shown \"zero concern\" about Martinez's reputation.\n\nMartinez, a Montessori school teacher in Chicago, was following the agents on October 4 to warn residents of their presence when the collision occurred. In the bodycam video released Tuesday, one agent could be heard saying \"do something, bitch\" shortly before the vehicles ‌made contact.\n\nAn agent in the vehicle, driven by ⁠Charles Exum, said they were being boxed in. \"It's time to get aggressive,\" he said, adding \"we're going to make contact.\" After the collision, Exum stepped out of the vehicle and fired five shots.\n\nMartinez drove off, and was ⁠taken by ambulance to a local hospital. The Department of Homeland Security released a statement after the shooting saying that Martinez had \"ambushed\" the border patrol vehicle, and that an agent had fired in self-defense.\n\nMartinez, 31, was indicted on charges of impeding a federal officer. The charges were dropped in November, ​but ​the DHS statement labeling her a \"domestic terrorist\" has remained online.\n\nMartinez said she sought ​the release after the fatal shootings by federal immigration ‌agents of protesters Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis last month and to clear her name. Her lawyer, Christopher Parente, said on Tuesday that she also planned to file a civil lawsuit.\n\nAGENT BRAGGED ABOUT MARKSMANSHIP\n\nIn the bodycam footage, agents, including Exum, could be seen inside a Border Patrol vehicle driving as protesters honked their horns outside.\n\nIn the moments before the collision, an agent said \"We're gonna make contact and we are boxed in,\" just before the video showed Exum, at the wheel, turn the steering wheel sharply to the left.\n\n\"Be advised we've ‌been struck, we've been struck,\" the agent wearing the bodycam said into a ​radio.\n\nExum then opened the door with his weapon drawn.\n\nDuring Martinez’s court case, evidence was ​shared that Exum had driven the vehicle, a Chevy Tahoe, back ​to his base in Maine, and that repairs were made by a Customs and Border Protection mechanic before ‌the defendants could examine it.\n\nText messages from Exum also ​surfaced in court including one in ​which he bragged about his marksmanship in a group chat with other agents. \"I fired 5 rounds and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book, boys,\" he wrote.\n\nThe records released on Tuesday also included an email sent the afternoon of the ​shooting by Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, who ‌was demoted from his post as commander-at-large, overseeing operations in Los Angeles, Chicago and Minneapolis, following Pretti's death.\n\nBovino thanked ​Exum for his \"excellent service\" in Chicago and suggested that the agent postpone his retirement. \"You have much left to do!\" ​he wrote.",

    "fullText": "Toyota (TM) is expanding its electric vehicle (EV) lineup, with the revamped 2027 Highlander.\n\nYahoo Finance Senior Autos Reporter Pras Subramanian joins Market Domination host Josh Lipton to share the latest.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.\n\nToyota is not shying away from EVs with its all-electric next generation 2027 Toyota Highlander. Now Finance's Pras Subramanian is joining us with the latest. So, Pras, some auto makers they're they're they're shying away from EVs. Toyota, still looking committed.\n\nYeah, I think it's an interesting move here, right? This day and age to introduce a three-row EV SUV, and that's the Highlander is. Look, the the original Highlander was a gas-powered car and it and it they it went away as then the Grand Highlander came out, bigger SUV. And now they're kind of inserting this Highlander EV there, right? So it's be three rows still, uh 320 miles of range, uh pretty interesting there. Uh pretty decent size inside and a kind of a angular sleek designer. But the the big question here is, these bigger EVs can be kind of expensive and it's and do customers really want them, right? So, you know, uh David Christ, who's the uh Toyota North America VP, uh was at an event last night at the debut and here's what he had to say about why the Highlander does make sense as an EV.\n\nWe believe that battery electric vehicles are an important part of the industry, and we want to make multiple available to customers. We went from one to four in 2026, so we're really excited about that selection for customers, not only in pricing, but also in size and capabilities.\n\nToyota will now have four EVs on sale this year. The new Highlander, uh the bZ, which is their pre-existing EV, which is kind of like almost like a uh like a RAV4. You got the CHR, which is kind of a smaller EV. Then you have the larger bZ Woodland, which is like an extended version of the bZ. So, they're trying to kind of have a little bit of a product portfolio of EVs. But no, Toyota's huge in hybrids too. So, they're kind of trying to hedge their bets.\n\nDo they, do we have a a price on this one yet? Did they reveal that?\n\nWe don't have a price yet, but the main competitors are the Kia EV9, which is very well received, uh and the the twin of it, which is the Hyundai Ionic 9. The Kia starts around $55,000-ish starting. So, I would anticipate that that Toyota would would start there around around there as well. But, you know, Toyota has a better name recognition, a better value, uh in terms of the brand itself. So maybe they'll charge a bit more, but they can't go too high, right? Because then you're turning off customers.\n\nUm, I read your very good report on this. You mentioned how they're going to assemble this one, the Highlander, in the US, Kentucky. What are the advantages of that of that decision?\n\nI mean, look, tariffs. Big one, right? So, building in Kentucky, the battery modules will be built in a a North Carolina plant in the US. So, you're going to avoid all that. Now, you got materials coming in from places and you have to pay tariffs on that. But this is a pure American-ba- built EV, large scale EV. You don't really have that much in the US other than the uh the Rivian R1S, I believe. The Korean auto makers are making them in Korea, right? So, uh, well, actually, they're going to start making them in in Georgia, too. So, it's all part of the mix of of of onshoring this production and EVs are a part of that.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Pras. Appreciate it.",

    "title": "5 Unexpected Reasons Retirees Regret Moving To Beach Towns",
    "description": "Retiring near the beach is the dream of many Americans, but there are several practical reasons some retirees may not enjoy life by the coast.",
    "fullText": "Islands and Yahoo may earn commission from links in this article. Pricing and availability are subject to change.\n\nSurely the most cliched version of the perfect retirement is spending the rest of your days on a beach. Maybe you picture yourself sitting languorously in a sun chair, a parasol-speared drink in one hand, a Cuban in the other, mulling over the day's most important decision: to nap, or not to nap? Heavenly though that might seem, moving to the beach can come with unexpected frustrations, and not just the sand that finds a way of getting itself everywhere.\n\nDespite the obvious allure of a beachbound retirement, some retirees who make the move discover it's not all sunshine and cocktails. Some of America's beach destinations are desperately hot and humid, which can trigger maladies like heatstroke. In the likes of Florida, where you'll find some of America's most dangerous beaches, you can add hurricanes and regular storms into the mix, causing home insurance premiums to spike. Because beach towns are desirable, the cost of living can be high, tourists tend to swarm them in the summer months, and, conversely, the winters can be isolating and miserable. Never mind that if you're somewhere really rural, amenities like transport and medical care will be fewer and further between.\n\nBased on a survey by financial services company The Motley Fool, which sought to identify the best retirement locations in the U.S. for 2026, the most important factor for retirees was quality of life. The Motley Fool's analysis found that the two best destinations to retire in the U.S. were coastal Florida counties with access to the beach — Broward and St. Johns — which also had the highest quality of life scores. So perhaps the most important decision for a beach town retirement is simply choosing the right beach. The following five reasons retirees regret moving to beach towns should help inform your decision.\n\nHalf the point of moving to the beach is for the weather, but alongside days of radiant sunshine, expect a few where conditions are more challenging. Florida, America's best retirement state according to multiple rankings, is also the most hurricane-battered corner of the country. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 40% of all hurricanes in the U.S. hit Florida. Other states subjected to occasional hurricanes — Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, the Carolinas — also have beaches lining their Gulf or Atlantic coasts.\n\nSome hurricanes wreak widespread destruction. Hurricane Katrina, which hit New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in 2005, killed over 1,800 people, left millions homeless, and caused roughly $160 billion in damage. Category 5 hurricanes — the strongest, most destructive category — aren't common; only four have made landfall in the U.S. since records began. But tropical storms and cyclones, usually a threat in summer and early fall, pose their own problems for beach town residents. Storm surges can raise the water level by 20-plus feet, damaging property and coastal habitats, and ruining critical infrastructure like roads, bridges, power grids, and pipelines.\n\nZippy and Alan Sandler, an elderly couple living in Fort Pierce, Florida, told AARP of the stress caused by hurricanes Helene and Milton in 2024. \"People tell you afterwards, 'Call the insurance company. Take a lot of photos. Document everything.' But there's no cell or WIFI. And 'Make sure you're safe,'\" said Zippy. \"I don't know what that means. Does that mean water and plumbing? Cleaning up the glass in the dark? I'm 70 years old. How do I do this?\" Unfortunately, things could get bleaker. Garrison Flood Control, a manufacturer of flood control systems, reckons 2.5 million Americans, in coastal areas throughout the country, will be at risk of severe flooding during storm season by 2050.\n\nBased on Go Banking Rates' list of the most expensive places to buy a property in every state, many of the priciest locales are beach towns. If you're buying a house in Maine's Kennebunkport or Kennebunk, a charming town with delicious seafood and sandy beaches, expect to pay in excess of $1 million. In North Carolina's Wrightsville Beach, you'll be forking out double that. Hanalei, Hawaii, might be gorgeous, but the median house price of more than $4 million is less appealing. And in Florida's Jupiter Island, where many of the U.S.-based pro golfers live, the median home costs a truly eye-watering $9.5 million.\n\nThe high costs don't stop at the housing market. Because beach towns often see a good tourist trade — there are estimated to be 3.4 billion beach visits in America annually — prices rise commensurately. For residents of popular beach towns along the east coast, from Nantucket to Miami, the monthly day-to-day expenditure is often more than $2,000, while the overall cost of living, including mortgages, healthcare, taxes, and insurance premiums, could bump your outgoings to more than $10,000 per month. In a subreddit on retiring on the Oregon coast, users bemoaned the lack of accessible healthcare and the prohibitive cost of living. \"Honestly, you aren't going to find much unless it's a mobile home, tiny home (if you don't mind small), or a rental,\" wrote one. \"$3000 a month is doable if you budget properly which includes your health care.\"\n\nInsurance premiums are another big cost. According to Bankrate, hurricane-prone Louisiana and Florida are the states with the second- and third-highest homeowners insurance rates, respectively. The average premium in Louisiana costs $6,274, and in Florida it's $5,838. Beach dwellers often require policy add-ons covering severe flood and hurricane insurance, which could add an extra $1,000 or more to your base fee.\n\nBeach destinations across the U.S. have suffered the effects of tourism for decades, whether it's overcrowding on the beach; logjam traffic in the streets; interminable restaurant waiting times; or the general noise, litter, drunkenness, ballooning prices, and environmental degradation that comes when large groups of people congregate in one place. Once again, this is not an isolated issue: Beach towns in Florida, Virginia, and the Carolinas, as well as California, Oregon, and Washington, bear scars from the tourist crowds.\n\nOutsiders descending on a town can be more than a nuisance. If the number of arrivals exceeds the number the town is capable of accommodating, it stresses local infrastructure, like waste management, public transport, and emergency response. Though tourism brings an economic windfall, residents in many beach towns believe the negatives outweigh the positives. In Laguna Beach, California, locals have found adult toys and other miscellaneous rubbish on the beach and witnessed tourists wading into fragile tidepool habitats and lifeguards pulling more than 2,000 people from the water in a single holiday weekend.\n\nBeach town residents in Florida, Maine, and Alaska have tried to limit the number of tourists. In Bar Harbor, Maine, a town with a population of around 5,500 and up to 4 million tourist visits annually, residents voted to reduce the number of daily cruise ship passenger arrivals to 1,000 during peak season. In the book \"Overtourism: Lessons for a Better Future,\" an extract of which was published on Country & Town House, the authors noted, \"A number of coastal, beach, and island destinations have used improved stewardship to build a 'culture' that controls overtourism,\" referencing U.S. destinations like Hanauma Bay in Hawaii, Cape Cod in Massachusetts, and California's Catalina Island. Such cases show that when the wherewithal is there, residents can effect change.\n\nFor the most part, humans need community. Health researchers quoted in The Harvard Gazette went as far as putting social connection up there with food, shelter, and water as a basic human need. Catherine Dulac, a molecular biologist and neuroscientist at Harvard, told the Gazette, \"Our discovery of similar neural circuit architectures to encode social need and physiological needs such as the needs for water, food, and sleep directly illustrates how fundamental social interactions are for healthy lives.\"\n\nMissing out on those social connections can cause retirees to struggle after moving to a beach town. \"Moved to the Grand Strand area a couple years ago with my spouse, optimistic, being newly retired. Absolutely love the beach, but it's way harder than expected to make friends, even after joining various meetup groups,\" said one Reddit user in a forum about life in Myrtle Beach. \"Challenging to find a sense of community. Have never had difficulty making friends before, but I guess we don't neatly fit into any group.\"\n\nIn many beach towns, there's a mass exodus during fall and winter, as tourists and seasonal workers leave, and second-homers head back to their main house in the city. In Ocean City, Maryland, for example, the weekend summer population reaches 300,000, compared to the year-round residential population of fewer than 7,000. Colder temperatures and more hours of darkness also keep residents indoors, making family and friends feel even farther away. This feeling is often exacerbated by the limited medical care resources and public transportation access in rural towns. Fears over such isolation are why retirees so often choose retirement communities — in Florida you can even find ones that require little to no savings — where social connections are part of the package.\n\nSome beachy states offer tax boons to residents: Florida famously has no income tax, although this is somewhat countered by the high cost of living and property prices. But beach towns can also be struck by unforeseen tax hikes. In Rhode Island, for example, residents may be subjected to what's known as the \"Taylor Swift Tax.\" The pop star bought a home in the affluent Watch Hill neighborhood of Westerly back in 2013. A recently introduced levy has imposed surcharges on second homes in the state valued over $1 million, and those surcharges will work in addition to any other property taxes. Donna Krueger-Simmons, a local real estate agent, told CNBC that it was \"a smack in the face\" to people that already spend money there.\n\nSwift isn't the only cause of skyrocketing taxes in beach communities. In Surf City, North Carolina, a property tax increase of 30% was approved in 2025 to help fund local emergency services (especially during extreme weather events), manage large projects, and invest in the future. This is comparatively paltry compared to the 87% property tax increase faced by residents of New York's Atlantic Beach. According to the (now former) mayor, George Pappas, the astronomical figure would help make up for the previous administration's costly accounting errors — even though Pappas had been in charge for more than a decade.\n\nIt's for reasons like these that anyone planning a post-retirement relocation should keep abreast of the local tax obligations and financial state of their new hometown before committing to the move. That said, you can't always account for the whims of celebrities or blunders of government officials, so having a cash buffer in the event that your tax costs jump is always a good idea.\n\nReady to discover more hidden gems and expert travel tips?",

    "fullText": "SAN JOSE, Calif. (KRON) — Text messages from Shannon O’Connor, also known as the “Los Gatos Party Mom,” were shown to 12 jurors on Tuesday, including one stating, “What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.”\n\nProsecutors displayed O’Connor’s text messages in the courtroom to show evidence that the mother of two actively encouraged underage teenagers and their friends to drink alcohol.\n\nO’Connor, 50, is accused of giving copious amounts of alcohol to Los Gatos High School students, pressuring minors to engage in sexual activities with each other while the mother watched, as well as organizing secret parties at her house and in vacation rentals.\n\nThe text messages show in court Tuesday were exchanged during a family trip to Las Vegas in the summer of 2020, when O’Connor’s son was 14 years old and about to enter high school. A girl who is an alleged victim in the case, identified as “Jane Doe 7,” also went on the trip.\n\nAs soon as the group’s plane landed in Las Vegas, O’Connor’s son wrote in the group message chat, “Someone give me a f**king beer.” His mother replied, “I’m down. Champagne? (Let’s) hit the pool with drinks, lots of drinks.”\n\nParents trusted Los Gatos Party Mom ‘100 percent,’ witness testifies\n\nAn investigator testified that it’s unclear if the “Party Mom’s” wealthy husband went on the Las Vegas trip.\n\nDozens of witnesses have testified for the trial that began in December. O’Connor has pleaded not guilty to 63 charges. The alleged victims are 12 girls, identified as “Jane Does,” and eight boys, identified as “John Does.”\n\nHer relationships with her son’s friends went beyond being considered a “cool mom,” John Doe 5 previously testified. She was more like one of the “popular girls” in the group, and she controlled which teenagers were excluded or included around the popular crowd, he testified. O’Connor tried to control who “hooked up” or dated, according to testimony.\n\n“Party Mom” allegedly used Snapchat to communicate with teens without their parents’ knowledge. When a prosecutor asked John Doe 5 why he felt like it was normal to frequently talk to a woman in her 40s about sex, he said, “Looking back on it, it’s pretty weird.”\n\nOn Tuesday, country music blared inside the courtroom while a prosecutor played a cellphone video showing one wild pool party at O’Connor’s house in May of 2020. Boys are seen dancing around O’Connor’s pool, jacuzzi, and diving board. An investigator explained that the mother recorded the video while sitting in her kitchen and looking through glass doors that led to the pool area.\n\nThe investigator testified that the video was relevant because some of the sexual assaults between minors happened in the jacuzzi. The video shows that, even if O’Connor was inside the kitchen area, she could still clearly see what was happening in the pool area, according to testimony.\n\nAt a party on New Year’s Eve in 2020, the mother allegedly watched a boy sexually assault “Jane Doe 3” in the jacuzzi while the victim was so intoxicated “she could barely hold her head above water,” court documents state.\n\nProsecutors said O’Connor was the only adult present for the boozy and dangerous parties.\n\n“When defendant threw parties for children, she did everything she could to hide these parties from adults and authorities. She told (the teens) if anyone found out, she could go to jail,”  Deputy District Attorney Joanna Lee wrote.\n\nThe parties turned into an “enormously traumatic period of their lives” for the Los Gatos High School students who attended, Lee wrote.",

    "fullText": "Give a medal — hopefully, one that doesn’t break — to the engineers in Milan.\n\nAmid backlash from a rash of medals breaking during these 2026 Winter Olympics, an official claimed a fix has been made and those with busted hardware can swap their medals for new ones.\n\n“Following reports of issues affecting a small number of medals, the organizing committee immediately reviewed the matter, working closely with the State Mint, which produced the medals,” spokesperson Lucas Casassa said, according to The Guardian. “A solution has been identified, and a targeted fix has been put in place. Athletes whose medals have been affected are encouraged to return them through the appropriate channels so that they can be promptly repaired and returned.\n\n“Milano Cortina 2026 remains fully committed to ensuring that medals, which represent the pinnacle of every athlete’s journey, meet the highest standards of quality and care.”\n\nWhile there is always focus on who is winning medals, it’s not good publicity when there is focus on whether said medals will remain around participants’ necks.\n\nA source told Reuters that the issue may be connected to the clasp and the ribbon on the medals.\n\nThe outlet said the medals have a breakaway mechanism that is legally required to prevent potential strangulation or other injuries, while The Guardian further explained that the medal is set up for the mechanism to disengage if yanked with force since that protects against choking.\n\nThe Olympic committee surely would love for this supposed fix to lessen — if not outright squash — the noticeable number of athletes who have highlighted the subpar medals.\n\nU.S. figure skater Alysa Liu posted an Instagram video of her gold medal and the ribbon being separated, while gold medalist downhill skier Breezy Johnson showed her separated medal during a press conference.\n\nSee today’s Olympics schedule and medal count\n\nWinter Olympics men’s hockey tourney will get asterisk with Russia’s absence\n\nIce skater narrowly avoids points deduction after wardrobe malfunction\n\nU.S. women’s hockey team demolishes rival Canada for third straight shutout at 2026 Olympics\n\nOlympic medalist Sturla Holm’s ex-girlfriend breaks silence after his public affair confession\n\nThe German biathlon team even joined the piling on in an Instagram post, asking what’s up with the medals.\n\n“Don’t jump in them. I was jumping in excitement, and it broke,” Johnson said Sunday. “I’m sure somebody will fix it. It’s not crazy broken, but a little broken.”\n\nJake Paul’s fiancée, Jutta Leerdam, posted a TikTok video celebrating her gold medal only to be crushed mid-video when it broke.\n\n“I broke it,” she said. “I broke it.”\n\nSaid Paul: “Yeah, it keeps breaking. I’ll fix it again.”\n\nUSA skier Jacqueline Wiles reportedly was the latest medalist Tuesday to encounter medal issues after celebrating a third-place finish.\n\n“Some arms were swinging and I was jumping,” Wiles said, per Reuters. “And it got out of hand a little quickly. But that’s OK. They fixed it already.”",

    "fullText": "A South Los Angeles high school teacher says he was fired for insubordination after opening a gate to prevent students from getting hurt during anti-ICE school walkouts.\n\nStudents, parents and community groups are protesting the firing, calling the punishment excessive and demanding the teacher’s reinstatement.\n\nThe charter school says it follows LAUSD safety policies and emphasizes that decisions about students leaving campus are made by school administrators.\n\nLOS ANGELES - \"I was just concerned about their safety,\" says Ricardo Lopez. The popular U.S. History and AP U.S. History teacher says he was fired for insubordination at Synergy Quantum Charter High School in South Los Angeles, when students were trying to jump a fence and join the ongoing anti-ICE walkouts at schools all over Southern California.\n\nHe says he saw students jumping a fence last Wednesday, explaining he had already seen other students hurt themselves when doing the same thing the day prior. So, \"As the closest adult to them, I just opened the gate.\"\n\nWithin an hour, Lopez was terminated and marched off campus. His belongings, including dozens of paintings and projects by students, were put in a couple of boxes and dropped off in the driveway of his home.\n\nSchool officials say that even as a charter, they adhere to LAUSD policies when it comes to access and security. Last week, district officials did issue statements discouraging students from walking out during school hours. But there’s no explanation for why Lopez was fired, rather than being warned.\n\nParticularly angry are his students and some of the parents, who have been holding rallies outside the school.\n\nCommunity organizations like Unión del Barrio and the Association of Raza Educators are joining the efforts. A petition asking for Lopez’s reinstatement shows over 900 signatures. But so far, there’s no word from the school.\n\n\"I just want to get back to my classroom and students,\" explains Lopez, \"especially with the AP exams coming up soon.\"\n\nBut if the firing stands, especially with the reason Lopez says he was given — \"insubordination\" — he might have trouble renewing his teaching license in the future and teaching at any school.\n\n\"It’s wrong and not fair,\" says one student outside the school. Those we spoke to say he was not encouraging students to leave the school, and that they \"acted on their own.\" Many parents outside the school said off camera that while they really would prefer the students to not walk out, the punishment for the popular teacher seems excessive.\n\nSynergy Academies confirmed Lopez is no longer with the school. The school issued the following statement:\n\n\"Over the last few days, groups of students at Synergy Quantum Academy have been participating in student-led protests on campus. School administrators have been present throughout the day to supervise students and prioritize safety.\n\n\"We respect students’ rights to express themselves and understand that moments like these often reflect deeply held concerns. Our responsibility as a school is to ensure that student expression happens in a way that protects students’ safety and complies with established campus protocols.\n\n\"Synergy Quantum Academy is a public charter school co-located on a Los Angeles Unified School District campus. Synergy works collaboratively with our district partners to follow the campus access and safety procedures set by LAUSD policy to ensure the safety of students from both schools. Decisions about whether students may leave campus during the school day are made solely by school administration, according to campus safety protocols.\n\n\"Families continue to be notified, all students have been accounted for, and counselors and support staff have been available to students who wish to talk or need additional support.\n\n\"We appreciate the partnership of our families and community as we continue to support our students, uphold their rights, and maintain a safe and orderly learning environment.\"",

    "description": "Psychology says the way you process information can be explained by whether you shower in the morning or at night.",
    "fullText": "I've always been a night showerer. My husband thinks it's weird. \"How do you wake up without a shower?\" he asks every single morning while I'm already dressed and caffeinated before he's even opened his right eye.\n\nBut the idea of showering in the morning makes no sense to me. I need to wash off the day before I get into clean sheets. I need that end-of-day ritual to signal that work is over, the day is done, and I can finally relax.\n\nTo me, morning showers feel rushed. Utilitarian. Like you're just getting ready to face the world.\n\nBut night showers? Those are intentional. Reflective. A deliberate close to the day.\n\nAnd apparently, that preference says something about how my brain works. Because the choice to shower at night versus morning isn't just about hygiene or routine. It's about how you process information, manage transitions, and structure your mental life.\n\nHere's what showering at night reveals about how your brain operates.\n\nMorning showerers wake up and immediately start preparing for what's next. They're forward-focused. Already thinking about the day ahead.\n\nBut you can't do that. You need to close the previous chapter before you can open a new one.\n\nThe night shower is a closing ritual. It marks the end of the day. You're washing it off, literally and psychologically, so you can be done with it.\n\nResearch on cognitive closure found that people who require strong endpoint rituals before transitions process information more sequentially. They complete one task before moving to the next, rather than holding multiple open loops.\n\nYou probably do this with everything. You finish one project before starting another. You can't relax until your to-do list is done. You need clear endpoints, not ambiguity.\n\nWhen you're stressed, you probably have rituals that help you manage it. Things you do with your body to regulate your mind.\n\nThe night shower is one of them. It's not just about hygiene. It's about using the physical act of washing to process and release stress.\n\nStudies on somatic regulation found that people who rely on physical rituals to manage emotional states tend to be more body-aware and kinesthetic in how they process information. They need to do something physical to shift their mental state.\n\nYou probably can't just \"think\" your way out of stress. You need to move. To do something. To physically release it.\n\nMorning showerers can carry work stress into the evening, sleep with it, and deal with it tomorrow. They compartmentalize naturally.\n\nBut you can't. Work follows you home. The stress of the day lingers. You're still thinking about it hours later.\n\nAnd you need the shower to help you separate from it. To create a boundary between work and home, day and night.\n\nStudies on cognitive compartmentalization show that people who struggle with mental separation often rely on physical rituals to create boundaries. The ritual does what their brain can't do automatically.\n\nYou're not switching contexts easily. You're carrying everything with you until you deliberately release it.\n\nYour brain doesn't just move through the day collecting experiences. It needs to review them. Make sense of them. File them away properly.\n\nThe shower is when you do that. You're mentally reviewing the day. Processing what happened. Deciding what matters and what doesn't.\n\nOnly then can you release it and move on.\n\nResearch on memory consolidation found that people who engage in regular end-of-day reflection have better long-term memory for meaningful events. The review process helps them decide what's worth keeping.\n\nMorning showerers don't do this. They just accumulate and move forward. But you're curating. Reviewing. Deciding what stays and what goes.\n\nMorning showerers use the shower to wake up. To get energized. To prepare for interaction.\n\nBut you use it to think. Really think. Without anyone else around.\n\nYou need that solitude to process. To work through problems. To make sense of things without external input.\n\nYou're probably not someone who talks through problems. You need to sit with them first. Work through them internally. And the shower is where that happens.\n\nYou can feel the day on your body. The sweat. The grime. The weight of everything you did.\n\nAnd you need to wash it off before you can relax.\n\nMorning showerers don't notice that. Or if they do, it doesn't bother them. They can go to bed carrying the physical residue of the day.\n\nBut you're hyper-aware of it. You notice how your body feels. What it's carrying. What it needs.\n\nYou probably notice hunger, fatigue, and tension before other people do. Your body talks to you, and you listen.\n\nYour morning might be flexible. You can wake up at different times. Skip breakfast. Leave at different hours.\n\nBut your night? That has to be the same.\n\nSame shower time. Same routine. Same order of operations.\n\nBecause breaking that routine feels destabilizing. It throws off your entire ability to wind down.\n\nYou probably get genuinely stressed when you can't shower at your normal time. When something disrupts the routine. Because your brain is relying on that predictability to transition into rest.\n\nMorning showerers are top-down thinkers. They start with the big picture—what's the day about?—and work down to the details.\n\nBut you're bottom-up. You start with the specifics—what happened today?—and build up to understanding.\n\nThe night shower is when you do that building. You're reviewing the details of the day, the specific moments, and constructing meaning from them.\n\nResearch on information processing styles found that bottom-up processors need more time for reflection and synthesis. They can't form conclusions until they've reviewed all the data.\n\nYou need time to gather information and the shower is the perfect place to do it.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Katie Bloomfield. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nA lot of people tell me they could never work with their spouse. But I didn't find Danny, my husband, until I was in my 30s, and once I did, I wanted to spend as much time with him as I could — to catch up on the years we hadn't known each other.\n\nWe met in 2017 and married two years later. Between us, we had five children. I was working in hotel management and helping a friend build her own business, while Danny had been running his own business for years.\n\nAfter we started investing in property and found our strengths complemented each other, I suggested we try running a property management company together. Six years later, we now own £10 million ($13.6 million) worth of property.\n\nWhile I wouldn't suggest to everyone that they should start a company with their partner, the setup has worked really well for us because we've put practices in place to protect our relationship.\n\nWe live in a no-blame culture — both in work and at home. Blame builds resentment. I've seen this a number of times when couples are in business together, and it doesn't end well.\n\nWhen one of us has done something wrong, we don't blame each other; we never make it public, but instead coach each other in private.\n\nInstead of finding fault with each other when something goes wrong, we look at what needs to happen now. What is the next step to take responsibility?\n\nEarly on, we decided that if we were going to go into business together, it was our responsibility to keep our relationship strong and healthy.\n\nIf our relationship broke down, so would the family lives of our kids and our business.\n\nOne very practical way we have done this is by sticking to the 777 rule. Every seven days, we go on a simple date — it might be just a walk or a coffee. Every seven weeks, we may have a bigger, longer date, and every seven months, we take a short holiday, just the two of us.\n\nWe also keep the romance alive — making sure we consistently have sex, making it a goal to be intimate with each other at least 86 times a year, a figure based on a statistic about how much sex healthy couples have. We've both got tattoos that read \"~86\" — just to remind us of how important physical intimacy is.\n\nEvery Sunday, we sit down as a family and make a plan for the week. It's here we make space for work, family, and couple time. Every single thing is on the family calendar.\n\nWe make every effort not to talk about work outside our working hours. If Danny attempts to show me a spreadsheet at 11 p.m., I'll ask him why he is showing me — it isn't work time. Family vacations are, for the most part, work-free.\n\nOccasionally, we don't have a choice — we'll have to work unexpectedly. When this happens, we don't try to multitask family and work. We build in the time we need to work, and get it done during that timeframe.\n\nYou may think that, as joint-business founders, we'd spend all our time together, but we actually work several times apart each week, as our working styles are different.\n\nDanny likes working from coffee shops, whereas I need a quiet space — usually at home. We divide and conquer tasks — often taking meetings separately.\n\nHowever, we really enjoy each other's company — we're obsessed with each other — so we love working together too.\n\nIt's imperative that we communicate clearly with each other, never assuming we know what the other person is thinking.\n\nIt becomes passive-aggressive and can be harmful to the relationship, which, in turn, is harmful to business. Both of us are honest, even blunt, with each other, but always in a kind way, and always in private.\n\nThe reason working together as a couple has worked is because we have put considerable energy into our relationship and ourselves.\n\nWe've both been prepared to hold up a mirror to ourselves, asking what we might need to change, and we've prioritized stretching our relationship.\n\nI wouldn't have gone into business with just anyone, but it works really well with Danny.",

    "fullText": "He worked in Big Tech. Now, he fears half of its software engineers are on the chopping block.\n\nSteve Yegge worked with Jeff Bezos in Amazon's early years. Then he went to Google, where he worked for over 12 years and earned the title of senior staff software engineer. He also knows a thing or two about AI engineering, having written a book on the topic titled \"Vibe Coding.\"\n\nOn \"The Pragmatic Engineer\" podcast and newsletter, Yegge described an imaginary dial of the percentage of engineering staff a company can lay off, ranging from zero to 100. He said he believes the dial is being set at 50 in the age of AI.\n\n\"You're going to have to get rid of half of them to make the other half maximally productive,\" Yegge said. \"We're going to lose around half the engineers from big companies, which is scary\".\n\nThere's a capital-to-labor tradeoff happening in tech. Companies are paying vast sums for tokens and enterprise AI licenses, GPUs, and computing capacity. That money needs to come from somewhere — and for some, it could come from labor costs.\n\nYegge pointed to this tradeoff as the reason for his forecast of 50% cuts becoming the norm. Companies will lay off some engineers to help pay for the others to have adequate access to AI, he said.\n\nHost Gergely Orosz said that 50% cuts would be more than during the COVID-19 pandemic, when tech went through an intense layoff cycle.\n\n\"It's going to be way bigger,\" Yegge said. \"It's going to be awful.\"\n\nThey aren't the only ones referencing the pandemic. In a popular X article, HyperWrite CEO Matt Shumer wrote that AI's impact on work would be \"much, much bigger than Covid.\"\n\nIn recent years, the question of AI-driven layoffs has haunted workers at Big Tech companies, many of which went on a hiring spree during the pandemic. While it's often impossible to boil job loss down a single reason, many suspect productivity gains from AI and ballooning capex spending are fueling the cuts. Some business leaders have also explicitly cited AI when announcing layoffs.\n\nMeanwhile, tech leaders describe smaller teams working more efficiently. On a recent earnings call, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said one engineer could now do the work of a whole team, thanks to AI.\n\nAs AI productivity grows, so have complaints of AI fatigue. Software engineer Siddhant Khare penned a lengthy essay about growing more productive, but also feeling more drained than ever. He told Business Insider that he felt like a \"reviewer\" as opposed to an engineer.\n\nYegge said it's not all bad news for the engineers — just those who want to work at a big company. Engineers who have \"seen the light\" are now getting together, leaving their companies, and creating startups that outpace the industry's giants, he said.\n\n\"We've got this mad rush of innovation coming up, bottom up,\" he said. \"And we've got knowledge workers being laid off by big companies because clearly big businesses are not the right size anymore.\"",

    "description": "Hyperwrite CEO Matt Shumer wrote that people in tech \"aren't making predictions. We're telling you what already occurred in our jobs.\"",
    "fullText": "It's never a good sign when a CEO warns something more disruptive than COVID is heading our way.\n\nIn an essay titled \"Something Big Is Happening,\" Hyperwrite CEO Matt Shumer said AI can now do all of his technical work — and he thinks your job could be next.\n\n\"I'm writing this for the people in my life who don't... my family, my friends, the people I care about who keep asking me 'so what's the deal with AI?' and getting an answer that doesn't do justice to what's actually happening,\" Shumer wrote in his nearly 5,000-word post published Tuesday on X.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, his post had 40 million views and 18,000 retweets. Shumer is a cofounder of OthersideAI, which features Hyperwrite, an AI-assisted writing tool.\n\nShumer said that the reason people in tech \"are sounding the alarm\" is that they have already experienced what's coming for everyone else.\n\n\"We're not making predictions,\" he wrote. \"We're telling you what already occurred in our own jobs, and warning you that you're next.\"\n\nShumer said that many people outside tech wrote off AI years ago after a clunky experience with an early edition of ChatGPT.\n\n\"The models available today are unrecognizable from what existed even six months ago,\" he wrote. \"The debate about whether AI is 'really getting better' or 'hitting a wall' — which has been going on for over a year — is over.\"\n\nIt's not the time to panic, Shumer said. Instead, the best thing to do is to become deeply familiar with AI. \"This might be the most important year of your career,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I don't say that to stress you out. I say it because right now, there is a brief window where most people at most companies are still ignoring this,\" he wrote. \"The person who walks into a meeting and says 'I used AI to do this analysis in an hour instead of three days' is going to be the most valuable person in the room.\"\n\nHe's far from alone in sounding the alarm. Despite disagreement from other tech leaders, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei remains adamant that AI could wipe out up to half of white collar, entry-level jobs in the next one to five years.\n\nxAI CEO Elon Musk and others have warned that if your job doesn't involve physical labor, it's likely to be replaced by AI much more quickly, a view that dovetails with a growing base of economic research.\n\nShumer's essay struck a chord, especially with those in tech. Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian replied, \"Great writeup. Strongly agree.\"\n\n\"Great advice for how to get ahead in your job at any large company right now,\" A16z general partner David Haber wrote.\n\nGreat advice for how to get ahead in your job at any large company right now.\n\n“I used AI to do this analysis in an hour instead of three days\" is going to be the most valuable person in the room. Not eventually. Right now. Learn these tools. Get proficient. Demonstrate what's… https://t.co/cBq5s1AH4Y\n\nWhile the response to the post has been overwhelmingly positive, some X users pointed out the limitations still present in many current AI products, like hallucinations and general inaccuracies.\n\nShumer said that this moment feels like February 2020, when in a short span of time, news of a spreading pandemic gave way to a worldwide upheaval unseen in modern times that continues to reverberate to this day.\n\nThe potential of what AI will change, he wrote, is \"much bigger than Covid.\"\n\nFor Shumer, this moment of realization came with the recent dueling releases of Anthropic's Opus 4.6 and OpenAI's GPT-5.3 Codex. Both models are primarily aimed at software engineering. OpenAI said in its release notes that GPT-5.3 Codex \"is our first model that was instrumental in creating itself.\"\n\n\"It wasn't just executing my instructions,\" Shumer wrote of his experience with OpenAI's latest Codex model. \"It was making intelligent decisions. It had something that felt, for the first time, like judgment. Like taste. The inexplicable sense of knowing what the right call is that people always said AI would never have.\"\n\nAI is now so intelligent, Shumer said, that he can tell the agent what he wants and \"walk away from my computer for four hours, and come back to find the work done. Done well.\"\n\nIn a post on LinkedIn Wednesday morning, Shumer addressed his viral X post.\n\n\"Every time someone asks me what's going on with AI, I give them the safe answer,\" he wrote on Wednesday. \"Because the real one sounds insane. I'm done doing that.\"",

    "fullText": "Looking for divine intervention to boost your stock portfolio? Two new stock indexes from the Vatican may not promise such miracles — but they will help you invest in accordance with Catholic values, Vatican Bank said on Tuesday.\n\nIn partnership with Morningstar Indexes, the bank announced indexes for both the European and US markets: the Morningstar IOR US Catholic Principles index and the Morningstar IOR Eurozone Catholic Principles index.\n\nA statement from the bank said the indexes are \"built following market best practices and in accordance with Catholic ethical criteria, and are designed to serve as a reference for Catholic investments worldwide.\"\n\nThe bank did not share its criteria for selecting stocks that align with Catholic Social Teaching, but all of the stocks in the indexes are pulled from the Morningstar US Large-Mid Index and the Morningstar Eurozone Large-Mid Index.\n\nWhen backtested over the last decade, both portfolios, which contain 50 stocks each, have posted impressive gains. The US index has returned 18% per year on average over the last 10 years, while the European index has returned an average of 10.2%.\n\nThe largest 10 holdings for the US index include: Meta (5.31%), Amazon (5.22%), Nvidia (5.09%), Tesla (4.84%), Apple (4.62%), JPMorgan (4.27%), Broadcom (4.09%), Visa (3.35%), Micron (3.01%), and Alphabet (2.86%).\n\nTop holdings for the European index include: ASML (6.16%), Deutsche Telekom (5.07%), SAP (3.96%), Banco Santander (3.88%), Hermes (3.82%), Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (3.8%), Prosus (3.76%), Vinci (3.46%), UniCredit (3.45%), and Allianz (3.43%).\n\nThe Morningstar IOR US Catholic Principles index joins other faith-based investing strategies launched in recent years, like the Global X S&P 500 Christian Values ETF (CHRI) and the Inspire 100 ETF (BIBL).",

    "description": "Meta's Threads introduces Dear Algo, an AI feature for personalized feeds, as it surpasses 400 million monthly users and outpaces X in daily usage.",
    "fullText": "Threads, Meta's X-like social network, rolled out a feature that lets users tell the app's algorithm what they want to see more or less of in their feed.\n\nThe feature, called Dear Algo, works like this: you write a public Threads post starting with \"Dear Algo,\" followed by a request, such as asking to see less about a TV show you're not caught up on yet, for instance, or more about your favorite basketball team during a live game. The algorithm then adjusts your feed for three days based on what you asked for, and you can delete that request if you want. You can also repost someone else's Dear Algo request to try out their preferences.\n\n\"We think we can do a better job by going deep with individuals on what they want to see more and less of,\" said Connor Hayes, Meta's head of Threads.\n\nIn a blog post about the announcement, Meta described Dear Algo as \"an AI-powered feature that gives you more control over what you see by letting you tell Threads what's important to you in the moment.\"\n\nHayes also said that Threads will reject queries that don't meet Meta's recommendation guidelines or content principles.\n\nThreads teased the feature back in December, framing it as a response to a trend Meta had noticed: people were already posting to ask their algorithms to change what showed up in their feeds.\n\nFor years, people have blamed algorithmic timelines for pulling users into echo chambers, rewarding rage bait over substance, and turning a quick scroll into doomscrolling. Dear Algo could give users back some agency.\n\n\"The best algorithms are personalized,\" Hayes said, adding that what works for one user won't work \"at scale.\"\n\nDear Algo arrives at an interesting moment for Threads. The app now has more than 400 million monthly active users, and on its latest earnings call, Meta said time spent on it jumped 20% in the fourth quarter of 2025. A recent report from analytics firm Similarweb found that Threads had edged out X in daily mobile usage. And in January, Meta started running ads, a sign it sees Threads as a real business.\n\nThe feature also provides a glimpse into the company's broader AI ambitions. On Meta's latest earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Meta is working on merging large language models with the recommendation systems that power Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and its ad system.\n\nThe company's recommendation systems are \"already driving meaningful growth,\" Zuckerberg said on the call. He added that \"the current systems are primitive compared to what will be possible soon.\"\n\nHave a tip? Contact Pranav Dixit via email at pranavdixit@protonmail.com or Signal at 1-408-905-9124.

    "title": "Ford CEO says 'the customer has spoken' after its EV business lost nearly $5 billion last year",
    "description": "Ford once predicted it would sell 150,000 electric pickups each year. Instead, it recorded another multi-billion-dollar loss in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Ford's electric vehicle business lost nearly $5 billion last year — and CEO Jim Farley says the company got the message.\n\n\"So I think the customer has spoken. That's the punchline,\" he said during Tuesday's earnings call.\n\nFord's EV unit posted a $4.8 billion loss in 2025, as sales of its Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning, and E-Transit fell 14% from a year earlier.\n\nNow, the automaker is reshaping its electric strategy — shifting toward lower-cost, high-volume EVs and leaning harder into hybrids. It's a reversal of Ford's early strategy of electrifying its most iconic, priciest vehicles first, betting that brand loyalty and subsidies would offset sticker shock.\n\nFord was one of the earliest legacy American automakers to directly challenge Tesla with mass-market EVs.\n\nThe Mustang Mach-E arrived in December 2020 as a rival to the Tesla Model Y. In mid-2022, Ford launched the F-150 Lightning.\n\nOn paper, the bet was simple: electrify the century-old carmaker's two most iconic nameplates to leapfrog EV startups.\n\nEarly enthusiasm was strong. Ford said it received nearly 200,000 reservations for the Lightning and projected annual sales of 150,000 units.\n\nThat early momentum faded — and never materialized into the high-volume sales Ford was hoping for.\n\nIn 2025, Ford sold 27,307 F-150 Lightnings — down 18.5% from 2024 — and 51,620 Mustang Mach-Es, roughly flat year over year.\n\nSales figures were even more stark after the $7,500 federal tax credit ended last September. The F-150 Lightning's estimated sales dropped from 5,197 units in December 2024 to just 1,724 a year later, according to Ford Authority.\n\nMeanwhile, US EV sales declined while hybrid demand climbed. For example, Ford sold 84,934 hybrid F-150s last year, a 15% increase.\n\nSo, the company is switching up its plans.\n\nThe company has since ended production of its all-electric F-150 Lightning. It will return at an undisclosed time as an extended-range electric vehicle, or EREV — a battery-powered truck with a gas generator onboard.\n\nFord expects the new model will have improved range and increased towing capacity, both of which were concerns for early F-150 Lightning adopters.\n\n\"We're betting on hybrid across our lineup, and EREV where it makes sense,\" Farley said during the call. \"Like a large truck, where towing is a really important application, and both PHEV (plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles) and pure electric will definitely not work.\"\n\nAt the same time, Ford is developing a new \"universal\" EV platform designed for lower-cost, high-volume vehicles.\n\nThe first model — a roughly $30,000 midsize pickup — is expected in 2027. Ford plans to build at least five vehicles off the platform, potentially including SUVs and commercial vans.\n\n\"We aren't just building compliance vehicles at Ford. We're launching a cost-efficient, universal EV platform that will drive profitable growth,\" Farley added. \"Tesla's shown that they could, we can make money in that market, even without subsidy from the government at the right cost level.\"\n\nIt follows a trend in the auto industry. Other major automakers — including Toyota, Subaru, Rivian, Nissan, and Chevrolet — are planning launches for sub-$50,000 EVs this year.\n\nStill, Ford expects its EV business to remain in the red for several more years. CFO Sherry House said the company is targeting break-even for the segment around 2029.\n\nInvestors have taken a cautious view of the company's long-term financial health. Ford missed earnings estimates for the quarter, reporting 13 cents adjusted estimated earnings per share versus analysts' estimates of 19 cents.\n\n\"On paper, it's a big miss, but I don't think it's a big deal,\" John Rosevear, a contributing analyst at The Motley Fool, told Business Insider. \"Ford's guidance for 2026 anticipates nice year-over-year increases in cash flow, as well as higher capital expenditures — all stuff that the market will almost certainly like.\"",

    "title": "The Surprising Colorectal Cancer Symptom James Van Der Beek Said He Missed",
    "description": "James Van Der Beek opened up about the unexpected sign of colorectal cancer he hoped others might get screened before his death. Here’s the symptom he missed.",
    "fullText": "Nearly two years after being diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal cancer, James Van Der Beek has died at the age of 48. The Varisty Blues star died peacefully in his home, according to a post his wife, Kimberly Van Der Beek, made on Instagram. Prior to his death, the Dawson’s Creek actor spoke out about the colorectal cancer symptom he said he ignored.\n\nThe star first opened up about his diagnosis in November 2024. In the months following, he was a vocal advocate for others to get tested for colorectal cancer in their 40s, even if otherwise healthy.\n\n“I was healthy. I was doing the cold plunge. I was in amazing cardiovascular shape, and I had stage 3 cancer, and I had no idea,” he told Healthline the year following his diagnosis.\n\nIt was minor changes in his bowel movements that clued Van Der Beek in to the idea that something might be going on. He previously told PEOPLE that he thought the changes might be related to putting cream in his coffee or drinking too much coffee altogether.\n\n“But when I cut that out, and it didn’t improve, I thought, ‘All right, I better get this checked out,’” he recalled.\n\nColorectal cancer, which is a cancer that initially affects the large intestine, doesn’t always cause symptoms in its early stages. Because of this, it’s often caught after it’s already begun to spread; in 2019, 60% of diagnoses were for advanced-stage colorectal cancer.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute reports that rectal bleeding and diarrhea are two of the most common early symptoms of colorectal cancer in people under the age of 50, along with abdominal pain and iron deficiency anemia.\n\nOther changes in bowel habits, such as constipation, may also be a symptom, as can weakness or tiredness and unexplained weight loss, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nDue to an increase in colorectal cancer among young people, the American Cancer Society has started recommending that people begin to get tested regularly at age 45, rather than the previously recommended age of 50. They also note that anyone who might be at higher risk should consider even earlier screenings.\n\nIncreased risk factors include (but are not limited to):\n\nA close relative who has been diagnosed with colorectal cancer\n\nDiets that are high in red meat or low in vitamin D\n\n“It is the second leading cause of cancer death, but if you look closer, it’s also the most curable,” Van Der Beek told Healthline. “I really want people to understand that [when found] in the early stages, the survival rates skyrocket.”\n\nOur thoughts are with Van Der Beek’s family at this time.\n\nCan Apple Cider Vinegar Lead to Weight Loss?\n\nBobbi Brown Shares Her Top Face-Transforming Makeup Tips for Women Over 50",

    "title": "Death isn't the end: Meta patented an AI that lets you keep posting from beyond the grave",
    "description": "Meta was recently granted a patent for tech to keep your social media accounts running using AI if you take a break or die.",
    "fullText": "Does Meta want to make our social media accounts immortal?\n\nThe company was granted a patent in late December that outlines how a large language model can \"simulate\" a person's social media activity, such as responding to content posted by real people.\n\n\"The language model may be used for simulating the user when the user is absent from the social networking system, for example, when the user takes a long break or if the user is deceased,\" the patent says.\n\nAndrew Bosworth, Meta's CTO, is listed as the primary author of the patent, which was first filed in 2023.\n\n\"We have no plans to move forward with this example,\" a spokesperson for Meta told Business Insider.\n\nIn the patent, Meta lays out why it thinks people might need this.\n\nIf you're no longer posting online — whether that's because you need a break from social media or … you … die — your followers' user experience will be affected. In short, they'll miss you.\n\n\"The impact on the users is much more severe and permanent if that user is deceased and can never return to the social networking platform,\" the document says.\n\nTo fill that void, Meta would essentially create a digital clone of your social media presence, training a model on \"user-specific\" data — including historical platform activity, such as comments, likes, or content — to understand how you would (or rather, did) behave.\n\nThat clone can then respond to other people's content by liking and commenting, or responding to DMs. For influencers or creators who make their livelihoods on Meta's platforms and need to take a break from social media, such a tool could be useful.\n\nMeta's patent also references tech that would allow the LLM to simulate video or audio calls with users.\n\nThe Meta spokesperson said that while it files patents to disclose concepts, a granted patent does not always mean the company will pursue, develop, or implement that tech.\n\nStill, it opens up many questions about the nature of tech — and grief. An AI bot that acts as your understudy while you're on a digital detox is one thing, but imitating people who've died?\n\nEdina Harbinja, a UK-based professor at the University of Birmingham's Law School, has concerns.\n\n\"It does affect not just legal issues, but a lot of very important social, ethical, and deeply philosophical issues as well,\" Harbinja, who specializes in digital rights and post-mortem privacy, told Business Insider.\n\nMeta has thought about managing digital legacies for years.\n\nAbout a decade ago, Facebook launched tools that let people designate a \"legacy contact\" to manage their accounts if they died. And back in the company's metaverse days, in a 2023 interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, Mark Zuckerberg discussed virtual avatars for deceased people.\n\n\"If someone has lost a loved one and is grieving, there may be ways in which being able to interact or relive certain memories could be helpful,\" Zuckerberg said at the time.\n\nThere are a lot of names for this broader category of tech — death bots, ghost bots, grief tech — that are aiming to help people face the loss of loved ones with eternally memorialized digital versions of them.\n\nSeveral startups have launched around this premise, and many have emerged from founders' own experiences with grief. Replika, an AI chatbot startup, was founded in 2015 by Eugenia Kuyda after the loss of her friend. Then there's You, Only Virtual (YOV), which was founded in 2020 by Justin Harrison when his mother was diagnosed with cancer.\n\n\"Everybody in the tech world has been thinking about this for a while, as soon as we started having breaks in generative AI,\" Harrison said.\n\nIn 2021, Microsoft patented an AI chatbot that could simulate a deceased person (as well as fictional characters or celebrities).\n\nMeta's patent signals that the technology category is moving more into the mainstream, Harbinja said.\n\nHarrison isn't surprised to see bigger tech companies dipping their toes in the space, and sees it as a sign that people are beginning to \"feel more comfortable with doing this.\"\n\n\"We can only improve on what we offer people,\" Harrison said, adding that the resources for grieving are \"horrible\" to begin with.\n\n\"I think we have a moral obligation, if we have the potential, to do more for those folks than we should be,\" he said.\n\nAI, death, and grief are not easy topics to digest, however. The intersection of all three is a potent brew of taboos ripe for a philosophical debate on ethics, digital rights, and privacy for any dinner table.\n\nMeta has more than helping people process grief as an incentive to pursue the tech it lays out in its patent, especially for accounts taking a break.\n\n\"It's more engagement, more content, more data — more data for the current and the future AI,\" Harbinja said. \"I can see the business incentive for that. I'm just curious to see how they would, when, and if they will implement this innovation.\"\n\nDepending on how a product like this is rolled out, different questions could come up.\n\nFor instance, would this apply across all of Meta's apps? Would it understand the nuance of your WhatsApp presence vs. the candor you have in the Instagram comment section?\n\nJoseph Davis, a sociology professor at the University of Virginia, said he was concerned with the impact that tools like a Meta bot could have on how humans experience grief.\n\n\"One of the tasks of grief is to face the actual loss,\" Davis said.\n\n\"Let the dead be dead,\" Davis added. \"The idea of bringing them back, but you're not really doing that, but in fact, it looks like that. That's the confusion.\"\n\nHave a tip? Contact this reporter via email at sbradley@businessinsider.com or Signal at sydneykbradley.123.

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kiva Lucero, 21, who is from El Paso and studies in New York City. He is the cofounder of a Paris-based creative collective. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was scrolling on Instagram on Tuesday when I saw the El Paso airspace was closing for 10 days. Immediately, I was stressed and anxious.\n\nI had a flight booked from El Paso to Dallas for Thursday, and then Dallas to Paris, and had to get to Paris by the weekend for work.\n\nWhen I found out that what was supposed to be a 10-day closure lasted seven hours, I didn't feel much relief — I had canceled my flight to Dallas and spent nearly $100 on a bus that I haven't been able to get refunded.\n\nWhen I first found out about the airspace closure at around midnight on Tuesday, I called my airline immediately and explained the situation. I kind of freaked out.\n\nI asked them if it was possible for me to cancel the El Paso to Dallas leg of my flight, and I would just figure out a way to get to Dallas.\n\nThey canceled my flight after a lot of hard negotiation. At three o'clock in the morning, I booked a ticket for a 12-hour bus ride from El Paso to Dallas, leaving at 7 p.m. on Wednesday and getting to Dallas 6:30 a.m. Thursday.\n\nI didn't even know if I was going to make it to the bus. I was thinking El Paso could get completely locked down. I was up all night.\n\nI just didn't expect anything good to come of the situation. I thought it could be a serious evacuation. I called my mom to make sure everything was good, because I didn't want her staying in town if there was a major issue.\n\nWhen I saw on the New York Times in the morning that the closure was lifted, I still couldn't sleep.\n\nI called the airline again to reinstate my original booking, because I didn't want to take a 12 hour bus. Luckily, they did.\n\nBut it was hours of just stress and anxiety and feeling so helpless.\n\nI had already canceled plans with friends and work meetings because I thought I would be on the bus the next day.\n\nThankfully, I should make it to Paris now, but it cost me $100 and a full night of sleep.\n\nA Trump administration official told Business Insider of the disruption: \"Mexican cartel drones breached US airspace\" and the Defense Department \"took action to disable the drones,\" and there was no threat to commercial travel.",

    "description": "\"Dawson's Creek\" star James Van Der Beek died on Feb 11 at 48. He announced his colorectal cancer diagnosis in November 2024.",
    "fullText": "James Van Der Beek has died at 48. His wife, Kimberly, shared the news on her Instagram.\n\n\"Our beloved James David Van Der Beek passed peacefully this morning,\" she wrote alongside a photo of her husband. \"He met his final days with courage, faith, and grace. There is much to share regarding his wishes, love for humanity and the sacredness of time. Those days will come. For now we ask for peaceful privacy as we grieve our loving husband, father, son, brother, and friend.\"\n\nVan Der Beek learned he had stage 3 colon cancer in 2023, and publicly announced his diagnosis in late 2024.\n\nVan Der Beek previously spoke with Business Insider as part of our ongoing series on cancer in younger people. Van Der Beek told Business Insider that the news came as a shock, given the subtleness of his symptoms and his efforts to stay as healthy as possible.\n\n\"I was doing everything,\" he said. \"I was doing sauna, cold plunge, weightlifting, Pilates. I would dance and also do football training.\"\n\nVan Der Beek found instant fame when he was cast as the titular teen Dawson Leery in The WB series \"Dawson's Creek.\" The show ran for six seasons from 1998 to 2002.\n\nWhile on the show, Van Der Beek cemented his 1990s stardom by landing the lead role in the 1999 coming-of-age drama \"Varsity Blues,\" playing Texas high school quarterback \"Mox\" Moxon.\n\nVan Der Beek worked steadily the rest of his career, starring in the cult indie hit \"The Rules of Attraction,\" playing a fictional version of himself on the series \"Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23,\" and performing on \"Dancing with the Stars\" in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, Van Der Beek moved with his family from Los Angeles to Texas to focus on raising their children. His wife, Kimberly, gave birth to their sixth child in 2021.\n\nVan Der Beek said he struggled to process the news of his 2023 diagnosis and cope with his new reality.\n\n\"All these beautiful things that I love, and I used to define myself as — a father, a provider, a husband — all that got taken away, or at least paused,\" he previously told Business Insider. \"I had to sit there and say, 'Well, what am I?' And it was, 'I'm still worthy of love.'\"\n\nTo support Van Der Beek, his former \"Dawson's Creek\" castmates — including Michelle Williams, Katie Holmes, Joshua Jackson, and Busy Philipps — organized a one-night-only live reading of the show's pilot episode in 2025. Held in New York City, the event raised money for F Cancer, a nonprofit focused on early screening and cancer prevention.\n\nOriginally scheduled to perform, Van Der Beek announced that he had two stomach viruses and said he was disappointed he couldn't attend. Lin-Manuel Miranda took on the role of Dawson instead.",

    "description": "Moody's economist Mark Zandi doubts job growth will continue despite a strong January jobs report, due to healthcare reliance and AI risks.",
    "fullText": "The Bureau of Labor Statistics released a delayed January jobs report on Wednesday, beating economists expectations and showing the US economy added 130,000 jobs in the first month of 2026.\n\nMark Zandi says don't get comfortable with the upbeat data.\n\nThe figure is substantially higher than the 75,000 jobs that economists anticipated, but the Moody's Analytics economist isn't optimistic that the growth will continue.\n\nZandi has repeatedly warned that the US economy is on shaky ground, and could tumble into a recession. In a post on X on Wednesday, he said that the latest jobs data didn't do anything to ease his concerns.\n\n\"The job market remains fragile and highly vulnerable,\" he said. \"Yes, payroll employment increased by 130,000 in January, but given the big downward revisions to history, there has been no job growth since last April (Liberation Day).\"\n\nZandi also highlighted that almost all the January jobs growth came from the healthcare industry, something he doesn't think bodes well for the broader US economy.\n\n\"Without healthcare, the economy would be losing lots of jobs and unemployment headed higher,\" he told Business Insider. \"There are good reasons why healthcare is adding jobs, but it shows how vulnerable the job market and economy are if healthcare stumbled or even slowed its hiring.\"\n\nThat's not his only concern. Zandi also warned that a fragile labor market could be further compromised by the impact of AI, something he thinks is approaching quickly. While AI hasn't yet appeared in macro data, Zandi maintains that it is likely to change in the near future.\n\nThe economist added that he thinks rising layoffs will be the clearest indication that the labor market is starting to crack. Companies such as Amazon, Meta, and Pinterest have announced steep job cuts recently, and layoffs throughout the economy touched the highest level since 2009 last month.\n\n\"The best real-time measure of layoffs is weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance,\" Zandi added. \"They are running close to 225k per week, which is low. If they rise above 250k on a consistent basis, the job market is in trouble.\"",

They do not align with my personal values and I know this to be the case for many of you as well.\"\n\nSalesforce has yet to respond to repeated requests about Benioff's comments and did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\n\"I assume there will be a statement that addresses them,\" Seaman wrote. \"If there isn't, I'll talk about it in the next all Slack call, and then I hope we can highlight what was actually super positive from the morning - real, authentic acknowledgment of the work that you've all done and the importance of Slack right now.\n\nSalesforce recently promoted Seaman to executive vice president and general manager of Slack, following Slack CEO Denise Dresser's departure in December to become OpenAI's chief revenue officer.

    "description": "Savannah Guthrie has described her mother as the \"rock\" who held her family together after her father's death when she was a teenager.",
    "fullText": "For over a week, the disappearance of NBC host Savannah Guthrie's mother has gripped her Tucson community and drawn nationwide attention.\n\nNancy Guthrie was reported missing on February 1 after failing to show up for church services.\n\nIn the days since, local authorities and the FBI have launched an expansive multi-agency investigation for the \"Today\" co-anchor's mother.\n\nSavannah Guthrie has described her mother as the \"rock\" who held her family together after her father's death when she was a teenager, and has credited Nancy as a major influence in her life, even encouraging her to pursue a career in journalism.\n\nHere's a closer look at the life of the 84-year-old mother of three.\n\nNancy Guthrie (née Long) grew up in Fort Wright, Kentucky, a small Cincinnati suburb.\n\nShe attended Catholic, all-girls elementary and high schools, and went on to enroll at the University of Kentucky.\n\nWhile there, she worked with the student-run newspaper, the Kentucky Kernel, as a society editor and staff member. She covered Greek life for the publication, her former editor told local Kentucky outlet WKYT.\n\nThe couple were living in Melbourne, Australia — where they had moved for Charles' work — when their youngest child, Savannah, was born in 1971.\n\nSavannah Guthrie has often spoken about growing up in a tight-knit family where faith played a central role.\n\nHer family spent every Sunday at the local Baptist church for Sunday school, morning service, choir practice, and night service.\n\n\"We liked to say that God was the sixth member of the Guthrie family,\" she wrote in a blog post.\n\nThe family moved back to Arizona when Savannah was 2 years old, and her mother has lived in the area since.\n\nWhen Savannah was 16, Charles Guthrie died of a heart attack while working in Mexico.\n\nAfter her husband's death, Nancy Guthrie stepped up as the \"rock\" who held the family together, her daughter has said.\n\nNancy Guthrie returned to work so her children could attend college, taking a public relations job at the University of Arizona so Savannah and Annie could attend tuition-free, the anchor told The Hollywood Reporter in 2016.\n\nUntil then, Nancy Guthrie had raised the family full-time.\n\nIt was Nancy who encouraged her daughter to study journalism in college, which was the beginning of Savannah Guthrie's career.\n\nIn 1993, Savannah Guthrie earned a degree in journalism from the University of Arizona, graduating cum laude.\n\nAfter earning a law degree, she returned to journalism, eventually becoming a co-anchor on \"Today\" in 2012.\n\nWhile Nancy Guthrie has largely maintained a private life, she has occasionally stepped into the spotlight in support of her daughter, appearing publicly with her, including on the \"Today\" show.\n\nThe appearances offered viewers a rare glimpse of the family behind the longtime morning show anchor.\n\nFriends and members of her Tucson community have described her as a consistent presence, including through her church involvement.\n\nFormer actor and KVOA reporter Sally Shamrell said the Guthries \"are a very revered family in Tucson,\" as reported by CBS News.\n\nOn February 1, Nancy Guthrie was reported missing from her Tucson, Arizona, home after failing to show up for church services at a family member's home.\n\nThe Pima County Sheriff's Department and the FBI immediately began a multi-agency search for the 84-year-old, treating the disappearance as a criminal case after finding evidence at her residence that they said suggested foul play.\n\nOn Wednesday, February 4, Savannah and her two siblings released a video on social media pleading with Nancy's potential kidnappers and asking for proof of life and information about her well-being.\n\n\"She is 84 years old. Her health, her heart is fragile,\" Savannah Guthrie read in the video. \"She lives in constant pain. She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive. She needs it not to suffer.\"\n\n\"The FBI is doing everything in our power to bring Nancy Guthrie home to her family,\" said Jon Edwards, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's office in Tucson, at a press conference on Tuesday, February 5.\n\nOn Tuesday, February 10, the FBI released recovered security camera footage showing a masked figure who appeared to be tampering with a doorbell camera outside Nancy Guthrie's home.",

As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve just like any living organism,\" Musk wrote on X. \"This unfortunately required parting ways with some people. We wish them well in future endeavors.\"\n\nMusk outlined the changes shortly after xAI cofounders Tony Wu and Jimmy Ba announced they had left the company. Over the last few days, several other staffers posted on social media that they had also exited.\n\nOver the past few months, Musk expressed displeasure with the progress on Grok Imagine and Macrohard, people with knowledge of the issue told Business Insider.\n\nXAI recently cut a handful of workers who were involved with Macrohard, insiders said.\n\nSome additional staffers had their roles eliminated a few weeks ago, around the same time that Musk reorganized some teams between Wu and xAI cofounder Guodong Zhang, people with knowledge of the move said.\n\nA spokesperson for xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe restructuring announcement comes a little over a week after SpaceX acquired xAI. The combined company is gearing up for an initial public offering this year, according to an internal Q&A on the acquisition shared with xAI staff last week.\n\nWatch the all-hands meeting below:\n\nSince xAI was formed just 30 months ago, the small and talented team has made remarkable progress.\n\nThe future has never looked more exciting! pic.twitter.com/QZ73H2mpBj\n\nDo you work for xAI or have a tip?

    "description": "From drafting documents to reclaiming family time, these solopreneurs explain how AI is changing the way they work, decide, and lead their businesses.",
    "fullText": "When Pete Srodoski meets with a new executive coaching client these days, he can do more in-depth work more quickly, thanks to ChatGPT.\n\nSrodoski, who founded the coaching firm Roll With the Punches in 2021, used to spend hours with clients discussing what should be included in strategic documents. Now, he uses ChatGPT to draft those documents alongside his clients in about 10 minutes.\n\nWith AI handling the initial framework, Srodoski and his clients can jump right into fine-tuning strategic plans and key job descriptions.\n\n\"That allows us to go deeper, go further, actually take those plans and make actionable items,\" he tells Business Insider.\n\nSrodoski is one of three solopreneurs who spoke with Business Insider about how they're using AI to streamline mundane decision-making — like writing initial drafts, formatting emails, or editing social media posts. The time and mental energy saved allows them to focus on the most critical decisions for their businesses and their clients, they say.\n\n\"We want to make the most impact for our time,\" Srodoski says — and AI can help.\n\nGeorgia Fort, founder of Stories by Georgia Fort, is an independent journalist in Minnesota who started using AI about 18 months ago. She uses ChatGPT to format her newsletters and social media posts, and OpusClip to edit videos for social media.\n\nShe estimates that using those services has freed five to ten hours in her workweek — time that she can now apply to the in-depth reporting she's known for.\n\nUltimately, \"the biggest impact is increased output,\" Fort says. With AI assistance, she's able to post more content on social media and release newsletters regularly, something she struggled with in the past.\n\nAn added bonus, she says, is that utilizing AI makes it just a bit easier to find the work-life balance that many solopreneurs struggle with.\n\n\"If nothing else, it's a meal I get to sit down and have with my kids,\" Fort says.\n\nDusti Arab, owner of The Reinvention Co., a boutique marketing firm, says AI is integrated into nearly every aspect of her workday. Because of that, \"I don't think I've put up so much high-quality content, ever,\" she says.\n\nFor Arab, who has ADHD, managing the constant decisions that a solopreneur must make was draining. She would often worry about missing a small detail, which distracted her from higher-level thinking.\n\nNow, she uses Wispr Flow to take voice notes throughout the day on topics like client communications and content ideas. Then, she imports those into Notion AI, which combines access to Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT to help her turn her notes into briefs.\n\n\"If you use AI to process the brain dump first, the deliverable comes out way better,\" Arab says.\n\nHer efforts with AI and being vocal about how she uses it are also paying off in a different way — clients now reach out to her specifically for advice on how to use it. She often guides them in using AI to delegate more effectively.\n\n\"Once the raw notes exist, you can use AI to turn the brain dump into a clear brief, a task list, and a handoff that someone else can actually execute,\" she says.\n\nLike Arab, Srodoski is often the one to introduce his clients to AI, specifically ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity, the platforms he uses. Often, the response is \"awe,\" he says.\n\nLast week, for example, a client shared that the time involved with pricing jobs had become a major roadblock in his business. Using ChatGPT, Srodoski guided him in creating a price book based on the previous three years' sales data.\n\n\"He was smiling ear to ear, saying that this would have cost him a few thousand dollars and a few weeks of labor time to get this pulled off,\" Srodoski says.\n\nWhile clients are often enthusiastic about AI, part of Srodoski's coaching is now emphasizing the decisions that leaders shouldn't outsource to AI.\n\nRecently, he had a client who wanted to confront an underperforming vendor. The client was planning to draft an email using ChatGPT, but Srodoski stopped him.\n\n\"Get on the phone. See how they respond,\" he recalls saying. During the phone call, Srodoski's client was able to explain himself, empathize with the vendor, clarify a misunderstanding, and create a solution.\n\n\"That's a leadership decision you can't do with ChatGPT,\" Srodoski says.",

    "fullText": "Adam Mosseri's multimillion-dollar pay package took center stage on Wednesday as lawyers sought to link Meta's profits to platforms that addict children.\n\nAs the first of several tech executives to testify in a social media addiction trial playing out in Los Angeles state court, the head of Instagram said he is paid roughly $900,000 a year and receives annual performance-based bonuses that can be as high as half of his salary.\n\nLike many executives of publicly traded social media companies, Mosseri, who's been head of Meta's Instagram since 2018, also earns stock-based compensation.\n\nFrom the witness stand, Mosseri said that his stock-based pay varies year to year but that it has been in the \"tens of millions of dollars.\" Some years, he said, he believes it's been over $20 million.\n\nMosseri made the comments while being questioned in Los Angeles Superior Court over a lawsuit that argues Meta and YouTube knowingly engineered their platforms to addict and cause harm to kids. Snap and TikTok were also named in the lawsuit but settled before trial for undisclosed amounts.\n\nMark Lanier, the attorney representing the plaintiff, pressed Mosseri on how the company determined its policy on cosmetic filters, such as filters that alter users' appearances, which was a key topic in court on Wednesday. He brought up Mosseri's compensation again while asking whether banning filters could have hurt Mosseri's bottom line by limiting the company's growth.\n\n\"I was never worried about this affecting our stock price,\" Mosseri said in court.\n\nMeta declined to comment about Mosseri's compensation.\n\nThe lawsuit centers on a 20-year-old woman, identified by the initials KGM, who says her use of social media throughout her childhood negatively affected her mental health, contributing to depression and suicidal thoughts.\n\nThe case is considered a bellwether trial that could indicate how other similar lawsuits related to social media addiction might play out.\n\n\"We strongly disagree with these allegations and are confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people,\" Stephanie Otway, a Meta spokesperson, told Business Insider. Otway said the company has been making \" meaningful changes—like introducing Teen Accounts with built-in protections and providing parents with tools to manage their teens' experiences.\"",

Benioff also complained about Bad Bunny's Super Bowl performance, the people said.\n\nSalesforce hasn't responded to multiple requests about Benioff's comments and did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nSalesforce executives, including Slack's new general manager, addressed Benioff's jokes. Slack general manager Rob Seaman wrote in an internal Slack message viewed by Business Insider: \"I cannot defend or explain them. They do not align with my personal values and I know this to be the case for many of you as well.\"\n\nSome Salesforce employees said they received an email asking them to explain their absence from the event following Benioff's remarks.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "James Van Der Beek was diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal cancer in 2023. He hoped more young people would get screened.",
    "fullText": "James Van Der Beek has died at 48.\n\nIn 2023, the \"Dawson's Creek\" star learned he had stage 3 colorectal cancer at 46. He publicly shared his diagnosis a year later.\n\nVan Der Beek's death comes weeks after a report revealed that colon cancer has become the leading cause of cancer death in people under 50. In 2020, Chadwick Boseman also died from colorectal cancer, at 43, and Catherine O'Hara, who died from a pulmonary embolism last week at 71, had also been diagnosed with rectal cancer.\n\nAfter announcing his diagnosis, Van Der Beek spoke about the importance of getting screened, as rates continue to rise.\n\nSome of the most common symptoms of colon cancer include rectal bleeding, changes in bowel movements, bloating, and abdominal pain.\n\nHowever, they can be subtle, as was the case with Van Der Beek. \"It didn't feel like a real symptom of anything,\" he previously told Business Insider. \"It wasn't anything that made me rush off to go get screened.\"\n\nBecause colon cancer symptoms overlap with GI issues like IBS or hemorrhoids, some people also get misdiagnosed for years — especially if they're young and fit. \n\nJoshua Demb, a researcher who studies early-onset colon cancer and is an assistant professor at the University of California, San Diego, previously told Business Insider that the key is noticing which symptoms feel unusual for you. Even slight stomach pain or bloating can be worth checking out if you otherwise never experience it.\n\nWhile exercising and cutting back on ultra-processed foods are some of the best ways to reduce your overall cancer risk, they're not guaranteed to prevent colon cancer.\n\nVan Der Beek said his diagnosis shocked him because he was \"doing all the biohacking things,\" including eating a balanced diet. \"I was doing sauna, cold plunge, weightlifting, Pilates,\" he said. \"I would dance and also do football training.\"\n\nColon cancer patients who previously spoke to Business Insider expressed similar surprise at their diagnoses, including a personal trainer who ate clean and a marathon runner. It makes it all the more prudent not to assume that an active lifestyle, whole foods-focused diet, and lack of severe symptoms mean you're in the clear.\n\nAfter his diagnosis, Van Der Beek became a spokesperson for Guardant Health to promote the Shield blood test, a less invasive alternative to getting a colonoscopy.\n\nFrom his own colonoscopy experience, he said the procedure could put some people off of screening. \"I did not find a colonoscopy to be all that pleasant,\" he said. \"For people who are in a job where they can't take that kind of time off of work, it can be a challenge.\"\n\nOther at-home tests like Cologuard and the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) are alternative options for people at or above 45, the recommended screening age for colon cancer.\n\nThat being said, colonoscopies are still considered the gold standard in colon cancer screening because they can offer a chance to spot and remove potentially precancerous polyps.\n\nHowever one decides to get screened, Van Der Beek hoped to inspire more people to do it in the first place.\n\n\"That's my biggest message,\" he said. \"Get screened.\"",

It's required more of me — more patience, more discipline, more strength than I knew I had. I knew I was strong — I didn't know I was this strong.\"\n\nThe same month, the 90s heartthrob auctioned off personal memorabilia from the filming of \"Dawson's Creek\" to help his family and meet bills for his cancer treatment.",

    "title": "Apple Just Released iOS 26.3 With These New Features",
    "description": "Here's what's new with Apple's sequel to iOS 26.2.",
    "fullText": "It's officially time for another iPhone update: Apple dropped iOS 26.3 for compatible iPhones on Wednesday, following nearly two months of beta testing. Unlike iOS 26 itself, or even iOS 26.1 and iOS 26.2, iOS 26.3 isn't exactly feature-filled. But there are some interesting (and important) changes that are worth noting, including an easier way to leave iPhone altogether.\n\nBack in December, we learned about a small but substantial new iOS feature: an official way to make transferring between an iPhone and an Android device more seamless. In iOS' \"Transfer or Reset iPhone\" settings, there is now a new \"Transfer to Android\" option. Tap it, and iOS instructs you to place your iPhone near your Android device; from there, you can choose to pass along data like photos, messages, notes, and apps. However, it seems not all data will transfer: Health data, devices paired with Bluetooth, and \"protected items\" like locked notes will not come along with this transfer feature.\n\nApple actually worked with Google directly on this feature, which means it doesn't just go one way: Android users will have a similar option on their end to transfer to iPhone. But those of us updating our iPhones to iOS 26.3 now have an easier escape route if we choose to switch platforms.\n\nWith iOS 26.3, Apple is giving certain users the ability to stop sharing their precise location with their cellular network providers. The new feature, \"Limit Precise Location,\" reduces the exactness of the location data that is shared with cellular networks. That way, the network can determine your general location, but not your precise location. What that means in practical terms, at least according to Apple, is that the network might know what neighborhood you're in, but not the exact street address.\n\nAt this time, only Boost Mobile users in the U.S. will be able to use this feature with iOS 26.3. It also only works with some iOS devices, including the iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, and iPad Pro M5 Wi-Fi + Cellular. Hopefully, this will make its way to more cellular plans and more iPhones in the future, but for now, it's a pretty limited feature. While most of us won't be able to limit precise location sharing with the network, we can at least stop apps from harvesting this data.\n\nTalk about a small update: With iOS 26.3, Apple is breaking \"Weather\" and \"Astronomy\" into their own wallpaper sections. (Previously, these two categories were paired.) While Astronomy features the standard space wallpapers found in iOS 26.2 and earlier, Weather now features three preset wallpapers, with different font options and weather widgets.\n\nBack in September, we learned Apple was quietly working on some type of notification forwarding feature, but other than that basic functionality, the details were left to speculation. At the time, the common assumption was that Apple intended the feature to be used to forward notifications to third-party devices, specifically smartwatches, in an attempt to open up the platform to wearables other than the Apple Watch. This wouldn't be Apple's choice, of course—left to its own devices, the company would keep as many features locked to Apple devices as possible. Instead, the motivation would come from the E.U, which has compelled Apple to make its platforms more cooperative with third-party devices.\n\nAs it happens, this feature is now launching with iOS 26.3—albeit, only in the EU (With the first iOS 26.3 beta, Apple added a “Notification Forwarding” option in Notification settings for all iPhones. They have since removed this option, since the feature is EU-only.) While the option isn't live at this time, Apple does have a description for how the feature works, saying that notifications can be forwarded to one device at a time. Importantly, the description says that when notifications are forwarded to another device, they will not appear on your Apple Watch. Is that limitation really necessary, Apple?\n\nEU iPhone users are also getting another interesting feature with iOS 26.3. The new update will allow users to pair third-party accessories with their iPhones by bringing the devices close together, similar to how pairing AirPods to iPhones works. Developers will need to add this functionality to their devices before this works, of course, but the new update makes it possible.\n\nApple typically bundles its feature updates, like iOS 26.3, with stability patches, including for bugs and security vulnerabilities. This update is no different. Apple's security notes for iOS 26.3 list 37 patches for security vulnerabilities, covering issues across iOS. The most important by far patches an issue with dyld, Apple's \"Dynamic Link Editor,\" which Apple says may have been used in a \"sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.\" The company has used this language before, usually referring to attacks against high-profile users from governments or large organizations. As such, most users likely won't be affected by this bug, but better safe than sorry: update ASAP.\n\nOther important security updates include a patch for a Photos bug that could let someone access your photos from the Lock Screen; a fix for a Screenshots issue that could let an attacker see your deleted notes; a patch for a UIKit bug that could let someone take screenshots of sensitive data when using iPhone Mirroring with Mac; and a fix for a VoiceOver bug that could let an attacker view sensitive information even when your iPhone is locked.",

    "description": "Threat actors get full access to compromised devices.",
    "fullText": "Threat actors don't have to work that hard to obtain sophisticated malware to deploy against unsuspecting targets. A new spyware platform known as ZeroDayRAT is reportedly being sold on Telegram, complete with customer support and updates.\n\nAccording to mobile security company iVerify, this aggressive spyware grants full remote control over devices running Android 15 through 16 and iOS versions up to iOS 26. Once deployed, it allows everything from user profiling and location tracking to live surveillance and financial theft.\n\nThis spyware has wide-ranging capabilities that, according to iVerify, have traditionally been found on platforms sponsored by state actors. Here's a look at what ZeroDayRAT can do:\n\nCollect information about the device, such as model, OS, battery, country, lock status, SIM and carrier info, app usage, live activity, and SMS message previews. This allows threat actors to develop user profiles for further targeting.\n\nPull GPS coordinates, capture notifications from apps and systems, and harvest account information, such as usernames and emails.\n\nSend SMS messages and receive verification codes to bypass two-factor authentication.\n\nLog keystrokes (including biometric unlocks, gestures, and app launches), access the camera and microphone, and screen record.\n\nLog crypto wallet addresses and target banking and payment app credentials via overlay attacks.\n\nZeroDayRAT can infect your device only if a malicious binary—an APK on Android or iOS payload—is downloaded and installed. These may be distributed through phishing, such as links sent via emails, texts, or messaging platforms, as well as in fake app stores.\n\nAll standard guidance for avoiding scams and malware applies: never click links in unsolicited communication, including conversations in apps like Telegram and WhatsApp, and only download apps and extensions from official, trusted sources.\n\nUsers at high risk of being targeted and anyone who wants an extra layer of security can consider enabling Lockdown Mode (iOS) or Advanced Protection (Android).",

    "title": "TikTok's First US-Exclusive Feature Is a Local Feed That Wants Your Location Data",
    "description": "You'll see content relevant to where you are, and you can opt-in to give TikTok your GPS data.",
    "fullText": "It hasn't even been a month since the U.S. arm of TikTok came under new ownership, and already American users are getting an exclusive feature. In a surprise move, the app today introduced a new \"Local Feed\" specific to U.S. users, ostensibly aimed at helping Americans see content from their immediate area. Technically, it's similar to the \"Nearby Feed\" that was introduced in the U.K. and Europe in December, although this specific iteration might differ in the minor details, like the name. Perhaps more importantly, the company wants access to your GPS data to power the Local Feed, but it's opt-in, and you can still use a version of the local feed without sharing it.\n\nTikTok announced its Local Feed today, and it has already popped up in my app without the need for an update or for me to opt into seeing it. It's located to the left of the Following feed, and tapping on it brings you to a scrollable list of posts rather than the usual \"swipe-to-navigate\" autoplaying videos. TikTok says that the feed is \"designed to help you discover and connect with content, businesses, and services wherever you are,\" and yeah, what I saw was mostly restaurant recommendations for New York City.\n\nIt's worth noting that I was already occasionally getting these recommendations on my For You feed, and when I go on vacation, these posts usually change to match wherever I'm staying. So the app's algorithm did already take location into account, at least to a degree. But the Local Feed allows you to choose when to see those posts, instead of waiting for the For You feed to show them to you at its discretion. It also, supposedly, can make them even more specific to your location, which I'll get into shortly.\n\n(Note that while it does originally display as a scrollable list, hopping into a video will allow you to swipe through the feed as usual.)\n\nThe Local Feed showed up for me automatically when I opened my app today, and TikTok confirmed to me on a phone call that you do not have to opt in to seeing it. However, there are some restrictions to what gets posted to it. For instance, accounts belonging to users under the age of 18 won't have their content featured in the Local Feed, and neither will private accounts or accounts where post privacy is set to Friends or Only You.\n\nWhat is slightly concerning about TikTok's Local Feed is a disclaimer towards the bottom of the post announcing it, noting that TikTok will use your GPS location to \"help power the Local Feed.\" However, in a phone call, the company clarified to me that this isn't so clear cut. Essentially, there are two ways for TikTok's Local Feed to know where you are, \"coarse location data collection\" and \"precise GPS data collection.\"\n\nCoarse data collection is how the app worked previously, and it uses information like your IP address, which network you're connecting from, and some of your posting activity (such as how you've been tagged) to generally figure out where you are. This does not use your GPS, and is more similar to, say, Netflix knowing that you're watching from the U.S. based on your wifi network. This functionality cannot be disabled, but TikTok confirmed to me that it tends to only narrow your location down to a county this way, and both the For You feed and the Local Feed can then use that to find information that's relevant to you. Essentially, this is how the app has operated for years, and TikTok confirmed to me that \"nothing has changed with respect to approximate location.\"\n\nWhat's new is the ability to share your precise GPS data with TikTok, which isn't mandatory for the Local Feed to work, but will be used to help the Local Feed deliver even more specific content. For instance, it might show you content for Red Hook or Astoria (specific neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens) rather than just content related to all of Brooklyn or Queens.. According to a TikTok support page, you'll find the toggle to enable this in the TikTok app under Settings and privacy > Privacy, although it's still rolling out to some users, and I don't have it yet.\n\nAccording to the TikTok representative I spoke with, there was initially some confusion among users, as the Local Feed appeared to be showing them content specific to their area even while the app did not appear to be tracking their GPS location in their phones' settings (for iPhone, this is under Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services). However, I was told this was drawn from existing coarse location data (described above), and if you do not have the option to enable Location Services in the TikTok app or you do not see the TikTok app located on the Location Services page in your device settings, then you can rest assured that TikTok cannot access your GPS data.\n\nThat should come as a relief to anyone concerned about TikTok's new privacy policy, which initially appeared to give the company permission to gather your \"precise location\" so long as you had location services enabled on your phone, but now reads that location services need to be enabled for the TikTok app specifically for that to be the case.\n\nIn other words, the Local Feed does not track your GPS data by default, but that doesn't mean you won't see anything if you don't opt in to sharing your GPS data—it'll instead use the same course location data the app has had access to for years to fill that feed. If you want more precise content and are OK with the app tracking your GPS data, then, you simply need to wait for TikTok Location Services to be rolled out to you and then enable it in the TikTok app under Settings > Security and privacy > Location Services.\n\nIf you don't, the company \"does not have access to your precise location,\" a fact noted in a later update to the initial post announcing the Local Feed. Meanwhile, if you don't see the Location Services toggle on that page at all, then according to the update, \"you don't have access to the feature\" yet and need to wait for it to roll out to you. Whatever the case, until you enable that setting, the Local Feed will use approximate data instead.\n\nIf you do enable Location Services for TikTok, the company says it will only track your location while you're using the app, and that when it does, you will see an on-screen indicator while your location is being accessed. Additionally, accounts for users under the age of 18 will be unable to turn GPS sharing on, although it remains optional for all users regardless, and is set to off by default.\n\nMeanwhile, if you want to turn off approximate location tracking, your only choice is to delete the app altogether—although that was also true before the Local Feed was introduced.\n\nUpdate 2/11/2026 at 4:22 PM: Added clarification from TikTok about how the Local Feed feature works, and when it does and doesn't access your data.",

    "description": "You can now \"craft\" gifts within the chat app for some reason.",
    "fullText": "If your chat app of choice is Telegram, you have some changes to look forward to. The company announced a number of updates this week, chief among them a new look for its Android and iOS apps—the former is getting a total overhaul, but iPhone users will still note some new UI elements when chatting with friends on Telegram. There are also some new features, including one I find a little odd.\n\nPer the announcement, the biggest changes come via UI updates, particularly on Android. Telegram says that its Android app has a \"fully redesigned interface\" intended to make navigating the app quicker and more intuitive—Telegram notes the interface code itself was entirely rebuilt to meet these goals. Changes include a new iOS-like bottom bar that lets you switch between your chats, settings, and profile, among other functionality. If you find the new interface effects to be too much, or too big a draw on your battery, Telegram says you can adjust them from Settings > Power Saving.\n\nThe company also updated its iOS app, though not quite in the same way. Telegram says it added \"even more Liquid Glass\" to its iOS app, Apple's new design language for iOS 26, including a redesigned media viewer, sticker and emoji pack preview panels, and new context menus in profiles when choosing messages.\n\nAs of this latest update, if the owner of a Telegram group chat leaves that conversation, the ownership of the group will transfer automatically to one of the group's admins after a week. However, the departing group owner can also choose their own admin if they want to, as Telegram now presets an option to appoint another admin when leaving the group. The company adds that admins can transfer ownership at any time, even if they don't leave.\n\nA small change, but if you develop bots for Telegram, you now have the option to add colors and emojis to those buttons. It's far from a radical update, but it could make it a bit easier to tell options apart at a glance.\n\nA small but noteworthy feature for any Telegram users on iPad: Now, you can send a message using the shortcut \"Command + Enter.\"\n\nAnd here's that weird new feature: I don't usually expect my chat app to offer collectible gifts, but apparently Telegram does. It previously introduced the ability to send gifts to other people, and even upgrade those gifts to collectibles that can be auctioned on NFT marketplaces (which requires real money).\n\nNow, Telegram is reportedly expanding this gift system in the latest update with the ability to combine existing gifts in a new \"crafting\" system to create \"Uncommon, Rare, Epic or Legendary\" versions. You can combine up to four gifts at once, and adding multiple gifts with the same \"attributes\" raises the chance the crafted gift will have that attribute as well. Again, this is the last thing I'd expect or want from a chat app, but, as it's part of this update, so I'm telling you about it.",

    "title": "How Deep Should You Squat?",
    "description": "Most people should squat \"to parallel,\" but there are times for going higher or lower.",
    "fullText": "I’m one who can appreciate the great diversity of squats in the world. High squats, low squats, front squats, back squats—they’re all beautiful. And yet, people on the internet love to argue about which squat is the best. So here’s a little guide to squat depth, and how to find the squat that’s right for you. The short, easy answer is that you probably want to squat \"to parallel,\" and I'll explain what that means, but there are advantages to squatting lower and higher than parallel, depending on your goals in the gym.\n\nWhen people talk about how \"deep\" a squat is, they're referring to how low you get your hips. Some strong and flexible people can squat all the way down until their thighs are touching their calves and their butts are nearly on the ground. Sometimes this is called an \"ass-to-grass\" squat.\n\nIf you can only bend your knees partway before the movement falls apart, you might be told that you're squatting \"high,\" or that you aren't squatting \"to depth.\" If the person who says this is a coach, trainer, or a friend whose advice you value, listen to them, and try to squat deeper. (In a minute I'll give you some tips for how to do that.) On the other hand, if that person is some internet rando or a busybody at your local gym, you do not owe them any specific squat depth and they should mind their own business.\n\nGenerally, the higher a squat is, the easier it tends to be, meaning you can move more weight. When you're training you'll want some to find a way to be consistent. For example, if you squat 225 pounds to parallel at the beginning of your training program, and 315 as a super-high half-squat by the end, you cannot legitimately say that you added 90 pounds to your squat, as the parallel squat and the high squat are basically two different lifts. Pick a depth, and stick to it.\n\nThe best squat depth for most people is squatting \"to parallel.\" This means your thighs are parallel with the floor, or to put it another way, your hips and your knees are about on the same level. (If your hips go lower than your knees, you're \"below parallel\" and if your hips stay above your knees you are \"above parallel.\")\n\nThis is how most people define a full squat, and it's a definition that comes from convenience: It's easy to see when somebody is squatting to parallel, and this makes it easy for a trainer or a competition judge to tell when you're doing a squat. It also keeps things consistent for your training. If you squat to parallel every time, you know you're doing the same difficulty of squat from week to week.\n\nIf you compete in powerlifting, you know that judges will look very carefully at your position in the bottom of the squat to know whether you're doing the lift according to the rulebook. Usually the rule is that your hip joint (or the crease of your hip) needs to go lower than the top of your kneecap. Roughly, this corresponds to your thigh being parallel to the floor, and so people will describe this position as “parallel.” Here’s a video showing what this depth means, and how judges see it:\n\nDo not try to judge this in the mirror while you are squatting! Your eyes aren't at the right level to judge it accurately. Instead, video yourself from the side (with the camera at or below hip level), or ask a friend to watch you squat and tell you if you're hitting the right depth. Another way to make sure you're squatting to a consistent depth is to find a bench or box of an appropriate height, and tap your butt on it with each rep.\n\nYou get more range of motion, thus engaging your muscles better, than if you did a higher squat.\n\nMost people can achieve a parallel squat with training, so even if your mobility isn't great when you first start training, this is an achievable goal.\n\nYou may be able to squat more weight this way than if you go lower.\n\nIt's easier to keep your feet in a stable position on the floor in a parallel squat than in a lower squat (see the point above about mobility).\n\nYou have a consistent basis of comparison from one set to another. (If your squats get higher the more weight you load on the bar, you aren't actually as strong as you think.)\n\nWhat about squatting lower than parallel? First, if you're using \"parallel\" as your gauge, technically any squat lower than parallel still meets the requirement. If you enter a powerlifting competition and squat until your butt is nearly touching your shoes, that's still a legal squat. There's no such thing as being red-lighted for going too low.\n\nBut usually people only squat that low if they have a good reason to do so. Sometimes that reason is personal preference: You may find that your squats are more comfortable (and you may even be able to lift more weight!) if you let your hamstrings kind of bounce off your calves at the bottom of the squat. As long as it's a controlled, precise movement, it's safe and may be effective for you, depending on your body type.\n\nYou'll also often see olympic weightlifters squatting very low. That's because they use squats to help train leg strength for lifts like cleans and snatches, and when you do a clean or a snatch you'll usually end up in a low squat position. Essentially, they train the specific positions that their sport demands.\n\nLow squats are also popular among some gym-goers who want to work on mobility at the same time as strength, or who want to make sure they're training their legs through their full range of motion.\n\nAn important caveat is that not everybody feels comfortable squatting low. If you don't have good ankle mobility, you may not be able to get into a low squat position while keeping your body balanced and your feet firmly on the ground. This position may also put more strain on your knees than you would like, leading some people with knee injuries to prefer higher squats. (That said, deep squats are not proven to lead to knee injuries, no matter what that busybody at your gym says.)\n\nYou train a larger range-of-motion for your leg and hip muscles than with a parallel squat.\n\nYou may see more muscle growth for your glutes and adductors, according to some research.\n\nYou keep your hips and ankles limber.\n\nYou will be better prepared for snatches, cleans, pistol squats, and other movements that require mobility in a deep squat position.\n\nAllow me to pause while the purists clutch their pearls, faint, and wait to be revived, before I note that it's actually not a terrible idea to purposely squat above parallel. There is a place for this in many people's training! I define high squats as those where your hip joint doesn't even get close to being on the same level as your knee. These are sometimes called \"half squats\" (because you're only going halfway to parallel) or sometimes even \"quarter squats,\" if you're just bending your knees a bit.\n\nHalf/quarter squats can be a legitimate training tool, especially for people who train for sports that involve running and jumping. You rarely find yourself in a full squat position in, say, basketball, so training full squats may not be a high priority in the weight room. On the other hand, training half squats can let you load up even more weight than you would use for a parallel squat, letting you overload the upper end of that range of motion.\n\nHigh squats are also often done out of necessity. If you don't yet have the mobility for a parallel squat, or if you're working around an injury that prevents you from bending your knees all the way, you may need to choose between squatting high or not squatting at all. In most of those cases, squatting high is the better option of the two. To make sure you have a consistent target for every set of squats, you can use a tall box, placed just behind you, and squat down just until your butt touches the box. (You can also use a shorter box over time if you are working toward lower squats.)\n\nHalf squats can build strength for running and jumping sports.\n\nSquatting high is better than not squatting at all.\n\nSquatting high may be a stepping stone to getting back to normal depth when dealing with an injury or other issue that prevents you from doing parallel or lower squats.\n\nWhat if you want to squat deeper, but you can't? Most of the time, the issue is ankle mobility. Even though your legs are doing most of the work, and your back is helping to support the weight of the bar, the weak link in your squat is the flexibility of your ankles. Your ankles need to bend pretty deeply to allow you to squat to parallel or lower.\n\nI put together a guide to improving your ankle mobility for squats, but for a quick fix, you can put plates under your heels or wear specialized weightlifting shoes, like these. In addition, make sure to do some calf and ankle stretches before beginning your squats for the day. A few more stretches at the end of the day (or on non-lifting days) can help to get you more ankle mobility over the long term.\n\nYou can also work on ankle mobility over time with stretching and foam rolling. Also, try different stance widths and different types of squats (front squats, goblet squats, high bar, low bar) to see if some are more comfortable for you than others.\n\nOkay, so what if you don’t compete in any squat-centric sport, and you can see upsides to each of the depths we discussed above? Here’s squatting’s dirty secret: It doesn’t matter. The squat police won't come to arrest you if your squats are too high (though some of your gym buddies may heckle you about it, because why aren’t you going deeper?).\n\nYou can move more weight if you only do a partial squat, and every gym has people who will tell you about their huge squat PRs but then it turns out they weren’t getting anywhere near parallel. If you are cheating your squats so you can brag about your numbers, swallow your ego and squat to parallel already.\n\nNor will the squat police come for you if you squat extremely low—but once a week or so, a stranger will tell you you’re going to \"ruin your knees\" squatting like that. You may ignore them. Low squats aren’t inherently bad for your knees, so if you feel fine, you can keep on keepin’ on. (I discuss this myth at length in my guide to squats.)\n\nThat said, if you don’t like squatting low, but you do it because somebody told you you “should,” feel free to ditch that advice and squat to the level you prefer. Squatting ass-to-grass does not make you a better person.",

    "description": "BBC Scotland examines the lie of the land in the Scottish Premiership title race.",
    "fullText": "On a cold Tuesday evening, with 87 minutes of the Edinburgh derby gone, it seemed the Scottish Premiership title momentum was about to jolt towards Glasgow.\n\nBut then Tomas Magnusson popped up in the Hibernian box to knock in a late winner for leaders Hearts. As Tynecastle rocked, the reverberations were felt far west.\n\nThe Gorgie side has restored their advantage to a full six points before their title rivals played. The standard had been set. Keep up if you can.\n\nTime for Wednesday, when Celtic hosted Livingston and Rangers headed to mighty Motherwell, who sit on the top three's coattails in fourth, at Fir Park.\n\nIf you thought Tuesday was dramatic, Wednesday certainly did not disappoint.\n\nWith 90 minutes played at Parkhead, there was a shock on the cards. Livingston, a side without a win in 23 games and who've just changed manager, were about to hold Celtic to a draw.\n\nUp stepped Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, curling in a winner from the edge of the box, on his Celtic debut. His first goal in any game of football for 14 months, and the first time he'd stepped on a pitch since May 2025.\n\nCeltic remain third, but are now a point behind Rangers and within six of Hearts, with a game in hand over both.\n\nOver in North Lanarkshire, it seemed more simple for Rangers. A goal to the good thanks to Nico Raskin's early strike, they also had a man advantage after Lukas Fadinger's red card.\n\nIt seemed they had answered the challenge laid down to them by Hearts, only for Motherwell defender Stephen Welsh to lash home a late equaliser that Danny Rohl's side could not respond to.\n\nRemember, this is on-loan Stephen Welsh who made two appearances for Celtic in January after being recalled, only to rejoin Motherwell on deadline day.\n\n\"Just when there's a twist of fate at Celtic Park a few minutes ago, it's a Celtic player who then comes up with huge goal for Motherwell,\" pundit Stephen Craigan said.\n\n\"Another chapter in what is proving to be the best season we've seen in such a long time,\" was ex-Hearts midfielder Michael Stewart's analysis on Sportsound.\n\nFrom a huge game on Wednesday, to an even bigger one on Sunday afternoon. First travels to second when Hearts go to Ibrox to face Rangers.\n\nDerek McInnes' side won there earlier in the season, for the first time since 2014. They beat Rangers at Tynecastle, too, in a 2-1 win in December.\n\nBut, Rohl's men haven't lost since then. In fact, they've drawn twice and won seven. It's resurgent form that looks a world away from a team which were once 13 points adrift in the title race under Russell Martin.\n\n\"I think it is a pretty good point [against Motherwell] but as Danny Rohl mentioned, there's a massive game on Sunday [against Hearts] and that starts to look like a must-win,\" said former Rangers midfielder Derek Ferguson.\n\nCeltic will be looking on, crossing their fingers and wishing for a draw.\n\nThey'll be fresh off the back of a game against Kilmarnock down at Rugby Park. The last time they were, they won thanks to a late Kelechi Iheanacho penalty.\n\nThey'll need a better performance than the one against Livingston. Although they peppered the visitors' goal with shots, the lack of cutting edge will be a worry.\n\n\"Celtic were running out of ideas, very predictable, just playing it across, hoping rather than making it happen, and they just got away with it right at the end,\" said former keeper Pat Bonner.\n\n\"What a huge three points it is for Celtic. They'll be relieved.\"\n\nIt was another sterling performance from Motherwell, adding to a catalogue of fine showings this season.\n\nAgainst the top three, they have two draws with Hearts, two draws and a loss against Rangers, and a win and loss to Celtic.\n\nSeven points against the title favourites is no bad return and many Motherwell fans might be wondering \"what if?\"\n\nWhat if they hadn't drawn their first five league games? What if they hadn't chucked away a 3-0 lead over Hearts at Tynecastle?\n\nWhat if Calum Ward hadn't passed it straight to a Celtic player when they were 2-1 up at Celtic Park with 20 minutes to go?\n\nThey sit seven points behind third-placed Celtic, eight behind Rangers and 13 behind Hearts. It's most likely a step too far, but one of the Old Firm might be within their reach, including holding a game in hand over Rangers and the league leaders.\n\n\"What a team Motherwell are,\" Stewart gushed. \"They are such a great watch and showed some real desire.\n\n\"One nil down at home, down to 10 men, and they never buckled one little bit. They kept throwing everything at it. That's a good point for Rangers, because Motherwell were so on top.\"\n\nFormer Rangers midfielder Derek Ferguson agreed: \"This is a Motherwell side that have been absolutely flying and they've shown different sides to their game tonight.\"",

Parker's team had not only given away two easy goals, they had failed to register a shot on target in the first 39 minutes of the contest.\n\nThe seven that followed had to be seen to be believed.\n\nHannibal Mejbri made it 2-1 with his first goal of the season, before Jaidon Anthony arrowed a low shot into the corner to bring Burnley level four minutes later.\n\nBurnley's extraordinary comeback was complete in first-half stoppage time, when goalkeeper Dean Henderson parried Bashir Humphreys' header on to the foot of Jefferson Lerma and into the net to spark jubilant, almost disbelieving scenes in the away end.\n\nThis extraordinary result may prove too little, too late for the Clarets in their battle to avoid relegation.\n\nBut it was just the tonic for manager Scott Parker, who was subjected to chants of 'you don't know what you're doing' and 'you're getting sacked in the morning' by his own supporters during last weekend's defeat by West Ham at Turf Moor.\n\n'Up to owner to make change' - Dyche under major scrutiny\n\nWill West Ham make 40-point mark crucial in relegation fight?\n\nHaving endured one of his toughest afternoons of his Burnley tenure on Saturday, Parker looked like he was trying to keep a lid on his emotions after Tuesday's astonishing victory.\n\nBut you could hear the fierce pride in Parker's voice as he spoke about his players' heroics in his post-match interview with TNT Sports.\n\n\"There aren't many teams who would come back here after going 2-0 down,\" he said. \"It speaks absolute volumes for this group.\n\n\"If there was ever any question about how together this group is, how committed this group is, how resilient this group is – [tonight] said it all, really.\"\n\nParker's team remain nine points adrift of safety with only 12 matches of the 2025/26 season left to play.\n\nBut neither Parker, nor his players have given up hope of mounting a late survival charge.\n\n\"There has always been belief [that we can stay up],\" he continued. \"The results over the last few months probably haven't gone our way, but tonight that definitely was the case,\" he said.\n\n\"Coming off the back of an incredibly tough game for us at the weekend – for many reasons – that performance showed a group that is full of resilience, full of commitment.\n\n\"You don't get that result without proper resilience, standing up to certain battles and certain situations. The biggest lesson for any group is to keep coming back up.\n\n\"We certainly did that tonight.\"\n\nSo where does Tuesday's result leave Palace?\n\nIn stark contrast to his opposite number, Oliver Glasner looked ashen-faced when he addressed the media after the full-time whistle, which was greeted by loud boos from the Palace supporters.\n\nHaving watched his team arrest a 12-match winless run against arch rivals Brighton last time out, Glasner looked set to mark his 100th match in charge of the club with another morale-boosting win after Strand Larsen's double.\n\nBut Palace froze after Mejbri had pulled a goal back for Burnley, who took full advantage of the hosts' inertia to inflict one of the most painful defeats of the Austrian's Selhurst Park tenure.\n\n\"It's not acceptable,\" Glasner, who is leaving the club in the summer, told TNT Sports. \"I can't explain it. Maybe [the first 39 minutes] were too easy.\n\n\"The start was very good. We controlled everything, [but] I've watched all the goals back and it's just not acceptable how we defended as a team – just jogging around, not in the duels, not in the second balls.\"\n\nAnother issue, according to Glasner, is the presence of a Marc Guehi-sized hole in the Palace defence.\n\nThe England defender left for Manchester City for an initial £20m last month in a move which incurred the wrath of Glasner, who announced his own departure not long afterwards.\n\n\"Right now, we don't have someone on the pitch who leads the team in these moments, who makes players calm and decides the meaning of the game,\" he said.\n\n\"I praise the boys very often for their effort. When you throw the game away like we did, you don't deserve to win.\"\n\nPalace are still eight points above the bottom three – a sizeable cushion, but one not comfortable enough for a side with only one win in all competitions since 11 December.\n\nDefeat at home to Wolves in their next league game really would set alarm bells ringing.\n\nLatest Burnley news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Burnley - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Martin O'Neill hails Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's impact after the former Arsenal and Liverpool midfielder nets a crucial winner on his Celtic debut.",
    "fullText": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain only had 14 touches after being introduced for his Celtic debut as a 78th-minute substitute against Livingston on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, one of them could have a telling influence on the Scottish Premiership title race.\n\nThe defending champions were on course to drop points against the division's bottom club after missing chance after chance, with visiting goalkeeper Jerome Prior making nine saves in total.\n\nBut Oxlade-Chamberlain - who arrived on a free transfer on Saturday on a deal until the end of the season - whipped home his first Celtic goal in stoppage time to secure a 2-1 win, sparing blushes and narrowing the gap to Hearts at the top to six points.\n\nIt was not the finish of a man whose previous game of football was last May and has been without a club since being released by Besiktas in August.\n\nInstead, it was a reminder of the quality that helped him win three FA Cups with Arsenal, the Champions League, Premier League and League Cup with Liverpool, while also establishing a regular spot in England's midfield.\n\n\"It was a class goal from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain,\" former Scotland midfielder Michael Stewart said on BBC Radio Scotland.\n\n\"Just a calm, composed, quality finish. What an impact he's had already.\"\n\nCeltic 'perfect fit' as Oxlade-Chamberlain signs\n\nOxlade-Chamberlain scores debut winner as Celtic scrape past Livi\n\nInterim manager Martin O'Neil - who remains unbeaten in domestic competition across both his spells in charge this season - was delighted by his newest signing's contribution.\n\n\"We didn't look like we were going to get any reward at all and Alex scores this brilliant goal,\" the Northern Irishman said.\n\n\"When it left his foot, I could see it going in and that was a real delight.\n\n\"He's been a really fine player in his career, an excellent career. It's just a matter of him getting up to speed and I think that will come. He's naturally fit and hopefully he will be a big asset to us.\n\n\"He had a choice of a lot of teams. He's decided to come up here and help us out. He's done more than that, he's got us three points on the board.\"\n\nOxlade-Chamberlain has been training with Arsenal in recent months and thanked the Premier League leaders for helping him to hit the ground running in Glasgow.\n\n\"It means a lot,\" he said after his dramatic return to competitive action.\n\n\"I have to say a big thank you to everyone at Arsenal, giving me the chance to keep my fitness up, and an even bigger thanks to the manager here for giving me the chance to put on this kit and play for this amazing club.\n\n\"When you get those opportunities, you want to be able to pay back with moments of quality like that.\n\n\"It's been difficult. Sometimes the way things go in football, especially when you cross that 30-years-of-age barrier, you're not as valuable as you once were in a business sense.\n\n\"I knew I still had a lot to give and training every day for the last three months where I was training gave me the confidence that I can still offer a lot to the game.\n\n\"I'm delighted to be here and have the opportunity to do that and help these boys.\"\n\nThe 32-year-old's last-gasp goal takes Celtic within a point of Rangers - who drew 1-1 at Motherwell - in second and closer to Hearts, while O'Neill's side carry that game in hand over both.\n\n\"Tonight is a great start for me, but more importantly keeps our goals alive and keeps us going in the right direction,\" Oxlade-Chamberlain added.\n\nHe says he leapt at the chance to move to Parkhead, with a wee push from his dad.\n\n\"It's an amazing opportunity. When it came up, I didn't doubt it for one second,\" he said.\n\n\"My dad's from an era where this club means a lot. He was straight away telling me 'I'll get you in the car and drive you up there myself'.\n\n\"It's a great start, but I know there's a lot more to it than 13 minutes.\"\n\nVisit our Celtic page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Celtic news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "fullText": "Bruce Mouat recovered from his Winter Olympics mixed doubles disappointment in some style, delivering an accomplished display to lead his Team GB men's rink to a 9-4 victory in their opening match against China.\n\nLittle more than 24 hours earlier, Mouat and Jen Dodds had faltered in the bronze-medal match in the Cortina Curling Stadium for the second successive Games.\n\nBut the 31-year-old showed why he is considered one of the world's best, as the gold-medal favourites started strongly in their attempt to upgrade the silver they won in Beijing four years ago.\n\nThe Scots, world champions in three of the past five years, traded points with China in the opening two ends, before a classily compiled three in the third cleaved open an advantage that they would never cede.\n\nThey led 5-2 at the break, then a magnificent double take-out and composed closing throw by Mouat extended the advantage to 8-3 after seven.\n\nA judicious set of throws limited the Chinese to one in the eighth but GB closed down the ninth end, taking one to force a round of handshakes with an end to spare.\n\nIt always looked like being a mismatch and so it proved.

    "fullText": "The 40-point mark - or thereabouts - could well be back in vogue when it comes to guaranteeing Premier League survival this term, with an in-form West Ham attempting to chase down the sides above them.\n\nThat mythical number has often been cited as the threshold at which managers, players and fans can relax - but the total has not actually been needed to stay up since 2010-11.\n\nPrior to that the only other occasions clubs were demoted with 40 points or more were 1996-97, 1997-98 and 2002-03.\n\nBut could that be about to change?\n\nWest Ham, who are 18th in the top flight, are only three points behind 17th-placed Nottingham Forest, while Tottenham - who sacked boss Thomas Frank on Wednesday - are 16th, another two points ahead of Forest.\n\nWith 12 games remaining history shows the Hammers are more than capable of surviving, and in Nuno Espirito Santo they have a manager who knows what it takes to stay up from his time at Forest.\n\nWest Ham's current points tally (24) is the most by any side in 18th at this stage of a campaign since 2019-20, when the Hammers recovered to stay up with 39 points.\n\nAnd they are arguably the form club in the lower reaches of the table, with three wins helping them take 10 points from their past five games.\n\nLeeds also look to have found some momentum with recent wins over Fulham and Forest as well as draws at Everton and Chelsea.\n\nIn contrast Spurs have managed a meagre four points from the previous 27 available to them.\n\nMeanwhile, Forest have won just two of their past 10 games and fans of Brighton and Crystal Palace may also be looking over their shoulders.\n\nThe 14th-placed Seagulls (31 points) are on a dismal run having won just one top-flight game since 30 November.\n\nPalace - who are a place and a point above Brighton - have only tasted victory once since 7 December and most recently let a two-goal lead slip as they lost to struggling Burnley.\n\nHad West Ham held on to beat Manchester United on Tuesday, they would have equalled the record for the best points tally by an 18th-placed side at this stage of a 38-game campaign.\n\nAs it is they are a solitary point better off than the average for teams in that position - and look likely to need more than the 36 points that has ensured safety in the past nine seasons.\n\nWest Ham hold the record for being relegated with the most points (42) in a 38-game season, going down in a dramatic conclusion to the 2002-03 campaign after drawing against Birmingham.\n\nThat year they took 22 points from their final 12 games - and they have history for finishing strongly.\n\nThis is the sixth Premier League campaign where West Ham have had as few as 24 points at this stage - in the previous five seasons, they survived three times.\n\nThe Hammers earned 15 points or more from their last 12 matches in 2006-07, 2019-20 and 2022-23 to stay up.\n\nIn only one of the previous five seasons have they gone down with a whimper by taking fewer than 15 points from their remaining 12 games (2010-11).\n\nThis year's fixture list has ensured another potentially gripping finale with Nuno's side ending their season at home to Leeds, who are presently six points clear of them.\n\nAnd should the Hammers continue their recent revival, that magic 40-point mark could well be needed once more to avoid dropping into the Championship.\n\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place",

    "description": "Sir Keir Starmer says comments by the businessman and Manchester United co-owner are \"offensive and wrong\".",
    "fullText": "Sir Keir Starmer has labelled comments about immigration made by billionaire Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe as \"offensive and wrong\".\n\nSir Jim, founder of one of the world's largest chemical companies, Ineos, told Sky News on Wednesday that the UK had been \"colonised by immigrants\" and suggested the prime minister was \"too nice\" to do \"difficult things\" to stabilise the country's economy.\n\nIn his rebuke on Wednesday evening, Sir Keir added that Britain was \"a proud, tolerant and diverse country\" and called on Sir Jim to apologise.\n\nA spokesperson for No 10 also called on the businessman to apologise, saying the comments \"play into the hands of those who want to divide our country\".\n\nThe BBC has approached Ineos and Manchester United for comment in regards to Sir Jim's remarks.\n\nSir Jim told the broadcaster: \"You can't have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in.\"\n\nHe added: \"I mean, the UK has been colonised. It's costing too much money.\n\n\"The UK has been colonised by immigrants, really, hasn't it? I mean, the population of the UK was 58 million in 2020, now it's 70 million. That's 12 million people.\"\n\nHowever, data from the Office for National Statistics estimates that the UK's population in mid-2025 was 69.4 million, compared with 66.7 million in mid-2020.\n\nSir Jim made the comments during an interview with Sky News' economic editor Ed Conway, on the fringes of the European Industry Summit in Antwerp, Belgium.\n\nThe remarks were also condemned by various fans groups, including the Manchester United Supporters Trust which said on X: \"No fan should feel excluded from following or supporting the club because of their race, religion, nationality or background. Comments from the club's senior leadership should make inclusion easier, not harder.\n\n\"This is not about politics; it is about ensuring that the custodians of Manchester United act in a way that unites supporters rather than marginalising any part of our fanbase.\"\n\nManchester United Muslim Supporters Club also said it was \"deeply concerned\" by the remarks, adding that the term colonised \"is not neutral\".\n\n\"It echoes language frequently used in far-right narratives that frame migrants as invaders and demographic threats,\" it added.\n\nShow Racism the Red Card said the cultural influence held by football clubs \"should be used to challenge racism, not inadvertently amplify narratives that undermine community harmony\", while Kick It Out said the comments were \"disgraceful and deeply divisive\".\n\nThe 1958 Group of Manchester United supporters described the comments as \"very ill-advised\", and criticised Sir Jim for \"commenting on the issues of our country while living in Monaco to avoid paying tax\".\n\nThe 73-year-old said politicians needed to be \"prepared to be unpopular for a period of time to get the big issues sorted out\".\n\nSir Jim has restructured United since acquiring a 27.7% stake in 2024, making 450 redundancies, overhauling senior management and sacking two managers.\n\nHe said that although some of his decisions had been unpopular, he had had to make them \"to get the big issues sorted out\".\n\n\"If you do difficult things, which we felt that we had to do at Manchester United... we felt like they were the right things to do. But you do become very unpopular for a while,\" said Sir Jim.\n\nHe added: \"But you've got all the same issues with the country. If you really want to deal with the major issues of immigration, with people opting to take benefits rather than working for a living, if you want to deal with that, then you're going to have to do some things which are unpopular, and show some courage.\"\n\nSpeaking about the prime minister, Sir Jim said: \"It's a tough job, and I think you have to do some difficult things with the UK to get it back on track.\"\n\nSir Jim said he had met Reform UK leader Nigel Farage recently, and described him as an \"intelligent man\" with \"good intentions\", but added that \"in a way, you could say exactly the same about Keir when Keir came in\".\n\n\"I think it needs somebody who's prepared to be unpopular for a period of time to get the big issues sorted out,\" he added.\n\nIn response to Sir Keir's condemnation of the comments, Farage said on X: \"Britain has undergone unprecedented mass immigration that has changed the character of many areas in our country.\n\n\"Labour may try to ignore that but Reform won't.\"\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described Sir Jim's comments as \"totally wrong\" and \"totally out of step with British values\", also calling on him to apologise.\n\nAccording to the Sunday Times' Rich List, Sir Jim, who was a Leave campaigner in the run-up to the Brexit referendum, was the 7th richest person in the UK in 2025, with a net worth of about £17bn.\n\nHe reportedly moved from the UK to Monaco in 2020, a place that does not collect personal income tax or capital gains taxes.\n\nIneos' raw materials are used in everything from packaging for toiletries, medicines and food, to mobile phones and furniture.\n\nIn recent years, Sir Jim's business interests have moved away from chemicals, including a discontinued plan to build a new vehicle based on the Land Rover Defender, as well as Ineos' purchase of luxury motorcycle wear brand Belstaff.",

    "fullText": "A Washington, DC, panel rejected Jeanine Pirro’s lame attempt to indict six Democratic Congresspersons merely for reminding military and intelligence officials to obey the law.\n\nThe entrance to the Supreme Court building announces “Equal Justice Under Law,” but it hasn’t felt like SCOTUS represented that American value for quite some time—roughly since Bush v. Gore in December 2000, even more so since gutting the Voting Rights Act in Shelby in 2013, and especially since the John Roberts court declared, in 2024, that the president is immune from punishment for “official acts,” even those demonstrably illegal, while in office.\n\nMeanwhile, an undersung underpinning to American justice has repeatedly emerged as the hero in this second, lawless Donald Trump administration: local grand juries, most famous for the slur that they’ll easily indict a ham sandwich. That was never (uniformly) true, but the low expectation of rigor has served to focus attention on the ways these ordinary citizens have courageously stood up to Trump when so many elites, including universities, law firms, the GOP Congress, and six of nine SCOTUS justices, have caved.\n\nThe most recent grand jury victory for democracy came late Tuesday afternoon, when a Washington, DC, panel refused to indict six Democratic Congresspersons, all military veterans, who recorded an ad reminding their military and intelligence community colleagues that they are not obliged to obey illegal orders from their superiors. The stirring ad, titled “Don’t Give Up the Ship,” merely repeated language common to US military training courses since World War II.\n\nThe FBI had been investigating all six: Senators Mark Kelly of Arizona and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, along with Representatives Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is conducting his own petty jihad against Kelly, formally censuring him and docking his retirement pay. “[Kelly] released a reckless and seditious video that was clearly intended to undermine good order and military discipline,” Hegseth claimed last month. The grand jury can’t undo Hegseth’s frat-boy grandstanding, but it protects all six from prosecution.\n\nProsecution on what grounds has never been clear. Trump immediately pronounced their move “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” Barely hinged Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro, now unbelievably serving as US Attorney in Washington, DC, approached the grand jury trying to argue that the lawmakers “violated a statute that forbids interfering with the loyalty, morale or discipline of the U.S. armed forces,” according to The New York Times.\n\nRemember that local grand juries also refused to indict the Subway sandwich-throwing hero, Sean Dunn, New York Attorney General Letitia James (twice), and multiple ICE observers outside Chicago’s Broadview detention facility.\n\nAfter the grand jury’s decision, Mark Kelly declared, “This is an outrageous abuse of power by Donald Trump and his lackeys. Trump wants every American to be too scared to speak out.”\n\nJason Crow went further: “If these fuckers think that they’re going to intimidate us and threaten and bully me into silence, and they’re going to go after political opponents and get us to back down, they have another thing coming. The tide is turning.”\n\nLet’s hope so. Attorney General Pam Bondi is testifying before the House Judiciary Committee Wednesday to answer questions about her lawless department. She should get some good ones. Maybe even from Republicans?",

    "fullText": "Pep Guardiola vowed his Manchester City side would \"breathe down the neck of Arsenal\" as they aim to hunt down the Premier League leaders in this fascinating title race.\n\nThey backed up Sunday's astonishing comeback victory at champions Liverpool by taking apart Fulham in the first half on Wednesday night.\n\nGuardiola's men have started to gain momentum and now trail the Gunners by just three points with an intriguing battle developing between the top two.\n\nMikel Arteta's side travel to tricky Brentford on Thursday hoping to regain their six-point advantage but go into the game under pressure knowing City did their job in style.\n\nGuardiola, though, was not getting drawn into title talk at this stage of the season, saying: \"We were not nine points [adrift] before Anfield, we are not three points [adrift] before Brentford v Arsenal, after that we will see.\n\n\"I always say the focus is to grow, grow, grow. It's how we can be more consistent over 90 minutes, how we can be better and the players feel that [they are] doing what we want to do.\n\n\"'We can do it in terms of mentality and patterns defensively and offensively. We are doing that.\"\n\nMan City beat Fulham to close to three points on Arsenal\n\nThe celebrations between a group of City players at full-time to preserve a clean sheet epitomised the togetherness that has been forged and the character they are able to display.\n\nThe result at Anfield appears to have given City and Guardiola renewed belief that they are capable of chasing down Arsenal, despite not being at their rampant best this season.\n\nCity have the know-how of getting the job done, having been top dogs in six of the past eight seasons, while Arsenal will be hoping there isn't a familiar story to the past three campaigns when they have finished runners-up.\n\nFormer Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given told BBC Radio Live: \"There are still fragilities we haven't seen in the past perhaps, but they still have the armoury I think to go on a crazy run now and be unbeaten and all that stuff.\n\n\"It's not that big of a statement to say that. The manner in which they won on Sunday, the psychological side. They have gone 'this is ours for the taking'.\n\n\"The belief runs through the whole club and fans where they think, 'do you know what, we still have a great chance'. That will give them belief for this run-in.\"\n\nEx-England striker Alan Shearer added on BBC Match of the Day: \"I don't think it would surprise many people if they went on a run. Particularly after the game at the weekend, you could see they were full of confidence, belief and energy.\n\n\"They have done their job tonight and put the pressure back on Arsenal with a three-point gap now.\"\n\nThe weight of expectation will lie heavily on Arsenal's shoulders before facing the Bees, with an uncomfortable night's sleep in store after seeing City take apart Fulham in a clinical first-half showing.\n\nBut Arsenal know they can respond by claiming three points at the G Tech Stadium and if they follow it up by beating bottom side Wolves next Wednesday, the tantalising prospect of a nine-point lead awaits.\n\nThe two sides meet in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday 22 March with the chance of inflicting the first direct psychological blow.\n\nRecent history shows that seven of the last 12 winners of the EFL Cup have gone on to win at least one other trophy in the same season, highlighting the importance of claiming the trophy at Wembley next month.\n\nThey are scheduled to meet at Etihad Stadium in the Premier League in April but the rivalry could see them face each other another three times if they progress in both the Champions League and FA Cup.\n\nWhile Arsenal did not sign anyone in the January transfer window, City added Antoine Semenyo, who has scored five goals already, and England international Marc Guehi, who contributed to a clean sheet.\n\nGuardiola said his side are \"growing\", adding: \"We were together, more calm with the ball, we made inside, outside [runs]. I would say the position was not perfect for Nico O'Reilly and Phil [Foden] but sometimes it happens to be in better positions, but in general really pleased.\n\n\"We suffered a lot at Fulham and today, after physically and emotionally at Anfield, it is really tricky but we talked a lot and I said 'guys we have to do it again' and we did it.\"\n\nA long and arduous season is bound to take its toll at some stage and star striker Erling Haaland could do with a rest.\n\nThe Norwegian scored in Wednesday's 3-0 win over Fulham to take his tally to 42 in as many games this season for club and country.\n\nThe 25-year-old, though, scored his first non-penalty league goal since 20 December against West Ham, ending a run of 24 shots from open play without scoring.\n\nBut he featured in only the first half against the Cottagers, being replaced by Omar Marmoush at half-time.\n\nGuardiola said the player was feeling some \"niggles\", adding: \"He [Haaland] said, 'I don't feel comfortable' and 3-0 [ahead] with a lot of games and having Omar, common sense [to subsititute him].",

    "fullText": "Captain Harry Brook said England's batters were \"too careful\" in their 30-run defeat by West Indies at the T20 World Cup.\n\nEngland reached 74-1 in pursuit of 197 but lost six wickets in succession to spin in the middle overs and were bowled out for 166 in 19 overs.\n\nBrook, who was out caught and bowled for 17, was one of three batters dismissed by spinner Gudakesh Motie.\n\n\"I'd much rather get caught on the boundary than the way I did today,\" Brook said.\n\n\"He was the main threat at that time so I was just trying to knock it into the leg-side and get Sam [Curran] back on strike.\"\n\nEngland spun out by West Indies at T20 World Cup\n\nProteas edge Afghanistan after two super overs\n\nAustralia leave Ireland on brink of World Cup exit\n\nBrook's assessment is a familiar one.\n\nAfter England were bowled out for 131 in a one-day international against South Africa last year, he said his could have \"gone a little bit harder with the bat\".\n\nWhen they lost an ODI in New Zealand before Christmas, Brook asked, \"Can we go harder?\".\n\nAgainst the impressive Windies, Tom Banton also chipped a catch to extra cover pushing a drive off Motie, while Jacob Bethell and Will Jacks were bowled and pinned lbw respectively playing from the crease.\n\n\"Chasing nearly 200 is always a big ask and we thought the pitch would get a little bit better and it would slide on to the bat a little bit more, but that didn't happen,\" Brook said.\n\n\"We were probably a little bit careful, myself included.\"\n\nIn the absence of dew, which makes it harder for bowlers to grip the ball, the pitch at Wankhede Stadium offered more turn than any other at this World Cup so far.\n\nEngland played spin well on their recent tour of Sri Lanka, where they won a T20 series 3-0, but here familiar issues resurfaced.\n\n\"I thought we played spin outstanding in Sri Lanka and we've just had a bad day today,\" Brook said.\n\n\"We didn't manage to get over the line and they bowled well.\"\n\nBrook also backed leading pace bowler Jofra Archer, who conceded 48 runs from his four overs after being hit for 42 in the win over Nepal on Sunday.\n\n\"Everybody knows how good Jof is,\" Brook said.\n\n\"He'll bounce back for sure. He's bowling rapid and I'm sure he'll execute better in the coming games.\"\n\nEngland face Scotland on Saturday before their final Group C match against Italy on Monday, with both games taking place in Kolkata.",

    "description": "Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson miss out on becoming the first British figure skaters in 32 years to win an Olympic medal, as they fail to make the ice dance podium.",
    "fullText": "Lilah Fear said she could not believe the \"costly and devastating\" error she made which meant she and partner Lewis Gibson missed out on the ice dance medals at Milan-Cortina 2026.\n\nFear and Gibson finished seventh overall, meaning they failed to reach their goal of being the first British figure skaters in 32 years to win an Olympic medal.\n\nFear tripped on the second element of their free-dance routine, and despite skating cleanly for the remainder it proved too much of an obstacle to overcome.\n\nIt means the wait goes on for British skating since Dame Jayne Torvill and Sir Christopher Dean won bronze at the Lillehammer Games in 1994.\n\nAnd it continues Team GB's disappointing Games so far, with no medals won yet.\n\n\"I can't believe it happened,\" Fear said afterwards. \"I am replaying it in my head and it's just such a shame. I don't really have the words yet. It will take me some time to process.\"\n\nGold went to France's Guillaume Cizeron and Laurence Fournier Beaudry, who top scored across both rhythm and free dance. It is Cizeron's second successive Olympic gold after winning at Beijing 2022 with ex-partner Gabrielle Paparakis.\n\nCizeron and Fournier Beaudry have been at the centre of controversy in recent months, but have been the best couple in ice dance since partnering in November and outshone the competition in Milan.\n\nMadison Chock and Evan Bates of USA won silver, with bronze going to Canada's Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier. Fear and Gibson finished seventh.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nFear, 26, and 31-year-old Gibson were fourth after the rhythm dance – the first section of the ice dance competition - leaving them work to do. They scored 85.47 in their rhythm dance to lie behind Gilles and Poirier in third.\n\nIt meant Fear and Gibson needed to deliver a showstopping performance in their Scottish-themed free dance to earn Britain's first medal of the 2026 Winter Games.\n\nResplendent in tartan, they danced to The Bonnie Banks of Loch Lomond, Auld Lang Syne and The Proclaimers hit I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles) – in a routine they had honed with highland dance experts to perfect the choreography.\n\nAnd it started magnificently as they scored big on their complex opening, a multi-stage stationary lift.\n\nBut as they moved into their second element, sequential twizzles – a rotation while moving across the ice - Fear visibly wobbled. It meant they got a negative score on the grade of execution, a fatal blow in an Olympic final.\n\n\"It was just a really costly technical mistake, which was tough very early in the programme because I knew that we'd lost bronze at that point,\" Fear told BBC Sport.\n\n\"But I also really wanted to not let the Olympic experience just disappear because of that so it's this battle of taking it in and doing my best the rest of the way while also knowing what I'd just done.\n\n\"And it's not what we've trained, it was costly and devastating.\"\n\nThey skated clean thereafter and got good scores in their rousing finish – a series of Highland jigs combined with a dance lift - but the damage was done, as their overall technical score suffered greatly.\n\nIt was clear from their faces that they knew they had not been perfect. Fear had appeared nervous before the routine and looked devastated afterwards as it became clear that the pressure told.\n\n\"When you don't perform the way you want to, on any day, it's tough to take but at the Olympic Games, it's even harder,\" Gibson said.\n\n\"I think we'll look back at this one day and 100% learn from it. We do that at every single event that we go to and compete in. We'll just move forward.\"\n\nThe 'Disco Brits' are the darlings of British figure skating, and are popular internationally for their vibrant, skilful routines.\n\nAnd they have had an impressive year in which they became the first Brits to win a medal at a World Championship for 40 years; they also got on the podium in Sheffield at their home European Championships. But there will be no Olympic medal to round it off.\n\nBritain's other representatives Phebe Bekker and James Hernandez, who made the final stage on their Olympic debuts aged just 24 and 20 respectively, finished 17th after setting a season-best overall score of 179.45.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "title": "Frank's downfall: Inside his struggle to get players and fans onboard",
    "description": "Thomas Frank has been sacked as Tottenham manager after just eight months in charge. BBC Sport's Sami Mokbel takes a closer look at his tenure.",
    "fullText": "Tottenham's decision to sack Thomas Frank was made almost immediately after Tuesday night's loss to Newcastle.\n\nChief executive Vinai Venkatesham, in conjunction with sporting director Johan Lange, made the call - one the club had been reluctant to make.\n\nBut the sorry state of Tottenham's season meant not even Frank's biggest advocate could disagree with the decision.\n\nEarly on Wednesday morning, Venkatesham made the recommendation to the Lewis family - the club's ownership - to dispense with Frank.\n\nIn recent weeks a furious fanbase have directed their ire towards the Lewises amid a widely held belief that supporters' views about Frank were not being listened to.\n\nAccording to conversations with those closely connected with the ownership, that was not the case - and the Lewis family were attuned to the widespread discontent from Spurs fans.\n\nOf course, it would have been harder not to notice given the ferocity of ill feeling towards the Dane in recent weeks.\n\nBut given they effectively handed the running of the club to Venkatesham when appointing him chief executive last summer, it is fair to say the ownership have not sought to intervene - feeling a decision should be made 'on the ground'.\n\nSo, when the recommendation from Venkatesham to terminate Frank's employment arrived in the hours after the loss to Newcastle it was accepted immediately by the ownership board, who formally approved the decision.\n\nAll that was left was for Frank to be officially informed of his departure - a formality that took place on Wednesday morning in a meeting between the manager, Venkatesham and Lange.\n\nFrank's appointment in June was welcomed at the time as a shrewd move.\n\nHe had done a superb job at Brentford to, firstly, earn promotion from the Championship and then, crucially, consolidate their position as a Premier League club.\n\nBut he lasted just eight months at Spurs amid player indiscipline, a split executive team and doubts over his tactical approach.\n\nWhy Frank at Tottenham was a gamble that ended in bitter failure\n\nFrank sacked by Spurs after eight months in charge\n\nFrank was intent on implementing a positive culture at Tottenham - having done so at Brentford - which was one of the factors behind the decision to appoint him as Ange Postecoglou's successor.\n\nThere have been instances, however, when Frank's efforts to build respectful working conditions for his players and staff were tested.\n\nTowards the start of his reign, Frank dropped a player from Tottenham's starting XI after the squad member reported late for a pre-match meeting and then did not apologise for the indiscretion.\n\nHowever, after being removed from the team the player did later apologise.\n\nThe way Frank handled apparent threats to his authority ultimately impressed some players, who liked the fact there were consequences for below-par behaviour.\n\nAn example came when Yves Bissouma was left in London for August's Uefa Super Cup against Paris St-Germain because of persistent lateness.\n\nIn recent days, meanwhile, Frank had no intention of stripping Cristian Romero of the captaincy despite the defender's social media outbursts against the club or his red card against Manchester United.\n\nRomero is said to be more difficult to manage around the club's training centre, and it is claimed some players felt the Argentine has been afforded preferential treatment.\n\nWhen Micky van der Ven and Djed Spence appeared to refuse to shake Frank's hand after the home loss to Chelsea, the manager defused the situation by insisting the players were simply \"frustrated\" before later revealing they had apologised.\n\nThere was always a sense Frank put his players before his own agendas. Certain members of the squad certainly appreciated that.\n\nBut that is not to say he left a positive impression on all of them.\n\nIn the opening weeks of his reign, some players are believed to have found Frank indecisive.\n\nThey were used to Postecoglou's big personality - although the Australian had become increasingly isolated during his final months in charge.\n\nThere were consistent reservations about Frank's tactical approach, too: concerns he was not assertive enough in matches and was too focused on adapting to the opposition rather than imposing Spurs' own strengths.\n\nThat image of Frank will do little to dispel the narrative the Tottenham job was simply too big for him.\n\nConcerns over Frank's appointment have been lingering for months.\n\nOne leading executive recommended the Dane should be sacked after the 2-1 home defeat by Fulham on 29 November - Tottenham's third-straight loss after reversals to Arsenal and PSG.\n\nFormer Brighton head coach Roberto de Zerbi - who was managing Marseille at the time - was also pushed as a potential replacement.\n\nBut that recommendation was rejected with the club continuing to put their faith in Frank.\n\nIt is interesting that the club's leadership group, led by Venkatesham, stuck with Frank for as long as they did.\n\nThe Dane's appointment was ultimately led by Daniel Levy - Tottenham's divisive former executive chairman who unexpectedly departed after 24 years in September.\n\nWhile Venkatesham was involved in the execution of the deal that took Frank across London, the groundwork was completed in advance of the CEO joining last summer.\n\nWith Levy gone, it appeared the easiest decision for Venkatesham would be to sack Frank given the increasing vitriol towards the head coach from fans.\n\nBut for Venkatesham, it was not as simple as that, despite the fact he knew it could increase his popularity.\n\nFor starters, Lange - who played a key role in Frank's identification as a leading candidate - was a close ally of his Danish compatriot.\n\nHowever, it is also true to say Tottenham's former co-sporting director Fabio Paratici, who has since joined Fiorentina, was not overly convinced Frank was the best man for the job.\n\nBut there is also a sense during the post-Levy era at Spurs that after years of chopping and changing managers they would benefit from a period of stability.\n\nVenkatesham saw first-hand at Arsenal what sticking with a manager when there are calls for his head can do for a club in Mikel Arteta, who has since established the Gunners as one of the best teams in Europe.\n\nLikewise, there was a belief from within Tottenham's hierarchy that Frank had been dealt a rough hand given the campaign has been disrupted by injuries to key players.\n\nThere is also recognition that the squad needs repair work – particularly considering the departures of their two main sources of goals in Harry Kane and Son Heung-min.\n\nLast season's top scorer Brennan Johnson has also left - although that was down to Frank deeming the Wales attacker was no longer part of his plans.\n\nThere is also a sense Tottenham's squad is lacking in leadership. It was why they signed England midfielder Conor Gallagher and tried to land Andy Robertson - both of whom have vast Premier League experience.\n\nUltimately, the foundations of Tottenham's faith in Frank were irreparably shaken after the home loss to relegation-threatened West Ham on 17 January.\n\nSources have suggested Spurs were close to ending Frank's reign after that defeat, which was attended by members of the Lewis family - Vivienne Lewis was confronted by an irate fan after the match.\n\nChampions League victories over Borussia Dortmund and Eintracht Frankfurt bought Frank some time - but the loss to Newcastle extended Tottenham's winless league run to eight matches and proved to be the Dane's last.\n\nVenkatesham and the club's new leadership team will now be tasked with making their first appointment.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether they seek an interim manager with a view to appointing a permanent boss in the summer, or want a full-time choice immediately.\n\nThere is certainly consideration behind the scenes to the interim option given how drastically the managerial landscape will change in the summer.\n\nOne option until the end of the season could be John Heitinga, who joined Tottenham as an assistant coach last month. The former Netherlands defender managed Ajax this season and was part of Arne Slot's Premier League title-winning coaching staff at Liverpool.\n\nFor the long term, the most obvious development will be the potential availability of Mauricio Pochettino after the World Cup.\n\nThe USA head coach has made no secret of his desire to return to Tottenham one day - and supporters have made no secret of their wishes for him to return.\n\nIt seems like a perfect match. But Spurs will have to wait until after the World Cup to appoint Pochettino.\n\nEven if it is not Pochettino, the likes of Oliver Glasner, Andoni Iraola and Marco Silva will be available for nothing in the summer.\n\nOther World Cup coaches including Thomas Tuchel, Carlo Ancelotti and Julian Nagelsmann may also be obtainable.\n\nSo there is sense in buying time until the summer. Equally, however, the recent availability of De Zerbi, who left Marseille on Tuesday night, may interest Spurs.\n\nDe Zerbi is viewed as someone who can hit the ground running, a trait Tottenham could do with given their spiral towards the relegation zone.\n\nYes, he can be combustible. But if Spurs are looking for an instant impact, the Italian could fit the bill.\n\nSources are indicating Tottenham want an appointment in place by the time the players arrive back on Monday after a pre-planned five-day break.\n\nAmid on-field troubles, there have also been off-field rumours for the club's hierarchy to deal with - amid persistent rumblings Spurs could be sold.\n\nThis is despite it being reinforced to staff that Tottenham are not for sale. That correlates with public messaging despite industry rumours the Lewis family are open to selling.\n\nFormer Newcastle owner Amanda Staveley has been heavily linked with a continued interest in Tottenham despite a statement in September that she does not intend to make a formal offer for the club.\n\nOther consortiums, including groups from the USA, have also been linked with an interest in purchasing Spurs, while there were reports last week that Levy was looking at selling his stake in Tottenham after his departure.\n\nCombined with the results on the pitch and the changes off it, it has been an uncertain time.\n\nFor now though, all the attention is on the dugout and how Tottenham replace Frank.\n\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Tottenham - what do you want to know?",
