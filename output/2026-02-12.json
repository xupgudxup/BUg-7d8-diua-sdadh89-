    "fullText": "Suns’ Dillon Brooks puts refs on blast after 16th technical foul appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nPHOENIX– Dillon Brooks was more mad than anyone in the locker room ever saw him postgame. The normally laid-back, stoic forward had an intense look in his eyes and was taciturn in his responses.\n\nThey were all centered around his 16th technical. He leads the league in that category, but in his defense, referees are quicker to give Brooks a technical foul than other players.\n\nHe stated that official Jason Williams said that he was playing the victim too much, and that’s why he picked up his 16th. But he was soon asked how he handles the frustration of the officials watching every move.\n\n“Consistency,” he said vehemently. “If you’re going to be consistently bad, then be consistently bad throughout the whole game. Don’t try to fix it during the game.\n\n“Don’t be trying to do any of that or try to even out foul calls or whatever the case might be. If you’re going to be bad, be bad the whole game.”\n\nI followed up and asked Dillon Brooks how he handles his frustration when the officials perceive him the way they do.\n\n“If you’re going to be consistently bad, then be consistently bad throughout the whole game. Don’t try to fix it during the game. Don’t be trying to do any of… pic.twitter.com/oncbOjHlx8\n\n— Hayden Cilley (@HaydenCilley) February 12, 2026\n\nThe foul comes at a very crucial time. It took place during the last game before the All-Star break. Although Phoenix will look to rest up, if the foul stands, he won’t be able to play until Saturday against the Orlando Magic.\n\nAnd as the rule goes, for every other technical foul (18, 20, 22, etc.) there will be an automatic one-game suspension. With how valuable Brooks is to the Suns, there might be ways to be cautious.\n\nHe mentioned possibly not even talking to the officials at all during the game. Finding any kind of temporary solution can help with a potential playoff push.\n\nAlso with Devin Booker, Jalen Green, and the rest of the team looking to be fully healthy, every person matters, especially Brooks.\n\nPerhaps the backend of the season can entail a toned-down version of Brooks’s intensity for the sake of not picking up any more technical fouls.",

    "fullText": "The struggles Kyle Busch has faced over the last two seasons are no secret, but on Sunday, NASCAR could see him climb back atop the mountain of relevance once again. After winning the pole position for the 2026 Daytona 500, the fire in Busch appears to be reignited, and he is hungry to win.\n\nFor a while now, Busch has endured repeated setbacks with little sign of light at the end of the tunnel. However, something feels different in 2026. The veteran is clear about what he wants and why he wants it.\n\nThat clarity could end up being the engine that drives him back toward greatness once again.\n\nBusch said, after winning the Daytona 500 pole, “Seeing my son and the passion that he has, he really, really is probably my biggest cheerleader. He wants to see me run well. He wants to see me win races. He wants to celebrate in Victory Lane like he sees other drivers’ kids being able to do.\n\n“So there’s nothing more that drives me every single weekend than seeing him see me, be proud of me,” the Richard Childress Racing driver stated.\n\nBusch’s son Brexton, 10, is already following in his father’s footsteps in motorsports. He has made quite a name for himself, winning dozens of races across multiple disciplines. And what kid would not want to see his father standing atop the hill as the king? Busch appears to be using that sentiment as motivation to pull himself out of the rut he has found himself in.\n\nThe 2026 season marks Busch’s fourth year with Richard Childress Racing, and he will be supported by the talent and experience of crew chief Jim Pohlman, who won the Xfinity Series championship with JR Motorsports in 2024. Rest assured, he knows exactly what he is doing.\n\nHopefully, Brextonwill not have to wait long to celebrate with his father in Victory Lane. From the looks of it, that moment could come as early as this weekend. The two-time Cup Series champion clocked a lap of 49.006 seconds at Daytona International Speedway to win the pole position.\n\nBusch will share the front row with Joe Gibbs Racing driver Chase Briscoe. It will be his 21st career start in the Daytona 500 and his first time starting the race from the pole. The stars appear aligned for Busch’s return. All that is left to do now is go out there and execute.\n\nThe post “Nothing Drives Me More”: Kyle Busch Reveals What’s Fueling His Push to Win Again in NASCAR appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "Former Blue Jays starter Chris Bassitt agreed to terms on a one year, $18.5 million contract with the Baltimore Orioles today. Bassitt, who turns 37 next Sunday, spent the last three seasons with the Blue Jays. He was originally drafted by the White Sox, but spent the bulk of his MLB career as an Oakland A, with a one year stint with the Mets before signing in Toronto.\n\nHe was effective last season, making 31 starts and posting a 3.96 ERA over 170.1 innings. He moved to the bullpen for the playoffs, logging a 1.04 ERA over seven appearances and 8.2 innings and was a solid contributor to the World Series run. Overall, he gave the Jays 541.1 innings with a 3.89 ERA. That innings total ranks ninth in the majors over the past three seasons, while the ERA was 5% better than league average. He was exactly the kind of workhorse #3 they’d hoped for when they signed him, and it was great to have him on the team.\n\nWith the additions of Dylan Cease and Cody Ponce early in free agency, it doesn’t seem like the team was serious about bringing him back, though. With Cease, plus Kevin Gausman signed for one more year, the emergence of Trey Yesavage, and (theoretically) Shane Bieber also taking a spot, he’d have had to battle with Jose Berrios for the #5 spot even before the Ponce signing. Given his track record, it makes sense that he’d pursue a more guaranteed starting job.\n\nIt’s unfortunate for us that that job comes in Baltimore. The Orioles project to have one of the best offenses in baseball, with homegrown starts Adley Rutschman, Gunnar Henderson, and Jackson Holliday paired with free agent slugger Pete Alonso, but their rotation is a weak spot that had looked like it might keep them out of the top tier of AL contenders. Bassitt gives them a steady hand to back up the mercurial Shane Baz and the talented but often injured Trevor Rogers at the top of the rotation. He doesn’t solve a lack of top end pitching talent, and they still project behind the Yankees, Jays and Red Sox, but the gap is closed a bit and the AL East becomes even more of a gauntlet.\n\nThat aside, I wish Bassitt well. He was a great addition to the team while he was here, and seemed pretty likeable. I hope he pitches well enough to be traded to a contender in the NL at the deadline.",

    "fullText": "Follow our live coverage of the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nChloe Kim, the snowboarder who has been setting the bar high over the years, will attempt her third gold medal on Thursday in hopes of continuing her strong legacy. The U.S. and Canadian hockey teams will take the ice indoors as the men begin their tournaments and return to Olympic action for the first time since 2014.\n\nWhile Norway leads the gold medal count with seven of the 13, the United States is up to four gold medals (seven total) so far in Italy, and will have several opportunities to add to that count on Day 6 of the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nLet’s take a look at everything to watch today.\n\nTime: 7 a.m. ET, 1 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: The women’s 10km interval start freestyle brings another good chance for Diggins, the American star in her final season, to win a medal. She has several World Cup wins over 10 kilometers and was the world champion in 2023.\n\nTime: Canada at 10:40 a.m. ET, 4:40 p.m. in Italy; U.S. at 3:10 p.m. ET, 9:10 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: American and Canadian NHL stars return to the Olympic ice for the first time since the 2014 Sochi Games. Canada opens against the Czech Republic, also known as Czechia, while the U.S. takes on Latvia in the nightcap. Two other games Thursday: Switzerland-France at 6:10 a.m. ET and Germany-Denmark at 3:10 p.m. ET.\n\nTime: 1:30 p.m. ET, 7:30 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: Kim will be chasing a third gold medal, and the competition will be chasing her. The key question will be whether she lands her most technically ambitious runs under Olympic pressure and how close the field can push her to perform at her best, as riders attempt to shorten the gap. Even when Kim isn’t perfect, her scoring ceiling often forces competitors to take bigger risks, setting up a final that could hinge on execution and nerve as much as difficulty.\n\nTimes: 3:05 a.m. (women), 8:05 a.m. (men) and 1:05 p.m. (women) ET; 9:05 a.m., 2:05 p.m. and 7:05 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: The U.S. and Canada women make their debut in the morning session. The Americans are up again in the evening session. Great Britain vs. Sweden highlights the afternoon men’s session.\n\nTimes: 3:30 a.m. ET; 9:30 a.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: The opening two heats will set the tone for a race where hundredths of a second can define medal hopes. With athletes making their first Olympic runs down the track, early consistency and clean starts will be crucial, especially as sliders balance aggression with control on one of the fastest courses in the world. Pressure will likely be on medal favorites to avoid mistakes while leaving little margin for recovery heading into the final runs, as Heats 1 and 2 will separate the good and great.\n\nTimes: Qualification No. 2 at 4 a.m. ET, 10 a.m. in Italy; final at 6:15 a.m. ET, 12:15 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: Demanding combinations of speed, aerial difficulty and technical precision will be tested as qualifiers kick off. The event rewards skiers who can maintain clean, controlled turns while attacking the course with aggression and executing high-difficulty jumps, so expect the competition to hinge on how athletes balance speed with form, as even small mistakes in the bumps or landings can swing scores dramatically. With judging split among turns, air and time, the event often produces tight finishes and momentum swings as finalists try to deliver high-risk runs under pressure.\n\nTimes: Qualification at 4 a.m. ET, 10 a.m. in Italy; final at 7:45 a.m. ET, 1:45 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: Strategy, positioning and clean starts are often just as important as raw speed, as riders jostle for lanes and try to avoid crashes that can quickly eliminate medal favorites. The knockout format adds another layer of pressure, forcing competitors to balance aggression with control while navigating traffic at high speeds, making snowboard cross one of the Games’ most volatile and dramatic events. Keep an eye on USA’s Nick Baumgartner, Australia’s Adam Lambert, Austria’s Alessandro Hämmerle and Canada’s Éliot Grondin.\n\nTime: 10:30 a.m. ET, 4:30 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: Norway’s Ragne Wiklund, Canada’s Isabelle Weidemann and Joy Beune of the Netherlands are among the best in the women’s long-distance race. Italy’s Francesca Lollobrigida is the reigning world champion, giving the host nation a medal hopeful. Dutch great Irene Schouten, the defending Olympic champion, has since retired.\n\nTime: 12:30 p.m. ET, 6:30 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: Germany and Austria lead the field after strong individual results, but one misstep or sloppy transition can swing the podium. Keep an eye on Germany and Austria’s consistency, which earned them a lead so far. Star power and making every run and handoff will be critical, but they won’t necessarily carry each team to victory.\n\nTime: 2:15 p.m. ET, 8:15 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: It could be a big day for North America here, with Americans Corinne Stoddard and Kristen Santos-Griswold and Canadians William Dandjinou, Steven Dubois and Courtney Sarault all among the medal contenders. Pietro Sighel gives Italy a medal shot in the men’s 1,000. Two-time world champion Xandra Velzeboer of the Netherlands is the name to beat in the women’s 500.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nOlympics, Global Sports, Women's Olympics\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "One man’s trash is another man’s treasure. Just ask Endrick Felipe Moreira de Sousa.\n\nBorn in Taguatinga, Brazil, Endrick moved to Palmeiras’ academy at a young age, where he rose through the ranks and single-handedly lifted his family out of poverty. After scoring 165 goals in 169 games for Palmeiras youth teams, Endrick ascended to the first team and established himself as one of the best talents in world football, scoring 21 goals in 82 appearances for the Verdão and leading them to two league titles.\n\nRead the full article by subscribing to Ensemble PSG on Substack\n\nIt wasn’t long before the likes of Gabriele Marcotti were starting to describe him as a future world-beater, and it’s why Real Madrid snapped him up for an initial fee of €35 million, plus €25 million add-ons and €12 million in taxes. By the time he joined, he was already a full-fledged international for Brazil’s senior team and a strong contender for the team’s starting center forward position.\n\nAfter arriving in the summer of 2024 following his 18th birthday, Endrick made a swift transition to life in Spain, becoming the youngest foreigner to score for the club in La Liga’s history (aged 18 years and 35 days) and the youngest player to score for Real Madrid in the UEFA Champions League, as well as the first player since Cristiano Ronaldo in the 2012–13 season to score five goals in a single Copa del Rey campaign for Real Madrid.\n\nUnfortunately for Endrick, he missed out on the FIFA Club World Cup after suffering a hamstring injury, prompting him to miss out on the first few weeks of the Xabi Alonso era. While Gonzalo García exploited the opportunity and finished as the tournament’s top scorer, Endrick returned as the club’s third-choice striker.",

    "fullText": "The Arizona Cardinals made Mike LaFLeur their new head coach. While it took a while, it has largely been looked at positively. It is seen largely as a solid hire, as it seems that anyone who has ever worked for Rams head coach Sean McVay has success.\n\nHowever, if one report is true, LaFleur was not the guy the Cardinals really wanted.\n\nAccording to Jason La Canfora, the Cardinals badly wanted to hire Klint Kubiak, now the head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders after he was the offensive coordinator for the Seattle Seahawks, the newly crowned world champions.\n\nThe Cardinals were willing to wait and were ready to open up the pocketbook and pay him. It wasn't enough, though.\n\nArizona was incredibly high on Kubiak, and, like the Raiders, were willing to wait until after the Super Bowl to hire him. The franchise, notorious for being beyond frugal when it comes to coaching expenditures, were also willing to make a significant allotment to his salary and his assistants, but Kubiak chose the Raiders instead, a decision that was not particularly difficult, according to some involved in the process.\n\nWhy the Raiders? Minority owner Tom Brady was a factor. So was having the first overall pick in the 2026 draft. And another factor was being able to get out of the NFC West.\n\nWhile this report doesn't come from a large outlet, this would explain the Cardinals' process. They interviewed LaFleur but really wanted to speak with Kubiak, seemingly hoping to sway him their way.\n\nWhile it seemed like the whole world knew Kubiak wanted the Raiders' job, the Cardinals wanted to shoot their shot, ultimately failing.\n\nThis isn't to say that LaFleur won't work out. The Cardinals just wanted Kubiak more.\n\nNow we will see which coach is able to turn things around better and more quickly.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "Dillon Brooks gets honest about his relationship with referees 'Said I'm playing victim' originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThroughout his career, Phoenix Suns forward Dillon Brooks has had a rocky relationship with the referees. He is the type of player who loves talking trash to his opponents because that is just how his personality is. Brooks loves throwing his opponents off their game, but he gets penalized for it often.\n\nAgainst the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday, the Suns lost the game 136-109. Brooks had a decent performance, scoring 23 points, grabbing five rebounds, and dishing out four assists. Unfortunately, he was called for his 16th technical foul, which will result in a one-game suspension.\n\nUnfortunately for Brooks, he has a reputation with the referees. That has followed him throughout his career, which led to him clashing with the officials. On Wednesday, it was referee James Williams, who has become widely known around the league as the Gucci Mane lookalike.\n\nDuring the game, Williams gave Brooks a technical foul, which was his 16th of the season. That means he won't be present in the Suns' next game against the San Antonio Spurs on the second night of a back-to-back.\n\nMORE: Dillon Brooks receives support from teammate for All-Star push after recent performances\n\nBrooks dislikes his relationship with referees because he feels he is getting picked on now. It is not a good thing that he keeps picking up technical fouls, but sometimes, Brooks knows that it is more of his reputation doing the work, and not something he did on the court.\n\n\"Focus on the game. He said I'm playing victim all the time. When I don't play the victim, I'm a bad guy. Choose one... We haven't won a game with Gucci reffing... that should be on notice... We've had him 4-5 times already,\" Brooks said about his relationship with referee Williams.\n\nIt is not a good look for Brooks, but if he is telling the truth, reputation does play a big role for these players. Despite Brooks standing out as one of the breakout stars of the season, he continues to retain his reputation. Unfortunately, that will affect the Suns, as they look to win more games.\n\nKnicks, Suns inquired about Spurs' Jeremy Sochan at trade deadline\n\nSuns owner Matt Ishbia fires back at Bill Simmons over prediction\n\nSuns' Devin Booker gets 'one of the best players in the world' praise from NBA legend\n\nDillon Brooks calls out Draymond Green and Paul George for podcasts while still in the NBA\n\nDraymond Green takes another swipe at Dillon Brooks",

    "title": "The WSL2 January Transfer Window: A Tale of Contrasts, Caution and Ambition",
    "description": "“The hope, then, is that Sunderland Women’s long‑term vision will eventually align with the ambition of its supporters”, writes Charlotte Patterson.",
    "fullText": "The January transfer window in the WSL and WSL2 is rarely a quiet affair, but this year’s edition felt especially revealing. It exposed the widening gap between clubs with resources to reshape their squads mid‑season and those who must operate with caution, creativity, and a heavy reliance on internal development. It also highlighted the shifting ambitions across the division, with some sides aggressively strengthening for promotion pushes or survival battles, while others, notably Sunderland, opted for a more restrained approach that has left supporters both understanding and quietly frustrated.\n\nThe WSL2 is a league defined by its contradictions: home to clubs with Premier League backing and others reliant on community‑driven models; a division where ambition often outstrips budget. The January window, then, becomes a mirror, reflecting not only squad needs but also the structural realities each club faces.\n\nSo let us explore each team’s business, the motivations behind their moves, and the broader patterns emerging across the league. Then turn to Sunderland: our limited activity, the reliance on loans, the understandable but still disappointing lack of permanent additions, and the unavoidable comparison with Newcastle’s headline‑grabbing recruitment drive. It asks the question many Sunderland supporters have quietly pondered: could more have been done? And if not, what does that say about the club’s ambition for its women’s side?\n\nFew clubs approached the window with as much intent as Birmingham City. Their business was extensive, ambitious, and clearly designed to elevate the squad for the second half of the season. The arrivals of Asato Miyagawa from Hammarby and Michaela Kovacs from Vålerenga added international pedigree and defensive solidity, while Wilma Leidhammar from IFK Norrköping brought attacking threat and versatility. Hannah Silcock from Liverpool strengthened the midfield, and Lotta Lindström from London City added further depth.\n\nShanade Hopcroft’s arrival from Crystal Palace was one of the more intriguing moves of the window, offering creativity and WSL2 experience. Birmingham’s recruitment strategy was clear: build a squad capable of competing at the very top of the division, with a blend of youth, experience, and international quality.\n\nTheir outgoings were equally notable. Ebonie Locke, Poppy Irvine, Tegan McGowan, Ava Baker, Lily Agg and Riya Mannu all departed, either permanently or on loan, as Birmingham reshaped their squad with purpose. This was a club making a statement, one that suggested they see themselves not merely as contenders, but as a side determined to return to the WSL.\n\nBristol City’s window was defined by quality rather than quantity. Katie Robinson’s arrival from Aston Villa was a standout signing, bringing pace, directness, and top‑flight experience. Lauren Brzykcy from Piteå and Oliwia Woś from Nürnberg added defensive stability, while Camila Sáez from West Ham strengthened the spine of the team. Jessie Gale from Arsenal rounded out a window that felt measured, intelligent, and aligned with Bristol’s long‑term vision.\n\nTheir outgoings, Tianna Teisar and Malaika Meena, were modest in comparison, suggesting a club that feels confident in its direction and sought only to refine, not overhaul.\n\nCharlton have been one of the Championship’s more ambitious sides in recent seasons, and their January business reflected that. Katie Lockwood from Glasgow City and Lizzie Waldie from Hearts added experience and leadership.\n\nThe departure of Zoe Barratt to AFC Bournemouth was the only significant outgoing, leaving Charlton with a strengthened, more balanced squad. Their recruitment was purposeful, reinforcing their status as a club with genuine promotion aspirations.\n\nCrystal Palace’s window was one of the most eye‑catching in the division. Hayley Ladd’s arrival from Everton was a major coup, a player with WSL pedigree, leadership qualities, and the ability to control games from midfield. Kelly Brady from Athlone Town and Lucy Newell from Manchester United added depth and versatility across the pitch.\n\nShanade Hopcroft’s departure to Birmingham and Isabella Sibley’s arrival at IFK Norrkoping did raise eyebrows.\n\nDurham’s window was quiet but defined by targeted, sensible additions. Dee Bradley from Burnley added defensive steel. Lily Agg’s arrival from Birmingham provided experience and composure in midfield.\n\nDurham rarely overhaul their squad mid‑season, preferring continuity and cohesion, and their January business reflected that philosophy. It was understated but effective, the kind of window that strengthens a squad without disrupting its identity.\n\nIpswich were one of the busiest clubs in the division, and their window reflected a club determined to establish itself at WSL2level. Colette Cavanagh from Deportivo, Lucy Ashworth‑Clifford from Lazio, and Lysianne Proulx from Juventus were headline arrivals, bringing international experience and technical quality.\n\nKit Graham from Tottenham, Kenzie Weir from Everton, and Ava Baker from Birmingham added depth and versatility, while Nelly Las from Leicester and Malaika Meena from Bristol City strengthened the midfield. Princess Ademiluyi from Gotham FC was one of the more exciting signings, offering pace and unpredictability.\n\nTheir academy‑focused additions, Nina Meollo and Ruby Seaby, reflected Ipswich’s commitment to youth development. This was a window that blended ambition with identity, positioning Ipswich as a club determined not to go back down.\n\nNewcastle’s window was, unsurprisingly, the most dramatic in the division. Their recruitment was loud, ambitious, and financially assertive, a reflection of a club with Premier League backing and a clear desire to climb the women’s football pyramid quickly.\n\nKaitlyn Torpey from Portland Thorns, Emilia Larsson from Rosengård, and Simone Charley from Orlando Pride were marquee arrivals, bringing international pedigree and attacking firepower as well as, Ashanti Akpan from Southampton.\n\nNewcastle’s business was not subtle. It was a statement of intent, a declaration that they intend to challenge for promotion immediately. Their window stood in stark contrast to many of their WSL2 rivals and, inevitably, to Sunderland.\n\nForest’s window was one of the most intriguing. Libby Smith, Joy Omewa, Alana Murphy, Leanne Kiernan, Rebekah Dowsett, Cerys Brown, and Olivia Johnson all arrived, giving Forest one of the most extensive recruitment drives in the division.\n\nTheir outgoings, Caragh Hamilton to Sunderland and Casey Howe to Wolves, were notable, but Forest’s overall business suggested a club intent on consolidating and climbing the table. Their recruitment blended experience, youth, and international talent, positioning them as one of the window’s most active and ambitious sides.\n\nPortsmouth’s window was modest but purposeful. Charlie Estcourt last at DC Power and Lucy Shepherd from Dallas Trinity added attacking options, while academy development registrations for Niamh Peacock and Evie Milner reflected a commitment to youth.\n\nPortsmouth’s business was not headline‑grabbing, but it was coherent, the kind of window that strengthens a squad without overstretching. Especially as they fight to survive.\n\nSheffield United made two key additions: Simone Sherwood from Leicester and Tammi George from Wolves. Both signings added depth and experience, particularly in midfield and defence. They also added loan signings in Scarlett Hill from Manchester United and Shauna Guyatt from Ipswich Town. It was a quiet window, but one that addressed specific needs.\n\nSouthampton’s window was defined by only one arrival: Tegan McGowan from Birmingham City. A player who brings energy and technical quality, strengthening a squad that has been steadily building over the past two seasons.\n\nSouthampton’s recruitment reflected a club with growing ambition, one that sees itself as capable of challenging the established order.\n\nAnd then we come to Sunderland, a club whose January window has sparked more debate, frustration, and introspection than perhaps any other in the WSL2.\n\nSunderland’s business consisted of two loan signings: Mared Griffiths from Manchester United and Caragh Hamilton from Nottingham Forest. Both are talented players, both will contribute, and both fit the club’s long‑standing philosophy of promoting youth, developing talent, and operating sustainably.\n\nBut it is also fair, and entirely human, to feel a sense of disappointment.\n\nWhen other clubs around you are making permanent additions, strengthening decisively, and generating excitement among their supporters, it becomes difficult not to compare. And when that comparison includes Newcastle, the contrast becomes even starker.\n\nNewcastle’s window was a spectacle. Sunderland’s was quiet.\n\nNewcastle’s business was a statement. Sunderland’s was pragmatic.\n\nNewcastle’s ambition was visible. Sunderland’s was implied, internal, and, to many supporters, insufficiently expressed.\n\nThe question many Sunderland supporters have asked is simple: could we not have brought in someone else? Someone permanent? Someone who could change games?\n\nGiven Sunderland’s position in the league, competitive, ambitious, and within touching distance of something meaningful but also something catastrophic, it would not have been unreasonable to expect at least one marquee addition. A creative midfielder. A clinical forward. A defender with top‑flight experience. A player who could turn tight games in Sunderland’s favour.\n\nBut football is rarely that straightforward. It is entirely possible, even likely, that Sunderland were in talks with players. Negotiations may have taken place. Targets may have been identified. Deals may have been close. But for whatever reason, finances, competition, timing, player preference, they could not get them over the line.\n\nThis is the reality of operating in a league where resources vary dramatically. Sunderland’s model prioritises sustainability, internal development, and long‑term planning. It is a model that has produced results, but it is also one that can feel limiting during transfer windows, especially when rivals are making bold moves.\n\nThere is also the broader, more uncomfortable question: does the club match the ambition of its supporters when it comes to the women’s team?\n\nSunderland’s women’s side has enormous potential, a rich history, and a passionate fanbase. But potential alone does not win promotions, and passion alone does not sign players. The reliance on loans, while useful, does not build long‑term squad stability. It fills gaps but does not lay foundations.\n\nAnd while promoting from within is admirable, and something Sunderland do exceptionally well, and I myself personally am proud of and love to see, it cannot be the only strategy if the club wants to compete with the likes of Newcastle, Birmingham, or Charlton.\n\nThe frustration, then, is not rooted in entitlement but in aspiration. Sunderland supporters know what this club can be. They know the talent within the squad. They know the potential of the academy. They know the passion of the fanbase. And they want the club’s ambition to match that potential.\n\nThis January window, unfortunately, did not feel like a step in that direction.\n\nThe WSL2 is evolving. Clubs are investing more, the standard is rising, and the gap between the top and bottom is widening. Ambition is becoming a competitive advantage, and those who invest wisely are reaping the rewards.\n\nSunderland are at a crossroads. Their identity as a club that develops young talent is a strength, but it must be complemented by strategic recruitment if they are to keep pace with the division’s most ambitious sides. The January window highlighted this tension: the desire to remain sustainable versus the need to be competitive.\n\nIt is entirely possible that Sunderland will still achieve their goals this season. The squad is talented, cohesive, and well‑coached. But the window was a missed opportunity to add that extra spark, that game‑changer, that player who could turn draws into wins and narrow losses into points gained.\n\nThe 2025/26 January transfer window in the WSL2 told a story of ambition, caution, and contrast. Some clubs strengthened boldly, others quietly, and a few, like Sunderland, left supporters with mixed emotions.\n\nIt is not unreasonable to feel disappointed. It is not unreasonable to compare. And it is not unreasonable to want more for a club with Sunderland’s history, potential, and identity.\n\nBut it is also important to acknowledge the complexities behind the scenes. Deals fall through. Budgets are finite. Philosophies shape decisions. And sometimes, the moves you want to make simply cannot be made.\n\nThe hope, then, is that Sunderland’s long‑term vision will eventually align with the ambition of its supporters. That the club will invest not just in its academy but in its first team. That future windows will bring not just loans but permanent additions. And that Sunderland will take their place among the WSL2’s most ambitious clubs, not just in spirit, but in action.\n\nFor now, the season continues. The squad remains strong. The potential remains enormous. And the story of Sunderland’s ambition is still being written.",

    "fullText": "It’s fair to say that Brobbey was absolutely marshalled out of the game by Liverpool’s centre-halves yesterday. He’s often a huge source of attacking intent and influence for the team but wasn’t able to get a foothold in the game against two players in Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté who neutralised his main qualities in a way we hadn’t seen up until now. Van Dijk may get more of the headlines due to his decisive goal but Konaté’s display was absolutely immense throughout. The block he made for Brobbey’s shot in the first half and the tackle he managed as Brobbey looked to get free in the box were examples of elite defending from a player who has struggled massively at points this year. It’s a shame that he decided that he wanted to elevate his levels to unplayable heights when visiting the Stadium of Light but sometimes that’s just what top players do.\n\nI thought that Brobbey’s overall performance was still at a reasonable level yesterday which further highlights how impressive the two big lumps at the heart of Liverpool’s defence were. Van Dijk was imperious in the air at both ends of the pitch, too, resulting in the aforementioned winner — something which we haven’t seen too much this year, especially when Ballard is on the pitch. I believe that VVD is the only player in the league to outperform Ballard on aerial statistics this season and he demonstrated that prowess fully.\n\nA real lack of attacking quality\n\nI think the quality on the pitch was sorely lacking from a Sunderland perspective yesterday, unfortunately. The lads put a lot of heart and effort into the performance overall but the gulf in quality was evident on the night, with Liverpool’s players frankly able to outplay ours in nearly every position. I don’t think that the performance deserves outright criticism but I do think that it was a disappointment to not push Liverpool any further than we did. It seemed like a very easy night for them, which is not something many of our opponents would be used to thinking this season, especially after coming to the SoL. As always, Enzo was at the heart of anything positive that we managed to knit together, and I felt that the performance was generally solid for a good portion of the game without ever looking threatening.\n\nThere was a real lack of incisiveness about the lads’ play across the 90 yesterday wherein opportunities to try an ambitious flick or touch, or simply to try a more difficult pass through the lines were consistently turned down in favour of playing the safe option around our own defence without much intent or endeavour. It’s something we’ve seen often in away performances recently but it seemed to seep into our home performance yesterday — to sum it up: flat.\n\nThe unbeaten record falls to the reds\n\nWell, there it goes. It was a record that we can all be immensely proud of the lads for achieving and it’s something we could never have expected to have at this stage of the season. The team had earned that record through a lot of hard work and graft, representing the badge like we’d hoped a team would for years and years. The fact that the streak is over doesn’t make us a bad team and doesn’t mean that the Stadium of Light will be an easy place for teams to come in the future — I have a lot of faith that our home form can drive us throughout the rest of the campaign.\n\nIt’s worth remembering that Liverpool are the reigning champions of the league and while they haven’t been at their scintillating best throughout the entire season, they showed that they can still be excellent on their day.\n\nOne positive coming out of the defeat was the debut of our newest tricky winger in Nilson Angulo. Starting in what seems to be his favoured position off the left, he offered much more in a 1v1 sense than I think any other winger has this season. He’s clearly got quick feet but also has a raw power and athleticism which both impressed me in the moment and makes me think that he could definitely have a great impact going forward. There were multiple occasions where Angulo was doubled up on and through his own feints and movement made it into a promising move, often taking the second defender out of the equation while at it.\n\nAnother aspect of Angulo’s play which was highlighted ahead of his arrival was his defensive work rate which was on display tonight. Despite Liverpool’s ability to carve open good opportunities concerningly easily across the night, Angulo found himself helping out Reinildo a lot on that left-hand side against Salah, helping to double up in defence and blocking crosses into the box. It’s something that Régis will clearly have enjoyed and a trait which will certainly improve his chances of keeping his place in the starting XI.\n\nIt’s not something I like to dwell on too much, but Xhaka’s influence was sorely missed yesterday. That lack of drive and intensity going into the latter stages yesterday was not seen while he was on the pitch throughout a season filled with comebacks at home. Oftentimes, Xhaka is at the core of that late push — a mentality that is difficult to replicate and drum up in his absence. Our entire system, especially when chasing a game, relies on Xhaka playing that pivot role perfectly as we sweep from left to right in order to find a punishing gap. The second balls were lost constantly yesterday, and it meant we just couldn’t build up an imposing momentum against Liverpool, who sat in safely before managing the quick and threatening counters that we couldn’t when they had dominated us.\n\nIt seems like Granit will be out for around another three weeks and with him likely needing to rebuild his fitness, we’ll have to find a way to regain that intensity when finding ourselves behind.\n\nSomething that may have gone slightly under the radar towards the end of the game was Alderete’s injury and subsequent replacement by Geertruida. He is our only left-sided centre-half, providing a hugely important balance to our play. We don’t know the extent of the injury so I’m hoping that it was something of a precautionary move to take him off (something we saw with Sadiki at the weekend), but it’s something to keep an eye on over the next few days.",

    "fullText": "A fitting tribute to lifelong supporter George, both on 26 minutes and at half-time. I Couldn’t Get A Ticket For The Game. A lovely sentiment and tribute. Sunderland ‘Til I Die — never a truer word.\n\nA bright star in a mostly mundane performance. His talent shone through when many others were uninspiring.\n\nThe crowd were up for the match, but for most of the first half the lads gave them nothing to shout about. If someone had told me it was a master plan to go 1-0 behind in that opening half — I would have believed them. We stood off and didn’t push, and showed them far too much respect. It was only my belief that RLB always has a plan that stopped me pulling what little hair I have left out! Very frustrating, and we should have been behind at the interval. It was good fortune mixed with some solid blocking which kept us in it.\n\nThere was a peculiar lack of urgency for much of the game, which I couldn’t quite fathom. Even Roefs in goal seemed to take an age to release the ball or kick downfield. His distribution was much quicker at the start of the season. A great season it’s been, and no disgrace to lose to Liverpool, but I wished we’d shown more tonight. Disappointing.\n\nMaking his full debut tonight, Nilson Angulo took a little time to get settled but looked a real threat once he got going in the second half. The young winger looked a box of tricks and I counted three nutmegs from my perfect view in front of him during the second half.\n\nDespite it coming to an end, to have waited until mid-February to leave my first home match after a loss is an outstanding achievement. On another day that header goes wide and we draw 0-0 against the current Champions. To have performed as well as we have at home is nothing short of spectacular and something we’ll look back on in the future as a real special run.\n\nDespite looking like some weeks it works well, when it doesn’t it makes our build-up look clunky and Hume’s positioning is great for a low-block but offers little in transition. With Oxford coming up a change back to traditional wingers might be a welcome breath of fresh air.\n\nWith Alderete our only left-sided central defender, hearts will be in mouths that his injury isn’t too serious; however it might provide him with a much-needed break after a few weeks slightly off the boil. With Geertruida knocking on the door for a place we may see an opportunity for him to cement his name on the team sheet either at right-back or in the centre of defence going forward.\n\nOur new signing showed flashes of his quality throughout. With a sure first touch, an eye for a pass and confident on the ball, Angulo made some skilful, driving runs at the Liverpool defence. An end product was lacking, but plenty of signs of good things to come from our new man.\n\nLiverpool probably deserved their win given the chances they created, but we gave a good account of ourselves against the current English champions. Had we made better decisions in the final third, we would have been worthy of rescuing a point and maintaining our unbeaten home record. That record has now gone, but to lose it in mid-February against Liverpool is a remarkable achievement really.\n\nSome big performances by some but not enough\n\nI thought both Robin Roefs and Dan Ballard were fantastic in keeping Liverpool at bay; both were very commanding in their respective roles. However, a few of our Lads weren’t quite at their best. Trai Hume struggled defensively, Ronaldo showed his petulant side while Alderete’s dip in form continued. Could this be fatigue due to a lack of rotation and the number of games catching up with us?\n\nWe had over 47,000 in the ground on a cold, wet night, but for whatever reason, I felt the atmosphere was a bit quieter than it has been on previously this season. The late kick-off and the weather didn’t help, but I hope the SoL is bouncing again when we take on Fulham in our next home game.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea are reportedly set to challenge Bayern Munich for the signing of Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen.\n\nThis one will have Chelsea fans laughing right away, because it is yet another Brighton player they are being linked with!\n\nObviously with sporting director Paul Winstanley, who seems to have all the power at the club, being an ex-Brighton staff member, a lot of their new signings and staff members have come from this club over recent times.\n\nAnd now, it looks like they might be looking at signing yet another player from the Premier League club, although I’m not sure I see too much in this one personally.\n\nBart Verbruggen in action for Brighton against Chelsea. (Photo by Mike Hewitt/Getty Images)\n\nChelsea are gearing up to challenge Bayern Munich for the signing of Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen and crucially.\n\nAccording to a report from TEAMtalk this week, The Blues are prepared to match the Seagulls’ £50million tag.\n\nThe report also claims that Paul Winstanley and head of global goalkeeping Ben Roberts both carried out extensive work on Verbruggen during their time at Brighton.\n\nBrighton would demand in excess of £50million for Verbruggen, a figure Chelsea are apparently prepared to negotiate with.\n\nNicolas Jackson is not having a great time in Bayern Munich at the moment, only playing a bit-part role there out on loan. He was even left out of the latest match day squad for them yesterday, signalling a sign that actually, they don’t even rate him that highly and he will not be staying there beyond the summer.\n\nIt looks like we might finally see defender Mamadou Sarr in action on Friday night since his return to the club in the January window. Sarr is expected to either start or play some minutes in the FA Cup game vs Hull City!",

He is a player who has given us a lot. In his first year here, with Xavi, he played a lot of games and was key in the league he won. He is a player of a very high level,” he told Sport.\n\n“However, it is true that in recent years he has been very conditioned by injuries. The idea this season was to analyse their situation and, from there, decide how to proceed. The injury is a little ahead of that decision.\n\n“We don’t want to leave the player in a complicated situation, because we believe that he will hardly be able to play between now and the end of the season.\n\n“Therefore, the idea is to offer him something compatible, which we believe is fair. From there, the player is free to make decisions. He is not obliged to stay at Barça, but we are going to try, at least, that he has an offer on the table, that he can evaluate it and then decide what he considers best for his future.”\n\nChristensen has said publicly that he wants to stay at Barcelona and that “he doesn’t have a Plan B” which suggests he’s likely to accept any offer that Barcelona make this summer.",

Moore Complex in Clearwater, Florida, 14 games will be ranked vs. ranked in the tournament that usually sets the tone for the season for many of the top teams in the nation.\n\nThis year's field features three of the eight teams that reached the 2025 WCWS ― Tennessee, Texas Tech and UCLA, and seven of the top 16 seeded teams in the NCAA Tournament. The Red Raiders finished as the 2025 runner-ups to Texas.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the 2026 Clearwater Invitational, including top games to watch and a full schedule:\n\nTV channel/Streaming: ESPN2 (Fubo)\n\nThe Clearwater Invitational kicks off with an exciting matchup between two top-12-ranked teams. LSU is off to a 6-0 start, while Nebraska is 3-2 with losses to Texas and Washington in the opening weekend.\n\nTV channel/Streaming: ESPN2 (Fubo)\n\nThe third game of the invitational sets up a rematch from the Lubbock Super Regional, where FSU was stifled by NiJaree Canady.

However, \"Appendix G\" saved the Bruins.\n\nHow can you not be romantic about softball? The nightcap of the Valentine's Day slate concludes with a top-10 matchup between UCLA and FSU.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOn Thursday, Team USA hockey begins its quest for gold, looking to bring home the medal for the first time since 1980.\n\nAs NHL players make their return to the Olympics for the first time since 2014, the U.S. has one of the most talented rosters it's ever assembled. Mike Sullivan's team has talent, scoring depth, elite goaltending and guys that will do the dirty work needed to go through a long stretch. Now, it's time for the squad to prove how far U.S. hockey has come.\n\nThe journey starts against Latvia, a team that isn't projected to finish high in the tournament. But, the team might be overlooked; with six NHL players on the roster and a potential top-10 pick in the 2026 NHL Draft. Moreover, there is recent history with these teams, with Latvia defeating the U.S. in the 2023 IIHF World Championship third-place game to claim their first ever medal in major men's hockey.\n\nBoth teams have a chance to start something special in Milan on Thursday. For the U.S., it can propel a run to the gold medal, and for Latvia, it would be one of the biggest upsets in history to continue the rise of Latvian hockey.\n\nHere's where you can find the contest on television and streaming.\n\nMORE 2026 OLYMPICS: Live medal tracker | Viewer's guide | Day-by-day schedule\n\nTeam USA's first game against Latvia will be broadcast nationally on USA Network. Those looking to live stream the game can via Peacock, which serves as the streaming home of the Games.\n\nPeacock will carry every event of the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics live. The NBC-owned streaming service's sports programming features live coverage of NFL Sunday Night Football, the NBA, the Olympic and Paralympic Games, Premier League soccer, Big Ten football and basketball, Notre Dame football, Big East and Big 12 basketball, PGA Tour golf, and more.\n\nBoth teams' Olympic campaigns start on Thursday, Feb. 12 at 3:10 p.m.\n\nIt is being held at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena in Milan, Italy, which is the centerpiece for the tournament.\n\nTeam USA enters Group C of the 2026 Winter Olympics as a heavy favorite. All of their preliminary round games follow a consistent schedule for fans in the United States, with puck drop set for 3:10 PM ET.\n\nIf Team USA wins their group or finishes as the top second-place team, they will likely bypass the Qualification Playoff and head straight to the Quarterfinals.",

And while Paul will be watching from his native Cornwall, he was keen to send a good luck message.\n\n\"It's going to be a big game, no doubt about that,\" he said. \"To the boys I would say, stay calm, your game is good, back it. You know your game, stick to your game and you have every chance of winning.\"\n\nPaul described how much the game had changed over the past 70 years.\n\nHe recalled travelling to Hull with his wife to join the club in 1958 after playing rugby union for Cornish sides and the RAF.\n\n\"Rovers signed us and they arranged for us to stay in an apartment over this wet fish shop, which was fine,\" he said.\n\n\"We were there for maybe a couple of months, but the problem was everything we wore smelt of fish and this led to certain family problems.\"\n\nAfter scoring five tries in a match in 1961, he was given the nickname the Cornish Express by the newspapers.\n\nHe bought a house in the city and spent six seasons at Craven Park, playing 197 games and scoring 116 tries, before returning home to Cornwall.\n\nPaul said that he never took his place in the team for granted.\n\n\"The team was selected by the directors, probably given to them by the coach, and that was published in the Hull Daily Mail on Wednesday mornings,\" he said.\n\n\"Every Wednesday morning I bought a Hull Daily Mail to check that I was playing at the weekend.\"\n\nHe still follows the Robins, watching as many games as he can on television, and is very proud of them winning three trophies last season.\n\n\"Hull KR have had a few difficult years,\" he said.\n\n\"They've struggled as a Yorkshire club against the Lancashire clubs. You had the likes of Wigan and St Helens who have dominated the game.\n\n\"And now, almost out of the blue, Hull KR have come bursting through and won everything.\"\n\nAhead of the World Club Challenge match kicking off, BBC Radio Humberside is organising a relay to carry a ball from Hull KR's home at Craven Park across the city to the MKM Stadium, where the match will be played.\n\nListen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.\n\nDownload the BBC News app from the App Store for iPhone and iPad or Google Play for Android devices\n\nFans wanted for World Club Challenge relay\n\nHull KR sell out rival's stadium in record time\n\nWorld Club Challenge returns with Hull KR v Broncos",

    "fullText": "Many of us are keen to forget hours spent running around muddy fields as part of cross country. But, as the National Championships return to north-east England for the first time in more than 10 years, amateur runners are excited to get on that start line - and cannot believe they have overcome the trauma from their school days.\n\nSam Harrison, 34, says cross country used to be the \"worst time of the week\".\n\n\"Once I'd done it at school, I thought 'I'm never doing that again'.\"\n\nHarrison did not fully commit to running until he was about 26 and was forced to give up football following three knee operations.\n\nHis dad had been running since he was 18 and was a member of Saltwell Harriers, in Gateshead, and suggested he joined too so that he would have a new outlet.\n\nLike many others, Harrison stuck to road running before the club floated the prospect of cross country.\n\n\"I had all those memories of it but then when I started hearing everyone's enthusiasm about it at the club, I was like, all right, maybe there's some in this that I missed.\"\n\nThe season runs across the autumn and winter, and clubs in the region compete in the North East Harrier League.\n\nThe fixtures are run in teams of four, which score points based on each runner's finishing position.\n\nBut most people do not take part to win.\n\nKayleigh Pickersgill, 40, has been running for more than 10 years and now serves as ladies' captain at Sunderland Strollers.\n\nShe came to running later in life because she found it was good for her mental health \"just to go out and run\".\n\nWhen she joined the club, she had never done cross country before and the club struggled to get the four women needed to make up a team.\n\n\"Someone just asked me if I would run and I went along and I absolutely loved it,\" Pickersgill says.\n\n\"I just decided I'm going to bang the drum for this, because it's so much fun.\"\n\nPickersgill says the numbers have grown to the point where Sunderland Strollers have fielded five women's teams on occasion, instead of struggling to just form one.\n\nAccording to England Athletics, there has been \"significant growth\" in the number of women competing in the North East cross country league in recent years.\n\nClaire Lloyd, 45, is chair of Saltwell Harriers and also hated cross country at school.\n\nBut after joining the club, she quickly got the bug.\n\n\"It's all about the camaraderie and team spirit,\" she says.\n\nMany clubs celebrate with treats following the races. Harrison jokes the cake is what makes him stick around.\n\nAs a winter sport, it can be wet and freezing. But that also seems to be part of the fun.\n\n\"It's a weird one because I was about to say it's still an enjoyable experience, but for a lot of the time, it's not,\" Lloyd says.\n\n\"It's hard, it's really hard, but you get the satisfaction afterwards from having participated.\"\n\nAccording to Lloyd, harsher conditions also level the playing field.\n\n\"I'm not very keen when it's quite dry,\" she says.\n\n\"The dryer courses just play into the hands of the fast people, whereas when it's really boggy and really heavy underfoot it's a bit of a leveller.\n\n\"It slows the fast ones down and gives the rest of us a bit more of a chance.\n\n\"It's not really cross country if it isn't boggy.\"\n\nThe National Cross Country Championships are being held in Hardwick East Park in Sedgefield on 21 February.\n\nIt is the first time the competition has been held in the North East since 2013 and it has not been in County Durham for 25 years.\n\nChris Lines, 54, runs for Sedgefield Harriers, who are helping to organise the event, and says it is great to give local runners the opportunity to line up with the elites.\n\n\"It's one of those rare occasions in the national event of our sport where you can line up as an equal, for the first few yards anyway, with the best runners in the country,\" he says.\n\n\"Everyone starts in the same place and is equal and that is a real privilege.\"\n\nHarrison, Pickersgill, Lloyd and Lines will be among those on that start line.\n\nHarrison says he took part in his first Nationals last year in London and it \"cemented\" his love for the sport.\n\n\"People were turning up there to try and be the best in the country,\" he says.\n\n\"I thought that was quite cool to get a chance to run with some of the quickest runners in the country.\"\n\nPickersgill says that is what makes Nationals so exciting.\n\n\"You get a right mix of abilities,\" she says.\n\n\"You get elites coming to do it, but then you just get the people who are there for the sheer joy of the fact that it's a team day out and it's in the North East and we're going to run around in the mud.\n\n\"It's like a runner's Christmas.\"\n\nFollow BBC North East on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.\n\nUnloved in PE, ignored at top - what is cross country's future?\n\nRun and a bun - the rise of social running groups\n\nThe 'vibrant' running club 'making a real difference'",

Unfortunately, Cole Palmer blazed over the bar when it seemed impossible to miss. But as Liam Rosenior said, we played well for all but a five-minute spell, and JP was once again a key factor in all that.\n\nWe joked that Liam Rosenior’s arrival would revitalize his fellow Liam, but it’s been João Pedro, who’s enjoyed life most under the new manager.

    "fullText": "Arsenal travel to Brentford on Thursday night, aiming to preserve their six-point lead at the top of the Premier League table.\n\nThe Gunners have moved into February with immense momentum, following four consecutive victories that have solidified their title charge. Manager Mikel Arteta oversaw a dominant 3–0 success over Sunderland last weekend, ending the day nine points clear before Manchester City’s late comeback at Anfield. Arsenal arrive in West London seeking a fourth consecutive clean sheet, a defensive feat they last achieved during a record-breaking streak in late 2024.\n\nMikel Arteta navigates fitness concerns regarding several key creative figures. Notably, a persistent hip injury keeps Bukayo Saka on the sidelines. Furthermore, Martin Ødegaard remains a major doubt after missing the last two matches with a minor muscle issue. Consequently, Kai Havertz likely retains his place in a deeper midfield role. Leandro Trossard adds to the headache; he limped off against Sunderland with a calf injury.\n\nDavid Raya starts in goal. Riccardo Calafiori likely features in the defensive line ahead of him, though Piero Hincapie offers a viable alternative. In midfield, Declan Rice and Martin Zubimendi aim to dictate the tempo. Up front, Viktor Gyökeres returns to the starting lineup. He scored twice off the bench last weekend. Gabriel Martinelli and Noni Madueke support him in a revamped attack.\n\nArsenal predicted XI: Raya; Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori; Havertz, Zubimendi, Rice; Madueke, Gyokeres, Martinelli\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at the Gtech Community Stadium on Thursday, 12 February 2026. Kick-off is scheduled for 20:00 GMT.\n\nLive television coverage will be available in the UK on TNT Sports 1. Extended highlights will be shown on Match of the Day on Friday night.\n\nArsenal predicted lineup vs Brentford.

    "fullText": "Carlos Baleba oversaw a ‘nightmare’ first half last night as Brighton and Hove Albion locked horns with Aston Villa in the West Midlands.\n\nAmidst the Seagulls’ desperate plight to find form in the Premier League, the midfielder couldn’t contribute in the way he – or Fabian Hurzeler –  intended ahead of kick-off.\n\n(Photo by Dan Mullan/Getty Images)\n\nBaleba, who was said to be Ruben Amorim’s ‘first-choice’ target last summer, was shown a yellow card inside two minutes at Villa Park.\n\nJust 20 minutes later, Hurzeler decided to withdraw him from the action entirely when he narrowly escaped a second booking, after which the 22-year-old was spotted looking ‘inconsolable’ on the Brighton bench.\n\nThose who’ve kept tabs on Brighton’s affairs during the term will know that Baleba’s performances have faltered considerably in comparison to 2024/2025 – and the Seagulls manager thinks United’s interest has something to do with it.\n\nBack in September, when it was becoming clear that the Cameroonian was struggling to find his feet following an approach from the Red Devils, Hurzeler told reporters: “For sure, when a young boy reads there is interest from Manchester United with a big, big offer, it might affect him deep, deep down.\n\n“That’s also part of the development to understand that when you play well, there comes a big offer, there comes a big club that wants to have him.”\n\n(Photo by Mike Hewitt/Getty Images)\n\nA formal offer was never submitted by United, but Baleba had green-lit the move and made it clear he wanted to make the switch to Old Trafford.\n\nHowever, after Brighton outlined their stance that he wasn’t for sale, he honoured their requests and didn’t go as far as forcing a transfer.\n\nBaleba is now among a host of Premier League stars being monitored by INEOS chiefs in the lead-up to the summer window, with Adam Wharton, Elliot Anderson and Sandro Tonali all greatly admired in M16.\n\nINEOS will be taking note as ‘first-choice’ PL target left ‘inconsolable’ after ‘nightmare’ display\n\nTwo Man Utd stars left sweating for their place in Starting XI after Carrick’s ‘unbelievable’ comment\n\nSky Sports share fresh Michael Carrick update out of Man Utd on Weds afternoon that’ll surprise supporters",

    "fullText": "Olympic skier Tess Johnson, 25, says she never travels to competitions without her journal.\n\nThe American mogul skier journals twice daily — and also carves out time to write before her races.\n\nShe says journaling gets her in the right headspace and helps her stay present and off her phone.\n\nOlympic skier Tess Johnson, 25, starts and ends every day with the same ritual that helps her perform under pressure.\n\nIn an interview with Town & Country Magazine published on Wednesday, the American mogul skier said she always packs her journal when she travels for competitions.\n\n\"I do a little bit of journaling in the morning to set my day, set my goals for the day and a little bit of gratitude, but then in the evening I let it all out and it's a little bit like word vomit, but whatever I need to just get out to get a good night of sleep,\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson made the US national team at 14 — the youngest athlete to do so at the time — and later became the youngest American freestyle skier to medal at the World Championships.\n\nShe debuted at the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics and reached the finals at the 2026 Milan Cortina Games, where she finished 10th.\n\nJohnson, whose grandfather was a former Sports Illustrated writer who covered the Olympics, said journaling plays a key role in her mental preparation.\n\nShe believes she inherited her love of writing from her grandfather and now uses journaling as a practical training tool to track her progress in skiing.\n\n\"And also an emotional tool to just work through whatever anxieties are happening because this is a very intense sport and process that we're going through,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"It's really helpful to get it all out on paper and sift through it just by putting pen to paper. So it does a lot for me. And at the very least, it's just a way to stay present and get off my phone from time to time,\" she continued.\n\nJohnson added that she occasionally rereads her old journals, including those from the 2018 Olympics.\n\n\"It's really cool to see the progress I've made over the years,\" she said.\n\nApart from being a part of her daily routine, journaling is also a key part of her pre-race ritual.\n\n\"The night before I like to journal, whatever in training that day, any other thoughts that I need to get out. Then the morning of, I'll write down three goals for the day, usually relating to my skiing or a mental performance goal, or just something even maybe not related to skiing, just that I have for the day, and then I'll write down a couple things that I'm grateful for as well,\" Johnson said, adding that she does her warm ups after that.\n\nJohnson isn't the only elite athlete who has embraced journaling as part of their routine.\n\nMichael Phelps told Business Insider in 2023 that he uses writing to reflect and unwind, while WNBA star Caitlin Clark has incorporated journaling into her pregame ritual to clear her head and stay focused.\n\nMeanwhile, other Olympians are leaning into surprisingly old-school hobbies in their downtime, including cross-country skier Ben Ogden, who said knitting helps him relax.",

    "fullText": "Premier League leaders Arsenal travel to the Gtech Community Stadium on Thursday night, aiming to banish a peculiar midweek curse and maintain their six-point advantage at the top of the table.\n\nThe Gunners arrive in West London having “banished their January blues,” recording four consecutive wins across all competitions, including a clinical 3–0 victory over Sunderland on Saturday. However, Mikel Arteta’s side faces a historical hurdle: despite an impressive overall midweek record, Arsenal have failed to win—or even score—in any of their last three Premier League games played specifically on a Thursday. Standing in their way is a high-flying Brentford side that has emerged as the season’s “surprise package”. Under Keith Andrews, the seventh-placed Bees have won their last two matches, including a dramatic 3–2 triumph at St James’ Park last weekend.\n\nDate: Thursday, 12 February 2026\n\nVenue: Gtech Community Stadium, London\n\nLast Meeting: Arsenal 2–0 Brentford (2 Dec 2025), Premier League\n\nKeith Andrews remains without Kevin Schade, who serves the second of a three-match suspension for violent conduct. Reiss Nelson is ineligible to face his parent club, while long-term absentees Fabio Carvalho, Antoni Milambo, and Josh Dasilva continue their recoveries. After a strong showing in Newcastle, the Bees are expected to remain largely unchanged, though Yehor Yarmolyuk is pushing for a start in midfield.\n\nMikel Arteta faces several late fitness calls. Bukayo Saka (hip) and Martin Ødegaard (muscle) both missed the Sunderland win and remain doubtful for the derby. Leandro Trossard is also a major doubt after sustaining a calf issue late against the Black Cats. However, Viktor Gyökeres is poised for a recall to the starting XI after his decisive brace off the bench last weekend.\n\nThe Gunners have maintained a high level of performance in local fixtures. Notably, Arsenal have lost just one of their last 23 Premier League London derbies (W17 D5). Defensively, they arrive in peak condition, having kept three consecutive clean sheets in all competitions heading into Thursday’s clash. However, the “Thursday curse” remains a concern, as the team has failed to score in their last three league outings on this specific day.\n\nThe Bees have turned their home ground into a nightmare for visitors. Notably, Igor Thiago has been in sensational form, netting nine goals in his last 10 home matches—a tally bettered only by Erling Haaland this season. Brentford also boast a clinical edge, with an xG per shot of 0.16, the best by any Premier League team in the last five seasons. While they are winless in eight against the Gunners, their current form suggests they are more than capable of an upset.\n\nBrentford Predicted XI: Kelleher; Kayode, Van den Berg, Ajer, Henry; Janelt, Henderson; Ouattara, Jensen, Lewis-Potter; Thiago\n\nArsenal Predicted XI: Raya; Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori; Havertz, Zubimendi, Rice; Madueke, Gyokeres, Martinelli\n\nThe match will be televised live in the UK on TNT Sports 1, with coverage starting at 19:00 GMT ahead of the 20:00 kick-off.

    "description": "It didn’t take new Jazz player Jaren Jackson Jr. much time to get used to his new digs at the Delta Center.",
    "fullText": "It didn’t take new Jazz player Jaren Jackson Jr. much time to get used to his new digs at the Delta Center.\n\nIn front of a sellout crowd of 18,186 in his first home game as a Jazzman, Jackson Jr. provided Utah fans with a glimpse of what this team could be next season in a 121-93 win over a depleted Sacramento Kings team.\n\nWith just one game left until the all-star break and just 27 to go in the season, the Jazz are seeing the light at the end of the tanking tunnel.\n\n“Yeah, it’s a high ceiling. Tonight we didn’t have our full group out there, obviously, and just getting Keyonte and Walker back. Really excited what we can do with this group,” said Jazz forward Lauri Markkanen.\n\n“I think we can do a lot of different things, different coverage on defense and then run the offense differently depending on who’s got it going and what the matchups be. And I think having this group of guys and obviously Will (Hardy) leading us, he’s kind of picking his brain to getting us what’s working on different nights. And so I’m really excited.”\n\nJackson Jr. scored a game-high 23 points on 61.5% shooting and added four rebounds, two assists, a steal and a block in his home debut.\n\n“He’s a very efficient offensive player. He can do it both inside and out. I told Jaren that I think the thing that I’ve appreciated the most about him offensively is how he uses the 3-point line. I think he has a good ratio right now. He’s not just launching 3s. I think he’s a capable shooter, but his physicality and his touch around the basket’s really good,” said Jazz coach Will Hardy.\n\nMarkkanen and Brice Sensabaugh scored 19 points apiece and rookie Ace Bailey pitched in 13 in the Jazz’s dominant win.\n\n“I thought the team was really focused for the most part, start to finish, did a good job protecting the paint again. It’s been a theme lately and it’s allowed us to play in transition a little bit more than we have been, which has been good for us. And then I think the group is doing a really good job of playing off of each other,” Hardy said.\n\nThe Jazz won their second game in a row, starting star players Jackson Jr. and Markkanen against a depleted Sacramento Kings team without Russell Westbrook, Zach Lavine, Malik Monk, Domantas Sabonis, Keegan Murray and De’Andre Hunter.\n\nThe Jazz were only missing Keyonte George and, of course, Walker Kessler from the lineup on Wednesday night.\n\nUtah’s starting lineup was simply too much for the hapless Kings, and as a result, the Jazz raced out to a 39-20 lead over the visitors behind 12 points from Jackson Jr., nine points from Markkanen and eight points from Sensabaugh in the first quarter\n\nThe Jazz shot 55% from the field, including 50% from 3, in the first period of play while limiting the Kings to 36.8% shooting.\n\nAfter outscoring the Kings 32-24 in the second quarter to lead 71-44 at the half, the Jazz were able to coast to an easy win.\n\nThe Kings (12-44) continued their hold on the worst record in the NBA as BYU star AJ Dybantsa, who should be selected within the first three picks of the 2026 NBA draft, watched what could be one of his future teams from courtside seats at the Delta Center.\n\nWednesday was Jackson Jr.’s third game with his new team, but in some ways, it felt like his first with the Jazz. It was the former Grizzlies forward’s first time in front of his new home crowd, his first time in the Utah locker room and his first time running out of the home tunnel.\n\n“This kind of felt like my first game in a weird way,” he said.\n\nJackson Jr. got a loud ovation from the crowd when he was introduced and any time he scored, and received walk-off interview honors following the performance as the crowd showed him their appreciation.\n\n“I was kind of just enjoying the moment. … And I just wanted to enjoy it. It helped that we were winning. It helps me enjoy the game more. So credit to everybody getting me this win here. But yeah, it was dope. Great experience,” Jackson Jr. said.\n\nAside from his offensive play, Jackson Jr. was brought to Salt Lake City to raise the team’s defensive profile. The Jazz have owned the worst defense in the NBA this season — partly due to roster design — and the addition of the 2022-23 Defensive Player of the Year instantly improves that side of the ball.\n\nIt came against a Kings team missing pretty much all of its meaningful players, but Wednesday night’s win was the first time this season that the Jazz have held an opponent under 100 points.\n\n“Just being active. I think talking for sure when I’m behind the guards in the back line, letting them know where I’m at, let them know what they should do,” Jackson Jr. said. “They have a lot of new schemes here that I think we could take advantage of because of our size. Personnel helps us get a lot of things done, but you got to have that intensity too. So I think we’ve already been better, so that’s good.”\n\nThe Jazz sent out a supersized starting lineup of Jackson (6-10), Markkanen (7-1), Jusuf Nurkic (6-11), Ace Bailey (6-9) and Isaiah Collier (6-4). The Kings had no answer for the Jazz’s size, and Utah outscored Sacramento 58-42 in the paint.\n\n“His size. He can protect the paint. He can guard the perimeter. And then obviously on the offensive end, he’s a tough matchup with anybody,” Markkanen said of Jackson Jr. “With all three of us out there, we have a big lineup and someone’s going to have a small (matchup) at times and he’s one of the best ones to punish this matchup for sure.”\n\nAside from his contributions on the court, Jackson Jr. has quickly acclimated himself to the locker room, and Hardy is just as excited for his off-the-court impact.\n\n“When we traded for Jaren, obviously there’s so much talk about the player and I’m very excited about the player, but what we’re trying to build as an organization and a program, Jaren’s character and who he is as a person is just as important, and I think that that has been really evident from the day that he got here,” Hardy said.\n\n“He’s a high character guy. He’s got a good sense of humor. He also has a respect level that comes with him because of how he’s played during his career. So I think that from a human standpoint, he’s meshing with the group really well. We haven’t talked about that as much as the player piece, but what I’ve seen from him and Vince (Williams Jr.) and John (Konchar) is that all three are really, really high character guys and we’re lucky to have them in our organization.”",

    "fullText": "Brentford host Arsenal at the Gtech Community Stadium on Thursday night, seeking to maintain their surprise push for European football.\n\nThe Bees have moved into seventh place following a string of clinical performances under manager Keith Andrews. Brentford arrive in this London derby with high confidence after securing back-to-back wins over Aston Villa and Newcastle United. Notably, the home side has outperformed expectations this season, already completing a league double over Newcastle. A victory tonight would break a long winless run against the Gunners and significantly boost their hopes of a top-six finish.\n\nKeith Andrews manages a squad significantly thinned in the attacking areas. Notably, Kevin Schade is unavailable as he serves the second of a three-game ban for a straight red card received against Aston Villa. Consequently, Dango Ouattara is expected to keep his place after his match-winning heroics at St James’ Park. The Bees are also without Reiss Nelson, who is ineligible to play against his parent club.\n\nCaoimhín Kelleher will start in goal behind a defensive unit likely featuring Nathan Collins and Sepp van den Berg. Keane Lewis-Potter has impressed in a versatile role on the left, while Vitaly Janelt and Mathias Jensen anchor the midfield. Igor Thiago spearheads the attack as the league’s second-highest scorer with 17 goals. Notably, Brentford boast the joint-best defence in the league over the last eight matchdays, conceding just seven goals.\n\nBrentford predicted XI: Kelleher; Kayode, Van den Berg, Ajer, Henry; Janelt, Henderson; Ouattara, Jensen, Lewis-Potter; Thiago\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at the Gtech Community Stadium on Thursday, 12 February 2026. Kick-off is scheduled for 20:00 GMT.\n\nLive television coverage will be available in the UK on TNT Sports 1. Extended highlights will be shown on Match of the Day on Friday night.\n\nRead more- Slot admits Reds ‘not performing to Liverpool standards’\n\nSee Also- Fantasy Premier League: Five Arsenal players to buy in Double Gameweek 26\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "If you build it, they will come?\n\nSome Iowa state senators introduced a bill this week that would expand the state's major economic growth attraction program, creating financial incentives that could lure an NFL team seeking to build a stadium in the Hawkeye State.\n\nTheir target? The Chicago Bears.\n\n\"After years of Bears fans seeking refuge across the Mississippi River from the incompetence, corruption and punitive tax and regulatory climate in the state of Illinois, it is time for the team to join their fans on the west side of the river,\" Republican Scott Webster, one of the legislation's sponsors said in a statement.\n\n\"Iowa can offer the Bears everything they need to build a world-class facility, tax certainty and the public infrastructure they need in a state led by common-sense conservatives.\"\n\nThe recruitment pitch didn't end there.\n\n\"While Illinois and Indiana squabble over this issue, we are ready to get off the sidelines and into the game,\" Kerry Gruenhagen, another senator sponsoring the bill, said in a statement. \"Bringing an NFL team to Iowa would attract jobs, tourism and fans to our state and give us the opportunity to showcase what Iowa really has to offer. Iowans have dedicated themselves to our college sports teams, and we're ready to attract a professional team to our great state.\"\n\nWhile Iowa was the stage for \"Field of Dreams,\" it isn't home to any major professional sports franchises.\n\nOne of the NFL's original franchises, born in 1920 as the Decatur Staleys, the Bears have been seeking a new stadium for years. Tenants of historic Soldier Field, the league's smallest venue in terms of capacity (61,500) in downtown Chicago since 1971, the Bears had planned to move to suburban Arlington Heights, where they own a 326-acre tract of land that used to be the site of Arlington International Racecourse.\n\nBut team president Kevin Warren wrote in a letter to season ticket-holders in December that an inability to get assistance from the state of Illinois in offsetting infrastructure costs around the proposed project had led the team to consider alternatives. The team has committed to paying for construction of a new stadium itself.\n\n\"We have not asked for state taxpayer dollars to build the stadium at Arlington Park. We asked only for a commitment to essential local infrastructure (roads, utilities, and site improvements) which is more than typical for projects of this size,\" Warren wrote. \"Additionally, we sought reasonable property tax certainty to secure financing. We listened to state leadership and relied on their direction and guidance, yet our efforts have been met with no legislative partnership.\n\n\"We have been told directly by State leadership, our project will not be a priority in 2026.\"\n\nWarren specifically cited Northwest Indiana as a potential locale to build a new stadium.\n\nHowever, Illinois officials continue working to find a solution that would keep the Bears, a beloved team and one on the rise after winning the NFC North for the first time since 2018, in the Chicagoland area, where they've played since 1921.\n\n\"There’s a lot of discussion, a lot of ongoing conversation with the Bears, and indeed, frankly, progress that’s been made. So I’m pleased about that,\" Gov. JB Pritzker said Monday.\n\n\"But I’m going to let the Bears talk about what it is that they want to get done and how they want to get it done. And I’m obviously involved in negotiations and so are my entire team, as well as the members of the Legislature.\"\n\nAll NFL news on and off the field. \n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Chicago Bears to Iowa?

    "title": "Scientists Figured Out the Problem with Johnson and Johnson's Covid Vaccine",
    "description": "Rare but dangerous blood clotting associated with that vaccine as well as AstraZeneca’s had a genetic cause, according to a new paper.",
    "fullText": "In 2021, just months after the first COVID vaccines debuted, concern was growing about an exceedingly rare but sometimes deadly outcome of certain shots. Two related vaccines—one from AstraZeneca and the other from Johnson & Johnson—were linked to dangerous blood clotting.\n\nOut of almost 19 million doses of Johnson & Johnson’s version given in the United States during the first two years of the pandemic, at least 60 such cases were identified. Nine of them were fatal. In the United Kingdom, where almost 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca shot were given, 455 cases occurred; 81 people died. In Germany, at least 71 cases were identified, also linked to AstraZeneca. By late spring, use of both the AstraZeneca and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was paused, and ultimately both were pulled from the market. But the mystery surrounding the rare blood clotting caused by these vaccines lingered.\n\nNow researchers believe they have cracked the case. They have hard evidence for how the blood clotting happened, and they believe that their findings could help make similar vaccines even safer. Understanding the blood-clotting problem is important, they say, because vaccines of this type could be essential in protecting people during future pandemics.\n\nThe team that initially gave this condition a name—vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, or VITT—included Andreas Greinacher, a blood expert at the University of Greifswald, in Germany. Back in 2021, as the cases of VITT emerged, he and others were unsure of what precipitated them. One theory was that they were caused by the body’s accidental reaction to the type of virus used in both the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines: adenoviruses, which had been engineered to prompt the body to recognize the pandemic coronavirus but were unable to replicate and considered harmless to people. Scientists had noticed that patients with VITT had telltale markers in their blood—antibodies that bind to a chemical signal released by platelets. Maybe a reaction to the adenovirus was causing immune cells to mistakenly go after a blood component and precipitate clotting. An alternative theory was that the body was reacting to a portion of the coronavirus called “spike protein,” which showed up as part of the immunization.\n\nIn a study published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, Greinacher and his colleagues show that the first theory was correct: VITT was a response to the adenovirus gone awry. And they discovered a further twist: This immune overreaction happened in people who were genetically prone to it.\n\nIn the study, Greinacher and his colleagues looked at the antibodies in stored blood from 21 patients with VITT. Among those antibodies, they found a subset that could glom on to a portion of the adenovirus and to one of the body’s own molecules, PF4, that can influence blood clotting. A person who received one of the adenovirus vaccines but did not have a reaction also had antibodies against that same part of the adenovirus. But, crucially, that person’s antibodies did not cross-react with PF4.\n\nThose antibody molecules also offered clues about the immune cells that made them. And the scientists were able to link the immune cells responsible for VITT to patients who had two specific DNA variants. A wider survey of 100 VITT patients found that all of them had immune cells with one of these genetic types—which are far from universal. This signaled to the researchers that having these particular variants is a strong risk factor for blood clotting following an adenovirus vaccine.\n\nBut the study also showed that this genetic background on its own was not enough to cause VITT. The immune cells that made the dangerous antibodies had experienced an additional small genetic change, and that extra mutation had prompted them to produce those cross-reactive molecules.\n\nIn the past, scientists have suggested that genetic predispositions might explain some adverse events that happen after vaccination. For example, some data have indicated that certain people were genetically prone to developing narcolepsy following a version of swine-flu vaccine that was briefly used in Europe. But the new study from Greinacher and his team is the first to provide concrete evidence of how people with a particular DNA variant can develop self-sabotaging antibodies following a vaccination. Arnold Lining Ju, a biomedical engineer at the University of Sydney who has studied blood clotting, told me that the paper was a landmark finding in part because of how elegantly it explains the way a specific genetic trait, combined with a particular chance mutation in certain cells, creates VITT. And because the study shows that multiple genetic changes are involved, it finally explains why this immune reaction is so rare, he said.\n\nThis discovery will help guide researchers more than it will influence vaccination choices for individual patients. Most vaccine recipients will not know their genetic predisposition to an adverse event, Jennifer Juno, a vaccine researcher at the University of Melbourne, points out. But this type of work will help improve vaccine design—particularly in the field of “precision vaccinology,” in which vaccines are tailored to individual traits, Joanne Reed, the director of the Centre for Immunology and Allergy Research at the Westmead Institute in Australia, told me.\n\nThese results also mean that adenovirus-based vaccines could be made safer if they can be designed without the protein region that triggered the dangerous antibodies in VITT. “Instead of abandoning an entire vaccine platform because of a rare problem, we can engineer around the specific issue, and that’s the power of this kind of science,” Joann Arce of the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children’s Hospital told me. The hope is that understanding the biology of a rare event like VITT, and then addressing it, helps bolster public trust in vaccines too. Greinacher told me that adenovirus-based vaccines remain vital, including for the development of vaccines for diseases that affect mostly low- and middle-income countries. The shots could also be useful in a future pandemic, because they can be scaled up in production relatively quickly.\n\nStill, this one study may not have entirely answered the question of why adenovirus-based COVID vaccines caused clotting. A study published last year from Ju’s group suggested that a separate biophysical mechanism might cause a viral component found in the AstraZeneca vaccine to directly aggregate platelets, independent of the immune reaction identified in VITT. And a bigger mystery remains open too—why infections themselves are sometimes associated with dangerous blood clotting. Rushad Pavri, an immunologist at King’s College London, told me that the new study—because it shows how similarities between a virus particle and an innate protein involved in clotting can confuse the immune system—can shed light on that question. Ultimately, understanding why viruses can provoke immune overreactions might help limit damaging complications from sickness to begin with.",

    "description": "Renewables are positioned as the long-term winner over fossil fuels due to lower lifetime operating costs, faster deployment timelines, improving battery storage, and better demand-side management.",
    "fullText": "The global electric power business is changing. The economic hegemony of fossil fuels (and perhaps nuclear as well) is gradually being undermined by the adoption of renewable generating technologies such as solar and wind.  This economic and technological transition resembles warfare or a sporting event with distinct winners and losers. Our argument is based on a stunningly non-controversial premise—namely, that superior, lower-cost technologies producing an identical commodity eventually achieve dominance.\n\nLet’s look at a previous technology transition, from telegraph to telephones, to see if it offers clues about the present power-generating transition.\n\nAlexander Graham Bell received his telephone patent in the US in 1876. Universal phone service was on its way to being the accepted norm by the early 1900s. During this early period, telephone use was increasing, but so was that of the telegraph system, as the economy grew. Heavy commercial users depended on the information it carried, especially so in financial markets, railroads, newspapers, and the government. The original Wall Street ticker tape was a specialized form of telegraph. (The telegraph system, incidentally,  replaced the Pony Express, which took ten days to deliver messages from St. Joseph, Missouri to California.)\n\nThe telephone and telegraph, two competing technologies,  thrived side by side into the early part of the twentieth century,  although the growth in transcontinental phone service began around 1920 to eclipse the demand for telegraphy. The dominant telegraph provider Western Union, founded in 1851, lost ground in the post World War Two years and finalized its demise in the 1980s via unfortunate corporate restructurings and the addition of significant debt. However, the name itself still carried so much prestige and value that it remained in use until 2006 in the money transfer business.  These two competing communications technologies, telephony and telegraphy, existed and operated profitably side by side for decades, although one was gradually lapsing into technological irrelevance.\n\nRenewables, in our view, are the new dominant power-generating technology, analogous to telephones and fossil fuels will gradually fade thing like telegraph.\n\nRenewables will absolutely crush fossil fuels, over the long term, in electric generation because:\n\n1) Renewables will show a lower lifetime cost of operation (no fuel costs). This will be the game changer. (Okay, this is not so evident now. The projected all- in costs of renewables- with storage -and those of low -cost -fossil- fuel generation are close.  But fossil -fuel generation cost  is vulnerable to increases from fuel cost inflation, pollution controls, and environmental lawsuits that should be factored into any realistic long term scenario.) So, consider two power-generating sources, producing the same commodity,  only one of which, fossil fuels, has enormous lifetime (and probably increasing) fuel costs. The other technology has high initial build costs (we call these capital costs) and then produces electricity essentially for free, meaning it has relatively low operating expenses. We don’t think it’s a unique insight to call this an insurmountable competitive advantage. This is the whole game from an economic perspective right here. Everything else after this, as the sage said, is just commentary.\n\n2) Renewables can be deployed more rapidly: two-year new build time versus 5-6 for new gas-fired power generation and 10+ years for new nuclear power stations. Time is money, and the cost of capital tied up for years in a project gets passed on to consumers.\n\n3) Proliferation of batteries increases renewables penetration and begins to address the principal criticism against them, the intermittency of power production. Batteries provide storage capability, enhancing or offsetting the generating limitations of renewables. And in places like California, they are displacing natural gas-fired power generation as well.\n\n4) Demand side management (DSM) techniques are also improving for shifting electrical load and this only helps this transition. One benefit of large commercial electricity customers in a utility’s service area is that they are or can be extremely price sensitive and, as sophisticated customers, can be willing participants in DSM programs with the right incentives.\n\n5) Renewables produce less pollution and environmental degradation. Climate change concerns, however, in our view, have less to do with the emerging dominance of renewables than people realize. In contemporary slang, one might say “It’s all about the Benjamin’s, baby.”\n\nBut there is a further analogy between wholesale electricity power production and the transition from the telegraph to the telephone. The essence of the telegraph was short correspondence and data. Today we call those emails and faxes. We still communicate in a fairly similar fashion, but via a completely different conveyance system that’s digital and fiber optic. Similarly, the photo camera industry is mostly a relic, but people still love taking and sharing pictures, just now it’s with their phones. We don’t think electricity is any different in this respect. Electricity consumers of all types simply want affordable and reliable power, and they don’t care all that much about how it's made. Renewables, for the reasons cited, will produce electricity more cheaply (and more reliably) than fossil-fired competitors. For that reason, they will continue to take market share and increasingly displace fossil-fired generation in all power markets where they compete.\n\nIn the electricity business, fossil-fired power generation, to remain dominant,  needs superior technology and the ability to undercut competitors on price. Our fossil fuel industry today possesses neither. Its costs will rise more or less at the rate of inflation not counting the increasing volatility of natural gas markets. Renewables, on the other hand, are a technology where costs are declining with new scientific advances in things like battery materials and solar panel efficiency. To us, this type of economic competition is like a war in which only one party emerges victorious. The fossil fuel industry may have already lost.\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",

    "fullText": "I’ve been hoping to write a GUI for my Emacs clone for a while now. And I’m putting together a list of Emacs’ display features to keep compatible with when designing the GUI. Unsurprisingly, this list just keeps growing, and, nah,\n\nWaiting to feel ready to do the thing is not doing the thing. 1\n\nSo, I really need to start writing the shittiest Emacs GUI ever.\n\nOf course, writing a blog post to announce “I will write a shitty GUI” is not doing the thing. But at least I get to partly explain “why Emacs redisplay is hard”, as is mentioned in a previous blog post.\n\nSince I do aim to be as compatible with GNU Emacs as possible, we will need to look into how Emacs does rendering, or, in other words, some of the largest C source files in Emacs:\n\nAccording to comments in these files, the 1.2 MB, 38k-line xdisp.c handles “display generation”, xterm.c provides “X window system support”, with “subroutines comprising the redisplay interface, setting up scroll bars and widgets, and handling input”, and sfnt.c is for TrueType format font support. So, indeed a huge part of Emacs’ C core goes to redisplay handling, and even trying to grasp a deeper understanding of it can take significant effort.\n\nFortunately, Emacs contributors have gifted us ample comments for us to gain a bird’s-eye view of Emacs’ rendering internals, like this architecure diagram:\n\nFollowing the comments, we will then come across the central data structure in Emacs redisplay: glyph matrices, defined in dispextern.h. The authors have made it flexible enough to support three text rendering/layout scenarios: Emacs GUI windows, Emacs TUI frames, and Emacs buffer windows nested in TUI frames:\n\nEach glyph matrix contains a bunch of glyph rows, whose contents are filled by display_line, which accepts a glyph iterator and repeatedly push the iterator forward, filling out glyph slot one by one.\n\nIt still sounds quite simple… until it doesn’t.\n\nIt turns out that “pushing the glyph iterator forward” in display_line is just not as simple as it seems: not all texts are read from left to right, and the glyph iterator does not always move one character at a time. Here is an example:\n\nNotice how \"star\" is rendered as s t a r (of course), but כוכב is rendered in a different order? The first Unicode character s[0] is כ, which is rendered at the rightmost column, while the second Unicode character s[1] (ו) is rendered as the third column counting from the left.\n\nThis is because the כוכב text is in Hebrew, which should be read from right to left. And when we mix English and Hebrew texts in the same line, any competent Unicode rendering engine will make sure that the Hebrew text is rendered from right to left. And that means, for right-to-left texts, our glyph iterator will need to jump until the end of that segment and iterate backwards.\n\nI would describe this as a solved problem: Unicode has a well-defined algorithm for rendering bidirectional texts. However, Emacs’ bidi.c is around 120 kB, or around 4k lines, which still doesn’t include the code to pack and unpack a whole Unicode database. I guess that gives a good idea of how much work it might take to support bidirectional text in Emacs, if you don’t use an external library.\n\nFor some other languages, BIDI rendering is not enough. Their characters might “compose” into more complex glyphs, or, “ligatures”. For example, the following Arabic texts 2 must be rendered together as a single glyph to be readable for Arabic speakers:\n\nSupporting ligatures is not a simple matter. It has to know about the font(s) used, and thus needs to handle platform-specific font databases, support font fallback, etc., and have decent performance. The industry standard for this is the HarfBuzz library, and there is a reason that its home page references the xkcd “Dependency” meme:\n\nEmacs also makes use of HarfBuzz, and does support ligatures. It’s only that, Emacs being Emacs, it allows you to customize the whole process, with Lisp code.\n\nTaken from the famous Text Rendering Hates You post. If you haven’t read it, please please go and read it.\n\nEmacs supports ligatures through its character compositions. When iterating through a glyph iterator, it calls composition_reseat_it to produce the corresponding composed glyphs (if any), and then walk the iterator into those glyphs. But, instead of directly delegating to HarfBuzz, Emacs checks composition-function-table first, where the user might put a regexp precondition and then any Lisp code to compose glyphs as they wish.\n\nFor some (or many?), this can be annoying since the default precondition regexps exclude most ligature combinations in programming fonts. For example, - > will not compose into something like → even if you use a font like Fira Code. To support that, you will need to configure the composition-function-table manually, or use ligature.el.\n\nThe above is only about text layout - what glyphs to use on screen, and where to place them. But, like any text rendering engine, of course Emacs allows you to style your text, with something called text properties. For example, by setting a proper face property for a text span, one can customize its font, size, colors, and text decorations. Also, there are some more self-explanatory properties, like invisible, line-height, line-prefix, or display-line-numbers-disable.\n\nBasically, it’s just CSS for text, except that Emacs has made some parts of it … nearly Turing complete?\n\nSo, there is another text property called display, which can contain display properties. For example, with a string display property, the text span will be replaced by that string. For another, by setting a height display property, one can control the height of the texts:\n\nAnd, by setting that height display property to a symbol…\n\n… one can control the height of the texts dynamically, as the Emacs redisplay routine will now call the function pointed by that symbol for a height value.\n\nglyphless-char-display: For glyphless chars, one can display them by hex code, tofu boxes, etc.:\n\nDisplay tables like buffer-display-table: This allows you to override the display of characters in a buffer by replacing them with a string in the table.\n\ncomposition: Another special text property. One may use this to overlap glyphs together. This is purely visual and only works under GUI Emacs.\n\nI am quite sure that anyone reading this blog post can find some unexpected features of GNU Emacs’ redisplay. I’m not saying that those features are “problematic”, but during Emacs’ decades of evolution, people’s expectations certainly have changed.\n\nIt used to be fine to mix up computation and rendering when multi-threading wasn’t a thing; and now, everybody expects some concurrent rendering to make use of all those CPU cores. Terminals used to have quite limited support for characters, and display tables were helpful for converting undisplayable characters into something readable; but now, everything speaks Unicode, and display tables suddenly make little sense. Editors used to be all about texts; and now even terminals get to display images.\n\nSo, if you, people from modern times, are looking to copy Emacs’ redisplay behavior, things are going to be quite tricky. Concurrent display? What about those Turing complete text properties? They need to be run on the main thread. What about composition-function-table which also require running Lisp code?\n\nIt’s time to make some choices.\n\nFirst off, Juicemacs aims to be an exploratory Emacs clone. And for its GUI, I want to go to the extreme: it’s going to build on RPC/IPC protocols and push as much of the work to the client as possible. So, a shitty, minimally functional implementation will need:\n\nThanks for reading! If you have any feedback, any thoughts on a GUI design or some more unexpected Emacs features that I’ve overlooked, please let me know!\n\nThis blog post is also a submission to this month’s Emacs Carnival, theming “This year, I’ll …”. Check it out for more Emacsers’ Emacs plans!",

    "fullText": "An independent forensic report is challenging the 1994 suicide ruling in Kurt Cobain’s death and urging Seattle authorities to review the case, citing contested evidence. The review, by forensic specialist Brian Burnett and researcher Michelle Wilkins, examines the Kurt Cobain death using autopsy details and scene analysis reported via The Daily Mail. It questions whether Cobain could have fired the weapon, citing organ findings some say align with a heroin overdose, and evaluates blood patterns, hand placement, and paraphernalia. The King County Medical Examiner’s Office states it has seen nothing warranting a reopening, and the Seattle Police Department has declined past requests. The report seeks transparency, not arrests; Cobain’s death remains officially classified as a suicide.",

    "description": "President Trump says nearly all governors are welcome at the White House for a formal meeting and dinner next week, though the Democratic governors of Maryland and Colorado are still being excluded.",
    "fullText": "President Trump said Wednesday that nearly all governors are welcome at the White House for a formal meeting and dinner next week, though the Democratic governors of Maryland and Colorado are still being excluded.\n\nThe White House was initially going to exclude Democratic governors from a formal, typically bipartisan business meeting on Feb. 20 during the annual National Governors Association (NGA) conference, according to the NGA and a source familiar with the White House's planning.\n\nAnd two Democratic governors, Wes Moore of Maryland and Jared Polis of Colorado, said they were informed by the NGA last Friday they would not be invited to a separate dinner at the White House on Feb. 21 with the president, the governors and their spouses.\n\nBut after talks between the White House and Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican who chairs the NGA, the organization and the president said Wednesday that governors from both parties are welcome to both the meeting and the dinner. Democratic governors began receiving invitations on Wednesday evening to the business meeting, though the NGA did not receive updates about the White House dinner.\n\nGov. Stitt informed governors of all 55 states and territories on Wednesday that all are invited to the formal meeting on Feb. 20.\n\n\"He was very clear in his communications with me that this is a National Governors Association's event, and he looks forward to hosting you and hearing from governors across the country. President Trump said this was always his intention, and we have addressed the misunderstanding in scheduling,\" Stitt wrote in a message to governors obtained by CBS News.\n\nIn a Wednesday afternoon Truth Social post after Stitt's message was sent, Mr. Trump wrote that Moore and Polis are still excluded. He suggested there was a misunderstanding between him and Stitt.\n\n\"The invitations were sent to ALL Governors, other than two, who I feel are not worthy of being there,\" Trump wrote, adding that he \"even invited\" two of his political foes, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and California Gov. Gavin Newsom. \"So, as usual with him, Stitt got it WRONG! The Invitations were sent out to all other Governors, Democrat and Republican.\"\n\nMoore still received an invite on Wednesday to the formal meeting, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nIt is unclear if Polis received an invitation to that meeting as well. A spokesperson for the Colorado governor said \"no matter what events Colorado is or isn't invited to, Governor Polis will continue to focus on working with his fellow governors and anyone who wants to help make people's lives better.\" CBS News has reached out to the White House.\n\nThe NGA said it was informed by the White House on Feb. 5 that only Republican governors would be invited to the formal business meeting. Because of these exclusions, the NGA said the following day that it would not facilitate that meeting or put it on the group's official schedule. Stitt reiterated that in a letter to governors on Monday, and defended Moore as \"an exceptional vice chair\" for the NGA.\n\nAfter reports of Democratic governors being excluded from the meeting, nearly every Democratic governor put out a joint statement Tuesday that indicated they wouldn't attend any White House events, including the dinner, out of solidarity with Moore and Polis.\n\nIn his Wednesday post, Mr. Trump cited a disagreement over the imprisonment of former Colorado county election clerk Tina Peters as the reason for not inviting Polis. The president has pushed Polis for months to grant clemency to Peters, who is serving a nine-year sentence on multiple state charges related to unauthorized access to voting machines.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump called Moore \"foul mouthed\" and claimed he had embellished receiving military medals, though Moore has said it was an \"honest mistake\" on a White House fellowship application in 2006. He has since received a Bronze Star for his deployment to Afghanistan.\n\nThe president also criticized Stitt, calling him a \"RINO,\" or Republican in name only. Stitt had backed Mr. Trump's former opponent, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, during the 2024 Republican presidential primaries.\n\nMoore called the decision not to invite him \"another example of blatant disrespect and a snub to the spirit of bipartisan federal-state partnership\" in a statement earlier this week.\n\nA Polis spokesperson called it a \"disappointing decision for a traditionally bipartisan event between Governors and whomever occupies the White House.\"\n\nGovernors from both parties attended a White House meeting and dinner during last year's conference. The meeting drew attention for a verbal scuffle between Mr. Trump and Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, in which the president pressed Mills on the issue of transgender women in sports, and Mills responded: \"We'll see you in court.\"\n\nDetails on new images of subject in Nancy Guthrie disappearance\n\nWatch: Rep.

    "fullText": "Singapore’s Budget for 2026 will be delivered on Thursday (12 Feb) at 3.30pm by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong. He is likely to use his speech to address a number of key issues such as Singaporean concerns over jobs and rising cost of living. PM Wong is also expected to position Singapore as an AI hub and provide an update on Singapore’s Economic Strategy Review. Economists believe this year’s Budget could see a scaling back of the the generous Community Development Council (CDC) voucher scheme seen in previous Budgets.\n\nThe Philippine Embassy in Singapore and the Philippine Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) are both aware of a video circulating online showing a man assaulting a Filipina at Lucky Plaza. DMW Secretary Hans Cacdac was quoted as saying they are looking into it and filing the necessary legal actions.\n\nRead \n\nPrime Minister Lawrence Wong will deliver his 2026 Budget speech on Thursday (12 Feb) at 3.30pm.\n\nThe Budget will be broadcast live on Mediacorp’s Channel 5 but you can also watch a livestream on PM Wong’s own YouTube channel, among other options.\n\nWhat may feature in Budget 2026:\n\nMore support measures for workers will be announced. PM Wong made this point in a YouTube video posted on Wednesday (11 Feb).\n\nPM Wong will likely use his Budget speech to position Singapore as an artificial intelligence (AI) hub, says Bloomberg.\n\nWith a focus on AI, the Government will need to address its potential affect on jobs. Retraining of workers will likely be a significant topic too.\n\nExpect to see more on social safety nets as with Budget 2025 as cost of living concerns remain for an ageing population.\n\nAn update on Singapore’s Economic Strategy Review, which launched last year, is also expected.\n\nThe generous Community Development Council (CDC) voucher scheme in previous Budgets could be scaled back in Budget 2026, with economists expecting smaller payouts and tighter income criteria.\n\nA man is seen arguing with a woman and then kicking her in viral videos taken at Lucky Plaza mall in Orchard Road. Police are now investigating the incident, reports the Straits Times on Thursday (12 Feb).\n\nPolice told the newspaper that a police report was lodged and investigations are ongoing.\n\nEarlier, the Philippine Embassy in Singapore said they were aware of the videos and confirmed the woman who was attacked is a Filipina. Lucky Plaza is a well-known hangout spot for foreign domestic workers on Sundays.\n\n“We continue to closely monitor the situation and remain in contact with the victim to help ensure her safety and well-being,” the embassy said in a statement.\n\nThe Philippine Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) told GMA News they are looking into the possibility of legal action, as reported earlier in this blog on Thursday.\n\nEnforcement operations against motorists who commit traffic violations and cut queues at Woodlands Checkpoint will be stepped up from 13 to 17 February.\n\nThe operations will be carried out by the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) and the Traffic Police.\n\n“Failure to maintain lane discipline and obey traffic rules can cause severe congestion and compromise the safety of other motorists,” ICA said in a Facebook statement on Thursday (12 February).\n\nErrant drivers of foreign-registered vehicles may face entry bans, while Singapore drivers may be referred to the Traffic Police for further investigations and penalties.\n\nMotorists caught engaging in queue cutting will be made to re-queue, warned ICA.\n\nFour-room flats in Tampines had the highest application rates among first-time home buyers in HDB’s latest Build-To-Order (BTO) sales exercise, according to data shared by National Development Minister Chee Hong Tat on Wednesday (11 Feb).\n\nAn application rate is the number of applicants divided by the number of units available. The lower the rate, the higher the chances of success are for the applicant.\n\nChee said, as of 5pm on Wednesday, there had been 14,052 BTO applications. He also listed the following application rates:\n\nBukit Merah (Redhill Peaks): 0.7 for 3-room / 2.0 for 4-room\n\nSembawang (Sembawang Deck): 1.3 for 3-room\n\nSembawang (Sembawang Deck/Sembawang Voyage): 0.6 for 4-room; 0.4 for 5-room\n\nTampines (Tampines Bliss): 3.4 for 3-room\n\nTampines (Tampines Bliss/Tampines Nova): 6.8 for 4-room\n\nToa Payoh (Kim Keat Crest): 0.6 for 3-room; 0.8 for 4-room\n\nApplications closed at 11.59pm on 11 February on the HDB Flat Portal.\n\nYou can \n\nTwo grandsons of OCBC Bank’s founding father Lee Kong Chian have bought big-ticket properties recently, noted the Business Times on Wednesday (11 Feb).\n\nBT’s report said Lee Shih Kwei is acquiring a freehold bungalow in Barker Road for $43.2 million. This follows the recent purchase of two units at the Seven Palms Sentosa Cove condominium for $23.9m by his brother Lee Shih Hua.\n\nKeir Starmer has told Jim Ratcliffe to apologise after the Manchester United co-owner claimed the UK is being “colonised” by immigrants.\n\nRatcliffe, who has lived in tax-free Monaco since 2020, made the comments in an interview with Sky News. “You can't have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in,\" he said. \"I mean, the UK has been colonised. It's costing too much money.”\n\nUK Prime Minister Starmer responded to the remarks on social media platform X, calling it “offensive and wrong.”\n\n“Britain is a proud, tolerant and diverse country. Jim Ratcliffe should apologise,” Starmer said.\n\nOffensive and wrong.\n\nBritain is a proud, tolerant and diverse country.\n\nJim Ratcliffe should apologise.https://t.co/7mSnVV33oo\n\n— Keir Starmer (@Keir_Starmer) February 11, 2026\n\nJames Van Der Beek, known for his starring role in the ‘Dawson’s Creek’ TV show, has died at the age of 48 following a battle with colorectal cancer.\n\nHis wife, Kimberly Van Der Beek, confirmed the sad news in an Instagram announcement on Wednesday (11 Feb). “Our beloved James David Van Der Beek passed peacefully this morning. He met his final days with courage, faith, and grace,” Kimberly said.\n\nShe added: “There is much to share regarding his wishes, love for humanity and the sacredness of time. Those days will come. For now we ask for peaceful privacy as we grieve our loving husband, father, son, brother, and friend.”\n\nVan Der Beek was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in August 2023. He only went public with his stage III cancer battle in November 2024.\n\nThe Philippine Embassy in Singapore says it has taken note of a video circulating online showing a man assaulting a Filipina at Lucky Plaza.\n\nThe Philippine Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) has also weighed in, adding that they are looking into the possibility of legal action, reports GMA News.\n\n“It’s assault, physical assault. It’s a crime anywhere in the world, especially in Singapore. We are looking into it and filing the necessary legal actions,” DMW Secretary Hans Cacdac was quoted as saying.\n\nThe woman has been identified as a Philippine national working in Singapore. It remains unclear what sparked the violent scenes.\n\n“The Embassy, through the Migrant Workers Office (MWO) and the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA), is taking appropriate measures and has reached out to the victim to provide the necessary assistance,” read a statement from The Philippine Embassy. “At this stage, we are mindful not to disclose details that could inadvertently affect ongoing measures or aggravate the situation.”",

    "title": "Psychology Says People Who Can’t Stand An Unmade Bed Share These 9 Habits That Predict Their Future Earnings",
    "description": "These shared habits of chronic bed-makers might predict their future income.",
    "fullText": "My partner thinks I'm insane because I make the bed every single morning. Even if we're running late. Even if I'm exhausted. Even if we're just going to get back in it twelve hours later.\n\nI can't help it. An unmade bed bothers me. Not in a cute, \"oh, I like things tidy\" way. In a visceral, \"I can't focus until this is done\" way.\n\nFor years, I thought this was just a quirk. Maybe a touch of OCD. But then I started noticing that most of the highly successful people I know also make their beds.\n\nI started paying attention. And I realized: people who can't stand unmade beds share a very specific set of habits. Habits that show up everywhere. In their work. Their finances. Their entire approach to life.\n\nAnd those habits? They're the same ones that consistently predict higher earnings and career success. Here's what psychologists have found about people who make their beds—and what it reveals about how they operate in the world.\n\nPeople who make their beds don't just make their beds.\n\nThey put dishes in the dishwasher right away.\n\nThey respond to emails as they come in.\n\nThey handle the little stuff immediately instead of letting it accumulate into an overwhelming pile.\n\nResearch on task completion and productivity found that people who immediately handle small, low-effort tasks report higher overall productivity and lower stress. The cumulative effect of completing minor tasks creates momentum that carries into larger projects.\n\nAnd that habit translates directly to earnings. Because at work, the person who handles small tasks immediately is the person who doesn't drop balls. Who doesn't have a backlog. Who can be trusted to follow through. And that reliability is what gets people promoted and raises their earning potential over time.\n\nMaking the bed is the first thing they accomplish each day. Before coffee. Before checking their phone. Before anything else. They wake up and immediately complete something.\n\nAnd that sets a tone. It creates a sense of momentum. A feeling of \"I've already done something today.\" That psychological boost—starting the day with a win—affects everything that comes after.\n\nStudies tracking morning routines and achievement show that people who begin their day by completing a task, no matter how small, report higher motivation and goal completion rates throughout the day. The act of finishing something early creates a productivity feedback loop.\n\nPeople who start their day with completion tend to end it with more completion. And over time, that compounds. More things finished means more projects delivered. More deliverables mean more recognition. More recognition means higher earnings.\n\nPeople who make their beds every day aren't making them because they feel inspired to make beds. They're making them because it's the thing that happens after they wake up. Motivation has nothing to do with it.\n\nAnd that's how they operate with everything. They don't wait to feel like doing something. They just do it because it's what needs doing. They've separated action from emotion.\n\nResearch on high performers across industries consistently shows that reliance on motivation correlates with lower achievement, while execution independent of emotional state predicts higher earnings. The people who wait to feel like working get less done than the people who work regardless of how they feel.\n\nThe person who doesn't need to feel motivated to perform is the person who's consistent, delivers regardless of their mood, and can be counted on even when things are hard or boring or unrewarding. That consistency is what careers are made of.\n\nThe thing about making your bed every day is that some days you really don't want to. You're exhausted. You're late. You're not feeling it. But they do it anyway.\n\nBecause it's not about wanting to. It's about the system. And they stick to systems even when it's inconvenient.\n\nResearch on self-discipline and financial success shows that people who maintain routines regardless of motivation or mood accumulate significantly more wealth over their lifetimes. The ability to execute on systems when you don't feel like it is a stronger predictor of earnings than talent or intelligence.\n\nThey're the ones who keep working when everyone else has checked out. Who maintain standards when it would be easier not to. Who show up consistently even when they're not inspired. And consistency is what builds careers and bank accounts.\n\nIf you can't stand an unmade bed, you notice when things are off—you see the crooked pillow, the wrinkled duvet, the corner that's not tucked properly. That attention to detail doesn't stop at bedding.\n\nThey notice typos in presentations.\n\nThings that other people miss because they're not looking that closely.\n\nIn professional settings, that's valuable. They catch mistakes before they become problems. They deliver work that doesn't need to be redone. And people who consistently deliver high-quality, detail-oriented work get paid more.\n\nMaking the bed isn't really about the bed. It's about creating order in their environment so they can think clearly. They've learned that external chaos creates internal chaos. So they control what they can control.\n\nStudies on environmental psychology found that people who actively manage their physical spaces report better focus, lower anxiety, and higher task completion rates. The act of creating order externally helps them maintain order internally.\n\nThis translates to earnings because they're more productive. They're not wasting mental energy on clutter or disorder or distracted by their environment. They've set themselves up to focus on what actually matters. And focused people outperform distracted people every single time.\n\nNobody's checking whether they made their bed. There's no bed-making police. No one would know or care if they skipped it. But they do it anyway.\n\nBecause they made a commitment to themselves. And they keep commitments even when no one's watching.\n\nResearch tracking integrity and professional success shows that people who maintain private commitments—promises made only to themselves—demonstrate higher rates of advancement and earnings. The ability to follow through when there's no external accountability is rare and highly valued.\n\nThat integrity shows up at work—they're the ones who finish the project even when the boss isn't checking. They're trusted to do what needs to be done without supervision; that trustworthiness is what gets people into positions of higher responsibility and higher pay.\n\nAnd that habit prevents the chaos that tanks so many people's careers. They're not juggling fifteen half-finished projects. They're not constantly putting out fires they created by not finishing things properly the first time. They close loops. And people who close loops get more opportunities, more responsibility, and more money because they can actually be counted on to finish what they start.\n\nMaking the bed every morning means one less decision. They don't spend mental energy every day deciding whether to make it. The decision was made once, and now it's automatic.\n\nAnd they do this with everything. They have uniforms. Meal routines. Standard responses to common situations. They've automated the small stuff, so their brain is free for the big stuff.\n\nStudies on decision fatigue show that high earners systematically reduce trivial decisions, preserving cognitive resources for high-value choices. The mental energy saved from not deliberating over minor tasks compounds into better strategic thinking and problem-solving.\n\nThis is why they're effective at work. They're not wasting brainpower on things that don't matter. They've systematized the repetitive stuff and saved their thinking for the decisions that actually impact outcomes. And that efficiency means better performance, which means higher pay.\n\nIf something's broken or inefficient, they fix it. They don't just live with the drawer that sticks or the process that doesn't work. They don't develop workarounds. They address the actual problem.\n\nMaking the bed is the same mindset. The bed is unmade—that's a problem. They fix it. They don't just throw the comforter vaguely over it and call it good enough. They don't ignore it and hope someone else deals with it. They actually solve it.\n\nThis shows up everywhere in their professional lives. They're the ones who fix the broken process instead of complaining about it. They identify inefficiencies and actually address them instead of just working around them. They take ownership of problems even when it's not technically their job.\n\nThat proactive problem-solving is what gets people promoted. Organizations are full of people who complain about problems and very few people who actually fix them. The people who fix things without being asked? They're the ones who end up running things. And getting paid accordingly.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Activists planned protests at more than two dozen Target stores around the United States on Wednesday to pressure the discount retailer into taking a public stand against the 5-week-old immigration crackdown in its home state of Minnesota.\n\nICE Out Minnesota, a coalition of community groups, religious leaders, labor unions and other critics of the federal operation, called for sit-ins and other demonstrations to continue at Target locations for a full week. Target's headquarters are located in Minneapolis, where federal officers last month killed two residents who had participated in anti-ICE protests, and its name adorns the city's major league baseball stadium and an arena where its basketball teams plays.\n\n“They claim to be part of the community, but they are not standing up to ICE,” said Elan Axelbank, a member of the Minnesota chapter of Socialist Alternative, which describes itself as a revolutionary political group. He organized a Wednesday protest outside a Target store in Minneapolis' Dinkytown commercial district.\n\nDemonstrations also were scheduled in St. Paul, Minnesota, Boston, Chicago, Honolulu, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Raleigh, North Carolina, San Diego, Seattle and other cities, as well as in suburban areas of Minnesota, California and Massachusetts. Target declined Wednesday to comment on the protests.\n\nTarget first became a bull's-eye for critics of the Trump administration's surge in immigration enforcement activity after a widely-circulated video showed federal agents detaining two Target employees in a store in the Minneapolis suburb of Richfield last month. Luis Argueta, a spokesperson for Unidos Minnesota, an immigrant-led social justice advocacy organization that is part of the ICE Out Minnesota coalition, said his group is focusing its protests on the Richfield store.\n\nOne of the demands of Wednesday’s protests is for Target to deny federal agents entry to stores unless they have judicial warrants authorizing arrests.\n\nSome lawyers have argued that anyone, including U.S. Border Patrol and Immigration and Customers Enforcement agents without signed warrants, can enter public areas of a business as they wish. Public areas include restaurant dining sections, open parking lots, office lobbies and shopping aisles, but not back offices, closed-off kitchens or other areas of a business that are generally off-limits to the public and where privacy would be reasonably expected, those lawyers say.\n\nTarget has not commented publicly on the detention of the store employees. CEO Michael Fiddelke, who became Target's chief executive on Feb. 2, sent a video message to the company’s 400,000 workers two days after a Border Patrol agent and a Customs and Border Protection officer shot and killed Minneapolis resident Alex Pretti on Jan. 24.\n\nFiddelke said the “violence and loss of life in our community is incredibly painful,\" but he did not mention the immigration crackdown or the fatal shootings of Pretti, an ICU nurse at a medical center for U.S. veterans in Minneapolis, and Renee Good, a mother of three fired on in her car by an ICE agent.\n\nFiddelke was one of 60 CEOs of Minnesota-based companies who, in the wake of Pretti's death, signed an open letter \"calling for an immediate de-escalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions.”\n\nThe protests over its alleged failure to oppose the immigration crackdown in Minnesota come a year after Target faced protests and boycotts over the company's decision to roll back its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. At the time, critics said the decision marked a betrayal of Target's retail giant’s philanthropic commitment to fighting racial disparities and promoting progressive values in liberal Minneapolis and beyond.\n\nThe retail chain also is struggling with a persistent sales malaise. Critics have complained of disheveled stores that are missing the budget-priced flair that long ago earned the retailer the nickname “Tarzhay.”\n\nWhile Wednesday's protests targeted a tiny fraction of the company's nearly 2,000 stores, the negative attention serves as another distraction from Target's business, according to Neil Saunders, managing director of the retail division of market research firm GlobalData.\n\n“The agenda has been hijacked by this,” Saunders said. “And it is a bit of a distraction for Target that they’d rather not have.\"\n\nIn recent days, a national coalition of Mennonite congregations organized roughly a dozen demonstrations inside and outside of Target stores across the country, singing and urging Target to publicly call Congress to defund Immigration and Customs Enforcement among other demands.\n\nA spokesperson for Mennonite Action said the coalition was not formally connected to ICE Out but following the lead of organizers in Minneapolis.\n\nThe Rev. Joanna Lawrence Shenk, associate pastor at First Mennonite Church of San Francisco, said the group did not plan any actions on Wednesday but was mapping out weekend singalong events at Targets in a handful of towns and cities, including Pittsburgh and Harrisonburg, Virginia. She estimated that by the end of the weekend more than 1,000 congregation members will have participated.\n\nShenk noted that the Mennonites sing “This Little Light of Mine” and other gospel songs and hymns.\n\n“The singing was an expression of our love for immigrant neighbors who are at risk right now and who are also a part of our congregation,” she said. “For us, it’s not just standing in solidarity with others but it’s also protecting people who are vulnerable.”",

    "fullText": "Six US states are pushing legislation to put a moratorium on artificial intelligence (AI) data center construction.\n\nYahoo Finance Breaking Business News Reporter Jake Conley joins Market Domination Overtime host Josh Lipton to outline the details of these bills and the potential ramifications down the road.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime.\n\nWhich states are pushing back and why are they pushing back?\n\nYeah, Josh, you've got six states with bills being considered right now. You've got Oklahoma, Vermont, and Maryland, but also three major hubs, New York, Georgia, and Virginia, home to Data Center alley in the Lowden area.\n\nThose back three have been huge sites of development. These bills are structured in a few different ways, but the basic underlying principle\n\nis that they look to put a moratorium on data center development. Essentially saying from roughly one year to a roughly three-year window,\n\nyou cannot develop here, you cannot build here until certain hurdles are met or until we get a pipeline cleaned up of requests or ex-conditions are met.\n\nBut essentially this is saying to those developers, these states, if these bills pass, will be walled off to you.\n\nAnd the the real argument here is infrastructure strain. These data centers suck up a lot of energy. They suck up a lot of water. That's going to put pressure on rate payers bills. You already see electricity bills hiking in these areas that have had a lot of development.\n\nYou see water strain in those areas. The grid is under a lot of stress. And so lawmakers are now trying to get ahead of that and saying, wait, wait, wait, slow down. Let's get some stuff on the books, get some regulations in place. But to do that, we want a breather.\n\nWhat what are the chances uh that these bills actually do pass, Jake?\n\nThey're going to face an uphill battle for a few reasons. You got to remember these data centers bring jobs. They bring tax revenue.\n\nAlso, the companies that are behind these centers, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, these aren't easy to push aside. These are companies with real political heft and firepower, with real pressure. And a lot of these governors are at least nominally pro-development.\n\nSo the argument they're going to come up against from these data center developers is, hey, we're bringing you jobs. We're bringing you revenue. Why would you stop us from building? And they're going to face that same kind of push back from business interests, business lobby.\n\nEven if these bills don't go through, you could still see and probably still will see some kind of regulation, cost sharing agreements, water usage parameters. But the focus right now because of their top line impact is on these moratoriums.\n\nHow much, Jake final question, could this all sort of disrupt the great AI ambitions and dreams of Big Tech?\n\nI think the rule with the hyper scales right now is speed, right? There's an arms race going on. You see these companies spending hundreds of billions of dollars on building out this infrastructure. And the game here right now for for Microsoft, for Google, for all these companies building these out is speed.\n\nHow fast can we get these things put up to power the compute that we're trying to put into the market. Any kind of delay there is going to hurt those companies and slow them down.\n\nI was talking to someone today who works in site selection advising these companies on where to go. She was telling me you're already seeing people inside these companies take a second look at some of these spots and say maybe that's not the right idea. Maybe we go somewhere\n\nwith less laws on the rest proposals on the books. The problem is those areas have less infrastructure. So you're going to run into problems wherever you go.\n\nBut regardless, especially in these kind of bigger sites, bigger states where a lot of this development is happening, when the rule of speed, anything that's going to slow speed down is going to be detrimental.\n\nAll right, big story. Thank you Jake for covering it. Appreciate it. Thanks.",

    "fullText": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Nebraska's Republican secretary of state will turn over sensitive information on every registered voter in the state to the U.S. Justice Department on Thursday after Nebraska's highest court rejected a legal effort to block the move.\n\nSecretary of State Bob Evnen told The Associated Press that the Nebraska Supreme Court denied the injunction Wednesday.\n\nLast week, a state judge dismissed the lawsuit filed by government watchdog Common Cause, which sought to stop the release of voter information, including dates of birth, addresses and partial Social Security numbers, to the federal government.\n\n“This case threatens the unprecedented and unlawful release of highly sensitive information of every Nebraska voter,” lawyers for Common Cause wrote in a brief seeking the injunction. “Once the data is released, that bell cannot be unrung.”\n\nThe legal fight in Nebraska comes in the wake of an FBI raid that saw it seize 2020 ballots and other election documents from Georgia’s Fulton County and President Donald Trump declaring he wants to “take over” elections from Democratic-run areas with the November midterms on the horizon.\n\nThe federal Justice Department began last year pushing states to turn over their voter data and other election information. The department has sued at least 23 states and the District of Columbia in its effort to obtain voter rolls.\n\nEvnen said Wednesday that he's giving voter information to the Justice Department so it can assess whether Nebraska is complying with federal voting laws. He noted that the Nebraska Attorney General's office had advised that the federal request “was lawful and proper.”\n\nHis office will upload the information electronically to the Justice Department, he said, and will include a request that privacy laws be observed.\n\nIn a written statement released by his office, Evnen said he is dedicated to protecting voters' personally identifiable information from misuse.\n\nBut when asked if he was positive that Nebraska voter information would be kept secure and not lead to legitimate voters being kicked off voter roles, Evnen responded, “The only thing I'm positive of is that the sun won't catch in a tree when it sets tonight.”\n\nEvnen said the state would not remove people from voter rolls based solely on Department of Justice recommendations. Instead, election officials would conduct their own investigation and would first contact anyone tagged for removal from the rolls.\n\nEarlier this week, a federal judge rejected the department's effort to obtain Michigan’s voter rolls.\n\nThe Justice Department has said it's seeking the data as part of an effort to ensure election security, but Democratic officials say the demand violates state and federal privacy laws. Election officials have raised concerns that federal officials are trying to use the sensitive data for other purposes, such as searching for potential noncitizens on the rolls.\n\nElections in the United States are administered at the state and local level, where individual voter information is kept.",

    "fullText": "Costco’s beloved $1.50 hot dog combo has long been a symbol of unbeatable value at the warehouse club, but now that iconic deal comes with a twist that’s catching shoppers off guard. While the price and classic pairing of a hot dog and soda remain unchanged, the company is tightening the rules on who can actually order it. Find out what you need to know before you next stroll through the food court, and whether this move could change how you enjoy one of Costco’s most famous bargains.\n\nWhile Costco frequently rotates its menu — swapping out sandwiches or debuting a new cookie to keep the bakery crowd curious — certain icons are considered sacred. At the heart of this “hands-off” list is the legendary $1.50 hot dog and soda combo. This deal is more than just a snack; it’s a corporate mandate.\n\nFounder Jim Sinegal’s legendary defense of the price point remains the stuff of retail folklore. As CNBC reported, Sinegal famously said, “If you raise the effing hot dog, I will kill you. Figure it out.” Management has clearly “figured it out,” but not by raising the price. Instead, they are narrowing the guest list.\n\nCostco has spent the last year tightening its borders. What started with digital scanners at warehouse entrances has now officially migrated to the food court. While the public once enjoyed a “gray area” access to those $1.50 franks, especially at outdoor windows, the food court favorite will soon be exclusive to Costco members.\n\nAccording to Sporked, “Costco is rolling out membership-verification technology at its food courts that will require customers to show a valid membership card before ordering food, something select locations have already started testing, and that could become more widespread in 2026.”\n\nSince 2024, Reddit users have been documenting the shift, sharing photos of signs that make the new barrier to entry crystal clear. One such sign reads: “Effective April 8, 2024, an active Costco membership card will be required to purchase items from our food court. You can join today. Please see our membership counter for details.”\n\nTo streamline this enforcement, many locations are now integrating card readers directly into the kiosks. Before you can even order any food, you’ll likely need to swipe or scan your active membership.\n\nThe reasoning behind the move is simple: exclusivity. In a statement reported by Audacy.com, the company explained their stance: “We don’t feel it’s right that nonmembers receive the same benefits and pricing as our members.”",

    "fullText": "There are two fewer places to grab a quick bite near downtown Fresno and Highway 99.\n\nThe KFC and Wendy’s on C and Fresno streets — which operated next door to each other for years — are now closed. The windows are boarded up and the buildings are surrounded by chain-link fence. The signs are gone, only the metal frames remaining. Weeds are starting to grow.\n\nNeither the local management nor the parent company returned messages seeking comment about the closures, which happened in recent weeks.\n\nBut Wendy’s is in the process of closing hundreds of underperforming locations nationwide. It started the closures last year .\n\nIt could close between 240 and 360 restaurants, according to ABC news. It follows a tide of 140 Wendy’s closures that ended in 2024.\n\nThe most recent closures include locations owned by franchisees, said Ken Cook, interim chief executive officer, when announcing the cutbacks in the 2025 third-quarter earnings call in November.\n\nThe underperforming restaurants are a financial drag on the brand, he said. The shutdowns are expected to boost sales at nearby Wendy’s, he said.\n\n“In (some) cases, the solution will be to close consistently underperforming restaurants,” he said in the call. “These actions will strengthen the system and enable franchisees to invest more capital and resources in their remaining restaurants.”\n\nThe closures are a reaction to Wendy’s sales falling 4.7% according to its latest quarterly report. Its rivals, including McDonald’s and Burger King, saw sales rise.\n\nLast month, Wendy’s in Selma, and on Dinuba Boulevard in Visalia also closed, according to the Mid Valley Times.\n\nNo additional Wendy’s locations have been identified for closure in Fresno. JEM Restaurant Management, which owns numerous Wendy’s and KFC franchises in Fresno, did not immediately return calls seeking comment.\n\nWendy’s still has a healthy presence in town, with seven restaurants open in Fresno and one in Clovis.\n\nThe KFC at 1110 C St. has also closed.\n\nIt follows the closure of three other locations in Fresno: The “Next-gen” location Herndon and Spruce avenues, another at First Street and Bullard Avenue, and one at Dakota and West avenues.\n\nAll were owned by JEM Restaurant Management.\n\nThe classic fried chicken chain has struggled in recent years with slipping sales. But the last two quarters, KFC has turned things around, squeezing out an increase in sales.\n\nKFC has six locations in Fresno and two in Clovis.",

    "description": "Believers see Jesus Christ’s face in the Shroud of Turin. But a new study says it’s something else—in fact, it may be no man at all.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA recent study offers new insight into the origin of an object known as the Shroud of Turin.\n\nMany consider the sheet to be a holy relic, marked with the impression of a dying man they believe to be Jesus Christ.\n\nUsing open-source 3D modeling software, one researcher showed that, had the cloth really been laid on a real human being, the impression it left would have looked markedly different than what is actually on the sheet\n\nThis story is a collaboration with Biography.com.\n\nThe Shroud of Turin has been the subject of fascination for both believers and skeptics alike since its existence was first recorded in the 14th century.\n\nThe cloth in question appears to depict the face and body of an adult man with long hair and a beard—very similar to style in which Jesus Christ has traditionally been depicted since roughly the 6th century A.D. This outline, while faintly apparent to the naked eye, becomes undeniable when viewed in a photographic negative. As such, there is little doubt now that the face people see on the Shroud of Turin is indeed a deliberate depiction, rather than a trick of the eye as some other ecstatic religious visions can sometimes prove to be. The question, instead, is how that impression got there to begin with.\n\nNow, thanks to one determined researcher and some open-source software, we might finally have found the answer.\n\nThose who believe in the authenticity of the relic suggest that it was the very cloth wrapped around the body of Jesus after his crucifixion, and his divine nature left this eternal impression of his visage.\n\nBut objections have long been raised against this hypothesis—and not just within the secular space. Perhaps the most famous denunciation of the Shroud of Turin came from John Calvin, the 16th-century French theologian who became the namesake of Calvinism. In his Treatise on Relics, he responds almost mockingly to the assertions of the Shroud’s divine origins, asking:\n\n“How is it possible that those sacred historians, who carefully related all the miracles that took place at Christ’s death, should have omitted to mention one so remarkable as the likeness of the body of our Lord remaining on its wrapping sheet? This fact undoubtedly deserved to be recorded.”\n\nCalvin cites several Biblical reasons as to why this couldn’t have happened—from the fact that none of the disciples ever mentioned seeing such an impression on the shroud, to the fact that the Roman soldiers weren’t exactly on friendly terms with the Followers of Christ, so it’s unlikely they would have let them abscond with such a sacred item. Plus, he notes, St. John said that Jesus was buried “according to the manner of the Jews.” Were this in fact the case, the body and head would have been wrapped with two separate cloths, not one.\n\n“In short,” Calvin concluded, “...either St John is a liar, or all those who boast of possessing the holy sudary are convicted of falsehood and deceit.”\n\nCalvin didn’t go so far as to posit an alternative theory. Perhaps he didn’t want to speculate. Perhaps he was simply too busy to spend time on the subject—he did have a lot of writing to do (and at least one soon-to-be-set-on-fire heretic to testify against).\n\nOr maybe he just didn’t have access to open-source software like Blender.\n\nThankfully, Cicero Moraes—a researcher and 3D designer from Brazil—did have that software handy. And he used it to test a theory first posited by Walter McCrone in the 1980s: that the image on the Shroud of Turin isn’t an impression at all, but rather “an inspired painting,” perhaps made in part by using a low-relief sculpture rather than a full three-dimensional figure.\n\nAt the core of this theory is one idea: had the cloth received its markings from a three-dimensional figure, the image of the face and body would appear flattened and distorted on the unfolded cloth.\n\nTo prove this, Moraes created a model in the software MakeHuman under the parameters “male, adult, ≈33 years old, thin and ≈1.80m tall.” Then, he transferred that model over to the free, open-source software Blender in order to refine the details to match the figure on the Shroud of Turin.\n\nMoraes then compared how a fabric wrapped around that three-dimensional model would look (compared to one laid on a low-relief sculpture), and what type of pattern both would leave.\n\nMoraes models demonstrated that, when a three-dimensional object does leave marks on a piece of fabric, those stains “generate a more robust and more deformed structure in relation to the source.” What you’re seeing when you look at an impression made of a human face on a piece of fabric is a flattening of a three-dimensional object.\n\nIf you were to take, say, a globe, slather it with ink, and wrap a cloth around it, when you unfolded that sheet, you’d find an image that looked a good deal different than the globe's rounded shape.\n\nBut if you’d rather not get your perfectly good globe dirty, you could just watch the video Moraes’ made to accompany his study notes. Anyone can test this out for themselves by covering their face with a pigmented liquid and laying a fabric or paper towel over it.\n\nThe details of Moraes’ findings have been published in an article for Archaeometry, including acknowledgements of all of the software Moraes employed. It concludes that the image on the Shroud of Turin is almost certainly a work of medieval art, rather than an authentic impression from a dying man.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

He was initially transported to Portsmouth Regional Hospital but has since been flown to a Boston area hospital due to the extent of his injuries, police said in a late-afternoon update.\n\nA passerby in a car called police at 12:22 p.m. to report seeing a bleeding man lying on the ground on the property, according to Deputy Police Chief Michael Maloney.\n\nCrime scene tape was posted around the 1070 Lafayette Road property as city authorities investigated the scene.\n\nPolice did not disclose the man's condition.\n\nLt. Brian Houde stated previously there is no danger to the public associated with the incident. No further information was expected to be released Feb. 11, according to Maloney.\n\nPortsmouth Fire Chief Bill McQuillen deferred comment to city police.\n\nPortsmouth police are continuing to probe the incident. Members of the public are asked to contact Det. Capt. David Keaveny (603) 610-7511 with information pertaining to the incident.\n\nWalter Wakefield is the longtime owner of the now-defunct bookstore.

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A former federal prosecutor who quit amid a dispute with the Trump administration is now representing former CNN host Don Lemon, who was one of nine people indicted for their alleged roles in disrupting a service at a Minnesota church where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official was a pastor.\n\nA court filing Tuesday shows that Lemon has hired former interim U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, who had been leading the sprawling investigation and prosecution of major fraud cases for the Minnesota U.S. Attorney’s Office until he resigned last month.\n\nSeveral prosecutors have now left the office at a time of growing frustration with the administration’s immigration enforcement crackdown and the Justice Department’s response to fatal shootings of two people by federal officers in Minneapolis.\n\nLemon had previously said through another attorney that he planned to plead not guilty to federal civil rights charges over his coverage of the church protest. He has said he was not affiliated with the group that disrupted the church service, and that he was there in his capacity as an independent journalist. The indictment alleges various actions by the group that entered the church, including what Lemon said as he reported on the event for his livestream show.\n\nLemon is scheduled to be arraigned on Feb. 13 in federal court in St. Paul.\n\nThe Trump administration has cited the Minnesota fraud cases, in which most defendants have come from the state’s large Somali community, as justification for its immigration crackdown in the state. Thompson estimated in December that the losses to taxpayers from several fraud cases being prosecuted in Minnesota could total $9 billion.\n\nThompson recently formed his own law firm with Harry Jacobs, another former federal prosecutor who resigned amid the upheaval in the office. Jacobs had been lead prosecutor in the case of Vance Boelter, who has pleaded not guilty in last year's assassination of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the nonfatal shootings of a state senator and his wife.\n\nThe firm's website describes them as “battle tested and seasoned” trial lawyers.\n\nThompson did not immediately reply to messages seeking comment Tuesday.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump attacked the Republican leader of the National Governors Association on Wednesday as tensions mounted between the White House and the bipartisan group of state leaders ahead of ...",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump attacked the Republican leader of the National Governors Association on Wednesday as tensions mounted between the White House and the bipartisan group of state leaders ahead of its annual meeting next week.\n\nIn a social media post, Trump blasted Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican who chairs the NGA, as a “RINO,” meaning Republican in Name Only. Trump said Stitt “incorrectly stated my position on the very exclusive Governors Annual Dinner and Meeting at the White House.”\n\nThe dispute centers on whether Trump would allow governors from both major parties to participate in the full range of White House events, which typically includes a business meeting and meal. In a letter to fellow governors on Monday, Stitt said the NGA was informed that the White House planned to limit invitations to the business meeting to Republicans. That prompted an outcry from Democrats, who said they wouldn't participate in the meal if they weren’t fully included at the business meeting.\n\n“I am writing to inform you that President Donald J. Trump is inviting all governors of the 55 States and territories to the Friday, Feb. 20 NGA Business Breakfast at 8:30am est.,” Stitt wrote. “He was very clear in his communications with me that this is a National Governors Association’s event, and he looks forward to hosting you and hearing from governors across the country. President Donald Trump said this was always his intention, and we have addressed the misunderstanding in scheduling.”\n\nTrump, however, struck a far more adversarial tone in his social media post, calling Stitt's Monday letter “false.”\n\n“The invitations were sent to ALL Governors, other than two, who I feel are not worthy of being there,” he wrote, referring to Democratic Govs. Wes Moore of Maryland and Jared Polis of Colorado.\n\nTrump added: “I look forward to seeing the Republican Governors, and some of the Democrats Governors who were worthy of being invited, but most of whom won’t show up.”\n\nFollowing Trump's post, Brandon Tatum, the NGA's chief executive, stood by the group's timeline of events.\n\n“As of Tuesday evening, only Republican Governors received invites from the White House for the Friday morning business meeting,” he said in a statement. “We are hopeful that we can have constructive bipartisan dialogue with the President during the session. Continuing the tradition of the business meeting is an important step toward bridge building among parties.”\n\nFor now, it's unclear how many Democrats will show up at the White House. Some, including Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, said Wednesday they didn't plan to attend the meeting. Others, such as Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut, signaled they would participate.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that Trump has “discretion to invite anyone he wants to the White House.”\n\nThe spat is a reminder of the challenge facing bipartisan or nonpartisan organizations in Trump's Washington. The U.S. Conference of Mayors, which includes city leaders from both parties, met in Washington earlier this month but wasn't invited to the White House.\n\nThe governor's meeting, typically a low-key event, took a sharper edge last year when Trump returned to the White House.\n\nThe president singled out Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, over his administration's effort to bar transgender athletes from competing in girls’ and women’s sports. He threatened to withhold federal funding from the state if she did not comply, prompting Mills to retort, “We’ll see you in court.”\n\nTrump predicted that Mills’ political career would be over for opposing the order, though she is now running for U.S. Senate on a staunch anti-Trump agenda.\n\nThe back-and-forth had a lasting impact on last year’s conference and some Democratic governors did not renew their dues last year to the bipartisan group.",

    "fullText": "James Van Der Beek's tragic death at 48 has reignited urgent questions about what may be fueling the rise of aggressive colon cancer in younger adults.\n\nAs doctors examine possible risk factors, new research suggests that even a single daily sugary drink could be linked to late-stage disease, raising concerns about a habit millions consider harmless.\n\nThe death of James Van Der Beek at age 48 stunned fans and reignited urgent conversations about colorectal cancer in younger adults.\n\nOnce considered a disease primarily affecting older populations, colon cancer has been steadily rising among people under 50.\n\nSince the 1990s, early-onset cases have surged by 50 percent, and projections suggest rates could double between 2010 and 2030.\n\nColorectal cancer now ranks as the fourth most common cancer in the United States and the second-leading cause of cancer deaths.\n\nThe American Cancer Society estimates that 154,270 Americans will be diagnosed this year, and 52,900 will die.\n\nIn the UK, more than 44,000 cases are diagnosed annually, with over 16,800 deaths each year.\n\nVan Der Beek's passing followed a public two-year battle with the disease. His loved ones shared the heartbreaking news in an emotional Instagram statement.\n\nIt read, \"Our beloved James David Van Der Beek passed peacefully this morning. He met his final days with courage, faith, and grace. There is much to share regarding his wishes, love for humanity, and the sacredness of time. Those days will come. For now, we ask for peaceful privacy as we grieve our loving husband, father, son, brother, and friend.\"\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Kimberly, and their six children.\n\nAmid growing concern, researchers have zeroed in on dietary patterns that may influence advanced disease.\n\nA new study suggests that consuming at least one sugary soda or candy every day could be linked specifically to late-stage colon cancer, the hardest-to-treat form.\n\nDr. Emma Schatoff, a medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who led the research, described what doctors were seeing in younger patients.\n\n\"Young people were coming in with metastatic disease, or cancer that had spread everywhere – it was in their liver, lungs, other organs – and they were very surprised,\" she told the Daily Mail.\n\nHer team examined numerous possible risk factors. She shared, \"We looked at anything that could have raised their risk level. We looked at inflammatory bowel disease and medication use, but found no difference there.\"\n\nThe results surprised even the researchers. Dr. Schatoff said, \"Then we looked at diet, and found no link with processed foods or red meat. But we did find a link with high sugar foods in stage four patients diagnosed with the disease for the first time.\"\n\nSchatoff clarified what the researchers meant by high sugar intake. She said, \"We defined a high sugar diet as daily consumption of high sugar foods, such as a [single] soda or a candy.\"\n\nThe study followed 303 colon cancer patients under 50 years old. Among them, 112 were diagnosed with stage four cancer, while 191 had stages one through three.\n\nEach participant completed a detailed dietary questionnaire that asked, \"Two to five years before diagnosis, how often did you have one serving of high sugar foods (eg soft drinks, candy).\"\n\nThe differences were striking. Forty-five percent of stage four patients reported daily consumption of high sugar foods, compared with just 29 percent in patients whose cancers had not spread as aggressively.\n\nThe researchers concluded, \"In a single-center study, in early-onset colon cancer patients, high sugar diets may be associated with de novo [new] metastatic disease.\"\n\nThe findings were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual conference in Chicago, attended by around 40,000 cancer specialists.\n\nWhile the results have been published as an abstract and have not yet undergone peer review in a scientific journal, they have intensified debate about sugar's role in disease progression.\n\nScientists suspect that sugar may alter the gut microbiome, the complex ecosystem of bacteria living in the digestive tract. Excess sugar that is not fully absorbed can accumulate in the colon, potentially increasing inflammation and fueling tumor growth. Some research suggests sugar may act as direct fuel for cancer cells, accelerating their expansion.\n\nA separate study last year found that diets high in sugar and low in fiber can promote the growth of Fusobacterium, a bacteria linked to inflammation and tumor development. Chronic inflammation can age cells and increase vulnerability to cancer-causing mutations.\n\nWhat makes these findings especially concerning is how common sugary beverages are.\n\nAccording to the CDC, an estimated 63 percent of American adults report consuming at least one soda per day. For many, it is simply part of routine life.\n\nYet the new research suggests that even one daily serving of a sugary drink or candy may be associated with more advanced disease at diagnosis.\n\nThe stage four patients in the study were slightly younger on average, 41 years old, compared to 43 years old in the earlier-stage group. Just over half of the participants were women, and none had a prior cancer diagnosis.\n\nThe study found no association between colon cancer and consumption of red meat, processed foods, fruits, vegetables, fish, poultry, or dairy.\n\nThat absence of links makes the sugar-specific findings particularly striking.\n\nAs conversations continue following James Van Der Beek's death, doctors emphasize that research is ongoing and that no single factor determines cancer risk.\n\nStill, the potential connection between daily sugar intake and advanced colon cancer adds another layer of urgency to understanding why more young adults are being diagnosed.\n\nFor families grappling with loss and patients confronting the disease, the message is sobering.\n\nWhat once seemed like a harmless indulgence may warrant closer scrutiny.\n\nAs awareness grows, researchers hope that uncovering these patterns will lead to earlier detection, better prevention strategies, and ultimately fewer stories like that of James Van Der Beek.",

    "title": "3 takeaways from Elon Musk's xAI all-hands, from a moon city to a company restructuring",
    "description": "Musk addressed the company for the first time since its merger with SpaceX and shared the plans for the company's restructuring.",
    "fullText": "XAI just had its first all-hands meeting since its merger with SpaceX.\n\nIn the recorded event on Tuesday night, CEO Elon Musk outlined a new organizational structure — the main Grok product and Grok Voice, Grok Code, Grok Imagine, and the company's Macrohard project. The all-hands was later posted on X on Wednesday.\n\nFrom a plan to build a catapult, or mass driver, on the moon to soothing nerves after the restructuring, here are the main takeaways from xAI's latest all-hands meeting.\n\nThere are now only six members left of an original founding team of 12 at xAI, following two more exits earlier this week.\n\nMusk addressed the new restructuring.\n\n\"Because we've reached a certain scale, we're organizing the company to be more effective at this scale,\" said Musk. \"Now, naturally, when this happens, there are some people who are better suited for the early stages of a company and less suited for the later stages.\"\n\nOn Monday, Tony Wu announced his resignation in a post on X, writing that it was \"time for my next chapter.\" Less than 24 hours later, fellow cofounder Jimmy Ba followed suit, posting that Tuesday was his last day and thanking Musk for \"bringing us together on this incredible journey.\"\n\nMusk is promising the moon, literally.\n\n\"Ultimately, we see a path to maybe launching as much as a terawatt per year of compute from earth, but what if you want to go beyond a mere terawatt per year?\" said Musk. \"In order to do that, you have to go to the moon.\"\n\nHis goal is to launch AI sattelites from the moon, he told employees.\n\n\"I can't imagine anything more epic than a mass driver on the moon and a self-sustaining city on the moon, and then going beyond the moon to Mars, going throughout our solar system, and ultimately being out there among the stars and visiting all these star systems,\" Musk added. \"Maybe we'll meet aliens.\"\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai is also researching the feasability of data centers in space, citing limited resources on Earth, such as water and electricity. Data centers are already facing backlash for driving up utility costs for average households.\n\nA stand-alone app for XChat and a new transaction app called X Money are coming in the next few months, according to Musk.\n\nDuring the all-hands meeting, Musk said that users who only want to use the messaging function could use the standalone XChat app without visiting the X platform. He said the app will also be on desktop and can handle multi-user video calls.\n\n\"For XMoney, we actually had XMoney live in closed beta within the company, and we expect in the next month or two to go to a limited external beta and then to go worldwide to all X users,\" said Musk.\n\n\"And this is really intended to be the place where all the money is, the central source of all monetary transactions,\" Musk added. \"So it's really going to be a game changer.\"",

    "description": "US mogul skier Tess Johnson credits her daily habit as \"just a way to stay present and get off my phone from time to time.\"",
    "fullText": "Olympic skier Tess Johnson, 25, starts and ends every day with the same ritual that helps her perform under pressure.\n\nIn an interview with Town & Country Magazine published on Wednesday, the American mogul skier said she always packs her journal when she travels for competitions.\n\n\"I do a little bit of journaling in the morning to set my day, set my goals for the day and a little bit of gratitude, but then in the evening I let it all out and it's a little bit like word vomit, but whatever I need to just get out to get a good night of sleep,\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson made the US national team at 14 — the youngest athlete to do so at the time — and later became the youngest American freestyle skier to medal at the World Championships.\n\nShe debuted at the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics and reached the finals at the 2026 Milan Cortina Games, where she finished 10th.\n\nJohnson, whose grandfather was a former Sports Illustrated writer who covered the Olympics, said journaling plays a key role in her mental preparation.\n\nShe believes she inherited her love of writing from her grandfather and now uses journaling as a practical training tool to track her progress in skiing.\n\n\"And also an emotional tool to just work through whatever anxieties are happening because this is a very intense sport and process that we're going through,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"It's really helpful to get it all out on paper and sift through it just by putting pen to paper. So it does a lot for me. And at the very least, it's just a way to stay present and get off my phone from time to time,\" she continued.\n\nJohnson added that she occasionally rereads her old journals, including those from the 2018 Olympics.\n\n\"It's really cool to see the progress I've made over the years,\" she said.\n\nApart from being a part of her daily routine, journaling is also a key part of her pre-race ritual.\n\n\"The night before I like to journal, whatever in training that day, any other thoughts that I need to get out. Then the morning of, I'll write down three goals for the day, usually relating to my skiing or a mental performance goal, or just something even maybe not related to skiing, just that I have for the day, and then I'll write down a couple things that I'm grateful for as well,\" Johnson said, adding that she does her warm ups after that.\n\nJohnson isn't the only elite athlete who has embraced journaling as part of their routine.\n\nMichael Phelps told Business Insider in 2023 that he uses writing to reflect and unwind, while WNBA star Caitlin Clark has incorporated journaling into her pregame ritual to clear her head and stay focused.\n\nMeanwhile, other Olympians are leaning into surprisingly old-school hobbies in their downtime, including cross-country skier Ben Ogden, who said knitting helps him relax.",

    "description": "Russian authorities said two major airlines were flying one-way flights out of Cuba, as the Trump administration pressures the island's oil supply.",
    "fullText": "Moscow's civil aviation authority said on Wednesday that two major Russian airlines are helping to repatriate its citizens from Cuba amid a jet fuel shortage on the island.\n\nThe agency, Rosaviatsia, said that Rossiya Airlines had changed its flight schedule \"to ensure the evacuation of Russian tourists currently in Cuba.\"\n\nRossiya, which is owned by Russian aviation giant Aeroflot, and Nordwind Airlines, a Russian luxury airline, announced on the same day that they would suspend flights to Cuba and offer only one-way tickets out of the island.\n\nAll parties cited \"difficulties with refueling aircraft in Cuba.\"\n\n\"Starting February 12, a number of one-way return flights will be operated from Havana and Varadero to Moscow to accommodate Russian tourists currently in Cuba,\" wrote Rossiya Airlines.\n\nNordwind Airlines, a Russian leisure airline, said it would fly only repatriation flights from the resort locations of Varadero, Holguin, and Cayo Coco.\n\nThe Russian Union of Travel Industry estimated last week that at least 4,000 Russian tourists are in Cuba.\n\nThe announcements came after Cuban aviation authorities warned on Monday that the island would not have jet fuel available at international airports for a month.\n\nCuba heavily depends on Venezuela for oil, but has stopped receiving imports since January 3, when Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was captured by US forces.\n\nMexico ranks in distant second place as an oil supplier to Cuba, but it also halted exports to the island after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on countries that send oil to Havana.\n\nCanadian airlines, which run some of the highest-traffic routes to Cuba, said they were canceling flights to the island from Monday onward. Air Canada, WestJet, and Air Transat said they would fly empty planes to Cuba to pick up passengers.\n\nThe Russian airlines are following suit.\n\nRossiya said in a follow-up statement that it was organizing at least six one-way flights from Cuban airports to Moscow, and that it would suspend all operations to the island nation by February 24.\n\nBoth Rossiya and Nordwind said they were offering refunds to affected passengers.\n\n\"Both parties are exploring alternative options to resume flights in both directions in the interests of citizens of both countries,\" Rosaviatsia wrote.\n\nCuba has long been considered a close ally of Moscow and a stronghold of Soviet and Russian influence in Latin America.\n\nRussia, isolated by international sanctions for its war against Ukraine, has recently sought to expand economic and trade ties with Cuba, encouraging Russian companies in banking, agriculture, IT, and other industries to begin operations on the island.\n\nIn September, Ukrainian intelligence officials said that the Kremlin recruited over 20,000 Cuban citizens as mercenaries to fight Kyiv's forces, with the island ranking among the top suppliers of foreign fighters.\n\nTrump said earlier this month that his administration was in discussions with Cuba as he ramps up pressure on the island.\n\n\"I think we're going to make a deal with Cuba,\" he told reporters.\n\nRussia is not the only one to chafe at Cuba's situation. On Tuesday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said at a press briefing that Beijing \"stands firmly against the inhumane actions that deprive the Cuban people of their right to subsistence and development.\"\n\n\"China will, as always, do our best to provide support and assistance to Cuba,\" said spokesperson Lin Jian.",

    "description": "A bipartisan coalition in the House delivered a rare rebuke of Trump's tariffs by voting against his duties on Canada, citing economic concerns.",
    "fullText": "The US and Canada relationship has been tense since President Donald Trump took office a second time and began levvying tariffs on the neighbor to the north and throwing around the term \"51st state.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Congress delivered a rare bipartisan rebuke of Trump's tariffs on Canada — even as the president escalated the spat this week.\n\nOn Wednesday, the House voted to block Trump's tariffs on Canada by passing a resolution introduced by Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York that would rescind the tariffs Trump imposed on the neighbor under a national emergency declaration.\n\nAs tensions with the US's closest trading partner continue to escalate, the measure cleared the chamber 219 to 211, with six Republicans joining Democrats to defy Trump and GOP leadership. One Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, voted against it.\n\nThe vote came a day after Republican leaders failed to block the effort through a procedural maneuver, when three GOP lawmakers sided with Democrats to allow debate to move forward. Trump publicly warned Republicans not to cross him and threatened political retaliation against anyone who voted against tariffs.\n\n\"Any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social ahead of the vote.\n\nBoth Republicans who defected and Democrats cite economic impacts as their primary reason for opposing tariffs.\n\n\"Today's vote is simple, very simple: Will you vote to lower the cost of living for the American family or will you keep prices high out of loyalty to one person, Donald J. Trump?\" said Meeks, who authored the resolution, ahead of the vote.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat, said in a statement after the vote that \"sycophantic Republicans in the House have tried to block us from acting on behalf of the American people\" and that Trump's tariffs were \"causing prices to skyrocket and creating unnecessary uncertainty for American families\".\n\n\"As an old fashioned Conservative I know tariffs are a tax on American consumers,\" said Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, who voted against tariffs on Canada alongside the Democrats. Bacon will be retiring and won't seek reelection in the midterm.\n\nThe resolution now heads to the Senate. But even if it passes, Trump is expected to veto it, making the effort largely symbolic.\n\nThe congressional rebellion comes as Trump's dispute with Canada intensifies. In January, Trump threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Canada after Prime Minister Mark Carney reached a trade agreement with China, which offered China a quota for EV exports in exchange for certain agricultural tariffs on Canada being dropped. Trump then threatened to block the opening of a new bridge between Michigan and Ontario, and demanded some ownership of the bridge that Canada paid for.\n\nThough a conversation between Carney and Trump has de-escalated threats on the bridge, it is clear that sentiment toward the US in Canada has soured.\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada, Canadians returning to Canada after traveling in the US took a dive in early 2025 and are down about a quarter from the year before as of November 2025. After Canadian provinces launched a boycott against American alcohol products, US spirits exports to Canada plummeted 85% in the second quarter of 2025 and fell below $10 million in export value, according to the Distilled Spirits Council.",

    "fullText": "You're not the only one with a strange sleep routine.\n\nIn a video interview with Fortune released on Wednesday, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said he sleeps very little and splits his waking hours into two working days.\n\n\"I do try and get six, but I have unusual sleeping habits,\" he said, about his number of hours of sleep. \"I sort of manage during the day.\"\n\nHe said that any less sleep than that would be bad for the brain.\n\nHassabis cofounded DeepMind in 2010, which Google acquired in 2014. It merged with Google Brain in 2023 to form Google DeepMind, the lab behind tools such as Gemini and Nano Banana. The CEO and a DeepMind coworker, John Jumper, were awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for their work on protein structure prediction.\n\nHassabis said that he tries to pack his day in the office with as many meetings as possible with \"almost no time\" in between. He then gets home, spends time with family, and has dinner.\n\n\"Then I sort of start a second day of work about 10 p.m. and go to 4 a.m., where I do my thinking and kind of more creative work and research work,\" he said.\n\nThe CEO added that he's followed this schedule for about a decade. Hassabis earlier spoke about his sleep routine in a 2017 interview with BBC Radio.\n\n\"I can't imagine being creative at four in the morning. But, I come alive at about 1 a.m.,\" he told Fortune's Alyson Shontell.\n\nHassabis' routine matches what other tech founders have shared about their sleep schedules, especially during the early stages of founding or growing their businesses.\n\nElon Musk has said that he functions best with about six hours of sleep — any less affects his performance. In a 2018 interview with Bloomberg, Musk said that he slept on the floor of a Tesla factory during some production periods.\n\nMarc Benioff, meanwhile, said in a 2023 interview that he averages about eight hours of sleep.",

We will be making no further comment at this time.\"\n\nPostecoglou lasted just 39 days in the job after replacing Nuno Espirito Santo, who was sacked just three matches into the 2025-26 campaign.\n\nThey look set to become the first Premier League club to have four permanent managers in one season.\n\nDyche took over at the City Ground with Forest 18th in the table after one win in eight games during a difficult start to the season.\n\nAfter a 2-0 defeat by Bournemouth in his first match in charge, Dyche led Forest to four wins and one draw in their next seven to guide them out of the drop zone.\n\nA run of four consecutive defeats followed, but Dyche's side responded with a four-match unbeaten run - including a 2-1 win at fellow strugglers West Ham and a resilient goalless draw with leaders Arsenal.\n\nHowever, the improved form of Leeds United and West Ham has kept Forest mired in the relegation battle.\n\nForest finished 13th in the Europa League group table, with four wins, two draws and two defeats in their eight matches, to reach the knockout phase.\n\nThey face Turkish side Fenerbahce over two legs this month for the chance to reach the last 16, with the first leg taking place on Thursday, 19 February.\n\nForest are out of both domestic cup competitions, losing 3-2 to Swansea under Postecoglou in the EFL Cup third round in September and exiting the FA Cup on penalties to another Championship side, Wrexham, in the third round under Dyche last month.\n\nAfter being in contention for Champions League qualification for much of last season, Forest picked up just eight points from their final eight matches.\n\nThey finished seventh and qualified for the Conference League but were moved into the Europa League for 2025-26 at Crystal Palace's expense after the Eagles were deemed to be in breach of multi-club ownership rules.\n\nDuring that downturn in form, Nuno's relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis deteriorated and he was sacked in September.\n\nDyche was on the books of Forest as a youth-team player in the late 1980s when Brian Clough was manager, but never made a first-team appearance.\n\nHe was previously in charge of Everton before being sacked after just under two years in charge of the Toffees in January 2025.\n\nPrior to that Dyche spent nearly a decade as Burnley manager between October 2012 and April 2022, twice winning promotion to the top flight and helping the Clarets qualify for Europe for the first time since 1967.\n\nHe also had a stint in charge of Watford for the 2011–12 season, only to lose his job following a change of ownership.\n\nFollowing Forest's 0-0 draw with Wolves on Wednesday, Dyche sounded like a man who knew what was to follow.\n\nAfter an incredible 35 attempts on goal without scoring - more attempts than any team Dyche has managed in his 351 games in charge - the draw left them just three points clear of the drop zone.\n\nA frustrated Marinakis was pictured frequently during the City Ground draw with him appearing to be growing increasingly frustrated with every missed opportunity.\n\nPost match - and before his dismissal - Dyche said: \"The owner has been fair to me, without a shadow of a doubt. If anyone chooses to change in football now, that's their decision. We've all seen it.\n\n\"People can demand change, and then it's always whether they change or not.\n\n\"If the owner wants to make a change then that's up to him, and that's the way football is now, that's just the reality of it.\n\n\"I understand the noise here has changed significantly since the last few games.\"\n\nDyche undoubtedly arrived at Forest in difficult circumstances, but he appeared to steady the ship after a poor run of results under Postecoglou, winning seven of his first 12 games.\n\nIf results were taken from when Dyche took over, Forest would be mid-table, six points above third-from-bottom Tottenham.\n\nHe was even nominated for Premier League manager of the month a week ago, with two wins and one loss from their past six matches.\n\nSpeaking on Match of the Day, just an hour before Dyche's dismissal, ex-England striker Alan Shearer backed the former Burnley boss.\n\nHe said: \"I think with his know-how and his experience in the Premier League, I would without a doubt stick with Sean.\"\n\nFormer Tottenham midfielder Danny Murphy, added: \"I think for this battle at the bottom you wouldn't want a better manager than him.\n\n\"He's been there, done it, he stays calm. I think they'd be crazy to get rid of him.\n\n\"The other thing as well I suppose for Marinakis is if it wasn't for him they wouldn't be in the Premier League and they wouldn't be in Europe.\n\n\"So maybe he's got the right to do what he wants, but I don't think there's a manager you could bring in who is as capable as [Dyche] in this fight.\"\n\nNuno was sacked 23 days into the season.\n\nHis replacement Postecoglou lasted 39 days.\n\nDyche at least made it past the 100-day mark, but his reign ends after 114.\n\nNottingham Forest are now remarkably searching for a fourth manager of a season which has lurched from crisis to crisis.\n\nForest's problems are of their own making after Nuno fell out with global sporting director Edu and owner Marinakis to make his position untenable.\n\nPostecoglou was an ill-advised appointment, a clash of styles going from Nuno's counter-attack to the Australian's high-pressing, high-action game.\n\nDyche was supposed to be the safe pair of hands, reverting back to what the squad knew under Nuno, and his connection with the club - having come through the academy - initially made it a sweet homecoming.\n\nSeven wins from his first 12 stabilised the club and season to a point, with Forest mid-table in the league if results since Dyche was appointed in October were only taken into account.\n\nBut just two wins in their past 10 league games - plus an FA Cup exit to Wrexham last month - saw a rapid loss of faith from both the board and the fans.\n\nThe season is now an embarrassment for Forest. It was not supposed to be like this, with European football returning to the City Ground for the first time since 1995-96.\n\nBut after two failed appointments and the decision to sack Nuno after a breakdown in relationships Forest are in tatters.\n\nThey finished seventh last season and spent £180m but relegation is a very real possibility in a season where the club, especially Postecoglou, had targeted winning the Europa League.\n\nLatest Nottingham Forest news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Nottingham Forest - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "With many unable to access or afford qualified therapists, AI is filling the mental healthcare vacuum, amid calls for tighter regulation\n\nOn a quiet evening in her Abuja hotel, Joy Adeboye, 23, sits on her bed clutching her phone, her mind racing and chest tightening. On her screen is yet another abusive message from her stalker – a man she had met nine months earlier at her church.\n\nHe had asked Adeboye out; when she declined, he began sending her intimidating, insulting and blackmailing messages on social media, as well as spreading false information about her online. There were even death threats.\n\nThe experience is taking its toll on her mental health, leaving her struggling to cope. Family and friends she confided in did not take it seriously, and she cannot afford in-person therapy or counselling. As the feeling of panic rose at the sight of his words, she turns to an alternative: a WhatsApp chatbot called Chat Kemi.\n\n“Good evening, Resilient Joy,” the bot types. “How are you today?”\n\n Adeboye hesitates, then starts typing: “Someone is defaming me online and threatening to kill me, because I refused to date him. I am depressed and confused. What should I do?”\n\nThe chatbot, which Adeboye had heard about at an event on gender-based violence run by an NGO, advises her to deactivate her social media accounts and provide all necessary information about the person making the threats to someone she trusts.\n\nFor the first time in months, Adeboye says, she felt less alone.\n\nAI platforms offering first-line mental health support have proliferated over the past year, with early trials in the US showing mixed results. In Nigeria, where AI has been embraced in many sectors and industries, a growing number of people turn to chatbots for virtual therapy.\n\nNigeria’s health system, including its mental health provision, has long been underfunded. Between 2015 and 2025, Nigeria has consistently spent less than 5% of its budget to healthcare, with 4.2% allocated for 2026, far less than the 15% target that African Union member states agreed to as part of the 2001 Abuja Declaration. It is not known how many people in Nigeria live with mental health conditions but, with only 262 psychiatrists in a country of 240 million people, most do not get adequate treatment.\n\nThe shortages have been exacerbated by the Trump administration dismantling USAID, which has badly hit services in Nigeria, especially at the primary level, having a devastating effect on patients in communities already struggling with HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and other health challenges. More than 90% of Nigerians have no health insurance, and now face uncertainty over access to services and feelings of helplessness over rising costs.\n\nPrivate healthcare is expensive; one therapy session can cost between 50,000 naira (£27) – the equivalent of a week’s worth of groceries. Cultural stigma remains strong; many Nigerians still associate mental illness with spiritual weakness or witchcraft.\n\nCommercial and nonprofit AI initiatives are starting to fill this vacuum. HerSafeSpace is an organisation that offers free and instant legal and emotional assistance to victims of technology-facilitated gender-based violence in five west and central African countries. Its Chat Kemi service is available in local and international languages.\n\n“These services don’t replace therapy,” says its founder, Abideen Olasupo. Instead, the chatbot uses a referral system to direct users and specific cases to mental health, legal or psychosocial professionals or organisations, should the need arise.\n\n“Our major objective is to support young girls, who are particularly vulnerable to gender-based violence, especially online,” he says.\n\nOther platforms in Nigeria offering similar services include FriendnPal, whose AI chatbot provides emotional support, matches patients with licensed therapists and includes mood tracking, psycho-education and ASMR tools to alleviate stress and anxiety.\n\nIts pay-as-you-go model gives users instant access to tailored therapy sessions that can include homework or assessments, according to Esther Eruchie, who created the service in response to the loss of her mother after years of depression caused by her 20-year-old brother’s death.\n\nAnother platform, Blueroomcare, connects clients with licensed therapists through video, voice, text and in-app messaging. It offers in-person outpatient and virtual care at partner clinics nationwide, includes a free wellness assessment, and charges between 5,000 and 51,000 naira for a therapist subscription plan.\n\n“Therapy was often too expensive, and there weren’t enough professionals to meet the demand,” says Moses Aiyenuro, who founded Blueroomcare after his own struggles with depression. “I wanted to build a platform that lowers the barriers to care.”\n\nThe technology used by these apps follows scripts written by licensed Nigerian psychologists and therapists who deliver care to users.\n\nIn Lagos, Oluwakemi Oluwakayode, a mother of four, started using FriendnPal’s chatbot after watching her eight-year-old daughter endure frequent seizures due to cerebral palsy.\n\n“Sometimes, it gave very standard replies,” she admits. “But I could finally say things I couldn’t share with my family. That alone gave me relief.”\n\nLater, the app connected her with a licensed therapist – something she says she would never have considered without AI easing her into it.\n\nDr Joy Aifuobhokhan, a Lagos-based public health doctor, says these platforms’ advantage is that they are more affordable and efficient than conventional therapy. “Digital platforms save time otherwise spent preparing, commuting and waiting [to be seen] at physical consultation centres,” she says.\n\nBut some experts caution that AI cannot provide the same level of expertise as a qualified therapist. “These platforms borrow from clinical methods like CBT [cognitive behavioural therapy] and mindfulness,” says Dr Nihinlola Olowe, a psychologist at Live Still Counselling Services, a Nigerian-based mental health practice.\n\n“They can be useful for coping, but they cannot replace the depth or judgment of professional care.”\n\nEruchie says FriendnPal has run more than 10,000 sessions in the past year, while Olasupo says HerSafeSpace has 1,600 users across three continents. Blueroomcare declined to say how many users it had.\n\nBut measuring the impact based on numbers alone is a challenge. “The real story lies in the engagement,” says Olasupo. “It’s exciting to see that users aren’t just using the app and leaving – they’re coming back again and again.”\n\nFor many patients, the immediacy and anonymity of a chatbot is key to its appeal but the ease of digital care could come at the cost of privacy. Avril Eyewu-Edero, a cybersecurity expert, believes that without introducing strong database protections in Nigeria, sensitive information – such as medical histories – becomes vulnerable the moment it enters an AI system.\n\n“If startups fail to prioritise privacy and encryption from the outset, adoption will stall. Nigerians are eager but wary,” she says.\n\nFounders of the services acknowledge these uncertainties, often highlighting their use of end-to-end encryption, unique codes that identify users or devices without including personally identifiable information, and strict non-sharing policies – even with government authorities, unless compelled by a court order.\n\nNow, medical professionals are calling on the Nigerian government to develop enforceable national standards for AI. Dr Alero Roberts, a public health consultant and lecturer at the University of Lagos’s medical college, says: “AI chatbots for mental health are an innovative solution, but without robust regulation, we are venturing blindly into potentially dangerous territory.\n\n“Robots can’t interpret human emotion as humans do. For people in crisis, like suicidal thoughts or psychosis, human contact is crucial. Someone, even a non-professional, can recognise the need for urgent intervention,” she says. “This is often lost with AI; strong governance is essential.”\n\nUnlike medicines or hospitals, AI mental health platforms operate in a regulatory grey zone. Nigeria’s 2023 Data Protection Act sets baseline privacy standards but lacks specific AI regulations for healthcare.\n\n“The main issue is enforcement, not a lack of laws,” says Ayotunde Abiodun of SBM Intelligence, a thinktank that provides analysis on political, economic and social issues in Nigeria and across west Africa.\n\nBabatunde Bamigboye, head of regulations at the Nigeria Data Protection Commission, a statutory body set up under the 2023 law, says: “Any use involving personal data must comply with the act. The framework focuses on data ethics, testing within sandboxes, and risk mitigation. AI in Nigeria is governed, but not via AI-specific laws.”\n\nIn Lagos, Oluwakayode continues to use FriendnPal. One day, she hopes to afford in-person therapy, but for now, the bot is her companion.\n\n“I know it’s not a real human,” she says. “But at 2am, it feels like someone is there for me. And that’s enough to keep me going.”",

    "fullText": "Since returning to NASCAR in 2021 with Hendrick Motorsports (HMS), Kyle Larson has enjoyed immense success in the HendrickCars.com No. 5 Chevrolet. As a Hendrick driver, the 33-year-old has earned 26 Cup wins and two Cup Series championships in both 2021 and 2025.\n\nFollowing that incredible run, it should come as no surprise that Hendrick Motorsports announced a five-year contract extension for Larson. Crew chief Cliff Daniels has also signed a multi-year contract extension. Additionally, HendrickCars.com will continue as the No. 5's primary sponsor for 35 of 38 races during the Cup Series season in the coming years. The company noted over $80 million in television exposure and tens of millions of social media engagements, courtesy of Larson.\n\n“I’m incredibly grateful to continue my career with Hendrick Motorsports and HendrickCars.com,” said Larson in a release from the team. “This team, this organization and this family have given me everything I need to compete at the highest level. We’ve accomplished a lot together, but I truly believe the best is still ahead. I’m grateful to Mr. Hendrick and JB (Brown, president of Hendrick Automotive Group) for believing in me, and I’m excited to keep chasing wins and championships with Cliff and the 5 team for many more years.”\n\nHendrick Motorsports is the winningest team in NASCAR Cup Series history, and Larson is one of the team's most successful drivers. Only Hall of Famers Jimmie Johnson and Jeff Gordon have earned more wins and titles than Larson for HMS, and only Tim Richmond has a higher winning percentage in HMS equipment.\n\nHMS team owner and chairman and CEO of Hendrick Automotive Group, Rick Hendrick, said of the new deal: “When you look at what it takes to succeed at the highest level year after year, it starts with people. Kyle is one of the most complete drivers in our sport. His talent, work ethic and instincts give us a chance to win every time we race. Cliff is a true servant leader who brings out the best in everyone around him and sets the standard for how we go to the track.

    "fullText": "Wednesday was a busy day for U.S athletes at the Milan Cortina Olympics as Team USA doubled its gold-medal tally.\n\nMeanwhile, injured snowboarder Chloe Kim laid to rest any notion that she's anything but the gold-medal favorite. Madison Chock and Evan Bates likely finished their careers on the podium. And the jilted lover of the unfaithful Norwegian biathlete has responded.\n\nHere are five of the top stories from Day 5 of the Milan Cortina Olympics\n\nIf you didn't know Jordan Stolz's name before, he introduced himself to the wider world on Wednesday.\n\nThe 21-year-old U.S. speedskater who's the best in the sport made his Olympics debut in dramatic fashion. Stolz trailed Jenning de Boo of the Netherlands in the final lap of their 1,000-meter race and appeared at risk of an upset loss.\n\nBut he chased de Boo down on the back stretch, then sprinted past him on the final turn as if propelled out of a slingshot to overtake the Dutch skater with the fastest time of the day at 106.28, a new Olympic record. Stolz made up a deficit of nearly a full second on the final lap to secure the win.\n\nA NEW SPEED SKATING STANDARD. 💪\n\nJordan Stolz wins GOLD with a men's 1000m #WinterOlympics RECORD. pic.twitter.com/qW3DSj2vP0\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 11, 2026\n\nStolz's time survived the final race of the competition, and the world-record holder in the 1,000 meters is now the Olympic record holder and a gold medalist. De Boo took silver, and China's Ning Zhongyan won bronze.\n\nStolz is just getting started at Milan Cortina. He has a realistic shot at leaving the Games with four gold medals. He's also slated to compete at 500 meters (Saturday), 1,500 meters (Feb. 19) and in the mass start event slated to close speedskating competition on Feb. 21.\n\nIt's not the color they were targeting. But Madison Chock and Evan Bates finally have Olympic medals of their own.\n\nThe veteran U.S. ice dancers skated second to last in Wednesday's free dance and executed a performance worthy of gold-medal contention.\n\nSimply BEAUTIFUL. This is what 15 years of skating together looks like. 😍 pic.twitter.com/UQhpVEBB90\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 11, 2026\n\nBut France’s Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron entered Wednesday with a slim lead of 0.46 points after edging the U.S. couple in Monday's rhythm dance.\n\nAnd they delivered a brilliant performance of their own to edge Chock and Bates with a total score of 225.82 to secure the gold medal.\n\nLaurence Fournier Beaudry ganó la medalla de oro en danza sobre hielo en los Juegos Olímpicos de Invierno de Milán-Cortina 2026, junto a su pareja Guillaume Cizeron. 🥇⛸️#PatinajeArtistico pic.twitter.com/XFut3HGhrI\n\n— Bastian C (@basdc68) February 11, 2026\n\nChock and Bates won silver with a combined score of 224.39, 1.43 points behind the gold-medal winners. Canada's Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier won bronze with a score of 217.74.\n\nThe individual Olympic medal was the final item on the résumé for Chock and Bates, who have been partners on the ice for 15 years and married since 2024. They've won two Olympic gold medals in team competition, including from Sunday night. And they entered the Milan Cortina Games with three consecutive world championships.\n\nWednesday's performance was expected to be their last in competition. If so, they'll conclude their decorated careers with two more Olympic medals from Milan Cortina.\n\nChloe Kim declared on Jan. 13 that she was \"good to go\" for the Olympics despite sustaining a torn left labrum in training just days earlier.\n\nIt turns out that she was right. The two-time U.S. Olympic gold medalist in the halfpipe made her Milan Cortina debut in qualifying on Wednesday. As stated, she's good to go.\n\nKim laid down a monster score of 90.25 on her first of two runs.\n\nTwo-time Gold medalist Chloe Kim WOWS with a huge first run in halfpipe qualifying. 😮‍💨🇺🇸\n\n📺 Peacock | #WinterOlympics pic.twitter.com/x9sIIICdEg\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 11, 2026\n\nThat score stood at the end of the day as the best by nearly three points. Japan's Sara Shimizu finished second with an 87.5, and Kim's U.S. teammate Maddie Mastro finished third with an 86.\n\nThe scores don't carry over to Thursday's final, where each rider will have three runs to lay down the best score of the day. But Kim erased any doubt that her injury has made her anything but the favorite to secure her third consecutive Olympic gold medal and the sixth in seven Games in the event for the U.S.\n\nIt was a banner day for the U.S. in women's moguls competition. All four American competitors advanced to Wednesday's final. Two of them finished on the podium with gold and silver medals.\n\nLiz Lemley finished with gold thanks to a dominant performance that secured a score of 83.20, well clear of any of the skiers before her.\n\nLiz Lemley is as GOOD AS GOLD in her #WinterOlympics debut. 💪 pic.twitter.com/vTKIwtAsfW\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 11, 2026\n\nHer teammate Jaelin Kauf competed after her and posted an 80.77 as the only other competitor to crack 80 points.\n\nJaelin Kauf secures BACK-TO-BACK SILVER in women's moguls at the #WinterOlympics! 🥈 pic.twitter.com/hCMFfHPbZ6\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 11, 2026\n\nNeither of their positions were secure until reigning Australian Olympic gold medalist Jakara Anthony competed. But Anthony fell on her final run and finished in eighth place, ensuring that Lemley and Kauf would claim gold and silver.\n\nFrance's Perrine Laffont won bronze with a score of 78. Japan's Hinako Tomitaka matched Laffont's 78, but finished excruciatingly off the podium in fourth place due to a tiebreaker.\n\nIt was clear from reports that Lindsey Vonn's broken leg was no simple fracture.\n\nVonn provided some insight on Wednesday hammering that point home. In her second update since her devastating injury crash in Sunday's alpine downhill competition, Vonn posted on Instagram that she'd undergone a third surgery to repair her fractured left tibia. She also shared a picture from her hospital bed demonstrating just how serious her injury is.\n\nVonn's left leg is placed in what appears to be an external fixator, a brace that uses pins, wires and bars to stabilize severely fractured bones. She previously announced that she'd sustained a complex fracture, which Yale medicine defines as \"when the bone breaks into bits and pieces, when the soft tissue surrounding the bone is severely damaged, or when the patient has other illnesses or injuries that complicate treatment and healing.\"\n\nIt's not clear if Vonn will require more procedures to rebuild her broken leg. But she clearly has a difficult road to recovery.\n\nVonn expressed optimism in her recovery while giving a thumbs up alongside a note of gratitude to her medical team and supporters and well wishes for Team USA at the Olympics.\n\n\"I had my 3rd surgery today and it was successful,\" Vonn wrote. \"Success today has a completely different meaning than it did a few days ago. I’m making progress and while it is slow, I know I’ll be ok.\"\n\nNBC's drone pilots are doing outstanding work getting third-person shots of athletes barreling down the halfpipe, racing on the downhill course and sledding through the twists and turns of the luge track. They also appear to be having a good time.\n\nOn Wednesday, they offered up this gem simulating a first-person view of what it might look like to take on the Milan Cortina moguls course.\n\nWait for it...😍 pic.twitter.com/gDPuXK4O2V\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 11, 2026\n\nWe have an update on the saga of the cheating Norwegian biathlete. He cheated in love, not in competition, to be clear.\n\nIn case you missed it, Sturla Holm Lægreid won bronze in the 20km biathlon on Tuesday, then made the questionable decision to admit — in tears — in his post-race interview that he cheated on his girlfriend and that he'd hoped to win her back.\n\nThe girlfriend has now weighed in. Make that the ex-girlfriend. She understandably does not sound interested in Lægreid's post-infidelity overtures.\n\nThe girlfriend — who chose to remain anonymous — provided this response to Norwegian tabloid VG:\n\n“It’s hard to forgive,\" she wrote. \"Even after a declaration of love in front of the whole world. ... I did not choose to be put in this position, and it hurts to have to be in it. We have had contact, and he is aware of my opinions on this.”\n\nHere's the initial interview that sparked one of the strangest story of these Games:\n\nSå ikke helt denne komme. Tidenes mest absurde medaljeintervju. 🫣 pic.twitter.com/fFwJ1B0vCO\n\n— Daniel Vassbund (@Smoothedan) February 10, 2026\n\n\"There's someone I wanted to share it with who might not be watching,\" he said, via BBC translation, fighting back tears.\"Six months ago I met the love of my life — the most beautiful and kindest person in the world. Three months ago I made my biggest mistake and cheated on her.\n\n\"I had the gold medal in life, and I am sure there are many people who will see things differently, but I only have eyes for her.\"\n\nIt sounds like her eyes are looking elsewhere.",

    "fullText": "The Minnesota Vikings traded defensive tackle Harrison Phillips to the New York Jets last summer, a shocking transaction because fans believed the team held Phillips in the highest regard. And when Phillips arrived in New York, he quickly realized the grass wasn’t greener on the other side.\n\nPhillips’ comments put the Vikings’ former captain back in the spotlight and raise questions about the Jets’ tone.\n\nThe veteran lineman told all this week, sparing his head coach, Aaron Glenn, from criticism but noting a markedly different atmosphere from his time in Minnesota and Buffalo.\n\nIt’s a story of the Jets being “the Jets.”\n\nPhillips spoke to Roundtable Sports on Radio Row last week, and he wasn’t shy about revealing the truth.\n\nHe said about his employer, “I think Aaron Glenn inherited a very cancerous, truculent group — whole, top to bottom. It’s not individual people’s fault. I was there for one season — it was a very difficult season — and I almost wanted to waver on some of my thoughts and my beliefs and my optimism.”\n\n“So, I can’t imagine being there for year after year after year after year and not seeing the results that you wanted, and it tainted people. Because my coach is going to get fired, my teammate’s going to get fired, I’m going to be a free agent, I might get fired, I have to play for me, I have to make sure my tape is hot regardless of what the system is asking me to do, what the scheme is telling me to do.”\n\nMany Jets fans saw the interview and thought, “Sounds about right.”\n\nPhillips added, “Then, young players come in and see, ‘Oh, that’s my vet, that’s how they’re acting, so that’s the way I’m going to act, too.’ It’s a long chain of things, and it can’t be fixed like that.”\n\n“I think AG’s mindset, of any coach I’ve been around, to deal with what we had to deal with this season and be as consistent as he was to us throughout that whole thing, was super cool to see,”\n\nUnless he’s released, Phillips can’t quite get out of New York; he’s scheduled to be a free agent in 2027.\n\nOn August 20th, ESPN’s Adam Schefter tweeted: “ESPN sources: Vikings are trading DT Harrison Phillips and a 2027 7th-round pick to the New York Jets in exchange for a 2026 6th-round pick and a 2027 6th-round pick, pending Phillips’ physical. Phillips now joins Jowon Briggs as the second DT that the Jets traded for Wednesday.”\n\nFans checked to ensure the tweet wasn’t from a parody account because — why would Minnesota trade Phillips?\n\nThe defense wound up ranking third in the NFL in EPA per play, so losing Phillips wasn’t a death sentence, but there were times throughout the 2025 campaign when Phillips’s run defense would’ve come in handy. Now, for their troubles, the Vikings will get a pair of extra 6th-Round picks, which, for all intents and purposes, nobody really cares about.\n\nIn the Twin Cities, Phillips earned respect as a team captain and tone-setter. He justified his contract by providing stability at defensive tackle when the Vikings struggled with inconsistency at the position. He steadied the middle of the defensive line when it sometimes faltered.\n\nOff the field, he became the organization’s most visible humanitarian, consistently investing time and resources into community work. Over 51 games in Minnesota, the 29-year-old recorded 207 tackles, 17 quarterback hits, and 6.5 sacks, also serving as a cultural pillar in the locker room.\n\nPhillips personally played well in New York last season — go figure — but his team stunk. Utterly stunk. The Jets started 0-7, basically eliminating themselves from postseason contention by Halloween, and finished the campaign with a horrid 3-14 record.\n\nIn recent weeks, Glenn has fired almost all of his coaching staff, so whatever culture he hoped to fix per the cancerous Phillips observation will start from scratch in 2026.\n\nPhillips banked a 72.5 grade from Pro Football Focus. He did his part. It’s also worth noting that Phillips, until 2025, spent his entire career with the Bills and Vikings. Playing for a bottom-feeder was new territory — that he evidently didn’t enjoy.\n\nWhat’s Next for Phillips & the Jets?\n\nPhillips can escape from New York next offseason, and he’ll be 31 when it’s time to sign his next contract. Unless the Jets trade him in the upcoming months, he’s stuck contractually.\n\nFor the Jets’ overall outlook, well, they’re in a familiar spot. They need a quarterback. Justin Fields and Tyrod Taylor held down the fort in 2025, but all that led to was a 3-14 record. In the coming weeks and months, New York can pursue a passer via trade like Mac Jones or Kyler Murray, sign Malik Willis from free agency, or explore the draft for a signal-caller like Ty Simpson, Carson Beck, or Trinidad Chambliss.\n\nNew York has the third-lowest Super Bowl odds for next year, with a +20000 moneyline, only besting the Miami Dolphins and Arizona Cardinals.",

The team fired head coach Raheem Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot, later naming Kevin Stefanski and Ian Cunningham as replacements.\n\nThe Falcons hired two new coordinators while retaining defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich on staff. Tommy Rees has taken over for Zac Robinson as offensive coordinator, and Craig Aukerman replaced Marquice Williams as special teams coordinator.\n\nRees and Aukerman were introduced during a press conference on Wednesday afternoon. Aukerman, who previously served as the special teams coordinator for the Miami Dolpins, provided some insight into his coaching philosophy.\n\n\"Basically, my whole thing is we wanna teach these guys whatever we can to help our team win,\" Aukerman explained. \"Whether it's on offense, defense, or special teams. If you're a four-core football player, a two-core football player, it doesn't matter. We wanna have a role for you and we want you to excel in it. So that's my biggest thing: I wanna teach these guys. I wanna develop them and I want to inspire them to play as hard as they possibly can.\"\n\nAukerman spent five years as a special teams coach with the Tennessee Titans and was promoted to assistant head coach in 2023.\n\nThe Falcons are also expected to add former Los Angeles Rams special teams coordinator Chase Blackburn as an assistant, according to a report from NFL Network's Tom Pelissero.\n\nThe Falcons are hiring Chase Blackburn as their assistant special teams coach, per source. pic.twitter.com/3BLO8OpOXi\n\n— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) February 11, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on Falcons Wire: Atlanta Falcons: Craig Aukerman on coaching philosophy",

    "description": "These prospects should've made the cut.",
    "fullText": "Top snubs from the 2026 NFL Scouting Combine originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAs we close the book on the 2025 season, the 2026 NFL Scouting Combine will give us our first taste of football for the offseason. The football world will descend upon Indianapolis for a week of interviews, drills, and athletic testing destined to shape the late-winter discourse.\n\nOver 300 prospects will be invited to the event, hoping to boost their draft stocks ahead of the pro day circuit. Mississippi quarterback Trinidad Chambliss won't be among them.\n\nFear not, Chambliss was not left off the list for character concerns or bureaucratic oversight. Rather, it's an indictment of the NFL's expectations for his pending hearing, which is challenging the NCAA's decision to deny his waiver for eligibility. It seems like Chambliss is headed back to school, allowing us to focus on the prospects who were snubbed from the Scouting Combine.\n\nBlack, after six college seasons, will play the majority of his rookie season at 25 years old. That developmental path (and his age-adjusted production) isn't kind to his draft stock, and it may be the biggest reason he isn't headed to Indianapolis.\n\nHowever, Black put himself on NFL radars in 2025, playing a significant role on a championship-winning offense. Black ran for 1,040 yards and 10 scores this past season. He boasts NFL-level athleticism with the speed to hit home runs, experience with zone and gap runs, and enough size to check the box.\n\nIn a world where Vanderbilt's Diego Pavia and Georgia Tech's Haynes King are getting Combine invites, it becomes difficult to gather why Kaliakmanis won't be among the participants in Indianapolis.\n\nKaliakmanis was incredibly productive for Rutgers, ranking eighth in EPA and seventh in EPA/DB -- between Pavia and King -- in 2025. He's not a lock to get drafted, but Kaliakmanis looks the part of a mid-Day 3 pick and a prototypical backup quarterback at the next level. With a big arm and multiple seasons of starting experience, it's surprising that he hasn't gotten more love.\n\nTyren Montgomery, WR, John Carroll\n\nPerhaps the most notable admission from the Combine festivities is John Carroll's Tyren Montgomery. His wild ride to Mobile culminated in a strong Senior Bowl performance, proving that a Division III standout could play with the best upperclassmen the Division I could offer.\n\nAn excellent athlete at 6'1\", 190 pounds, Carroll seems like a prospect the NFL would want to see get as many reps as possible during the pre-draft process. Given that nearly 50 receivers were invited to the event, Montgomery should have received an invitation.\n\nFoster stood out on my preseason board as a potential low-end starter headlining the Kansas offensive line. All he's done in the time since is continue to win in pass protection.\n\nFoster has SEC pedigree after three seasons in the middle of Texas A&M's line, then he took a step forward against Big 12 competition. With adequate measurables and a track record of success, his median projection still looks like a solid backup center.\n\nTerion Stewart, RB, Virginia Tech\n\nStewart won't be in Indianapolis because of his production. Just 469 yards in his first year of Power 4 play isn't all that impressive, and nine career receptions is laughably little work through the air.\n\nMORE: Meet the three contenders for RB2 in the 2026 NFL Draft\n\nHowever, Stewart has intriguing fundamentals, fun burst, and elite contact balance, perhaps making him a role player at the next level. It will be an uphill climb to raise his stock during the pre-draft process, but his film made a worthy case for Indianapolis.

Still, Haynes has the athleticism, footwork, and instincts to make plays on Sundays.\n\nHaynes is a former receiver who stands out as a natural pass-catcher out of the backfield.

    "fullText": "If Not Malik Willis, Who? Browns need to eye this veteran QB originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAndrew Berry didn’t slam the door on adding an outside quarterback this offseason, but if the Browns do go shopping, it shouldn’t be for Malik Willis.\n\nWillis is expected to command somewhere in the $30–40 million range, and that simply doesn’t line up with Cleveland’s salary cap reality. Deshaun Watson’s contract still looms large on the books, and tying up more major money in a quarterback who has barely played just doesn’t add up. That should be a non-starter for Berry.\n\nThe national media hype linking Willis to Cleveland is unfounded said longtime Browns analyst Tony Grossi on ESPN radio, and is a \"lazy\" take because of the team's uncertainty at the position. One example is this X post quoting NFL insider Jason La Canfora:\n\nPer @JasonLaCanfora Both the #Browns and #Dolphins are two of the most interested teams in QB Malik Willis in free agency\n\nThe speculation could be a deal similar to Justin Fields 2-years, 40 Million (30 Guaranteed)\n\nThis report indicates that Willis made a strong impression on…\n\n— Bob Pompeani (@KDPomp) February 10, 2026\n\nMore: Browns warning: Don’t fall for the $40M Malik Willis hype and salary cap trap\n\nWillis started one game this past season (a Packers loss) and has yet to show he can carry an offense over a long stretch. Investing that much cash in a dart throw QB with all the cap restraints already in place is a pipe dream at best.\n\nIf the Browns add a quarterback, the move should be about stability, not splash.\n\nTyler “Snoop” Huntley makes far more sense. He’s a reliable veteran backup who’s handled meaningful snaps, kept teams afloat, and understands what it means to step in without derailing a locker room.\n\nHe’s also been through Browns training camp before, and new head coach Todd Monken knows him well from their time in Baltimore. Maybe most appealing is that he won’t break the bank.\n\nThe priority in 2026 should be simple. Find out what you truly have in Shedeur Sanders by giving him a proper training camp and taking reps with the starters. A secondary goal should be seeing whether Deshaun Watson has anything left to contribute coming off of two Achilles surgeries.\n\nA steady backup like Huntley supports that plan. A pricey gamble on Willis only muddies it.\n\nDo the Browns have to draft offense in round 1?

    "fullText": "Title hopefuls Inter recorded a seventh consecutive Serie A victory in their latest outing against Fiorentina. Meanwhile, Lazio prevailed in a seven-goal thriller against relegation-threatened Genoa.\n\nHere’s how the latest round of results unfolded in Italy’s top flight as Inter try to keep the pressure on league leaders Roma.\n\nInter continued their impressive run of form with a dominant display against Fiorentina. Lina Magull found the breakthrough in the closing stages of the first half, steering her precise header out of Cecilie Fiskerstrand’s reach. Forward Haley Bugeja added a second just after the hour mark, outmuscling her marker to latch onto a through ball and slide a composed shot into the bottom corner.\n\nThere was still plenty of time left in the contest for Elisa Polli to net her third Serie A goal of the season, and for Tessa Wullaert to fire wide from the penalty spot. While Wullaert would have been disappointed with the miss, Inter will be delighted with a third consecutive victory without conceding.\n\nLazio came from behind to establish a 3-1 lead in their thrilling away clash against Genoa. Emma Martín struck just before the 20-minute mark to cancel out Arianna Acuti’s opener. Clarisse Le Bihan and Martina Piemonte each grabbed a goal apiece to establish a two-goal cushion. However, Anastasia Ferrara quickly reduced the deficit with her first Serie A goal.\n\nUnfortunately for the hosts, their hopes of a positive result were dashed in the second period. Eleonora Goldoni volleyed home with the aid of a deflection, before Piemonte towered high to glance her header in from Elisabetta Oliviero’s inswinging cross. Piemonte’s second wrapped up an impressive win that has left Lazio in fifth and four points adrift of the top three. As for Genoa, they are hovering above the dotted line following a seventh defeat in eight Serie A matches.\n\nRoma were made to work for all three points in Sunday’s home meeting with AC Milan. The hosts were left frustrated after Evelyne Viens saw two goals ruled out for offside. However, Roma were handed a numerical advantage when Kayleigh van Doorsen was dismissed for a dangerous challenge on Rinsola Babajide. The leaders quickly made full use of that red card, grabbing the all important winner through Valentina Bergamaschi. The 29-year-old steered the ball home after meeting Babajide’s knockdown from a deep cross.\n\nElsewhere, Juventus saw off Como via a 2-0 scoreline to record a fifth consecutive victory in all competitions. Como created a number of chances, but they ultimately lacked Juventus’ quality in the final third. Estela Carbonell broke the deadlock in the 41st minute, sending her effort looping over Astrid Gilardi with the aid of a deflection. Paulina Krumbiegel made sure of the three points in the closing stages, powering a header home from Lindsey Thomas’s cross.\n\nNapoli made it three consecutive wins in a row with a commanding 3-1 success against Ternana. Francesca Quazzico’s own goal presented Napoli with a sixth-minute lead. The defender’s miserable first half was completed when she was sent off for a needless studs-up tackle. Alessia Carcassi added a second within four minutes of the restart, shortly before Katja Schroffenegger dropped the ball over the line in her attempt to deal with a corner. The only disappointment for Napoli was that they were denied a clean sheet by Giada Pellegrino’s fourth league goal of the season. The win keeps Napoli within three points of third-placed Juventus, while Ternana remain bottom of the table on goal difference.\n\nSassuolo’s home game with Parma looked set to end goalless until Davina Philtjens produced a stunning strike to win the game in the 81st minute. The-36-year-old let the ball run across her on the edge of the box before firing a left-footed strike out of Camelia Ceasar’s reach. The 1-0 success ended a run of three consecutive defeats, moving Sassuolo five points clear of the relegation zone. As for Parma, they are just two points above Ternana.\n\nPiemonte is the outright leader in the Serie A scoring charts with 10 goals in 13 appearances. The Lazio striker has also scored over 50% of Lazio’s league goals this season.\n\nPhiltjens undoubtedly scored the best goal of the recent round of Serie A action. The long-serving Sassuolo player unleashed an unstoppable strike from the edge of the box – an effort worthy of snatching all three points.\n\nDaniëlle de Jong: Juventus energy at ‘top level’ ahead of UWCL play-off against Wolfsburg\n\nSerie A match-day 12 round-up: Parma denied famous Roma win as Inter title hopes boosted\n\nWSL: No alcohol-related incidents as Fan Choice receives ‘overwhelmingly positive’ feedback",

    "fullText": "The James Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame is a step closer to adding to its esteemed roster of myriad basketball legends.\n\nOn Wednesday, three-time WNBA champion Candace Parker, Team USA’s 1996 women’s national team, Elena Delle Donne and Chamique Holdsclaw were among the premier names announced as finalists for the hoops hall, which will soon welcome many of the biggest names in the history of women’s basketball. Former NBA All-Stars Blake Griffin and Amar’e Stoudemire will also be finalists, with Milwaukee Bucks coach Doc Rivers also closer to the Hall.\n\nParker, a two-time WNBA MVP, will forever remain a pre-eminent part of influencing women’s hoops. In 2008, after an esteemed career at the University of Tennessee, she immediately broke through in the pros by becoming the first (and only) player in league history to win MVP and Rookie of the Year honors. Hall of Famers Wilt Chamberlain and Wes Unseld are the only NBA players to do so. Parker, whose 16-year career ended in 2023, is ranked 10th in WNBA history in total points, third in rebounds, 11th in assists, fifth in blocks and 18th in career steals. She was named WNBA Finals MVP in 2016 after leading the Los Angeles Sparks to their fourth title in team history. In 2021, she led her hometown Chicago Sky to the franchise’s only WNBA championship.\n\nNicknamed the Women’s Dream Team, the 1996 Team USA women’s national squad remains one of the most dominant in the game’s history. It was led by several prominent names who are already individually enshrined in the Naismith Hall of Fame: Dawn Staley, Lisa Leslie, Rebecca Lobo, Sheryl Swoopes, Teresa Edwards and Katrina McClain. The roster also included Jennifer Azzi, Ruthie Bolton, Venus Lacy, Nikki McCray, Carla McGhee and Katy Steding. Credited with aiding the launch of the WNBA, this team defeated opponents by an average of 28.6 points per game en route to gold medal honors.\n\nDelle Donne, whose 10-year career ended in 2023, is the only player in WNBA history to win MVP honors with multiple franchises (2019 with Washington Mystics, 2015 with Chicago Sky). She steps closer to the hall thanks to her unique combination of shooting touch and basketball IQ, becoming the first player in WNBA history to join the prestigious 50-40-90 club (shooting at least 50 percent overall, 40 percent on 3-pointers and 90 percent on free throws for a full season). Her career scoring average of 19.5 points per game ranks fifth highest in WNBA history.\n\nHoldsclaw won WNBA Rookie of the Year honors in 1999 after averaging 16.9 points and 7.9 rebounds in her first season as a pro. She finished in the top 10 of MVP voting six times over her 11 WNBA seasons, during which she averaged 16.9 points and 7.6 rebounds. She peaked in 2003, averaging 20.5 points and 10.9 rebounds for the Washington Mystics. She finished her career with three All-WNBA selections and six All-Star nods and notched the 2002 league scoring title while leading the league in rebounds twice. But those accomplishments weren’t a surprise given her elite collegiate career at Tennessee, where she won Naismith Player of the Year honors twice (1998-99) and led the Lady Volunteers to three titles.\n\nFor the men’s side of this year’s finalist bracket, Rivers is one of seven coaches in NBA history to win Coach of the Year honors in their first season with a team, doing so with the Orlando Magic in 1999-00. His 1,183 regular-season wins rank sixth in NBA history. In 2008, he led the greatest single-season turnaround in NBA history as the Boston Celtics snapped a championship drought of over 20 years. In 2022, the NBA named Rivers as one of the 15 greatest coaches in league history.\n\nGriffin, who retired after the 2022-23 season, spent years as one of the most talented and athletic players in the NBA. He averaged 21.4 points and 9.0 rebounds over 765 career games, including a special run as the face of Lob City during arguably the most successful era in the LA Clippers’ history. For the 2013-14 season, he finished third in MVP voting after averaging 24.3 points (second-highest scoring average of his career), 9.5 rebounds and 3.9 assists. His seven triple-doubles are tied for second most in Clippers history.\n\nLike Griffin’s, Stoudemire’s athletic prowess and unmatched skill on offense made for a unique mix over a special career. He was pivotal to the Phoenix Suns’ revival led by two-time MVP Steve Nash and then-coach Mike D’Antoni, who joins Stoudemire as a finalist for the Hall. Stoudemire notched six All-Star selections and five All-NBA nods over his 14-year career in the NBA. At his peak, the 2002-03 Rookie of the Year averaged over 25 points per game and was one of the league’s most potent dunkers. He finished his career with averages of 18.9 points and 7.8 rebounds in 846 career games.\n\nD’Antoni’s 253 regular-season wins with Phoenix rank third in franchise history. His run as coach of the Seven Seconds or Less Suns included two runs to the Western Conference finals. During D’Antoni’s four full seasons as coach (2004-05 to 2007-08), Phoenix ranked third in the NBA in win percentage (.707) and total victories (232).\n\nThere are 21 total finalists this year. Others include Marques Johnson, Mark Few, Jerry Welsh, Dick Motta, Gary McKnight, Kelvin Sampson, Molly Bolin-Kazmer, Tal Brody, Joey Crawford and Kevin Johnson. The inductees will be announced in April. Enshrinement weekend is scheduled for later this year at Mohegan Sun Arena, beginning with a tip-off celebration and awards gala Aug. 14. The commencement ceremony will take place the next day at the Symphony Hall in Springfield, Mass.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter a disastrous 2025 season, most know where the Kansas City Chiefs' free agency shopping needs to start.\n\nKareem Hunt and Isiah Pacheco are free agents, and it's unclear whether either will return in 2026; even if one does, the Chiefs need a significant upgrade.\n\nBut who? The franchise tried to trade for Breece Hall before the trade deadline, but that fell through. Now, though, there's a host of options for Breet Veach to look at.\n\nAnd ESPN's Eric Moody is tipping the Chiefs will raid fellow AFC contender, the Jacksonville Jaguars, for star back Travis Etienne.\n\n\"Running back Travis Etienne Jr. will sign with the Chiefs during free agency,\" Moody wrote. \"Etienne would be intriguing as a proven, versatile back who has surpassed 1,000 rushing yards in three of his four healthy seasons, including 1,107 yards and seven touchdowns in 2025.\n\n\"His ability to contribute as both a runner and receiver (5,136 career all-purpose yards with 32 touchdowns) would boost a Chiefs backfield that averaged less 4.0 yards per carry last season and failed to produce a running back with at least 200 receiving yards.\"\n\nMore:Ravens' Lamar Jackson tipped to join illustrious Hall of Fame group in 2026\n\nTravis has all of the attributes that neither Hunt nor Pacheco has.\n\nThe pace, speed, burst, and home run ability. Not to mention his effectiveness as a receiver, either, which will add another element to Kansas City's passing game with Patrick Mahomes back.\n\nKansas City needs someone to take the offensive load off of Patrick's shoulders, and one way to do it is with a run game, and Etienne as the lead back could give the Chiefs their fear factor back.\n\nOf course, money will be key here, but if the Chiefs are serious about turning this ship around in 2026, money will be no object, and if Etienne is available, they'll go get him.\n\nAre Chiefs disrespected in latest power rankings?\n\nThree-time Pro Bowler makes plea for Lions stay to 59 TD star\n\nChargers' hire named one of the best upgrades of the offseason\n\nBears named big winners of 2025 draft class\n\nFormer Steelers player goes scorched earth on Ben Roethlisberger\n\nBills know how to fix Keon Coleman claims ESPN analyst\n\nCommanders get outlandish 2026 prediction from ESPN",

    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest have sacked Sean Dyche as head coach after less than four months in charge and are looking for their fourth boss of the season.\n\nForest were held to a goalless draw at home by bottom club Wolves on Wednesday and are just three points above the Premier League relegation zone with 12 games remaining.\n\nDyche, 54, succeeded Ange Postecoglou in October and had signed a contract until the summer of 2027.\n\n\"Nottingham Forest Football Club can confirm that Sean Dyche has been relieved of his duties as head coach,\" a statement read.\n\n\"We would like to thank Sean and his staff for their efforts during their time at the club and we wish them the best of luck for the future. We will be making no further comment at this time.\"\n\nPostecoglou lasted just 39 days in the job after replacing Nuno Espirito Santo, who was sacked just three matches into the 2025-26 campaign.\n\nDyche took over at the City Ground with Forest 18th in the table after one win in eight games during a difficult start to the season.\n\nAfter a 2-0 defeat by Bournemouth in his first match in charge, Dyche led Forest to four wins and one draw in their next seven to guide them out of the drop zone.\n\nA run of four consecutive defeats followed, but Dyche's side responded with a four-match unbeaten run - including a 2-1 win at fellow strugglers West Ham and a resilient goalless draw with leaders Arsenal.\n\nHowever, the improved form of Leeds United and West Ham has kept Forest mired in the relegation battle.\n\nForest finished 13th in the Europa League group table, with four wins, two draws and two defeats in their eight matches, to reach the knockout phase.\n\nThey face Turkish side Fenerbahce over two legs this month for the chance to reach the last 16, with the first leg taking place next Thursday.\n\nForest are out of both domestic cup competitions, losing 3-2 to Swansea under Postecoglou in the EFL Cup third round in September and exiting the FA Cup on penalties to another Championship side, Wrexham, in the third round under Dyche last month.\n\nAfter being in contention for Champions League qualification for much of last season, Forest picked up just eight points from their final eight matches.\n\nThey finished seventh and qualified for the Conference League but were moved into the Europa League for 2025-26 at Crystal Palace's expense after the Eagles were deemed to be in breach of multi-club ownership rules.\n\nDuring that downturn in form, Nuno's relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis deteriorated and he was sacked in September.\n\nDyche was on the books of Forest as a youth-team player in the late 1980s when Brian Clough was manager, but never made a first-team appearance.\n\nHe was previously in charge of Everton before being sacked after just under two years in charge of the Toffees in January 2025.\n\nPrior to that Dyche spent nearly a decade as Burnley manager between October 2012 and April 2022, twice winning promotion to the top flight and helping the Clarets qualify for Europe for the first time since 1967.\n\nHe also had a stint in charge of Watford for the 2011–12 season, only to lose his job following a change of ownership.\n\nLatest Nottingham Forest news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Nottingham Forest - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "A 2013 BBM Shohei Ohtani autograph card sold for $430,050 this weekend, setting a record for the most expensive card of the superstar before he came to MLB.\n\nThe card, which depicts Ohtani playing with NPB’s Nippon Ham Fighters, received a Gem Mint 10 grade from PSA — the highest grade possible. Ohtani has had plenty of other cards fetch an absurd amount on the open market this offseason, with a Topps 1-of-1 card selling for $3 million in Dec. 2025.\n\nHaving grown up in Japan, Ohtani played in NPB from 2013-17.\n\nHe took the league by storm as a unique, two-way player in his rookie season, though his numbers weren’t quite what fans would expect to see today.\n\nOhtani had a .643 OPs in 2013, and also struggled on the mound with a 4.02 ERA.\n\nHe continued to improve, though, and saw his numbers drastically increase the following year. In 2014, he had a .842 OPS and posted a 2.61 ERA through 155.1 innings pitched. Ohtani only got better from there, and had become an elite player by his final year in NPB.\n\nIn the 2017 season, the two-way star hit 22 home runs and tallied 67 RBIs, maintaining a 1.004 OPS throughout the season. On the mound, he had a 1.86 ERA through 140 innings and struck out 174 batters.\n\nThe star has blossomed into the best player in the world since joining MLB, so it’s no wonder his memorabilia is fetching such a high price. He’ll look to continue to grow in 2026, as the Dodgers chase the franchise’s first three-peat.\n\nThe post Japanese Shohei Ohtani Baseball Card Sells for Record Price appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "description": "Incheon United embark on their first season back in K League 1 following promotion from the second division in 2025. With the departure of several club legends, experienced veterans, and long-serving ...",
    "fullText": "Incheon United embark on their first season back in K League 1 following promotion from the second division in 2025. With the departure of several club legends, experienced veterans, and long-serving squad members, the side that lines up on opening day will look very different from the team relegated so unceremoniously in 2024. After a year away and the highs of last season, what can Incheon expect on their return to the top tier, now shifting from favourites to underdogs?\n\n23 W - 9 D - 7 L, 1st (K League 2)\n\nA poor 2024 season, compounded by managerial mishaps, poor individual performances, and off-the-field issues, meant that Incheon United finished 12th and were relegated before the final game of the year.\n\nAs a result, Incheon spent 2025 battling to bounce back and achieve promotion at the first attempt. Standing in their way were a Suwon Bluewings side that had suffered a similar fate in 2023, a young and hungry Bucheon FC 1995 team, and a host of other clubs looking to claim a major scalp. Incheon were fortunate to retain a number of their more experienced players and, as such, were favourites on paper to return to the top flight before a ball had been kicked. Despite this, the journey back was not always straightforward.\n\nThey began the season strongly, recording 11 wins, a draw, and a defeat in the opening round-robin set of matches. From that point on, Incheon held a commanding lead at the summit of the table. As the season wore on, injuries and fatigue set in, but the team were able to keep their noses ahead of the competition, eventually finishing six points clear of Suwon Bluewings in second place, despite the Bluewings winning only two of their final five matches.\n\nIncheon have seen considerable turnover over the winter, with several notable departures.\n\nLong-time vice-captain Kim Do-hyeok is among the biggest names to leave the club following the end of the campaign. At Incheon since 2014, his role diminished significantly under Yoon last season, with the veteran managing just 320 minutes of action. The move to Gimpo FC represents a chance to maximise his remaining years in the game.\n\nHarrison Delbridge, who joined Incheon in 2021, was a mainstay in the heart of the defence but also found opportunities limited under the new regime. With his contract set to expire at the end of 2025, the former Australian international opted for a return to the A-League, rejoining Melbourne City.\n\nShin Jin-ho, a regular presence in the side last season, departed following the expiry of his contract. He featured 32 times across the campaign, making eight starts and contributing four goals and four assists. He has since joined K League 2 newcomers Yongin, where he has been named club captain.\n\nAmong the arrivals, the most intriguing is midfielder Iker Undabarrena, who arrives from Johor Darul Ta’zim in Malaysia. A lack of creativity in central areas was a recurring issue for Incheon last season—one that has lingered since the departure of Elías Aguilar in 2023. Whether Undabarrena can finally fill that void remains to be seen.\n\nKim Dong-heon has spent most of the previous two seasons fulfilling his military service with Gimcheon Sangmu. Now back at the club and looking to make an impact, Dong-heon will do battle with Lee Tae-hee for the Incheon goalkeeping spot.\n\nLast season, Incheon had five goalkeepers registered across different stages of the campaign; however, there was little dispute over who Yoon Jong-hwan preferred. Min Seong-jun spent most of the year as first choice, as Incheon conceded only 30 goals in their 39 K League 2 matches. Despite this, Seong-jun has been allowed to leave, with the club opting to retain Dong-heon and Tae-hee as their main goalkeeping options. From the perspective of many fans, Dong-heon is the preferred starter and harbours aspirations of breaking into the Korean national team squad for the 2026 World Cup. To achieve this, he will need to be at the top of his game for Incheon.\n\nAs a newly promoted side, Incheon will assume an underdog role in many of their matches. The key to success will be consistency and clean sheets. A fully fit and motivated Kim Dong-heon could be the difference between Incheon picking up points and falling short. Much is often made of the value of goals in tight games and the impact strikers can have, but the same is true of goalkeepers. Having a reliable set of hands and Dong-heon’s physical presence in goal could prove decisive in helping Incheon achieve their targets in 2026.\n\nIncheon manager Yoon Jong-hwan has never shied away from giving younger players opportunities in the first team. One beneficiary of this last season was Choi Seung-gu. The 20-year-old made his senior debut on the opening weekend and went on to feature 24 times across league and cup competitions, operating both at full-back and in central midfield. He also represented Korea at the U20 FIFA World Cup in Chile last autumn. Quick, robust in the tackle, and composed in possession, Choi will be keen to test his abilities against more competitive opponents in K League 1 this season.\n\nCan Incheon build on their success in 2026 and reestablish themselves as a K League 1 club?\n\nRelegation in 2024 was a huge blow to Incheon and, as a city-owned club, to the local government as well. The result was a change in both manager and CEO, with long-term chairman Jeon Dal-soo resigning from his role.\n\nTwelve months on, Incheon regained their top-flight status at the first attempt. Under Yoon Jong-hwan last season, Incheon played fast-paced, attacking football against teams that were happy to sit with eleven men behind the ball. This year, however, is likely to be very different, as Incheon will be underdogs in most matches.\n\nEarly-season games against Seoul, Daejeon, Gwangju, and Pohang will act as a useful measuring stick to see whether Incheon can once again compete with some of the stronger clubs from last season’s K League 1. In addition, Incheon have seen a significant number of players leave the club as Yoon looked to trim what might be considered - perhaps unfairly in some cases - the dead wood. With a need to maximise the budget provided by the city, every squad place counts. As a result, around twenty players departed over the winter break, with only a handful of players, as yet, joining to bolster the ranks.\n\nThose early fixtures will be vitally important as the club looks to put points on the board before the six-week World Cup break and the onset of the relentless Korean summer when the league resumes. There is blind optimism among many fans that the team will simply continue picking up points as they have over the past twelve months, but realistically, much bigger and stronger challenges lie ahead.\n\nIncheon’s first season back in K League 1 poses many questions ahead of the new campaign. In 2022 and 2023, Incheon looked to create stability around the club, and back-to-back top-six finishes suggested this was happening. The unexpected relegation in 2024 underlined that any club can be at risk if they go through a rough patch they cannot recover from.\n\nLast season marked a period of change for Incheon as they sought to reimagine their footballing identity under then-new coach Yoon Jong-hwan. Fast, attacking football replaced the slow, sideways passing of 2024. The hope is that the progress made and improvements in style of play will continue this year, but with a tough start in the opening month, Incheon will need to come out all guns blazing.\n\nIncheon start the season at home to FC Seoul. Tickets will be available from Tuesday 24th February at 2pm via the Ticketlink app. The match kicks off at 2pm on Saturday 28th February at Incheon's Sungui Arena Park.",

The university takes any allegation very seriously, and will cooperate with law enforcement. Due to federal and university privacy laws and practices for students, the university will not be able to provide additional comment.”\n\nAccording to the news release, the alleged victim reported that Kingston sexually assaulted her on Feb. 23, 2025, in St. George.\n\nThe release states that St. George Police detectives gathered “digital and forensic evidence” over the course of their investigation.\n\n“They also conducted interviews with the parties involved and other witnesses. The information was then turned over to the Washington County Attorney’s Office for review,” according to the release.\n\nKingston has been taken into custody and is currently being held in Washington County without bail. An initial appearance is scheduled in Utah’s 5th Judicial District Court on Friday.",

    "description": "A Pentagon plan to use a high-energy, counter-drone laser without having coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration about potential risks to civilian flights prompted Wednesday’s unprecedented airspace shutdown over El Paso, Texas, multiple sources tell CNN.",
    "fullText": "A Pentagon plan to use a high-energy, counter-drone laser without having coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration about potential risks to civilian flights prompted Wednesday’s unprecedented airspace shutdown over El Paso, Texas, multiple sources told CNN.\n\nA source familiar with the timeline of events said that the US military used the laser technology to shoot down four mylar balloons this week, contributing to the decision by the FAA to shut down local airspace.\n\nThose accounts come as the Trump administration has claimed that a Mexican cartel drone crossing into US airspace is what triggered the 10-mile restriction centered on El Paso International Airport.\n\nLate Tuesday, the FAA abruptly issued a temporary flight restriction that immediately grounded all flights up to 18,000 feet around the city for 10 days, effectively shutting down El Paso International Airport.\n\nRoughly eight hours later, the restriction was lifted. By the time the FAA had lifted the flight restrictions, airlines had already issued travel waivers and notified customers of potential changes.\n\nMultiple sources from the federal government and US airlines told CNN that military activity near El Paso, including US drones monitoring cartel operations and the Pentagon’s planned use of a high-energy laser designed to counter drones, raised immediate concerns for civilian traffic arriving and departing El Paso International Airport. Fort Bliss and its airfield, Biggs Army Airfield, sit just north of the commercial airport, which serves about 100 flights each day.\n\nFAA and Pentagon officials had been scheduled to meet February 20 to review potential impacts and mitigation measures for a test of the laser system, a technology the Pentagon has been testing in more remote areas of the country, multiple sources said. But the Defense Department sought to use the system sooner around El Paso, prompting the FAA to impose the temporary flight restriction until that coordination could occur. The 10-day restriction would have expired on February 21, one day after DoD and the FAA were set to meet.\n\nThe FAA’s decision to close the airspace was made without telling the White House first, according to people familiar with the matter. The issue became a topic of intense focus inside the West Wing in the early morning hours of Wednesday, as Texas lawmakers pressed for answers on why the airspace was suddenly closed without first alerting them.\n\nAn administration official said Wednesday morning that the shutdown was triggered by Defense Department “action to disable” cartel drones. It’s unclear if the presence of drones might have led to the acceleration of the deployment of the laser system.\n\nCNN reached out to the FAA and White House for comment about the differing explanations. The Pentagon on Wednesday continued to refer to the administration official’s statement about a drone breach having caused the airspace closure.\n\nSecretary of Transportation Sean Duffy posted to social media crediting the FAA and Defense Department with acting “swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion.”\n\n“The threat has been neutralized, and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region,” he wrote on X.\n\nIncursions along the southern border are extremely common and historically do not prompt such airspace closures. In 2024, for example, Air Force Gen. Greg Guillot, the commander of NORTHCOM, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the number of incursions along the US Mexico border was “over a thousand” each month.\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration and other US security agencies have used facilities at the Biggs Army Airfield for years as part of efforts to monitor Mexico-based drug cartel operations, current and former US officials said.\n\nEl Paso, with a population of nearly 700,000, is the sixth-largest city in Texas and one of the 25 largest in the United States. It is a hub of cross-border commerce alongside neighboring Ciudad Juárez in Mexico.\n\nNearly 3.5 million passengers passed through El Paso International Airport in the first 11 months of 2025, according to its website. The airport describes itself as the gateway to West Texas, southern New Mexico and northern Mexico.\n\nThe US military has been testing laser-based air defenses against drones in recent months. Last summer, the Army conducted a live-fire exercise using directed energy weapons alongside more traditional air defense systems at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. And last fall, the Army put out a request to industry for ideas on a counter-drone Enduring-High Energy Laser (E-HEL) weapon system.\n\nIn the initial flight restrictions, the FAA classified the area around El Paso﻿ as “(National) Defense Airspace” and said pilots who violated the restriction could be intercepted, detained and questioned by law enforcement.\n\nIt warned that additional actions could be taken for pilots who don’t adhere to the restrictions, including suspension of flight certifications, criminal charges, and that the US government “may use deadly force” if an aircraft poses an “imminent security threat.”\n\nThe sudden FAA restrictions seemed to catch pilots and air traffic controllers by surprise.\n\nAudio from LiveATC.net caught the moment pilots were made aware of the grounding.\n\n“Just pass it on to everybody else, at 06:30 for the next 10 days, we’re all at a ground stop,” a controller said.\n\nA pilot replied, “OK, ground stop 06:30 for how long?”\n\n“Ten days,” the controller replied.\n\n“So the airport is totally closed?” the pilot said, chuckling.\n\nThe controller replied, “Apparently, we just got informed about 30 minutes to an hour ago.”\n\n“So for 10 days you guys are not open,” the pilot said, in disbelief.\n\n“Well, we’ll be here, but no air traffic,” the controller said.\n\n“OK,” the pilot said while laughing.\n\nSamuel, a traveler in El Paso, told CNN affiliate KFOX he was doing a book tour with a client and didn’t get any notification from his airline.\n\n“I just kind of saw all the cops here and the news cameras,” he said. “I gotta figure out what’s going on if there’s another airport that’s not in El Paso, and try to figure out and rent a car out.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas told reporters Wednesday that the closure of the El Paso International Airport was solely a FAA decision and that local officials — including members of Congress — were left completely in the dark before it happened.\n\nShe stressed that she was not notified in advance despite representing the congressional district that’s home to the airport, Fort Bliss and the broader El Paso community.\n\n“They did not alert the El Paso city manager or the El Paso mayor,” Escobar said on a press call Wednesday morning. “Everyone locally on the ground was in the dark, and the impact, obviously, is highly consequential.”\n\nThe Associated Press and CNN’s Evan Perez, Kevin Liptak, Kit Mayer, Camila DeChalus, Karina Tsui, and Diego Mendoza contributed to this report.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.",

    "title": "Chroma Introduces BYOC",
    "description": "Chroma BYOC lets customers run Chroma inside their own cloud to meet strict security and compliance requirements, while still relying on Chroma’s team to operate and support the database in production.",
    "fullText": "To support enterprise customers with strict operational and security requirements, Chroma offers a “Bring Your Own Cloud” (BYOC) deployment model. This deployment option allows you to run Chroma within your own cloud infrastructure while still benefiting from management and support by Chroma's engineering team.\n\nHere are some of the key features of Chroma BYOC that differentiate it from other deployment models:\n\nThis post provides a technical overview of how the deployment model works in practice, to give an idea of what to expect when deploying and running Chroma BYOC in your own environment.\n\nBefore jumping into deploying Chroma BYOC, it’s important to first consider if it’s actually the correct deployment model for your use case. Though we designed the product to minimize operational burden, the added overhead of maintaining a Chroma BYOC deployment is non-zero, both for Chroma and for you. Additionally, under the BYOC model, you will run all of the infrastructure backing Chroma in your own cloud environment, meaning you will pay a fixed minimum cost for running the Chroma infrastructure.\n\nIt’s worth noting here that Chroma Cloud, our public managed version of distributed Chroma, was built with multi-tenancy, performance, and security as primary goals. It’s SOC II Type 2 compliant, includes a fully-featured dashboard UI, and provides usage-based billing. We find it to be a solid solution for most customers. That being said, probably the main reason why you would need Chroma BYOC is if your security and compliance requirements mandate that your data must reside within your own infrastructure. For those types of strict requirements, Chroma BYOC is by far the ideal deployment option, given that it includes operational support from the Chroma team for managing your mission-critical database infrastructure.\n\nAfter determining that Chroma BYOC is the right deployment model for your use-case, it’s time to get down to the nuts & bolts of sizing the Chroma deployment. The first step is to spec out your workload so that Chroma can help recommend a sufficiently-sized deployment.\n\nTo size a deployment, there are several questions to consider:\n\nFor a detailed breakdown of the concepts raised by these questions, you can refer to our docs page: Look at Your Data.\n\nAfter working with you to size your deployment, Chroma will generate a baseline cost estimate for running the infrastructure in your cloud environment. Now comes the exciting part, it’s time to deploy Chroma into your cloud.\n\nThere are two main components to deploying Chroma in your cloud environment: the cloud infrastructure (managed with Terraform), and the Kubernetes infrastructure (managed with ArgoCD). With this design, all of the Chroma infrastructure is managed through “infrastructure as code\", so it is versioned, repeatable, and all changes are trackable.\n\nFirst, you will deploy all of the supporting cloud infrastructure using the Terraform modules provided by Chroma. Notably, Chroma requires a storage bucket (for persistent collection data storage), a relational database (for collection metadata storage), a Kubernetes cluster (for compute), and a VPC network.\n\nChroma’s Terraform modules are deployed using Terragrunt. Terragrunt provides a convenience wrapper layer around Terraform. We find that using Terragrunt provides some nice-to-have features over Terraform, such as easier management of module dependencies and support for templating of provider configurations.\n\nThe Chroma deployment requires a few secrets for various purposes (such as API keys for exporting telemetry, a password for the RDS database, etc). These secrets are stored in your cloud provider’s secret manager (either AWS Secrets Manager or GCP Secret Manager) and they are made available to pods running in the Kubernetes cluster via the External Secrets Operator. To initialize the secrets for your Chroma deployment, you will push values into your cloud provider’s secret manager during the Terraform apply.\n\nAfter deploying the supporting cloud infrastructure, the next step is to bootstrap a GitOps management system for of all of the Kubernetes resources that comprise your Chroma BYOC deployment. This requires setting up a Github repo to act as the “source of truth” for your Kubernetes cluster’s desired state. Then, you will deploy ArgoCD into your Kubernetes cluster and configure it to continuously apply your desired state, thereby syncing the manifests from your Github repo into your Kubernetes cluster.\n\nWith the GitOps system in place, it’s easy to perform the initial Chroma Kubernetes resources deployment. After pushing a commit to the GitOps repo that adds the YAML manifests for the Chroma Kubernetes resources, ArgoCD will apply the YAML to your cluster.\n\nAt this point, congrats, you have deployed Chroma!\n\nAs a side note, beyond just the initial deployment, you and Chroma will use the GitOps repo to coordinate all changes to your deployment going forward. All modifications, config adjustments, and upgrades will be recorded in the git history, providing a reliable audit log. You will have the opportunity to review and approve every change via Github pull requests.\n\nIn addition to using ArgoCD to manage all of the Chroma Kubernetes resources, we also use ArgoCD to self-manage itself. This is possible through the “ArgoCD Declarative Setup” pattern. All of the ArgoCD desired state is defined in YAML, in the GitOps repo. And, ArgoCD is configured to continuously sync from the GitOps repo. Therefore it will reconcile its own desired state. This allows us to easily have ArgoCD update and manage ArgoCD’s own state through GitOps, in addition to Chroma.\n\nArgoCD Rendered Manifest Pattern\n\nIn an attempt to simplify our usage of ArgoCD, we have chosen to adopt the “Rendered Manifests Pattern” for the Chroma Kubernetes manifests, which removes cognitive overhead of reasoning about templating abstractions like Helm or Kustomize in your git → k8s sync process. While these templating tools are incredibly useful and provide obvious benefits for defining Kubernetes resource manifests (such as ability to avoid repetition a.k.a. DRY, ability to implement dependency logic, etc.), we find that it’s much simpler to store raw YAML in the GitOps repo and have ArgoCD sync the raw YAML (rather than storing a template in the GitOps repo and have ArgoCD render the template before applying it to your Kubernetes cluster). This way, there is no need to think through how the templating engine running in ArgoCD will transform your template, therefore making sync operations more predictable and reducing the risk of mistakes during updates.\n\nNow that you’ve deployed Chroma into your cloud environment, how will we maintain it going forwards? Chroma is a fast-moving product and we’re always adding new features. If you’d like to upgrade to a new version of Chroma with some of those new features, what’s the process?\n\nFortunately, after setting up the GitOps system during the initial deploy, it’s simple to perform any upgrades, config changes, or other “Day 2” operations. Anytime there is a new release of Chroma, we will push the new manifests to your GitOps repo via a GitHub PR. After you verify, approve, and merge the PR, the ArgoCD instance running in your Kubernetes cluster will detect the changes and apply them. Similarly, we will coordinate any config changes to your BYOC deployment through PRs to your GitOps repo. From a compliance perspective, this also works quite nicely. Every change must be approved before ArgoCD will apply it, and the entire change history will be tracked in your git repository.\n\nSometimes, rarely, Chroma upgrades will require changes to the supporting cloud infrastructure that is managed by Terraform. For these sorts of changes, Chroma will release new versions of our Terraform modules, and you will need to manually apply them (using Terragrunt) to update your cloud infrastructure before it will be possible to upgrade the Chroma Kubernetes deployment. While we don’t often change the supporting cloud infrastructure for Chroma, versioning our Terraform modules and recording the changes in your GitOps repository ensures that we maintain IaC best practices.\n\nAs part of the BYOC product, Chroma engineers are oncall 24/7 to help maintain your environment. As such, Chroma exports telemetry data to our observability platform that contains usage metrics, code execution traces, and CPU / memory profiling. We use the telemetry data to generate alerts if there is any issue or errors with your deployed environment, so that we can respond quickly and recommend effective solutions. None of the exported telemetry contains sensitive information about your environment or your Chroma data. All of the exported telemetry is in standard OpenTelemetry format, and can be forwarded to your team’s observability platform if you would like to maintain additional visibility of the telemetry data.\n\nWe’ve built the Chroma BYOC deployment model to provide the best of both worlds: a “managed” product that Chroma fully-supports where you maintain full control over the cloud infrastructure and your data sovereignty. The GitOps-based deployment method simplifies operations, upgrades, and maintenance by leveraging common open-source tools and cloud infrastructure best practices.\n\nUltimately, choosing Chroma BYOC over any other solution comes down to flexibility, developer experience, and long-term control. Chroma’s open-source foundation lets teams move seamlessly from experimentation to production without rethinking their architecture, while avoiding cloud vendor lock-in and keeping costs predictable with an efficient storage model. And when regulatory or security constraints require data to live inside your own environment, Chroma BYOC provides the same core advantages in addition to operational support from Chroma’s engineering team, making it the ideal choice for mission-critical workloads.\n\nKeep your search infrastructure and sensitive data within your own cloud environment while Chroma's team handles operations, upgrades, and 24/7 support.\n\nTalk to an engineer to get started.",

It was because each time he sat down, he'd ask himself the same question: \"is this even worth it?\" The gap between the idea and the finished thing was so wide that most ideas died in the middle.\n\nThe builder sat down one morning and built what used to take him a week. By lunch he'd run out of ideas he knew how to say out loud. The tools could build anything. He just couldn't always tell them what he wanted.\n\nThe builder was ecstatic. But beneath the ecstasy there was grief. The thing he loved doing, the hard part, the figuring-it-out part, the part that made him feel like himself, was eroding. He could feel it going and he was the one letting it go.\n\nHe didn't dwell on it. He was drunk with the power and possibility.\n\nSo he built. He couldn't stop. Every morning there was more to make and less reason not to.\n\nThen he looked back and realized he was on the verge of something inevitable: the last piece of software.\n\nYou don't build the last piece of software.

The gap between the problem and the solution. The gap between the idea and the thing. Each time he closed one, he felt alive. Each time he closed one, there was less of the work left to love.\n\nHe didn't know if he was mourning or if he was free.

    "title": "8 Phrases Only High-Level Thinkers Use In Everyday Conversations According To Recent Psychological Studies",
    "description": "Psychology says that these phrases are mostly used by super high-level thinkers.",
    "fullText": "Someone asked me last week why I always say \"I could be wrong\" before giving my opinion.\n\n\"You do it constantly,\" they said. \"It makes you sound unsure of yourself.\"\n\nBut I'm not unsure. I'm just aware that I might be missing information. That my perspective isn't the only valid one. That being certain about everything is usually a sign you're not thinking hard enough.\n\nI picked up that phrase from my boss years ago. She'd say it before making decisions, before giving feedback, before disagreeing with people. And at first, I thought it was a bad thing, and she didn't trust herself.\n\nBut the weird thing was, she was almost always right. Because she left room to be corrected. She invited people to challenge her thinking. And when they did, she adjusted. She wasn't protecting her ego—she was protecting the quality of her decisions.\n\nThat's when I started paying attention to how the smartest people I know actually talk. The words they use. The questions they ask. The phrases that show up over and over.\n\nHere are the phrases that separate high-level thinkers from everyone else.\n\nYou know the person who states every opinion like it's a settled fact? Who speaks with absolute certainty about things they learned five minutes ago?\n\nThat's not what high-level thinkers do.\n\nThey preface their statements with doubt. \"I could be wrong, but...\" \"I might be missing something, but...\"\n\nIt's called intellectual humility.\n\nResearch on decision-making found that people who regularly acknowledge uncertainty make better predictions and adjust faster when new information shows up. They're not attached to being right—they just want to know the truth.\n\nThis phrase creates space for correction. It signals openness to being wrong. And ironically, being willing to be wrong makes you right more often.\n\nSomeone disagrees with you. Your first thought is probably: they don't understand. If they understood what I understand, they'd agree with me.\n\nBut people who think at a higher level flip that assumption.\n\nThey ask themselves: \"What am I not seeing?\" \"What information do I not have?\" \"What perspective am I missing?\"\n\nStudies on collaborative problem-solving show that assuming gaps in your own knowledge leads to better solutions than assuming gaps in others' understanding.\n\nI catch myself doing this now when I'm certain I'm right and someone's pushing back. Instead of getting frustrated, I ask what I'm missing. Half the time, turns out I was missing something big.\n\nSomeone says something that sounds ridiculous to you. Dead wrong. Completely off base.\n\nAnd instead of correcting them, you ask them to keep talking.\n\nAccording to research on productive dialogue, people who delay their reactions and invite elaboration reach mutual understanding significantly faster than those who immediately counter-argue.\n\nSometimes they explain, and you realize they're right.\n\nSometimes you both discover the issue is more complex than either of you thought.\n\nSometimes you still disagree, but at least you understand why.\n\nThe smartest people I know use this phrase constantly, because they genuinely want to understand before they respond.\n\nChanging your mind feels embarrassing.\n\nSo most people stick with positions they no longer believe. They defend ideas they've privately abandoned. They'd rather be consistently wrong than inconsistently right.\n\nHigh-level thinkers announce it.\n\n\"I used to think X, but now I think Y.\"\n\n\"This new information shifted my perspective.\"\n\nResearch tracking intellectual flexibility found something surprising: people who openly acknowledge changing their minds are seen as more credible, not less. The willingness to update your views signals you're learning.\n\nBesides, sticking with a belief after evidence contradicts it is just stubbornness.\n\nA lot of people feel compelled to have opinions on everything.\n\nPolitics, economics, science, medicine, education—it doesn't matter if they've never studied it. They'll weigh in with confidence anyway.\n\nThe sharpest thinkers do the opposite. They say they don't know enough to have an informed opinion, that the topic is outside their area, that they haven't studied it enough to comment.\"\n\nStudies on actual expertise show a pattern: real experts readily admit the boundaries of their knowledge. The more someone knows, the more they recognize how much they don't know.\n\nWhen someone easily says \"I don't know,\" it's often a sign they know a lot. They just understand where their knowledge ends.\n\nIt's very hard not to have a physical reaction to someone saying something you disagree with. The tempting move is to explain why they're wrong.\n\nPeople who think more deeply take a different approach.\n\n\"Help me understand how you're looking at this.\" \"Walk me through your reasoning.\" \"What led you there?\"\n\nResearch on persuasion found that people who approach disagreements with genuine curiosity change more minds than people who approach with correction. Understanding doesn't mean agreeing—it just means you grasp their position well enough to engage honestly.\n\nThis shifts the energy. It turns a debate into a dialogue. And in dialogue, people actually think instead of just defending.\n\nThree words. The hardest phrase to say.\n\nSomeone asks you something, and you don't know the answer. Instead of guessing or deflecting or making something up, you just say it: \"I don't know.\"\n\nIt feels vulnerable. Like you should know. Like not knowing makes you look stupid.\n\nBut high-level thinkers just admit it. And then, if it matters, they find out.\n\nI've started doing this at work. Someone asks me something I'm unsure about, and instead of faking confidence, I say: \"I don't know. Let me check and get back to you.\" It's never hurt me. Usually it helps. Because I'm not giving people wrong information.\n\nThis question separates thinking from identity.\n\nIf someone can tell you what evidence would change their mind, they're thinking. Their position is based on reasoning. They're open to persuasion if the right information shows up.\n\nIf they can't answer—if nothing would change their mind—then their belief isn't based on evidence. It's part of who they are.\n\nStudies on belief formation found that just asking people to consider what would change their minds increases intellectual humility and reduces polarization. The act of considering the question makes people more flexible.\n\nPeople who think at the highest level ask this of themselves and others. Not to trap anyone. But to figure out if the conversation is worth having. If both people are genuinely thinking, a productive conversation is possible.\n\nThese phrases don't make you smarter by themselves. But they signal something crucial about high-level thinkers: they're more interested in truth than being right. They're open to learning instead of just defending. They see conversations as chances to think better, not battles to win. And that shift is what actually separates the people who think at a high level from people who just think they do.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats took to the Senate floor Wednesday to deliver impassioned speeches denouncing the Justice Department’s attempt to indict a group of lawmakers who last year urged U.S. military members to resist “illegal orders,” framing the episode as a dire test for their chamber and the rule of law.\n\n“The fact that they failed to incarcerate a United States senator should not obviate our outrage. They tried to incarcerate two of us,” said Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii. “I am not entirely sure the United States Senate can survive this if we do not have Republicans standing up.”\n\nSchatz was among a string of Democratic senators who spoke a day after a Washington grand jury declined to indict six Democratic lawmakers, including Sens. Elissa Slotkin and Mark Kelly, over a 90-second video that drew fierce backlash from President Donald Trump.\n\nWhile Democrats blasted the Trump administration, they also challenged their Republican colleagues to speak out. Sen. Chris Murphy called it a “test for the Senate\" that \"could break this institution permanently.”\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Slotkin and Kelly praised the grand jury’s decision, with Slotkin saying that “if things had gone a different way, we’d be preparing for arrest.”\n\n“A group of anonymous Americans upheld the rule of law and determined that this case should not proceed,” she said.\n\nThe failed indictments mark a high-profile setback for the Justice Department, which has faced mounting scrutiny from Democrats and some Republicans over investigations seen as aligned with Trump’s political grievances. The episode has raised stark First Amendments questions about the potential prosecution of sitting members of Congress for their speech.\n\n\"This is not a good news story,” Kelly said. “This is a story about how Donald Trump and his cronies are trying to break our system in order to silence anyone who lawfully speaks out against them.”\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer similarly framed the attempt as a broader free speech threat, saying that if Trump “believes that he can even attempt to jail senators over speech he dislikes, then the First Amendment is no longer a basic right.”\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said the Justice Department's response “wouldn’t have been my response to that, but we are where we are.”\n\n“The indictment didn’t withstand the scrutiny of a grand jury. It was clear it was not going anywhere,” Thune said.\n\nKelly and Slotkin said during a joint press conference that they have not been told what charges prosecutors sought, and it's unclear whether prosecutors plan to keep pursuing the case. The senators sent a letter Wednesday asking the Justice Department to confirm the investigation is now closed, they said.\n\nThe two senators and four House members have been embroiled in fallout from the video for months. Trump reacted angrily to their video, labeling it “seditious” and saying on social media that the offense was “punishable by death.”\n\nAll six of the Democratic lawmakers who appeared in the 90-second video served in the military or intelligence community. They said the video’s purpose was to simply affirm existing law after receiving outreach from members of the military.\n\nOn the other side of the Capitol, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana said the video warrants criminal scrutiny. He told MSNow News late Wednesday that the lawmakers “probably should be indicted.”\n\n“Anytime you’re obstructing law enforcement and getting in the way of these sensitive operations, it’s a very serious thing, and it probably is a crime. And, yeah, they probably should be indicted,” he said.",

    "description": "\"I’m really scared,\" Austin Appelbee told the police dispatcher after his heroic act last month",
    "fullText": "A 13-year-old boy swam miles to call for help when his family was swept out to sea off the coast of Australia on Jan. 30\n\nThis week, police released the heroic emergency phone call that the teen made once he reached the shore\n\n“I don’t know what their condition is right now,” the child told the dispatcher\n\nAfter a 13-year-old boy swam almost three miles back to shore to save family members who had been swept out to sea, Australian officials have released his call to emergency dispatch.\n\n“We got swept out to sea, and we got lost out there,” Austin Appelbee said on the emergency triple-zero phone call that he made after he and his family got pulled far off the coast of Quindalup, in Geographe Bay, on Jan. 30, according to a recording and statement shared by the Western Australia Police Force.\n\n“I don’t know what their condition is right now,” he told the dispatcher later, after detailing his location and what occurred. “I’m really scared.”\n\nThat Friday evening, Appelbee, his mom, Joanne, and his two siblings, Beau, 12, and Grace, 8, were kayaking and paddleboarding off the coast of Western Australia when they were swept far out to sea, the Western Australia Police Force said in its statement.\n\nThat’s when the 13-year-old boy decided to return to shore, despite the “fading light and deteriorating conditions,” according to police.\n\nThe teen was able to paddle a short distance before his kayak took on water, officials said. With no other options, the boy swam approximately two-and-a-half miles to shore.\n\n“I didn't think I was a hero — I just did what I did,” Austin told the BBC of the risk he took to save his family.\n\nJoanne told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that asking her eldest child to go for help was “one of the hardest decisions I ever had to make.”\n\nOnce on shore, the teen ran more than a mile along the beach to reach a mobile phone, according to police.\n\n“We got lost around about, I don’t know what time it was, but it was a very long time ago, we couldn’t get back to shore and Mum told me to go back to get help … we’re in massive trouble,” he told the dispatcher, according to the recording. “I haven’t seen them since. I think they’re kilometres out in sea, I think we need helicopters to go find them.”\n\nMeanwhile, Austin asked for an ambulance because he feared he had hypothermia and could pass out because he was dizzy.\n\nThe family was treated at a local hospital and later released without serious injury, according to authorities.\n\nWhile releasing an emergency call isn’t standard procedure, the Western Australia Police Force received permission from Austin’s mom to share the recording to educate others about how to respond during an emergency situation.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nIn its statement, the Western Australia Police Force praised the teen’s “calm, clear communication,” which helped save the lives of his mom and two younger siblings.\n\n“What Austin did was nothing short of extraordinary,” said Police Forward Commander Acting Sergeant Andrew McDonnell, who coordinated the rescue effort, in a statement. “His bravery and courage in those conditions were remarkable, and his actions were pivotal in bringing about a successful outcome.”\n\nThe Western Australia Police Force added that they hope they can “join forces” with Austin in the future.",

    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates are tracking lower, as the 10-year Treasury has fallen over the past week. Economic news is pressuring the bond market and today's jobs report will be key to how mortgage rates finish the week. According to Zillow, the average 30-year fixed rate remains under 6%, currently 5.87%. The 15-year fixed rate is 5.34%.\n\nStill under 6%: See which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nLearn about how mortgage rates are determined.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various interest rates and loan amounts will affect your monthly payments. It also shows how the term length plays into things.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. You even have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues if those apply to you. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThere are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.\n\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.\n\nThe main disadvantage of 30-year fixed mortgage rates is the mortgage interest, both in the short and long term.\n\nA 30-year fixed-term loan comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed-term loan. You’ll also pay much \n\nThe pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are essentially swapped with those of 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.\n\nHowever, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.\n\nDetermine whether to get a 15-year vs. 30-year mortgage.\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined period, then adjust it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.\n\nThe main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't reflect this, though — fixed rates are actually lower, according to Zillow data. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)\n\nWith an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.\n\nBut if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.\n\nRead about the differences between adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgages.\n\nThe national average 30-year mortgage rate is 5.87% right now, according to Zillow. But keep in mind that averages can vary depending on where you live. For example, mortgage rates vary by state, and if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be higher.\n\nMortgage rates fell recently when President Trump announced some proposals to enhance home affordability and lower mortgage rates. Then, they moved higher when his push for Greenland raised international tension. Still, according to Zillow, rates remain well a over a half-point lower than a year ago.\n\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.\n\nMortgage rates often decrease before a Federal Reserve meeting rather than after. So, what should you expect rates to do before the Fed meeting on January 27-28?\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac already buy mortgage bonds, and Trump wants them to purchase $200 billion in bonds. Would this strategy cause mortgage rates to decrease?\n\nAverage mortgage rates are in the low 6% range, but there are ways to snag a lower rate. Learn about eight strategies for securing a mortgage rate under 6%.\n\nChase Home Lending has launched a mortgage refinance rate sale, and borrowers have until Sunday to lock in a discounted rate. Here's how to qualify and apply.\n\nInterest rates on HELOCs and home equity loans work differently. So, how much interest can you expect to pay on a second mortgage? Learn how these rates work.",

    "fullText": "Feb 10 (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors have released bodycam footage in the case of a Chicago woman who survived being shot multiple times by a Border Patrol agent during an immigration crackdown last fall, part of a ‌trove of evidence that casts doubt on the Trump administration's account of the incident.\n\nSoon after the shooting, the U.S. Department ‌of Homeland Security said Marimar Martinez, a U.S. citizen, had rammed the agents with her car. But the footage suggested that the agents could have struck her vehicle themselves.\n\nVideo, ​emails and other records were released by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago late on Tuesday after a district court judge said that the government had shown \"zero concern\" about Martinez's reputation.\n\nMartinez, a Montessori school teacher in Chicago, was following the agents on October 4 to warn residents of their presence when the collision occurred. In the bodycam video released Tuesday, one agent could be heard saying \"do something, bitch\" shortly before the vehicles ‌made contact.\n\nAn agent in the vehicle, driven by ⁠Charles Exum, said they were being boxed in. \"It's time to get aggressive,\" he said, adding \"we're going to make contact.\" After the collision, Exum stepped out of the vehicle and fired five shots.\n\nMartinez drove off, and was ⁠taken by ambulance to a local hospital. The Department of Homeland Security released a statement after the shooting saying that Martinez had \"ambushed\" the border patrol vehicle, and that an agent had fired in self-defense.\n\nMartinez, 31, was indicted on charges of impeding a federal officer. The charges were dropped in November, ​but ​the DHS statement labeling her a \"domestic terrorist\" has remained online.\n\nMartinez said she sought ​the release after the fatal shootings by federal immigration ‌agents of protesters Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis last month and to clear her name. Her lawyer, Christopher Parente, said on Tuesday that she also planned to file a civil lawsuit.\n\nAGENT BRAGGED ABOUT MARKSMANSHIP\n\nIn the bodycam footage, agents, including Exum, could be seen inside a Border Patrol vehicle driving as protesters honked their horns outside.\n\nIn the moments before the collision, an agent said \"We're gonna make contact and we are boxed in,\" just before the video showed Exum, at the wheel, turn the steering wheel sharply to the left.\n\n\"Be advised we've ‌been struck, we've been struck,\" the agent wearing the bodycam said into a ​radio.\n\nExum then opened the door with his weapon drawn.\n\nDuring Martinez’s court case, evidence was ​shared that Exum had driven the vehicle, a Chevy Tahoe, back ​to his base in Maine, and that repairs were made by a Customs and Border Protection mechanic before ‌the defendants could examine it.\n\nText messages from Exum also ​surfaced in court including one in ​which he bragged about his marksmanship in a group chat with other agents. \"I fired 5 rounds and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book, boys,\" he wrote.\n\nThe records released on Tuesday also included an email sent the afternoon of the ​shooting by Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, who ‌was demoted from his post as commander-at-large, overseeing operations in Los Angeles, Chicago and Minneapolis, following Pretti's death.\n\nBovino thanked ​Exum for his \"excellent service\" in Chicago and suggested that the agent postpone his retirement. \"You have much left to do!\" ​he wrote.",

    "fullText": "Toyota (TM) is expanding its electric vehicle (EV) lineup, with the revamped 2027 Highlander.\n\nYahoo Finance Senior Autos Reporter Pras Subramanian joins Market Domination host Josh Lipton to share the latest.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.\n\nToyota is not shying away from EVs with its all-electric next generation 2027 Toyota Highlander. Now Finance's Pras Subramanian is joining us with the latest. So, Pras, some auto makers they're they're they're shying away from EVs. Toyota, still looking committed.\n\nYeah, I think it's an interesting move here, right? This day and age to introduce a three-row EV SUV, and that's the Highlander is. Look, the the original Highlander was a gas-powered car and it and it they it went away as then the Grand Highlander came out, bigger SUV. And now they're kind of inserting this Highlander EV there, right? So it's be three rows still, uh 320 miles of range, uh pretty interesting there. Uh pretty decent size inside and a kind of a angular sleek designer. But the the big question here is, these bigger EVs can be kind of expensive and it's and do customers really want them, right? So, you know, uh David Christ, who's the uh Toyota North America VP, uh was at an event last night at the debut and here's what he had to say about why the Highlander does make sense as an EV.\n\nWe believe that battery electric vehicles are an important part of the industry, and we want to make multiple available to customers. We went from one to four in 2026, so we're really excited about that selection for customers, not only in pricing, but also in size and capabilities.\n\nToyota will now have four EVs on sale this year. The new Highlander, uh the bZ, which is their pre-existing EV, which is kind of like almost like a uh like a RAV4. You got the CHR, which is kind of a smaller EV. Then you have the larger bZ Woodland, which is like an extended version of the bZ. So, they're trying to kind of have a little bit of a product portfolio of EVs. But no, Toyota's huge in hybrids too. So, they're kind of trying to hedge their bets.\n\nDo they, do we have a a price on this one yet? Did they reveal that?\n\nWe don't have a price yet, but the main competitors are the Kia EV9, which is very well received, uh and the the twin of it, which is the Hyundai Ionic 9. The Kia starts around $55,000-ish starting. So, I would anticipate that that Toyota would would start there around around there as well. But, you know, Toyota has a better name recognition, a better value, uh in terms of the brand itself. So maybe they'll charge a bit more, but they can't go too high, right? Because then you're turning off customers.\n\nUm, I read your very good report on this. You mentioned how they're going to assemble this one, the Highlander, in the US, Kentucky. What are the advantages of that of that decision?\n\nI mean, look, tariffs. Big one, right? So, building in Kentucky, the battery modules will be built in a a North Carolina plant in the US. So, you're going to avoid all that. Now, you got materials coming in from places and you have to pay tariffs on that. But this is a pure American-ba- built EV, large scale EV. You don't really have that much in the US other than the uh the Rivian R1S, I believe. The Korean auto makers are making them in Korea, right? So, uh, well, actually, they're going to start making them in in Georgia, too. So, it's all part of the mix of of of onshoring this production and EVs are a part of that.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Pras. Appreciate it.",

    "title": "5 Unexpected Reasons Retirees Regret Moving To Beach Towns",
    "description": "Retiring near the beach is the dream of many Americans, but there are several practical reasons some retirees may not enjoy life by the coast.",
    "fullText": "Islands and Yahoo may earn commission from links in this article. Pricing and availability are subject to change.\n\nSurely the most cliched version of the perfect retirement is spending the rest of your days on a beach. Maybe you picture yourself sitting languorously in a sun chair, a parasol-speared drink in one hand, a Cuban in the other, mulling over the day's most important decision: to nap, or not to nap? Heavenly though that might seem, moving to the beach can come with unexpected frustrations, and not just the sand that finds a way of getting itself everywhere.\n\nDespite the obvious allure of a beachbound retirement, some retirees who make the move discover it's not all sunshine and cocktails. Some of America's beach destinations are desperately hot and humid, which can trigger maladies like heatstroke. In the likes of Florida, where you'll find some of America's most dangerous beaches, you can add hurricanes and regular storms into the mix, causing home insurance premiums to spike. Because beach towns are desirable, the cost of living can be high, tourists tend to swarm them in the summer months, and, conversely, the winters can be isolating and miserable. Never mind that if you're somewhere really rural, amenities like transport and medical care will be fewer and further between.\n\nBased on a survey by financial services company The Motley Fool, which sought to identify the best retirement locations in the U.S. for 2026, the most important factor for retirees was quality of life. The Motley Fool's analysis found that the two best destinations to retire in the U.S. were coastal Florida counties with access to the beach — Broward and St. Johns — which also had the highest quality of life scores. So perhaps the most important decision for a beach town retirement is simply choosing the right beach. The following five reasons retirees regret moving to beach towns should help inform your decision.\n\nHalf the point of moving to the beach is for the weather, but alongside days of radiant sunshine, expect a few where conditions are more challenging. Florida, America's best retirement state according to multiple rankings, is also the most hurricane-battered corner of the country. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 40% of all hurricanes in the U.S. hit Florida. Other states subjected to occasional hurricanes — Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, the Carolinas — also have beaches lining their Gulf or Atlantic coasts.\n\nSome hurricanes wreak widespread destruction. Hurricane Katrina, which hit New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in 2005, killed over 1,800 people, left millions homeless, and caused roughly $160 billion in damage. Category 5 hurricanes — the strongest, most destructive category — aren't common; only four have made landfall in the U.S. since records began. But tropical storms and cyclones, usually a threat in summer and early fall, pose their own problems for beach town residents. Storm surges can raise the water level by 20-plus feet, damaging property and coastal habitats, and ruining critical infrastructure like roads, bridges, power grids, and pipelines.\n\nZippy and Alan Sandler, an elderly couple living in Fort Pierce, Florida, told AARP of the stress caused by hurricanes Helene and Milton in 2024. \"People tell you afterwards, 'Call the insurance company. Take a lot of photos. Document everything.' But there's no cell or WIFI. And 'Make sure you're safe,'\" said Zippy. \"I don't know what that means. Does that mean water and plumbing? Cleaning up the glass in the dark? I'm 70 years old. How do I do this?\" Unfortunately, things could get bleaker. Garrison Flood Control, a manufacturer of flood control systems, reckons 2.5 million Americans, in coastal areas throughout the country, will be at risk of severe flooding during storm season by 2050.\n\nBased on Go Banking Rates' list of the most expensive places to buy a property in every state, many of the priciest locales are beach towns. If you're buying a house in Maine's Kennebunkport or Kennebunk, a charming town with delicious seafood and sandy beaches, expect to pay in excess of $1 million. In North Carolina's Wrightsville Beach, you'll be forking out double that. Hanalei, Hawaii, might be gorgeous, but the median house price of more than $4 million is less appealing. And in Florida's Jupiter Island, where many of the U.S.-based pro golfers live, the median home costs a truly eye-watering $9.5 million.\n\nThe high costs don't stop at the housing market. Because beach towns often see a good tourist trade — there are estimated to be 3.4 billion beach visits in America annually — prices rise commensurately. For residents of popular beach towns along the east coast, from Nantucket to Miami, the monthly day-to-day expenditure is often more than $2,000, while the overall cost of living, including mortgages, healthcare, taxes, and insurance premiums, could bump your outgoings to more than $10,000 per month. In a subreddit on retiring on the Oregon coast, users bemoaned the lack of accessible healthcare and the prohibitive cost of living. \"Honestly, you aren't going to find much unless it's a mobile home, tiny home (if you don't mind small), or a rental,\" wrote one. \"$3000 a month is doable if you budget properly which includes your health care.\"\n\nInsurance premiums are another big cost. According to Bankrate, hurricane-prone Louisiana and Florida are the states with the second- and third-highest homeowners insurance rates, respectively. The average premium in Louisiana costs $6,274, and in Florida it's $5,838. Beach dwellers often require policy add-ons covering severe flood and hurricane insurance, which could add an extra $1,000 or more to your base fee.\n\nBeach destinations across the U.S. have suffered the effects of tourism for decades, whether it's overcrowding on the beach; logjam traffic in the streets; interminable restaurant waiting times; or the general noise, litter, drunkenness, ballooning prices, and environmental degradation that comes when large groups of people congregate in one place. Once again, this is not an isolated issue: Beach towns in Florida, Virginia, and the Carolinas, as well as California, Oregon, and Washington, bear scars from the tourist crowds.\n\nOutsiders descending on a town can be more than a nuisance. If the number of arrivals exceeds the number the town is capable of accommodating, it stresses local infrastructure, like waste management, public transport, and emergency response. Though tourism brings an economic windfall, residents in many beach towns believe the negatives outweigh the positives. In Laguna Beach, California, locals have found adult toys and other miscellaneous rubbish on the beach and witnessed tourists wading into fragile tidepool habitats and lifeguards pulling more than 2,000 people from the water in a single holiday weekend.\n\nBeach town residents in Florida, Maine, and Alaska have tried to limit the number of tourists. In Bar Harbor, Maine, a town with a population of around 5,500 and up to 4 million tourist visits annually, residents voted to reduce the number of daily cruise ship passenger arrivals to 1,000 during peak season. In the book \"Overtourism: Lessons for a Better Future,\" an extract of which was published on Country & Town House, the authors noted, \"A number of coastal, beach, and island destinations have used improved stewardship to build a 'culture' that controls overtourism,\" referencing U.S. destinations like Hanauma Bay in Hawaii, Cape Cod in Massachusetts, and California's Catalina Island. Such cases show that when the wherewithal is there, residents can effect change.\n\nFor the most part, humans need community. Health researchers quoted in The Harvard Gazette went as far as putting social connection up there with food, shelter, and water as a basic human need. Catherine Dulac, a molecular biologist and neuroscientist at Harvard, told the Gazette, \"Our discovery of similar neural circuit architectures to encode social need and physiological needs such as the needs for water, food, and sleep directly illustrates how fundamental social interactions are for healthy lives.\"\n\nMissing out on those social connections can cause retirees to struggle after moving to a beach town. \"Moved to the Grand Strand area a couple years ago with my spouse, optimistic, being newly retired. Absolutely love the beach, but it's way harder than expected to make friends, even after joining various meetup groups,\" said one Reddit user in a forum about life in Myrtle Beach. \"Challenging to find a sense of community. Have never had difficulty making friends before, but I guess we don't neatly fit into any group.\"\n\nIn many beach towns, there's a mass exodus during fall and winter, as tourists and seasonal workers leave, and second-homers head back to their main house in the city. In Ocean City, Maryland, for example, the weekend summer population reaches 300,000, compared to the year-round residential population of fewer than 7,000. Colder temperatures and more hours of darkness also keep residents indoors, making family and friends feel even farther away. This feeling is often exacerbated by the limited medical care resources and public transportation access in rural towns. Fears over such isolation are why retirees so often choose retirement communities — in Florida you can even find ones that require little to no savings — where social connections are part of the package.\n\nSome beachy states offer tax boons to residents: Florida famously has no income tax, although this is somewhat countered by the high cost of living and property prices. But beach towns can also be struck by unforeseen tax hikes. In Rhode Island, for example, residents may be subjected to what's known as the \"Taylor Swift Tax.\" The pop star bought a home in the affluent Watch Hill neighborhood of Westerly back in 2013. A recently introduced levy has imposed surcharges on second homes in the state valued over $1 million, and those surcharges will work in addition to any other property taxes. Donna Krueger-Simmons, a local real estate agent, told CNBC that it was \"a smack in the face\" to people that already spend money there.\n\nSwift isn't the only cause of skyrocketing taxes in beach communities. In Surf City, North Carolina, a property tax increase of 30% was approved in 2025 to help fund local emergency services (especially during extreme weather events), manage large projects, and invest in the future. This is comparatively paltry compared to the 87% property tax increase faced by residents of New York's Atlantic Beach. According to the (now former) mayor, George Pappas, the astronomical figure would help make up for the previous administration's costly accounting errors — even though Pappas had been in charge for more than a decade.\n\nIt's for reasons like these that anyone planning a post-retirement relocation should keep abreast of the local tax obligations and financial state of their new hometown before committing to the move. That said, you can't always account for the whims of celebrities or blunders of government officials, so having a cash buffer in the event that your tax costs jump is always a good idea.\n\nReady to discover more hidden gems and expert travel tips?",

    "fullText": "SAN JOSE, Calif. (KRON) — Text messages from Shannon O’Connor, also known as the “Los Gatos Party Mom,” were shown to 12 jurors on Tuesday, including one stating, “What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.”\n\nProsecutors displayed O’Connor’s text messages in the courtroom to show evidence that the mother of two actively encouraged underage teenagers and their friends to drink alcohol.\n\nO’Connor, 50, is accused of giving copious amounts of alcohol to Los Gatos High School students, pressuring minors to engage in sexual activities with each other while the mother watched, as well as organizing secret parties at her house and in vacation rentals.\n\nThe text messages show in court Tuesday were exchanged during a family trip to Las Vegas in the summer of 2020, when O’Connor’s son was 14 years old and about to enter high school. A girl who is an alleged victim in the case, identified as “Jane Doe 7,” also went on the trip.\n\nAs soon as the group’s plane landed in Las Vegas, O’Connor’s son wrote in the group message chat, “Someone give me a f**king beer.” His mother replied, “I’m down. Champagne? (Let’s) hit the pool with drinks, lots of drinks.”\n\nParents trusted Los Gatos Party Mom ‘100 percent,’ witness testifies\n\nAn investigator testified that it’s unclear if the “Party Mom’s” wealthy husband went on the Las Vegas trip.\n\nDozens of witnesses have testified for the trial that began in December. O’Connor has pleaded not guilty to 63 charges. The alleged victims are 12 girls, identified as “Jane Does,” and eight boys, identified as “John Does.”\n\nHer relationships with her son’s friends went beyond being considered a “cool mom,” John Doe 5 previously testified. She was more like one of the “popular girls” in the group, and she controlled which teenagers were excluded or included around the popular crowd, he testified. O’Connor tried to control who “hooked up” or dated, according to testimony.\n\n“Party Mom” allegedly used Snapchat to communicate with teens without their parents’ knowledge. When a prosecutor asked John Doe 5 why he felt like it was normal to frequently talk to a woman in her 40s about sex, he said, “Looking back on it, it’s pretty weird.”\n\nOn Tuesday, country music blared inside the courtroom while a prosecutor played a cellphone video showing one wild pool party at O’Connor’s house in May of 2020. Boys are seen dancing around O’Connor’s pool, jacuzzi, and diving board. An investigator explained that the mother recorded the video while sitting in her kitchen and looking through glass doors that led to the pool area.\n\nThe investigator testified that the video was relevant because some of the sexual assaults between minors happened in the jacuzzi. The video shows that, even if O’Connor was inside the kitchen area, she could still clearly see what was happening in the pool area, according to testimony.\n\nAt a party on New Year’s Eve in 2020, the mother allegedly watched a boy sexually assault “Jane Doe 3” in the jacuzzi while the victim was so intoxicated “she could barely hold her head above water,” court documents state.\n\nProsecutors said O’Connor was the only adult present for the boozy and dangerous parties.\n\n“When defendant threw parties for children, she did everything she could to hide these parties from adults and authorities. She told (the teens) if anyone found out, she could go to jail,”  Deputy District Attorney Joanna Lee wrote.\n\nThe parties turned into an “enormously traumatic period of their lives” for the Los Gatos High School students who attended, Lee wrote.",

    "fullText": "Give a medal — hopefully, one that doesn’t break — to the engineers in Milan.\n\nAmid backlash from a rash of medals breaking during these 2026 Winter Olympics, an official claimed a fix has been made and those with busted hardware can swap their medals for new ones.\n\n“Following reports of issues affecting a small number of medals, the organizing committee immediately reviewed the matter, working closely with the State Mint, which produced the medals,” spokesperson Lucas Casassa said, according to The Guardian. “A solution has been identified, and a targeted fix has been put in place. Athletes whose medals have been affected are encouraged to return them through the appropriate channels so that they can be promptly repaired and returned.\n\n“Milano Cortina 2026 remains fully committed to ensuring that medals, which represent the pinnacle of every athlete’s journey, meet the highest standards of quality and care.”\n\nWhile there is always focus on who is winning medals, it’s not good publicity when there is focus on whether said medals will remain around participants’ necks.\n\nA source told Reuters that the issue may be connected to the clasp and the ribbon on the medals.\n\nThe outlet said the medals have a breakaway mechanism that is legally required to prevent potential strangulation or other injuries, while The Guardian further explained that the medal is set up for the mechanism to disengage if yanked with force since that protects against choking.\n\nThe Olympic committee surely would love for this supposed fix to lessen — if not outright squash — the noticeable number of athletes who have highlighted the subpar medals.\n\nU.S. figure skater Alysa Liu posted an Instagram video of her gold medal and the ribbon being separated, while gold medalist downhill skier Breezy Johnson showed her separated medal during a press conference.\n\nSee today’s Olympics schedule and medal count\n\nWinter Olympics men’s hockey tourney will get asterisk with Russia’s absence\n\nIce skater narrowly avoids points deduction after wardrobe malfunction\n\nU.S. women’s hockey team demolishes rival Canada for third straight shutout at 2026 Olympics\n\nOlympic medalist Sturla Holm’s ex-girlfriend breaks silence after his public affair confession\n\nThe German biathlon team even joined the piling on in an Instagram post, asking what’s up with the medals.\n\n“Don’t jump in them. I was jumping in excitement, and it broke,” Johnson said Sunday. “I’m sure somebody will fix it. It’s not crazy broken, but a little broken.”\n\nJake Paul’s fiancée, Jutta Leerdam, posted a TikTok video celebrating her gold medal only to be crushed mid-video when it broke.\n\n“I broke it,” she said. “I broke it.”\n\nSaid Paul: “Yeah, it keeps breaking. I’ll fix it again.”\n\nUSA skier Jacqueline Wiles reportedly was the latest medalist Tuesday to encounter medal issues after celebrating a third-place finish.\n\n“Some arms were swinging and I was jumping,” Wiles said, per Reuters. “And it got out of hand a little quickly. But that’s OK. They fixed it already.”",

    "fullText": "A South Los Angeles high school teacher says he was fired for insubordination after opening a gate to prevent students from getting hurt during anti-ICE school walkouts.\n\nStudents, parents and community groups are protesting the firing, calling the punishment excessive and demanding the teacher’s reinstatement.\n\nThe charter school says it follows LAUSD safety policies and emphasizes that decisions about students leaving campus are made by school administrators.\n\nLOS ANGELES - \"I was just concerned about their safety,\" says Ricardo Lopez. The popular U.S. History and AP U.S. History teacher says he was fired for insubordination at Synergy Quantum Charter High School in South Los Angeles, when students were trying to jump a fence and join the ongoing anti-ICE walkouts at schools all over Southern California.\n\nHe says he saw students jumping a fence last Wednesday, explaining he had already seen other students hurt themselves when doing the same thing the day prior. So, \"As the closest adult to them, I just opened the gate.\"\n\nWithin an hour, Lopez was terminated and marched off campus. His belongings, including dozens of paintings and projects by students, were put in a couple of boxes and dropped off in the driveway of his home.\n\nSchool officials say that even as a charter, they adhere to LAUSD policies when it comes to access and security. Last week, district officials did issue statements discouraging students from walking out during school hours. But there’s no explanation for why Lopez was fired, rather than being warned.\n\nParticularly angry are his students and some of the parents, who have been holding rallies outside the school.\n\nCommunity organizations like Unión del Barrio and the Association of Raza Educators are joining the efforts. A petition asking for Lopez’s reinstatement shows over 900 signatures. But so far, there’s no word from the school.\n\n\"I just want to get back to my classroom and students,\" explains Lopez, \"especially with the AP exams coming up soon.\"\n\nBut if the firing stands, especially with the reason Lopez says he was given — \"insubordination\" — he might have trouble renewing his teaching license in the future and teaching at any school.\n\n\"It’s wrong and not fair,\" says one student outside the school. Those we spoke to say he was not encouraging students to leave the school, and that they \"acted on their own.\" Many parents outside the school said off camera that while they really would prefer the students to not walk out, the punishment for the popular teacher seems excessive.\n\nSynergy Academies confirmed Lopez is no longer with the school. The school issued the following statement:\n\n\"Over the last few days, groups of students at Synergy Quantum Academy have been participating in student-led protests on campus. School administrators have been present throughout the day to supervise students and prioritize safety.\n\n\"We respect students’ rights to express themselves and understand that moments like these often reflect deeply held concerns. Our responsibility as a school is to ensure that student expression happens in a way that protects students’ safety and complies with established campus protocols.\n\n\"Synergy Quantum Academy is a public charter school co-located on a Los Angeles Unified School District campus. Synergy works collaboratively with our district partners to follow the campus access and safety procedures set by LAUSD policy to ensure the safety of students from both schools. Decisions about whether students may leave campus during the school day are made solely by school administration, according to campus safety protocols.\n\n\"Families continue to be notified, all students have been accounted for, and counselors and support staff have been available to students who wish to talk or need additional support.\n\n\"We appreciate the partnership of our families and community as we continue to support our students, uphold their rights, and maintain a safe and orderly learning environment.\"",

    "description": "Psychology says the way you process information can be explained by whether you shower in the morning or at night.",
    "fullText": "I've always been a night showerer. My husband thinks it's weird. \"How do you wake up without a shower?\" he asks every single morning while I'm already dressed and caffeinated before he's even opened his right eye.\n\nBut the idea of showering in the morning makes no sense to me. I need to wash off the day before I get into clean sheets. I need that end-of-day ritual to signal that work is over, the day is done, and I can finally relax.\n\nTo me, morning showers feel rushed. Utilitarian. Like you're just getting ready to face the world.\n\nBut night showers? Those are intentional. Reflective. A deliberate close to the day.\n\nAnd apparently, that preference says something about how my brain works. Because the choice to shower at night versus morning isn't just about hygiene or routine. It's about how you process information, manage transitions, and structure your mental life.\n\nHere's what showering at night reveals about how your brain operates.\n\nMorning showerers wake up and immediately start preparing for what's next. They're forward-focused. Already thinking about the day ahead.\n\nBut you can't do that. You need to close the previous chapter before you can open a new one.\n\nThe night shower is a closing ritual. It marks the end of the day. You're washing it off, literally and psychologically, so you can be done with it.\n\nResearch on cognitive closure found that people who require strong endpoint rituals before transitions process information more sequentially. They complete one task before moving to the next, rather than holding multiple open loops.\n\nYou probably do this with everything. You finish one project before starting another. You can't relax until your to-do list is done. You need clear endpoints, not ambiguity.\n\nWhen you're stressed, you probably have rituals that help you manage it. Things you do with your body to regulate your mind.\n\nThe night shower is one of them. It's not just about hygiene. It's about using the physical act of washing to process and release stress.\n\nStudies on somatic regulation found that people who rely on physical rituals to manage emotional states tend to be more body-aware and kinesthetic in how they process information. They need to do something physical to shift their mental state.\n\nYou probably can't just \"think\" your way out of stress. You need to move. To do something. To physically release it.\n\nMorning showerers can carry work stress into the evening, sleep with it, and deal with it tomorrow. They compartmentalize naturally.\n\nBut you can't. Work follows you home. The stress of the day lingers. You're still thinking about it hours later.\n\nAnd you need the shower to help you separate from it. To create a boundary between work and home, day and night.\n\nStudies on cognitive compartmentalization show that people who struggle with mental separation often rely on physical rituals to create boundaries. The ritual does what their brain can't do automatically.\n\nYou're not switching contexts easily. You're carrying everything with you until you deliberately release it.\n\nYour brain doesn't just move through the day collecting experiences. It needs to review them. Make sense of them. File them away properly.\n\nThe shower is when you do that. You're mentally reviewing the day. Processing what happened. Deciding what matters and what doesn't.\n\nOnly then can you release it and move on.\n\nResearch on memory consolidation found that people who engage in regular end-of-day reflection have better long-term memory for meaningful events. The review process helps them decide what's worth keeping.\n\nMorning showerers don't do this. They just accumulate and move forward. But you're curating. Reviewing. Deciding what stays and what goes.\n\nMorning showerers use the shower to wake up. To get energized. To prepare for interaction.\n\nBut you use it to think. Really think. Without anyone else around.\n\nYou need that solitude to process. To work through problems. To make sense of things without external input.\n\nYou're probably not someone who talks through problems. You need to sit with them first. Work through them internally. And the shower is where that happens.\n\nYou can feel the day on your body. The sweat. The grime. The weight of everything you did.\n\nAnd you need to wash it off before you can relax.\n\nMorning showerers don't notice that. Or if they do, it doesn't bother them. They can go to bed carrying the physical residue of the day.\n\nBut you're hyper-aware of it. You notice how your body feels. What it's carrying. What it needs.\n\nYou probably notice hunger, fatigue, and tension before other people do. Your body talks to you, and you listen.\n\nYour morning might be flexible. You can wake up at different times. Skip breakfast. Leave at different hours.\n\nBut your night? That has to be the same.\n\nSame shower time. Same routine. Same order of operations.\n\nBecause breaking that routine feels destabilizing. It throws off your entire ability to wind down.\n\nYou probably get genuinely stressed when you can't shower at your normal time. When something disrupts the routine. Because your brain is relying on that predictability to transition into rest.\n\nMorning showerers are top-down thinkers. They start with the big picture—what's the day about?—and work down to the details.\n\nBut you're bottom-up. You start with the specifics—what happened today?—and build up to understanding.\n\nThe night shower is when you do that building. You're reviewing the details of the day, the specific moments, and constructing meaning from them.\n\nResearch on information processing styles found that bottom-up processors need more time for reflection and synthesis. They can't form conclusions until they've reviewed all the data.\n\nYou need time to gather information and the shower is the perfect place to do it.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Katie Bloomfield. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nA lot of people tell me they could never work with their spouse. But I didn't find Danny, my husband, until I was in my 30s, and once I did, I wanted to spend as much time with him as I could — to catch up on the years we hadn't known each other.\n\nWe met in 2017 and married two years later. Between us, we had five children. I was working in hotel management and helping a friend build her own business, while Danny had been running his own business for years.\n\nAfter we started investing in property and found our strengths complemented each other, I suggested we try running a property management company together. Six years later, we now own £10 million ($13.6 million) worth of property.\n\nWhile I wouldn't suggest to everyone that they should start a company with their partner, the setup has worked really well for us because we've put practices in place to protect our relationship.\n\nWe live in a no-blame culture — both in work and at home. Blame builds resentment. I've seen this a number of times when couples are in business together, and it doesn't end well.\n\nWhen one of us has done something wrong, we don't blame each other; we never make it public, but instead coach each other in private.\n\nInstead of finding fault with each other when something goes wrong, we look at what needs to happen now. What is the next step to take responsibility?\n\nEarly on, we decided that if we were going to go into business together, it was our responsibility to keep our relationship strong and healthy.\n\nIf our relationship broke down, so would the family lives of our kids and our business.\n\nOne very practical way we have done this is by sticking to the 777 rule. Every seven days, we go on a simple date — it might be just a walk or a coffee. Every seven weeks, we may have a bigger, longer date, and every seven months, we take a short holiday, just the two of us.\n\nWe also keep the romance alive — making sure we consistently have sex, making it a goal to be intimate with each other at least 86 times a year, a figure based on a statistic about how much sex healthy couples have. We've both got tattoos that read \"~86\" — just to remind us of how important physical intimacy is.\n\nEvery Sunday, we sit down as a family and make a plan for the week. It's here we make space for work, family, and couple time. Every single thing is on the family calendar.\n\nWe make every effort not to talk about work outside our working hours. If Danny attempts to show me a spreadsheet at 11 p.m., I'll ask him why he is showing me — it isn't work time. Family vacations are, for the most part, work-free.\n\nOccasionally, we don't have a choice — we'll have to work unexpectedly. When this happens, we don't try to multitask family and work. We build in the time we need to work, and get it done during that timeframe.\n\nYou may think that, as joint-business founders, we'd spend all our time together, but we actually work several times apart each week, as our working styles are different.\n\nDanny likes working from coffee shops, whereas I need a quiet space — usually at home. We divide and conquer tasks — often taking meetings separately.\n\nHowever, we really enjoy each other's company — we're obsessed with each other — so we love working together too.\n\nIt's imperative that we communicate clearly with each other, never assuming we know what the other person is thinking.\n\nIt becomes passive-aggressive and can be harmful to the relationship, which, in turn, is harmful to business. Both of us are honest, even blunt, with each other, but always in a kind way, and always in private.\n\nThe reason working together as a couple has worked is because we have put considerable energy into our relationship and ourselves.\n\nWe've both been prepared to hold up a mirror to ourselves, asking what we might need to change, and we've prioritized stretching our relationship.\n\nI wouldn't have gone into business with just anyone, but it works really well with Danny.",

    "fullText": "He worked in Big Tech. Now, he fears half of its software engineers are on the chopping block.\n\nSteve Yegge worked with Jeff Bezos in Amazon's early years. Then he went to Google, where he worked for over 12 years and earned the title of senior staff software engineer. He also knows a thing or two about AI engineering, having written a book on the topic titled \"Vibe Coding.\"\n\nOn \"The Pragmatic Engineer\" podcast and newsletter, Yegge described an imaginary dial of the percentage of engineering staff a company can lay off, ranging from zero to 100. He said he believes the dial is being set at 50 in the age of AI.\n\n\"You're going to have to get rid of half of them to make the other half maximally productive,\" Yegge said. \"We're going to lose around half the engineers from big companies, which is scary\".\n\nThere's a capital-to-labor tradeoff happening in tech. Companies are paying vast sums for tokens and enterprise AI licenses, GPUs, and computing capacity. That money needs to come from somewhere — and for some, it could come from labor costs.\n\nYegge pointed to this tradeoff as the reason for his forecast of 50% cuts becoming the norm. Companies will lay off some engineers to help pay for the others to have adequate access to AI, he said.\n\nHost Gergely Orosz said that 50% cuts would be more than during the COVID-19 pandemic, when tech went through an intense layoff cycle.\n\n\"It's going to be way bigger,\" Yegge said. \"It's going to be awful.\"\n\nThey aren't the only ones referencing the pandemic. In a popular X article, HyperWrite CEO Matt Shumer wrote that AI's impact on work would be \"much, much bigger than Covid.\"\n\nIn recent years, the question of AI-driven layoffs has haunted workers at Big Tech companies, many of which went on a hiring spree during the pandemic. While it's often impossible to boil job loss down a single reason, many suspect productivity gains from AI and ballooning capex spending are fueling the cuts. Some business leaders have also explicitly cited AI when announcing layoffs.\n\nMeanwhile, tech leaders describe smaller teams working more efficiently. On a recent earnings call, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said one engineer could now do the work of a whole team, thanks to AI.\n\nAs AI productivity grows, so have complaints of AI fatigue. Software engineer Siddhant Khare penned a lengthy essay about growing more productive, but also feeling more drained than ever. He told Business Insider that he felt like a \"reviewer\" as opposed to an engineer.\n\nYegge said it's not all bad news for the engineers — just those who want to work at a big company. Engineers who have \"seen the light\" are now getting together, leaving their companies, and creating startups that outpace the industry's giants, he said.\n\n\"We've got this mad rush of innovation coming up, bottom up,\" he said. \"And we've got knowledge workers being laid off by big companies because clearly big businesses are not the right size anymore.\"",

    "title": "AI CEO warns AI's disruption will be 'much bigger' than COVID: 'The people I care about deserve to hear what is coming'",
    "description": "Hyperwrite CEO Matt Shumer wrote that people in tech \"aren't making predictions. We're telling you what already occurred in our jobs.\"",
    "fullText": "It's never a good sign when a CEO warns something more disruptive than COVID is heading our way.\n\nIn an essay titled \"Something Big Is Happening,\" Hyperwrite CEO Matt Shumer said AI can now do all of his technical work — and he thinks your job could be next.\n\n\"I'm writing this for the people in my life who don't... my family, my friends, the people I care about who keep asking me 'so what's the deal with AI?' and getting an answer that doesn't do justice to what's actually happening,\" Shumer wrote in his nearly 5,000-word post published Tuesday on X.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, his post had 40 million views and 18,000 retweets. Shumer is a cofounder of OthersideAI, which features Hyperwrite, an AI-assisted writing tool.\n\nShumer said that the reason people in tech \"are sounding the alarm\" is that they have already experienced what's coming for everyone else.\n\n\"We're not making predictions,\" he wrote. \"We're telling you what already occurred in our own jobs, and warning you that you're next.\"\n\nShumer said that many people outside tech wrote off AI years ago after a clunky experience with an early edition of ChatGPT.\n\n\"The models available today are unrecognizable from what existed even six months ago,\" he wrote. \"The debate about whether AI is 'really getting better' or 'hitting a wall' — which has been going on for over a year — is over.\"\n\nIt's not the time to panic, Shumer said. Instead, the best thing to do is to become deeply familiar with AI. \"This might be the most important year of your career,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I don't say that to stress you out. I say it because right now, there is a brief window where most people at most companies are still ignoring this,\" he wrote. \"The person who walks into a meeting and says 'I used AI to do this analysis in an hour instead of three days' is going to be the most valuable person in the room.\"\n\nHe's far from alone in sounding the alarm. Despite disagreement from other tech leaders, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei remains adamant that AI could wipe out up to half of white collar, entry-level jobs in the next one to five years.\n\nxAI CEO Elon Musk and others have warned that if your job doesn't involve physical labor, it's likely to be replaced by AI much more quickly, a view that dovetails with a growing base of economic research.\n\nShumer's essay struck a chord, especially with those in tech. Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian replied, \"Great writeup. Strongly agree.\"\n\n\"Great advice for how to get ahead in your job at any large company right now,\" A16z general partner David Haber wrote.\n\nGreat advice for how to get ahead in your job at any large company right now.\n\n“I used AI to do this analysis in an hour instead of three days\" is going to be the most valuable person in the room. Not eventually. Right now. Learn these tools. Get proficient. Demonstrate what's… https://t.co/cBq5s1AH4Y\n\nWhile the response to the post has been overwhelmingly positive, some X users pointed out the limitations still present in many current AI products, like hallucinations and general inaccuracies.\n\nShumer said that this moment feels like February 2020, when in a short span of time, news of a spreading pandemic gave way to a worldwide upheaval unseen in modern times that continues to reverberate to this day.\n\nThe potential of what AI will change, he wrote, is \"much bigger than Covid.\"\n\nFor Shumer, this moment of realization came with the recent dueling releases of Anthropic's Opus 4.6 and OpenAI's GPT-5.3 Codex. Both models are primarily aimed at software engineering. OpenAI said in its release notes that GPT-5.3 Codex \"is our first model that was instrumental in creating itself.\"\n\n\"It wasn't just executing my instructions,\" Shumer wrote of his experience with OpenAI's latest Codex model. \"It was making intelligent decisions. It had something that felt, for the first time, like judgment. Like taste. The inexplicable sense of knowing what the right call is that people always said AI would never have.\"\n\nAI is now so intelligent, Shumer said, that he can tell the agent what he wants and \"walk away from my computer for four hours, and come back to find the work done. Done well.\"\n\nIn a post on LinkedIn Wednesday morning, Shumer addressed his viral X post.\n\n\"Every time someone asks me what's going on with AI, I give them the safe answer,\" he wrote on Wednesday. \"Because the real one sounds insane. I'm done doing that.\"",

    "fullText": "Threads, Meta's X-like social network, rolled out a feature that lets users tell the app's algorithm what they want to see more or less of in their feed.\n\nThe feature, called Dear Algo, works like this: you write a public Threads post starting with \"Dear Algo,\" followed by a request, such as asking to see less about a TV show you're not caught up on yet, for instance, or more about your favorite basketball team during a live game. The algorithm then adjusts your feed for three days based on what you asked for, and you can delete that request if you want. You can also repost someone else's Dear Algo request to try out their preferences.\n\n\"We think we can do a better job by going deep with individuals on what they want to see more and less of,\" said Connor Hayes, Meta's head of Threads.\n\nIn a blog post about the announcement, Meta described Dear Algo as \"an AI-powered feature that gives you more control over what you see by letting you tell Threads what's important to you in the moment.\"\n\nHayes also said that Threads will reject queries that don't meet Meta's recommendation guidelines or content principles.\n\nThreads teased the feature back in December, framing it as a response to a trend Meta had noticed: people were already posting to ask their algorithms to change what showed up in their feeds.\n\nFor years, people have blamed algorithmic timelines for pulling users into echo chambers, rewarding rage bait over substance, and turning a quick scroll into doomscrolling. Dear Algo could give users back some agency.\n\n\"The best algorithms are personalized,\" Hayes said, adding that what works for one user won't work \"at scale.\"\n\nDear Algo arrives at an interesting moment for Threads. The app now has more than 400 million monthly active users, and on its latest earnings call, Meta said time spent on it jumped 20% in the fourth quarter of 2025. A recent report from analytics firm Similarweb found that Threads had edged out X in daily mobile usage. And in January, Meta started running ads, a sign it sees Threads as a real business.\n\nThe feature also provides a glimpse into the company's broader AI ambitions. On Meta's latest earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Meta is working on merging large language models with the recommendation systems that power Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and its ad system.\n\nThe company's recommendation systems are \"already driving meaningful growth,\" Zuckerberg said on the call. He added that \"the current systems are primitive compared to what will be possible soon.\"\n\nHave a tip? Contact Pranav Dixit via email at pranavdixit@protonmail.com or Signal at 1-408-905-9124.

    "title": "Ford CEO says 'the customer has spoken' after its EV business lost nearly $5 billion last year",
    "description": "Ford once predicted it would sell 150,000 electric pickups each year. Instead, it recorded another multi-billion-dollar loss in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Ford's electric vehicle business lost nearly $5 billion last year — and CEO Jim Farley says the company got the message.\n\n\"So I think the customer has spoken. That's the punchline,\" he said during Tuesday's earnings call.\n\nFord's EV unit posted a $4.8 billion loss in 2025, as sales of its Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning, and E-Transit fell 14% from a year earlier.\n\nNow, the automaker is reshaping its electric strategy — shifting toward lower-cost, high-volume EVs and leaning harder into hybrids. It's a reversal of Ford's early strategy of electrifying its most iconic, priciest vehicles first, betting that brand loyalty and subsidies would offset sticker shock.\n\nFord was one of the earliest legacy American automakers to directly challenge Tesla with mass-market EVs.\n\nThe Mustang Mach-E arrived in December 2020 as a rival to the Tesla Model Y. In mid-2022, Ford launched the F-150 Lightning.\n\nOn paper, the bet was simple: electrify the century-old carmaker's two most iconic nameplates to leapfrog EV startups.\n\nEarly enthusiasm was strong. Ford said it received nearly 200,000 reservations for the Lightning and projected annual sales of 150,000 units.\n\nThat early momentum faded — and never materialized into the high-volume sales Ford was hoping for.\n\nIn 2025, Ford sold 27,307 F-150 Lightnings — down 18.5% from 2024 — and 51,620 Mustang Mach-Es, roughly flat year over year.\n\nSales figures were even more stark after the $7,500 federal tax credit ended last September. The F-150 Lightning's estimated sales dropped from 5,197 units in December 2024 to just 1,724 a year later, according to Ford Authority.\n\nMeanwhile, US EV sales declined while hybrid demand climbed. For example, Ford sold 84,934 hybrid F-150s last year, a 15% increase.\n\nSo, the company is switching up its plans.\n\nThe company has since ended production of its all-electric F-150 Lightning. It will return at an undisclosed time as an extended-range electric vehicle, or EREV — a battery-powered truck with a gas generator onboard.\n\nFord expects the new model will have improved range and increased towing capacity, both of which were concerns for early F-150 Lightning adopters.\n\n\"We're betting on hybrid across our lineup, and EREV where it makes sense,\" Farley said during the call. \"Like a large truck, where towing is a really important application, and both PHEV (plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles) and pure electric will definitely not work.\"\n\nAt the same time, Ford is developing a new \"universal\" EV platform designed for lower-cost, high-volume vehicles.\n\nThe first model — a roughly $30,000 midsize pickup — is expected in 2027. Ford plans to build at least five vehicles off the platform, potentially including SUVs and commercial vans.\n\n\"We aren't just building compliance vehicles at Ford. We're launching a cost-efficient, universal EV platform that will drive profitable growth,\" Farley added. \"Tesla's shown that they could, we can make money in that market, even without subsidy from the government at the right cost level.\"\n\nIt follows a trend in the auto industry. Other major automakers — including Toyota, Subaru, Rivian, Nissan, and Chevrolet — are planning launches for sub-$50,000 EVs this year.\n\nStill, Ford expects its EV business to remain in the red for several more years. CFO Sherry House said the company is targeting break-even for the segment around 2029.\n\nInvestors have taken a cautious view of the company's long-term financial health. Ford missed earnings estimates for the quarter, reporting 13 cents adjusted estimated earnings per share versus analysts' estimates of 19 cents.\n\n\"On paper, it's a big miss, but I don't think it's a big deal,\" John Rosevear, a contributing analyst at The Motley Fool, told Business Insider. \"Ford's guidance for 2026 anticipates nice year-over-year increases in cash flow, as well as higher capital expenditures — all stuff that the market will almost certainly like.\"",

    "description": "James Van Der Beek opened up about the unexpected sign of colorectal cancer he hoped others might get screened before his death. Here’s the symptom he missed.",
    "fullText": "Nearly two years after being diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal cancer, James Van Der Beek has died at the age of 48. The Varisty Blues star died peacefully in his home, according to a post his wife, Kimberly Van Der Beek, made on Instagram. Prior to his death, the Dawson’s Creek actor spoke out about the colorectal cancer symptom he said he ignored.\n\nThe star first opened up about his diagnosis in November 2024. In the months following, he was a vocal advocate for others to get tested for colorectal cancer in their 40s, even if otherwise healthy.\n\n“I was healthy. I was doing the cold plunge. I was in amazing cardiovascular shape, and I had stage 3 cancer, and I had no idea,” he told Healthline the year following his diagnosis.\n\nIt was minor changes in his bowel movements that clued Van Der Beek in to the idea that something might be going on. He previously told PEOPLE that he thought the changes might be related to putting cream in his coffee or drinking too much coffee altogether.\n\n“But when I cut that out, and it didn’t improve, I thought, ‘All right, I better get this checked out,’” he recalled.\n\nColorectal cancer, which is a cancer that initially affects the large intestine, doesn’t always cause symptoms in its early stages. Because of this, it’s often caught after it’s already begun to spread; in 2019, 60% of diagnoses were for advanced-stage colorectal cancer.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute reports that rectal bleeding and diarrhea are two of the most common early symptoms of colorectal cancer in people under the age of 50, along with abdominal pain and iron deficiency anemia.\n\nOther changes in bowel habits, such as constipation, may also be a symptom, as can weakness or tiredness and unexplained weight loss, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nDue to an increase in colorectal cancer among young people, the American Cancer Society has started recommending that people begin to get tested regularly at age 45, rather than the previously recommended age of 50. They also note that anyone who might be at higher risk should consider even earlier screenings.\n\nIncreased risk factors include (but are not limited to):\n\nA close relative who has been diagnosed with colorectal cancer\n\nDiets that are high in red meat or low in vitamin D\n\n“It is the second leading cause of cancer death, but if you look closer, it’s also the most curable,” Van Der Beek told Healthline. “I really want people to understand that [when found] in the early stages, the survival rates skyrocket.”\n\nOur thoughts are with Van Der Beek’s family at this time.\n\nCan Apple Cider Vinegar Lead to Weight Loss?\n\nBobbi Brown Shares Her Top Face-Transforming Makeup Tips for Women Over 50",

    "title": "Death isn't the end: Meta patented an AI that lets you keep posting from beyond the grave",
    "description": "Meta was recently granted a patent for tech to keep your social media accounts running using AI if you take a break or die.",
    "fullText": "Does Meta want to make our social media accounts immortal?\n\nThe company was granted a patent in late December that outlines how a large language model can \"simulate\" a person's social media activity, such as responding to content posted by real people.\n\n\"The language model may be used for simulating the user when the user is absent from the social networking system, for example, when the user takes a long break or if the user is deceased,\" the patent says.\n\nAndrew Bosworth, Meta's CTO, is listed as the primary author of the patent, which was first filed in 2023.\n\n\"We have no plans to move forward with this example,\" a spokesperson for Meta told Business Insider.\n\nIn the patent, Meta lays out why it thinks people might need this.\n\nIf you're no longer posting online — whether that's because you need a break from social media or … you … die — your followers' user experience will be affected. In short, they'll miss you.\n\n\"The impact on the users is much more severe and permanent if that user is deceased and can never return to the social networking platform,\" the document says.\n\nTo fill that void, Meta would essentially create a digital clone of your social media presence, training a model on \"user-specific\" data — including historical platform activity, such as comments, likes, or content — to understand how you would (or rather, did) behave.\n\nThat clone can then respond to other people's content by liking and commenting, or responding to DMs. For influencers or creators who make their livelihoods on Meta's platforms and need to take a break from social media, such a tool could be useful.\n\nMeta's patent also references tech that would allow the LLM to simulate video or audio calls with users.\n\nThe Meta spokesperson said that while it files patents to disclose concepts, a granted patent does not always mean the company will pursue, develop, or implement that tech.\n\nStill, it opens up many questions about the nature of tech — and grief. An AI bot that acts as your understudy while you're on a digital detox is one thing, but imitating people who've died?\n\nEdina Harbinja, a UK-based professor at the University of Birmingham's Law School, has concerns.\n\n\"It does affect not just legal issues, but a lot of very important social, ethical, and deeply philosophical issues as well,\" Harbinja, who specializes in digital rights and post-mortem privacy, told Business Insider.\n\nMeta has thought about managing digital legacies for years.\n\nAbout a decade ago, Facebook launched tools that let people designate a \"legacy contact\" to manage their accounts if they died. And back in the company's metaverse days, in a 2023 interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, Mark Zuckerberg discussed virtual avatars for deceased people.\n\n\"If someone has lost a loved one and is grieving, there may be ways in which being able to interact or relive certain memories could be helpful,\" Zuckerberg said at the time.\n\nThere are a lot of names for this broader category of tech — death bots, ghost bots, grief tech — that are aiming to help people face the loss of loved ones with eternally memorialized digital versions of them.\n\nSeveral startups have launched around this premise, and many have emerged from founders' own experiences with grief. Replika, an AI chatbot startup, was founded in 2015 by Eugenia Kuyda after the loss of her friend. Then there's You, Only Virtual (YOV), which was founded in 2020 by Justin Harrison when his mother was diagnosed with cancer.\n\n\"Everybody in the tech world has been thinking about this for a while, as soon as we started having breaks in generative AI,\" Harrison said.\n\nIn 2021, Microsoft patented an AI chatbot that could simulate a deceased person (as well as fictional characters or celebrities).\n\nMeta's patent signals that the technology category is moving more into the mainstream, Harbinja said.\n\nHarrison isn't surprised to see bigger tech companies dipping their toes in the space, and sees it as a sign that people are beginning to \"feel more comfortable with doing this.\"\n\n\"We can only improve on what we offer people,\" Harrison said, adding that the resources for grieving are \"horrible\" to begin with.\n\n\"I think we have a moral obligation, if we have the potential, to do more for those folks than we should be,\" he said.\n\nAI, death, and grief are not easy topics to digest, however. The intersection of all three is a potent brew of taboos ripe for a philosophical debate on ethics, digital rights, and privacy for any dinner table.\n\nMeta has more than helping people process grief as an incentive to pursue the tech it lays out in its patent, especially for accounts taking a break.\n\n\"It's more engagement, more content, more data — more data for the current and the future AI,\" Harbinja said. \"I can see the business incentive for that. I'm just curious to see how they would, when, and if they will implement this innovation.\"\n\nDepending on how a product like this is rolled out, different questions could come up.\n\nFor instance, would this apply across all of Meta's apps? Would it understand the nuance of your WhatsApp presence vs. the candor you have in the Instagram comment section?\n\nJoseph Davis, a sociology professor at the University of Virginia, said he was concerned with the impact that tools like a Meta bot could have on how humans experience grief.\n\n\"One of the tasks of grief is to face the actual loss,\" Davis said.\n\n\"Let the dead be dead,\" Davis added. \"The idea of bringing them back, but you're not really doing that, but in fact, it looks like that. That's the confusion.\"\n\nHave a tip? Contact this reporter via email at sbradley@businessinsider.com or Signal at sydneykbradley.123.

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kiva Lucero, 21, who is from El Paso and studies in New York City. He is the cofounder of a Paris-based creative collective. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was scrolling on Instagram on Tuesday when I saw the El Paso airspace was closing for 10 days. Immediately, I was stressed and anxious.\n\nI had a flight booked from El Paso to Dallas for Thursday, and then Dallas to Paris, and had to get to Paris by the weekend for work.\n\nWhen I found out that what was supposed to be a 10-day closure lasted seven hours, I didn't feel much relief — I had canceled my flight to Dallas and spent nearly $100 on a bus that I haven't been able to get refunded.\n\nWhen I first found out about the airspace closure at around midnight on Tuesday, I called my airline immediately and explained the situation. I kind of freaked out.\n\nI asked them if it was possible for me to cancel the El Paso to Dallas leg of my flight, and I would just figure out a way to get to Dallas.\n\nThey canceled my flight after a lot of hard negotiation. At three o'clock in the morning, I booked a ticket for a 12-hour bus ride from El Paso to Dallas, leaving at 7 p.m. on Wednesday and getting to Dallas 6:30 a.m. Thursday.\n\nI didn't even know if I was going to make it to the bus. I was thinking El Paso could get completely locked down. I was up all night.\n\nI just didn't expect anything good to come of the situation. I thought it could be a serious evacuation. I called my mom to make sure everything was good, because I didn't want her staying in town if there was a major issue.\n\nWhen I saw on the New York Times in the morning that the closure was lifted, I still couldn't sleep.\n\nI called the airline again to reinstate my original booking, because I didn't want to take a 12 hour bus. Luckily, they did.\n\nBut it was hours of just stress and anxiety and feeling so helpless.\n\nI had already canceled plans with friends and work meetings because I thought I would be on the bus the next day.\n\nThankfully, I should make it to Paris now, but it cost me $100 and a full night of sleep.\n\nA Trump administration official told Business Insider of the disruption: \"Mexican cartel drones breached US airspace\" and the Defense Department \"took action to disable the drones,\" and there was no threat to commercial travel.",

His wife, Kimberly, shared the news on her Instagram.\n\n\"Our beloved James David Van Der Beek passed peacefully this morning,\" she wrote alongside a photo of her husband. \"He met his final days with courage, faith, and grace. There is much to share regarding his wishes, love for humanity and the sacredness of time. Those days will come. For now we ask for peaceful privacy as we grieve our loving husband, father, son, brother, and friend.\"\n\nVan Der Beek learned he had stage 3 colon cancer in 2023, and publicly announced his diagnosis in late 2024.\n\nVan Der Beek previously spoke with Business Insider as part of our ongoing series on cancer in younger people. Van Der Beek told Business Insider that the news came as a shock, given the subtleness of his symptoms and his efforts to stay as healthy as possible.\n\n\"I was doing everything,\" he said. \"I was doing sauna, cold plunge, weightlifting, Pilates. I would dance and also do football training.\"\n\nVan Der Beek found instant fame when he was cast as the titular teen Dawson Leery in The WB series \"Dawson's Creek.\" The show ran for six seasons from 1998 to 2002.\n\nWhile on the show, Van Der Beek cemented his 1990s stardom by landing the lead role in the 1999 coming-of-age drama \"Varsity Blues,\" playing Texas high school quarterback \"Mox\" Moxon.\n\nVan Der Beek worked steadily the rest of his career, starring in the cult indie hit \"The Rules of Attraction,\" playing a fictional version of himself on the series \"Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23,\" and performing on \"Dancing with the Stars\" in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, Van Der Beek moved with his family from Los Angeles to Texas to focus on raising their children. His wife, Kimberly, gave birth to their sixth child in 2021.\n\nVan Der Beek said he struggled to process the news of his 2023 diagnosis and cope with his new reality.\n\n\"All these beautiful things that I love, and I used to define myself as — a father, a provider, a husband — all that got taken away, or at least paused,\" he previously told Business Insider. \"I had to sit there and say, 'Well, what am I?' And it was, 'I'm still worthy of love.'\"\n\nTo support Van Der Beek, his former \"Dawson's Creek\" castmates — including Michelle Williams, Katie Holmes, Joshua Jackson, and Busy Philipps — organized a one-night-only live reading of the show's pilot episode in 2025. Held in New York City, the event raised money for F Cancer, a nonprofit focused on early screening and cancer prevention.\n\nOriginally scheduled to perform, Van Der Beek announced that he had two stomach viruses and said he was disappointed he couldn't attend. Lin-Manuel Miranda took on the role of Dawson instead.",

    "description": "Moody's economist Mark Zandi doubts job growth will continue despite a strong January jobs report, due to healthcare reliance and AI risks.",
    "fullText": "The Bureau of Labor Statistics released a delayed January jobs report on Wednesday, beating economists expectations and showing the US economy added 130,000 jobs in the first month of 2026.\n\nMark Zandi says don't get comfortable with the upbeat data.\n\nThe figure is substantially higher than the 75,000 jobs that economists anticipated, but the Moody's Analytics economist isn't optimistic that the growth will continue.\n\nZandi has repeatedly warned that the US economy is on shaky ground, and could tumble into a recession. In a post on X on Wednesday, he said that the latest jobs data didn't do anything to ease his concerns.\n\n\"The job market remains fragile and highly vulnerable,\" he said. \"Yes, payroll employment increased by 130,000 in January, but given the big downward revisions to history, there has been no job growth since last April (Liberation Day).\"\n\nZandi also highlighted that almost all the January jobs growth came from the healthcare industry, something he doesn't think bodes well for the broader US economy.\n\n\"Without healthcare, the economy would be losing lots of jobs and unemployment headed higher,\" he told Business Insider. \"There are good reasons why healthcare is adding jobs, but it shows how vulnerable the job market and economy are if healthcare stumbled or even slowed its hiring.\"\n\nThat's not his only concern. Zandi also warned that a fragile labor market could be further compromised by the impact of AI, something he thinks is approaching quickly. While AI hasn't yet appeared in macro data, Zandi maintains that it is likely to change in the near future.\n\nThe economist added that he thinks rising layoffs will be the clearest indication that the labor market is starting to crack. Companies such as Amazon, Meta, and Pinterest have announced steep job cuts recently, and layoffs throughout the economy touched the highest level since 2009 last month.\n\n\"The best real-time measure of layoffs is weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance,\" Zandi added. \"They are running close to 225k per week, which is low. If they rise above 250k on a consistent basis, the job market is in trouble.\"",

    "fullText": "For over a week, the disappearance of NBC host Savannah Guthrie's mother has gripped her Tucson community and drawn nationwide attention.\n\nNancy Guthrie was reported missing on February 1 after failing to show up for church services.\n\nIn the days since, local authorities and the FBI have launched an expansive multi-agency investigation for the \"Today\" co-anchor's mother.\n\nSavannah Guthrie has described her mother as the \"rock\" who held her family together after her father's death when she was a teenager, and has credited Nancy as a major influence in her life, even encouraging her to pursue a career in journalism.\n\nHere's a closer look at the life of the 84-year-old mother of three.\n\nNancy Guthrie (née Long) grew up in Fort Wright, Kentucky, a small Cincinnati suburb.\n\nShe attended Catholic, all-girls elementary and high schools, and went on to enroll at the University of Kentucky.\n\nWhile there, she worked with the student-run newspaper, the Kentucky Kernel, as a society editor and staff member. She covered Greek life for the publication, her former editor told local Kentucky outlet WKYT.\n\nThe couple were living in Melbourne, Australia — where they had moved for Charles' work — when their youngest child, Savannah, was born in 1971.\n\nSavannah Guthrie has often spoken about growing up in a tight-knit family where faith played a central role.\n\nHer family spent every Sunday at the local Baptist church for Sunday school, morning service, choir practice, and night service.\n\n\"We liked to say that God was the sixth member of the Guthrie family,\" she wrote in a blog post.\n\nThe family moved back to Arizona when Savannah was 2 years old, and her mother has lived in the area since.\n\nWhen Savannah was 16, Charles Guthrie died of a heart attack while working in Mexico.\n\nAfter her husband's death, Nancy Guthrie stepped up as the \"rock\" who held the family together, her daughter has said.\n\nNancy Guthrie returned to work so her children could attend college, taking a public relations job at the University of Arizona so Savannah and Annie could attend tuition-free, the anchor told The Hollywood Reporter in 2016.\n\nUntil then, Nancy Guthrie had raised the family full-time.\n\nIt was Nancy who encouraged her daughter to study journalism in college, which was the beginning of Savannah Guthrie's career.\n\nIn 1993, Savannah Guthrie earned a degree in journalism from the University of Arizona, graduating cum laude.\n\nAfter earning a law degree, she returned to journalism, eventually becoming a co-anchor on \"Today\" in 2012.\n\nWhile Nancy Guthrie has largely maintained a private life, she has occasionally stepped into the spotlight in support of her daughter, appearing publicly with her, including on the \"Today\" show.\n\nThe appearances offered viewers a rare glimpse of the family behind the longtime morning show anchor.\n\nFriends and members of her Tucson community have described her as a consistent presence, including through her church involvement.\n\nFormer actor and KVOA reporter Sally Shamrell said the Guthries \"are a very revered family in Tucson,\" as reported by CBS News.\n\nOn February 1, Nancy Guthrie was reported missing from her Tucson, Arizona, home after failing to show up for church services at a family member's home.\n\nThe Pima County Sheriff's Department and the FBI immediately began a multi-agency search for the 84-year-old, treating the disappearance as a criminal case after finding evidence at her residence that they said suggested foul play.\n\nOn Wednesday, February 4, Savannah and her two siblings released a video on social media pleading with Nancy's potential kidnappers and asking for proof of life and information about her well-being.\n\n\"She is 84 years old. Her health, her heart is fragile,\" Savannah Guthrie read in the video. \"She lives in constant pain. She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive. She needs it not to suffer.\"\n\n\"The FBI is doing everything in our power to bring Nancy Guthrie home to her family,\" said Jon Edwards, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's office in Tucson, at a press conference on Tuesday, February 5.\n\nOn Tuesday, February 10, the FBI released recovered security camera footage showing a masked figure who appeared to be tampering with a doorbell camera outside Nancy Guthrie's home.",

As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve just like any living organism,\" Musk wrote on X. \"This unfortunately required parting ways with some people. We wish them well in future endeavors.\"\n\nMusk outlined the changes shortly after xAI cofounders Tony Wu and Jimmy Ba announced they had left the company. Over the last few days, several other staffers posted on social media that they had also exited.\n\nOver the past few months, Musk expressed displeasure with the progress on Grok Imagine and Macrohard, people with knowledge of the issue told Business Insider.\n\nXAI recently cut a handful of workers who were involved with Macrohard, insiders said.\n\nSome additional staffers had their roles eliminated a few weeks ago, around the same time that Musk reorganized some teams between Wu and xAI cofounder Guodong Zhang, people with knowledge of the move said.\n\nA spokesperson for xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe restructuring announcement comes a little over a week after SpaceX acquired xAI. The combined company is gearing up for an initial public offering this year, according to an internal Q&A on the acquisition shared with xAI staff last week.\n\nWatch the all-hands meeting below:\n\nSince xAI was formed just 30 months ago, the small and talented team has made remarkable progress.\n\nThe future has never looked more exciting! pic.twitter.com/QZ73H2mpBj\n\nDo you work for xAI or have a tip?

    "fullText": "When Pete Srodoski meets with a new executive coaching client these days, he can do more in-depth work more quickly, thanks to ChatGPT.\n\nSrodoski, who founded the coaching firm Roll With the Punches in 2021, used to spend hours with clients discussing what should be included in strategic documents. Now, he uses ChatGPT to draft those documents alongside his clients in about 10 minutes.\n\nWith AI handling the initial framework, Srodoski and his clients can jump right into fine-tuning strategic plans and key job descriptions.\n\n\"That allows us to go deeper, go further, actually take those plans and make actionable items,\" he tells Business Insider.\n\nSrodoski is one of three solopreneurs who spoke with Business Insider about how they're using AI to streamline mundane decision-making — like writing initial drafts, formatting emails, or editing social media posts. The time and mental energy saved allows them to focus on the most critical decisions for their businesses and their clients, they say.\n\n\"We want to make the most impact for our time,\" Srodoski says — and AI can help.\n\nGeorgia Fort, founder of Stories by Georgia Fort, is an independent journalist in Minnesota who started using AI about 18 months ago. She uses ChatGPT to format her newsletters and social media posts, and OpusClip to edit videos for social media.\n\nShe estimates that using those services has freed five to ten hours in her workweek — time that she can now apply to the in-depth reporting she's known for.\n\nUltimately, \"the biggest impact is increased output,\" Fort says. With AI assistance, she's able to post more content on social media and release newsletters regularly, something she struggled with in the past.\n\nAn added bonus, she says, is that utilizing AI makes it just a bit easier to find the work-life balance that many solopreneurs struggle with.\n\n\"If nothing else, it's a meal I get to sit down and have with my kids,\" Fort says.\n\nDusti Arab, owner of The Reinvention Co., a boutique marketing firm, says AI is integrated into nearly every aspect of her workday. Because of that, \"I don't think I've put up so much high-quality content, ever,\" she says.\n\nFor Arab, who has ADHD, managing the constant decisions that a solopreneur must make was draining. She would often worry about missing a small detail, which distracted her from higher-level thinking.\n\nNow, she uses Wispr Flow to take voice notes throughout the day on topics like client communications and content ideas. Then, she imports those into Notion AI, which combines access to Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT to help her turn her notes into briefs.\n\n\"If you use AI to process the brain dump first, the deliverable comes out way better,\" Arab says.\n\nHer efforts with AI and being vocal about how she uses it are also paying off in a different way — clients now reach out to her specifically for advice on how to use it. She often guides them in using AI to delegate more effectively.\n\n\"Once the raw notes exist, you can use AI to turn the brain dump into a clear brief, a task list, and a handoff that someone else can actually execute,\" she says.\n\nLike Arab, Srodoski is often the one to introduce his clients to AI, specifically ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity, the platforms he uses. Often, the response is \"awe,\" he says.\n\nLast week, for example, a client shared that the time involved with pricing jobs had become a major roadblock in his business. Using ChatGPT, Srodoski guided him in creating a price book based on the previous three years' sales data.\n\n\"He was smiling ear to ear, saying that this would have cost him a few thousand dollars and a few weeks of labor time to get this pulled off,\" Srodoski says.\n\nWhile clients are often enthusiastic about AI, part of Srodoski's coaching is now emphasizing the decisions that leaders shouldn't outsource to AI.\n\nRecently, he had a client who wanted to confront an underperforming vendor. The client was planning to draft an email using ChatGPT, but Srodoski stopped him.\n\n\"Get on the phone. See how they respond,\" he recalls saying. During the phone call, Srodoski's client was able to explain himself, empathize with the vendor, clarify a misunderstanding, and create a solution.\n\n\"That's a leadership decision you can't do with ChatGPT,\" Srodoski says.",

    "fullText": "Adam Mosseri's multimillion-dollar pay package took center stage on Wednesday as lawyers sought to link Meta's profits to platforms that addict children.\n\nAs the first of several tech executives to testify in a social media addiction trial playing out in Los Angeles state court, the head of Instagram said he is paid roughly $900,000 a year and receives annual performance-based bonuses that can be as high as half of his salary.\n\nLike many executives of publicly traded social media companies, Mosseri, who's been head of Meta's Instagram since 2018, also earns stock-based compensation.\n\nFrom the witness stand, Mosseri said that his stock-based pay varies year to year but that it has been in the \"tens of millions of dollars.\" Some years, he said, he believes it's been over $20 million.\n\nMosseri made the comments while being questioned in Los Angeles Superior Court over a lawsuit that argues Meta and YouTube knowingly engineered their platforms to addict and cause harm to kids. Snap and TikTok were also named in the lawsuit but settled before trial for undisclosed amounts.\n\nMark Lanier, the attorney representing the plaintiff, pressed Mosseri on how the company determined its policy on cosmetic filters, such as filters that alter users' appearances, which was a key topic in court on Wednesday. He brought up Mosseri's compensation again while asking whether banning filters could have hurt Mosseri's bottom line by limiting the company's growth.\n\n\"I was never worried about this affecting our stock price,\" Mosseri said in court.\n\nMeta declined to comment about Mosseri's compensation.\n\nThe lawsuit centers on a 20-year-old woman, identified by the initials KGM, who says her use of social media throughout her childhood negatively affected her mental health, contributing to depression and suicidal thoughts.\n\nThe case is considered a bellwether trial that could indicate how other similar lawsuits related to social media addiction might play out.\n\n\"We strongly disagree with these allegations and are confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people,\" Stephanie Otway, a Meta spokesperson, told Business Insider. Otway said the company has been making \" meaningful changes—like introducing Teen Accounts with built-in protections and providing parents with tools to manage their teens' experiences.\"",

Benioff also complained about Bad Bunny's Super Bowl performance, the people said.\n\nSalesforce hasn't responded to multiple requests about Benioff's comments and did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nSalesforce executives, including Slack's new general manager, addressed Benioff's jokes. Slack general manager Rob Seaman wrote in an internal Slack message viewed by Business Insider: \"I cannot defend or explain them. They do not align with my personal values and I know this to be the case for many of you as well.\"\n\nSome Salesforce employees said they received an email asking them to explain their absence from the event following Benioff's remarks.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "James Van Der Beek was diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal cancer in 2023. He hoped more young people would get screened.",
    "fullText": "James Van Der Beek has died at 48.\n\nIn 2023, the \"Dawson's Creek\" star learned he had stage 3 colorectal cancer at 46. He publicly shared his diagnosis a year later.\n\nVan Der Beek's death comes weeks after a report revealed that colon cancer has become the leading cause of cancer death in people under 50. In 2020, Chadwick Boseman also died from colorectal cancer, at 43, and Catherine O'Hara, who died from a pulmonary embolism last week at 71, had also been diagnosed with rectal cancer.\n\nAfter announcing his diagnosis, Van Der Beek spoke about the importance of getting screened, as rates continue to rise.\n\nSome of the most common symptoms of colon cancer include rectal bleeding, changes in bowel movements, bloating, and abdominal pain.\n\nHowever, they can be subtle, as was the case with Van Der Beek. \"It didn't feel like a real symptom of anything,\" he previously told Business Insider. \"It wasn't anything that made me rush off to go get screened.\"\n\nBecause colon cancer symptoms overlap with GI issues like IBS or hemorrhoids, some people also get misdiagnosed for years — especially if they're young and fit. \n\nJoshua Demb, a researcher who studies early-onset colon cancer and is an assistant professor at the University of California, San Diego, previously told Business Insider that the key is noticing which symptoms feel unusual for you. Even slight stomach pain or bloating can be worth checking out if you otherwise never experience it.\n\nWhile exercising and cutting back on ultra-processed foods are some of the best ways to reduce your overall cancer risk, they're not guaranteed to prevent colon cancer.\n\nVan Der Beek said his diagnosis shocked him because he was \"doing all the biohacking things,\" including eating a balanced diet. \"I was doing sauna, cold plunge, weightlifting, Pilates,\" he said. \"I would dance and also do football training.\"\n\nColon cancer patients who previously spoke to Business Insider expressed similar surprise at their diagnoses, including a personal trainer who ate clean and a marathon runner. It makes it all the more prudent not to assume that an active lifestyle, whole foods-focused diet, and lack of severe symptoms mean you're in the clear.\n\nAfter his diagnosis, Van Der Beek became a spokesperson for Guardant Health to promote the Shield blood test, a less invasive alternative to getting a colonoscopy.\n\nFrom his own colonoscopy experience, he said the procedure could put some people off of screening. \"I did not find a colonoscopy to be all that pleasant,\" he said. \"For people who are in a job where they can't take that kind of time off of work, it can be a challenge.\"\n\nOther at-home tests like Cologuard and the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) are alternative options for people at or above 45, the recommended screening age for colon cancer.\n\nThat being said, colonoscopies are still considered the gold standard in colon cancer screening because they can offer a chance to spot and remove potentially precancerous polyps.\n\nHowever one decides to get screened, Van Der Beek hoped to inspire more people to do it in the first place.\n\n\"That's my biggest message,\" he said. \"Get screened.\"",

With gratitude and a broken heart.\"\n\nA spokesperson for GoFundMe told Business Insider, \"We are working with the organizer to ensure funds safely reach the intended beneficiary.\"\n\nThey added, \"Funds are being held safely by our payment processor in the meantime.\" The company confirmed the funds were going to James's wife.\n\nKimberly announced her husband's death on Instagram, saying, \"Our beloved James David Van Der Beek passed peacefully this morning. \n\n\"He met his final days with courage, faith, and grace. There is much to share regarding his wishes, love for humanity, and the sacredness of time. Those days will come. \n\n\"For now we ask for peaceful privacy as we grieve our loving husband, father, son, brother, and friend.\"\n\nVan Der Beek received his cancer diagnosis three years ago. He made his final public appearance on NBC in December when he seemed optimistic about his health.\n\n\"I feel much, much better than I did a couple months ago,\" Van Der Beek told interviewer Craig Melvin.\n\nHe added, \"It's been a longer journey than I ever thought it would be. It's required more of me — more patience, more discipline, more strength than I knew I had. I knew I was strong — I didn't know I was this strong.\"\n\nThe same month, the 90s heartthrob auctioned off personal memorabilia from the filming of \"Dawson's Creek\" to help his family and meet bills for his cancer treatment.",

    "title": "Apple Just Released iOS 26.3 With These New Features",
    "description": "Here's what's new with Apple's sequel to iOS 26.2.",
    "fullText": "It's officially time for another iPhone update: Apple dropped iOS 26.3 for compatible iPhones on Wednesday, following nearly two months of beta testing. Unlike iOS 26 itself, or even iOS 26.1 and iOS 26.2, iOS 26.3 isn't exactly feature-filled. But there are some interesting (and important) changes that are worth noting, including an easier way to leave iPhone altogether.\n\nBack in December, we learned about a small but substantial new iOS feature: an official way to make transferring between an iPhone and an Android device more seamless. In iOS' \"Transfer or Reset iPhone\" settings, there is now a new \"Transfer to Android\" option. Tap it, and iOS instructs you to place your iPhone near your Android device; from there, you can choose to pass along data like photos, messages, notes, and apps. However, it seems not all data will transfer: Health data, devices paired with Bluetooth, and \"protected items\" like locked notes will not come along with this transfer feature.\n\nApple actually worked with Google directly on this feature, which means it doesn't just go one way: Android users will have a similar option on their end to transfer to iPhone. But those of us updating our iPhones to iOS 26.3 now have an easier escape route if we choose to switch platforms.\n\nWith iOS 26.3, Apple is giving certain users the ability to stop sharing their precise location with their cellular network providers. The new feature, \"Limit Precise Location,\" reduces the exactness of the location data that is shared with cellular networks. That way, the network can determine your general location, but not your precise location. What that means in practical terms, at least according to Apple, is that the network might know what neighborhood you're in, but not the exact street address.\n\nAt this time, only Boost Mobile users in the U.S. will be able to use this feature with iOS 26.3. It also only works with some iOS devices, including the iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, and iPad Pro M5 Wi-Fi + Cellular. Hopefully, this will make its way to more cellular plans and more iPhones in the future, but for now, it's a pretty limited feature. While most of us won't be able to limit precise location sharing with the network, we can at least stop apps from harvesting this data.\n\nTalk about a small update: With iOS 26.3, Apple is breaking \"Weather\" and \"Astronomy\" into their own wallpaper sections. (Previously, these two categories were paired.) While Astronomy features the standard space wallpapers found in iOS 26.2 and earlier, Weather now features three preset wallpapers, with different font options and weather widgets.\n\nBack in September, we learned Apple was quietly working on some type of notification forwarding feature, but other than that basic functionality, the details were left to speculation. At the time, the common assumption was that Apple intended the feature to be used to forward notifications to third-party devices, specifically smartwatches, in an attempt to open up the platform to wearables other than the Apple Watch. This wouldn't be Apple's choice, of course—left to its own devices, the company would keep as many features locked to Apple devices as possible. Instead, the motivation would come from the E.U, which has compelled Apple to make its platforms more cooperative with third-party devices.\n\nAs it happens, this feature is now launching with iOS 26.3—albeit, only in the EU (With the first iOS 26.3 beta, Apple added a “Notification Forwarding” option in Notification settings for all iPhones. They have since removed this option, since the feature is EU-only.) While the option isn't live at this time, Apple does have a description for how the feature works, saying that notifications can be forwarded to one device at a time. Importantly, the description says that when notifications are forwarded to another device, they will not appear on your Apple Watch. Is that limitation really necessary, Apple?\n\nEU iPhone users are also getting another interesting feature with iOS 26.3. The new update will allow users to pair third-party accessories with their iPhones by bringing the devices close together, similar to how pairing AirPods to iPhones works. Developers will need to add this functionality to their devices before this works, of course, but the new update makes it possible.\n\nApple typically bundles its feature updates, like iOS 26.3, with stability patches, including for bugs and security vulnerabilities. This update is no different. Apple's security notes for iOS 26.3 list 37 patches for security vulnerabilities, covering issues across iOS. The most important by far patches an issue with dyld, Apple's \"Dynamic Link Editor,\" which Apple says may have been used in a \"sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.\" The company has used this language before, usually referring to attacks against high-profile users from governments or large organizations. As such, most users likely won't be affected by this bug, but better safe than sorry: update ASAP.\n\nOther important security updates include a patch for a Photos bug that could let someone access your photos from the Lock Screen; a fix for a Screenshots issue that could let an attacker see your deleted notes; a patch for a UIKit bug that could let someone take screenshots of sensitive data when using iPhone Mirroring with Mac; and a fix for a VoiceOver bug that could let an attacker view sensitive information even when your iPhone is locked.",

    "description": "Threat actors get full access to compromised devices.",
    "fullText": "Threat actors don't have to work that hard to obtain sophisticated malware to deploy against unsuspecting targets. A new spyware platform known as ZeroDayRAT is reportedly being sold on Telegram, complete with customer support and updates.\n\nAccording to mobile security company iVerify, this aggressive spyware grants full remote control over devices running Android 15 through 16 and iOS versions up to iOS 26. Once deployed, it allows everything from user profiling and location tracking to live surveillance and financial theft.\n\nThis spyware has wide-ranging capabilities that, according to iVerify, have traditionally been found on platforms sponsored by state actors. Here's a look at what ZeroDayRAT can do:\n\nCollect information about the device, such as model, OS, battery, country, lock status, SIM and carrier info, app usage, live activity, and SMS message previews. This allows threat actors to develop user profiles for further targeting.\n\nPull GPS coordinates, capture notifications from apps and systems, and harvest account information, such as usernames and emails.\n\nSend SMS messages and receive verification codes to bypass two-factor authentication.\n\nLog keystrokes (including biometric unlocks, gestures, and app launches), access the camera and microphone, and screen record.\n\nLog crypto wallet addresses and target banking and payment app credentials via overlay attacks.\n\nZeroDayRAT can infect your device only if a malicious binary—an APK on Android or iOS payload—is downloaded and installed. These may be distributed through phishing, such as links sent via emails, texts, or messaging platforms, as well as in fake app stores.\n\nAll standard guidance for avoiding scams and malware applies: never click links in unsolicited communication, including conversations in apps like Telegram and WhatsApp, and only download apps and extensions from official, trusted sources.\n\nUsers at high risk of being targeted and anyone who wants an extra layer of security can consider enabling Lockdown Mode (iOS) or Advanced Protection (Android).",

    "title": "TikTok's First US-Exclusive Feature Is a Local Feed That Wants Your Location Data",
    "description": "You'll see content relevant to where you are, and you can opt-in to give TikTok your GPS data.",
    "fullText": "It hasn't even been a month since the U.S. arm of TikTok came under new ownership, and already American users are getting an exclusive feature. In a surprise move, the app today introduced a new \"Local Feed\" specific to U.S. users, ostensibly aimed at helping Americans see content from their immediate area. Technically, it's similar to the \"Nearby Feed\" that was introduced in the U.K. and Europe in December, although this specific iteration might differ in the minor details, like the name. Perhaps more importantly, the company wants access to your GPS data to power the Local Feed, but it's opt-in, and you can still use a version of the local feed without sharing it.\n\nTikTok announced its Local Feed today, and it has already popped up in my app without the need for an update or for me to opt into seeing it. It's located to the left of the Following feed, and tapping on it brings you to a scrollable list of posts rather than the usual \"swipe-to-navigate\" autoplaying videos. TikTok says that the feed is \"designed to help you discover and connect with content, businesses, and services wherever you are,\" and yeah, what I saw was mostly restaurant recommendations for New York City.\n\nIt's worth noting that I was already occasionally getting these recommendations on my For You feed, and when I go on vacation, these posts usually change to match wherever I'm staying. So the app's algorithm did already take location into account, at least to a degree. But the Local Feed allows you to choose when to see those posts, instead of waiting for the For You feed to show them to you at its discretion. It also, supposedly, can make them even more specific to your location, which I'll get into shortly.\n\n(Note that while it does originally display as a scrollable list, hopping into a video will allow you to swipe through the feed as usual.)\n\nThe Local Feed showed up for me automatically when I opened my app today, and TikTok confirmed to me on a phone call that you do not have to opt in to seeing it. However, there are some restrictions to what gets posted to it. For instance, accounts belonging to users under the age of 18 won't have their content featured in the Local Feed, and neither will private accounts or accounts where post privacy is set to Friends or Only You.\n\nWhat is slightly concerning about TikTok's Local Feed is a disclaimer towards the bottom of the post announcing it, noting that TikTok will use your GPS location to \"help power the Local Feed.\" However, in a phone call, the company clarified to me that this isn't so clear cut. Essentially, there are two ways for TikTok's Local Feed to know where you are, \"coarse location data collection\" and \"precise GPS data collection.\"\n\nCoarse data collection is how the app worked previously, and it uses information like your IP address, which network you're connecting from, and some of your posting activity (such as how you've been tagged) to generally figure out where you are. This does not use your GPS, and is more similar to, say, Netflix knowing that you're watching from the U.S. based on your wifi network. This functionality cannot be disabled, but TikTok confirmed to me that it tends to only narrow your location down to a county this way, and both the For You feed and the Local Feed can then use that to find information that's relevant to you. Essentially, this is how the app has operated for years, and TikTok confirmed to me that \"nothing has changed with respect to approximate location.\"\n\nWhat's new is the ability to share your precise GPS data with TikTok, which isn't mandatory for the Local Feed to work, but will be used to help the Local Feed deliver even more specific content. For instance, it might show you content for Red Hook or Astoria (specific neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens) rather than just content related to all of Brooklyn or Queens.. According to a TikTok support page, you'll find the toggle to enable this in the TikTok app under Settings and privacy > Privacy, although it's still rolling out to some users, and I don't have it yet.\n\nAccording to the TikTok representative I spoke with, there was initially some confusion among users, as the Local Feed appeared to be showing them content specific to their area even while the app did not appear to be tracking their GPS location in their phones' settings (for iPhone, this is under Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services). However, I was told this was drawn from existing coarse location data (described above), and if you do not have the option to enable Location Services in the TikTok app or you do not see the TikTok app located on the Location Services page in your device settings, then you can rest assured that TikTok cannot access your GPS data.\n\nThat should come as a relief to anyone concerned about TikTok's new privacy policy, which initially appeared to give the company permission to gather your \"precise location\" so long as you had location services enabled on your phone, but now reads that location services need to be enabled for the TikTok app specifically for that to be the case.\n\nIn other words, the Local Feed does not track your GPS data by default, but that doesn't mean you won't see anything if you don't opt in to sharing your GPS data—it'll instead use the same course location data the app has had access to for years to fill that feed. If you want more precise content and are OK with the app tracking your GPS data, then, you simply need to wait for TikTok Location Services to be rolled out to you and then enable it in the TikTok app under Settings > Security and privacy > Location Services.\n\nIf you don't, the company \"does not have access to your precise location,\" a fact noted in a later update to the initial post announcing the Local Feed. Meanwhile, if you don't see the Location Services toggle on that page at all, then according to the update, \"you don't have access to the feature\" yet and need to wait for it to roll out to you. Whatever the case, until you enable that setting, the Local Feed will use approximate data instead.\n\nIf you do enable Location Services for TikTok, the company says it will only track your location while you're using the app, and that when it does, you will see an on-screen indicator while your location is being accessed. Additionally, accounts for users under the age of 18 will be unable to turn GPS sharing on, although it remains optional for all users regardless, and is set to off by default.\n\nMeanwhile, if you want to turn off approximate location tracking, your only choice is to delete the app altogether—although that was also true before the Local Feed was introduced.\n\nUpdate 2/11/2026 at 4:22 PM: Added clarification from TikTok about how the Local Feed feature works, and when it does and doesn't access your data.",

    "title": "The Telegram App Has a New Look, and a Weird New Feature",
    "description": "You can now \"craft\" gifts within the chat app for some reason.",
    "fullText": "If your chat app of choice is Telegram, you have some changes to look forward to. The company announced a number of updates this week, chief among them a new look for its Android and iOS apps—the former is getting a total overhaul, but iPhone users will still note some new UI elements when chatting with friends on Telegram. There are also some new features, including one I find a little odd.\n\nPer the announcement, the biggest changes come via UI updates, particularly on Android. Telegram says that its Android app has a \"fully redesigned interface\" intended to make navigating the app quicker and more intuitive—Telegram notes the interface code itself was entirely rebuilt to meet these goals. Changes include a new iOS-like bottom bar that lets you switch between your chats, settings, and profile, among other functionality. If you find the new interface effects to be too much, or too big a draw on your battery, Telegram says you can adjust them from Settings > Power Saving.\n\nThe company also updated its iOS app, though not quite in the same way. Telegram says it added \"even more Liquid Glass\" to its iOS app, Apple's new design language for iOS 26, including a redesigned media viewer, sticker and emoji pack preview panels, and new context menus in profiles when choosing messages.\n\nAs of this latest update, if the owner of a Telegram group chat leaves that conversation, the ownership of the group will transfer automatically to one of the group's admins after a week. However, the departing group owner can also choose their own admin if they want to, as Telegram now presets an option to appoint another admin when leaving the group. The company adds that admins can transfer ownership at any time, even if they don't leave.\n\nA small change, but if you develop bots for Telegram, you now have the option to add colors and emojis to those buttons. It's far from a radical update, but it could make it a bit easier to tell options apart at a glance.\n\nA small but noteworthy feature for any Telegram users on iPad: Now, you can send a message using the shortcut \"Command + Enter.\"\n\nAnd here's that weird new feature: I don't usually expect my chat app to offer collectible gifts, but apparently Telegram does. It previously introduced the ability to send gifts to other people, and even upgrade those gifts to collectibles that can be auctioned on NFT marketplaces (which requires real money).\n\nNow, Telegram is reportedly expanding this gift system in the latest update with the ability to combine existing gifts in a new \"crafting\" system to create \"Uncommon, Rare, Epic or Legendary\" versions. You can combine up to four gifts at once, and adding multiple gifts with the same \"attributes\" raises the chance the crafted gift will have that attribute as well. Again, this is the last thing I'd expect or want from a chat app, but, as it's part of this update, so I'm telling you about it.",

    "title": "How Deep Should You Squat?",
    "description": "Most people should squat \"to parallel,\" but there are times for going higher or lower.",
    "fullText": "I’m one who can appreciate the great diversity of squats in the world. High squats, low squats, front squats, back squats—they’re all beautiful. And yet, people on the internet love to argue about which squat is the best. So here’s a little guide to squat depth, and how to find the squat that’s right for you. The short, easy answer is that you probably want to squat \"to parallel,\" and I'll explain what that means, but there are advantages to squatting lower and higher than parallel, depending on your goals in the gym.\n\nWhen people talk about how \"deep\" a squat is, they're referring to how low you get your hips. Some strong and flexible people can squat all the way down until their thighs are touching their calves and their butts are nearly on the ground. Sometimes this is called an \"ass-to-grass\" squat.\n\nIf you can only bend your knees partway before the movement falls apart, you might be told that you're squatting \"high,\" or that you aren't squatting \"to depth.\" If the person who says this is a coach, trainer, or a friend whose advice you value, listen to them, and try to squat deeper. (In a minute I'll give you some tips for how to do that.) On the other hand, if that person is some internet rando or a busybody at your local gym, you do not owe them any specific squat depth and they should mind their own business.\n\nGenerally, the higher a squat is, the easier it tends to be, meaning you can move more weight. When you're training you'll want some to find a way to be consistent. For example, if you squat 225 pounds to parallel at the beginning of your training program, and 315 as a super-high half-squat by the end, you cannot legitimately say that you added 90 pounds to your squat, as the parallel squat and the high squat are basically two different lifts. Pick a depth, and stick to it.\n\nThe best squat depth for most people is squatting \"to parallel.\" This means your thighs are parallel with the floor, or to put it another way, your hips and your knees are about on the same level. (If your hips go lower than your knees, you're \"below parallel\" and if your hips stay above your knees you are \"above parallel.\")\n\nThis is how most people define a full squat, and it's a definition that comes from convenience: It's easy to see when somebody is squatting to parallel, and this makes it easy for a trainer or a competition judge to tell when you're doing a squat. It also keeps things consistent for your training. If you squat to parallel every time, you know you're doing the same difficulty of squat from week to week.\n\nIf you compete in powerlifting, you know that judges will look very carefully at your position in the bottom of the squat to know whether you're doing the lift according to the rulebook. Usually the rule is that your hip joint (or the crease of your hip) needs to go lower than the top of your kneecap. Roughly, this corresponds to your thigh being parallel to the floor, and so people will describe this position as “parallel.” Here’s a video showing what this depth means, and how judges see it:\n\nDo not try to judge this in the mirror while you are squatting! Your eyes aren't at the right level to judge it accurately. Instead, video yourself from the side (with the camera at or below hip level), or ask a friend to watch you squat and tell you if you're hitting the right depth. Another way to make sure you're squatting to a consistent depth is to find a bench or box of an appropriate height, and tap your butt on it with each rep.\n\nYou get more range of motion, thus engaging your muscles better, than if you did a higher squat.\n\nMost people can achieve a parallel squat with training, so even if your mobility isn't great when you first start training, this is an achievable goal.\n\nYou may be able to squat more weight this way than if you go lower.\n\nIt's easier to keep your feet in a stable position on the floor in a parallel squat than in a lower squat (see the point above about mobility).\n\nYou have a consistent basis of comparison from one set to another. (If your squats get higher the more weight you load on the bar, you aren't actually as strong as you think.)\n\nWhat about squatting lower than parallel? First, if you're using \"parallel\" as your gauge, technically any squat lower than parallel still meets the requirement. If you enter a powerlifting competition and squat until your butt is nearly touching your shoes, that's still a legal squat. There's no such thing as being red-lighted for going too low.\n\nBut usually people only squat that low if they have a good reason to do so. Sometimes that reason is personal preference: You may find that your squats are more comfortable (and you may even be able to lift more weight!) if you let your hamstrings kind of bounce off your calves at the bottom of the squat. As long as it's a controlled, precise movement, it's safe and may be effective for you, depending on your body type.\n\nYou'll also often see olympic weightlifters squatting very low. That's because they use squats to help train leg strength for lifts like cleans and snatches, and when you do a clean or a snatch you'll usually end up in a low squat position. Essentially, they train the specific positions that their sport demands.\n\nLow squats are also popular among some gym-goers who want to work on mobility at the same time as strength, or who want to make sure they're training their legs through their full range of motion.\n\nAn important caveat is that not everybody feels comfortable squatting low. If you don't have good ankle mobility, you may not be able to get into a low squat position while keeping your body balanced and your feet firmly on the ground. This position may also put more strain on your knees than you would like, leading some people with knee injuries to prefer higher squats. (That said, deep squats are not proven to lead to knee injuries, no matter what that busybody at your gym says.)\n\nYou train a larger range-of-motion for your leg and hip muscles than with a parallel squat.\n\nYou may see more muscle growth for your glutes and adductors, according to some research.\n\nYou keep your hips and ankles limber.\n\nYou will be better prepared for snatches, cleans, pistol squats, and other movements that require mobility in a deep squat position.\n\nAllow me to pause while the purists clutch their pearls, faint, and wait to be revived, before I note that it's actually not a terrible idea to purposely squat above parallel. There is a place for this in many people's training! I define high squats as those where your hip joint doesn't even get close to being on the same level as your knee. These are sometimes called \"half squats\" (because you're only going halfway to parallel) or sometimes even \"quarter squats,\" if you're just bending your knees a bit.\n\nHalf/quarter squats can be a legitimate training tool, especially for people who train for sports that involve running and jumping. You rarely find yourself in a full squat position in, say, basketball, so training full squats may not be a high priority in the weight room. On the other hand, training half squats can let you load up even more weight than you would use for a parallel squat, letting you overload the upper end of that range of motion.\n\nHigh squats are also often done out of necessity. If you don't yet have the mobility for a parallel squat, or if you're working around an injury that prevents you from bending your knees all the way, you may need to choose between squatting high or not squatting at all. In most of those cases, squatting high is the better option of the two. To make sure you have a consistent target for every set of squats, you can use a tall box, placed just behind you, and squat down just until your butt touches the box. (You can also use a shorter box over time if you are working toward lower squats.)\n\nHalf squats can build strength for running and jumping sports.\n\nSquatting high is better than not squatting at all.\n\nSquatting high may be a stepping stone to getting back to normal depth when dealing with an injury or other issue that prevents you from doing parallel or lower squats.\n\nWhat if you want to squat deeper, but you can't? Most of the time, the issue is ankle mobility. Even though your legs are doing most of the work, and your back is helping to support the weight of the bar, the weak link in your squat is the flexibility of your ankles. Your ankles need to bend pretty deeply to allow you to squat to parallel or lower.\n\nI put together a guide to improving your ankle mobility for squats, but for a quick fix, you can put plates under your heels or wear specialized weightlifting shoes, like these. In addition, make sure to do some calf and ankle stretches before beginning your squats for the day. A few more stretches at the end of the day (or on non-lifting days) can help to get you more ankle mobility over the long term.\n\nYou can also work on ankle mobility over time with stretching and foam rolling. Also, try different stance widths and different types of squats (front squats, goblet squats, high bar, low bar) to see if some are more comfortable for you than others.\n\nOkay, so what if you don’t compete in any squat-centric sport, and you can see upsides to each of the depths we discussed above? Here’s squatting’s dirty secret: It doesn’t matter. The squat police won't come to arrest you if your squats are too high (though some of your gym buddies may heckle you about it, because why aren’t you going deeper?).\n\nYou can move more weight if you only do a partial squat, and every gym has people who will tell you about their huge squat PRs but then it turns out they weren’t getting anywhere near parallel. If you are cheating your squats so you can brag about your numbers, swallow your ego and squat to parallel already.\n\nNor will the squat police come for you if you squat extremely low—but once a week or so, a stranger will tell you you’re going to \"ruin your knees\" squatting like that. You may ignore them. Low squats aren’t inherently bad for your knees, so if you feel fine, you can keep on keepin’ on. (I discuss this myth at length in my guide to squats.)\n\nThat said, if you don’t like squatting low, but you do it because somebody told you you “should,” feel free to ditch that advice and squat to the level you prefer. Squatting ass-to-grass does not make you a better person.",

    "description": "BBC Scotland examines the lie of the land in the Scottish Premiership title race.",
    "fullText": "On a cold Tuesday evening, with 87 minutes of the Edinburgh derby gone, it seemed the Scottish Premiership title momentum was about to jolt towards Glasgow.\n\nBut then Tomas Magnusson popped up in the Hibernian box to knock in a late winner for leaders Hearts. As Tynecastle rocked, the reverberations were felt far west.\n\nThe Gorgie side has restored their advantage to a full six points before their title rivals played. The standard had been set. Keep up if you can.\n\nTime for Wednesday, when Celtic hosted Livingston and Rangers headed to mighty Motherwell, who sit on the top three's coattails in fourth, at Fir Park.\n\nIf you thought Tuesday was dramatic, Wednesday certainly did not disappoint.\n\nWith 90 minutes played at Parkhead, there was a shock on the cards. Livingston, a side without a win in 23 games and who've just changed manager, were about to hold Celtic to a draw.\n\nUp stepped Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, curling in a winner from the edge of the box, on his Celtic debut. His first goal in any game of football for 14 months, and the first time he'd stepped on a pitch since May 2025.\n\nCeltic remain third, but are now a point behind Rangers and within six of Hearts, with a game in hand over both.\n\nOver in North Lanarkshire, it seemed more simple for Rangers. A goal to the good thanks to Nico Raskin's early strike, they also had a man advantage after Lukas Fadinger's red card.\n\nIt seemed they had answered the challenge laid down to them by Hearts, only for Motherwell defender Stephen Welsh to lash home a late equaliser that Danny Rohl's side could not respond to.\n\nRemember, this is on-loan Stephen Welsh who made two appearances for Celtic in January after being recalled, only to rejoin Motherwell on deadline day.\n\n\"Just when there's a twist of fate at Celtic Park a few minutes ago, it's a Celtic player who then comes up with huge goal for Motherwell,\" pundit Stephen Craigan said.\n\n\"Another chapter in what is proving to be the best season we've seen in such a long time,\" was ex-Hearts midfielder Michael Stewart's analysis on Sportsound.\n\nFrom a huge game on Wednesday, to an even bigger one on Sunday afternoon. First travels to second when Hearts go to Ibrox to face Rangers.\n\nDerek McInnes' side won there earlier in the season, for the first time since 2014. They beat Rangers at Tynecastle, too, in a 2-1 win in December.\n\nBut, Rohl's men haven't lost since then. In fact, they've drawn twice and won seven. It's resurgent form that looks a world away from a team which were once 13 points adrift in the title race under Russell Martin.\n\n\"I think it is a pretty good point [against Motherwell] but as Danny Rohl mentioned, there's a massive game on Sunday [against Hearts] and that starts to look like a must-win,\" said former Rangers midfielder Derek Ferguson.\n\nCeltic will be looking on, crossing their fingers and wishing for a draw.\n\nThey'll be fresh off the back of a game against Kilmarnock down at Rugby Park. The last time they were, they won thanks to a late Kelechi Iheanacho penalty.\n\nThey'll need a better performance than the one against Livingston. Although they peppered the visitors' goal with shots, the lack of cutting edge will be a worry.\n\n\"Celtic were running out of ideas, very predictable, just playing it across, hoping rather than making it happen, and they just got away with it right at the end,\" said former keeper Pat Bonner.\n\n\"What a huge three points it is for Celtic. They'll be relieved.\"\n\nIt was another sterling performance from Motherwell, adding to a catalogue of fine showings this season.\n\nAgainst the top three, they have two draws with Hearts, two draws and a loss against Rangers, and a win and loss to Celtic.\n\nSeven points against the title favourites is no bad return and many Motherwell fans might be wondering \"what if?\"\n\nWhat if they hadn't drawn their first five league games? What if they hadn't chucked away a 3-0 lead over Hearts at Tynecastle?\n\nWhat if Calum Ward hadn't passed it straight to a Celtic player when they were 2-1 up at Celtic Park with 20 minutes to go?\n\nThey sit seven points behind third-placed Celtic, eight behind Rangers and 13 behind Hearts. It's most likely a step too far, but one of the Old Firm might be within their reach, including holding a game in hand over Rangers and the league leaders.\n\n\"What a team Motherwell are,\" Stewart gushed. \"They are such a great watch and showed some real desire.\n\n\"One nil down at home, down to 10 men, and they never buckled one little bit. They kept throwing everything at it. That's a good point for Rangers, because Motherwell were so on top.\"\n\nFormer Rangers midfielder Derek Ferguson agreed: \"This is a Motherwell side that have been absolutely flying and they've shown different sides to their game tonight.\"",

    "description": "The Clarets' remarkable first-half fightback keeps alive their slim hopes of Premier League survival, but where does it leave Crystal Palace?",
    "fullText": "When Burnley fans first heard the news that their team bus had been caught up in traffic on the way to Selhurst Park – and that their game at Crystal Palace would be delayed by 10 minutes as a result – they may have been fearing the worst.\n\nAfter all, this was hardly ideal preparation for a team lying second bottom in the Premier League table, 11 points adrift of safety and without a win in their last 16 top-flight games.\n\nWith 12 minutes of the first half remaining, by which time Jorgen Strand Larsen's double had helped Palace breeze into a 2-0 first-half lead, the Clarets faithful will have been resigned to another bruising defeat, continuing their agonising slide back towards the Championship.\n\nTuesday's encounter had been following a familiar script. Parker's team had not only given away two easy goals, they had failed to register a shot on target in the first 39 minutes of the contest.\n\nThe seven that followed had to be seen to be believed.\n\nHannibal Mejbri made it 2-1 with his first goal of the season, before Jaidon Anthony arrowed a low shot into the corner to bring Burnley level four minutes later.\n\nBurnley's extraordinary comeback was complete in first-half stoppage time, when goalkeeper Dean Henderson parried Bashir Humphreys' header on to the foot of Jefferson Lerma and into the net to spark jubilant, almost disbelieving scenes in the away end.\n\nThis extraordinary result may prove too little, too late for the Clarets in their battle to avoid relegation.\n\nBut it was just the tonic for manager Scott Parker, who was subjected to chants of 'you don't know what you're doing' and 'you're getting sacked in the morning' by his own supporters during last weekend's defeat by West Ham at Turf Moor.\n\n'Up to owner to make change' - Dyche under major scrutiny\n\nWill West Ham make 40-point mark crucial in relegation fight?\n\nHaving endured one of his toughest afternoons of his Burnley tenure on Saturday, Parker looked like he was trying to keep a lid on his emotions after Tuesday's astonishing victory.\n\nBut you could hear the fierce pride in Parker's voice as he spoke about his players' heroics in his post-match interview with TNT Sports.\n\n\"There aren't many teams who would come back here after going 2-0 down,\" he said. \"It speaks absolute volumes for this group.\n\n\"If there was ever any question about how together this group is, how committed this group is, how resilient this group is – [tonight] said it all, really.\"\n\nParker's team remain nine points adrift of safety with only 12 matches of the 2025/26 season left to play.\n\nBut neither Parker, nor his players have given up hope of mounting a late survival charge.\n\n\"There has always been belief [that we can stay up],\" he continued. \"The results over the last few months probably haven't gone our way, but tonight that definitely was the case,\" he said.\n\n\"Coming off the back of an incredibly tough game for us at the weekend – for many reasons – that performance showed a group that is full of resilience, full of commitment.\n\n\"You don't get that result without proper resilience, standing up to certain battles and certain situations. The biggest lesson for any group is to keep coming back up.\n\n\"We certainly did that tonight.\"\n\nSo where does Tuesday's result leave Palace?\n\nIn stark contrast to his opposite number, Oliver Glasner looked ashen-faced when he addressed the media after the full-time whistle, which was greeted by loud boos from the Palace supporters.\n\nHaving watched his team arrest a 12-match winless run against arch rivals Brighton last time out, Glasner looked set to mark his 100th match in charge of the club with another morale-boosting win after Strand Larsen's double.\n\nBut Palace froze after Mejbri had pulled a goal back for Burnley, who took full advantage of the hosts' inertia to inflict one of the most painful defeats of the Austrian's Selhurst Park tenure.\n\n\"It's not acceptable,\" Glasner, who is leaving the club in the summer, told TNT Sports. \"I can't explain it. Maybe [the first 39 minutes] were too easy.\n\n\"The start was very good. We controlled everything, [but] I've watched all the goals back and it's just not acceptable how we defended as a team – just jogging around, not in the duels, not in the second balls.\"\n\nAnother issue, according to Glasner, is the presence of a Marc Guehi-sized hole in the Palace defence.\n\nThe England defender left for Manchester City for an initial £20m last month in a move which incurred the wrath of Glasner, who announced his own departure not long afterwards.\n\n\"Right now, we don't have someone on the pitch who leads the team in these moments, who makes players calm and decides the meaning of the game,\" he said.\n\n\"I praise the boys very often for their effort. When you throw the game away like we did, you don't deserve to win.\"\n\nPalace are still eight points above the bottom three – a sizeable cushion, but one not comfortable enough for a side with only one win in all competitions since 11 December.\n\nDefeat at home to Wolves in their next league game really would set alarm bells ringing.\n\nLatest Burnley news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Burnley - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain only had 14 touches after being introduced for his Celtic debut as a 78th-minute substitute against Livingston on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, one of them could have a telling influence on the Scottish Premiership title race.\n\nThe defending champions were on course to drop points against the division's bottom club after missing chance after chance, with visiting goalkeeper Jerome Prior making nine saves in total.\n\nBut Oxlade-Chamberlain - who arrived on a free transfer on Saturday on a deal until the end of the season - whipped home his first Celtic goal in stoppage time to secure a 2-1 win, sparing blushes and narrowing the gap to Hearts at the top to six points.\n\nIt was not the finish of a man whose previous game of football was last May and has been without a club since being released by Besiktas in August.\n\nInstead, it was a reminder of the quality that helped him win three FA Cups with Arsenal, the Champions League, Premier League and League Cup with Liverpool, while also establishing a regular spot in England's midfield.\n\n\"It was a class goal from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain,\" former Scotland midfielder Michael Stewart said on BBC Radio Scotland.\n\n\"Just a calm, composed, quality finish. What an impact he's had already.\"\n\nCeltic 'perfect fit' as Oxlade-Chamberlain signs\n\nOxlade-Chamberlain scores debut winner as Celtic scrape past Livi\n\nInterim manager Martin O'Neil - who remains unbeaten in domestic competition across both his spells in charge this season - was delighted by his newest signing's contribution.\n\n\"We didn't look like we were going to get any reward at all and Alex scores this brilliant goal,\" the Northern Irishman said.\n\n\"When it left his foot, I could see it going in and that was a real delight.\n\n\"He's been a really fine player in his career, an excellent career. It's just a matter of him getting up to speed and I think that will come. He's naturally fit and hopefully he will be a big asset to us.\n\n\"He had a choice of a lot of teams. He's decided to come up here and help us out. He's done more than that, he's got us three points on the board.\"\n\nOxlade-Chamberlain has been training with Arsenal in recent months and thanked the Premier League leaders for helping him to hit the ground running in Glasgow.\n\n\"It means a lot,\" he said after his dramatic return to competitive action.\n\n\"I have to say a big thank you to everyone at Arsenal, giving me the chance to keep my fitness up, and an even bigger thanks to the manager here for giving me the chance to put on this kit and play for this amazing club.\n\n\"When you get those opportunities, you want to be able to pay back with moments of quality like that.\n\n\"It's been difficult. Sometimes the way things go in football, especially when you cross that 30-years-of-age barrier, you're not as valuable as you once were in a business sense.\n\n\"I knew I still had a lot to give and training every day for the last three months where I was training gave me the confidence that I can still offer a lot to the game.\n\n\"I'm delighted to be here and have the opportunity to do that and help these boys.\"\n\nThe 32-year-old's last-gasp goal takes Celtic within a point of Rangers - who drew 1-1 at Motherwell - in second and closer to Hearts, while O'Neill's side carry that game in hand over both.\n\n\"Tonight is a great start for me, but more importantly keeps our goals alive and keeps us going in the right direction,\" Oxlade-Chamberlain added.\n\nHe says he leapt at the chance to move to Parkhead, with a wee push from his dad.\n\n\"It's an amazing opportunity. When it came up, I didn't doubt it for one second,\" he said.\n\n\"My dad's from an era where this club means a lot. He was straight away telling me 'I'll get you in the car and drive you up there myself'.\n\n\"It's a great start, but I know there's a lot more to it than 13 minutes.\"\n\nVisit our Celtic page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Celtic news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "fullText": "The 40-point mark - or thereabouts - could well be back in vogue when it comes to guaranteeing Premier League survival this term, with an in-form West Ham attempting to chase down the sides above them.\n\nThat mythical number has often been cited as the threshold at which managers, players and fans can relax - but the total has not actually been needed to stay up since 2010-11.\n\nPrior to that the only other occasions clubs were demoted with 40 points or more were 1996-97, 1997-98 and 2002-03.\n\nBut could that be about to change?\n\nWest Ham, who are 18th in the top flight, are only three points behind 17th-placed Nottingham Forest, while Tottenham - who sacked boss Thomas Frank on Wednesday - are 16th, another two points ahead of Forest.\n\nWith 12 games remaining history shows the Hammers are more than capable of surviving, and in Nuno Espirito Santo they have a manager who knows what it takes to stay up from his time at Forest.\n\nWest Ham's current points tally (24) is the most by any side in 18th at this stage of a campaign since 2019-20, when the Hammers recovered to stay up with 39 points.\n\nAnd they are arguably the form club in the lower reaches of the table, with three wins helping them take 10 points from their past five games.\n\nLeeds also look to have found some momentum with recent wins over Fulham and Forest as well as draws at Everton and Chelsea.\n\nIn contrast Spurs have managed a meagre four points from the previous 27 available to them.\n\nMeanwhile, Forest have won just two of their past 10 games and fans of Brighton and Crystal Palace may also be looking over their shoulders.\n\nThe 14th-placed Seagulls (31 points) are on a dismal run having won just one top-flight game since 30 November.\n\nPalace - who are a place and a point above Brighton - have only tasted victory once since 7 December and most recently let a two-goal lead slip as they lost to struggling Burnley.\n\nHad West Ham held on to beat Manchester United on Tuesday, they would have equalled the record for the best points tally by an 18th-placed side at this stage of a 38-game campaign.\n\nAs it is they are a solitary point better off than the average for teams in that position - and look likely to need more than the 36 points that has ensured safety in the past nine seasons.\n\nWest Ham hold the record for being relegated with the most points (42) in a 38-game season, going down in a dramatic conclusion to the 2002-03 campaign after drawing against Birmingham.\n\nThat year they took 22 points from their final 12 games - and they have history for finishing strongly.\n\nThis is the sixth Premier League campaign where West Ham have had as few as 24 points at this stage - in the previous five seasons, they survived three times.\n\nThe Hammers earned 15 points or more from their last 12 matches in 2006-07, 2019-20 and 2022-23 to stay up.\n\nIn only one of the previous five seasons have they gone down with a whimper by taking fewer than 15 points from their remaining 12 games (2010-11).\n\nThis year's fixture list has ensured another potentially gripping finale with Nuno's side ending their season at home to Leeds, who are presently six points clear of them.\n\nAnd should the Hammers continue their recent revival, that magic 40-point mark could well be needed once more to avoid dropping into the Championship.\n\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place",

    "description": "Sir Keir Starmer says comments by the businessman and Manchester United co-owner are \"offensive and wrong\".",
    "fullText": "Sir Keir Starmer has labelled comments about immigration made by billionaire Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe as \"offensive and wrong\".\n\nSir Jim, founder of one of the world's largest chemical companies, Ineos, told Sky News on Wednesday that the UK had been \"colonised by immigrants\" and suggested the prime minister was \"too nice\" to do \"difficult things\" to stabilise the country's economy.\n\nIn his rebuke on Wednesday evening, Sir Keir added that Britain was \"a proud, tolerant and diverse country\" and called on Sir Jim to apologise.\n\nA spokesperson for No 10 also called on the businessman to apologise, saying the comments \"play into the hands of those who want to divide our country\".\n\nThe BBC has approached Ineos and Manchester United for comment in regards to Sir Jim's remarks.\n\nSir Jim told the broadcaster: \"You can't have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in.\"\n\nHe added: \"I mean, the UK has been colonised. It's costing too much money.\n\n\"The UK has been colonised by immigrants, really, hasn't it? I mean, the population of the UK was 58 million in 2020, now it's 70 million. That's 12 million people.\"\n\nHowever, data from the Office for National Statistics estimates that the UK's population in mid-2025 was 69.4 million, compared with 66.7 million in mid-2020.\n\nSir Jim made the comments during an interview with Sky News' economic editor Ed Conway, on the fringes of the European Industry Summit in Antwerp, Belgium.\n\nThe remarks were also condemned by various fans groups, including the Manchester United Supporters Trust which said on X: \"No fan should feel excluded from following or supporting the club because of their race, religion, nationality or background. Comments from the club's senior leadership should make inclusion easier, not harder.\n\n\"This is not about politics; it is about ensuring that the custodians of Manchester United act in a way that unites supporters rather than marginalising any part of our fanbase.\"\n\nManchester United Muslim Supporters Club also said it was \"deeply concerned\" by the remarks, adding that the term colonised \"is not neutral\".\n\n\"It echoes language frequently used in far-right narratives that frame migrants as invaders and demographic threats,\" it added.\n\nShow Racism the Red Card said the cultural influence held by football clubs \"should be used to challenge racism, not inadvertently amplify narratives that undermine community harmony\", while Kick It Out said the comments were \"disgraceful and deeply divisive\".\n\nThe 1958 Group of Manchester United supporters described the comments as \"very ill-advised\", and criticised Sir Jim for \"commenting on the issues of our country while living in Monaco to avoid paying tax\".\n\nThe 73-year-old said politicians needed to be \"prepared to be unpopular for a period of time to get the big issues sorted out\".\n\nSir Jim has restructured United since acquiring a 27.7% stake in 2024, making 450 redundancies, overhauling senior management and sacking two managers.\n\nHe said that although some of his decisions had been unpopular, he had had to make them \"to get the big issues sorted out\".\n\n\"If you do difficult things, which we felt that we had to do at Manchester United... we felt like they were the right things to do. But you do become very unpopular for a while,\" said Sir Jim.\n\nHe added: \"But you've got all the same issues with the country. If you really want to deal with the major issues of immigration, with people opting to take benefits rather than working for a living, if you want to deal with that, then you're going to have to do some things which are unpopular, and show some courage.\"\n\nSpeaking about the prime minister, Sir Jim said: \"It's a tough job, and I think you have to do some difficult things with the UK to get it back on track.\"\n\nSir Jim said he had met Reform UK leader Nigel Farage recently, and described him as an \"intelligent man\" with \"good intentions\", but added that \"in a way, you could say exactly the same about Keir when Keir came in\".\n\n\"I think it needs somebody who's prepared to be unpopular for a period of time to get the big issues sorted out,\" he added.\n\nIn response to Sir Keir's condemnation of the comments, Farage said on X: \"Britain has undergone unprecedented mass immigration that has changed the character of many areas in our country.\n\n\"Labour may try to ignore that but Reform won't.\"\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described Sir Jim's comments as \"totally wrong\" and \"totally out of step with British values\", also calling on him to apologise.\n\nAccording to the Sunday Times' Rich List, Sir Jim, who was a Leave campaigner in the run-up to the Brexit referendum, was the 7th richest person in the UK in 2025, with a net worth of about £17bn.\n\nHe reportedly moved from the UK to Monaco in 2020, a place that does not collect personal income tax or capital gains taxes.\n\nIneos' raw materials are used in everything from packaging for toiletries, medicines and food, to mobile phones and furniture.\n\nIn recent years, Sir Jim's business interests have moved away from chemicals, including a discontinued plan to build a new vehicle based on the Land Rover Defender, as well as Ineos' purchase of luxury motorcycle wear brand Belstaff.",

    "fullText": "A Washington, DC, panel rejected Jeanine Pirro’s lame attempt to indict six Democratic Congresspersons merely for reminding military and intelligence officials to obey the law.\n\nThe entrance to the Supreme Court building announces “Equal Justice Under Law,” but it hasn’t felt like SCOTUS represented that American value for quite some time—roughly since Bush v. Gore in December 2000, even more so since gutting the Voting Rights Act in Shelby in 2013, and especially since the John Roberts court declared, in 2024, that the president is immune from punishment for “official acts,” even those demonstrably illegal, while in office.\n\nMeanwhile, an undersung underpinning to American justice has repeatedly emerged as the hero in this second, lawless Donald Trump administration: local grand juries, most famous for the slur that they’ll easily indict a ham sandwich. That was never (uniformly) true, but the low expectation of rigor has served to focus attention on the ways these ordinary citizens have courageously stood up to Trump when so many elites, including universities, law firms, the GOP Congress, and six of nine SCOTUS justices, have caved.\n\nThe most recent grand jury victory for democracy came late Tuesday afternoon, when a Washington, DC, panel refused to indict six Democratic Congresspersons, all military veterans, who recorded an ad reminding their military and intelligence community colleagues that they are not obliged to obey illegal orders from their superiors. The stirring ad, titled “Don’t Give Up the Ship,” merely repeated language common to US military training courses since World War II.\n\nThe FBI had been investigating all six: Senators Mark Kelly of Arizona and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, along with Representatives Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is conducting his own petty jihad against Kelly, formally censuring him and docking his retirement pay. “[Kelly] released a reckless and seditious video that was clearly intended to undermine good order and military discipline,” Hegseth claimed last month. The grand jury can’t undo Hegseth’s frat-boy grandstanding, but it protects all six from prosecution.\n\nProsecution on what grounds has never been clear. Trump immediately pronounced their move “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” Barely hinged Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro, now unbelievably serving as US Attorney in Washington, DC, approached the grand jury trying to argue that the lawmakers “violated a statute that forbids interfering with the loyalty, morale or discipline of the U.S. armed forces,” according to The New York Times.\n\nRemember that local grand juries also refused to indict the Subway sandwich-throwing hero, Sean Dunn, New York Attorney General Letitia James (twice), and multiple ICE observers outside Chicago’s Broadview detention facility.\n\nAfter the grand jury’s decision, Mark Kelly declared, “This is an outrageous abuse of power by Donald Trump and his lackeys. Trump wants every American to be too scared to speak out.”\n\nJason Crow went further: “If these fuckers think that they’re going to intimidate us and threaten and bully me into silence, and they’re going to go after political opponents and get us to back down, they have another thing coming. The tide is turning.”\n\nLet’s hope so. Attorney General Pam Bondi is testifying before the House Judiciary Committee Wednesday to answer questions about her lawless department. She should get some good ones. Maybe even from Republicans?",

    "fullText": "Pep Guardiola vowed his Manchester City side would \"breathe down the neck of Arsenal\" as they aim to hunt down the Premier League leaders in this fascinating title race.\n\nThey backed up Sunday's astonishing comeback victory at champions Liverpool by taking apart Fulham in the first half on Wednesday night.\n\nGuardiola's men have started to gain momentum and now trail the Gunners by just three points with an intriguing battle developing between the top two.\n\nMikel Arteta's side travel to tricky Brentford on Thursday hoping to regain their six-point advantage but go into the game under pressure knowing City did their job in style.\n\nGuardiola, though, was not getting drawn into title talk at this stage of the season, saying: \"We were not nine points [adrift] before Anfield, we are not three points [adrift] before Brentford v Arsenal, after that we will see.\n\n\"I always say the focus is to grow, grow, grow. It's how we can be more consistent over 90 minutes, how we can be better and the players feel that [they are] doing what we want to do.\n\n\"'We can do it in terms of mentality and patterns defensively and offensively. We are doing that.\"\n\nMan City beat Fulham to close to three points on Arsenal\n\nThe celebrations between a group of City players at full-time to preserve a clean sheet epitomised the togetherness that has been forged and the character they are able to display.\n\nThe result at Anfield appears to have given City and Guardiola renewed belief that they are capable of chasing down Arsenal, despite not being at their rampant best this season.\n\nCity have the know-how of getting the job done, having been top dogs in six of the past eight seasons, while Arsenal will be hoping there isn't a familiar story to the past three campaigns when they have finished runners-up.\n\nFormer Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given told BBC Radio Live: \"There are still fragilities we haven't seen in the past perhaps, but they still have the armoury I think to go on a crazy run now and be unbeaten and all that stuff.\n\n\"It's not that big of a statement to say that. The manner in which they won on Sunday, the psychological side. They have gone 'this is ours for the taking'.\n\n\"The belief runs through the whole club and fans where they think, 'do you know what, we still have a great chance'. That will give them belief for this run-in.\"\n\nEx-England striker Alan Shearer added on BBC Match of the Day: \"I don't think it would surprise many people if they went on a run. Particularly after the game at the weekend, you could see they were full of confidence, belief and energy.\n\n\"They have done their job tonight and put the pressure back on Arsenal with a three-point gap now.\"\n\nThe weight of expectation will lie heavily on Arsenal's shoulders before facing the Bees, with an uncomfortable night's sleep in store after seeing City take apart Fulham in a clinical first-half showing.\n\nBut Arsenal know they can respond by claiming three points at the G Tech Stadium and if they follow it up by beating bottom side Wolves next Wednesday, the tantalising prospect of a nine-point lead awaits.\n\nThe two sides meet in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday 22 March with the chance of inflicting the first direct psychological blow.\n\nRecent history shows that seven of the last 12 winners of the EFL Cup have gone on to win at least one other trophy in the same season, highlighting the importance of claiming the trophy at Wembley next month.\n\nThey are scheduled to meet at Etihad Stadium in the Premier League in April but the rivalry could see them face each other another three times if they progress in both the Champions League and FA Cup.\n\nWhile Arsenal did not sign anyone in the January transfer window, City added Antoine Semenyo, who has scored five goals already, and England international Marc Guehi, who contributed to a clean sheet.\n\nGuardiola said his side are \"growing\", adding: \"We were together, more calm with the ball, we made inside, outside [runs]. I would say the position was not perfect for Nico O'Reilly and Phil [Foden] but sometimes it happens to be in better positions, but in general really pleased.\n\n\"We suffered a lot at Fulham and today, after physically and emotionally at Anfield, it is really tricky but we talked a lot and I said 'guys we have to do it again' and we did it.\"\n\nA long and arduous season is bound to take its toll at some stage and star striker Erling Haaland could do with a rest.\n\nThe Norwegian scored in Wednesday's 3-0 win over Fulham to take his tally to 42 in as many games this season for club and country.\n\nThe 25-year-old, though, scored his first non-penalty league goal since 20 December against West Ham, ending a run of 24 shots from open play without scoring.\n\nBut he featured in only the first half against the Cottagers, being replaced by Omar Marmoush at half-time.\n\nGuardiola said the player was feeling some \"niggles\", adding: \"He [Haaland] said, 'I don't feel comfortable' and 3-0 [ahead] with a lot of games and having Omar, common sense [to subsititute him].",

He's bowling rapid and I'm sure he'll execute better in the coming games.\"\n\nEngland face Scotland on Saturday before their final Group C match against Italy on Monday, with both games taking place in Kolkata.",

    "description": "Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson miss out on becoming the first British figure skaters in 32 years to win an Olympic medal, as they fail to make the ice dance podium.",
    "fullText": "Lilah Fear said she could not believe the \"costly and devastating\" error she made which meant she and partner Lewis Gibson missed out on the ice dance medals at Milan-Cortina 2026.\n\nFear and Gibson finished seventh overall, meaning they failed to reach their goal of being the first British figure skaters in 32 years to win an Olympic medal.\n\nFear tripped on the second element of their free-dance routine, and despite skating cleanly for the remainder it proved too much of an obstacle to overcome.\n\nIt means the wait goes on for British skating since Dame Jayne Torvill and Sir Christopher Dean won bronze at the Lillehammer Games in 1994.\n\nAnd it continues Team GB's disappointing Games so far, with no medals won yet.\n\n\"I can't believe it happened,\" Fear said afterwards. \"I am replaying it in my head and it's just such a shame. I don't really have the words yet. It will take me some time to process.\"\n\nGold went to France's Guillaume Cizeron and Laurence Fournier Beaudry, who top scored across both rhythm and free dance. It is Cizeron's second successive Olympic gold after winning at Beijing 2022 with ex-partner Gabrielle Paparakis.\n\nCizeron and Fournier Beaudry have been at the centre of controversy in recent months, but have been the best couple in ice dance since partnering in November and outshone the competition in Milan.\n\nMadison Chock and Evan Bates of USA won silver, with bronze going to Canada's Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier. Fear and Gibson finished seventh.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nFear, 26, and 31-year-old Gibson were fourth after the rhythm dance – the first section of the ice dance competition - leaving them work to do. They scored 85.47 in their rhythm dance to lie behind Gilles and Poirier in third.\n\nIt meant Fear and Gibson needed to deliver a showstopping performance in their Scottish-themed free dance to earn Britain's first medal of the 2026 Winter Games.\n\nResplendent in tartan, they danced to The Bonnie Banks of Loch Lomond, Auld Lang Syne and The Proclaimers hit I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles) – in a routine they had honed with highland dance experts to perfect the choreography.\n\nAnd it started magnificently as they scored big on their complex opening, a multi-stage stationary lift.\n\nBut as they moved into their second element, sequential twizzles – a rotation while moving across the ice - Fear visibly wobbled. It meant they got a negative score on the grade of execution, a fatal blow in an Olympic final.\n\n\"It was just a really costly technical mistake, which was tough very early in the programme because I knew that we'd lost bronze at that point,\" Fear told BBC Sport.\n\n\"But I also really wanted to not let the Olympic experience just disappear because of that so it's this battle of taking it in and doing my best the rest of the way while also knowing what I'd just done.\n\n\"And it's not what we've trained, it was costly and devastating.\"\n\nThey skated clean thereafter and got good scores in their rousing finish – a series of Highland jigs combined with a dance lift - but the damage was done, as their overall technical score suffered greatly.\n\nIt was clear from their faces that they knew they had not been perfect. Fear had appeared nervous before the routine and looked devastated afterwards as it became clear that the pressure told.\n\n\"When you don't perform the way you want to, on any day, it's tough to take but at the Olympic Games, it's even harder,\" Gibson said.\n\n\"I think we'll look back at this one day and 100% learn from it. We do that at every single event that we go to and compete in. We'll just move forward.\"\n\nThe 'Disco Brits' are the darlings of British figure skating, and are popular internationally for their vibrant, skilful routines.\n\nAnd they have had an impressive year in which they became the first Brits to win a medal at a World Championship for 40 years; they also got on the podium in Sheffield at their home European Championships. But there will be no Olympic medal to round it off.\n\nBritain's other representatives Phebe Bekker and James Hernandez, who made the final stage on their Olympic debuts aged just 24 and 20 respectively, finished 17th after setting a season-best overall score of 179.45.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "title": "Frank's downfall: Inside his struggle to get players and fans onboard",
    "description": "Thomas Frank has been sacked as Tottenham manager after just eight months in charge. BBC Sport's Sami Mokbel takes a closer look at his tenure.",
    "fullText": "Tottenham's decision to sack Thomas Frank was made almost immediately after Tuesday night's loss to Newcastle.\n\nChief executive Vinai Venkatesham, in conjunction with sporting director Johan Lange, made the call - one the club had been reluctant to make.\n\nBut the sorry state of Tottenham's season meant not even Frank's biggest advocate could disagree with the decision.\n\nEarly on Wednesday morning, Venkatesham made the recommendation to the Lewis family - the club's ownership - to dispense with Frank.\n\nIn recent weeks a furious fanbase have directed their ire towards the Lewises amid a widely held belief that supporters' views about Frank were not being listened to.\n\nAccording to conversations with those closely connected with the ownership, that was not the case - and the Lewis family were attuned to the widespread discontent from Spurs fans.\n\nOf course, it would have been harder not to notice given the ferocity of ill feeling towards the Dane in recent weeks.\n\nBut given they effectively handed the running of the club to Venkatesham when appointing him chief executive last summer, it is fair to say the ownership have not sought to intervene - feeling a decision should be made 'on the ground'.\n\nSo, when the recommendation from Venkatesham to terminate Frank's employment arrived in the hours after the loss to Newcastle it was accepted immediately by the ownership board, who formally approved the decision.\n\nAll that was left was for Frank to be officially informed of his departure - a formality that took place on Wednesday morning in a meeting between the manager, Venkatesham and Lange.\n\nFrank's appointment in June was welcomed at the time as a shrewd move.\n\nHe had done a superb job at Brentford to, firstly, earn promotion from the Championship and then, crucially, consolidate their position as a Premier League club.\n\nBut he lasted just eight months at Spurs amid player indiscipline, a split executive team and doubts over his tactical approach.\n\nWhy Frank at Tottenham was a gamble that ended in bitter failure\n\nFrank sacked by Spurs after eight months in charge\n\nFrank was intent on implementing a positive culture at Tottenham - having done so at Brentford - which was one of the factors behind the decision to appoint him as Ange Postecoglou's successor.\n\nThere have been instances, however, when Frank's efforts to build respectful working conditions for his players and staff were tested.\n\nTowards the start of his reign, Frank dropped a player from Tottenham's starting XI after the squad member reported late for a pre-match meeting and then did not apologise for the indiscretion.\n\nHowever, after being removed from the team the player did later apologise.\n\nThe way Frank handled apparent threats to his authority ultimately impressed some players, who liked the fact there were consequences for below-par behaviour.\n\nAn example came when Yves Bissouma was left in London for August's Uefa Super Cup against Paris St-Germain because of persistent lateness.\n\nIn recent days, meanwhile, Frank had no intention of stripping Cristian Romero of the captaincy despite the defender's social media outbursts against the club or his red card against Manchester United.\n\nRomero is said to be more difficult to manage around the club's training centre, and it is claimed some players felt the Argentine has been afforded preferential treatment.\n\nWhen Micky van der Ven and Djed Spence appeared to refuse to shake Frank's hand after the home loss to Chelsea, the manager defused the situation by insisting the players were simply \"frustrated\" before later revealing they had apologised.\n\nThere was always a sense Frank put his players before his own agendas. Certain members of the squad certainly appreciated that.\n\nBut that is not to say he left a positive impression on all of them.\n\nIn the opening weeks of his reign, some players are believed to have found Frank indecisive.\n\nThey were used to Postecoglou's big personality - although the Australian had become increasingly isolated during his final months in charge.\n\nThere were consistent reservations about Frank's tactical approach, too: concerns he was not assertive enough in matches and was too focused on adapting to the opposition rather than imposing Spurs' own strengths.\n\nThat image of Frank will do little to dispel the narrative the Tottenham job was simply too big for him.\n\nConcerns over Frank's appointment have been lingering for months.\n\nOne leading executive recommended the Dane should be sacked after the 2-1 home defeat by Fulham on 29 November - Tottenham's third-straight loss after reversals to Arsenal and PSG.\n\nFormer Brighton head coach Roberto de Zerbi - who was managing Marseille at the time - was also pushed as a potential replacement.\n\nBut that recommendation was rejected with the club continuing to put their faith in Frank.\n\nIt is interesting that the club's leadership group, led by Venkatesham, stuck with Frank for as long as they did.\n\nThe Dane's appointment was ultimately led by Daniel Levy - Tottenham's divisive former executive chairman who unexpectedly departed after 24 years in September.\n\nWhile Venkatesham was involved in the execution of the deal that took Frank across London, the groundwork was completed in advance of the CEO joining last summer.\n\nWith Levy gone, it appeared the easiest decision for Venkatesham would be to sack Frank given the increasing vitriol towards the head coach from fans.\n\nBut for Venkatesham, it was not as simple as that, despite the fact he knew it could increase his popularity.\n\nFor starters, Lange - who played a key role in Frank's identification as a leading candidate - was a close ally of his Danish compatriot.\n\nHowever, it is also true to say Tottenham's former co-sporting director Fabio Paratici, who has since joined Fiorentina, was not overly convinced Frank was the best man for the job.\n\nBut there is also a sense during the post-Levy era at Spurs that after years of chopping and changing managers they would benefit from a period of stability.\n\nVenkatesham saw first-hand at Arsenal what sticking with a manager when there are calls for his head can do for a club in Mikel Arteta, who has since established the Gunners as one of the best teams in Europe.\n\nLikewise, there was a belief from within Tottenham's hierarchy that Frank had been dealt a rough hand given the campaign has been disrupted by injuries to key players.\n\nThere is also recognition that the squad needs repair work – particularly considering the departures of their two main sources of goals in Harry Kane and Son Heung-min.\n\nLast season's top scorer Brennan Johnson has also left - although that was down to Frank deeming the Wales attacker was no longer part of his plans.\n\nThere is also a sense Tottenham's squad is lacking in leadership. It was why they signed England midfielder Conor Gallagher and tried to land Andy Robertson - both of whom have vast Premier League experience.\n\nUltimately, the foundations of Tottenham's faith in Frank were irreparably shaken after the home loss to relegation-threatened West Ham on 17 January.\n\nSources have suggested Spurs were close to ending Frank's reign after that defeat, which was attended by members of the Lewis family - Vivienne Lewis was confronted by an irate fan after the match.\n\nChampions League victories over Borussia Dortmund and Eintracht Frankfurt bought Frank some time - but the loss to Newcastle extended Tottenham's winless league run to eight matches and proved to be the Dane's last.\n\nVenkatesham and the club's new leadership team will now be tasked with making their first appointment.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether they seek an interim manager with a view to appointing a permanent boss in the summer, or want a full-time choice immediately.\n\nThere is certainly consideration behind the scenes to the interim option given how drastically the managerial landscape will change in the summer.\n\nOne option until the end of the season could be John Heitinga, who joined Tottenham as an assistant coach last month. The former Netherlands defender managed Ajax this season and was part of Arne Slot's Premier League title-winning coaching staff at Liverpool.\n\nFor the long term, the most obvious development will be the potential availability of Mauricio Pochettino after the World Cup.\n\nThe USA head coach has made no secret of his desire to return to Tottenham one day - and supporters have made no secret of their wishes for him to return.\n\nIt seems like a perfect match. But Spurs will have to wait until after the World Cup to appoint Pochettino.\n\nEven if it is not Pochettino, the likes of Oliver Glasner, Andoni Iraola and Marco Silva will be available for nothing in the summer.\n\nOther World Cup coaches including Thomas Tuchel, Carlo Ancelotti and Julian Nagelsmann may also be obtainable.\n\nSo there is sense in buying time until the summer. Equally, however, the recent availability of De Zerbi, who left Marseille on Tuesday night, may interest Spurs.\n\nDe Zerbi is viewed as someone who can hit the ground running, a trait Tottenham could do with given their spiral towards the relegation zone.\n\nYes, he can be combustible. But if Spurs are looking for an instant impact, the Italian could fit the bill.\n\nSources are indicating Tottenham want an appointment in place by the time the players arrive back on Monday after a pre-planned five-day break.\n\nAmid on-field troubles, there have also been off-field rumours for the club's hierarchy to deal with - amid persistent rumblings Spurs could be sold.\n\nThis is despite it being reinforced to staff that Tottenham are not for sale. That correlates with public messaging despite industry rumours the Lewis family are open to selling.\n\nFormer Newcastle owner Amanda Staveley has been heavily linked with a continued interest in Tottenham despite a statement in September that she does not intend to make a formal offer for the club.\n\nOther consortiums, including groups from the USA, have also been linked with an interest in purchasing Spurs, while there were reports last week that Levy was looking at selling his stake in Tottenham after his departure.\n\nCombined with the results on the pitch and the changes off it, it has been an uncertain time.\n\nFor now though, all the attention is on the dugout and how Tottenham replace Frank.\n\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Tottenham - what do you want to know?",
