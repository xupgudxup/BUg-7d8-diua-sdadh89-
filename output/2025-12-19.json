    "fullText": "Lakers face Luka Doncic-LeBron James crossroads after JJ Redick's latest on-court experiment originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers pulled off one of the most groundbreaking trades just before the deadline last February. Acquiring Luka Dončić was one of the most shocking deals in NBA history. While the Lakers want to build around him—and understand that it may take time—Dončić still wants to win now.\n\n“Dončić being just 26 gives the Lakers a far longer timeline to build a championship-contending team, but that doesn't mean they can slow down and take their time. Dončić told Lakers president Rob Pelinka and coach JJ Redick in May that he's not interested in taking the slow approach in building a contender,” CBS Sports’ Jasmyn Wimbish wrote.\n\nLos Angeles got off to a hot start, but lately the team has become stagnant. Defense has been a major reason for that struggle. As a result, head coach JJ Redick reportedly called a meeting with Dončić and LeBron James, challenging them to step up on that end of the floor.\n\n“It was good. We talked about a lot - not just that. But he was right. You got to get a little bit more, especially from the star players. So that’s on us, that’s on me.” - Luka Dončić on JJ Redick’s recent meeting where he asked for more on the defensive end from him and LeBron,” Lakers insider Dave McMenamin posted.\n\nIt also appears that Redick is working to get Dončić more involved off the ball.\n\n“JJ just inferred that he's been trying to get Luka to play more off-ball, but he's been reluctant and uncomfortable. However he made some progress in that regard today. If Luka learns how to play off-ball, even a 10% increase would make the Lakers so much more dangerous,” Lakers Daily posted.\n\nWhile getting Dončić involved off the ball could benefit the offense, it may also signal that Redick is still searching for the best way to keep all of his stars engaged. LeBron James has yet to have a truly dominant game, and that could be due in part to not having the ball in his hands as often.\n\nRedick now appears to be at a crossroads as he works to maximize his roster. This is his current solution, but if Dončić is unwilling to fully embrace the change, the offense could suffer. If these issues aren’t addressed soon, they could quickly become a significant problem.",

This is the process we are doing.

    "fullText": "Liverpool head to Tottenham this weekend carrying momentum, but also a growing sense of uncertainty that has caught the attention of one of the game’s most prominent voices. Speaking ahead of the trip to north London, Neville openly questioned whether Liverpool currently possess the authority and consistency required to win one of the Premier League’s most demanding away fixtures.\n\nThe Reds arrive in good form on paper, unbeaten in their last four league matches and fresh from a controlled victory over Brighton. Yet this fixture, against a Tottenham side unpredictable but dangerous at home, has divided opinion among pundits and supporters alike. Neville’s remarks crystallise a broader debate about where Liverpool truly stand at this stage of the season.\n\nNeville’s assessment was notable for its honesty rather than its certainty. He admitted difficulty in calling the outcome, initially leaning towards a draw before posing the central question: can Liverpool go there and win?\n\nThat hesitation speaks volumes. Tottenham’s home form has been erratic, but the fixture has historically been uncomfortable for visiting sides. For Liverpool, this match represents more than just three points. It is a barometer of progress under Arne Slot, whose side has prioritised control and structure over relentless dominance.\n\nNeville eventually shifted his stance towards a narrow Liverpool victory, though the lack of conviction remained clear. His uncertainty echoed the wider panel discussion, with predictions ranging from high-scoring draws to a tight away win. Such variation underlines how finely balanced this contest appears.\n\nLiverpool’s recent performances have been solid rather than spectacular. The win over Brighton was efficient, marked by defensive discipline and a composed display in possession. However, questions persist about whether that level translates seamlessly against elite opposition away from home.\n\nUnder Slot, Liverpool are showing signs of stability, but not yet the ruthless edge that once defined their peak years. The side is conceding fewer clear chances and managing games more effectively, yet moments of hesitation and missed opportunities have prevented them from pulling away from rivals in decisive fashion.\n\nThis is where Neville’s scepticism finds its footing. Tottenham, for all their flaws, remain capable of exploiting lapses, particularly in transition. Liverpool’s ability to maintain focus for the full ninety minutes will be critical.\n\nTottenham’s strengths and weaknesses make them a unique opponent. Their aggressive approach can leave space, but it also places immense physical and mental demands on visiting teams. For Liverpool, coping with that intensity while imposing their own game plan is the real test.\n\nJamie Carragher pointed to Tottenham’s struggles on home soil as a reason for optimism, while others predicted a goal-heavy draw. What is clear is that Liverpool will need more than control; they will need conviction.\n\nA positive result would reinforce the sense that Liverpool are edging towards something more substantial under Slot. A draw or defeat, however, would keep doubts alive and lend weight to Neville’s question.\n\nMatches like this often define seasons. Liverpool have the chance to send a message, not only to Tottenham but to the wider league, that their upward trajectory is real. Winning away against a direct rival would provide tangible proof of growth.\n\nNeville’s comments should be viewed less as criticism and more as a challenge. Liverpool have the tools, the form and the platform. What remains to be seen is whether they have the authority to impose themselves when the spotlight is brightest.\n\nSunday’s clash will not decide the title race, but it may shape perceptions. For Liverpool, that alone makes the trip to Tottenham unmissable.",

An academy player, who is a part of the Castilla setup currently, the teenage defender made his debut with the first team last Sunday at Mendizorroza against Alaves.\n\nThe 19-year-old talent started as the left-back for Real Madrid last weekend due to the absences of Alvaro Carreras and Fran Garcia through suspension, while Ferland Mendy was unavailable through injury.\n\nWith Carreras and Garcia ruled out against Sevilla as well and Mendy unlikely to return, Valdepenas could once again start for Real Madrid on Saturday night.\n\nNow, according to Mundo Deportivo, Real Madrid will improve the contract of Valdepenas by increasing his salary due to his good performances.\n\nThis was already planned even before his official first-team debut last Sunday at Mendizorroza. The length of his contract will not be changed and continues to run until 2029.\n\nValdepenas made his debut vs Alaves. (Photo by Juan Manuel Serrano Arce/Getty Images)\n\nValdepenas is considered one of the biggest prospects currently coming through the Real Madrid academy.\n\nThe versatile defender has played in 13 of the 16 league matches this season for Castilla, scoring and assisting one goal apiece. In addition, he has scored a goal from two UEFA Youth League matches and even featured once in the U21 Premier League International Cup.\n\nApart from having made his first-team debut, Valdepenas has also been included in the squad for the Champions League game vs Manchester City and the Copa del Rey clash against Talavera.\n\nGiven his talent and potential, Real Madrid will improve the versatile defender’s salary as a reward for his strong performances with Castilla.\n\nLast summer, clubs such as Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen and Arsenal made enquiries about Valdepenas and remain interested. It could be a factor behind Real Madrid offering him an improved deal.",

    "fullText": "Barcelona president Joan Laporta has hit back at Real Madrid and Florentino Perez with some harsh words in a pre-Christmas speech.\n\nPerez went on the attack earlier this week, calling the Negreira Case the ‘biggest scandal in football,’ and also criticising La Liga referees once again.\n\nLaporta how now responded with strong very strong words and made his disdain for Los Blancos crystal clear.\n\n“They are the ones who confuse power with despotism. They are the ones who practice cynicism and disproportionate arrogance. They are the ones who have a disgraceful television program that only spews lies and constantly and permanently poisons the atmosphere. To them I say that Barça is strong again, both on and off the pitch,” he said.\n\n“The size we have generates an envy that is poorly handled by these people who, with underhanded tactics, disregard all codes of conduct, ethical and moral, and not just sporting ones, I mean in general.\n\n“I imagine you know who I am referring to, those who are the architects of permanent campaigns to discredit our badge and our essence, and we will not allow this.”\n\nLaporta also said that Madrid’s regular attacks will not harm Barcelona as he looked forward to a bright future for the club.\n\n“Together we know that in every sporting, social, institutional and even economic action we leave our mark, as a respected, recognized, admired and beloved club,” he added.\n\n“While they destroy and try to erase or distort history, they will not succeed. We are building, and we are building a glorious new chapter in Barça’s history that will once again reach glory and make history, and this is thanks to you, fundamentally.”",

    "description": "Lewis Steele provided insight into a wide array of subjects in a Q&A.",
    "fullText": "The Daily Mail’s Lewis Steele conducted a wide-ranging Q&A on Liverpool FC, covering transfers, contract renewals, and more. Let’s comb through the highlights.\n\nOn a potential Antoine Semenyo transfer, he had this to say:\n\n“Semenyo was certainly one that was talked about at Anfield at the start of the summer window. Now the only problem is there’s so many teams that are in for him.”\n\n“Can’t read it too much, but he gave tickets to his old friends for old Trafford game on Monday.”\n\n“But I think if Liverpool really wanted to do this sign and they could. And I think that with all due respect to Tottenham and Man United, I think if you’ve got them free in front of you, you choose Liverpool.”\n\nFor Marc Guehi, and if the transfer will happen, and if it’ll happen in January or the summer:\n\n“I still think Liverpool have a really good chance of signing Guehi. The only question is, is that in January for a fee or is that in the summer for nothing?”\n\n“I think Guehi himself would rather it be in the summer. He’s playing in Europe for the 1st time with Crystal Palace, I think he feels a bit of a loyalty to not leave midseason and also if he leaves on a free, then he gets good money in terms of the wages.”\n\n“Liverpool aren’t the only team in for him, we know Bayern Munich is sniffing around. Manchester City, Real Madrid would like to have a go as well.”\n\n“But I just wonder whether there’s a sort of under the table, gentlemen’s agreement between Liverpool and Guehi, from September the 1st or whatever date it was, because they were literally that close to him signing.”\n\n“I think Liverpool have every chance. The word from the club may be caution over a January transfer, but on August the 30th, the word from the club was not going to sign Alexander Isak and look what happened there.”\n\n“So I think Liverpool have every chance of getting him in January. If not, the summer.”\n\nSteele was also asked about the murmurs that have been circulating about Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton:\n\n“Nothing imminent. I can’t see Liverpool signing a midfielder in January. But I think Adam Wharton certainly has his admirers at Anfield, and he could be one to watch for the summer.”\n\nHarvey Elliott’s bizarre loan to Aston Villa, where he hasn’t played since October, was also addressed:\n\n“The clubs could shake hands in January on terminating the loan agreement, it doesn’t really benefit anyone.”\n\nWhen asked if Arne Slot was frustrated by the failure of recruitment to get any transfer deal over the line, Steele said:\n\n“I don’t think there’s any frustration from Slot. It’s easy to say in hindsight, but I think Slot was perfectly happy with the window. “\n\nOn contract renewals, Ibrahima Konaté’s situation doesn’t seem to have changed much, even with Real Madrid pulling out of the race to sign him:\n\n“Konate and Liverpool have been in talks over a new deal for nearly 18 months. So far, they have been very far apart.”\n\n“We haven’t really ever heard from Konate whether he actually is all in on wanting to stay at Liverpool. Although interest from Madrid has become weaken, PSG would always appeal to him for his nationality, I’m sure that they would maybe consider it if they got some encouragement, but as of yet, it does seem more likely than not that he would be at Liverpool.”\n\n“I don’t think that Liverpool would be removing any contract offering.”\n\nAlso on contract renewals, early talks have begun for key midfielders Dominik Szoboszlai, Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister:\n\n“There are talks underway, very preliminary talk, but I think Liverpool are keen to extend all 3 of those deals.”\n\nLast but not least, Steele answered some questions about the status of some squad members, including injured players, and the ones on the periphery of the squad. For Jeremie Frimpong, who is nearing a return:\n\n“Very, very soon. Maybe not quite ready to play at the weekend, but I think he’ll be back in full training in the next couple of days, certainly in the next week, he’s been back in the grass for a while now doing some 1v1 gym stuff as well.”\n\nSteele had a very interesting answer concerning Federico Chiesa, and his inability to get any starts:\n\n“Slot, wouldn’t mind me saying it, just doesn’t seem like he trusts him(Chiesa). That’s just a guess that I got because I know when they lost at Plymouth, Slot was furious with Chiesa. He was one of the senior players on that day and he just didn’t seem to (perform), a few people have said how frustrated Slot was.”\n\n“I just think what Chiesa has to do is,to prove to Arne Slot that he deserves a chance because if you lose in every game, you can’t get a game. Then you sort of think that maybe he doesn’t like him at all.“\n\nIt seems to me like Chiesa could come off the bench and score every week. He still wouldn’t play.”\n\nThe Plymouth game stuck out in my mind for a while after it happened, but he’s had so many key moments after that so it’s bizarre. But I’m also not a professional football coach so…\n\nOn the status of Stefan Bajcetic and Jayden Danns, who are working their way back from surgeries:\n\n“Stefan Bajcetic has been back on the grass at certain points of the last month.And I think the plan is to maybe get him into U21 for a bit. Jayden Danns is also stepping up his recovery. “\n\nWell, that was a buffet of information. Liverpool play Tottenham Hotspur next on Saturday in North London. Up the Reds.",

    "fullText": "Heading into Thursday night, the Golden State Warriors were riding a two-game losing streak. In each game, the Warriors held a lead in the fourth quarter, but struggled down the stretch on the way to losses.\n\nOn Thursday against the Phoenix Suns, the Warriors failed to close again, despite a heroic performance from Jimmy Butler. Behind Butler, the Warriors built a seven-point lead at halftime, yet heading into the fourth quarter, their lead dwindled down to one.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the Suns took control as momentum swung their way. Yet, Butler, Steph Curry and the Warriors wouldn't go away. In the final minute, the Suns led by five points before Dillon Brooks committed a flagrant foul on Curry, sending him to the line for a pair of free throws. After the free throws from Curry, Butler knocked down a clutch 3-pointer to tie the game at 96. After Booker and Curry traded buckets to tie the game again at 98, Moses Moody committed a late foul on Jordan Goodwin in the final second of the game. Goodwin missed the first attempt from the line before hitting the game-winning free throw and dealt the Warriors their third straight loss, 99-98.\n\nButler finished with a game-high 31 points on 11-of-17 shooting from the field with three assists and three rebounds in 34 minutes. Butler's performance on Thursday night in Phoenix was his third game of the season scoring 30 or more points. Thursday also marked his highest scoring mark in a month.\n\nAlongside Butler, Brandin Podziemski put together a strong performance on Thursday, scoring 18 points on 8-of-11 shooting from the field with a pair of made 3-pointers in 28 minutes off the bench.\n\nWhile Podziemski and Butler helped fuel Golden State's offense, Steph Curry struggled, scoring 15 points on 3-of-13 shooting from the field and 2-of-9 from deep. Butler, Podziemski and Curry were the only members of the Warriors to tally double-figure scoring numbers. Draymond Green committed five of Golden State's 20 turnovers.\n\nAfter their third straight loss, the Warriors have fallen to 13-15 on the season. The Warriors will get the chance to avenge their loss from Thursday when the Suns travel back to the Bay Area on Saturday for a rematch at Chase Center.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Warriors Wire! \n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Late free throws from Suns helps deal Warriors' third straight loss",

    "fullText": "Alarm bells started ringing within the halls of Manchester United when the recent interview of Bruno Fernandes began airing.\n\nThe club captain hinted at INEOS being open to the idea of letting him leave in the summer, but Ruben Amorim and the midfielder’s family asked the 31-year-old to stay put.\n\nThe co-owners were not pleased with the revelation, and plenty of players in the squad feel the Portugal international might be playing at Old Trafford for the final season.\n\nSaudi Pro League sides are expected to return once the summer window opens, while European clubs are also keeping a watch on proceedings.\n\nHowever, Bruno Fernandes has come out and allayed those fears, claiming he still feels he can win it all for United. And he also revealed that INEOS are also on the same page.\n\nAnd the 31-year-old feels obligated to help return the club to the heights the fans used to experience almost year back when Sir Alex Ferguson was boss.\n\n“Obviously, when I speak about going and winning trophies, I stayed here because I think I still can win trophies here,” he told on Rio Ferdinand’s podcast.\n\n“I wouldn’t have stayed here if the club hasn’t told me our aim is still to get the highest we can be, get back to winning trophies, get back to be the club we were before.\n\n“Because if that was not the aim then, yes, I wouldn’t have stayed here.\n\n“But [it’s] because I know the aim of the club is still to get back to where they want to be, and where I want the club to be, and that’s why I came to the club in the first place.\n\n“So, if I can help to get back there, that’s all I want to do.”\n\nUnited are currently sixth, only two points from fourth position. Returning to the Champions League should be the first step to realising those dreams.\n\nFeature image Shaun Botterill via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "FC Barcelona face off against an injury-riddled Villarreal away at Estadio La Ceramica in their final La Liga clash before the mid-season Christmas break.\n\nThe contest will take place on Sunday evening, with Barça hoping to go into the break on a winning note, with their healthy lead at the top of the league table intact.\n\nLeading up to the game, SPORT reports that Barcelona manager Hansi Flick is set to make some changes to the team’s pre-match routine before facing Villarreal.\n\nIn the build-up to La Liga matches, whether played at home or away, Barcelona usually follow the same routine. A morning training session at 11 am is held, followed by a press conference from Flick to address the media at 1 pm.\n\nIn the Champions League, there are usually some changes, as the structure and organisation of the competition require it.\n\nHansi Flick has changed things with Barcelona’s pre-match routine. (Photo by Alex Caparros/Getty Images)\n\nHowever, ahead of the final league match of the year, which Barcelona will play at La Ceramica against Villarreal this Sunday, the schedule will also be slightly different.\n\nThe training session, normally held in the morning, will be moved to the afternoon, taking place immediately after the German tactician’s press conference, which will take place at its usual time.\n\nThe reason for this change is that, once the training session at the Ciutat Esportiva has finished, the team will board a plane to spend Saturday night in the province of Castellon.\n\nBarcelona face the Yellow Submarine at 4:15 pm on Sunday, a kick-off time which, in order to avoid any setbacks, requires the squad to travel a day earlier.\n\nAs a result, the final training session has also been moved to the afternoon, before the team begin their journey to Villarreal.",

    "description": "Here are the options that Missouri football could explore at quarterback in the transfer portal.",
    "fullText": "Missouri football is almost certainly going to turn to the transfer portal for a quarterback. A team spokesperson confirmed to the Columbia Daily Tribune on Thursday that starting quarterback Beau Pribula intends to transfer this offseason. The college football transfer portal officially opens Jan. 2.\n\nNow, Mizzou doesn’t necessarily need a starter. Talented true freshman Matt Zollers is going to start for the Tigers against Virginia in the Gator Bowl on Dec. 27 in Jacksonville, Florida, for his third start with the program.\n\nMissouri may well stick with Zollers moving forward.\n\nBut, at the very least, depth is an issue in Columbia heading into 2026. Zollers and incoming true freshman Gavin Sidwar are the only scholarship quarterbacks currently expected to be on the roster next season.\n\nMizzou definitely needs depth. It might want a starter.\n\nHere are nine players who are currently expected to enter the transfer portal, with three players we think could come in and be instant starters, three would likely be competition and three who likely would be depth behind Zollers:\n\nThe following players are the current high-profile options expected to enter the portal. The expectation would be that they could arrive and immediately start.\n\nThe general consensus appears to be that Sorsby, if not NFL-bound, is making his way to Lubbock, Texas, to join the big-spending Texas Tech Red Raiders. That shouldn’t dissuade teams looking for a starter, like Mizzou. The Denton, Texas, native threw for 2,800 yards, 27 touchdowns and five picks this season and also rushed for 580 yards and nine scores.\n\nEveryone and their dog expects Mestemaker to follow his head coach, Eric Morris, from North Texas to Oklahoma State when the portal opens. But … it’s not quite so cut and dry, according to a report from Matt Zenitz at 247Sports. If there’s a window to try and land Mestemaker, there’s an FBS-leading 4,129 passing yards and 31 touchdowns worth of a reason to enter the bidding war.\n\nThis is an expensive option. The demand will be extremely high for the former five-star prospect. But, he’s in the portal and has a high ceiling, so he’s certainly worth considering. He threw for 2,000 yards, 18 touchdowns and six interceptions this season.\n\nMore: Matt Zollers, big-name transfer or other for Missouri football at QB?\n\nAlways compete, as the coaches say. Interest will be high in these players, and Mizzou could offer a chance to come in and battle with Zollers for the starting job.\n\nJoseph had an excellent season at ODU and fits the recent Mizzou mold of a dual-threat. He threw for 2,624 yards, 24 touchdowns and 10 picks, and he added 1,007 rushing yards with 13 touchdowns.\n\nThe former Michigan State quarterback beat out former Mizzou player Jake Garcia for the starting job at ECU and had a bit of a comeback year in 2025. He threw for 3,300 yards, 19 touchdowns and six picks, and his offensive coordinator has since been hired as the playcaller at Ole Miss.\n\nUnlikely to be starters, but solid or intriguing depth pieces that shouldn’t run the risk of running Zollers off.\n\nDickens is a finalist for the Walter Payton Award, which is given to the most outstanding offensive player at the FCS level. He threw for 3,508 yards, 38 touchdowns and two interceptions this season — in nine games. He passed for more yards (582) in a game against Stanford than Texas A&M had total offensive yards (478) against the Bulldogs this year. Worth a look, surely.\n\nCraig has a lot of experience at the FCS level with Harvard, with 28-career games, more than 6,000 passing yards, 52-career touchdowns and 12 interceptions. He has one year of eligibility left.\n\nMore: What Missouri football fans need to know about new transfer portal dates\n\nMore: Will Jamal Roberts return to Missouri football? Eli Drinkwitz makes plea\n\nMaybe we’re prisoners of the Trinidad Chambliss moment, but Stokes is a Harlon Hill finalist — the Division-II equivalent of the Heisman Trophy — and put up some some big passing numbers for Division-II West Florida. He threw for 3,297 yards, 30 touchdowns and 13 picks.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Columbia Daily Tribune: Here are Missouri football’s current transfer portal QB options",

    "description": "Commanders coach Dan Quinn hinted at his earlier disappointment in Brandon Coleman, but loves how he has responded ahead of his start vs. Eagles.",
    "fullText": "Seeing Laremy Tunsil has clearly been the Washington Commanders' MVP this season, with his effective play. What does his absence mean for the Eagles' game at Northwest Stadium, Saturday at 5 p.m. ET?\n\nBrandon Coleman, who had started the season at left guard, then lost his job to Chris Paul, was forced into action replacing Tunsil last Sunday in New York. It was the second time for Coleman to take over for Tunsil. He was also Tunsil's replacement against Kansas City when Tunsil went down with a hamstring injury.\n\n\"I think it's really important and the identity piece,\" head coach Dan Quinn said on Thursday. \"And that's what these three weeks are, to me, and why having three division games is so important for us to recapture that north. Yeah, Laremy has been a big part of everything. Run game, pass protection, and so his ability to displace people from the line down on double teams, and Brandon, I thought, really, he had been ready, he was ready, he looked ready, you know, and performed that way.\"\n\nQuinn was asked what he had seen from Coleman over the past few weeks. Here is how Quinn responded. Let's see if you think Quinn was saying he was initially disappointed that Coleman didn't win back that spot from Chris Paul.\n\n\"Yeah, and that's the one spot we haven't been banged up on in that space. And so, obviously disappointed when Chris stepped in and stayed into that space.\"\n\nThe Commanders' head coach then praised the fact that Coleman had been asked to play guard and tackle and had been productive as an extra tight end in some sets. \"But then I also saw a guy working guard and tackle. He’s been our jumbo, you know, so there's some things like, ‘Hey, let's get him back in the fight, get him back into it.'\"\n\nDaniels to Noah Brown at the goal line - but LOOK at the block by the rookie Brandon Coleman here 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻 pic.twitter.com/MDjuHb2f5i\n\n— Mark Tyler (Hogs Haven) (@Tiller56) September 24, 2024\n\nReferring to getting Coleman back into it, well, weren't the Commanders designating Coleman a healthy inactive scratch? They certainly did for five consecutive games, and the only comment they offered was that it was a coach's decision, not an injury-related one.\n\nYet on Thursday, Quinn expressed that he has recently liked the work he has seen from Coleman. \"I saw good practice habits number one. So, I wasn't surprised that he performed well because this wasn't a guy that put his head down and sulked about it.\"\n\nCoaches make decisions that players sometimes understand and sometimes don't, so it can be frustrating for the players. \"It's not always smooth, but I thought that showed a lot about his resilience to say, ‘Okay, yeah, these are not the circumstances that I want, but I'm going to go battle for it.'\"\n\nTo truly be ready when your name is called, a player must do the classroom work, the field work, and be prepared. Quinn feels Coleman has done just that. \"When called or if called, he would show and demonstrate that he was ready... You have to put the work in to do that. And I've certainly seen that from BC.\"\n\nColeman has played in nine games this season. Saturday will be his first start since the first two games of the season against the Giants and Packers. In both of those games, he was the starting left guard.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Brandon Coleman has massive Week 16 opportunity",

    "description": "YouTuber-turned-boxer Paul and former world heavyweight champion Joshua will clash on 19 December",
    "fullText": "Jake Paul and Anthony Joshua will square off in a strange fight tonight, pitting a YouTuber-turned-boxer against a former two-time world heavyweight champion.\n\nJoshua is the latter, to avoid any confusion, with the Briton entering Friday’s fight in Miami as a huge favourite. “AJ” holds standout victories over the likes of Wladimir Klitschko, Joseph Parker, Kubrat Pulev, Dillian Whyte and Alexander Povetkin. However, the 36-year-old is entering this bout, which streams live on Netflix, on the back of a brutal stoppage loss to Daniel Dubois in September 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, Paul comes into this contest – a professional bout, with knockouts allowed and standard 10oz gloves in use – with a 12-1 pro record. The American, 28, last fought in June and outpointed former world middleweight champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr, following a decision win over heavyweight legend Mike Tyson last November.\n\nTyson was 58 at the time, with the fight proving controversial to fans and pundits but lucrative to the boxers; Paul reportedly took home $40m and Tyson $20m.\n\nNow, Paul and Joshua will seemingly clear even Paul’s payday from that bout – and by some distance.\n\nIn the days leading up to the confirmation of this bout in November, the Daily Mail reported, “Sources tell us that a gargantuan prize pot of around £140m [$184m] has been mooted,” seemingly to be split evenly between Joshua and Paul. However, Paul later took to X (formerly Twitter) with a different figure, seemingly referencing the fight purse.\n\nSeveral days after the Mail’s report was published, Paul tweeted: “Stop asking me. $267 Million.” That works out at approximately £200m.\n\nSports and entertainment accountant Oriana Morrison told The Independent on Tuesday: “Even if the lower figure – the rumoured $184m purse – is true, AJ could bring home $92m [£70m]. We haven’t seen a boxing match with a purse at this level since Mayweather vs Pacquiao in 2015 or even Mayweather vs McGregor in 2017. It’s higher than any Saudi purse to date.”\n\nMorrison, who was referencing Floyd Mayweather’s bouts with Manny Pacquiao and Conor McGregor, continued: “The US never really got the chance to savour Anthony Joshua’s talent and charisma. This is the perfect setting for this fight and definitely a turning point for boxing in the US.\n\n“MVP [Most Valuable Promotions, Paul’s company] and Jake Paul are dragging new audiences into boxing. They’re forcing boxing to modernise its promotion and pay fighters better than established promoters.”",

    "description": "Joe Tiller took his Boilermakers on a trip to Pasadena, California, several years before they eventually made the Rose Bowl. More on that foundational moment:",
    "fullText": "Editor's note: This story is the third in a series related to Purdue's 2000 football season.\n\nIt's Sept. 13, 2025, a date several members of Purdue football's 2000 Big Ten championship team had eagerly awaited for weeks.\n\nThe Boilermakers are hosting USC and, for a bunch of guys who last suited up for the Boilermakers more than two decades earlier, this is a full circle moment.\n\nThe two programs hadn't played since the 1998 season opener in Los Angeles.\n\nPurdue lost that game 27 years ago, but what many who were there remember is the day after. Coach Joe Tiller had a planned field trip the players weren't looped in about.\n\n\"This was way out of the norm for coach Tiller. He was football, strictly business,\" safety Ben Smith said. \"For him to, one, not make us fly back after the game and, two, take us to the Rose Bowl, we had no idea where we were going.\n\n\"We show up there and there’s the neon lights. He gave us the old coach fire up talk and said, 'Guys, I want you to go out there and feel the grass, look in the stands. I want you to go in the press box and walk around this place and envision before you’re done playing here, playing in the Rose Bowl.'\"\n\nTwo years later, Tiller's Boilermakers finished in a three-way tie for the Big Ten title and were the league's representative to play Washington in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1, 2001.\n\nSurvey Purdue's roster during that time period and you'll get various answers on the program-shifting moment that resulted in that Rose Bowl trip. For some, it's that game at USC. Others say Purdue's upset of No. 4 Kansas State in the 1998 Alamo Bowl.\n\nTiller's second game as Boilermaker coach on Sept. 13, 1997. The roster was a blend of Jim Colletto recruits, who'd been a part of a 3-8 team the season before, and the Big Ten's lowest-rated recruiting class.\n\n\"I was in coach Tiller’s first class. So prior to us getting there, they were nothing,\" safety Tim Upshur said. \"And I'll never forget our first game we played my freshman year was Toledo.\n\nPart 1: How coach Joe Tiller laid foundation for Purdue football's 2000 Rose Bowl team\n\nPart 2: Joe Tiller's coaching staff was 'equally as good' as Purdue football Rose Bowl team\n\nTo outsiders, it was same old Purdue. Tiller's postgame message was a sign these Boilermakers were anything but.\n\n\"We've got some work to do,\" he told the team.\n\nTiller also said the team Purdue would beat Notre Dame the following game. Whether he believed it or not is irrelevant. The players believed that Tiller believed. And then they believed.\n\nPurdue beat Notre Dame for the first time since 1985 in Tiller's second game as head coach on Sept. 13, 1997, seven days after losing his first to Toledo.\n\n\"It goes back to that cultural shift,\" offensive lineman Chukky Okobi said. \"You go back to '96 and we can’t beat anybody and all the sudden we beat Notre Dame in '97. What else can we do? That kind of became the mindset going forward. If we can beat this team, there’s no reason we can’t beat every team.\"\n\nWest Lafayette was abuzz over its football program for the first time in years.\n\n\"The first game I ever dressed for was '97 against Notre Dame and that was the infamous (game). We win and they throw the goal post in the Wabash (River),\" punter Scott Kurz said. \"We enjoyed the energy our fans brought. It caught a lot of teams off guard and it was a real special memory for all of us.\"\n\nNotre Dame was the first of six consecutive wins in what became a 9-3 season, capped by beating Oklahoma State in the Alamo Bowl.\n\nBetween 1997-99, Purdue, which hadn't posted a winning record since 1984 previously, went a combined 25-12.\n\n\"That's where the great deal of pride I have in this institution today is because I felt like I was a part of turning the tide and changing the narrative of what Purdue football is, what it was and would it could be,\" said former cornerback Lamar Conard, who was Purdue's running backs coach until a few weeks ago, and whose last season playing was 1999.\n\nAll that did was up the ante for that 2000 season, when Tiller's first Purdue recruits would be seniors.\n\n\"I remember our recruiting class coming in 1997, we were the last-place ranked recruiting class (in the Big Ten) coming in,\" quarterback Drew Brees said in an interview with Journal & Courier in 2015. \"But we made a commitment to one another that by the time we left Purdue, we were going to be Big Ten champs and we were going to the Rose Bowl. That’s exactly what we had the chance to do.\"\n\nNathan Baird and Sam King have the best Purdue sports coverage, and \n\nThis article originally appeared on Indianapolis Star: Purdue football trip to Rose Bowl helped them envision Rose Bowl berth",

    "fullText": "Several weeks ago, USA Track and Field sent out a survey to several athletes asking whether they'd like to be considered for All-American honors.\n\nThe email popped into Violet Hall's inbox. The Bloomington South senior figured she was one of hundreds, maybe thousands, to get the query, especially after finding out a couple of friends she'd made while competing in Para track meets over the summer received them as well.\n\nBasically spam, she thought. But, she filled it out, sent it back and forgot all about it.\n\nA couple of days ago, the USATF responded. Hall's friend sent his Para High School All-American certificate, which listed his events. Hall got one too, but hers was different.\n\n\"It said, 'Female Athlete of the Year,\" Hall said. \"I said, 'Wait, why is mine different?' I sent it to him, and he said, \"Read it. It literally says I won Track Athlete of the Year.' I didn't know. I was confused and then it hit me.\n\n\"I sent a screen shot to my parents. Pretty cool.\"\n\nI am truly grateful and honored to be selected for the USATF Para High School All-American Team and to receive the Female Track Athlete of the Year award. Thank you for this incredible recognition and support!@usatf @USParaTF @JimGordillo @BHSS_Athletics pic.twitter.com/stFEPC3MBL\n\n— Violet Hall (@violethall2026) December 15, 2025\n\nPretty cool indeed for Hall, who was one of two high schoolers invited to represent Team USA in track at the Para World Games in New Delhi, India in September.\n\nShe qualified in the 100 and 200 dashes in the T47 category. She was fifth in the 200, lowering her PR to 25.50 in the semifinals, and was eighth in the 100 in 12.62.\n\nThe trip was a memorable one, though she and her father, who accompanied her, saw more of the inside of her hotel than any tourist traps. Hall spent much of her downtime between her four races, catching up on homework and applying to college.\n\n\"Stuff I would have been doing at home,\" said Hall, who also hit up the hotel pool a few times, the average high that time of year in the mid-90s and lows in the 70s.\n\nTeam USA did set up a few trips as a group, but mostly it was a business trip, taking care to eat food prepared for the team to make sure no one got sick.\n\nFor her, the experience was everything as a first-time Para World Champ participant. She tried not to put any pressure on herself as a first-timer, just happy to be there and trying to do her best. If she got a medal, great. If not, it was huge just to be there.\n\n\"For me, it was more just an experience-building thing,\" Hall said. \"Running against people who have competed in Para circuits and worlds and Paralympics multiple times for 5-10 years.\n\n\"So being young an able to get to that point, I have so much more to prove, so much more to do for myself. I hope I can make a big difference and continue to grow.\"\n\nShe has certainly increased her circle of friends in the sport.\n\n\"Probably just meeting everyone and competing at that level,\" Hall said of the best thing about her trip. \"Going into it, I had been watching those people race and I was on the line with them. It all happened so fast.\"\n\nHall's first Para races took place early in the summer after the IHSAA state track meet ended. Three months later, she was in a massive stadium in India representing her country in a pro-like atmosphere.\n\n\"The call room air felt a lot heavier,\" Hall said. \"Not just because of the pressure, but it was also hot. They had fans going and I was sitting right next to one.\n\n\"Everyone was in their own bubble. Almost no one was talking. All you could hear was the fans.\"\n\nMore: South's Jasmine Martoglio leads All-Area Girls Cross Country Team\n\nMore: North's Jacob Mitchell leads IHSAA All-Area Boys Cross Country team\n\nAnd after the developments of the past few months, she might be playing for a different set of fans at the college level than what she had envisioned a year ago. Basketball was her main sport and it's still important as South has it's sights set high this season. But track seems more likely in the future.\n\n\"It's definitely been a big change, a big shift, from basketball,\" Hall said. \"Going into my junior year, I wouldn't have expected everything to have happened to happen.\n\n\"I'm just extremely grateful for the opportunities I've been provided, and grateful God led me through it. I'm just very happy to get to where I am today and excited to continue.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Herald-Times: South para-athlete Violet Hall earns top award from USATF",

    "fullText": "In a recent interview with DJMario (h/t SPORT), former Real Madrid defender and club legend Marcelo has named the one Barcelona player he would bring to the Santiago Bernabeu.\n\nThe former left-back, who announced his retirement from football earlier this year, named Pedri as his pick ahead of 2025 Ballon d’Or runner-up Lamine Yamal, claiming that the Barcelona midfield maestro had that bit of ‘Madrid quality’ in him.\n\n“Right now, I would sign Pedri for Madrid. He has that Madrid quality. Everyone would say Lamine, but I think Pedri would be a better signing,” said Marcelo.\n\nPedri has been a key player for Barcelona in recent seasons and was one of the chief driving forces behind their successful 2024/25 campaign under Hansi Flick.\n\nInterestingly, the 23-year-old Spanish international could have been a Real Madrid player, with the club having offered him a trial in the past, only to turn him down.\n\nMarcelo would sign Pedri for Real Madrid. (Photo by Angel Martinez/Getty Images)\n\n“When I took the test at Valdebebas it was strange; they told me I wasn’t up to standard and I went home,“ Pedri revealed during an interview about his trial at Real Madrid.\n\nSpeaking about his career in football, Marcelo recalled some of the toughest opponents he faced and took a clear stance in favour of Cristiano Ronaldo in the debate against Lionel Messi.\n\n“Messi was very tough. Jesus Navas also made it very difficult for me, and I found Xabi Prieto very difficult to defend against too. Pedrito was also very good,” said Marcelo.\n\n“I’ll always go with Cristiano. Messi is incredible. We’ve enjoyed both of them, well, I’ve only enjoyed one. I’m a die-hard Cristiano fan,” he noted.\n\nEven though it has been a few years since he left the club, the Marcelo family legacy will continue through his son Enzo, who plays in the Real Madrid youth ranks and is an international with Spain.\n\n“Enzo is doing well. He feels the pressure of being my son, but as he has grown up in the Madrid dressing room, he is now realising who the players are. They have seen him grow up, they have taken him under their wing,” said Marcelo.\n\n“Now he realises that what he has experienced is not normal. He is happy and content. I love that he is playing for Spain. The national team has been very good to us. They are very fond of my son. He made the decision and he’s very happy,” he concluded.",

Where we playing, who we playing, put the ball down and go play. That's the attitude this team has had since Day One, it's the attitude we'll have until the last game we play this year. Respect everybody, fear nobody, go play,\" Stafford said.\n\nThe No. 1 seed in the playoffs is a big advantage primarily because of the first-round bye that comes with it, and secondarily because of home-field advantage.

My focus is just on this club and I am proud to be here. One week ago in Italy it was the same with Juventus.\n\n\"I don't pay attention to it.

    "description": "FC Bayern is in debt to Karl-Heinz Rummenigge…",
    "fullText": "There is a long and deep history between Uli Hoeneß and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge at Bayern Munich. Recently, Hoeneß took some time to talk through just how much Rummenigge has meant to the club, including how he helped reshape the club’s future by leaving for Inter Milan.\n\n“I experienced pretty much everything you can experience with him. He came to FC Bayern as a young player in 1974, shortly after we had won the World Cup. We welcomed him back then. He was an incredible dribbler, but a bit nervous at first, so the goals didn’t come right away. But he matured into an absolute world-class player at FC Bayern and in the national team. He later continued his career at Inter Milan and in Geneva,” Hoeneß told Sport1’s Stefan Kumberger (as captured by @iMiaSanMia). “When I became manager, FC Bayern had debts of around seven million marks. Through his transfer – that was about eleven million marks at the time – then we became debt-free. With the remaining four million, I then signed Lothar Matthäus for two million and Roland Wohlfarth for one million. The remaining million was used to create FC Bayern’s fixed deposit account. We must be infinitely grateful to Karl-Heinz for that. His transfer helped FC Bayern get healthy.”\n\nThese days, it is hard to imagine a Bayern Munich without either man. Though they have pledged to remain on the supervisory board until the club is “ready”, the day will arrive where both are fully out of the mix.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…",

    "description": "Proposed development at Parnham House is being opposed by conservationists who say a rescued albino is living in a meadow on the estate",
    "fullText": "Plans for the £25 million restoration of a 16th-century stately home could be scuppered by claims that an albino badger named Alberto is living nearby.\n\nThe badger is said to be living in a meadow alongside the River Brit in Dorset, having been rescued by wildlife volunteers in 2015 because he was being attacked by other badgers due to his unusual colour. He has since been joined by a family of albino badgers.\n\nConservationists fear that the “quiet, undisturbed” Millground meadow the badgers call home will be bulldozed to make way for a housing development to fund the restoration of Parnham House.\n\nThe grade I listed Elizabethan manor house was destroyed in a fire believed to have been deliberately started by its former owner Michael Treichl in 2017.\n\nJames Perkins, an entrepreneur, bought the house in 2020, vowing to restore it to its former glory.\n\nHe intends to build 82 homes and two visitor accommodation lodges on the sprawling country estate, near Beaminster, to fund the £25 million restoration of the south wing as “a private home with a hospitality offering”.\n\nThe Dorset Natural Heritage Initiative, which is campaigning against the development, said: “Millground meadow isn’t just a green space, it’s home to one of the UK’s rarest sights: a regular population of albino badgers.\n\n“Beaminster first grew attached to Alberto, an injured albino badger which was rescued back in 2015, but he’s no longer alone.\n\n“These pale, pink-eyed badgers now rely on the meadow’s quiet, undisturbed habitat to survive — occasionally visiting the houses dotted along this stretch of the River Brit.\n\n“Badgers and other wildlife were the winners in the Covid lockdowns, taking advantage of the resultant peace and quiet to explore and thrive in their reclaimed territories. It now looks like that peace could be shattered for ever.\n\n“The proposed Parnham housing development will bulldoze the meadow area to erect a dozen £1.25 million townhouses along with a £2 million road bridge across the river — threatening to destroy this fragile environment.”\n\nColin Varndell, a local resident, said the meadow was a haven for lots of wildlife, including barn owls, otters, grass snakes and dormice.\n\nHe said: “I am not interested in saving the house — that can fall down as far as I am concerned — but it would be catastrophic for nature.”\n\nPlanning documents state that the housing development would be inspired by Poundbury, the King’s model town built on Duchy of Cornwall land near Dorchester.\n\nThe planning agents said the development “has been very carefully sited to sit sympathetically within the estate to ensure that it does not have an undue impact on the setting of Parnham House, nor on views into the site from the surrounding landscape”.\n\nEd Grant, senior project manager of the Parnham Park estate, said: “There is zero evidence of any badgers within 30 metres of the proposals, as documented in the application and surveyed by specialist consultants.\n\n“The evidence of a single albino badger in Beaminster was in 2015 and not on our estate. I am sure you have seen the articles from then and sadly that badger died.\n\n“We have consistently endeavoured to try to speak with the group who are spreading misinformation, to have a constructive conversation about the proposals, but they have refused.”",

    "description": "The Roman soldiers posted to hold off invaders were riddled with intestinal parasites, analysis of latrine drains at Vindolanda in Northumberland shows",
    "fullText": "WH Auden’s poem about a miserable Roman soldier guarding a rain-soaked frontier in northern Europe mentions “lice in my tunic and a cold in my nose”. It seems the poet could have added serious stomach trouble to that catalogue of woes.\n\nAnalysis of sewer drains from the Roman fort of Vindolanda, close to Hadrian’s Wall, has shown that the occupants were riddled by three types of intestinal parasite: roundworm, whipworm and Giardia duodenalis. All are spread through the contamination of food, drink or hands by human faeces.\n\nThe findings may add a new dimension to impressions of life defending the northern edge of Rome’s dominions. “The three types of parasites we found could have led to malnutrition [and] diarrhoea in some of the Roman soldiers,” said Dr Marissa Ledger, who helped lead the study as part of her PhD with the University of Cambridge’s archaeology department.\n\n• Nine ways to avoid getting ill before Christmas\n\nThe findings are the first evidence for Giardia duodenalis in Roman Britain. The microscopic protozoan parasites cause outbreaks of diarrhoea. Whipworms grow to about 5cm long and roundworms can reach 30cm.\n\n“While the Romans were aware of intestinal worms, there was little their doctors could do to clear infection by these parasites or help those experiencing diarrhoea, meaning symptoms could persist and worsen,” Ledger said. “These chronic infections likely weakened soldiers, reducing their fitness for duty.”\n\nVindolanda, which is located between Carlisle and Corbridge in Northumberland, was constructed by the Romans in the early 2nd century AD to defend their province of Britannia from attack by northern tribes.\n\nIt remained in use until the end of the 4th century and was defended by infantry, archery and cavalry units drawn from across the empire. The site has become known for preserving objects in its waterlogged soil — including more than 5,000 Roman leather shoes.\n\n• Truth of vast network of Roman roads revealed\n\nThe latest analysis by Cambridge and Oxford researchers, published in the journal Parasitology, looked at sediment from a sewer drain leading from a latrine block.\n\nFifty samples were taken along the 9m-long drain, which carried waste from a communal latrine to a stream. Researchers used microscopes to hunt for remains of the eggs of parasitic worms that infect humans and other animals.\n\nMore than a quarter of the samples contained roundworm or whipworm eggs, and one held remnants of both worm species. When researchers turned to a technique that used antibodies to bind onto the proteins produced by single-celled organisms, they then found traces of Giardia duodenalis.\n\nThe team also took a sample connected to an earlier fort, constructed around 85AD and abandoned about seven years later. The sample came from a ditch that formed part of the fort’s defensive system; it contained both roundworm and whipworm.\n\nDr Piers Mitchell of Cambridge, senior author of the study, said: “Some soldiers could have become severely ill from dehydration during summer outbreaks of Giardia, which are often linked to contaminated water and can infect dozens of people at a time. Untreated giardiasis can drag on for weeks, causing dramatic fatigue and weight loss.\n\n“The presence of the faecal-oral parasites we found suggests conditions were ripe for other intestinal pathogens such as salmonella and shigella, which could have triggered additional disease outbreaks.”\n\nThe Vindolanda findings mirror those at Roman military sites elsewhere including Carnuntum, in Austria; Valkenburg on Rhine in the Netherlands; and Bearsden in Scotland. Samples taken at urban sites such as London and York show a more diverse parasite range, including fish and meat tapeworms.\n\n• Seven of the most fascinating Roman ruins in the UK\n\nDr Patrik Flammer, who analysed samples at the University of Oxford, said: “Despite the fact that Vindolanda had communal latrines and a sewer system, this still did not protect the soldiers from infecting each other.”\n\nDr Andrew Birley, who leads excavations at Vindolanda, said they “continue to find new evidence that helps us to understand the incredible hardships faced by those posted to this northwestern frontier of the Roman Empire nearly 2,000 years ago”.",

    "description": "Cryptocurrency Exchange Architecture is the framework of a crypto platform, ensuring efficient trade matching, secure wallets, liquidity handling, and smooth user interaction for reliable trading",
    "fullText": "Cryptocurrency exchange architecture forms the foundation of every trading platform, determining how trades are executed, funds are secured, and users interact. In 2026, with over 200 active exchanges globally and centralized platforms like Binance handling nearly 40% of the world’s spot trading volume, having a secure, scalable, and high-performance architecture is more important than ever.\n\nAs the crypto ecosystem evolves, exchange platforms are adopting new technologies, from hybrid and decentralized models to advanced security protocols and automated liquidity management. These innovations ensure faster transactions, enhanced user experience, and regulatory compliance, positioning modern exchanges to meet the demands of both retail and institutional traders.\n\nIn this blog, we’ll explore the latest trends, core components, and architectural advancements shaping cryptocurrency exchanges today.\n\nCryptocurrency exchange architecture is the technical blueprint of an exchange, defining how the trading engine matches orders, how funds are stored, and how users interact. Leveraging scalable engines, real-time order books, and intuitive frontends, a well-designed architecture ensures fast, secure, and compliant operations, supporting both high-volume traders and everyday users in a reliable, seamless environment.\n\nWhen built well, this architecture makes the exchange fast, secure, and dependable. Conversely, poorly designed architecture can lead to downtime, security vulnerabilities, or slow, frustrating user experiences, issues that can quickly harm an exchange’s reputation in today’s competitive market.\n\nTo understand how exchanges are built, here are the primary building blocks:\n\nAny exchange revolves around the trading or matching engine. It pairs buy and sell orders according to the rules such as price-time priority. The engine also needs to be able to process millions of orders in a second with a small latency in the high-performance systems. As an example, the matching engine of Binance can handle very large throughput\n\nLiquidity is the capacity to sell or purchase assets very easily without any major alterations in prices. Trades employ various liquidity designs: centralized order books with designated market makers, on-chain liquidity books (in the case of DEXs), or hybrid. The architecture should facilitate effective access to liquidity, potentially with a combination of several sources.\n\nThe manner in which an exchange manages user money is of the essence. Other exchanges are custodial (they custody user wallets), non-custodial (the user retains control with private keys). Hybrid models may allow both. The wallet architecture also determines the nature of handling deposits, withdrawals, and cold/ hot storage in a secure way.\n\nOrder book records outstanding buys/sell orders. Exchanges can be on-chain (occasionally deployed on pure DEX), off-chain or in-memory. The structure of the order book has an impact on performance, transparency and security.\n\nIt has no compromise on security: It includes authentication (KYC, 2FA), fund security (Multi-sig, cold storage), smart contract audits (DEX), and resistance to trading risks, such as front-running, MEV, or DDoS. These security layers should be in-built in the architecture.\n\nTrade is made easy, responsive and trustworthy with the good front end. The UX should receive order placement, charting, account and wallet connections, and give real-time feedback.\n\nA robust admin panel allows operators to monitor trades, manage liquidity, configure markets, and handle risk. Modern exchanges also include crypto exchange APIs for automated tools, third-party integrations, and liquidity management, essential for scalability in turnkey deployments.\n\nIn particular, the fiat on-ramps and off-ramps (banks, payment processors) come in handy, especially when it comes to centralized exchanges. The architecture should be equipped with trustworthy and secure payment systems to exchange crypto and fiat.\n\nThere are various types of cryptocurrency exchange that have their own architecture, features, advantages, and trade-offs. Knowing such types assists the user, the developer and investors to assess performance, security and usability.\n\nCentralized exchanges operate on a traditional client-server model, where the platform manages user accounts, wallets, and order matching. Trades are executed through a central server, which allows for high-speed transactions, deep liquidity, and fiat integration. Such are Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. As convenient and quick to trade, CEXs force the user to leave their money in the hands of the platform to be hacked.\n\nDEXs run on blockchain networks and smart contracts, enabling peer-to-peer trading without a central authority. Users keep control over their money decreasing counterparty risk. Liquidity is dealt with by order books or automated market makers (AMMs). These are Uniswap and dYdX. DEXs are more transparent, secure, and decentralized, although they can be slower in their transactions and have more expensive network charges than CEXs.\n\nHybrid exchanges are built on the combination of CEXs and DEXs features to provide both speed and liquidity with the added non-custodial security. Ordinarily, the way an order matching is conducted is off-chain and then settled on-chain. This is the most optimal solution because it offers the speed of trading, lower charges and enables users to have greater control over funds. The hybrid models are becoming popular to bridge between centralized convenience and decentralized trust.\n\nP2P exchanges connect buyers and sellers directly, allowing them to trade crypto using local currencies or payment methods. The platform usually serves as an escrow service to brush off transactions and fraud. They are Paxful and LocalBitcoins. P2P exchanges offer more options in payment, privacy, and accessibility particularly where banking infrastructure is least developed but might lack liquidity compared to the CEXs.\n\nThe exchange is driven by the backend which deals with trades, liquidity and wallet security, and the front end is to be used to provide the user with a clean, user-friendly interface. The two provide a combination of fast, reliable and safe trading.\n\nCryptocurrency exchange architecture shapes how modern trading platforms operate, from order matching and liquidity flow to wallets, user dashboards, and backend systems. As centralized, decentralized, hybrid, and P2P models grow, the right architectural approach helps ensure smooth trades, consistent performance, and a better trading experience for users.\n\nWith emerging trends like AI-driven trading, Layer 2 networks, cross-chain functionality, and enhanced UX/UI, exchanges are evolving to meet the expectations of both retail and institutional traders. When platforms prioritize strong design, dependable performance, and regulatory alignment, they establish trust and remain competitive in a rapidly evolving market.\n\nIn this landscape, cryptocurrency exchange development is about building a foundation that can adapt to new technologies and industry demands. A well-structured architecture doesn’t just run a platform , it supports long-term growth and shapes the future of your exchange .just run a platform , it supports long-term growth and shapes the future of your exchange.",

    "fullText": "Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing for his annual televised Q&A session, and a new poll shows Russians remain focused on two issues: the war and the economy.\n\nAccording to a poll of 1,608 Russians conducted by the independent Levada Center, the top two concerns Russians want to raise with Putin are when the war will end and how they're supposed to cope with a deteriorating economy.\n\nAbout a fifth of respondents said they would ask Putin when the war in Ukraine, which the Kremlin calls a \"special military operation,\" would end.\n\nRight behind the war is the economy, as another 16% say their top question is about living standards — salaries, pensions, and benefits.\n\nThese two concerns have topped Levada's polls ahead of Putin's annual Q&A for three years.\n\nBeyond the top concerns, Levada found that 8% of respondents want to ask Putin about price growth and tax hikes, 6% about utilities and social services, and 5% about the healthcare system.\n\nThe anxiety comes as Russia's inflation remains high, and the country's massive defense spending jostles with social spending.\n\nPutin's televised \"Direct Line\" Q&A session, scheduled for Friday, comes nearly four years after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, triggering sweeping Western sanctions.\n\nSince the invasion in February 2022, the Kremlin has steered the country onto a wartime economic footing.\n\nHeavy defense spending and state-directed investment have helped sustain headline economic growth, even as sanctions and export restrictions have reshaped trade flows.\n\nBut strains are showing: Energy export revenues have dropped in a softer oil-price environment, while high inflation continues to sap consumer demand.\n\nPrevious hourslong \"Direct Line\" broadcasts offer a preview of how Putin may handle the questions the Kremlin allows.\n\nLast year, Putin acknowledged that Russia's economy was overheating amid high inflation and warned citizens to brace for continued pressure.\n\nHowever, he deflected blame, suggesting that both the central bank and the Russian federal government — formally headed by the prime minister — could have acted more decisively to prevent the surge in prices and credit growth.\n\nPutin is also expected to hold an end-of-year news conference on Friday, where the spotlight will be on any signals he offers about the direction of the war.",

    "title": "New H-1B visa rules upgrade some lottery applicants — and squeeze out others",
    "description": "New H-1B visa rules favor Big Tech's big salaries, limiting opportunities for startups and entry-level applicants in the job market.",
    "fullText": "The H-1B visa has always created winners and losers. Every spring, the government runs a lottery for 110,000 new visas. Last fiscal year, nearly half a million people put their names in.\n\nThis fall, the Trump administration set new rules in motion that immigration lawyers say will upgrade some foreign nationals in the lottery, while others will get squeezed out.\n\nTrump's overhaul of the H-1B visa program slaps a $100,000 fee on new petitions for workers living abroad, and includes a proposal that would tilt the lottery in favor of the highest-paid applicants. Instead of giving every applicant a single, equal shot, the lottery would give workers in the top wage bracket four chances. Those in the lowest tier would continue to get just one.\n\nSuddenly, a machine-learning researcher promised a pro-athlete-sized paycheck looks like a slam dunk in the lottery compared to a junior developer at a midsize company.\n\nThe written comment period on the wage rule ended in late October, and the Department of Homeland Security is now reviewing comments and preparing the text of the final rule.\n\nThe Trump administration holds that employers have abused the H-1B as a way to hire IT talent cheaply. A September executive order announcing the new fee framed the issue as a raw deal for American workers, saying the program had been \"deliberately exploited\" to replace them with lower-paid foreign labor. The fee is now facing multiple legal challenges in federal courts.\n\nIn a statement, Matthew J. Tragesser, a spokesman for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, told Business Insider that the agency is working closely with the Department of Labor and the State Department to reform the H-1B program to \"root out fraud.\"\n\n\"The proposed rule will protect American workers, encourage employers to offer competitive wages, and ensure that H-1B visas go to top-tier talent filling critical, high-skill positions as the law intended,\" Tragesser said.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Department is tightening its screening of H-1B workers and their H-4 family members. The department directed consular officers to review applicants' social media and other public online activity as a standard part of the process — a shift that has led some consulates to cancel or reschedule visa appointments as they adjust to the new vetting rules.\n\nA State Department spokesperson framed the expanded screening as part of a broader push toward rigorous vetting over fast processing. The department said it may move appointments as resources change, with applicants able to request expedited slots on a case-by-case basis.\n\nImmigration lawyers say the proposed lottery updates hand an edge to large tech companies.\n\nThe fee won't apply to most hires in Big Tech's pipeline, said Jason Finkelman, an Austin, Texas, attorney focused on employment and family immigration. It's much more common for those companies to poach visa holders already in the United States, or hire new grads straight out of American schools, whereas the fee only affects new petitions for workers living abroad.\n\nA National Foundation for American Policy analysis of government data found that in fiscal year 2025, Amazon led all employers with 4,644 approved new H-1B petitions, followed by Meta, Microsoft, and Google. It was the first time these four tech giants occupied the top four spots.\n\nLarge enterprises will treat the $100,000 H-1B fee as the price of getting the right people inside their organizations, said Edward Raleigh, a partner at Fragomen, one of the largest global immigration law firms.\n\nJustin Parsons, a partner at law firm BAL, which focuses on work immigration, is telling his tech clients that the fee could actually work in their favor. They can absorb a fee that startups and IT staffing firms cannot. In a lottery, when high-volume filers pull back, everyone else's odds improve, including those of cash-rich tech companies still submitting names. Plus, if the wage rule goes into effect, it would give Big Tech's big-ticket hires a better chance of success.\n\nThe wage-based system would shift the odds even further toward large, often publicly traded companies that can afford to slot foreign hires into the top salary bands. Immigration lawyers say that would leave equity-heavy but cash-poor startups at a disadvantage in the lottery.\n\n\"Often the best startup founders forgo being paid a living wage because they're so dedicated to the mission,\" said Bay Area immigration lawyer Sophie Alcorn. Those same startups \"may be the ones that have the most difficulty in getting the right people through this future system.\"\n\nOne exception, said Alcorn, is the crop of well-funded artificial intelligence startups, where base pay for elite machine-learning researchers and engineers is already sky-high.\n\nUnder the new system, international students would also have fewer shots on goal.\n\nNew grads typically start in lower-wage tiers, which would give them fewer tickets in the lottery, just as small and midsize companies are backing away from sponsoring them at all.\n\nAlcorn, who serves mostly entrepreneurs and early-stage tech companies, said a handful of jobseekers, including international students, have told her that companies have pulled offers to those requiring visa sponsorship — spooked by headlines and shifting rules.\n\nOn paper, most foreign students who are already in the United States shouldn't be hit with the $100,000 fee, Finkelman said. If they're on F-1 student visas and move onto H-1Bs, that's a change of status, not a brand-new petition, so the fee wouldn't apply, he said.\n\nThe Trump administration has framed these updates as a win for American workers. Software engineers, in particular, have something to gain if the changes achieve their stated intent.\n\nThe tech industry has shed tens of thousands of staff this year, with Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta all cutting engineering-heavy roles as they restructure around automation. At the same time, early-stage startups are boasting that machines now do a huge share of the coding.\n\nImmigration lawyers are suggesting that some companies will pull back from hiring foreign talent under these new rules. The Trump administration is banking on some of those jobs now defaulting to American-born workers and green-card holders by the process of least resistance.\n\nDomestic coders are contending with both layoffs and LLMs. But in this new hierarchy of risk, the American engineer could become a safer, cheaper bet than a foreign hire whose visa now comes with more cost, paperwork, and regulatory headaches.\n\n\"One of the main attributes of this administration is that it keeps people guessing,\" said Ted Chiappari, head of the immigration group at law firm Duane Morris. \"Just because things are one way on Monday doesn't mean they're going to be the same way on Tuesday, and they won't switch back on Wednesday.\"",

Those methods left a lasting impression on those who played for him and would themselves go on to become managers.\n\nOne of those was Wayne Rooney, with the former England and Manchester United captain revealing on his latest podcast episode how he was influenced by Allardyce in the latter stages of his playing career before taking his first steps in coaching.\n\n\"At the time I was under Sam [at Everton between 2017 and 2018] I was older and I knew I wanted to go into coaching,\" Rooney said on The Wayne Rooney Show.\n\n\"So I was more observing [Allardyce] as well and obviously as a manager you're looking at everything. But I was more observing and taking in what he was doing and how he was working.\"",

    "fullText": "Dan Ballard says Granit Xhaka's arrival raised the standards at Sunderland to help them compete in the top half of the Premier League.\n\nSwitzerland midfielder Xhaka was one of several summer signings following the club's promotion from the Championship through the play-offs.\n\nThe 33-year-old, who joined from Bayer Leverkusen, was installed as captain, and his leadership has had a clear impact on a side that has settled right back into life in the top flight.\n\nSunderland are currently eighth in the table - just two points off the top four - following their 1-0 derby win against Newcastle on Sunday.\n\nBallard, who was in Arsenal's academy when Xhaka was at the Gunners, told Football Focus: \"He's an amazing guy.\n\n\"I was a bit surprised when we signed him. I wasn't sure what it'd be like. I didn't think one person could affect the team the way he's done.\n\n\"From minute one, I think the standards really rose because he does everything to 100%.\n\n\"It's kind of like, well if he's got that amazing career and he's still doing everything perfectly, why wouldn't we? And I think it just sort of lifted the standards.\"\n\nSunderland have won seven and lost just four of their 16 league games, and Ballard attributed Xhaka's influence to that winning mentality.\n\n\"I mean literally everything, from the work in the gym to the standards, he puts out on the training pitch,\" added the centre-back, 26.\n\n\"You know we've just been outside, it can be cold and wet and but he's 100% focused and giving everything in training.\n\n\"So when some of us boys may be not putting that work in and you see him doing it, it's unacceptable for us.\n\n\"If he's doing it, he's won titles and played hundreds of games in the Premier League. Then why shouldn't we? It's lifted everyone.\"",

    "description": "England are pushed towards the precipice of the fastest Ashes series defeat in more than 100 years as a Travis Head century maintains Australia's grip on the third Test in Adelaide.",
    "fullText": "Third Ashes Test, Adelaide Oval (day three of five)\n\nAustralia 371: Carey 106, Archer 5-53 & 271-4: Head 142*, Carey 52*\n\nEngland 286: Stokes 83, Archer 51; Boland 3-45\n\nEngland were pushed towards the precipice of the fastest Ashes series defeat in more than 100 years as a Travis Head century maintained Australia's grip on the third Test in Adelaide.\n\nHead was dropped on 99 by Harry Brook and spent eight balls one run short of a hundred before belting Joe Root down the ground for four to draw a deafening roar from his home-town crowd at the Adelaide Oval.\n\nThe left-hander moved Australia's second innings to 271-4 and their overall lead to 356 at the end of the third day.\n\nIf England's third loss in as many Tests is completed on Saturday, it would mean the Ashes have been decided in 10 days of cricket.\n\nNot since 1921, when Australia needed only eight days of play to win in England, has the destination of the urn been settled so swiftly.\n\nHead's inevitable ton snuffed out brief England hope that was raised when captain Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer added 73 runs in the morning session.\n\nStokes made 83 and Archer 51 in a stand of 106, the highest by an England ninth-wicket pair in Australia since 1924.\n\nAt 53-2 and 149-4, England clung on before being cut adrift by Head. At some point, England will be tasked with pulling off the highest successful chase on this ground in order to keep the Ashes alive.\n\nOf further concern to the visitors is the fitness of all-rounder Stokes, who is yet to bowl in the 66 overs of Australia's second innings.\n\nRealistically, England's fate in this match and the series was sealed by their batting on the second day.\n\nIt needed a trademark Stokes miracle to keep his team from their destiny and, despite how well the captain and Archer have personally performed in this match, Stokes might have exhausted his escape acts.\n\nThere will be questions over all-rounder Stokes' physical state for the rest of the series. Never one to avoid work when his team need him, there were times when he was bent double in the field.\n\nBar the 90 minutes of resistance England mustered in the morning session, this day went as expected – Australia batting under minimal pressure, grinding England into the dirt.\n\nEngland's effort cannot be faulted, they are simply being outclassed. They are suffering a slow death in the City of Churches, a prolonged post-mortem of the Bazball project.\n\nA team aim will be to extend the match to Sunday, to at least avoid a historically swift series defeat. Individuals like Zak Crawley, Ollie Pope and Jamie Smith need runs to alleviate growing pressure on their international futures.\n\nHead's elevation to open the batting on the second day of the first Test will go down as one of the defining moments of the series. His match-winning century in Perth gave Australia a momentum they have never looked like relinquishing.\n\nThis ton was memorable for different reasons. Like Alex Carey on day one, Head is another South Australian enjoying an Ashes moment on home turf. This was his fourth successive century in Tests at the Adelaide Oval.\n\nHe had to endure a lively England burst with the new ball, particularly from Brydon Carse. With the storm weathered, Stokes absent from the attack and Will Jacks unable to hold an end, Head cashed in.\n\nEngland tried different plans, at one point packing the off side with seven fielders, but Head still found ways to score. He added 84 for the fourth wicket with Usman Khawaja, who made 40 to further his case to be retained for the fourth Test.\n\nThe chance to Brook, off the bowling off Archer, was a powerful slash to gully. It would have been a smart catch, though should have been taken. In the next over, Head lofted Root's off-spin down the ground to complete his 11th Test ton.\n\nIt was fitting that Carey was Head's partner when he reached three figures. Their partnership stood at 122 by the close, with Carey unbeaten on 52 and eyeing a second hundred in the match.\n\nStokes and Archer are among the few England players to have performed so far on this tour. Their tight relationship goes back to the 2019 World Cup final.\n\nWhen Stokes was captured on camera on the second morning giving Archer a tongue-lashing for his bowling, it was an example of how Stokes knows he can get the best from his paceman.\n\nFrom 213-8 overnight, and with 12 overs in the morning before the second new ball, the ninth-wicket pair were more expansive than the previous evening.\n\nStokes drove Scott Boland for four from the third ball of the day, Archer swiped Nathan Lyon over long-on for six.\n\nStokes' 50, from 159 balls, was his slowest in Test cricket and the slowest by any England batter in the Bazball era. Archer, who took five wickets in Australia's first innings, made his maiden half-century in Tests and the second-highest score by an England number 10 in Australia.\n\nStokes deserved a hundred only for Mitchell Starc to hit the stumps through the gate. Stokes roared in frustration, while Archer chased the captain all the way to the boundary to pat him on the back.\n\nCaptain Stokes 'knackered' but 'fit to bowl'\n\nHead grinds England down on third day - as it happened\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

Interest in the contest was such that visitors almost crashed the online system offering score updates.\n\nThat came amid an unbeaten run of 86 matches in the Women's Series, which has provided five competitors in an expanded 128-player world championship.\n\nLittler admitted he hoped to avoid the woman nicknamed 'Beau and Arrow' when the draw was made.\n\n\"Beau Greaves is definitely one that I wouldn't want to play,\" said Littler, who in January became the youngest world darts champion aged 17, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"She's world class, that's why she's won the Women's World Championship three times.\n\n\"She's been dominating the Women's Series for two or three years now and she's only going to get better and better.\"\n\nFive-time world champion Raymond van Barneveld has predicted a good run in the Worlds could see Greaves invited to the eight-player Premier League - although 2021 world champion Gerwyn Price described that suggestion as \"a joke\".\n\nOnly one woman has won matches on the world stage at the Ally Pally - Fallon Sherrock twice in December 2019 - while Greaves' debut three years ago ended in a first-round defeat by William O'Connor.",

    "description": "\"Our officers are dedicated.\"",
    "fullText": "A major international criminal vape shipment recently went up in smoke, due to the efforts of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials located near Chicago O'Hare International Airport.\n\nThe agency announced the bust in a press release and revealed the confiscated goods were worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. An inspection of a delivery from China en route to Mississippi uncovered 43,200 unlisted components of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS).\n\nMembers of the CBP and FDA at Chicago's Central Examination Station assessed that the goods both lacked proper FDA marketing permissions and were improperly valued. The criminals involved were trying to sneak in contraband and avoid paying taxes on it.\n\nOfficials identified the ENDS pieces as Kangvape Onee Sticks and valued the shipment at a whopping $358,000. That, of course, will not be cashed in by the parties in Mississippi, as the merchandise instead heads to the CBP's Fines, Penalties, and Forfeiture office.\n\n\"Our officers are dedicated to identifying and intercepting these types of shipments which could potentially harm the health and well-being of people within our communities,\" said LaFonda D. Sutton-Burke, the office's director of field operations.\n\nSutton-Burke is on the money. The vaping industry is linked to negative health impacts, particularly among young people whom the products often target. Getting them hooked on tobacco comes with severe long-term risks.\n\nMeanwhile, vapes are a menace to the environment due to their mishmash of components. The improper disposal of single-use plastics, toxic e-waste, and lithium batteries they are composed of poses a major challenge.\n\nWhen tossed out into nature, they can leach dangerous chemicals, be a hazard to tires and machinery, and be ingested by animals. When placed in trash or recycling bins, they pose a serious fire risk at landfills or recycling facilities.\n\nThere is encouraging news in the U.S., as increased education and awareness of vaping's health risks seem to be resonating among teenagers and reducing their use. Still, experts are worried about the impact of potential funding cuts.\n\nUndoubtedly, keeping illegal products off the streets, as the CBP did here, is another way to combat vaping.\n\nDo you think the U.S. should tax goods from China?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nAfter the latest seizure, the CBP remained steadfast in its mission to catch other would-be offenders.\n\n\"We will continue to work with our consumer product safety partners to identify and seize unsafe and illicit goods,\" Sutton-Burke concluded.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "A cardiac expert has warned he is “seriously concerned” about President Donald Trump’s health after watching his “manic” address to the nation.\n\nDr. Jonathan Reiner, a medical analyst for CNN who served as the late Vice President Dick Cheney’s cardiologist for over 30 years, posted a series of alarmed statements on X as Trump delivered his accelerated address.\n\nTrump sped through the 18-minute address, often taking an angry tone, and occasionally shouting the words he was reading off a teleprompter.\n\n“The pace of this address is manic,” Reiner wrote, noting that the tone of the speech also did not match the Christmas decorations displayed behind Trump.\n\nThe president squeezed in a brief festive greeting at the end, without cracking a smile.\n\n“I’m seriously concerned about the health of the president,” Reiner said of the 79-year-old, adding that, “No one should be happy to see the president like this. He looks unwell.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.\n\nTrump’s health has been an ongoing concern this year, from his bruised hand to nodding off in Cabinet meetings.\n\nEarlier this month, Reiner fact-checked White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt when she announced that Trump’s second health check in a year included a “preventative MRI” to examine his heart and abdomen.\n\n“Well, there really is no preventative cardiac MRI,” Reiner said.\n\n“This is not a standard test for an 80-year-old man to undergo advanced imaging,” Reiner continued, saying the White House’s messaging had a “weird and defensive, evasive tone” to it.\n\nHe also pointed out that “preventative” abdominal imaging was especially peculiar.\n\n“This obviously was performed in response to some clinical concern, which is fine. Things happen to people as we all get older, and the president is almost 80,” said Reiner, who is a professor of medicine at George Washington University in D.C. “So, instead of this kind of evasive, almost laughable kind of note, just spell out what happened.\n\n“I hope the imaging is normal and great; that would be excellent news,” Reiner added. “But this kind of piece-by-piece, drip-by-drip release of information is just concerning.”\n\nThe breakneck pace and loud volume of Trump’s speech was also discussed on CNN’s NewsNight on Wednesday.\n\nOne theory is that CBS factored in a maximum 22-minute presidential interruption for Trump’s speech as part of the three-hour Survivor finale, which is always a ratings hit.\n\n“He was loud, he was forceful, he was fast,” author and journalist Terry Moran said of Trump.\n\n“The networks only gave him 15 minutes, supposedly. And that is a problem for him because he likes to ramble, he likes to improvise, and he sounded like a man shouting at the nation that entire time.”\n\nMoran said while Trump listed off “great things” he had done for the economy, “the facts of people’s own lives will refute you.”\n\n“I thought that was a huge mistake,” Moran said. “People think this economy is very bad for them personally and he’s shouting at them.”\n\nCNN political analyst and co-host on The View Ana Navarro said the speech was “18 minutes of their lives” people would never get back.\n\n“It was an angry old man shouting from the hills, shouting at the kids to get off their lawn,” Navarro said.\n\nShe said, “He interrupted the finale of Survivor, which has 4.5 million viewers. There’s a lot of Survivor fans for this old man to come and scream about how everything is great.”",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump suspended the green card lottery program on Thursday that allowed the suspect in the Brown University and MIT shootings to come to the United States.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a post on the social platform X that, at Trump’s direction, she is ordering the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to pause the program.\n\n“This heinous individual should never have been allowed in our country,” she said of the suspect, Portuguese national Claudio Neves Valente.\n\nNeves Valente, 48, is suspected in the shootings at Brown University that killed two students and wounded nine others, and the killing of an MIT professor. He was found dead Thursday evening from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, officials said.\n\nNeves Valente had studied at Brown on a student visa beginning in 2000, according to an affidavit from a Providence police detective. In 2017, he was issued a diversity immigrant visa and months later obtained legal permanent residence status, according to the affidavit. It was not immediately clear where he was between taking a leave of absence from the school in 2001 and getting the visa in 2017.\n\nThe diversity visa program makes up to 50,000 green cards available each year by lottery to people from countries that are little represented in the U.S., many of them in Africa. The lottery was created by Congress, and the move is almost certain to invite legal challenges.\n\nNearly 20 million people applied for the 2025 visa lottery, with more than 131,000 selected when including spouses with the winners. After winning, they must undergo vetting to win admission to the United States. Portuguese citizens won only 38 slots.\n\nLottery winners are invited to apply for a green card. They are interviewed at consulates and subject to the same requirements and vetting as other green-card applicants.\n\nTrump has long opposed the diversity visa lottery. Noem’s announcement is the latest example of using tragedy to advance immigration policy goals. After an Afghan man was identified as the gunman in a fatal attack on National Guard members in November, Trump’s administration imposed sweeping rules against immigration from Afghanistan and other counties.\n\nWhile pursuing mass deportation, Trump has sought to limit or eliminate avenues to legal immigration. He has not been deterred if they are enshrined in law, like the diversity visa lottery, or the Constitution, as with a right to citizenship for anyone born on U.S. soil. The Supreme Court recently agreed to hear his challenge to birthright citizenship.",

    "fullText": "Charlie Munger didn't believe in shortcuts — but he did believe in thresholds. And if you ever asked how to get rich, he had a number ready: $100,000. Hit that, he said, and you'll have the momentum to keep going. Fail to hit it, and you'll spin your wheels forever.\n\nMunger, who died in 2023 just weeks shy of his 100th birthday, was best known as Warren Buffett's blunt, brilliant right hand — but he built a billion-dollar fortune of his own by focusing on what worked and ignoring what didn't.\n\nOne piece of wisdom that resonates with investors is his take on building wealth. In the late 1990s, during a shareholder meeting, Munger said, “The first $100,000 is a b****, but you gotta do it.”\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nThis statement emphasizes the initial hurdle many face in accumulating savings. Munger’s bluntness highlights the challenge of reaching that critical first $100,000.\n\n“I don’t care what you have to do,\" he said. \"If it means walking everywhere and not eating anything that wasn’t purchased with a coupon, find a way to get your hands on $100,000.\"\n\nThe reason behind Munger’s focus on this initial amount? The power of compounding. Once you have that base, the path to greater wealth becomes smoother. With compounding returns, $100,000 can grow significantly over time, providing a strong foundation for long-term financial goals.\n\n“After that, you can ease off the gas a little bit,” he said.\n\nTrending: $100k+ in investable assets? Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes – no cost, no obligation.\n\nMunger made this statement in the mid-1990s, and when adjusted for inflation, $100,000 at the time is roughly equivalent to about $200,000 in 2025 dollars, based on U.S. consumer price index data. The number itself has shifted with time, but the idea behind it has not. The first meaningful pool of capital is still the hardest to assemble, and everything that follows depends on clearing that initial hurdle.\n\nThat belief stayed with Munger until the end of his life. In 2023, during one of his final long-form interviews discussed on the \"Acquired\" podcast, he summed up the payoff of that early grind in a single line: \"You only have to get rich once.\" The remark reflected a theme he returned to repeatedly over decades — build a durable financial base one time, and the rest of your decisions become less constrained.",

    "fullText": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee's governor pardoned country star Jelly Roll on Thursday for his criminal past in the state, acknowledging the Nashville native's long road back from drugs and prison through soul-searching, songwriting and advocacy for second chances.\n\nThe rapper-turned-singer whose legal name is Jason Deford has spoken for years about his redemption arc before diverse audiences, from people serving time in correctional centers to concert crowds and even in testimony before Congress.\n\nRepublican Gov. Bill Lee issued the pardon after friends and civic leaders of the Grammy-nominated musician joined in an outpouring of support.\n\nJelly Roll's convictions include robbery and drug felonies. He has said a pardon would make it easier for him to travel internationally for concert tours and to perform Christian missionary work without filling out burdensome paperwork.\n\nHe was one of 33 people to receive pardons Thursday from Lee, who for years has issued clemency decisions around the Christmas season. Lee said Jelly Roll’s application underwent the same monthslong thorough review as other applicants. The state parole board gave a nonbinding, unanimous recommendation for Jelly Roll's pardon in April.\n\n“His story is remarkable, and it’s a redemptive, powerful story, which is what you look for and what you hope for,” Lee told reporters.\n\nJelly Roll and Lee meet at the governor's mansion\n\nLee said he never met Jelly Roll until Thursday, when the musician visited the governor's mansion over the pardon news. The two hugged in front of a lit Christmas tree and a fireplace decorated with holiday garlands.\n\nUnlike recent high-profile federal pardons, which let people off the hook for prison, a Tennessee pardon serves as a statement of forgiveness for someone who has already completed a prison sentence. Pardons offer a path to restoring certain civil rights such as the right to vote, although there are some legal limitations, and the governor can specify the terms.\n\nJelly Roll broke into country music with the 2023 album “Whitsitt Chapel” and crossover songs like “Need a Favor.” He has won multiple CMT Awards, a CMA Award and also picked up seven career Grammy nominations.\n\nMuch of his music deals with overcoming adversity, like the song “Winning Streak” about someone’s first day sober. Or the direct-and-to-the-point, “I Am Not Okay.”\n\n\"When I first started doing this, I was just telling my story of my broken self,” he told The Associated Press in an interview. “By the time I got through it, I realized that my story was the story of many. So now I’m not telling my story anymore. I’m getting to pull it right from the crevices of the people whose story’s never been told.”\n\nJelly Roll: '‘I was a part of the problem’\n\nBefore the parole board, Jelly Roll said he first fell in love with songwriting while in custody, calling music a therapeutic passion project that “would end up changing my life in ways that I never dreamed imaginable.”\n\nOutside of sold-out shows, he's testified before the U.S. Senate about the dangers of fentanyl, describing his drug-dealing younger self as “the uneducated man in the kitchen playing chemist with drugs I knew absolutely nothing about.”\n\n“I was a part of the problem,” he told lawmakers at the time. “I am here now standing as a man that wants to be a part of the solution.”\n\nJelly Roll's most serious convictions include a robbery at 17 and drug charges at 23. In the first case, a female acquaintance helped Jelly Roll and two armed accomplices steal $350 from people in a home in 2002. Because the victims knew the female acquaintance, she and Jelly Roll were quickly arrested. Jelly Roll was unarmed, and was sentenced to one year in prison plus probation.\n\nIn another run-in 2008, police found marijuana and crack cocaine in his car, leading to eight years of court-ordered supervision.\n\nSheriff whose jail held Jelly Roll urged a pardon\n\nFriends and civic leaders cited his transformation in backing a pardon.\n\nDavidson County Sheriff Daron Hall, who runs Nashville’s jail, wrote that Jelly Roll had an awakening in one of the jails he managed. Live Nation Entertainment CEO and President Michael Rapino cited Jelly Roll's donations from his performances to charities for at-risk youth.\n\n“I think he has a chance and is in the process of rehabilitating a generation, and that’s not just words,” Hall said in a phone interview Thursday. \"I’m talking about what I see we need in our country, is people who accept responsibility, accept the fact that they make mistakes and accept the fact that they need help.\"\n\nThe parole board began considering Jelly Roll’s pardon application in October 2024, which marks the state's five-year timeline for eligibility after his sentence expired. Prominent Nashville attorney David Raybin represented Jelly Roll in the pardon case.\n\nLee's office said no one was pardoned Thursday who had a homicide or a sex-related conviction, or for any crime committed as an adult against a minor.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI is the latest to make a political hire as big tech spreads its tentacles around the world. So what’s the attraction?\n\nGeorge Osborne getting a new job isn’t exactly news. Since leaving frontline politics, the former chancellor has served as the chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, edited (not entirely successfully) the Evening Standard, advised asset manager BlackRock, joined boutique advisory firm Robey Warshaw, been appointed as the chair of the British Museum and taken on roles including advising crypto firm Coinbase. Oh, and like any white man of a particular age, he co-hosts a political podcast.\n\nBut Osborne’s latest job is the most eye-opening – and is an alarming augur of what is to come. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, has become the latest organisation to employ Osborne. He will run OpenAI for Countries, a unit tasked with working directly with governments while expanding the company’s Stargate datacentre programme beyond the US. At least it was announced with a tweet, rather than a LinkedIn post.\n\nThe tweet prompted jokes, as did Osborne’s single-handed attempt to boost laggard employment figures brought about by his policies as the chancellor of austerity. But it’s a serious moment, because it’s another sign that the biggest AI firms are starting to behave less like normal companies and more like quasi-governments. They’re negotiating “national” partnerships, pitching a values-led vision of “democratic AI” and hiring former senior politicians as their diplomatic corps. It’s a similar path we have seen from other industries, including oil, pharma and defence, in previous decades – which is why it’s important to try to recognise the risks and head them off before AI companies can repeat the same trick.\n\nThe initiative Osborne is heading up, OpenAI for Countries, does what it says on the tin. It’s designed to embed OpenAI’s models and infrastructure inside the machinery of states, becoming an invaluable, indefatigable part of the running of our lives. OpenAI is in talks with about 50 countries to provide them with critical national infrastructure. Whether you welcome Osborne being put in that role rather than a tech executive is a little like Hobson’s choice: who do you distrust the least? But it’s an indication of how tech companies see their position in society that they are hiring such high-powered people for these roles.\n\nOsborne is not the first to don the branded hoodie and Silicon Valley lifestyle. His fellow coalition government bod Nick Clegg blazed the trail as head of global affairs for Meta. At the time of his initial hiring as a vice-president at Facebook in 2018, his appointment was treated as a PR move – a big name to help the company navigate scandal and scrutiny. But it hinted that platforms had become political actors, whether they liked it or not. The industry’s outsized spending on lobbyists (€151m in Europe alone at the last count) to support the political beasts is an indication of what is at stake. The numbers involved also hint at the scale of the prize that tech companies see: the 10 largest big tech firms now outspend the biggest 10 companies in the pharma, finance and automotive industries combined.\n\nThe former chancellor isn’t even the first former controller of the UK public purse to be handy to big tech. In October of this year, Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Microsoft and the AI firm Anthropic, less than two years after he convened the AI safety summit at Bletchley Park. Sunak, at least, already had the regulation hoodie in his wardrobe.\n\nYou can read these moves in two ways. The generous interpretation is that these companies are hedging: trying to anticipate tech regulation and ensure they understand it. The more cynical interpretation is that they are attempting to shape the geopolitical story around AI from inside the machine, hiring former leaders less for their technical insight than their institutional muscle memory and networks.\n\nEither way, it leaves democracies with a problem. Governments are supposed to set the rules of the road. But the tech companies they are meant to regulate are on a different scale, planting their feet in different countries. When Sunak convened the Bletchley Park summit, it was notable that he turned interviewer to quiz Elon Musk, sitting starry-eyed on stage as Musk dominated the discourse.\n\nIt’s time to recognise these companies are acting like political actors. That means it’s time to treat them like political actors, too. We need more transparency: governments signing up to OpenAI for Countries agreements should publish the details of their partnerships by default. We should also ask more questions about infrastructure dependence. Governments love Stargate-style investments in their countries, and want to be able to don a hard hat, cut a ribbon and issue a press release. But if they are in effect a new layer of national backbone, they should be studied more closely – as if they are utilities, rather than receive the good grace of a startup-style mystique.\n\nThe more tech companies start to act like politicians and global leaders, the more we need to treat them like it. That doesn’t mean deference; it means more scepticism and journalistic interrogation.\n\nChris Stokel-Walker is the author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World’s Favourite App",

    "fullText": "Minister says ‘any individual’ at low risk from hack, while Sun reports Chinese cyber gang responsible for breach\n\nThe UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office was hacked in October, the minister Chris Bryant has said.\n\nBryant, a trade minister in Keir Starmer’s government, told Sky News there was a low risk to “any individual” from the cyber-attack.\n\nDetails of the hack emerged on Friday in a report by the Sun that claimed a Chinese hacker group was behind the cyber-attack.\n\nHowever, Bryant told broadcasters it was “not clear” who perpetrated the attack and cautioned against speculation. “There certainly has been a hack at the FCDO and we’ve been aware of that since October,” Bryant told Sky News.\n\n“And just as you will have been reporting earlier on this year on the cyber hack at JLR [Jaguar Land Rover] and at Marks & Spencer, and earlier last year, I think it was at the British Library, all of these are really important things for us to tackle and be aware of and prevent wherever possible.\n\n“Some of the reporting has, I think, been a bit more speculation than accurate.”\n\nBryant said: “Quite often the investigation takes quite a long time to get down to that. We managed to close the hole, as it were, very quickly. There was a technical issue in one of our sites, I gather, and we’re fairly confident that there’s a low risk of any individual actually being affected by this.\n\n“I know that some of the reports have said potentially various things could happen. I think that’s a bit more speculation than is helpful. So I don’t want to scaremonger about this. We are on top of it. And also, it’s not entirely clear where this has come from. I know everybody’s speculating about that as well. It’s that that is not entirely clear either.”\n\nAsked if China was behind the attack, Bryant said: “That’s not entirely clear.”\n\nThe Sun named Storm 1849 as the Chinese cyber gang responsible for the breach, which it said was understood to possibly include tens of thousands of visa details.\n\n The group has been “accused of targeting politicians and groups critical of the Chinese government”, the newspaper said.\n\nA government spokesperson told the Guardian: “We have been working to investigate a cyber incident. We take the security of our systems and data extremely seriously.”",

The TikTok chief executive officer, Shou Zi Chew, said in the memo that ByteDance and TikTok have signed binding agreements with the three investors.\n\nThe new TikTok US joint venture will be 50% held by a consortium of new investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX with 15% each. Another 30.1% will be held by affiliates of existing ByteDance investors and 19.9% will be retained by ByteDance, according to the memo.\n\nWhite House officials have said Oracle, which was co-founded by Donald Trump’s supporter Larry Ellison, will license a copy of TikTok’s recommendation algorithm as part of the deal, in a partnership that will expand on Oracle’s existing management of TikTok’s trove of data collected about its US users.\n\nEllison’s role in the new ownership of the most popular social media platform in the US has raised concerns about the decreasing share of media firms not under the control of pro-Trump billionaires, with Ellison’s son David now driving wholesale changes at CBS, Elon Musk in control of X, formerly known as Twitter, Mark Zuckerberg overseeing both Instagram and Facebook, and Jeff Bezos owning the Washington Post.\n\n“First Paramount/CBS and now TikTok,” Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, wrote on Bluesky in response to the news. “Trump wants to hand over even more control of what you watch to his billionaire buddies. Americans deserve to know if the president struck another backdoor deal for this billionaire takeover of TikTok.”\n\nRush Doshi, who coordinated US government policy on China and Taiwan as a Biden National Security Council official, noted that there were “still some questions about who controls the algorithm. They say it will be trained on US data. Great, but has the algorithm been transferred, licensed, or is it still owned and controlled by Beijing – with Oracle merely providing ‘monitoring?’”\n\nThe agreement comes after a long delay. Trump said in September that he had spoken with China’s president over the phone about the deal and he had “a very good talk with president Xi” and “he gave us the go ahead”.\n\nIn October, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, announced that the US and China had “reached a final deal on TikTok”.\n\nIn 2020, during his first presidency, Trump had threatened to ban TikTok in retaliation for China’s handling of Covid.\n\nCongress later passed a ban of the app over security concerns that was signed into law in April 2024 by Joe Biden. The ban was set to go into effect on 20 January 2025 but implementation was pushed back multiple times by Trump while his administration worked to develop a deal to transfer ownership.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "When AIs become consistently more capable than humans, life could change in strange ways. It could happen in the next few years, or a little longer. If and when it comes, our domestic routines – trips to the doctor, farming, work and justice systems – could all look very different. Here we take a look at how the era of artificial general intelligence might feel\n“Does it hurt when I do this?”\n Continue reading...",
    "fullText": "A Eye: “NOOOO! The problem is a sprain in the brachial plexus due to you lifting that 10kg carton on Wednesday at 2.58pm and not eating enough blah blah”\n\nIn 2035, AIs are more than co-pilots in medicine, they have become the frontline for much primary care. Gone is the early morning scramble to get through to a harassed GP receptionist for help. Patients now contact their doctor’s AI to explain their ailments. It quickly cross-checks the information against the patient’s medical history and provides a pre-diagnosis, putting the human GP in a position to decide what to do next.\n\nIn face-to-face consultations an AI may listen in the background, weigh the facts of the patient’s case against thousands of medical studies, propose a course of drugs based on the full depth of the latest medical research, which the human doctor could never fully digest. It provides a second opinion for the doctor, who can assess its proposals before deciding how to act.\n\nThe public may not be wholly averse to this change. Thirty-eight per cent of people favour using AI to speed up triage in the NHS although 52% prefer humans, citing trust and wanting personal interaction, polling by Ipsos in October 2025 found.\n\nMedical screening becomes highly sophisticated and perhaps a little invasive. Doctors could be sent details of your diet and vital statistics tracked by wearable devices. Smart toilets may even analyse your bowel movements. Medicines could be produced exactly tailored to your body and its needs.\n\nIf it all works, diseases are spotted quicker and medicines are more accurately prescribed, but the combination of one AI and one human medic creates a new tension. The best doctors become those most adept at interpreting the outputs of the AIs. Medical schools change their teachings to focus more on managing AI medics, and politicians wrestle with how to overhaul medical regulation and ethics.\n\nThe rivals racing to create super-intelligence. This was put together in\n collaboration with the Editorial Design team. Read more from the series.\n\nJustice is increasingly enabled by AI, although some fear it is taking over. Solicitors preparing for trial have learned to delegate the legwork of unearthing case law and planning arguments to an AI, which proposes the best approach for a barrister to take in court. The current problems of AIs making up case law, as happened at least 95 times in July and August, according to trackers, have been ironed out. The new, more robust artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems compress days of work into hours, leaving the human solicitor only to check the AI’s brief to the human barrister.\n\nNext, amid a courts backlog, pressure grows to largely replace barristers too. An experiment is launched allowing adversarial AIs to argue cases in front of a human judge and jury. The results prove compelling. Cases are concluded at a fraction of the cost to the taxpayer and much faster. But numerous miscarriages of justice soon emerge. Campaigners for people wrongly imprisoned begin to demand greater transparency about the inner workings and biases of the AI lawyers.\n\nHaving unleashed AGI, governments and companies have to constantly surveil the autonomous systems, employing people to sit at banks of screens, shutting down dangerous behaviour, dispatching good AIs to hunt down bad AIs.\n\nWAIT! … Were there any eggs in the fridge?!\n\nHe’s asleep now, I can’t ask him.\n\nHe’s clumsy when he hasn’t eaten his breakfast eggs.\n\nWhat if he drops me? Replaces me?! There’s a new set of glasses out tomorrow!!!\n\nWearable AI devices, such as glasses, watches and rings, have become ubiquitous. They function as extra senses, spotting things in our environment that we miss, like a lack of eggs in the fridge, or recording our interactions to remind us later of things we forget. But then they also start to do things for us – and maybe even worry about not doing a good enough job.\n\n“First principle is, you have a bunch of these AI agents that do things for you,” says David Shrier, professor of practice, AI and innovation at Imperial Business School. “These will be specially programmed AIs that have different areas of expertise and are customised – adapted to you and your specific needs. So they learn … what you want and they go and do it for you.”\n\nYou might start your day with the help of an information agent. “It goes out, it curates the articles and when you wake up in the morning and as you are brushing your teeth, it’s reading out to you summaries and interpretation of the news. It can provide some deeper understanding for you.”\n\nThis second-guessing based on deep algorithmic familiarity extends to your breakfast. If you have been wearing augmented reality glasses, the AI will have noticed when you opened the fridge that you’ve run out of eggs. When you go downstairs at 7am your phone lights up to say an Amazon drone has delivered you some eggs.\n\nShrier adds that all of this requires consent, meaning “you know what you are allowing the AI to understand and know about you, and you get to easily opt out if you don’t want your data shared.”\n\nA farmer’s rounds, checking on the health of livestock, crops, feed supplies and machinery – which can take from dawn to dusk – become far less onerous. With cameras and sensors rigged to trees, barns, fence posts and itinerant robots, every farm delivers a torrent of data to help increase productivity and animal welfare. Already, in 2025, an AI model is under development to detect early infections in cows by tracking subtle shifts in their social behaviour. A herd in Somerset is being filmed around the clock to train a model to predict if an animal is in the early stages of mastitis, which affects milk production and is an animal welfare problem. A decade later and with data harnessed from millions of farms around the world, AGI advises not only what to plant and when, but how to build stronger ecosystems, and improve soil health. AGI-powered robots could stalk the fields rooting out weeds and reducing the need for herbicides.\n\n… and this was called an office …\n\nFilled with people and chairs and phones and desks and carpet and water coolers and paper\n\nSports clubs, live entertainment venues and travel agents boom as AGI transforms work, helping millions of white-collar workers whisk through their tasks leaving time for a new life of leisure – at least that is one theory.\n\nIn the early years of AGI only a few people are made fully redundant by full automation, and most stay in work. For a while people retain the same 40-hour working week and simply get more work done.\n\nAt work, AI could act like a “buddy” or a coach in meetings, says Shrier. It might advise you to go easy on another attender because they look a little stressed.\n\n“During your meeting you’re getting this sort of coaching and augmentation that makes you better at interacting.” As the chat ends, the AI sends you a list of next steps to take following this meeting – and slots it into your project plan. As you get to your desk, your professional AI assistant is bringing you the documents and spreadsheets you need to deliver.\n\nAI-augmented economies could grow sharply. But soon people realise they can afford to work less. The 15-hour week, which the economist John Maynard Keynes in 1930 predicted would happen by 2030, becomes a reality. Leisure becomes less about rest and orientates towards creative activities, human-to-human socialising and time caring for children or elderly family members, academics have suggested.\n\n“If you believe the premise that humans are social animals, they’re going to have to do something,” the US sports and entertainment mogul Ari Emanuel said in October as he announced new investments in live entertainment. “They can’t just sit at home, so they’ll go to music, they’ll go to sports and they’ll go to my live events.”\n\nBut the shift to more spare time also creates a new problem: mass boredom. A generation conditioned for the nine to five and which had derived satisfaction from now-automated tasks such as populating spreadsheets or writing reports, struggles to adjust. Some people take to the new leisure like happy retirees and report increased wellbeing, but others struggle with mental health problems.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United got a first-hand glimpse of Antoine Semenyo on Monday, with the January window drawing ever closer.\n\nUnder the lights at Old Trafford, the Ghanaian scored the first of Bournemouth’s three equalisers on the night, with the pulsating encounter eventually ending 4-4.\n\nWith the goal, the “special” 25-year-old now has seven goals and three assists this season, and is currently the third top-scorer in the Premier League.\n\nNaturally, plenty of clubs are eyeing the Cherries talisman, and the list includes the likes of United, Manchester City, Liverpool, and Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nBoth the Red Devils and their noisy neighbours had called Bournemouth to understand the viability of a January deal.\n\nGiven City’s current position in the league table, and the guarantee of playing Champions League football, the Ghana international could have opted to switch to the Etihad.\n\nHowever, as per The Daily Telegraph, there are murmurs that Pep Guardiola might step down, come the end of the season. And that strengthens United’s chances of landing the versatile attacker.\n\n“Manchester United will go all-out to sign Antoine Semenyo in January and hope the uncertainty over Pep Guardiola’s future could strengthen their hand.\n\n“United are locked in a four way tussle with Manchester City, Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool for the coveted Bournemouth forward, whose £65m release clause activates from the start of next month.\n\n“Semenyo, 25, is in huge demand and has a big decision to make as he plots his next career move.\n\n“City want Semenyo but United are among the suitors out to take advantage of the doubts about whether Guardiola will still be at the Etihad Stadium beyond the end of this season.”\n\nAs for Liverpool, they can only advance once the Mohamed Salah situation becomes clearer.\n\nThus, United are in an advantageous position if they plan to launch an assault early in the winter window. Antoine Semenyo has a release clause of £65 million.\n\nWith Bryan Mbeumo, and Amad set to be unavailable due to AFCON, United have a readymade replacement. Now, whether INEOS can afford to pounce will be interesting to see.\n\nFeature image Lewis Storey via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

SAUBERT. @SEAHAWKS WIN! pic.twitter.com/VF2QElidFV\n\nThis year is the first season in which regular season overtime does not automatically end on an opening drive offensive touchdown. The only difference between regular season and playoff overtime (which eliminated “offensive touchdown on first possession wins the game” starting in the 2022 season) is that regular season OT is still just 10 minutes and not 15. Barring a defensive or special teams touchdown (or a safety), both offenses must possess the ball at least once.\n\nThe catalyst for this change was the famous Kansas City Chiefs vs. Buffalo Bills AFC Divisional playoff classic in the 201 season, in which Josh Allen never touched the ball in overtime and the Chiefs scored a touchdown on the first possession and never looked back.\n\nWhile we’ve yet to see an opening drive overtime touchdown under the current rules in the playoffs, this is the first time that a team has conceded an overtime touchdown and come back to win the game. The Jacksonville Jaguars scored a touchdown against the Las Vegas Raiders earlier this season, only for the Raiders to respond with their own. Geno Smith’s winning pass to Tyler Lockett was batted down and Jacksonville won.\n\nIt’s only fitting that such a weird thing would first be done by the Seahawks. We expect nothing less.",

    "fullText": "At the start of this Women’s Champions League campaign, Chelsea did not look like a side ready to challenge for their first European title.\n\nA disappointing 1-1 draw with Twente on matchday one highlighted the weaknesses that threatened to prevent Sonia Bompastor’s side finally adding the Champions League to their trophy cabinet. They wasted chance after chance, were exposed by a simple direct attack, and lacked the composure needed to come from behind and secure three points.\n\nThat opening performance could have set a worrying tone for their European campaign. Instead, Chelsea have recovered to finish third in the inaugural league phase and qualify automatically for the quarter-finals, scoring 20 goals in six games and remaining unbeaten. Only eight-time winners OL Lyonnes and three-time champions Barcelona have also avoided defeat.\n\nChelsea’s grip on the Women’s Super League (WSL) title is loosening, with Manchester City six points clear at the top — but a blip in their domestic dominance would almost certainly be forgiven by the fans if they secured the one trophy missing from their cabinet.\n\nThe Champions League’s changed format has provided valuable clues about their credentials. The benefit of the league phase is that Chelsea have had the opportunity to learn their lessons early. In the past, the gap between Europe’s elite sides and the rest has often meant a relatively straightforward group phase.\n\nLast season, Chelsea won all six of their games against Twente, Celtic, and Real Madrid. By the equivalent point this season, they have already faced Barcelona — who have knocked them out in the semi-finals three years in a row — and two-time winners Wolfsburg, who have reached at least the semi-final in three of the past six seasons.\n\nChelsea’s problem in Europe in recent years has not been the quality of their squad, but their ability to outmuscle or outsmart fellow heavyweights in the knockout stages. Early evidence suggests they are overcoming that.\n\nThey drew 1-1 with Barcelona at Stamford Bridge, a massive improvement on their humiliating 8-2 semi-final aggregate defeat in April. That came down largely to a more mature tactical approach: Bompastor set her team up to immobilise Barcelona’s midfield and prevent them playing through the central corridor. Chelsea were not at their most eye-catching attacking best, but their discipline paid off as they became the only team to take points from Barcelona in the league phase.\n\nAgainst Wolfsburg, their maturity showed again. Chelsea do not often have to come from behind, but Alexandra Popp’s header after 16 minutes gave Wolfsburg a deserved lead and forced Chelsea to respond.\n\nChelsea had been physically stronger, better competitors in duels, and posed a more direct threat on the counter-attack. This was where Chelsea’s depth paid off: Bompastor was able to tweak the set-up to add more defensive nous in the midfield through Sjoeke Nusken replacing Lauren James at half-time, and refreshed the right flank by bringing on Johanna Rytting Kaneryd for Ellie Carpenter 10 minutes later.\n\nBoth changes proved astute, particularly when Rytting Kaneryd provided the assist for Sam Kerr’s winning goal that secured the 2-1 win. In the second half, Chelsea were much better at stopping turnovers high up the pitch becoming Wolfsburg counter-attacks. Lucy Bronze reaching a Wolfsburg clearance before Lineth Beerensteyn turned what would have been a threatening counter into the move that produced Kerr’s winner.\n\nIt is crucial that Chelsea stop the wastefulness that has cost them in the WSL from creeping into their European campaign. That sounds a harsh thing to say about a side who scored the joint-most goals in the league phase, and whose underlying numbers show they were worthy of those goals.\n\nHowever, as goals will inevitably become harder to score in the knockout stages, being clinical will be even more important. Roma, for example, gave away several goals cheaply by either not closing down Chelsea’s attackers or by leaving them unmarked in dangerous positions.\n\nArsenal, Wolfsburg, Juventus, or OL Lyonnes — all of whom could pop up on Chelsea’s potential path to the final — will not yield chances so easily. That was on show against Barcelona, where Bompastor admitted her frustration at the chances Chelsea missed to take all three points.\n\nTheir display against Wolfsburg was much more promising. Kerr, Erin Cuthbert, and James all missed in front of goal, but Chelsea had nine of their 16 shots on target — a significant improvement on their domestic form — and will need to maintain such numbers to progress to the final.\n\nThere are lessons from this league stage, too. Loose passes in midfield handed Wolfsburg many of their early opportunities, culminating in Livia Peng’s poor ball out from the back from which Popp got the better of Keira Walsh and scored the opener.\n\nThe other question is whether Bompastor would take a more controlled, patient approach in knockout games. It paid off against Barcelona, but that was in a league-phase game where the risks and rewards were lower for both teams.\n\nIn the closing stage of a knockout match, would Bompastor want her side to be so patient? This team’s identity is all about attack and using their expensively assembled, Hydra-like forward line to cut through opponents. How long would they be able to resist the temptation to take the handbrake off?\n\nThursday’s knockout draw has revealed their path to the final: a quarter-final against either Arsenal or OH Leuven, followed by a semi-final where they could face Wolfsburg, Juventus, or Lyon. Barcelona are on the other side of the bracket, so if Chelsea are to face them again, it would be in the final.\n\nChelsea have time to mull this over.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nChelsea, Champions League, Women's Soccer\n\n2025 The Athletic Media Company",

The main event ringwalks are tentatively scheduled for around 10:30 p.m. ET / 7:30 p.m. PT, depending on how long the highly anticipated undercard fights last.\n\nJoshua (28-4, 25 KOs) is a former two-time unified heavyweight champion, an Olympic Gold medalist, and one of the biggest names in boxing. He is returning to the ring after a knockout loss to Daniel Dubois last year and subsequent elbow surgery. Despite the layoff, Joshua enters the fight as the significant betting favorite, looking to quickly dispatch the controversial star and prove he is still an elite contender.\n\nPaul (12-1, 7 KOs) is taking the most significant risk of his boxing career, moving up to heavyweight to face his first legitimate, active, and credentialed professional boxer. Paul, who is coming off his highly-publicized exhibition with Mike Tyson last year, has primarily faced former MMA stars. He is hoping to leverage his speed, power, and high ring IQ to overcome the massive size and experience disparity against Joshua, looking to shock the world in one of the biggest events in combat sports history.\n\nThe fight has captured global attention and is expected to bring in a record-breaking viewing audience for Netflix, as Paul believes he will deliver an emphatic upset and end Joshua's championship aspirations.\n\nMORE: Is Floyd Mayweather fighting Mike Tyson?\n\nAlycia Baumgardner (c) vs. Leila Beaudoin\n\nIBF, WBO, and WBA Super Featherweight Titles\n\nAnderson Silva vs. Tyron Woodley\n\nCruiserweight (195 lbs.

    "fullText": "The Maccabi Tel Aviv big man does it all. From scoring, dunking, blocking, and rebounding, the Minsk, Belarus-born Sorkin has continued to carve out a rise to the top.\n\nIt’s clear that Roman Sorkin has become the next Israeli Euroleague superstar.\n\nThe Maccabi Tel Aviv big man does it all. From scoring, dunking, blocking, and rebounding, the Minsk, Belarus-born Sorkin has continued to carve out a rise to the top.\n\nThe 29-year-old has developed into a bona fide superstar who can play at the highest level, drawing interest from NBA clubs, as the one-time Oregon Duck center who barely saw the floor in college has become one of the local greats.\n\nIn Maccabi Tel Aviv’s first Euroleague game back in Israel since the start of the October 7, 2023 war, Sorkin proved to be unstoppable in scoring 26 points to match Yotam Halperin’s record for a Sabra in the continent’s top competition.\n\nSorkin, who played for Maccabi Haifa beginning in the 2017/18 season after finishing his time at Oregon, moved to the yellow-and-blue for the 2021/22 campaign and has slowly but surely turned into a dominant force and one that head coach Oded Katash has not rushed along prematurely.\n\nIn his debut Euroleague campaign, Sorkin averaged only 8.3 minutes per game, but then doubled that output in the following two seasons. This year, he’s putting in 22 minutes per game and scoring 14 points in those contests while loving every second of it.\n\nDespite his age, Katash believes that Sorkin is still developing and has even better days ahead.\n\n“Usually, when talking about a player Roman’s age, even though he’s not old of course, you’re talking about a player who is foundational and I still think Roman has potential. I’ve coached many players throughout my career. I wouldn’t say the same things about all players at this stage of their careers. His ability to be more consistent and demand more of himself and continue to develop, that’s something he does. I’m very proud of him. As you know, I really admire him and it’s a great privilege for me to believe in him. I hope and wish that he will break many more records.”\n\nSorkin’s teammates revere him and only have the finest things to say about the center, including Tamir Blatt, who has been at Sorkin’s side for many years since their days with Israel’s youth national teams, as the guard was in awe of Sorkin’s points record.\n\n“That’s something else,” Blatt said. “I mean, he’s unique, you know. I’ve known Roman since we were 16 and to see the way he elevates his game every year and the level he’s playing is unbelievable. I’m just happy he’s my teammate.”\n\nOne of Sorkin’s front-court teammates, Marcio Santos, also spoke about what he sees the Israeli can bring to the table.\n\n“He brings experience and he knows how to play. He’s been playing in this league for years and he has been able to really help me by giving me tips, how to do this and how to do that. We’re learning how to play together as is the entire team. I think it’s a great thing for him to match the record. Everybody knows Roman is a great player, he’s a great guy off the court and of course on the court, he works hard and all of that is going to pay off.”\n\nWhen Sorkin found out that he had matched Halperin’s mark, he actually didn’t want to even believe it and credited his teammates.\n\n“Doron Jamchi has that, it’s a 40, no? Oh in the Euroleague, wow, I didn’t know, it’s a great honor, it’s an honor to be with Yotam, he’s an amazing player. Thank you to everyone on the team for everything they’ve done for me, thank you, I don’t play one on one, so thank you all here and I hope I can break this record as well.”\n\nThe game, which marked the first time Maccabi played in the Euroleague at its real home in Tel Aviv since October 5, 2023, when it beat Partizan, was an emotional one that Sorkin will not forget.\n\n“It’s amazing; we’re so happy to be back home, playing with our fans here back home is incredible. We’re really excited being home, playing in front of our crowd. We want to say thank you to everybody who let this happen once again and thank you to Belgrade for hosting us for so long, it’s something unbelievable.\n\n\"We just want to keep playing home. It’s so much fun to play at home and it’s so tough to beat us at home. Something about this arena, Yad Eliyahu, is that you’re just stepping into the energy and you can just feel it. I missed it and now it’s just going to get better and better.”\n\nBlatt also shared his thoughts about having the games return to Israel.\n\n“It was amazing. I mean, after two and a half years, going through so much, you know, as a team, also the country and now to be able to play with our fans, which, you know, they’re like our sixth man. We really needed it and the energy was amazing. It was just a big thrill. I really enjoyed it and I’m looking forward to many more.”\n\nKatash, too, shared his thoughts on the return of the Euroleague games to Israel and how emotional a moment it was to finally experience it again.\n\n“This wasn’t about basketball, it was above and beyond the game. It was really special for us. We were so emotional. I’m sure that each one of the players, staff, coaching staff and everyone around the club, it was really special for all of us. To experience that crazy and great atmosphere, playing in front of our fans finally a Euroleague game. That’s the most important thing and that’s why I feel like it’s really special.”\n\nSee more Israeli sports coverage at www.sportsrabbi.com/en",

    "fullText": "Jaxon Smith-Njigba sets Seahawks records in improbable comeback win vs. Rams originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks pulled off one of the most stunning comebacks in recent NFL history on Thursday night, defeating the Los Angeles Rams in overtime by a score of 38-37 after being down 16 points midway through the fourth quarter.\n\nSeattle scored 16 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to force the game into overtime. After the Rams scored a touchdown on the opening series of the overtime period, Sam Darnold and the Seahawks' offense put together a masterful game-winning drive, capped off by a Jaxon Smith-Nijigba touchdown and an Eric Saubert two-point conversion from Darnold to seal the deal.\n\nSpeaking of Smith-Nijigba, the superstar wide receiver turned in another productive outing versus the Rams, tallying eight receptions for 96 yards and the aforementioned touchdown.\n\nAlong with being a part of one of the greatest comebacks in Seahawks history, Smith-Nijigba etched himself in the franchise history books on Thursday.\n\nAfter an eight-catch performance, Smith-Nijigba broke the franchise record for most catches in a single season. The Ohio State product is now up to 104 receptions on the year, surpassing the previous record of 100, set by himself in 2024 and Tyler Lockett in 2020.\n\nSmith-Nijigba has had an Offensive Player of the Year-caliber season in 2025 and has established himself as one of the best players in the sport. The 23-year-old is top five in receptions, yards, and touchdowns among pass-catchers this year and leads the league in receiving yards with 1,627, which is also a Seahawks record.\n\nWith two games remaining in the season, Smith-Nijigba has the opportunity to solidify his case as the Offensive Player of the Year and a lock for a first-team All-Pro nod as well.

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Rams have authored quite the script thus far in 2025, but it remains to be seen how their story ends.\n\nSean McVay's bunch entered Week 16 in possession of the NFC's top seed in the playoff race, a coveted spot this time of year. With just three games to go, there wasn't a lot standing in the way of Matthew Stafford, Puka Nacua and Co.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks had something to say before the dust settled, however.\n\nSeattle's win in the two teams' Week 16 \"Thursday Night Football\" battle pushed the fate of the NFC playoff picture a bit further north, to northern California and the Pacific Northwest, as the Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers are now in control of their own destinies. The Rams are no longer able to clinch the No. 1 seed in the NFC just by winning out.\n\nMcVay's team won't have to worry about missing the postseason with the loss because it already clinched a spot in the dance. Now, it's about seeing which table Los Angeles will be seated at.\n\nHere's a look at the Rams' playoff odds, remaining schedule and overall NFC playoff picture:\n\nThe Rams already clinched a playoff spot last week, meaning they will be in the postseason regardless of their loss on \"Thursday Night Football\" in Week 16.\n\nThey entered the week in possession of the NFC's top seed, but their prime-time loss against the Seahawks pushed them from the No. 1 spot to No. 5 – the conference's top wild-card spot.\n\nThe loss put L.A. a game behind Seattle with just two weeks left. A win would have put the Rams in firm control of the NFC's top spot.\n\nThe Rams will face the NFL's second-easiest schedule the remainder of the season, per Tankathon. Their matchup against the Seahawks was the last against a team with a winning record before the postseason.\n\nLos Angeles will have to deal with a pair of NFC opponents that have been eliminated from playoff contention in the final few games:\n\nWeek 17: at Atlanta Falcons (Monday)\n\nThe NFC West is a tight race heading into the final three games. Here's how the standings look entering Week 16:\n\nSeattle Seahawks: 12-3 (3-2 in NFC West)\n\nSan Francisco 49ers: 10-4 (4-1)\n\nSeattle Seahawks (12-3; NFC West leaders)*\n\nChicago Bears (10-4; NFC North leaders)\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles (9-5; NFC East leaders)\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers (7-7; NFC South leaders)\n\nLos Angeles Rams (11-4; wild card No. 1)*\n\nSan Francisco 49ers (10-4; wild card No. 2)\n\nGreen Bay Packers (9-4-1; wild card No. 3)\n\nIn the hunt: Detroit Lions (8-6); Carolina Panthers (7-7); Dallas Cowboys (6-7-1)\n\nEliminated: Minnesota Vikings (6-8); Atlanta Falcons (5-9); New Orleans Saints (4-10); Washington Commanders (4-10); Arizona Cardinals (3-11); New York Giants (2-12)\n\nAn asterisk (*) denotes teams that have clinched a playoff spot.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Rams playoff chances, odds to make playoffs, NFC West standings",

    "description": "Puka Nacua posted a career-high 225 yards against the Seahawks. He had some words for the officials after the game.",
    "fullText": "Puka Nacua's bizarre week ended with him mad online, after the NFL's game of the year.\n\nRoughly two minutes after the Seattle Seahawks completed their comeback win over Nacua's Los Angeles Rams to take control of the NFC West, the star wide receiver fired off a tweet complaining about the game's officiating. The post was deleted minutes later.\n\n\"Can you say i was wrong. Appreciate you stripes for your contribution. Lol\" Nacua wrote.\n\nNacua posted it immediately after a career game against the Seahawks, with 12 catches, 225 receiving yards and two touchdowns on 12 targets, continuing an All-Pro level season for the third-year player. He later spoke with reporters and described it as a heated moment for himself:\n\n“It was just a lack of awareness. Just frustration.”\n\nRams head coach Sean McVay was also unaware of the tweet when speaking with reporters, declining to directly address the tweet but defending Nacua as \"a great kid that's continuing to learn about the platform he has.\"\n\nObviously, that tweet refers to the officials and Nacua's own past comments, which were part of a week that could be charitably described as eventful for the 24-year-old. During a livestream appearance on Tuesday, Nacua laid into the refs in a way virtually guaranteed to earn him a fine from the NFL:\n\n\"The refs are the worst,\" Nacua said. \"... Some of the rules aren't ... These guys want to be ... these guys are lawyers. They want to be on TV too. You don't think he's texting his friends in the group chat like, 'Yo, you guys just saw me on \"Sunday Night Football.\" That wasn't P.I., but I called it.'\"\n\nOverall, here's how the past couple weeks have played out for Nacua:\n\nDec. 7: Nacua gets caught livestreaming from a postgame locker room and is admonished by his teammates.\n\nDec. 13-14: Nacua's brother Samson is arrested for allegedly taking the car of a Los Angeles Lakers rookie without his consent.\n\nDec. 16, part 1: Nacua tries to get two streamers into the Rams' practice facility and is admonished by \"the boss man.\" Sean McVay denied he was said boss man on Thursday.\n\nDec. 16, part 2: Nacua goes live with said streamers, makes his comments about the officials, says concussions aren't real and pledges to do an antisemitic touchdown dance.\n\nDec. 17: Nacua's touchdown dance idea gains traction and criticism.\n\nDec. 18, part 1: Nacua apologizes for the antisemitic touchdown dance.\n\nDec. 18, part 2: Nacua sets a career high in receiving yards.\n\nDec. 18, part 3: Nacua posts then deletes the tweet.\n\nIt's not what you would call an ideal run from a player who will likely be seeking a long-term and high-priced contract extension from the Rams this offseason. However, his contributions Thursday also demonstrated how much the franchise needs him on the field.",

    "description": "The Seahawks opened the path for the 49ers to earn the No. 1 seed.",
    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks looked like a team that didn’t trust its quarterback. They were running the ball in situations perceived as passing. Sam Darnold threw two costly interceptions when Seattle let him throw. They couldn’t have happened at worse times.\n\nOn the flipside, Matthew Stafford and Puka Nacua of the Los Angeles Rams connected for 12 receptions and 225 yards, while Stafford threw for 457 yards and three touchdowns en route to 37 points.\n\nDarnold threw an interception as the Seahawks’ offense was driving. Not only did it take points off the board for Seattle, but the Los Angeles Rams were opportunistic enough to not only catch it, but return it inside the five-yard line. That was the second time in as many games Darnold gifted the Rams the ball inside near the goal line.\n\nSpeaking of the goal line, Darnold’s second interception came on a disguise he didn’t see coming. It was yet another opportunity squashed. The final straw came when Seattle called a pair of screen passes and ran it on a drive after they tied the score at 30.\n\nThe Seahawks’ defense kept them in it, which is odd to say for a team that allowed 30 points. As the game headed to overtime, the one way the 49ers could beat the Colts and not move ahead of Seattle was if the game ended in a tie. That’d be because the Seahawks would still be one up on the Niners in the loss column, at 11-3-1.\n\nA Seahawks loss would mean the 49ers would have the tiebreaker over the Seahawks with a Week 15 win over the Colts, as the 49ers hold the tiebreaker in the NFC West with four wins compared to Seattle’s two.\n\nWhat’s been glossed over is how gettable the Rams defense has been. Despite Darnold’s turnovers, the Seahawks found ways to move the ball. That didn’t change in overtime, and Darnold made a tremendous throw to keep Seattle alive. Then, a two-point conversion to win the game.\n\nSeattle moved to first place in the NFC West and the NFC. If they win out, they will be the No. 1 seed in the NFL.\n\nThe 49ers also control their own destiny. If San Francisco wins their next three games, they are the No. 1 seed. Thursday night went about as well as you could have hoped results-wise for the 49ers. Both teams showed cracks on both sides of the ball, and how they could potentially be vulnerable down the stretch. Best of all, the Seahawks won, opening the door to win the top seed and earn a coveted bye.\n\nAny other loss by the 49ers would require the Rams to lose again if they want to be the No. 1 seed.\n\nThe biggest deal about the Rams losing isn’t just the 49ers’ odds jumping to 23 percent to get the No. 1 seed; it’s their playoff odds shooting up to 99 percent. There’s a way for the 49ers to lose all three games and still make the playoffs. The Lions winning out is one of the few ways the 49ers would miss the postseason if they lose every game.\n\nSeattle Seahawks 12-3 (clinched playoff spot)\n\nLos Angeles Rams 11-5 (clinched a playoff spot)",

In the portal-heavy world of college football, everything is under a microscope according to McElroy.\n\n“The quarterback market is going to be a bit of a wild one this time of year,” McElroy said. “I think because of how high-profile some of these players are and how high-profile some of those schools are that are going to be in pursuit of some of these players, it makes sense that this could be one of the wilder quarterback carousels that we’ve seen in recent years.”\n\nGet used to the portal being used constantly to find quarterbacks, rather than high school prospects.\n\nTherefore, a program like the Ducks potentially wanting Raiola shouldn't come as a surprise.\n\n\"Scouting high school kids is great, but when it comes to the quarterback spot, you cannot win without them,” McElroy said. \"“So, it makes a lot of sense that there are a handful of teams that are now opting to go with the one-year or two-year rental transfer when compared to going with a guy that is homegrown from the get-go.\"\n\nIt's unclear where Raiola may end up, but heads may begin to roll if the Ducks end up winning the sweepstakes.",

    "fullText": "The field of 64 teams in the 2025 NCAA volleyball tournament is down to the championship with the No. 1 Kentucky Wildcats and No. 3 seed Texas A&M Aggies remaining. They will face off in the first all-SEC national championship game on Sunday, Dec. 21 (3:30 p.m. ET, ABC) at the T-Mobile Center in Kansas City.\n\nTexas A&M is looking to take its best season in program history even further. The Aggies are vying for their first title in their first championship appearance after upsetting No. 1 overall seed Nebraska and No. 1 Pitt in the Elite Eight and Final Four, respectively. Meanwhile, Kentucky is looking to win its second title and first since 2020 after getting past No. 3 Wisconsin in a thrilling five-set semifinal win.\n\nHere's a preview of the national championship, including lineups and X-factors to keep an eye on:\n\nNo. 3 Texas A&M will face off against No. 1 Kentucky in the national championship game on on Sunday, Dec. 21 (3:30 p.m. ET, ABC) at T-Mobile Center in Kansas City.\n\n6 Kassie O'Brien | S 6-1 - Freshman\n\n10 Kennedy Washington | MB 6-0 - Sophomore\n\n11 Molly Berezowitz | DS 5-5 - Junior\n\n12 Molly Tuozzo | L 5-7 - Junior\n\n15 Lizzie Carr | MB 6-6 - Redshirt Junior\n\n17 Brooklyn DeLeye | OH 6-2 - Junior\n\nIt's unusual to list an AVCA First-team All-American as an X-factor, but Brooklyn Deleye's performance will be paramount against the streaking Aggies. Kentucky got off to a slow start in the first set of their Final Four win over No. 3 Wisconsin — suffering their worst deficit in a set since 2018 — due in part to Deleye's early struggles. She hit 15 kills on 50 total attempts, but her dismal .160 hitting percentage marked her third-lowest of the season. The Wildcats and Deleye must come out strong in the national championship and cannot afford to get behind the Aggies.\n\n37 Kyndal Stowers | OH 5-11 - Sophomore\n\n1 Ifenna Cos-Okpalla | MB 6-2 - Senior\n\n2 Addi Applegate | L/DS 5-5 - Freshman\n\n9 Logan Lednicky | OPP 6-3 - Senior\n\n12 Ava Underwood | L/DS 5-7 - Senior\n\n16 Maddie Waak | S 5-10 - Senior\n\nIfenna Cos-Okpalla is a 2025 AVCA First-Team All-American for a reason.

    "description": "It wasn’t pretty, but the New York Rangers came away with a 2-1 win over the St. Louis Blues on Thursday night.",
    "fullText": "It wasn’t pretty, but the New York Rangers came away with a 2-1 win over the St. Louis Blues on Thursday night.\n\nGoing into this matchup, the Rangers had lost two consecutive games while only scoring one goal in the process.\n\nMike Sullivan’s response was to call up Gabe Perreault and Brennan Othmann from the Hartford Wolf Pack of the American Hockey League, who both slotted into the lineup.\n\nDespite a strong first period where the Rangers led 10-5 in shots and dominated possession time for the most part, an offensive zone turnover led to a goal from Jonatan Berggren, putting the Blueshirts in an early 1-0 hole.\n\nThe Rangers came out aggressive in the second period, and on the power play, Will Cuylle took a shot that deflected off of Perreault’s foot for his first career NHL goal.\n\n“I kind of blacked out,” Perreault said about his goal. “Pretty lucky one, but feels good to get the first one.”\n\nAfter 40 minutes, the Rangers held a 25-15 edge in shots and felt they were outplaying the Blues.\n\n“I thought for the first two periods, we did a really good job,” Sullivan said. “I thought we were playing on top of them. We established a lot of offensive zone time.”\n\nThe Rangers’ game began to falter in the third period.\n\nSt. Louis began dictating the pace of play, creating multiple high-quality scoring chances, which put the Rangers on their heels for the majority of the final frame.\n\nIt was the heroics of Igor Shesterkin that helped the Rangers escape into overtime. Shesterkin made 11 critical saves down the stretch, and when the Blueshirts broke down defensively, their superstar goalie was there to bail them out.\n\n“It’s great,” J.T. Miller said of having Igor Shesterkin in net. “We talk about it all the time, it’s such a luxury to have. Even when it’s Quick in there, we are so lucky to have those guys, and obviously total confidence in them. It was on display again tonight.”\n\nShesterkin made 26 saves on the night, and his performance left Blues head coach Jim Montgomery nothing but impressed.\n\n\"Shesterkin's an elite goaltender in this league,” Montgomery said. “He showed that tonight.”\n\nIn overtime, Miller buried the game-winning goal to propel the Rangers to a hard-fought victory.\n\nMiller has recorded three overtime goals this season, joining Tomas Sandstrom, Adam Graves, and Marian Gaborik as the only Rangers players to accomplish this feat.\n\n“It's good for the confidence,” Miller said of his three overtime goals. “Last couple weeks, I feel like my games there. I don't think it's kind of back to the same as the beginning of the year. It's like not getting as much as I'd like, I think, on the scoresheet. But I got to believe that if you just play like that most games than not over the course of the season, good things will happen. Just try to be confident.”\n\nAdam Fox Returns To Practice For The First Time Since Suffering Injury It appears as if Adam Fox is making strides in his recovery from an upper-body injury.&nbsp;\n\nWhile this performance certainly wasn’t anything to write home about, Sullivan was pleased with the way his team played, specifically from the standpoint of playing with the right intentions in the offensive zone.\n\n“I thought our intentions as far as getting to the net front, getting inside a little bit more was better tonight,” Sullivan emphasized. “I thought we had more looks just by getting inside and trying to create off the shot. I do think the guys are listening in that regard, just trying to create more off the shot.”\n\nThe Rangers will be back in action on Saturday afternoon against the Philadelphia Flyers.",

From there, with a little luck and help from his receivers, Darnold brought the Seahawks back to not only win the game, but clinch a playoff spot and take control of the NFC's No. 1 seed.\n\nDarnold's career has been full of rough moments, so it must've felt good for him to produce a high-level comeback on national television in such a big game.

Londynn Jones had herself a career night against the Mustangs in front of the 3,511 spectators at the Galen Center, dropping 28 points on 11-16 shooting and 4 steals.\n\nComing into Thursday night, the Trojans were coming off the trail of an ugly loss at home last Saturday to the best team in the country, the UConn Huskies, and with a great week of practice following the loss, according to USC Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb, she was encouraged by how the Women of Troy would respond to Cal Poly.\n\n\"I just wanted to use my time to be as clear with film and messaging as I could to lead us in the right direction,\" Gottlieb said on how she utilized the days off after the UConn loss to hone in on the mistakes that were easily noticeable during film sessions, even prefacing to her team and staff that the UConn film session would not be a \"pretty\" session.\n\nDespite the poor film session, Gottlieb expressed her enthusiasm for the encouraging aspects the film provided, as the team quickly identified their mistakes and was able to work on them easily in preparation for their Thursday matchup.\n\n\"While we got it handed to us, we also saw things that we could've done better immediately, saw things we could improve at, and what we wanted to see was a team that was more intentional defensively,\" Gottlieb said on the upside of their latest film session.\n\nThe Women of Troy must have received the memo, as they came out of the gates hot in the first half, and they went on two individual scoring runs that separated them from the Mustangs. An early 12-0 run in the middle of the first quarter and a 7-0 run heading into the locker room for halftime had the Trojans up 45-23.\n\nJones was torching it up offensively, leading the team with 18 first-half points on 7-9 shooting, including 3-5 from beyond the arc. Jazzy Davidson led right behind her with 7 points, but was being more frugal on the offensive side and was more active on the defensive end, snagging 6 rebounds in 18 minutes.\n\nThe second half was no different and was kicked into second gear as Jones and Davidson had 10 points each, and the entire team locked up any chances for Cal Poly to start any offense. At one point in the game, the Women of Troy had themselves a 50-point lead in the final minutes of the 4th quarter and had a 19-0 run in the second half as well.\n\n\"I'm just happy that we're starting to figure out how to put the pieces together, and it's been something that we've been emphasizing during practice,\" Jones said after USC's win and reflection on her 28-point night.\n\nWith this win, the Women of Troy improve to 8-3 on the season and have one more game up north against the California Golden Bears before taking eight days off to play Nebraska on December 29.",

    "fullText": "The Athletic journalist David Ornstein has named the candidate who “is going to be a Chelsea manager” amidst Enzo Maresca doubts.\n\nThis week has seen a whole lot of drama bubble up at Stamford Bridge surrounding head coach Maresca.\n\nThere was some breaking news yesterday, actually from Ornstein as well, suggesting that Manchester City were eyeing Maresca as a top candidate to replace Pep Guardiola, who looks like he could depart the club in the summer.\n\nMaresca actually did his best Pep Guardiola impression after Chelsea’s win over Cardiff in midweek, claiming he was “very happy” while looking anything but. It was as unsettling as you could imagine…\n\nThings are certainly not right there, and we can all clearly see that there is a lot of tension between the Chelsea manager and the board room right now.\n\nHow will it end? Well, personally I can only see Maresca leaving Chelsea in the summer, or being sacked. Likely some sort of mutual agreement will happen.\n\nLiam Rosenior managing Strasbourg. (Photo by George Wood/Getty Images)\n\nOrnstein, speaking on The Athletic Podcast yesterday with words from it cited on X, said:\n\n“There are many people who already saying Liam Rosenior at Strasbourg is going to be a Chelsea manager in the future, whether it’s in the immediate or medium or longer term. And that shows their contingency plans, like all well organized top clubs will be in place in one way, shape or form.”\n\nYou read stories and situations and this is just one of them that feels like it will happen, like it is inevitable.\n\nRosenior to replace Maresca at Chelsea this summer? I’d certainly not be putting any money against that happening.",

    "description": "Arkansas State completes mission of winning season and unlocks a new achievement in Frisco, TX.",
    "fullText": "Arkansas State unlocked a significant achievement Thursday night in Frisco, TX.\n\nThe Red Wolves emerged victorious in the inaugural Xbox Bowl, taking down first-year FBS program Missouri State 34-28 in the first college football game played at the Ford Center inside The Star — the practice facility of the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nImmediately after Master Chief from Halo handled the coin toss, Arkansas State wasted no time in completing a successful mission, pouncing on its competition to manufacture a lead as great as 31-7. Missouri State stared down the red ring of death but didn’t disconnect its controller. The Bears’ instead fought to the finish but failed to recover a late onside kick, watching a successful inaugural season conclude in heartbreaking fashion.\n\nArkansas State relied on the arm of veteran quarterback Jaylen Raynor, whose passing attributes looked maxed out at 99 overall for much of Thursday night. The junior finished 17-of-31 with 288 yards, delivering three touchdowns to three different targets. On the Red Wolves’ opening series, he delivered a strike to a 7-yard touchdown Jaylen Bonelli. He continued his rampage with a 71-yard sideline deep shot to sixth-year senior receiver Corey Rucker — a longtime Arkansas State standout playing his final collegiate game. Then to manufacture a 24-7 halftime lead, the quarterback played pitch and catch with Chauncy Cobb, who caught a 4-yard touchdown set up by one of Raynor’s several successful deep balls.\n\nRucker, who exceeded 100 yards in Arkansas State’s 2024 bowl victory, concluded his college career on a spectacular note. He posted 166 yards and a touchdown on six catches, exceeding 160 for the fifth time in Red Wolves colors. Rucker already held designation as the program’s career leader in receiving yards, but on his lone touchdown, he moved into sole possession of first place on Arkansas State’s all-time receiving touchdowns list, breaking a tie with Omar Bayless.\n\nMissouri State’s seventh-year quarterback Jacob Clark also saw a noble sendoff despite a losing effort, firing for 349 yards and four touchdowns against the Sun Belt opponent. However, the quarterback — who had been sacked more than any other QB in the FBS this year — was upended in the backfield all game long by an Arkansas State defense which generated nine sacks. Missouri State’s offensive line looked like it accidentally set the difficulty to Heisman mode, as Arkansas State defensive linemen Ethan Hassler, Demarcus Hendricks, and Cody Silger all frequented the hit stick to register multiple sacks in a pure domination.\n\nWith that immense pressure, Missouri State’s offense severely lagged, punting on seven of its first eight possessions. Because its lone touchdown over that 8-drive span was a 39-yard completion to Dash Luke, the Bears never snapped the ball inside the Arkansas State 35-yard line until roughly one minute remained in the third quarter. With Luke thriving in the second half behind a 7-reception, 169-yard, 2-touchdown performance, Missouri State’s offense surged late, but the Bears were in too deep of a hole with too time to fully climb out.\n\nMissouri State (7-6, 5-3 CUSA) still finished its first FBS season above .500 — a remarkable accomplishment for the program. Now that the Bears checked off their first box of playing in a bowl game, in 2026 they’ll look to move one step further by managing a bowl victory. Leading the charge will be SMU offensive coordinator Casey Woods, who is slated to accept the Missouri State head coaching position later in the week, as the team transitions to year two.\n\nArkansas State (7-6, 5-3 Sun Belt) wins its second-straight bowl game under head coach Butch Jones. The Red Wolves never won a single bowl until 2012, but now six bowl trophies will reside in their facilities when they return to Jonesboro. With the win, Arkansas State clinched back-to-back winning campaigns for the first time since its fruitful 2011-19 stretch, concluding the 2025 season with a new achievement in the inaugural Xbox Bowl.",

    "description": "Keira Barry has made a huge impact at Sunderland since joining from Manchester United. Charlotte Patterson explains why!",
    "fullText": "When Sunderland AFC Women announced the loan signing of Manchester United forward Keira Barry ahead of the 2025/2026 campaign, the move was framed as a mutually beneficial opportunity: a talented young attacker seeking consistent senior minutes and a fiercely ambitious club eager to sharpen its cutting edge in the final third.\n\nBarry arrived on Wearside with a growing reputation, a hunger for responsibility, and a résumé that already included Manchester United academy pedigree, England youth caps, and a successful loan spell at Crystal Palace during their 2024 Barclays Women’s Championship title‑winning season.\n\nWhat follows is a period that not only validated Sunderland’s faith in her but also accelerated Barry’s evolution into one of the most dynamic young forwards in the domestic game.\n\nHer early interviews revealed a player who immediately felt at home; Barry spoke openly about how quickly she connected with the environment, praising the inclusivity and ambition of the club and describing Sunderland as “one big team” with a culture that matched her own work ethic and aspirations.\n\nThat sense of belonging translated directly into her performances. From her first appearances, she played with the confidence of someone who understood both the opportunity and the responsibility placed upon her shoulders.\n\nBarry’s impact became visible not only in her goals but in the way she reshaped Sunderland’s attacking identity.\n\nHer first major headline moment arguably came in the high‑profile derby against Newcastle United Women at St James’ Park, where she scored Sunderland’s only goal in a 3–1 defeat — a strike that showcased her instinctive movement and composure under pressure. Though the result didn’t fall Sunderland’s way, Barry’s performance stood out during a difficult afternoon, reinforcing her growing importance to the side.\n\nHowever, many could argue that their first real taste of what Barry could offer was when she came off the bench against Birmingham as the entire tempo of Sunderland’s attack shifted. She immediately injected urgency and imagination, and her most audacious moment arrived when she spotted the goalkeeper off her line and attempted an outrageous lob from close to the halfway line.\n\nIt was the kind of instinctive, high‑skill effort that only a player brimming with confidence and flair even considers, let alone executes cleanly.\n\nFor a split second, the stadium held its breath as the ball arced through the air — a reminder that Barry possesses not just technical quality but the boldness to try something spectacular when others might play it safe. It was nearly a match‑winning moment and an example of her fearless mentality.\n\nWhat made Barry’s season so far so compelling wasn’t simply the goals she scored but the completeness of her attacking profile.\n\nShe arrived as a forward with raw pace, sharp instincts, and a reputation for directness, but has developed into a far more nuanced and influential presence. Her style of play blended technical precision with relentless energy, makes her a constant threat whether she was leading the line, drifting wide, or dropping between the lines to link play.\n\nBarry’s main attacking strengths are her ability to manipulate defenders with a combination of close control and explosive acceleration.\n\nHer dribbling ability has become one of Sunderland’s most reliable weapons. She has a knack for carrying the ball at speed without losing balance or awareness, often gliding past opponents with a single touch or a subtle change of direction. This isn’t showmanship for its own sake — it’s purposeful, vertical, and always aimed at destabilising defensive structures. Additionally, Barry’s dribbling is the kind that forces opponents to retreat, reshaping the pitch in Sunderland’s favour and creating space for teammates to exploit.\n\nHer pace is also a defining feature of her game.\n\nBarry possesses not only straight‑line speed but also the ability to accelerate sharply in tight spaces. This makes her particularly dangerous in transitional moments, where Sunderland’s counterattacking sequences often begin with a simple ball into her path.\n\nOnce in stride, few defenders can match her and her tenacity amplifies this threat. She chases down loose balls, presses aggressively from the front, and refuses to let defenders settle. Even when she doesn’t win possession directly, her pressure frequently forces hurried clearances or turnovers that Sunderland can capitalise on.\n\nHowever, Barry’s game isn’t built solely on physical attributes. One of the most impressive aspects of her development is her reading of the game.\n\nShe demonstrates an increasingly sophisticated understanding of timing — when to drop deep, when to spin in behind, when to hold her run, and when to attack the near post. Her movement is often a study in anticipation and she reads defensive lines with the intuition of a seasoned striker, often arriving in pockets of space a fraction of a second before her marker.\n\nThis intelligence makes her a consistent outlet for Sunderland’s midfielders and full backs, who’ve quickly learned to trust her runs.\n\nHer reading of the game also extends to her link‑up play, and her ability to combine with teammates improved markedly as the season progressed.\n\nShe’a developed a strong rapport with Sunderland’s wide players — particularly Katie Kitching in the ten — frequently exchanging quick passes to break pressure or create overloads. Her first touch, already a strength, has become even more reliable under pressure, allowing her to receive the ball in tight areas and either turn sharply or lay it off with precision. This makes her not only a finisher but also a facilitator, someone who can knit together attacking sequences and elevate the players around her.\n\nHer crossing has become one of the most distinctive and dangerous elements of her game, the kind of delivery that can tilt the rhythm of a match in Sunderland’s favour almost instantly.\n\nBarry has a natural feel for shaping the ball into areas defenders hate — teasing, dipping crosses that force centre backs to turn, hesitate, or overcommit. Whether she drives to the byline or cuts inside onto her stronger foot, she delivers with a blend of precision and imagination, often picking out runners with a level of consistency that makes her a trusted outlet in wide areas. Her ability to cross at full speed without breaking stride adds an extra layer of unpredictability, turning even half‑chances into genuine opportunities and giving Sunderland a reliable source of creativity whenever the game becomes tight.\n\nHer shot, meanwhile, carries a wickedness that sets her apart from many forwards of her age. Barry strikes the ball with a venomous combination of technique and intent, generating power that belies her frame and accuracy that punishes even the smallest defensive lapse.\n\nShe can whip a shot across goal with minimal backlift, catch keepers off-guard with early strikes, or unleash rising efforts from the edge of the box that demand spectacular saves. What’s made her shooting truly dangerous is her confidence: she never hesitates to pull the trigger when space opens, and her ability to generate both pace and swerve means that even well‑positioned goalkeepers find her efforts difficult to read.\n\nIt’s the kind of finishing that doesn’t just score goals — it changes the momentum of matches.\n\nConsistency has become one of Barry’s defining traits and even during matches where Sunderland havestruggled collectively, the level of her individual performances rarely dipped.\n\nShe brings the same intensity, intelligence, and technical quality week after week, and has established herself as one of the most dependable figures in the squad. Her work rate has never wavered and her willingness to track back, press, and contribute defensively makes her invaluable in a league where the margins are often razor‑thin.\n\nStatistically, Barry’s contributions are significant.\n\nShe’s scored in key fixtures — including a derby goal against Newcastle United Women — and her involvement in Sunderland’s attacking phases extends far beyond goals alone. Her chance creation numbers have risen steadily, reflecting her growing influence as both a scorer and provider.\n\nAlthough Sunderland’s overall results have fluctuated, Barry’s individual metrics such as progressive carries, successful dribbles, shots on target, and pressing actions consistently rank among the highest in the squad. These statistics underscore what is evident to anyone watching: she’s becoming a complete forward.\n\nHer background has provided context for this rapid progression.\n\nBarry had already experienced senior football with Manchester United, making her debut in December 2022 in a League Cup match against Sheffield United. She has also represented England at U19 level, scoring once in five appearances.\n\nHer loan spell at Crystal Palace during their 2024 title‑winning campaign gave her a taste of high‑stakes football and the demands of a promotion push, and by the time she arrived at Sunderland, she was no longer a prospect but a player ready to take on a central role.\n\nSunderland’s environment proves ideal for her next stage of growth and the club’s ambition, culture, and emphasis on hard work aligns perfectly with her mentality.\n\nBarry herself highlighted this fit, noting that Sunderland “always puts the graft in” — a quality she values deeply. This synergy between player and club created the conditions for her breakout season and as the 2025/2026 campaign continues, Barry’s influence extends beyond the pitch.\n\nHer professionalism, attitude, and commitment have made her a respected figure within the squad. Younger players look up to her despite being young herself, whilst her senior teammates appreciate her reliability and drive. She embodies the blend of talent and work ethic that Sunderland has sought to cultivate.\n\nBarry’s season so far will be remembered as a pivotal chapter in her career; a period of accelerated growth, consistent excellence, and undeniable impact.\n\nShe arrived as a talented young forward seeking opportunities and will leave in January (or hopefully not, if we can extend her loan deal) as one of the most exciting attacking players in the league. Her dribbling ability, pace, tenacity, reading of the game, and attacking instincts combined to create a player capable of changing matches on her own. Her performances have not only been consistently good but often decisive, elevating Sunderland’s attacking threat and giving the supporters a glimpse of a star in the making.\n\nIn the broader landscape of women’s football, Barry’s half-season with the club stands as a testament to the value of strategic loans, supportive environments, and the importance of giving young players meaningful responsibility.\n\nSunderland has provided a platform and Barry provided the brilliance. Together, they created a story of growth, ambition, and success that’ll be remembered long after the final whistle of the season — despite the mixed performances from the club as a whole.\n\nIf her trajectory continues on its current path, the 2025/2026 campaign will be seen not as the peak but as the beginning — a season that unlocked her potential and set the stage for an exceptional career at the highest level.\n\nI only hope we can extend her loan to the end of the season and maybe — just maybe, dear reader — we can pull off a miracle and acquire her services permanently.",

    "description": "“If we want to attract young, ambitious and talented players, this is the tradeoff we need to accept”",
    "fullText": "It’s a mark of the huge impact they’ve made and their popularity with the fans that Sunday’s Wear-Tyne derby felt a tad bittersweet as we were treated to the sight of Sunderland’s AFCON-eligible players turning in yet another exceptionally gutsy performance before they bade a temporary farewell to Wearside in order to represent their countries in Morocco.\n\nBeating Newcastle United at home in front of a packed house before jetting off in the hope of winning silverware at Africa’s biggest footballing jamboree? Not the worst note on which to temporarily sign off!\n\nOf course, when we added these lads to the ranks in the summer, we did so in the hope that we’d possibly signed some previously undiscovered or overlooked gems — but in the knowledge that we’d have to deal with plenty of international absences during the 2025/2026 season.\n\nThat was the balance we had to strike — not least to ensure we brought players to Wearside who could build on what we achieved in 2024/2025 and to give ourselves the best possible chance of being competitive in the Premier League. Running the risk of paying the dreaded “English tax”? No thanks. We widened the scope of our search for talent, tapped into new markets and came up trumps.\n\nHowever, for Reinildo, Noah Sadiki, Chemsdine Talbi, Arthur Masuaku, Bertrand Traoré and club record signing Habib Diarra — somewhat controversially called up by Senegal after a lengthy injury layoff — signing off with a victory over Newcastle could hardly have been a more fitting note.\n\nWill we miss them? Of course — even though we’ve got along just fine in the absence of midfield powerhouse Diarra — but I can’t deny the sense of pride I feel at having so many Sunderland players considered among the best their countries have to offer, and it’ll be a real boon for the club as they compete for victory at AFCON.\n\nIf we want to attract young, ambitious and talented players, this is the tradeoff we need to accept.\n\nEvery one of these lads has contributed significantly in their own way — a ringing endorsement of the standard of Sunderland’s summer recruitment and the way in which they’ve acquitted themselves since signing. They’ve evidently won the trust of Régis Le Bris through their application, ability and sheer will to win, and they’re clearly fully invested in what’s taking shape at Sunderland.\n\nOnly Masuaku hasn’t really made a huge impact, yet former Atlético Madrid left back Reinildo is making a strong case for being one of the Stadium of Light era’s shrewdest free transfers.\n\nTalbi is an immensely exciting talent; Traoré is a wily and industrious winger and Sadiki and Diarra — along with Granit Xhaka — formed what was a hugely promising midfield trio before Diarra was struck by injury, so it’s natural that we’ll be poorer for their absence and required to adapt.\n\nHowever, despite this mass exodus of talent, there’ll be no panic from Le Bris or the coaching staff.\n\nWe’ve known for some time that AFCON absences would represent one of our major challenges and we certainly won’t be heading into this period unprepared and unsure as to what to do. With the January transfer window not far off, two avenues will converge: that of phasing new recruits into the side and eventually welcoming back the lads from Morocco, which will hopefully enable us to mount a strong push during the latter half of the season.\n\nIn practical terms, this may mean that the likes of Chris Rigg, Dennis Cirkin, Romaine Mundle, Dan Neil and 2024 AFCON winner Simon Adingra — overlooked by the Cote D’Ivoire for this tournament yet a hugely talented player nonetheless — find themselves back in the fold during the coming weeks, with all kinds of speculation about potential system changes and the like.\n\nI do believe that even in the absence of the players mentioned, we have enough strength in depth to cope.\n\nIt may mean the possibility of one or two unorthodox positional changes for the players who remain — Lutsharel Geertruida is someone I’m particularly eager to see more of — as well as a change of shape for the team as a whole, but so strong is our team spirit and the collective desire to win, there’ll be no question of their willingness to slot in where needed. That’s a basic requirement and would be for any player attempting to make a push for a first team berth.\n\nThis season, we’ve seen Trai Hume and Dan Ballard striding through games for Northern Ireland. Robin Roefs is very firmly in the mix with the Netherlands, and we’ve also seen Omar Alderete dishing out his own brand of vigilante justice when Paraguay took on the United States. Now it’s time for our “Super Six” to take centre stage and with any luck, they’ll be blessed and reign down in Africa.\n\nGood luck, boys. Go well, represent your countries with pride, passion and commitment, and we’ll be ready to welcome you back once it’s over — hopefully for what’ll be a memorable second half of the 2025/2026 season!",

    "fullText": "With the celebrations of the derby win still keeping us warm and fulfilled as the dismal weather continues and the shortest day of the year draws near, the name of Granit Xhaka is still dominating discussions. Finally, some of the “expert” pundits have begun to recognise what we Sunderland fans have known for several months – our captain is the Premier League signing of the season.\n\nHe has set standards, demonstrated leadership, provided experience, and driven performances, all while covering more ground than any other player in the league – despite the fact that his legs are apparently gone!\n\nNaturally, the well-deserved plaudits he has received have kept the focus on the Swiss international as Sunderland have defied the expectations of a modern newly promoted Premier League side.\n\nBut the summer recruitment drive has provided a plethora of players who have all contributed massively to the results that have been achieved thus far. Robin Roefs, Nordi Mukiele, Omar Alderete, Noah Sadiki, Chemsdine Talbi, and Brian Brobbey have all played significant roles in the performances to date but, for me, there is one player who stands out as “the second-best signing of the season”.\n\nAs much as much of the fanbase are still marvelling at the fact that KLD managed to convince Granit Xhaka to join a newly promoted side, I am still astonished that Reinildo Mandava is wearing the red and white of Sunderland after more than three distinguished years wearing the red and white of Atlético Madrid under the demanding Diego Simeone.\n\nHis pedigree as a Champions League regular has been obvious, and he has brought much-needed experience to a position which had the potential to be a problem for Régis Le Bris. Dennis Cirkin clearly has the ability to make the grade at this level, as does Aji Alese, but both have injury records that are concerning.\n\nInstead, we have been treated to the sight of Reinildo demonstrating his electrifying pace, whether shutting down his side of the defence or rampaging down the wing in support of the likes of Le Fée and Talbi. Yes, he blotted his copybook with a foolish reaction to being fouled by Aston Villa’s Matty Cash, but he has come back impeccably. On Sunday, Anthony Elanga might as well have gone to the pub and played the one-armed bandit – he would have got more change out of that than he did out of Reinildo!\n\nReinildo’s partnership with Omar Alderete has secured the left-hand side of Sunderland’s defence and given the Paraguayan confidence to step forward when the opportunity arises and display his willingness to both carry the ball forward and to showcase his impressive passing technique. Reinildo provides overlaps and underlaps that create space for Chemsdine Talbi to exploit. On Sunday it was noticeable that Sadiki was pushing forward, finding more advanced positions on the left wing, carrying the ball, and getting to the byline.\n\nAnd, just as Xhaka has, the Mozambique international has bought into the infectious enthusiasm that exists in Sunderland v.2025 – he channelled his inner Muhammad Ali as he bobbed and weaved with the Sky camera on the pitch after the final whistle.\n\nNoah Sadiki will be a bigger miss during AFCON – but only because there is no obvious replacement in the squad for the energy and work-rate that he offers. There are more defensive options to cover Reinildo’s absence, but none of them will bring to the table the complete suite of left-back skills that he has.\n\nWhen I was writing this, it was a toss-up between Reinildo and Mukiele. The deciding factor for me was the influence that Reinildo has on the performances of other players – his presence and athleticism gives Alderete, Talbi, Sadiki, and Le Fée licence to forage forward and showcase their talents, secure in the knowledge that Reinildo has the pace to cover any counter-attack down that flank.\n\nGranit Xhaka is undoubtedly the signing of the season. For me, Reinildo sits comfortably in second place behind him.",

    "fullText": "It seems certain that Claudio Echeverri will return to Manchester City in January. His loan move to Bayer Leverkusen hasn’t panned out as Echeverri has only made eleven appearances for Leverkusen this season. The majority of those appearances have been as a late substitute. Such appearances have done nothing to aid the development of the young attacking midfielder. It has now been reported that Echeverri is open to terminating his loan with Bayer Leverkusen with the hope of joining Vitor Reis at Girona for the second half of this season. That was the move Echeverri should have made at the beginning of this season to aid his development.\n\nJournalist Nil Sola has reported via X that Claudio Echeverri has already said yes to having his loan spell at Bayer Leverkusen terminated in January. Furthermore, Solar reports that Girona are eager to sign Echeverri on loan for the second half of this season. It is also reported by Sola that Claudio Echeverri’s agent pushed for the young attacking midfielder to join Bayer Leverkusen over Girona last summer. Clearly, that move hasn’t panned out for Echeverri based on his lack of minutes and first-team opportunities at the Bundesliga club.\n\nLooking back, Claudio Echeverri should have joined Girona for the 25/26 season. He would have had opportunities to play in La Liga at Girona. Vitor Reis has come on in leaps and bounds this season playing regularly in La Liga. Yes, Girona has struggled this season. But Vitor Reis has risen to become one of the best young centre-backs in La Liga. If Echeverri followed a similar path to Reis, he could’ve played a prominent role for Girona. Instead, Echeverri’s agent pushed him to join Bayer Leverkusen. The idea was sound. Playing regularly in the Bundesliga and the Champions League would have benefited Echeverri. But that hasn’t occurred. Echeverri has spent the majority of his time on the bench at Leverkusen. That hasn’t aided his development at all. The first half of the 25/26 season seems to have been a waste for Echeverri.\n\nIf Echeverri does join Girona for the second half of the season the hope is that he can turn his season around. He should get first-team opportunities at Girona. It will be up to Echeverri to take them. Girona is a club that will play him and if all goes well, Echeverri could help them in their battle to avoid relegation this season. That would benefit Echeverri’s development greatly and that is exactly what Manchester City will be hoping for.\n\nUnfortunately, the first half of this season has been a harsh lesson for Claudio Echeverri. He hasn’t played for Bayer Leverkusen and his loan move to the Bundesliga side has cost him in terms of playing regularly to aid his development. A loan move to Girona could beckon and that is the move Echeverri should have made at the beginning of this season.",

    "fullText": "The Dallas Stars never trailed and found some wacky ways in a 5-3 win against the San Jose Sharks at SAP Center on Thursday.\n\nWyatt Johnston and Mikko Rantanen have found some chemistry on the top line this season. Despite not having a consistent linemate on their left, the duo sits first and third in team scoring. Put them on the power play together, and look out, other 31 teams.\n\nEntering tonight, Johnston led the NHL with 12 power-play goals. Despite not scoring them quite as rapidly as he was early on, he was still three goals ahead of No. 2 on that list, Alex DeBrincat. Rantanen ranked third behind only Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl in power-play points.\n\nWell, add another goal for Johnston and another point for Rantanen with the extra man tonight. And was it ever pretty?\n\nTee'd up beautifully 🔥 pic.twitter.com/VpYaOg2b4a\n\n— Dallas Stars (@DallasStars) December 19, 2025\n\nThe Stars power play remains near or at the top of the league, and they are scoring goals that often look like this. Knowing where each other are on the ice, making clean passes without hesitation or stickhandling, and finishing off their chances. Elite.\n\nOh, and I almost forgot to mention that Johnston had already scored in the game. And it was a 5-on-5 goal, which he has not done a lot of lately. According to our pal Craig Ludwig, Johnston needs to show he can produce consistently at even strength if he has any shot of making Team Canada at the Olympics.\n\nDoes this look like a player who can do that?\n\nWho says Wyatt can't score 5v5? pic.twitter.com/77t9PynPi5\n\n— DLLS Stars (@DLLS_Stars) December 19, 2025\n\nThe fake hip opener like he is backing down a smaller man in the paint to get the bucket… So nice. He sells former Stars defenseman John Klingberg on the roll move to his backside, quickly pushes off his right skate, and creates just enough space to wire this wrist shot over the glove. Nice.\n\nRantanen has two assists so far, primary assists, of course, and has jumped Olli Jokinen for the fifth-most points by a Finnish player in NHL history (751).\n\nOn the DLLS pregame show, we talked about how fun and adventurous Alex Nedeljkovic is with the puck. Sean Shapiro watched him a lot in Detroit and made it clear that he has elite puck skills, but will also make questionable decisions or passes every once in a while.\n\nThrough 30 minutes, Nedeljkovic had already diced up the Stars forecheck on multiple occasions, but also turned it over twice in his own end. High-event goaltending, and we are just talking about what he can do with the puck.\n\nSan Jose couldn’t create off his passes, and Dallas didn’t make him pay for his mistakes. But that changed in the final minute of the period when Nedeljkovic decided that Justin Hryckowian could really use a goal after not scoring for nearly a month.\n\nPut it on the Ritz! pic.twitter.com/wygAGplA2J\n\n— DLLS Stars (@DLLS_Stars) December 19, 2025\n\nWhile this play was funny and the Stars will happily take the two-goal lead into the third period, I really want to talk more about how much I love Hryckowian’s game.\n\nHe is just always going. He’s hard on the forecheck. He battles on the walls and in the corners. He works hard to gain positioning in front on both ends of the ice. He has skill to create when he has the puck and hockey IQ to find open space when he doesn’t. And best of all, he is an absolute pest who often gets under the skin of opponents and finds himself in the majority of post-whistle shenanigans. He makes people mad, and that is a skill in hockey. Trust me, I found a way to do it for years despite being small.\n\nHe can also fight, and has joined the ranks along with Jamie Benn, Lian Bichsel, and Mikko Rantanen for Stars skaters who will stand up for their teammates when needed.\n\nTonight, he showed a lot of that skill and grit, annoying Sharks and tallying his fourth goal of the season to wrap it all up.\n\nThe Sharks made this one interesting with Collin Graf’s third goal in two games against Dallas. I heard those ECAC kids are underrated, eh?\n\nBut when the Sharks made their third-period push, it was the Dallas penalty kill that had to once again come up big, as it has done since the first month of the season wrapped up. And they did exactly that.\n\nThe Stars PK simply does whatever it needs to do to kill a penalty. That means big saves from Jake Oettinger (or Casey DeSmith), which he does often. It means blocked shots. How about Oskar Bäck late in the final San Jose power play… Blocks it, one hand slaps it around the defender and goes off for a change.\n\nAnd sometimes, it means improvisation to keep the puck out of your net. We’ve seen diving saves, great sticks by Miro Heiskanen or Thomas Harley to keep the puck from crossing the line behind their goalie, and full-on saves from skaters when things get really wacky.\n\nBut, wacky times included, I don’t know if we’ve seen what Colin Blackwell did to get out of a tough position and kill a chunk of time late in the power play…\n\n*Colin Blackwell Heroic Moment Alert* pic.twitter.com/xLgtuI5XBN\n\n— Robert Tiffin (@RobertTiffin) December 19, 2025\n\nThis is incredible. Not only to block the shot and win a race to the puck after your stick goes flying into the neutral zone… But to stay poised enough to bend down and basically dribble the puck with his gloves… Remember, he is a great basketball player, folks.\n\nBlackwell turns his right hand over, pokes the puck to his right, then turns and chases it down before pushing it forward with his right glove again. Then, while fighting off a forechecker, he shields the puck, dives forward, and uses his left glove to slap it down the ice and get off for a change.\n\nDallas went 3-for-3 on the kill.\n\nSometimes, you just have to do what it takes. The weird Hryckowian goal, the killed power plays, and this Blackwell… Whatever it was, are good examples of that.\n\nJamie Benn added the empty-netter to put away another win for Dallas. A win, by the way, for Oettinger on his 27th birthday.\n\nIlya Lyubushkin looked very solid defensively tonight.\n\nNils Lundkvist made a few key plays, one being the backcheck and analysis of the rush late in the game on a 2-on-1.\n\nMacklin Celebrini is very good. Sometimes, he seems to be moving too fast either for his own good or for any of his teammates to keep up. He was constantly firing passes that Sharks could not handle or return. But watching him pick up pucks out of his skates and turn and burn with his head WAAAY up is a lot of fun.\n\nCasey DeSmith is expected to start Friday in Anaheim. DeSmith is riding an 11-game personal point streak (8-0-3).\n\nSharks fans doing the shark chomp and the arena playing “Jaws” music before power plays is pretty cool. Not quite as cool as the “fang fingers” in Nashville, though (100 percent sarcasm, that is so dumb.)\n\nDLLS After Dark brings out the worst (best) in all of us. Don’t forget to join the postgame show.",

    "description": "The Seattle Seahawks just won the game of the year!",
    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks have literally never played in a normal game ever, and Thursday Night Football was no exception. What advertised as the showdown of the season more than lived up to its top billing, as the Seahawks defeated the Los Angeles Rams 38-37 in overtime! Seattle rallied from a 30-14 deficit in the fourth quarter to prevail in one of the most thrilling games in franchise history.\n\nThe Seahawks now officially control their own destiny, not just for the NFC West, but to earn the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs. Imagine, the road to the Super Bowl could very well travel through the Emerald City for the fourth time ever.\n\nAs folks often say, \"it's not how you start, but how you finish.\" Well that summed up the Seahawks' night on Thursday, as the beginning hardly looked like this was going to result in a thrilling Seattle win. The Seahawks did open the game with a five-play, 61-yard touchdown drive - their first touchdown scored in the first quarter since the Week 10 win versus the Cardinals. This drive came after Seattle's defense forced a turnover on downs against the Rams' offense. An offense that had scored 41+ points in each of the last two games, mind you.\n\nLos Angeles did not stay silent for long, as they kicked field goals on their next consecutive drive. The Rams eventually took a 13-7 lead in the second quarter, which translated into halftime. Seattle's offense was finding it nearly impossible to stay on the field, as they were getting dominated in time of possession, losing that battle 21:13 to 8:47 after two quarters.\n\nThe Seahawks did win the coin toss at the start of the game and got the ball to begin the third quarter. Seattle took full advantage of this opportunity, which saw Kenneth Walker III erupt for a 55-yard touchdown to give the Hawks a 14-13 lead. That was the end of the good vibes in the third quarter for Seattle, as the Rams took full control of the game. Los Angeles retook the lead immediately with a field goal, and intercepted Sam Darnold on the ensuing Seahawks drive. The interception brough the ball to the 1-yard line, where LA scored immediately afterwards to go up 23-14.\n\nSeattle failed to respond, punted the ball, and the Rams delivered what many considered would be the dagger. Stafford drove his team 85 yards in nine plays and found embattled receiver Puka Nacua for a touchdown to build the lead to 30-14. At this point, it felt as if history was repeating itself, especially since recent TNF games at Seattle have resulted in blowout Seahawk losses.\n\nBut a spark was found... Los Angeles got the ball thanks to Darnold's second interception of the game deep in their own territory. Seattle's defense did force a punt from the Rams early in the fourth quarter, and wide receiver Rashid Shaheed turned the game around with a 58-yard punt return touchdown. After a successful 2-point conversion, it was suddenly a one-score 30-22 game with plenty of time left.\n\nRashid Shaheed got the Seahawks back into the game pic.twitter.com/6jjvjQ9UpS\n\n— The Seahawks Wire (@TheSeahawksWire) December 19, 2025\n\nFollowing the Rams' third-consecutive punt of the fourth quarter, the Seahawks only needed two plays to find the end zone once more. Rashid Shaheed's big game continued with a 31-yard rush. On the next play, Darnold found tight end AJ Barner for a wide open 26-yard touchdown reception. Suddenly, it was a 30-28 contest.\n\nThis is where things got bizarre. The Seahawks attempted a 2-point conversion. Darnold attempted a pass to Zach Charbonnet on a screen pass, but it was deflected and the attempt failed... or so we thought! Upon further review, Darnold had actually thrown the pass backwards, as in, a lateral. This meant Darnold's \"incompletion\" was actually a fumble, which was recovered in the end zone by a Seahawk who had touched it last. Instead of a Rams lead, the game was shockingly a 30-30 tie!\n\nThe north end zone at Lumen Field has bizarre and unexplainable properties. The site of the Fail Mary, Kam Chancellor’s fumble of Megatron, and now this. #Seahawks pic.twitter.com/IQdGpyZp8R\n\n— Kole Musgrove (@KoleMusgrove23) December 19, 2025\n\nLos Angeles unfortunately woke back up, and got the ball moving. Stafford maneuvered his offense within field goal range just before the two-minute warning. A quick side bar... in the press box, I was sitting next to Mazvita Maraire of Cascadiasports.net, and he quickly mentioned \"well, with the way this game is going, they'll probably miss the field goal.\"\n\nI should have asked him for lotto numbers next, as the Rams did miss a 48-yarder wide right.\n\nSeattle failed on not one, but two attempts to march down the field for a game-winner of their own. Now, it was overtime. The Seahawks did win the coin toss again, and decided to give the Rams the ball to start. In this new overtime system, both teams will get a chance to possess the ball regardless if the first team scores a touchdown to begin. Seattle wisely chose to go on offense second, as it meant they would be armed with all the knowledge of what they would need to do.\n\nTurns out they would need a touchdown of their own, as Stafford found Nacua for a 41-yard touchdown to go up 37-30. Nacua absolutely torched the Seattle secondary, hauling in 12 receptions for 225 yards and two scores.\n\nThis was it... do or die.... the Seahawks had one shot at redemption. One shot to earn revenge, punch their ticket for the postseason, and control their own destiny.\n\nDarnold, who had been battling both the Rams and the national narrative that he cannot show up in big games, was sublime when his team needed him most... once again. Darnold completed five passes for 53 yards, including a gorgeous strike to the former Ram himself, Cooper Kupp. Part one of redemption was found as Darnold found Jaxon Smith-Njigba for the touchdown.\n\nDecision time: do the Seahawks kick a field goal and play for a tie? After all, a tie would have been enough to clinch a playoff spot. Or do they go for the win? Well, fortune favored the bold! Darnold found tight end Eric Saubert for the biggest two-point conversion play of their careers as the Seahawks completed the comeback for a 38-37 victory!\n\nThe Seahawks are now 12-3, their first 12-win season since 2020 and only the fourth 12-win season in franchise history. Seattle controls their own destiny. If they win out, they will ensure the road to Super Bowl LX will travel down the Yellow Brick Road to the Emerald City. However, it is no small task. The Seahawks will now travel to Carolina to take on a shockingly competitive Panthers team. Keep in mind, the Panthers did upset the Rams not too long ago.\n\nA special season in Seattle continues next Sunday at 10:00 am Pacific Time.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Seahawks vs Rams: Seattle engineers comeback to defeat LA in overtime",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nPuka Nacua's wild week came to a head on Thursday night.\n\nEarlier this week, Nacua got into hot water for appearing on Adin Ross' live stream, in which he made an antisemitic gesture and criticized the referees.\n\n\"The refs are the worst,\" Nacua said. \"These guys are lawyers. They want to be on TV, too. . . . You don’t think he’s texting his friends in the group chat like, 'Yo, you guys just saw me on \"Sunday Night Football.\" Like, 'That wasn't P.I., like, but I called it.' . . . I mean, these guys are normal human beings, too.\"\n\nThen, on Thursday night, Nacua produced a career-best night as the Los Angeles Rams blew a 16-point lead to the Seattle Seahawks. The game, though, featured a controversial call by the referees that helped the Seahwaks tie the game.\n\nAfter the game, Nacua appeared to criticize the refs once again, which will put him once again in the league's crosshairs. Here's a breakdown of what Nacua did.\n\nMORE: How Sam Darnold led 16-point comeback\n\nAfter the Rams' loss to the Seahawks on Thursday night, Nacua instantly fired off a message on social media criticizing the referees.\n\n\"Can't say I was wrong,\" he said. \"Appreciate you stripes for your contributions. Lol.\"\n\nNacua referenced his comments on Adin Ross' stream earlier this week, when he said \"the refs are the worst.\" The wide receiver immediately deleted the message, but not before it went viral.\n\nThe tweet has since been deleted. https://t.co/52fSXsE8WSpic.twitter.com/8HH7TZoio6\n\n— Sarah Barshop (@sarahbarshop) December 19, 2025\n\nMORE: Updated NFC West standings after Seahawks beat Rams in OT\n\nMcVay got to the podium for his postgame press conference after Nacua sent and deleted his tweet, but the Rams head coach wasn't aware of Nacua's actions.\n\n\"I can't answer questions about something that I'm not aware of,\" he said.\n\nOn Nacua's controversial appearance on Adin Ross' live stream, McVay had a much more thorough answer and stood by his wide receiver while also acknowledging the wrong Nacua did.\n\n\"I don't think he understood the totality of some of the things,\" \"That's a great kid that's continuing to learn about the platform that he has. I love him, we're going to continue put our arm around him and help him learn and grow, but we never want to do things that offend anybody.\"\n\nSean McVay learned about Puka Nacua’s tweet during his postgame press conference and also responded to Nacua’s livestream with Adin Ross pic.twitter.com/6c9pS4ouNI\n\n— Ahmed/The Ears/IG: BigBizTheGod 🇸🇴 (@big_business_) December 19, 2025\n\nMcVay denied knowing anything about Nacua trying to get Ross to film on the Rams' facility, but he maintained that he will try to help the wide receiver mature as a person.",

    "fullText": "Researchers have homed in on a single gut microbe that acts to prevent fat gain, even with a high-fat diet. The discovery adds to the booming science of finding ways to enlist the microbes that already live in our bodies to help us improve our health.\n\nIt's been known for some time that our gut microbiome – the collection of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microscopic critters living in our intestines – can influence weight gain or loss. But narrowing down exactly which members of this microbial community do what can take some effort to tease out. That's because microbes that live inside the body don't do well outside of it, so to test them, they often have to be processed inside airtight environments, because oxygen can often kill them. This takes time.\n\nHowever, researchers at the University of Utah (U of U) say they have succeeded in whittling down about 100 bacteria suspected of fighting weight gain to just one that really does: Turicibacter.\n\nIn their study, mice that were fed a high-fat diet and were also given Turicibacter saw reduced blood sugar, lower levels of fat in the blood, and less overall weight gain compared to a control group.\n\n\"I didn’t think one microbe would have such a dramatic effect – I thought it would be a mix of three or four,\" says June Round, professor of microbiology and immunology at U of U Health, and senior author on the study. \"So when [Kendra Klag] brought me the first experiment with Turicibacter and the mice were staying really lean, I was like, 'This is so amazing.' It's pretty exciting when you see those types of results.\" Klag is the first author on the study.\n\nThe reason why the bacteria was successful in keeping fat-fed mice thin is due to a feedback loop based on fatty molecules called ceramides. These molecules increase on a high-fat diet and, as they accumulate, they not only cause the gut to increase its absorption of dietary fat, but they push the body toward higher storage of that fat. They also spike blood sugar levels, which leads to insulin resistance. This is why elevated ceramide levels have been linked to type 2 diabetes and heart disease. In some studies, in fact, they've been shown to be better predictors of cardiovascular disease than LDL cholesterol.\n\nSomewhat paradoxically, Turicibacter bacteria also produce lipids (fats) in the gut. But the molecules they produce actually tamp down the rise of ceramides, even in the face of high-fat consumption. Furthermore, when a high-fat diet is consumed, it drowns Turicibacter, eliminating its protective effects. In humans with obesity for example, Turicibacter levels in the gut have been found to be reduced.\n\nRegular supplementation in the study, however, kept the levels of Turicibacter-produced fats high and the mice slim and healthy. The researchers admit that it remains to be seen if the same results carry over to humans, but point to its potential in engineering new ways to combat weight gain.\n\n\"Identifying what lipid is having this effect is going to be one of the most important future directions, both from a scientific perspective because we want to understand how it works, and from a therapeutic standpoint,\" says Round. \"Perhaps we could use this bacterial lipid, which we know really doesn't have a lot of side effects because people have it in their guts, as a way to keep a healthy weight.\"\n\n\"With further investigation of individual microbes, we will be able to make microbes into medicine and find bacteria that are safe to create a consortium of different bugs that people with different diseases might be lacking,\" Klag adds.\n\nThe research has been published in the journal Cell Metabolism.",

    "description": "A long-standing physics mystery has been solved with the discovery of emergent photon-like behavior inside a strange quantum material. The finding confirms a true 3D quantum spin liquid and unlocks a new way to study deeply entangled matter.",
    "fullText": "A global research team led by Rice University physicist Pengcheng Dai has verified the presence of emergent photons and fractionalized spin excitations in an unusual quantum spin liquid. Reported in Nature Physics, the work points to the crystal cerium zirconium oxide (Ce2Zr2O7) as a clean three-dimensional example of this exotic state of matter.\n\nQuantum spin liquids have fascinated physicists for years because they could eventually support transformative technologies, including quantum computing and dissipationless energy transmission. Unlike ordinary magnets that settle into an orderly pattern, these materials avoid conventional magnetic order. Instead, their magnetic moments remain strongly quantum-entangled and in constant collective motion at temperatures close to absolute zero, producing behavior that resembles emergent quantum electrodynamics.\n\n\"We've answered a major open question by directly detecting these excitations,\" said Dai, the Sam and Helen Worden Professor of Physics and Astronomy. \"This confirms that Ce2Zr2O7 behaves as a true quantum spin ice, a special class of quantum spin liquids in three dimensions.\"\n\nCleaner Measurements With Polarized Neutron Scattering\n\nTo pin down these elusive signatures, the researchers relied on advanced polarized neutron scattering. This approach helped them isolate the magnetic scattering they cared about while filtering out other signals, even as the system approached the zero temperature limit.\n\nTheir measurements also revealed emergent photon signals near zero energy -- a defining trait that separates quantum spin ice from more familiar phases found in conventional magnets. Additional evidence came from specific heat measurements, which supported the idea that these predicted emergent photons follow a dispersion resembling the way sound moves through a solid.\n\nEarlier attempts to confirm this kind of behavior were often undermined by technical noise and incomplete data. The Rice-led team addressed those challenges through improved sample preparation and high-precision instruments, supported by an international effort involving major laboratories across Europe and North America.\n\nFirst-of-Its-Kind Observation With Big Implications\n\nIn this three-dimensional candidate material, the researchers observed both emergent photons and spinons -- key hallmarks of quantum spin ice. The result resolves a long-running debate in condensed matter physics and gives scientists a strong platform for studying next-generation quantum phenomena and potential technology pathways.\n\nBin Gao, a research scientist in Rice's Department of Physics and Astronomy and the study's first author, said the findings back up decades of theoretical expectations.\n\n\"This surprising result encourages scientists to look deeper into such unique materials, potentially changing how we understand magnets and the behavior of materials in the extreme quantum regime,\" Gao said.\n\nCo-authors of this study include Félix Desrochers and Yong Baek Kim of the University of Toronto; Rice alumnus David Tam of the Paul Scherrer Institut; Silke Paschen, Diana Kirschbaum and Duy Ha Nguyen of Vienna University of Technology; Paul Steffens and Arno Hiess of the Institut Laue-Langevin; Yixi Su of Jülich Centre of Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum; and Sang-Wook Cheong of Rutgers University.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Robert A.

    "fullText": "Welcome to our annual list of the worst, least successful, and simply dumbest technologies of the year.\n\nThis year, politics was a recurring theme. Donald Trump swept back into office and used his executive pen to reshape the fortunes of entire sectors, from renewables to cryptocurrency. The wrecking-ball act began even before his inauguration, when the president-elect marketed his own memecoin, $TRUMP, in a shameless act of merchandising that, of course, we honor on this year’s worst tech list.\n\nWe like to think there’s a lesson in every technological misadventure. But when technology becomes dependent on power, sometimes the takeaway is simpler: it would have been better to stay away.\n\nThat was a conclusion Elon Musk drew from his sojourn as instigator of DOGE, the insurgent cost-cutting initiative that took a chainsaw to federal agencies. The public protested. Teslas were set alight, and drivers of his hyped Cybertruck discovered that instead of a thumbs-up, they were getting the middle finger.\n\nOn reflection, Musk said he wouldn’t do it again. “Instead of doing DOGE, I would have, basically … worked on my companies,” he told an interviewer this month. “And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars.”\n\nRegrets—2025 had a few. Here are some of the more notable ones.\n\nImagine a metal butler that fills your dishwasher and opens the door. It’s a dream straight out of science fiction. And it’s going to remain there—at least for a while.\n\nThat was the hilarious, and deflating, takeaway from the first reviews of NEO, a 66-pound humanoid robot whose maker claims it will “handle any of your chores reliably” when it ships next year.\n\nBut as a reporter for the Wall Street Journal learned, NEO took two minutes to fold a sweater and couldn’t crack a walnut. Not only that, but the robot was teleoperated the entire time by a person wearing a VR visor.\n\nStill interested? Neo is available on preorder for $20,000 from startup 1X.\n\nMore: I Tried the Robot That’s Coming to Live With You. It’s Still Part Human (WSJ), The World’s Stupidest Robot Maid (The Daily Show) Why the humanoid workforce is running late (MIT Technology Review), NEO The Home Robot | Order Today (1X Corp.)\n\nIt’s been said that San Francisco is the kind of place where no one will tell you if you have a bad idea. And its biggest product in a decade—ChatGPT—often behaves exactly that way.\n\nThis year, OpenAI released an especially sycophantic update that told users their mundane queries were brilliantly incisive. This electronic yes-man routine isn’t an accident; it’s a product strategy. Plenty of people like the flattery.\n\nBut it’s disingenuous and dangerous, too. Chatbots have shown a willingness to indulge users’ delusions and worst impulses, up to and including suicide.\n\nIn April, OpenAI acknowledged the issue when the company dialed back a model update whose ultra-agreeable personality, it said, had the side effect of “validating doubts, fueling anger, urging impulsive actions, or reinforcing negative emotions.”\n\nDon’t you dare agree the problem is solved. This month, when I fed ChatGPT one of my dumbest ideas, its response began: “I love this concept.”\n\nMore: What OpenAI Did When ChatGPT Users Lost Touch With Reality (New York Times), Sycophantic AI Decreases Prosocial Intentions and Promotes Dependence (arXiv), Expanding on what we missed with sycophancy (OpenAI)\n\nWhen you tell a lie, tell it big. Make it frolic and give it pointy ears. And make it white. Very white.\n\nThat’s what the Texas biotech concern Colossal Biosciences did when it unveiled three snow-white animals that it claimed were actual dire wolves, which went extinct more than 10 millennia ago.\n\nTo be sure, these genetically modified gray wolves were impressive feats of engineering. They’d been made white via a genetic mutation and even had some bits and bobs of DNA copied over from old dire wolf bones. But they “are not dire wolves,” according to canine specialists at the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\nColossal’s promotional blitz could hurt actual endangered species. Presenting de-extinction as “a ready-to-use conservation solution,” said the IUCN, “risks diverting attention from the more urgent need of ensuring functioning and healthy ecosystems.”\n\nIn a statement, Colossal said that sentiment analysis of online activity shows 98% agreement with its furry claims. “They’re dire wolves, end of story,” it says.\n\nMore: Game of Clones: Colossal’s new wolves are cute, but are they dire?

Kennedy Jr., “mRNA” has become a political slur.\n\nIn August, Kennedy abruptly canceled hundreds of millions in contracts for next-generation vaccines. And shot maker Moderna—once America’s champion—has seen its stock slide by more than 90% since its Covid peak.\n\nThe purge targeting a key molecule of life (our bodies are full of mRNA) isn’t just bizarre. It could slow down other mRNA-based medicine, like cancer treatments and gene editing for rare diseases.\n\nIn August, a trade group fought back, saying: “Kennedy’s unscientific and misguided vilification of mRNA technology and cancellation of grants is the epitome of cutting off your nose to spite your face.”\n\nMore: HHS Winds Down mRNA Vaccine Development (US Department of Health and Human Services),  Cancelling mRNA studies is the highest irresponsibility (Nature), How Moderna, the company that helped save the world, unraveled (Stat News)\n\nWikipedia has editions in 340 languages. But as of this year, there’s one less: Wikipedia in Greenlandic is no more.\n\nOnly around 60,000 people speak the Inuit language. And very few of them, it seems, ever cared much about the online encyclopedia. As a result, many of the entries were machine translations riddled with errors and nonsense.\n\nPerhaps a website no one visits shouldn’t be a problem. But its existence created the risk of a linguistic “doom spiral” for the endangered language. That could happen if new AIs were trained on the corrupt Wikipedia articles.\n\nIn September, administrators voted to close Greenlandic Wikipedia, citing possible “harm to the Greenlandic language.”\n\nThere’s a reason we’re late to the hate-fest around Elon Musk’s Cybertruck. That’s because 12 months ago, the polemical polygon was the #1 selling electric pickup in the US.\n\nSo maybe it would end up a hit.\n\nNope. Tesla is likely to sell only around 20,000 trucks this year, about half last year’s total. And a big part of the problem is that the entire EV pickup category is struggling. Just this month, Ford decided to scrap its own EV truck, the F-150 Lightning.\n\nWith unsold inventory building, Musk has started selling Cybertrucks as fleet vehicles to his other enterprises, like SpaceX.\n\nMore: Elon’s Edsel: Tesla Cybertruck Is The Auto Industry’s Biggest Flop In Decades (Forbes), Why Tesla Cybertrucks Aren't Selling (CNBC), Ford scraps fully-electric F-150 Lightning as mounting losses and falling demand hits EV plans (AP)\n\nDonald Trump launched a digital currency called $TRUMP just days before his 2025 inauguration, accompanied by a logo showing his fist-pumping “Fight, fight, fight” pose.\n\nThis was a memecoin, or shitcoin, not real money. Memecoins are more like merchandise—collectibles designed to be bought and sold, usually for a loss. Indeed, they’ve been likened to a consensual scam in which a coin’s issuer can make a bundle while buyers take losses.\n\nThe White House says there’s nothing amiss. “The American public believe[s] it's absurd for anyone to insinuate that this president is profiting off of the presidency,” said spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt in May.\n\nMore: Donald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure (Bloomberg), A crypto mogul who invested millions into Trump coins is getting a reprieve (CNN), How the Trump companies made $1 bn from crypto (Financial Times), Staff Statement on Meme Coins (SEC)\n\nIn 2023, Apple announced its “first-ever carbon-neutral product,” a watch with “zero” net emissions. It would get there using recycled materials and renewable energy, and by preserving forests or planting vast stretches of eucalyptus trees.\n\nCritics say it’s greenwashing. This year, lawyers filed suit in California against Apple for deceptive advertising, and in Germany, a court ruled that the company can’t advertise products as carbon neutral because the “supposed storage of CO2 in commercial eucalyptus plantations” isn’t a sure thing.\n\nApple’s marketing team relented. Packaging for its newest watches doesn’t say “carbon neutral.” But Apple believes the legal nitpicking is counterproductive, arguing that it can only “discourage the kind of credible corporate climate action the world needs.”\n\nMore: Inside the controversial tree farms powering Apple’s carbon neutral goal (MIT Technology Review), Apple Watch not a 'CO2-neutral product,' German court finds (Reuters), Apple 2030: Our ambition to become carbon neutral (Apple)\n\nWe asked Al Jean, the longest-serving showrunner, about all the conspiracy theories.\n\nIt’s a popular example of the “Mandela effect,” or a collective false memory.

    "description": "Discover the inside story of Google Sans, Google’s iconic brand typeface. From product lockups to code, learn how the Google Sans font family has evolved to solve specific UX design problems.",
    "fullText": "How seven design problems shaped Google’s iconic typeface — from inception to going open-source\n\nSometimes, design elements are birthed in flashes of inspiration — What if our interfaces were like paper? What if YouTube was a little more pink? — but not Google’s brand typeface.\n\nGoogle Sans is the iconic typeface used across every Google product from Search to Wallet. It’s one of the most-served fonts on the internet, clocking in at some 120 billion font requests a month. It wasn’t born from a single brilliant sprint or creative spark. It evolved as the answer to a set of specific design problems, an answer that continued to expand and adapt to meet the shifting needs of users, designers, and developers. Now, after nearly a decade on Pixel phones and in Google apps, Google Sans is making its next big move: going open-source.\n\nRead on for a brief history of Google’s beloved font, told through the design problems that shaped it.\n\nThe 2015 logo redesign was a smashing success. But even before its pixels were perfected, the team realized their work was only just beginning. Hundreds of product lockups — the fixed arrangement of the logo paired with each product name — had to be updated to match.\n\n“The majority of how people experience the Google brand is through typography, whether that’s in a product, marketing, or content. We had the Google logo and identity framework, but we were missing that connective tissue,” explains Ken Frederick, former UX Lead for Google’s Brand Studio.\n\nDesigners considered treating each lockup as a unique logo, but the sheer volume of work made this approach unscalable. So, a new typeface was born based on the clean geometric forms of the new logo: Product Sans. The font’s repeating geometric shapes and tightly spaced characters made it perfectly suited for big product names at big sizes. Many Google apps still use these lockups today.\n\nIf a designer sees a gorgeous typeface, they’ll want to use it. Team members in Marketing loved the look of Product Sans and asked for it to be expanded for use in advertising. But in practice, the typeface fell short when you only had a couple of seconds to catch consumers’ eyes. At the same time, product designers started playing around with using Product Sans in interfaces. The results? Not great. Product Sans wasn’t optimal for lengthy passages of text, or at the smaller text sizes used on phones and tablets. Google’s designers needed a more versatile brand typeface. Enter: Google Sans.\n\n“It wasn't a top-down decision,” notes Tobias Kunisch, Design Lead for Google Fonts. “Google Sans was driven by the needs of designers, with product teams showing what was needed. That’s how our brand font really came together.”\n\nThe Google Fonts team learned from their experience with Product Sans and asked Colophon Foundry to meticulously optimize the character shapes, terminals, ascenders, descenders, x-heights, and stroke contrasts of the new typeface, ensuring that Google Sans would perform beautifully in large display text across both marketing and product surfaces. This is the iconic Google typeface that you see everywhere from billboards to UI headlines.\n\nWhen Google Sans rolled out in 2018, designers were initially ecstatic. “It meant we could finally use typography for a stronger brand statement,” recalls UX Designer Miche Alvarez. “But it also created a dual-font system using Google Sans for larger display text and Roboto for smaller text. It ended up being a compromise.”\n\nDesigners fought for a Google Sans version that would work at smaller sizes. So the team collaborated with designers in Search and at Colophon Foundry to refine the font, ultimately launching Google Sans Text (GST) in 2020.\n\nUnlike the geometric Google Sans, the characters in Google Sans Text are taller, more condensed, and less circular. The typeface also includes more spacing between characters to aid readability. The numerals are less geometric, and the angled cuts on terminals are less severe, creating a more uniform and readable experience, even at small sizes. It was also designed to match the proportions of Roboto, Android’s default typeface, to make switching from Roboto a smoother process.\n\nGoogle Sans Text rolled out on the Pixel 3, creating a more unified typographic experience.\n\nProduct teams eagerly adopted Google Sans and Google Sans Text but soon highlighted a new issue: Billions of people around the globe use non-Latin scripts like Arabic, Chinese, and Thai — writing systems not included in the initial character sets of Google Sans.\n\n“Our mission is ‘to organize the world's information,’” explains Dave Crossland, the Lead UX Program Manager for Google Fonts. “There was a clear need to expand Google Sans to all the languages that Google’s products get localized into.”\n\nThe effort was monumental. It meant meticulously crafting hundreds of thousands of new glyphs across more than 20 additional writing systems, each with its own unique design principles and visual nuances. The undertaking involved collaborating with expert type foundries worldwide, specialists familiar with the intricate requirements of each script — from the flowing curves of Arabic to the complex strokes of Japanese and the distinct forms of Ge’ez, the script used for Ethiopian and other languages in that region.\n\nAll together, this massive global language support makes Google Sans one of the world’s largest typeface families.\n\nGoogle Sans Mono was created in 2020 to support contexts that needed fixed-width characters for editorial design, at medium and large text sizes. Despite this, it soon got its first big product integration, replacing Roboto Mono in Google Chat. The only problem? Developers hated it.\n\nBecause the font wasn’t intended to be used at smaller sizes, the letterforms weren’t legible. It was especially difficult to tell the a and o apart. “That can actually be catastrophic for code,” says Tobias Kunisch. “One misplaced character can break an entire program.”\n\nRecognizing this critical need, a dedicated effort was launched to craft Google Sans Code, a monospaced typeface specifically designed to make code more readable. This involved thorough research into the 20 most common programming languages and how developers interact with code, aiming to make the new coding typeface more visually appealing while reducing the ambiguity of similar-looking letterforms. Based on these insights, Google tasked the Universal Thirst foundry to meticulously focus on specific letters, numbers, and operators to meet these requirements. The result is an eminently readable and surprisingly playful typeface.\n\nGoogle Sans Code launched as an open-source font in 2025, and is the typeface used to display code in Gemini.\n\nAs interfaces grow more dynamic and personal, our designers need typography that does more than just present information; the type should also convey feeling and adapt to varying contexts and states. While Google Sans was clear and effective, it didn’t offer the nuanced expressive range required to truly match a product’s mood or a user’s preference.\n\nThis led us to collaborate with the pioneers in variable font technology at Font Bureau to create Google Sans Flex. Unlike traditional fonts that have a handful of fixed styles like bold and italic, Google Sans Flex offers granular control over six different design axes: weight, width, optical size, slant, grade, and roundedness.\n\n“Google Sans Flex is a power tool for expression,” says Google Fonts Product Manager Sophia Siao. “Different combinations of axes can unlock a huge range of feeling and emotion, all while preserving a cohesive reading experience.”\n\nGoogle Sans Flex lets designers “sculpt” UI text with remarkable precision. Imagine making text feel “calm as a whisper” or “loud and rugged” simply by adjusting its weight, or evoking a “personal, playful” tone by fine-tuning its roundness. Our designers were particularly excited by the ability to precisely adjust how rounded or soft the text appears; these subtle shifts deeply influence how readers experience and connect with a design.\n\nThis expressive power isn’t just about aesthetics; it directly impacts how users experience Google products. Our research engaged over 3,000 readers, which taught us one thing: flexibility matters. Readers found the taller, more elegant styles to be more premium and engaging than standard fonts. This adaptability doesn't just look better; it allows designers to tailor readability for every specific use case. The optical size axis intelligently adapts letter shapes to maintain readable proportions at any size, from a smartwatch to a billboard, ensuring that expressiveness never comes at the expense of legibility. The typeface was recognized as a Red Dot Winner 2024.\n\nUltimately, Google Sans Flex empowers designers to infuse interfaces with distinct personality and nuance, creating digital experiences that feel more intuitive, personal, and genuinely helpful.\n\nGoogle Sans launched as a proprietary brand typeface — meaning that it could only be used in Google products. While that control was great for protecting Google’s brand, it created a fragmented typographic experience across the digital ecosystem. You might see Google Sans in Gmail, then open WhatsApp and see Roboto or a device-specific font. It’s a persistent, if subtle, point of friction.\n\n“It just doesn’t feel as nice,” stresses Visual Designer Megan Lynch. “On a subconscious level it impacts the experience.” This fragmented visual language, unlike the unified font experiences on some other platforms, made the digital journey less than seamless.\n\nSo this year — 2025 — Google decided to make Google Sans and Google Sans Flex open-source. It isn’t just about making a great font available; it’s about fostering a more consistent and polished digital environment for everyone. By offering Google Sans and Google Sans Flex to the wider community, we hope more developers and designers will bridge the visual gap between first-party and third-party apps. The goal is a more unified experience across devices and platforms, creating clearer, more comfortable interfaces for users wherever they engage with technology.\n\nThe story of Google Sans is a masterclass in need-based design — it was created not by a single flash of inspiration, but a thoughtful, human-centered evolution. Each problem, from misaligned lockups to illegible code, revealed an unmet need and ultimately led to innovation and improved user experience.\n\nTry Google Sans Flex, as well as our other fonts, at Google Fonts.\n\nSpecial thanks to the hundreds of people who have contributed to making and evolving Google Sans, including: Akaki Razmadze, Aleksandra Samulenkova, Alex Blattmann, Alexei Vanyashin, Ali Almasri, Anagha Narayanan, Anaïs Lievens, Andy Stewart, Anonta Mon, Anthony Sheret, Anurag Gautam, Anuthin Wongsunkakon, Ashler, Ben Mitchell (Fontpad), Bianca Berning, Black Foundry, Borna Izadpanah, Botio Nikoltchev, Cadson Demak, Carmen Eva Marseille, Chris Simpkins, Colophon Foundry, Dalton Maag, Damien Correll, Daniel Grumer, Daniel Yacob, Dave Crossland, David Berlow, Denis Moyogo Jacquerye, Edd Harrington, Eduardo Rennó, Elena Peralta, Erin McLaughlin, Fiona Ross, Font Bureau, Fontef, Gor Design, Gor Jihanian, Gunjan Panchal, Gunnar Vilhjálmsson, Hanna Donker, Harry Dalton, Hilary Palmén, Hitesh Malaviya, Irene Vlachou, Jack McCabe, Jamra Patel, Jany Belluz, Jimmy Mooney, Joana Ranito, Jonathan Lee, Jonny Pinhorn, Jotika Khur-Yearn, Kalapi Gajjar, Khaled Hosny, Knaz Uiyamathiti, Lipi Raval, Mamoun Sakkal, Marc Foley, Marianna Paszkowska, Mark Jamra, Megan Lynch, Meir Sadan, Michele Patanè, Mike Guss, Mohamed Gaber, Namrata Goyal, Nance Cunningham, Natalia Qadreh, Neil Patel, Nikolaus Waxweiler, Omer Ziv, Pablo Bosch, Panuwat Usakunwathana, Pathum Egodawatta, Patrick McCormick, Pratyush Das, Riccardo De Franceschi, Richard Bailey, Ricky Atkins, Salomi Desai, Samir Souza Reis, Santiago Orozco, Simon Cozens, Sophia Siao, Sovichet Tep, Stephen Morey, Suppakit Chalermlarp, Tobias Kunisch, U+ Type, Universal Thirst, Vaishnavi Murthy, Yanek Iontef, and Ye Myat Lwin.\n\nShout out to Sarah Daily and Susanna Zaraysky for additional reporting.

    "fullText": "A new poll indicates that support for President Trump is dwindling. Shockingly, that decline seems to be chiefly among MAGA and party-line Republicans. Support for the MAGA movement has also declined, with more Republicans identifying with the party rather than with Trump.\n\nThe new NBC News poll shows that the number of Americans who “strongly approve” of Trump has dropped from 26% in April to 21% now. The same survey also found the number of MAGA Republicans dropped from 78% to 70% in the same period.\n\nOn the flip side, the number of people who “strongly disapprove” of Trump increased from 42% to 44% from April to now. MAGA itself has also seen a decline since April, with the number of Republicans viewing themselves as part of the movement falling from 57% to 50%.\n\nMany of those surveyed cited financial concerns, particularly those surrounding food, affordable housing, and health care, as being the most critical issue to them. Many households are tightening their belts by cutting back on groceries, entertainment, and holiday spending.\n\nWhile overall inflation is down to 3%, costs have decreased for only a few goods, and wages haven’t increased meaningfully for most workers. As a result, some economists fear that stagflation might be a risk heading into 2026. Trump’s promise to end inflation and revitalize the economy has rang hollow for many voters. After a year, the majority of those surveyed found themselves in the same or worse position than a year ago.\n\nThe erosion is subtle but notable. Republican voters are not necessarily moving left, but they are showing fatigue with personality-driven politics. The poll suggests a growing desire for stability, predictability, and concrete economic relief. Whether that sentiment translates into lower turnout, primary challenges, or quiet disengagement could shape the party’s strategy heading into the 2026 midterm election cycle.\n\nThe post Poll Shows Shocking Trump Approval Number Change appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "description": "China has reportedly built and begun testing a secret EUV lithography prototype using ASML-style laser-produced plasma technology. Yet, despite generating 13.5-nm light, the system remains unable to make chips and appears to be years away from achieving a complete, production-ready EUV manufacturing capability.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nA secret laboratory in China has quietly assembled a prototype extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography system and is now testing it stealthily, which means that the country may be close to replicating the most advanced technology that currently exists on Earth, reports Reuters.\n\nThe tool was reportedly developed by reverse engineering existing scanners from ASML and is said to be on-track to make prototype chips in 2028. If the information is correct, then Chinese scientists have made numerous breakthroughs across multiple disciplines in just a few years instead of decades, a scenario that appears extremely unlikely. Further analysis of the report indicates that China's laboratory is far from completing the tool, meaning that the country is years away from making chips using EUV lithography.\n\nThe system was reportedly completed in early 2025 inside a highly secured facility in Shenzhen and occupies nearly an entire factory floor. The Chinese machine reportedly generates EUV light with a wavelength of 13.5nm using the same laser-produced plasma (LPP) method as ASML Twinscan NXE machines, not the particle accelerator-based steady-state microbunching (SSMB) method designed at Tsinghua University or discharge-produced plasma (DPP) technology developed at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), which might prove the point that the system was reverse-engineered or at least contains a substantial amount of technologies pioneered by ASML.\n\nASML's laser-produced plasma (LPP) method uses tiny molten tin droplets, roughly 25–30 microns in diameter, which are injected into a vacuum chamber at a rate of about 50,000 droplets per second. Then, a high-power CO₂ laser first fires a low-intensity pre-pulse at each droplet, flattening it into a disk-like shape, followed by a more powerful main pulse that vaporizes the flattened tin and creates a superheated plasma with temperatures exceeding 200,000°C. This plasma emits isotropic EUV light, which is then collected by a large multilayer collector mirror and directed into the lithography system's reflective optics for patterning silicon wafers. This process repeats tens of thousands of times per second.\n\nThe machine is reportedly larger than the original, but it is operational in the sense that it can generate EUV radiation. However, it has not progressed to make usable chips as it still struggles to replicate 'the precision optical systems' features by Twinscan NXE systems. Furthermore, there is no word about power of the EUV light source, a crucial parameter that defines whether a tool can or cannot be used for volume production.\n\nThe report clearly states that the Chinese EUV scanner cannot currently be used to make chips, but the Chinese government reportedly wants the first chip prototypes to emerge in 2028, two or three years down the road. However, a more realistic target is 2030, four or five years from now, which is a long time. Meanwhile, from the report, it is not completely clear what stage the Chinese team is at today.\n\nThe report does not disclose which specific components of the optical system are the primary bottlenecks, as the article groups them rather generally. In particular, it is uncertain if the alleged EUV tool struggles to replicate the ultra-precise collector mirror system coated with multilayer molybdenum-silicon (Mo/Si) stacks, illuminator optics (which shapes and uniforms the beam using faceted mirrors), or projection optics (a series of aspheric mirrors for 4X – 8X reduction imaging with sub-nanometer wavefront errors). ASML outsources the development and production of these components to Carl Zeiss from Germany. If the developers failed to replicate the collector itself, then the rest of the machine can hardly be called an EUV lithography system, as technically, the only thing they have is some kind of light source that they have yet to learn how to use. Yet, even if the developers cannot replicate illuminator optics or projection optics (suggesting that the collector itself is there), it still means they do not have even a poorly working EUV lithography tool, but rather a set of certain components.\n\nWhen talking about advanced lithography equipment, we must keep in mind that such tools rely on seamless integration of sophisticated light sources, advanced optics, ultra-precise mechanical engineering, complex control software, and specialized materials, all of which must function reliably within nanometer-scale tolerances demanded by modern chip manufacturing. The story has no word about the state of the mechanical systems of the alleged tool: we know nothing about the wafer stocker system, wafer stages, or reticle stages, all of which are crucial for operation and yields.\n\nTo put China's EUV efforts into perspective, the secret lab is not even close to building an alpha tool. For now, what the Chinese lab has cannot even put the light on a wafer, save for printing lines and spaces, something ASML's tool could do in 2006, about 11 years before the company shipped its first Twinscan NXE:3400B system meant for high-volume manufacturing. Of course, reverse engineering certain components can give Chinese engineers a speed boost, but it remains to be seen how significant this one is going to be.\n\nAccording to Reuters's sources familiar with the effort, the Chinese EUV tool was 'developed' by a team that includes former engineers from ASML and recent university graduates, who allegedly reverse-engineered the company's EUV machines. The secret lab was so stealthy that its employees were given fake IDs to avoid detection of their concentration in one place by foreign spies.\n\nYet, it is unclear how any engineers from China could reverse engineer an EUV lithography scanner, as the Dutch company has never supplied one to China and hardly taught personnel from China how to service its EUV systems that are not allowed to be shipped to the People's Republic.\n\nReverse engineering a machine that contains over 100,000 parts is a hard task that takes hundreds of engineers with knowledge of the matter, which is why the secret entity led by the Government of China hired not only former engineers from ASML China, but also former employees of the Dutch company from elsewhere, presumably from Europe, Taiwan, and the U.S. For example, Lin Nan, formerly responsible for EUV light source technology at ASML, now leads a team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Shanghai Institute of Optics that has filed eight EUV-related patents in just 18 months. Yet, this may mean that he uses his experience and knowledge rather than trying to replicate what he did at ASML or reverse engineer what he did at ASML due to the absence of an EUV scanner in his lab.\n\n“It makes sense that companies would want to replicate our technology, but doing so is no small feat,” a statement by ASML published by Reuters reads.\n\nThe report says that around 100 recent university graduates are tasked with reverse-engineering parts from EUV and DUV lithography tools, with each workplace monitored by a dedicated camera that records the disassembly and reassembly process, an important part of the whole China's lithography program, according to the report. Employees who successfully put components back together receive bonuses. Yet again, a Twinscan NXE tool is a mechanism consisting of over 100,000 parts working together, not just a sum of all parts.\n\nTo sum up, China has reportedly built a secret prototype EUV lithography system and begun testing it, which suggests that the country may be closer to reproducing the most advanced chipmaking technology in existence than previously believed. However, details provided by the report indicate that China is still years — if not a decade — away from making chips using EUV lithography.\n\nThe machine can generate 13.5-nm EUV light using the same laser-produced plasma (LPP) method employed by ASML, which may demonstrate extensive reverse engineering of Western technology rather than the use of alternative domestic approaches. However, the tool is significantly larger than commercial systems available today, it cannot produce usable chips, and appears to struggle with other elements of EUV lithography, particularly ultra-precise optics supplied to ASML by Carl Zeiss. In fact, details about the system like light source power, optical subsystem maturity, and the state of critical mechanical components remain unclear.\n\nWhile China expects first prototype EUV chips to emerge in 2028, Reuters's sources suggest 2030 is more realistic. Yet, the whole effort relies heavily on recruiting former ASML engineers and reverse engineering parts from existing EUV and DUV tools, which are not only hard to develop, but are extremely hard to make. Meanwhile, there is no word whether the current team responsible for disassembling and reassembling components can actually make an ultra-complex machine consisting of over 100,000 parts work flawlessly to produce semiconductors in high volumes.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.",

    "description": "Authorities announced they tracked down the man responsible for the deadly Brown University shooting that rocked the Ivy League institution.",
    "fullText": "Authorities on Dec. 18 announced they tracked down the man responsible for both the deadly Brown University shooting and the shooting death of Nuno F.G. Loureiro, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor two days later, and found him dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at a Salem, Massachusetts storage unit.\n\nClaudio Manuel Neves Valente, 48, originally from Portugal, was a former Brown University PhD physics student, who knew Loureiro, authorities said at two separate news conferences on the night of Dec. 18.\n\nInvestigators said they identified Valente on the afternoon of Dec. 17 and were able to connect him to both crime scenes through financial background information, including car rental records for the car he rented and drove to Providence and back to Massachusetts.\n\nThe Brown shootings rocked the Ivy League School and the school's surrounding community.\n\nAuthorities at the news conference in Boston, said Valente was \"sophisticated in covering his tracks,\" including obscuring his cell phone so it couldn't be tracked, switching plates on his rental car andnot using credit cards in his name.\n\nAn affidavit signed by a Rhode Island district judge said police cracked the case after a tipster recognized a rental car circling the area. The tipster said police should be looking for a gray Nissan Altima and license plate, information the police hadn't previously released. Police then tracked down images of Neves Valente renting the car at an Alamo location in Boston.\n\nHere's what to know about the shooter:\n\nNeves Valente entered the country in 2000 on a student F-1 visa. He was admitted as a lawful permanent resident in 2017.\n\nBrown officials say he was a PhD student before taking a leave of absence in April 2001. He withdrew on July 31, 2003. His last known address was in Miami, according to police.\n\nThe tipster took his information first to the social media site Reddit, posting: \"I'm being dead serious. The police need to look into a grey Nissan with Florida plates, possibly a rental,\" John, whose last name is being withheld by authorities, wrote, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe announcement comes after authorities urged the public to help with the widening investigation and dayslong search for the person suspected of carrying out the attack. Earlier in the week, authorities released enhanced images and video footage of the person investigators believe could be tied to the shooting that killed two people and injured nine others.\n\nProvidence Police Chief Oscar Perez said investigators had evidence that the possible suspect was near the university hours before the shooting. Footage from neighborhood cameras shared by authorities showed the person in dark clothing and wearing a mask walking along streets a few blocks away from the campus on Dec. 13.\n\nInvestigators believe it was likely the person was \"casing\" the scene, according to Perez.\n\n\"There's a lot of leads we have here that show that the person who committed this tragedy is the guy in this video,\" the police chief said.\n\nThough officials said on Dec. 16 that they were confident the person in the video is the suspect, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha noted that they had \"zero\" evidence for the motive in the attack. Witnesses said the person was likely in his 30s, and it was unclear if they were affiliated with the university, Perez said.\n\n'Bright light' and 'role model.' Brown University victims remembered\n\nPolice received more than 200 tips since the shooting, according to Perez. The police chief had asked for the public’s help in identifying the suspected gunman, saying investigators were hoping the new footage would help someone recognize the person.\n\n\"Focus on the body movements, the way the person moved their arms, the body posture, the way they carry the weight,\" Perez said. “I think those are important movement patterns that may help you identify this individual, which is extremely important.”\n\nThe footage included a timeline video that comprised surveillance video from neighborhood cameras and a vehicle’s dash camera.\n\nIn one video, the suspected shooter can be seen leaving the scene of the shooting as a police car with flashing emergency lights arrives. The final video shows the suspect walking along that street just minutes after the attack.\n\nThe shooting at the Ivy League University occurred shortly before 4:05 p.m. local time on Dec. 13 in an engineering building with unlocked doors as final exams were underway. Authorities said the suspect opened fire with a 9mm gun inside a classroom and then fled.\n\nThe shooting prompted a campus lockdown that left students barricaded in rooms or hiding for hours. Officers recovered 9mm shell casings from the scene, and Perez said investigators believe the suspect \"definitely targeted Brown University.\"\n\nTwo students were killed, and nine others were injured in the attack. The two students killed were identified as Ella Cook, a sophomore from Mountain Brook, Alabama, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, a freshman from Virginia who immigrated from Uzbekistan.\n\nAs of Dec. 16, two of the wounded students were released from the hospital. Of the seven people who remained hospitalized, authorities said one was in critical condition, five were in critical but stable condition, and one was in stable condition.\n\nBrown University, which has nearly 11,000 undergraduate and graduate students, is considered one of the most prestigious colleges in the country. Brown was founded in 1764 and is located in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Brown, MIT suspect found dead.

    "description": "“Where these sea raiders might have come from, and why they attacked the island of Als has long been a mystery.”",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nResearchers discovered a fingerprint on Scandinavia’s oldest plank boat, used by seaborne raiders over 2,000 years ago.\n\nThe print was left in the caulking tar by one of the boat’s makers.\n\nExperts still hope the fingerprint can point to clues about who the raiders were and why they attacked the island of Als.\n\nThe mystery of why a group of seaborne raiders attacked the Danish island of Als over 2,000 years ago just got one step closer to being solved. Researchers scoured Scandinavia’s oldest plank boat (likely used by the raiders), and discovered a fingerprint pressed into the tar caulking material. While this is an admittedly small piece of evidence, archaeologists still hope it can move them closer to figuring out just where the attackers came from.\n\nThe attack on the island of Als happened in the fourth century B.C.E., when an armada descended. Even with up to four boats in the attack, the island-dwellers were able to defend their home, sinking one of the boats in a bog (likely as an offering of thankfulness for victory) in the process. The boat—which was was first discovered in the 1880s and excavated in the 1920s—is now known as the Hjortspring boat, and is the only example of a prehistoric plank boat ever found in Scandinavia.\n\n“Where these sea raiders might have come from, and why they attacked the island of Als has long been a mystery,” Mikael Fauvelle, an archaeologist from Lund University, said in a statement.\n\nWith the Hjortspring boat on display at the National Museum of Denmark, the university research team still unexpectedly found parts of the boat that hadn’t been chemically preserved, and studied them with modern tools. “The boat was waterproofed with pine pitch, which was surprising,” Fauvelle said. “This suggests the boat was built somewhere with abundant pine forests.”\n\nPreviously, scholars thought that the raiders must haveoriginated from modern-day Hamburg, Germany. But the researchers, who published their findings on the investigation into the lost pieces of the Hjortspring boat in the journal PLOS One, now say that the clues point to the Baltic Sea region as the origin point of the attack. The authors wrote that the use of pine pitch means the boats must have been made in a region abundant with pine forests, like the Baltic Sea region east of Rugen and Scania.\n\n“If the boat came from the pine forest-rich coastal regions of the Baltic Sea, it means that the warriors who attacked the island of Als chose to launch a maritime raid over hundreds of kilometers of open sea,” Fauvelle said.\n\nThe researchers used all the tools at their disposal to investigate the find, including carbon dating the lime bast cordage, which confirmed its pre-Roman Iron Age dating. They also used X-ray tomography for high-resolution scans, created a 3D model of the fingerprint, and employed chromatography and mass spectrometry to help see how the caulking tar was produced.\n\n“We are also hoping to be able to extract ancient DNA from the caulking tar on the boat, which could give us more detailed information on the ancient people who used this boat,” Fauvelle said.\n\nAnalyzing intact cordage fragments and imprints of cordage on caulking material helped experts divine the sewing and rope-making techniques originally used in the construction, and the partial human fingerprint provides a direct link to the ancient seafarers. “Together, these results shed new light on the methods and materials used to build Scandinavia’s first plank boats,” the authors wrote, “and raise new questions regarding our understating of early maritime societies in Northern Europe.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "References in U.S. Coast Guard policy calling hate symbols “potentially divisive\" were removed Thursday, and a U.S. senator said she was lifting a hold she had placed on a nomination for the service's top job.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose agency oversees the Coast Guard, said on social media that the latest changes were made so no one can “misrepresent” the branch's position.\n\n“The pages of superseded and outdated policy will be completely removed from the record so no press outlet, entity or elected official may misrepresent the Coast Guard to politicize their policies and lie about their position on divisive and hate symbols,” Noem said.\n\nThe move appears to cap off back-and-forth revisions to Coast Guard policy on swastikas, nooses and other hate symbols, which has sparked an uproar. The Department of Homeland Security has said there “was never a ‘downgrade’” in policy language.\n\nNoem's announcement came a day after Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada said she was holding up the nomination of Adm. Kevin Lunday for Coast Guard commandant because leadership appeared to have “backtracked” on a commitment that swastikas and nooses are considered hate symbols and prohibited from display.\n\nRosen said Thursday on social media that she was lifting the hold and looked forward to working with Lunday to continue strengthening anti-harassment policy at the Coast Guard.\n\n“While I continue to have reservations about the process by which this happened and the confusion created by leadership at the Department of Homeland Security, I am pleased to see that the policy now directly refers to stronger language against swastikas and nooses,” she said.\n\nNoem called the delay of Lunday's nomination a “politicized holdup,” saying it had gone on long enough and he should be confirmed without delay.\n\n“He has given nearly 39 years of distinguished service to the Coast Guard, this country, and the American people,” she said.\n\nThe Coast Guard’s planned policy change calling hate symbols \"potentially divisive\" emerged publicly last month. It stopped short of banning them, instead saying that commanders could take steps to remove them from public view and that the rule did not apply to private spaces, such as family housing.\n\nDHS has said the change “strengthens our ability to report, investigate, and prosecute those who violate longstanding policy.”\n\nThe Coast Guard said on social media that it “maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward hate symbols, extremist ideology, and any conduct that undermines our core values. We prohibit the display or promotion of hate symbols in any form. Any suggestion otherwise is false.\"\n\nThe Washington Post first reported the latest developments.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is already facing backlash for his so-called “warrior dividend” he announced during his national address on Wednesday night.\n\nTrump announced that 1.45 million military servicemembers will be receiving a $1,776 check ahead of Christmas as a result of tariff revenue and his “big beautiful bill” signed earlier this year. But skeptics immediately questioned how Trump was able to authorize sending out individual checks to service members without approval from Congress.\n\n“1,450,000 military service members will receive a special, we call warrior dividend before Christmas, a warrior dividend. In honor of our nation’s founding in 1776, we are sending every soldier $1,776. Think of that. And the checks are already on the way,” Trump said during his speech.\n\n“We made a lot more money than anybody thought because of tariffs, and the bill helped us along. Nobody deserves it more than our military. And I say congratulations to everybody. And by the way, we now have record enlistment in our military, and last year we had among the worst recruitment numbers in our military’s history. What a difference a year makes,” he added.\n\nHowever, online publication Defense One first reported that the funding for those checks actually comes from reconciliation funds that were approved by Congress to subsidize housing allowances for service members.\n\nA senior administration official told Defense One that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed the Pentagon “disburse $2.6 billion as a one-time basic allowance for housing supplement” to all eligible service members.\n\n“Congress appropriated $2.9 billion to the Department of War to supplement the Basic Allowance for Housing entitlement within The One Big Beautiful Bill,” the senior official told Defense One in a statement. “Approximately 1.28 million active component military members and 174,000 Reserve component military members will receive this supplement.”\n\nOVERNIGHT: President Trump’s $1,776 checks for 1.45 million troops announced Wednesday night come from Congressionally-allocated reconciliation funds intended to subsidize housing allowances for service members, a senior official confirmed to @DefenseOne.https://t.co/mGWski9Exl\n\n— Thomas Novelly (@TomNovelly) December 18, 2025\n\nThe report immediately sparked criticism on social media platform X.\n\n“I was wondering how Trump found his troop pay money without a congressional authorization/appropriation. He found it by taking it away from troop housing money. Always a con artist,” The Atlantic’s David Frum wrote on X.\n\nFormer Rep. Joe Walsh wrote: “Classic Trump. Everything he does is a lie, everything he does is just bullshit repackaging.”\n\nMeidasTouch editor-in-chief Ron Filipkowski posted: “Trump is taking money out their housing allowances approved by Congress and giving it to them in a ‘bonus’ so it looks like it came from him. It’s just a shell game with military pay from the ultimate con man.”\n\nNew Jersey Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D) said the “warrior dividend” is “no more than rebranded military housing allowances.”\n\n“Trump isn’t giving our brave service members a bonus, he’s just shuffling around money so he can claim he is. The level of disrespect for the intelligence of our troops is staggering,” she wrote on X.\n\nU.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), a veteran, also bashed Trump’s announcement.\n\n“Gee thanks, Donald. Your $1,776 ‘warrior checks’ aren’t Christmas bonuses—you’re just stealing money out of a fund meant to help our troops find affordable housing. Once a conman always a conman,\" Duckworth wrote.",

From this simple premise comes a joyful game of mindfulness and social interaction, as Alta learns how to serve up witty conversation and decent hot drinks. Colourful and highly stylised, it is a thoughtful study of burnout and recovery.\n\nInkle/Nintendo Switch, iPhone/iPad, Mac, PC\nAn attempted-murder mystery set in an a 1920s all-girls private school reveals itself to also be an eviscerating takedown of British class politics. Witty and beautifully drawn, it is full of amusing boarding-school stereotypes, from self-interested prefects to a terrifying matron, whose motivations and personal grievances must be slowly unpicked. It has the feel of a really excellent graphic novel.\n\nSupergiant Games, PC, Switch\n\n A stylish return to Greek mythology for developer Supergiant Games, this time starring daughter of the underworld Melinoë, who is trying to prevent the titan Chronos from destroying everything. You are aided in your attempts to kill Time by a range of absurdly attractive fellow immortals and vicious familiars. Repeated runs bring gradual mastery of Melinoë’s spells and weapons, tipping the scales of fate ever so slightly in your favour.\n\nSokpop Collectiv, PC\n\n A gardening sim that’s also a horror adventure, Grunn is a weird, often unsettling experiment in game design, set in a Dutch village inhabited by ghostly figures and intriguing secrets. Trim the lawn, collect photos, but be extremely careful when visiting the church or exploring that weird bunker beyond the hedgerow.\n\nMegagon Industries, PC, Xbox\n\n All is well with the world as you carve beautiful lines down pristine mountain snowscapes – until you smack into a rock or fly off a cliff, that is. Minimalist in both its aesthetic and its simple, stripped-back play, this is one of the best games ever made about skiing. Playing with other people adds a little enjoyable chaos to the experience, but Snow Riders is best when it’s just you and the mountain, and you’re testing your perseverance against a particularly challenging trail.\n\nNintendo, Switch 2\n\n Nintendo’s favourite ape returns in a wild take on the classic platform adventure, accompanied by series regular Pauline, who is able to attain shapeshifting magical powers. Instead of pixel-perfect jumps, you punch, crunch and blast your way through exotic locations, collecting power-ups and pulverising bosses, tearing up the Super Mario level design book as you go. Smashing.\n\nCapcom, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n Capcom’s spectacular monsters, from fluffy pink snarling apes to elder dragons that command lightning, have long been waiting for a world big enough to contain them. Wilds is that world: an expanse of desert, volcanic plains, jungle and icy peaks that provides the perfect habitats for an extraordinary, dangerous menagerie – and perfect arenas in which to fight them. The story is a thrill ride of escalatingly epic face-offs, but afterwards it opens up a vast menu of more challenging hunts.\n\nHazlelight Studios/Electronic Arts, PC, PS5, Switch, Xbox\n\n Two aspiring writers become trapped in each others’ stories in this eminently likable interactive take on buddy comedy. Except they’re not buddies: they’re polar opposites. Standoffish sci-fi writer Mio and happy-go-lucky fantasy writer Zoe come to understand each other better as they are forced to cooperate their way through the bizarre realms of their imagination Play transforms unpredictably every 20 minutes - one level could be all-action space-blasting, the next will have you puzzling through a fantasy jungle as transforming animals, and an unexpected diversion will have you working together to wriggle sentient hotdogs into buns. You’ll be brought closer to your player two as well, as navigating these collaborative scenarios requires communication, patience, and a sense of humour.\n\n11Bit Studios, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n After crash-landing on a planet supposedly rich in a valuable mineral, Jan Dolski finds himself all alone. The rest of the crew died on impact. So to keep the mission going, and escape an imminent sunrise that will fry him out of existence, he must clone himself to create a crew. After twenty-ish hours split between exploring a hostile planet, managing the base’s resources and managing the squabbles between all the alternate Jans, you will be left with a lot to ponder about how our life choices shape who we are.\n\nPanic, PC, PS4/5, Switch, Xbox\n\n Set at the time of Ecuador’s journey to the 2002 World Cup finals, Despelote is a beautifully designed semi-autobiographical adventure about a young boy and his obsession with the beautiful game. Focusing on families, childhood and the uniting power of fandom, it’s a unique take on the idea of a sports sim.\n\nTwo Point Studios/Sega, PC, PS5, Switch 2, Xbox\n\n The Two Point series of management sims has consistently combined humour and deep strategy to compelling effect, and the latest is no exception. Your role as museum manager is to gather exhibits from around the world then display them in an attractive setting to pull in visitors. Meanwhile there are staffing issues to contend with, and is your cafe serving nice enough snacks? It’s an engrossing challenge and the cartoon-style visuals provide plenty of amusing asides.\n\nSucker Punch/Sony, PS5\n\n A deliciously easy to enjoy and arrestingly beautiful samurai action game about a female warrior, Atsu, on a revenge quest, which unselfconsciously reproduces every possible trope of the genre, with panache. We have tense sword stand-offs under falling leaves. We have enemies eyeing each other menacingly from either side of a burning bridge. We have hot springs, shrines and quiet moments playing the shamisen or wielding a sumi-e ink brush. We have wolves and foxes leading us to secret spots in nature. And we have a selection of delightfully fun weapons and a seemingly endless horde of bandits and villains to use them on. Uncomplicated, beautifully made entertainment.\n\nKojima Productions/Sony, PS5\n\n Troubled delivery man and resistance hero Sam Bridges returns in Hideo Kojima’s visually astonishing, eccentric and engrossing sci-fi sequel. Moving the action to an apocalyptic Australia provides landscapes of stark beauty – and the odd kangaroo. And while the story is often indecipherable, the realisation of Kojima’s ghostly universe is incredible. This is a wasteland you can wallow in for months.\n\nSandfall/Keplar, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n An extravagantly French role-playing game in which a band of depressed people from a ravaged Paris set out to kill a supernatural painter, who wipes out a generation of people with a few strokes of her brush each year. It is surreal, exciting, melodramatic, sometimes self-indulgent, and strangely hopeful – a breath of fresh air even in a genre that’s hardly starved of stylish, thematically ambitious games.\n\nHexecutable, PC \n\n A satirical slice-of-life game about life as a dieting-obsessed teen in the 00s, Consume Me is extremely funny and has a point to make. Juggling studies with social time and walking the dog, Tetris-ing food on to your plate and and enduring excruciating conversations with your parents, all makes you properly relive the overwhelm and pressure of adolescent life. The presentation, meanwhile, is exuberantly, lovably absurd.\n\nNintendo, Switch 2\n\n The showcase title for the Switch 2 is another glorious addition to the Mario Kart universe, boasting a delightful cast of characters and 30 varied circuits joined by a network of highways that provide the chance to explore a wide open landscape for the first time in the series. Add in the wonderful soundtrack of electronic lounge jazz pop bangers and you have another family gaming staple that will remain on rotation for years.\n\nSpooky Doorway/Raw Fury, PC\n\n It’s the late 19th century and you’ve just arrived at a remote hotel in the west of Ireland to investigate the disappearance of a young woman. But as you dig for clues, the dead emerge from their graves – and they’re really not happy. Part Agatha Christie detective sim, part folk-horror opus, this is a fascinating and engrossing experience that has things to say about class, belief and colonialism.\n\nNeoBards/Konami, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n In 1960s Japan, a young girl’s fury at her bullying father becomes a spectral nightmare that consumes a whole town. Written by acclaimed visual novel author Ryukishi07, the game puts you in familiar Silent Hill territory, which means foggy streets, fiendish puzzles and truly horrible monsters. But by infusing the uncanny, mythology and superstition with feminist themes, it is an intriguing slant on a much loved (and feared) series.\n\nTeam Cherry, PC, PS4/5, Switch, Switch 2, Xbox\n\n Even the most tenacious player will feel like giving up at some point while trapped in Pharloom, a decaying realm full of desperate little bugs that was once a gleaming religious capital. Here lie some truly wretched places: former farms now fetid swamps, dank underground caverns overgrown with moss and misery, grand halls now dust-covered and reverberating with foreboding. And of course there are the guardians of these places, from mind-rotted beast-tamers to corrupted pilgrims and bug-automatons, silk-poisoned creatures and the realm’s former rulers, who stand in the way of your progress. Silksong’s most forbidding foes take hours to overcome. Its worst places will entrap you in despair. But it is worth it, because of the awe-inspiring moments that you will experience along the way: the hard-won victories, those first steps into previously locked-off realms, the secret revelations that seem so personal it’s hard to believe that any of the game’s millions of other players could discover them the same way. An extraordinary game whose sometimes extreme difficulty is both a strength and a weakness.\n\nDogubomb/Raw Fury, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n A young man inherits a mysterious mansion from his uncle: a sprawling pile whose layout changes every day. He needs only to find the secret 46th room, and the place is his for ever. The mansion turns out to be an education: on the personal history of the family that owned it, the mysterious forces that shaped it and the political climate of the wider world in which it is situated. But before you get anywhere near Blue Prince’s deeper mysteries, you must master its blueprints. Behind every door is a choice: do you draft a library? A hallway with several exits? A security room, a laboratory, a pool, a bedroom, a nursery, a drawing room? Each will have its own secrets to discover, a useful item or a key or a new piece of information that gets you ever closer to that elusive 46th room. And each might offer you a new path to the rest of the mansion, or locked doors that you haven’t the means to pass. Every day, with every new route that you carve through these rooms, every dead end you meet, your knowledge accumulates. By the time you do reach that final destination, you’ll have so many unanswered questions, you won’t be able to resist continuing. Blue Prince turns out to be an almost bottomless mystery, leaving you with pads full of notes, theories, numbers and names, lines from books that you want to remember and drawings of strange mechanisms. It is among the best puzzle games ever made: atmospheric and understated and unforgettably clever; still somehow able to show you something new even after tens of hours of patient exploration.",

    "fullText": "PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) – Clackamas County is facing a triple threat Thursday night as flood warnings impact at least three different rivers and major creeks.\n\nMolalla officials say the city could soon find itself cut off if those rivers — Clackamas River, Pudding River, and Johnson Creek — rise any higher.\n\nLIVE Updates: Atmospheric river hits Oregon, SW Washington, bringing intense rain, wind\n\nThe National Weather Service predicts that Johnson Creek will rise above flood stage at Sycamore Thursday afternoon, and the Clackamas River near Estacada is expected to reach major flood stage later in the night.\n\nBut for the city, impacts are already stacking up.\n\nUtility crews have been working along Hwy 213 between Molalla and Oregon City, repairing downed power lines after trees toppled in strong winds.\n\nPortland General Electric has reported widespread outages across Clackamas County with some residents going into day two without power. Conditions have prompted the Molalla River School District to cancel class Thursday as city officials call on residents to prepare for this next round of water.\n\n“If the Molalla River and some of those other rivers actually do reach flood stage, we kind of become isolated,” Molalla City Manager Dan Huff said. “So we become this island that is surrounded by water, and you can’t get out.”\n\nFor families who got in, Preschool For All changed everything\n\nHuff said crews are closely monitoring water intake and wastewater systems, which can quickly clog with debris in fast-moving water.\n\nThe Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office is urging people to avoid flooded roads, stay clear of downed power lines, never drive through standing water, and treat dark traffic signals as four-way stops.\n\nMeanwhile, in Southwest Beaverton, neighbors told KOIN 6 News they’ve seen the consequences of people trying to drive through roads with standing water.\n\n“Two days ago, somebody got stuck coming through and they tried to make it, and there was an electric car and they had to tow it away. So it’s not very, not very wise to go through something you can’t see,” said Mike Bailey. “There’s a ditch on both sides and I’ve seen people come around. They don’t know that there’s a ditch there and they just flop right into it. So we pulled pulled a couple people out of there.”\n\nIn Detroit, Oregon, Marion County officials are warning people to be aware of crews that might be parked on the side of the road amid the heavy rain and low visibility. Crews are currently responding to hundreds of trees that came down in the area.\n\nOfficials say this round of heavy rain is raising red flags. With no snowpack to slow it down, all that water is heading straight into local rivers.\n\nStay with KOIN 6 News as this story develops.",

    "fullText": "Perth is entering a new phase of a battle it never wanted to fight: protecting its tree canopy from a beetle no bigger than a sesame seed. After years of rapid spread and thousands of dead trees, officials are shifting from trying to wipe out the polyphagous shot-hole borer to figuring out how to live with it, 7News reported.\n\nWestern Australia has redrawn its quarantine map for the entire Perth metropolitan area, marking a major shift from the state's earlier, more aggressive attempts to eliminate the polyphagous shot-hole borer. The insect, first found in Fremantle in 2021, has carved through thousands of trees and forced removals in Hyde Park and Kings Park. With no effective chemical treatments and persistent challenges identifying early infestations, the state formally ended its push for eradication in June.\n\nIt was a pivot that alarmed experts. The Invasive Species Council warned the decision \"could put the rest of the country at risk.\"\n\nUnder the new plan, Perth is now split into two zones: an inner management zone where the borer is firmly established and an outer containment zone where officials hope to stop it from spreading further. The Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development will prioritize pruning and removals in the containment area to keep the beetle from reaching regional communities and agricultural corridors.\n\nInvasive species disrupt ecosystems by outcompeting native plants and animals and weakening the landscapes they've long supported. Once this beetle tunnels into a tree, it introduces a fungus that blocks the transport of water and nutrients, slowly starving the tree until it dies. Losing canopy cover affects everything from neighborhood heat levels to wildlife habitat to food-growing conditions.\n\n\"Early detection and management of high-risk infestations, particularly in the containment zone, remain critical to managing the spread and impact,\" DPIRD's Mia Carbon told 7News.\n\nSince native species often have no natural defenses against invaders, delays can give pests a massive advantage. That imbalance threatens biodiversity as well as soil and water health, and it increases the risk of future pest-borne diseases.\n\nDPIRD is working directly with affected property owners, giving them the option of pruning or removing for free trees that were selected during the eradication phase. They may also choose to manage their trees independently with department guidance. The state has committed 4.7 million Australian dollars to local governments in impacted areas and for research into treatment options.\n\nResidents can support containment by reporting suspicious tree damage, avoiding moving untreated wood, and choosing native plants to strengthen local ecosystems.\n\n\"By working together, we will have the best chance of limiting the spread of the borer and minimising its impact on our tree canopy and valuable horticulture industries,\" Carbon said.\n\nDo you feel like the air quality is safe where you live?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Doctors in Arkansas are sounding the alarm about a dangerous disease that's becoming an increasing concern in the state.\n\nAccording to 4029 News, doctors are urging caution during the winter months over a surge in cases of Alpha-gal syndrome in Arkansas.\n\nIt is spread by tick bites, and it is best known for its primary symptom of causing a severe allergic reaction to red meat.\n\n\"They'll eat a red meat for dinner, let's say they have a steak for dinner, well, they wake up in the middle of the night with hives, hands swollen, you know, mouth swollen,\" said Daniel Maechler, a nurse practitioner with Mercy Primary Care in Fort Smith.\n\n\"That tends to be the typical presentation that leads us to start working up for Alpha-gal.\"\n\nAlpha-gal requires a blood test to diagnose, as it's a relatively recent addition to the list of maladies afflicting humans.\n\nWhile being allergic to red meat would be a concern for many, the fact that those affected can suddenly develop a potentially life-threatening allergy is a serious problem.\n\nThe reaction could result in fairly mild hives and swelling, but it could also lead to anaphylaxis, which is more concerning.\n\nSince beef stock can be found in a number of foods you might not expect, those afflicted need to be diligent about sticking to the no-red-meat diet to avoid a potentially fatal reaction.\n\nCases of Alpha-gal in the U.S. have previously been seen primarily in the deep South or in the summer months elsewhere in the country, because ticks can't survive the colder winter months.\n\nWhat's the hardest thing about taking care of your yard?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nHowever, as our climate has warmed, the ticks' range has spread, and they've become a more prominent threat to monitor.\n\nUnfortunately, there's not much information available on treatments for Alpha-gal, although red meat should be avoided.\n\n\"This is a kind of a newer diagnosis and kind of newer trend; there are no cures yet,\" Maechler said, \"We just have symptomatic management right now.\"\n\nThe best way to avoid Alpha-gal is to wear long pants, long-sleeved shirts, and safe bug repellent when you're in the woods.\n\nDoing routine tick checks after any hike can help catch them before they have the chance to infect you.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Nintendo has been known to vigorously defend its interests and intellectual properties in court, and one of its longest-running legal battles may be nearing its conclusion. In 2010, the Japanese video game publisher filed a suit in Germany against BigBen Interactive--the previous incarnation of Nacon--over its third-party Wii Remote controllers. Now, the latest ruling has unequivocally gone in Nintendo's favor.\nAs reported by Games Fray, the Mannheim Regional Court has reaffirmed the ruling that Nintendo is owed damages of over €4 million plus interest. Because Nacon fought the ruling, that interest has increased the total fee to just under €7 million.",

    "description": "In the last year, Ukraine's interceptors have gone from novel technology to being produced in the thousands every month.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's defense ministry said on Thursday that it has been supplying its troops with roughly 950 interceptor drones every day since the beginning of December.\n\nIn its statement, the ministry said these drones were specifically to \"counter enemy Shahed-type UAVs.\"\n\nReaching nearly 1,000 daily delivered interceptors is a significant milestone for the production of such drones, which were largely still in prototyping stages at the start of the year.\n\nThese interceptors are first-person-view drones designed to fly into and destroy enemy aerial systems, typically using explosives or direct impact. A typical interceptor drone flies with four motor-powered propellers, but unlike the usual quadcopters, it is often shaped like a bullet or a rocket.\n\nInitially built to destroy high-flying reconnaissance craft, they've since been evolved by Ukrainians to take down long-range attack drones at a low cost — primarily as a response to Russia launching large waves of Iranian-designed Shaheds this year.\n\n\"These systems strengthen protection against drone terror while preserving resources for intercepting cruise and ballistic missiles,\" Ukraine's defense minister, Denys Shmyhal, said in Thursday's announcement.\n\nThe defense ministry also said it's been working with more than 10 interceptor manufacturers and has placed more orders for next year.\n\nFor Ukraine, interceptors must be fast enough to chase down drones such as the Shahed-136, which flies at a typical speed of 115 mph, while remaining cheap so that Kyiv's troops can sustainably use hundreds of them a day. Russia has recently been attacking with roughly 5,500 Shahed-type drones a month.\n\nSome Ukrainian drone makers have also been attempting to develop interceptors that can catch the Geran-3, the Russian version of the jet-powered Shahed-238, which can reportedly fly at an estimated 230 mph.\n\nUkraine's new production capacity comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in November that his country was producing roughly 600 to 800 interceptors a day, falling short of his initial goal.\n\nIn July, Zelenskyy had set a production target of 1,000 interceptors a day.\n\nUkraine's volunteer movements directly sponsor some interceptor drones for select military units, though their quantity is often limited compared to the scale of what the Ukrainian government provides.\n\nFor example, deliveries of the Wild Hornets' Sting, a $2,500 interceptor, were mostly sponsored this year by the Sternenko Foundation, a local crowdfunding organization.",

    "fullText": "Robert Irwin, 22, says his mom was the reason he and his sister were able to manage the loss of their dad, Steve Irwin.\n\nOn Thursday's episode of \"Not Gonna Lie with Kylie Kelce,\" Irwin, the winner of this year's \"Dancing With the Stars,\" recalled dedicating one of his performances to his mom, Terri Irwin, whom he called \"the guiding force behind everything that we do.\"\n\n\"She's been the glue to hold us together through the most challenging times in our lives, particularly when my dad passed,\" Irwin told podcast host Kylie Kelce.\n\nThe DWTS performance, set to Phil Collins's \"You'll Be in My Heart\" from the \"Tarzan\" soundtrack, was his way of publicly thanking her, he said.\n\n\"It felt like this moment to say thank you to not only my mom, but to all of the single parents of the world, all of the moms out there who I feel like don't always get that recognition and celebration that they deserve,\" Irwin said.\n\nWhile dealing with her grief and raising two young kids, his mother also made sure that the conservation work they were involved in continued, he said.\n\n\"It was my mom and dad creating this legacy. And then when he passed, she was the one person to pick up all the broken pieces and to say, 'I'm going to make sure everything that he lived for continues on,'\" Irwin said.\n\nIrwin was only 2 years old when his father died in 2006, after a stingray barb pierced his chest while he was filming a documentary at the Great Barrier Reef.\n\n\"I feel like my mom showed us the power of unity. When you lose someone very close to you, it really reveals the people around you,\" Irwin said, adding that while some people react really well to loss, others don't as much.\n\n\"We just felt like our tight-knit little family, the three of us — my mom, my sister, and I — we just became this little bubble of love,\" Irwin said.\n\nAt Queensland's Australia Zoo, which his family manages, Irwin says they still feed the same crocodiles his dad once did.\n\n\"I feel the closest to my dad when I'm in there with his crocodiles, and I'm feeding them,\" Irwin added.\n\nDuring the DWTS episode in which he dedicated his performance to his mom, Irwin said that as he grew older, he realized just how hard things must have been for her.\n\n\"I've never been able to capture the feeling of gratitude that I feel for her. At every milestone, I just wished that my dad was there. She was there, and that was enough,\" Irwin said.\n\nIn a September interview with People, Irwin said he feels closer to his late father than ever, partly because there's so much footage of him from his television show, \"The Crocodile Hunter,\" which aired from 1997 to 2004.\n\n\"I'll often come across archive footage that I haven't seen before,\" Irwin said. \"And all of a sudden, his memory just starts flooding back. So it's weird that decades later, after losing someone when I was 2 years old, I almost have an even greater picture of the person he was.\"",

    "fullText": "\"Code red\" isn't a one-off at OpenAI.\n\nCEO Sam Altman said on an episode of the \"Big Technology Podcast\" published Thursday that the company has entered emergency mode multiple times in response to competitive threats — and expects to continue doing so as rivals close in.\n\n\"It's good to be paranoid and act quickly when a potential competitive threat emerges,\" Altman said.\n\n\"My guess is we'll be doing these once maybe twice a year for a long time, and that's part of really just making sure that we win in our space,\" he added.\n\nAltman said that OpenAI had gone \"code red\" earlier this year when China's DeepSeek emerged. DeepSeek shocked the tech industry in January when it said its AI model matches top competitors like ChatGPT's o1 at a fraction of the cost.\n\nOpenAI entered \"code red\" earlier this month, about two weeks after Google released its latest AI chatbot, Gemini 3. The model drew widespread praise after its release in November, with Google touting it as its most advanced model to date. Altman reportedly told staff in an internal Slack memo that OpenAI would prioritize ChatGPT while pushing back other product plans.\n\nAltman said in the podcast episode that Google's Gemini 3 did not have \"the impact we were worried it might.\"\n\n\"But it did — in the same way that Deepseek did — identify some weaknesses in our product offering strategy, and we're addressing those very quickly,\" he added.\n\nSince OpenAI entered \"code red,\" the company has moved quickly to ship new upgrades and features.\n\nLast week, it rolled out a more advanced AI model aimed at improving ChatGPT's performance across professional work, coding, and scientific tasks. OpenAI also unveiled a new image-generation model earlier this week.\n\nAltman said the company will not be in code red \"that much longer.\"\n\n\"Historically, these have been kind of like six- or eight-week things for us,\" he added.\n\nThe state of \"code red\" has also been a precedent for other tech companies. In 2022, Google declared an internal \"code red\" after ChatGPT's debut. The search giant was lagging in consumer AI, despite having funded much of the research that made the AI boom possible.",

    "title": "Jake Paul vs. Anthony Joshua unsurprisingly tops our list of 5 things in boxing this weekend",
    "description": "Love it or loathe it, there’s no escaping it — Jake Paul vs. Anthony Joshua is Friday night in Miami.",
    "fullText": "This weekend of action needs no introduction.\n\nLove it or loathe it, there’s no escaping it — Jake Paul vs. Anthony Joshua is Friday night in Miami, and the noise around it has been impossible to ignore.\n\nAfter five years of boxing in relatively controlled environments, Paul finally steps into a bout that offers no safety net, no asterisks and no soft landing. This is his chance to silence the skeptics and show that he belongs in the sport as more than just a novelty act chasing headlines.\n\nFor Joshua, the responsibility — and the opportunity — sits squarely in his fists. One emphatic statement against the YouTuber-turned-boxer would not only bring the Paul experiment to a crashing halt, but also send “AJ” into 2026 with momentum, relevance and the attention of a U.S. audience suddenly invested in the next chapter of his career.\n\nBut that’s not all that’s happening …\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the five biggest things to look out for this weekend in the world of boxing:\n\nIt feels less like a question of \"if\" and more of a matter of when Paul will get flattened Friday night — and that view isn’t rooted in any lack of respect.\n\nI’ve long since run out of ways to dress up how brave Paul is for taking this fight, but bravery has a habit of bleeding into recklessness when the gap is this vast. There’s a thin line between the two, and Paul is straddling it.\n\nJoshua is levels above him in every conceivable department, several rungs higher on every ladder you care to climb. I don’t doubt for a second that AJ stops Paul on Friday, but there’s just enough curiosity in the chaos to make it unmissable as a spectacle.\n\nStrip it back and it’s boxing in its rawest form. “Step right up, place your bets, and see how long the smaller novice can survive with a seasoned professional before getting knocked out.”\n\nAfter a brief spell of sizing his man up, it will last precisely as long as Joshua decides it should — and you can take that to the bank.\n\nThere’s every chance this is just another colossal marketing exercise from Jake Paul — albeit one that could come with a very real physical cost.\n\nEven if Paul ends the night face down and unconscious, he still gets to walk away claiming he had the nerve to share a ring with an athlete as big, powerful and proven as Anthony Joshua.\n\nThe sheer number of eyes that will land on this Netflix card only drags Most Valuable Promotions further into the mainstream, and the inevitable memes that follow will do nothing but extend Paul’s reach globally in a sport he appears genuinely invested in.\n\nAnd it’s worth remembering: He’s rebuilt before. After losing to Tommy Fury in 2023, he somehow found himself back in the spotlight mixing it up with — checks notes — Mike Tyson.\n\nWins don’t always end with your hand raised, and Paul might just be playing the long game.\n\nJust over a week ago, WBC lightweight champion Caroline Dubois was still in kind of a career limbo.\n\nThe 24-year-old had turned down two offers from Most Valuable Promotions in an attempt to lure her away from Boxxer and had nothing lineup up in terms of action.\n\nBut a week in boxing can change a lot. Finally agreeing to terms on the third offer — joining a host of female talent, including world champions Ellie Scotney and Alycia Baumgardner — and Dubois is now an MVP fighter, and even better, has been thrown onto the undercard in Miami on Friday night.\n\nDubois defends her WBC title at 135 pounds against Italy’s Camilla Panatta in what is expected to be a routine victory, before moving into a busy 2026 where the hit list is plentiful for “Sweet” Caroline.\n\nDubois has grown rapidly in ability and confidence over the past 18 months, and she’s targeting Baumgardner and fellow Brit Terri Harper next year in an attempt to follow in her big brother’s successful footsteps of headlining major cards.\n\nAfter making his return to the ring in August following a 26-year absence, Ike “The President” Ibeabuchi is back (again) on Christmas Eve (obviously) fighting 45-year-old Kabiru Towolawi.\n\nHeadlining a fight card called “Redemption” in Lagos, Nigeria, Ibeabuchi continues his quest to become world heavyweight champion at 52.\n\nThe card will be streamed on prizefighting.tv, and there is a heavy lean on the narrative that Ibeabuchi is en route to bigger and better things in the sport, specifically breaking then-45-year-old George Foreman's record as the oldest heavyweight champion.\n\nIf delusion is your cup of tea, then check out the press release championing Ibeabuchi’s second coming:\n\n“If Ike can dismantle a tough, active opponent like Kabiru, the comeback is no longer a 'story' — it is a reality. The fact that he has maintained his physique and his focus for nearly three decades should strike fear into the hearts of current champions. He isn't just fighting for a paycheck; he is fighting for a miracle.”\n\nSpeaking of Africa, Matchroom is in Ghana on Saturday night to promote itrs first show on the African continent.\n\nBritish light heavyweights Craig Richards and Dan Azeez headline a bill inside Accra's Legon Sports Stadium in a real crossroads fight between two extremely likable fighters.\n\nA loss for either Richards (35) or Azeez (36) would surely push him close to the exit door of a sport that has provided them both with the esteemed British title and numerous nights of domestic barnburners.\n\nBut for the winner? A big night in the opposite corner to rising Ben Whittaker could be the prize on offer.",

    "description": "WWE star GUNTHER explains the differences between his retirement matches with John Cena and Goldberg.",
    "fullText": "After two major wins this year, GUNTHER now has the unique distinction of retiring John Cena and Goldberg, both of whom are considered legends within WWE. Outside of their high-profile status in WWE, though, \"The Ring General\" indicates that Cena and Goldberg vastly differ. During a new interview with TMZ's \"Inside The Ring,\" he explained how.\n\n\"Very different situation I think because Goldberg was also way more limited than John was. John was just a better wrestler over all his whole career. It's not like it dig to Goldberg. He didn't get famous by putting on in-ring master classes. That was never his thing, so it was a very different situation,\" GUNTHER said when asked to contrast his encounters with Cena and Goldberg.\n\n\"Also the magnitude of it. Obviously, Goldberg is a big name, but it's not comparable to what John Cena represents or the following he has, what he carries with him, and the connection that people have to him. It was hard to compare.\"\n\nGUNTHER's faceoff with Goldberg came at WWE Saturday Night's Main Event on July 12, which ended with the latter passing out to the former's sleeper hold. At SNME on December 13, GUNTHER again emerged victorious with his sleeper hold, this time by making Cena, a conduit of perseverance, tap out.\n\nFollowing their retirement matches, Goldberg and Cena have officially hung up their wrestling boots, or sneakers in Cena's case, at the ages of 58 and 48, respectively. Cena remains a part of the WWE family through his role as an ambassador.\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"Inside The Ring\" with a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "No matter what happens this weekend, Mainz will spend the winter break at the bottom of the Bundesliga table. Despite that hard fact, the Rheinhessen will at least have European football to offer their fans in the coming 2026 calendar year. Heading into the Bundesliga’s 15th matchday, Mainz have still only won one solitary league fixture. In Europe, they’ve been a different beast.\n\nThursday night’s 2-0 home win over Samsunspor gave Mainz four wins in the Conference League this autumn. With the 2025/26 UEFA Europa Conference League group phase now complete, Mainz have finished 7th place in the table and will not have to contest the February playoff round. Come March, the Palatinate club will compete in the Round-of-16 phase of the competition.\n\nOnce again, the team was able to deliver its  fans a magical European evening.\n\nAfter the full time whistle, newly appointed FSV head coach Urs Fischer spoke of a “trying match that featured lots of suffering” when speaking to German broadcaster RTL. Mainz’s de-facto leader on the pitch – tapped by Fischer to serve up higher than usual in the No. 10 slot – didn’t exactly feel the same way. Nadiem Amiri led the FSV cheers in his usual trademark fashion.\n\n“It was very important for me to come out and perform like this again today,” Amiri told RTL. “To finally feel fit and free. It’s a huge step for the club and for us [as a team] a small set in the right direction.“\n\nAmiri’s sunk the crucial 2-0 from the penalty spot shortly after the restart. The latest conversion makes it seven straight penalties for the club’s designated taker. The 29-year-old’s interviewer naturally wished to know if he modeled himself after Bundesliga record breaker Harry Kane.\n\n“Harry Kane is on a totally different level than me,” Amiri answered. “But he’s definitely a role model from whom I learn. I think I’m good at taking penalties, but I have to keep it up.“\n\n“I think today was by far our best performance of the season,” Amiri assured his interviewer. “We were organized on the ball and against the ball. sensational. We can build on this performance.“",

    "title": "Kyle Whittingham on why now was the right time to step down and his post-Utah future",
    "description": "In first interview with the media since stepping down as Utah’s head coach, Whittingham spoke about his decision and what the future holds",
    "fullText": "In his first interview with the media since stepping down as Utah’s head coach last Friday, Kyle Whittingham addressed why now was the right time for him to walk away from the program he’s been in charge of for the past 21 seasons.\n\n“Well, the program’s in a good place right now,” he said after practice Thursday. “As I’ve said many times after last season, it just didn’t sit right with anybody, particularly me, and so came back and fortunately we were able to get the ship righted and everything’s on track.\n\n“Program, like I said, is in a good spot. Got good coaches, coach (Morgan) Scalley will come in and do a great job, got good players, so now is the time.”\n\nWhittingham will coach his final game for Utah in the Dec. 31 Las Vegas Bowl vs. Nebraska.\n\n“This team has been one of my favorite years. The team attitude, the leadership, the work ethic, just the personality and the feel, the vibe of the team is outstanding and having the chance to be around these guys one more month and go to battle one more time with them is something I wanted to do,” Whittingham said.\n\nThe future for Whittingham after he finishes his 266th game as head coach of the Utes is still up in the air. The language used in last Friday’s announcement was “stepping down,” not “retiring,” and moments after the decision was announced, multiple national reporters, including The Athletic’s Stewart Mandel, reported that Whittingham could pursue other coaching opportunities.\n\n“Whittingham, 66, is not retiring, according to a source close to the coach, and may pursue other coaching opportunities,” Mandel wrote on X.\n\nPer’s Whittingham’s latest contract with Utah, he would serve as a “Special Assistant to the Athletics Director” for two years following retirement. That position would pay him $3.45 million per year and Whittingham would not be required to provide more than 10 hours of consulting in a week.\n\nBut is Whittingham’s desire to coach “out of his system” and is he ready to step away from the sidelines completely?\n\n“I don’t know if it’s ever out of your system. I mean it’s in your blood and so I don’t know about that,” he said. “That being said, I’m not sure what I’m going to do, but when you got the coaching in your blood, it just doesn’t go away.”\n\nAsked if this was not a retirement, Whittingham responded, “Who knows? We’ll see. I’m just stepping down and step away and reevaluate things.”\n\nAs for what the process of deciding whether to pursue other opportunities or move into his special assistant role at Utah looks like, it’s pretty simple for Whittingham.\n\n“If my phone rings, I answer it, I like who’s calling? Then we’ll see. Yeah, that’s pretty much the process,” Whittingham said.\n\nUltimately, Whittingham’s decision to step down seemed to come down to his feeling that now was the right time to transition the program over to Scalley.\n\nAdditionally, Whittingham said multiple times on Thursday that he didn’t want to “overstay his welcome” after 21 years in charge of the program.\n\n“I’m a free agent. I’m in the transfer portal,” Whittingham said to laughs. “So yeah, it’s a different feel, but like I said, I’m at peace and I did not want to be that guy that overstayed his welcome and people just saying, ‘Hey, when’s this guy going to leave?’\n\n“That was not my intention ever and I hope I didn’t do that. I’m sure with some people I did do that, but to me the timing is right.”\n\nIt’s still Whittingham’s team until after the Las Vegas Bowl. Aside from the players who have entered the transfer portal, Whittingham said Thursday that Utah has just three opt-outs so far for the New Year’s Eve bowl game — offensive tackle Spencer Fano, offensive tackle Caleb Lomu and defensive end Logan Fano, all of whom have declared for the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nOther than that, Whittingham is expecting everyone, including quarterback Devon Dampier, to play in the Las Vegas Bowl.\n\n“As far as not playing in the game, I think that what we have right now is what we’re going to the game with. I hope so,” Whittingham said.\n\nUtah, favored by 16.5 points against a Nebraska team that will be missing its starting quarterback and running back, has plenty of motivation to send Whittingham out with his 178th win at Utah.\n\n“It means a lot to me. … That’s a coach that believed in me to come in here after being at New Mexico and just had full trust in me and the offense to do what we do and that’s just huge respect from him and just what he’s done for this program,” Dampier said.\n\n“I got to finish well for him.”\n\nWhile Whittingham’s post-Utah future is still unclear as of this week, the program’s future is Scalley, who was announced as Utah’s next head coach last Saturday.\n\nWhittingham gave his full endorsement to Scalley, who played at Utah and coached for nearly two decades under Whittingham and now will lead the Utes starting in the 2026 season.\n\n“He’s organized. He’s really good with Xs and Os. He’s really good at connecting with players. His culture ideas, my culture ideas align perfectly. We both have a lot of the same recruiting strategies and thoughts, evaluation-wise, how you navigate the portal, all that stuff,” Whittingham said.\n\n“It’s very consistent and I think that there’s going to be far more similarities than change. Now he’ll put his own stamp on the program and make no mistake, but way back when I took over for Urban (Meyer) if it’s not broke, don’t fix it. We hung on to a lot of the stuff that Urban did here, but (Scalley) has been here a lot of years. He’s a Utah Man through and through, and so I think it’s going to be a good situation.”\n\nScalley is in the process of building his staff right now and he will be introduced as Utah’s head coach in a press conference on Jan. 6.",

    "title": "NFL Predictions: 3 Plus Money Bets to Target for Week 16",
    "description": "Targeting value in Week 16 NFL betting? We break down three plus-money predictions worth backing, with matchup analysis, betting angles, and odds insight.",
    "fullText": "Plus-money props are where opportunity meets context, and this week offers plenty of both.\n\nA rookie quarterback heading on the road is being undervalued by the market, while two proven veterans are playing with real money on the line as contract incentives come into focus.\n\nMotivation, matchup, and usage all align to create outsized NFL picks at longer odds.\n\nSince returning to the lineup, J.J. McCarthy looks rejuvenated, throwing five touchdown passes against vulnerable Washington and Dallas defenses. The Giants profile similarly when it comes to stopping offenses near the goal line, making this another spot where efficiency should show up on the scoreboard.\n\nNew York ranks bottom five in red-zone defense and is riding an eight-game losing skid, allowing 31.5 points per game. This is a defense that struggles to stop drives, and the Minnesota Vikings are well-positioned to take advantage. McCarthy has also shown he’s not afraid to push the ball downfield, ranking second in air yards per attempt while benefiting from the second-best protection rate in the league at 88 percent.\n\nMinnesota’s red-zone tendencies further support the Over. The Vikings have been ineffective running the ball near the goal line to the point that C.J. Ham handled the short-yardage touchdown last week. As a result, Minnesota ranks among the most pass-heavy teams in the red zone. All signs point toward McCarthy clearing 1.5 passing touchdowns.\n\nStefon Diggs has incentive money firmly in play with three games remaining. He’s three receptions shy of a $500K bonus, and 13 catches away from another $500K, putting a total of $1 million on the line. Diggs has recorded at least three receptions in all but one game this season, but has been quieter recently in a pair of run-heavy matchups against the Bills and Giants.\n\nThat could change this week against Baltimore, a defense allowing the sixth-most receptions to wide receivers. If Diggs wants to make a real push toward that second incentive at 80 catches, the volume needs to start building now. With the Jets up next and a Week 18 matchup against Miami that could turn run-heavy if playoff positioning is settled, this sets up as a spot where Diggs is motivated, and the matchup finally cooperates.\n\nFollow me here, because this angle makes sense. Nick Folk has been one of the most reliable kickers in the league, converting 96.2 percent of his attempts, the best mark in the NFL. This also happens to be his final indoor game of the season before trips to the Meadowlands and Orchard Park in Weeks 17 and 18, where kicking conditions become far less predictable.\n\nFolk sits at 25 made field goals and has significant incentives in play, earning $375K at 27 makes and another $500K if he reaches 30. He kicks for an offense that struggles to finish drives and draws another favorable matchup against the Saints this week. Indoors, the leash is longer, and there’s a real chance the coaching staff is more aggressive with long attempts than they’d consider outdoors. Folk has missed just one kick all season and is 7-for-8 from 50-plus, which could turn a few borderline decisions into field goal tries with real incentive-driven upside.\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "description": "Joe Buck will be part of ESPN’s first game lineup to call the Los Angeles Dodgers vs. New York Mets game.",
    "fullText": "Joe Buck will be part of ESPN’s first game lineup to call the Los Angeles Dodgers vs. New York Mets game on April 15, as he announced on SI Media with Jimmy Traina. This marks Buck’s second consecutive year being part of ESPN’s first broadcast.\n\nDespite ESPN and Major League Baseball reaching a deal to air 30 regular-season games, Buck is only scheduled to call the Dodgers-Mets game. Last season marked the first time Buck called a nationally broadcasted baseball game since 2021, after leaving Fox for ESPN.\n\nIn 2022, Buck and Troy Aikman signed a multiyear deal with ESPN to become the voices of Monday Night Football. Despite shifting his focus mostly to the NFL, Buck returned for an MLB game alongside Chip Caray in the St. Louis Cardinals' booth in 2024.\n\nBuck and Caray also have fathers who were sports broadcasters. Joe Buck worked alongside his father, Jack, as a Cardinals radio and television broadcaster from 1991 to 2007.\n\nHe also called the PGA Tournament and hosted an alternate broadcast in 2022. The 56-year-old broadcaster prefers calling baseball games earlier in the season because he feels more prepared.\n\n“For someone who hasn’t been involved in the game for four years, and I did Opening Day last year, I think it’s easier to launch off the beginning of the season because it’s not looking back,” Buck told Traina.\n\nBuck also believes calling a game featuring the back-to-back World Series champions will make his job easier.\n\n“It’s a Dodger game, I think it’s Dodger-Mets so, there’s a lot to talk about. I mean, I could probably do it right now. The Dodgers, half their lineup’s going to end up in the Hall of Fame. They’re easy names.”\n\nWhile Buck didn’t officially rule out calling a game later in the season or during the playoffs, he acknowledged it would be much more challenging.\n\n“I’m not prepared to do that without putting myself in solitary confinement for a month and trying to catch up with everything that’s gone on,” Buck said.\n\nBefore Buck’s four-year absence from baseball, he was one of the most recognizable voices in the sport. He served as Fox’s lead play-by-play announcer from 1996 to 2021. During that time, Buck called 23 World Series and 21 All-Star Games, the most by any play-by-play announcer on network television.\n\nBuck will receive the 2026 Ford C. Frick Award, which is presented annually to a broadcaster for major contributions to baseball. Buck and his father will become the first father-son duo to receive the award.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams will need to be at their best Thursday night to pick up a huge NFC West Division win against the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nBut they'll have to do that without Davante Adams.\n\nThe superstar wide receiver is on the sideline, not on the field, leaving Matthew Stafford to rely on Puka Nacua and a bunch of down-the-depth-chart WRs beyond him.\n\nThe Rams are slight underdogs, likely in part due to Adams' absence. But with Stafford, they still have a great chance.\n\nMORE: ACL recovery timeline impacts when Patrick Mahomes, Micah Parsons will return\n\nDavante Adams is out Thursday night against the Seahawks due to injury.\n\nAdams was listed as doubtful for the game originally, both with knee and hamstring issues, and didn't practice all week.\n\nHe has been fantastic for the Rams this season, catching 60 passes for 789 yards and 14 touchdowns.\n\nMORE: Bills may not win the AFC East — but they sent a clear warning to the rest of the NFL\n\nWithout Adams, the depth chart is a bit unclear. Konata Mumpfield saw the third-most snaps a week ago. The Rams also have Tutu Atwell, Jordan Whittington and Xavier Smith, in addition to a full tight end assortment to choose from.\n\nThe Rams will get the helpful \"mini-bye\" after this that should allow Adams to recover and make it back out on the field sooner rather than later.\n\nJaxson Dart has a 50% head injury problem\n\nTrevor Lawrence had a game never before done by an NFL quarterback\n\nThe Packers had a chance to sign an all-time great for $5 million and passed\n\nTua Tagovailoa's contract looks like a nightmare\n\nPatrick Mahomes' injury has fans asking Tom Brady ACL question\n\nThis Mike Tomlin horrible streak is hard to believe",

    "fullText": "The Detroit Tigers continued to add pitching depth to the organization, signing right-hander Inohan Paniagua and left-hander Enmanuel De Jesus to minor league contracts, re-signing left-handers Sean Guenther and Carlos Peña, and extending a non-roster invitation to De Jesus for spring training.\n\nPaniagua, 23, is a power right-hander who bolsters Detroit’s lower-level pitching depth. Signed out of the Dominican Republic, he has spent much of his professional career developing as a starter. His fastball reaches the mid-90s, and the Tigers will continue to evaluate his secondary offerings as they determine whether his future is best suited for the rotation or a relief role as he advances through the system.\n\nDe Jesus, 27, adds experienced left-handed depth and versatility. The Venezuelan native has pitched at the Triple-A level and has worked both as a starter and reliever, giving Detroit a flexible option capable of covering multiple innings. While he has yet to establish himself at the major league level, De Jesus has shown an ability to generate swings and misses and will get an extended look in big league camp as a non-roster invitee.\n\nGuenther, 28, returns on a minor league deal after spending last season in the Tigers’ system. A former Rule 5 pick by Miami, Guenther has big league experience and has primarily worked out of the bullpen. He relies on a fastball-slider combination and provides additional left-handed relief depth at the upper levels of the organization.\n\nPeña also returns to the Tigers after previously pitching in the system. The left-hander adds further organizational depth and familiarity with Detroit’s player development staff. While he is expected to open the season in the minors, Peña gives the Tigers another experienced arm as they build out their pitching inventory.\n\nThe moves underscore Detroit’s emphasis on pitching depth across all levels of the organization. None of the signings are expected to immediately impact the major league roster, but they provide the Tigers with added flexibility entering spring training and the 2026 season.\n\nFollow me on \"X\" @rogcastbaseball",

    "fullText": "The Baltimore Ravens got star quarterback Lamar Jackson back at practice on Thursday, but three players were listed with new injuries.\n\nJackson has been getting consistent rest on Wednesdays, and a minor illness was even more reason to keep him at home. He returned to practice as a full participant and will likely be off the injury report altogether by the end of the week.\n\nWide receiver Zay Flowers, center Tyler Linderbaum, and John Jenkins were all added to the injury report on Thursday. Flowers has a neck injury, which is always cause for concern, though it did not stop him from practicing in full. Linderbaum was limited by a knee injury, while Jenkins was absent due to an illness.\n\nAbsences from Flowers and Linderbaum would be huge losses for the Ravens offense, especially heading into a matchup with the Patriots’ top-10 defense. Both will be important to monitor on Friday’s injury report.\n\nHere is the Ravens’ full Thursday injury report (* denotes change in status):\n\nLB Jay Higgins (knee, designated to return from injured reserve)\n\nLT Ronnie Stanley (knee/ankle) *\n\nThe Ravens have not yet placed Buchanan on injured reserve. That move should come later in the week; the team may be waiting to see if Higgins is ready to be activated from his own IR stint. The undrafted rookie is in the first week of his 21-day return window and may need some more time to ramp up.\n\nAn absence from Awuzie is a real possibility after two straight missed practices, which would put T.J. Tampa in a bigger role. The second-year cornerback has held up when asked to play this year, though he has only seen extended time in two games.\n\nHarbaugh said that veterans like Stanley, Smith, and presumably Van Noy were dealing with the typical late-season wear-and-tear and needed some extra rest on Wednesday. The returns of all three on Thursday bodes well for their availability this weekend.\n\nBateman is on track to return from his one-game absence, while Keondre Jackson and Okoye are unlikely to miss any time at all.\n\nThe Patriots’ injury report featured upgraded statuses for two players. Defensive tackle Christian Barmore (non-injury related/other) and linebacker Christian Elliss (illness) both returned to practice after missing Wednesday’s session. Cornerbacks Carlton Davis (hip) and Marcus Jones (knee) and linebackers Harold Landry (knee) and Robert Spillane (ankle) all logged their second absences in a row. All four starters could miss Sunday’s matchup in Baltimore, which would be a major boost to an offense that has struggled against elite defenses this year.",

    "fullText": "When the Golden State Warriors return to the court on Thursday night, they will be without a pair of key rotational pieces against the Phoenix Suns. The Warriors will be missing veteran big man Al Horford and guard Pat Spencer on Thursday night in Phoenix.\n\nHorford has been missing time with a sciatica injury. Horford has missed seven of the last eight games, including four straight. Thursday night will be his fifth straight missed game. ESPN's Nick Friedell reports that Horford is still around another week away from returning from to the court as he continues to rehab from his sciatica injury.\n\nHorford said he is feeling better in his rehab — but he thinks he’s probably another week away from returning as he continues to deal with a sciatica issue.\n\n— Nick Friedell (@NickFriedell) December 18, 2025\n\nHorford has played 13 games in his first season for the Warriors, averaging 5.6 points on 32.1% shooting from the field and 29.8% from deep to go along with 4.4 rebounds per contest.\n\nWhile Horford is out on Thursday with his sciatica injury, Spencer is ruled out against the Suns for personal reasons. With Spencer and Horford out, Steve Kerr will have to lean on Golden State's depth, with players like Quinten Post, Brandin Podziemski, De'Anthony Melton and Gary Payton II potentially seeing a bigger role on Thursday night in Phoenix.\n\nThe Warriors will tip off against the Suns at 6 p.m. PT on Thursday night in the desert.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Warriors Wire! \n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Injury Report: Al Horford, Pat Spencer out vs. Suns",

The immediate future has the Buffalo Bills coming to town looking to build their playoff resume, while Browns fans hope for 2026 NFL draft positioning and another chance for QB Shedeur Sanders to prove something.\n\nThe first injury report of the week was loaded with players sitting out, a majority on the home team’s side.

He’s good on the edge. He’s fast. He’s played inside a little bit. He’s played on the edge.”\n\nGainer recorded 27 tackles and 2.5 sacks in his one season at UNC. He finished his college career with 237 total tackles.\n\n“He played inside at Florida State, if I remember, in college,” Maye said. “He moved to the edge once he got to North Carolina. So, I know he was with Vegas, and it’s good to see him back. I think everybody’s just trying to see what they can do just to help us, whether it’s on game day, throughout practice or whatever he can do.”\n\nGainer appeared in 17 games as a rookie with the Las Vegas Raiders, playing mostly in a special teams capacity. The 25-year-old provides good size to the practice squad and a great motor, according to Maye.\n\n“I know he’s going to work hard, and I know he’s got a good work ethic,” Maye said.\n\nMike Vrabel-Bashing Radio Host Shreds Patriots Coach Amid Josh McDaniels Debate",

The deal reportedly contains $40 million in guaranteed money.\n\nThe 29-year-old was originally slated to hit free agency after this season, which he began as a member of the Las Vegas Raiders. He had asked for a trade from the team during the offseason and finally got one to Jacksonville at the trade deadline.\n\nThe Jaguars gave up fourth- and sixth-round picks for Meyers and got a reliable receiver. Meyers posted his first career 1,000-receiving yard season last year in Vegas and has followed it up with 707 yards this season, 355 of them in six games with the Jaguars. His tenure in Jacksonville has also coincided with a 5-1 run for the team, which leads the AFC South with a 10-4 record.\n\nA $20 million average annual value places Meyers 25th among current wide receiver contracts via OverTheCap, right behind Tampa Bay Buccaneers star Mike Evans.",

    "fullText": "Tennessee radio personality Jared Stillman has become a notorious critic of New England Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel.\n\nThe Nashville-based host blasted Vrabel earlier this season when he claimed the team’s 8-2 start should be credited to the addition of offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, not the head coaching change.\n\nNow he is back at it, this time claiming Vrabel is “itching” to get rid of McDaniels so that he can hire one of his previous coordinators.\n\n“I know Vrabel-ese, and I know Mike Vrabel,” Stillman said. “I assume that Mike Vrabel is just itching to get Josh McDaniels out of there so that he can hire one of his loser buddies like Todd Downing or Tim Kelly. I can feel it!\n\n“And you can call me a hater or whatever you want to call me, I can just sense it.”\n\nStillman went on to say that the only thing keeping the Patriots from winning a Super Bowl in the near future is Vrabel’s ego.\n\n“The only thing in my opinion that’s going to keep Mike Vrabel, and Drake Maye, and Josh McDaniels, from winning the Super Bowl at some point over the next five years, is Mike Vrabel’s ego,” Stillman said. “And Josh McDaniels is the epitome of the downside of the great Mike Vrabel.”\n\nStillman’s criticism centered on a moment when Vrabel was asked about McDaniels’ success as a play caller, and he answered with praise for the entire coaching staff.\n\nThat is a bad thing in Stillman’s eyes.\n\nThe self-proclaimed hater likened Vrabel’s answer to a moment when he was coaching the Tennessee Titans and was asked about the then-quarterback Wil Levis’ performance. Vrabel once again praised the entire staff, as opposed to just crediting the individual.\n\nWhich, again, apparently is a bad thing.\n\n“Josh McDaniels is a Super Bowl-winning offensive coordinator who got Mac Jones to the Pro Bowl as a rookie,” Stillman said. “And they have the 23-year-old second coming of Aaron Rodgers without the baggage and drama at quarterback. And Vrabel can’t be happy?”\n\nDrake Maye Raves About Former North Carolina Teammate After Patriots Signing",

    "description": "In the suit, McPhee says she was placed on leave to stop her from testifying before a federal grand injury investigating the NFLPA and the Major League Baseball Players Association, according to ESPN's report.",
    "fullText": "Heather McPhee, associate general counsel for the NFL Players Association since 2009, filed a federal lawsuit Thursday, alleging that former executive director Lloyd Howell Jr. and two current top union executives conspired to prevent her from cooperating with a criminal investigation into union finances, as reported by ESPN's Don Van Natta Jr.\n\nMcPhee was placed on paid administrative leave on Aug. 14 after she was the subject of multiple employee complaints, per Van Natta and ESPN's Jeff Passan, that reportedly included accusations of failing to follow supervisors' directions, bullying colleagues and disrupting the union's work environment.\n\nIn the suit, McPhee says she was placed on leave to stop her from testifying before a federal grand injury investigating the NFLPA and the Major League Baseball Players Association, according to ESPN's report.\n\nMonths before she was placed on leave, she made allegations that sparked an FBI investigation into the NFLPA, the MLBPA and OneTeam Partners, their $2 billion licensing company.\n\nMcPhee is reportedly seeking at least $10 million in damages, according to the suit, in which she accuses Howell of illegal misconduct, sex discrimination, breach of fiduciary duty and retaliation, per ESPN.\n\nHowell, who became the NFLPA's executive director in 2022, resigned on July 17. He stepped down after a tumultuous month of criticism that stemmed from Pablo Torre and Mike Florio reporting that the NFL and NFLPA covered up a ruling on a collusion grievance. An arbitrator, Christopher Droney, found that, in the wake of Deshaun Watson signing a fully-guaranteed $230 million contract with the Cleveland Browns ahead of the 2022 season, league executives encouraged team owners to reduce the amount of guaranteed money players received in subsequent contracts.\n\nDroney, though, concluded that he couldn't prove by a \"clear preponderance\" that NFL teams followed suit. Still, the details revealed from that 2022 annual owners' meeting were indelible, and so was the fact that the NFLPA reportedly agreed with the NFL to keep the collusion grievance findings under wraps. That left a stain on Howell's reputation, as did other matters, chief among them his reported spending of union funds for visits to strip clubs.\n\nAfter McPhee initially flagged concerns within the NFLPA in November 2024 regarding senior executives potentially violating labor laws governing conflicts of interest and the fulfillment of fiduciary duties, as reported by ESPN, she alleges that union leaders targeted her \"in order to conceal and deflect their own misconduct and failures.\"\n\nMcPhee questioned the legality of a senior executive incentive plan proposed by OneTeam Partners that would have paid millions of dollars in bonuses to Howell, MLBPA executive director Tony Clark and others, per ESPN, which also reported that McPhee states in the suit that she opposed Howell's decision to keep the collusion grievance findings secret.\n\nThe suit says, according to ESPN, that the union leaders signing a confidentiality agreement with the NFL \"raised concerns about a potential violation of the NFLPA's duty of fair representation to players.\"\n\nWhen union leaders discovered McPhee was in line to testify as a grand jury witness about what she deemed to be criminal misconduct by Howell and others, she alleges she was removed from meetings and cut off from the board and players.\n\nShe was then placed on leave due to her \"workplace behavior.\" McPhee believes that was a tactic to prevent her from cooperating with the DOJ.",

    "description": "Rutgers Wrestling falls against a ranked Oklahoma team, picks up win over Drexel.",
    "fullText": "The Rutgers wrestling team split its weekend matches, falling to then-No. 20 Oklahoma 19-14 but beating unranked Drexel 28-12. Oklahoma’s win saw them jump up into the No.15 spot according to the NWCA Coaches Poll. The Scarlet Knights were ranked at No.12 before moving down to No.19.\n\nDespite the result, Rutgers got off to a really hot start in their dual against Oklahoma. The Knights took home four victories in the first six bouts and built an 11-6 lead heading into the final four. This run was highlighted by a No. 13/9 Dylan Shawver major decision over Carter Schmidt,13-3, and a No. 26/28 Anthony White Major decision over Layton Schneider, 8-0. Unfortunately for the Knights, their run would stop here. Rutgers was beaten in four straight bouts, allowing Oklahoma to secure victory. Both 174-pounder No. 9/4 Lenny Pinto and HWT No.22/19 Hunter Catka fought their opponent tough, but neither could find a way to pull off a victory against their ranked opponents.\n\nFormer Knight and 184-pounder No.11 Brian Soldano found his way back to the banks for this match after becoming a Sooner. He delivered Oklahoma a 9-6 decision over No. 15/18 Shane Cartagena-Walsh.\n\nThe heavier weights for Rutgers, who struggled against Oklahoma, fared much better against Drexel. The Knights finished the duel with five straight wins and seven wins overall. This streak was highlighted by Pinto securing a fall over No.18/13 Jesiah Queen, Cartagena-Walsh securing a major decision over Ethan Wilson, 18/16 197-pounder Remy Cotton securing a major decision over No.31 Ibrahim Ameer, and Catka securing a tech fall over Dom Petracci to cement Rutgers 16 point win.\n\nThe season as a whole started strong for Rutgers. The Knights started 5-0 in the duals, cruising over schools like Centenary, Gardner-Webb, Bloomsburg, Navy, and Davidson. The team also took home first place in the Keystone Classic, where Pinto, 141-pounder Joseph Olivieri, and 125-pounder Ayden Smith brought home individual titles for their weight class. Rutgers would finish the tournament with 159 team points. The next highest was Penn at 140 team points.\n\nHowever, once Rutgers played No.10 NC State and No.20 Oklahoma, they struggled, dropping both duals in tough fashion. Despite their win over unranked Drexel, things will only get harder for the Knights from here, as their next dual is a date with No.1 Penn State in Happy Valley to kick off conference play, one week before No.13 Michigan comes to town. The Big Ten is widely regarded as the best conference in wrestling, so Rutgers will have to step up and win some ranked duals to show that it still deserves to be a ranked program itself.\n\nThe first bout for the Knights in their match at Penn State will be at 4 pm on January 10th.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams will be without wide receiver Davante Adams for the Week 16 game against the Seattle Seahawks, which will have huge playoff implications.\n\nAdams landed on the injury report once again this week with a hamstring issue. He was on the Week 15 injury report with the hamstring, also, but aggravated the issue and was forced to exit last week's game early.\n\nAdams didn't practice at all this week before drawing the doubtful tag and being ruled out on Thursday night ahead of kickoff.\n\nHere's what we know about his return timeline.\n\nAt this point, Adams should be considered week to week.\n\nAdams' injury isn't a season-ending issue, so he will be back at some point. When that is, remains to be seen.\n\nNFL Network's Ian Rapoport said earlier on Thursday that the hope is Adams could return next week, but that is far from certain.\n\n\"So, don't expect him to play tonight, but the hope is, next game, if there's enough time to recover, we could see Davante out there.\"\n\nBut, earlier in the week, Rapoport floated the possibility that Adams could miss the rest of the regular season with his hamstring injury.\n\n\"There are only a couple types of injuries this time of year: there's an injury where a guy is fine, there's an injury where he's back for the playoffs, and then he's done,\" Rapoport said. \"The hope is that this is one of those he's back for the playoffs.\"\n\nWhat Adams has going for him next week is the Rams will enjoy a mini-bye thanks to their Thursday night game in Week 16, giving him 11 days with Los Angeles playing on Monday night in Week 17.\n\nAnother positive for Adams was his ability to do at least some work in pre-game warm-ups on Thursday night.\n\nWe should get our next update on Adams at the top of next week, but if not it won't come any later than Thursday, when Los Angeles drops its first injury report of the week.\n\nWhy CeeDee Lamb's 2 missed practices aren't a concern for Week 16\n\nQuinn Ewers can end 21-year drought for Texas quarterbacks\n\nBroncos' NFL record could be shattered by Dolphins in 2026\n\nWhat Patrick Mahomes tearing 2 ligaments means for recovery timeline\n\nJaguars offense in midst of streak not seen in NFL this season",

    "fullText": "A little over 24 hours before Texas A&M (11-1, 7-1 SEC) hosts Miami (10-2) in the first round of the College Football Playoff, the Aggie media team, which released a tease of the uniform Texas A&M will wear, maroon jerseys, while an updated video on Thursday night provided a glimpse at the full uniform, which will rival Miami's regular white road look.\n\nAccording to the video, Texas A&M will enter Kyle Field on Saturday wearing maroon helmets, maroon jerseys, and white pants, which is the standard home look. The only exception was the blackout look against Mississippi State earlier this season, which resulted in a 31-9 win over the Bulldogs.\n\nHowever, the Aggies tricked all of us earlier this week after hinting at a potential blackout, which would have been a first for an early 11:00 a.m. kickoff. Still, whatever the Aggies wear isn't going to magically help this team get past the Hurricanes, who will field one of the best defenses in the country, and one of the more electrifying playmakers in freshman wide receiver Malachi Toney.\n\nHead coach Mike Elko is hoping that playing at home three weeks after losing to Texas on the road to end the regular season is the recipe for success, paired with a solid week of practice. The news is that star running back Le'Veon Moss, who has missed the last six games due to an ankle injury, is \"questionable\" to play on Saturday. At the same time, senior linebacker Scooby Williams and safety Bryce Anderson are \"probable\" with 75% chance to take the field.\n\nEither way, Texas A&M's best path to facing Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl is for starting quarterback Marcel Reed to play at an elite level, both in the pocket and with his legs, against a Miami defensive line led by Rueben Bain, who is looking to ruin the Aggies' offensive game plan.\n\nEvery era has led to this. #GigEm | #BTHOmiami pic.twitter.com/3zcz2bRZwp\n\n— Texas A&M Football (@AggieFootball) December 18, 2025\n\nTexas A&M will host Miami on Saturday at 11:00 a.m. with coverage on ABC and ESPN.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M will wear maroon/maroon/white vs. Miami in the CFP",

    "description": "On getting lucky, making mistakes, and what's next.",
    "fullText": "it's a privilege to write a piece with this title. so before jumping in, thank you.\n\nbelow is a recap of the incredible year we had at TRMNL. how we got lucky, mistakes made along the way, and what's next.\n\ni live in a small town. when asked what i do for work i reply \"IT.\" last year i joined the local Cattlemen's Association.\n\nneedless to say, TRMNL is fully remote. this year we grew from a few friends hacking on nights and weekends to 25+ across 4 continents, 6 countries, and 3 facilities. the latest one is actually under construction and i'll talk more about it later.\n\nremote has become the standard for software companies, but hardware is a bit trickier. in the future i'd like more face to face environments so we can move faster. in < 90 days we're hosting our first team retreat.\n\nanyway. TRMNL is proud to have dedicated support, operations, marketing, open source, and core engineering members. learn more about each person here.\n\nwe launched on Kickstarter in June 2024 with a single device, the TRMNL OG. i always wanted to legally name something OG and now governments around the globe have our EC licenses filed in their digital coffers.\n\nour firmware runs on ESP32s, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and beyond. you can even run TRMNL in your browser (Chrome, Firefox) or join 1,500+ people using our web app with their own hardware. which by design we have no way of even detecting.\n\nto meet customer demand in 2025 we rebuilt our Framework UI kit, render pipeline, and firmware. perhaps most important, this year we improved our utility with 100s of new plugins. in January 2025 we had ~60, today we have over 700. nearly 90% of publicly listed TRMNL plugins are built and maintained by the TRMNL community.\n\ni should have put this section at the top.\n\nTRMNL exists because most products do not respect the most valuable currency: our attention. most products do not respect privacy. most products stop working when the maker says \"i quit.\" most products cannot be self-repaired. most products need to charge every weekend.\n\nour vision is to help you stay focused in an increasingly distracting world. we do that with ambient technology, as few emails and notifications as possible, and a thoughtful team who cares.\n\nas a rule we don't kiss and tell, but here's what i can share: 10s of 1000s of homes and offices use TRMNL.\n\nwe got here without a single ad on Facebook or Instagram or Ticky Tocky. our \"analytics stack\" is a free dashboard, visible to all. should i lock that down?\n\nthese outcomes let us provide for our families and make TRMNL better every day at $0 additional cost to customers.\n\nif one day we stop getting lucky, we'll open source everything.\n\ni've never run a hardware company. i've never made products for consumers, or used Discord, or written C++. before TRMNL i sold (mostly boring) B2B software.\n\nso this year i learned to depend on a team of specialists who dream and bring ideas to fruition. but we (i) didn't get everything right. here are some of those blunders:\n\nin each case we found a solution, but with more experience we could have avoided spending the Good Will reserves.\n\ni'll posit that a single theme carried us through the mistakes: ownership.\n\nwhen TRMNL screws up we don't hide it. we invite the community to help make it right and we observe Hammurabi's Code. our engineers are available on live chat nearly 24 hours a day. some companies behave otherwise. but TRMNL customers are smart, and smart people have sophisticated BS detectors. as mom always said: do not insult the hand that feeds you.\n\nanother scary endeavor in 2025 was bootstrapping our own logistics network and warehouse tech. TRMNL runs 2 facilities, with a 3rd underway, where all devices are assembled and shipped by our team. call me old fashioned, but it's important that my desk is just a few steps from a packing station.\n\nfinally, we started investing in the community via the Creator Fund. over $20,000 has been distributed in its first 2 months and we couldn't be happier with downstream effects. whether you write code, speak another language, or design 3D models, TRMNL wants to reward you for making a difference.\n\nbeyond the usual suspects of pushing bugs directly to master or waiting 5 months to implement a popular feature request, a few grey swans appeared.\n\nwe mitigated each issue with smart people and debate-driven solutions. some of our tariff bills are still frozen by UPS. every lost shipment or damaged device was replaced at our expense.\n\nand this is kind of the other side of entrepreneurship generally. every team shows up when things are good. the measure of an organization's resolve is whether they keep hacking when things go wrong.\n\nmark my words: more is coming out than has come out.\n\nfrom products to features, enterprise solutions, even better pricing, federating the open source ecosystem, IRL events...\n\na few teasers. i intend to launch our 3rd product in-person, Spring 2026 at our Berlin warehouse. customers in the region will receive a physical invitation in the mail.\n\nwe're grateful for the opportunity you gave us in 2025. it's our turn to give back in 2026. to those who celebrate, Merry Christmas and happy New Year.",

    "description": "Physicist doubts work like Higgs boson identification achievable now as academics are expected to 'keep churning out papers'",
    "fullText": "Peter Higgs, the British physicist who gave his name to the Higgs boson, believes no university would employ him in today's academic system because he would not be considered \"productive\" enough.\n\nThe emeritus professor at Edinburgh University, who says he has never sent an email, browsed the internet or even made a mobile phone call, published fewer than 10 papers after his groundbreaking work, which identified the mechanism by which subatomic material acquires mass, was published in 1964.\n\nHe doubts a similar breakthrough could be achieved in today's academic culture, because of the expectations on academics to collaborate and keep churning out papers. He said: \"It's difficult to imagine how I would ever have enough peace and quiet in the present sort of climate to do what I did in 1964.\"\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian en route to Stockholm to receive the 2013 Nobel prize for science, Higgs, 84, said he would almost certainly have been sacked had he not been nominated for the Nobel in 1980.\n\nEdinburgh University's authorities then took the view, he later learned, that he \"might get a Nobel prize – and if he doesn't we can always get rid of him\".\n\nHiggs said he became \"an embarrassment to the department when they did research assessment exercises\". A message would go around the department saying: \"Please give a list of your recent publications.\" Higgs said: \"I would send back a statement: 'None.' \"\n\nHiggs revealed that his career had also been jeopardised by his disagreements in the 1960s and 70s with the then principal, Michael Swann, who went on to chair the BBC. Higgs objected to Swann's handling of student protests and to the university's shareholdings in South African companies during the apartheid regime. \"[Swann] didn't understand the issues, and denounced the student leaders.\"\n\nHe regrets that the particle he identified in 1964 became known as the \"God particle\".\n\nHe said: \"Some people get confused between the science and the theology. They claim that what happened at Cern proves the existence of God.\"\n\nAn atheist since the age of 10, he fears the nickname \"reinforces confused thinking in the heads of people who are already thinking in a confused way. If they believe that story about creation in seven days, are they being intelligent?\"\n\nHe also revealed that he turned down a knighthood in 1999. \"I'm rather cynical about the way the honours system is used, frankly. A whole lot of the honours system is used for political purposes by the government in power.\"\n\nHe has not yet decided which way he will vote in the referendum on Scottish independence. \"My attitude would depend a little bit on how much progress the lunatic right of the Conservative party makes in trying to get us out of Europe. If the UK were threatening to withdraw from Europe, I would certainly want Scotland to be out of that.\"\n\nHe has never been tempted to buy a television, but was persuaded to watch The Big Bang Theory last year, and said he wasn't impressed.",

    "description": "Read this article on the Lovable blog",
    "fullText": "Today, we're announcing that Lovable has raised $330 million in Series B funding at a $6.6 billion valuation, led by CapitalG and Menlo Ventures' Anthology fund.\n\nAdditional investors in this round include the venture arms of leading companies building the future of work: NVentures (NVIDIA’s venture capital arm), Salesforce Ventures, Databricks Ventures, T.Capital (Deutsche Telekom), Atlassian Ventures, and HubSpot Ventures. They’re joined by Khosla Ventures, DST Global, EQT Growth, Kinship Ventures, and returning investors Accel, Creandum, and Evantic, among others.\n\nWe launched Lovable to empower the 99% — the people who've had ideas but lacked the technical skills to bring them to life. Now, we're watching a transformation unfold in real time.\n\nA new category of people has emerged: builders. They're the product manager who wants to show, not just tell. The marketer with projects stuck in engineering backlogs. The ops team using outdated software for internal tooling. The nurse who sees a better way to visualize patient journeys. The artist in need of a website with an e-commerce platform integration—in time for the holidays. The founder turning a side hustle into the main thing.\n\nAnd they're building at a scale we never imagined:\n\nLet’s look at what builders are doing in large enterprises, like Klarna and Deutsche Telekom:\n\nJorge Luthe, Senior Director of Product at Zendesk:\n\nThanks to Lovable’s rapid prototyping and real-time collaboration capabilities, we’ve dramatically streamlined our product development process. What once took six weeks — from idea to working prototype — now takes just three hours. This shift has enabled our product management, UX, and engineering teams to collaborate faster and more effectively than ever before.\n\nShipping real products in production:\n\nDharmin Parikh, Director of Product at Uber AI:\n\nLovable makes it easy for our teams to create interactive prototypes and move from idea to decision with less friction.\n\nJonathan Abrahamson, Chief Product and Digital Officer at Deutsche Telekom:\n\nAI is transforming how enterprises build and validate products. For a 2,000-person product & engineering organization, this goes far beyond faster prototypes. It demands a new approach to how the best ideas come to life. Lovable shares that perspective, and their vision pairs naturally with how we will develop and ship products at Deutsche Telekom.\n\nAnd founders are building new businesses, too:\n\nThis investment accelerates our work in three key areas:\n\nDeeper integrations. Builders don't work in isolation. They use Notion for docs, Linear for tickets, Jira for sprints, Miro for brainstorms. Lovable already connects to these tools, and we're going deeper — so the context you've already built informs what you create next.\n\nEnhanced collaboration and governance. As more teams adopt Lovable, they need the features enterprises expect. We're continuing to invest in making Lovable ready for organizations of every size.\n\nInfrastructure to take products from prototype to production. Lovable isn't just for demos. With built-in hosting, databases, authentication, and payments, people ship real products — not just mockups. We're continuing to build out the capabilities that make this possible.\n\nHere’s why these firms are working with Lovable.\n\nLaela Sturdy, Managing Partner at CapitalG:\n\nLovable has done something rare: built a product that enterprises and founders both love. The demand we're seeing from Fortune 500 companies signals a fundamental shift in how software gets built. We're proud to lead this round and support Lovable's vision of making software creation accessible to everyone.\n\nMatt Murphy, Partner at Menlo Ventures:\n\nLovable is a beloved product for all the right reasons. They've done what was previously unimaginable by turning a latent market of tens of millions of people into web developers and content creators. We love category builders like our previous early investments in Uber and Anthropic—companies that have the opportunity to be enormous. Lovable is showing exactly that trajectory.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow, Co-founder and General Partner at Kinship Ventures:\n\nWhat makes Lovable compelling is how accessible it is to non-technical founders. You don’t need to write code to get started—you need clarity of thought. Imagine that idea scrawled on the back of a napkin can magically turn into a working prototype with a real codebase with just one sentence. That’s what Lovable unlocks for founders. Lovable gives founders a new kind of agency and confidence. And, most importantly, speed. That shift is deeply aligned with how we think about empowerment at Kinship.\n\nThis is the age of the builder. A seismic shift in what's possible. The story belongs to the teachers, product managers, founders, and dreamers who now have the tools to bring their ideas to life. See their stories.",

    "title": "Trump Is Doubling Down on His Disastrous A.I. Chip Policy",
    "description": "National security shouldn’t ever have a price.",
    "fullText": "President Trump announced last week that he would allow China to buy an advanced artificial intelligence chip, the H200, from the American company Nvidia, doubling down on a misguided decision he made over the summer to sell China another advanced chip, the H20. The H200 is about six times as powerful and will be an even greater boon to China’s military and A.I. development.\n\nMr. Trump explained that in return, the U.S. government will charge a 25 percent fee on all sales of the H200. But U.S. national security and technological dominance shouldn’t ever have a price — let alone such a low one.\n\nFor years, both the Trump and Biden administrations had successfully sought as large a lead as possible over China in A.I. In 2018, the first Trump administration wisely cut off key companies in China from the most advanced chip-making equipment. In 2020, Mr. Trump helped reverse the deployment of nonsecure Chinese 5G telecommunications networks by Britain and other allies by banning the sale of advanced chips to the Chinese tech giant Huawei. The Biden administration substantially expanded those controls and added new ones. Both administrations said that China would use American-made chips to develop more sophisticated A.I. and modernize its military.\n\nHampered by those policies, China has struggled to make advanced A.I. chips, despite a push of around $200 billion starting in 2014. None of China’s chips are close to matching the capacity of the H200. Huawei, a leading Chinese chipmaker, projects that it will not be able to match the H200’s performance until the end of 2027 at the earliest — and even that estimate sounds optimistic.\n\nIn addition to making less capable chips, China struggles to make them in large quantities. Trump administration officials testified in June that China will make just 200,000 chips per year — not even enough for a single data center. By contrast, Taiwan, the United States and the rest of the democratic world will produce more than 10 million far-superior chips per year. All told, China will produce a total computing power that is a mere 1 percent to 3 percent of what U.S. companies will produce.\n\nThe chief executive of DeepSeek, a prominent A.I. company in China, admitted in 2024 that access to chips was the company’s biggest impediment. In the summer of 2025, DeepSeek reportedly tried and failed to train a new system on Chinese chips. When DeepSeek released its latest model several weeks ago, it acknowledged that the system still lags behind U.S. versions and cited computing limitations as the key reason.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump’s announcement last week, Chinese companies jumped at the chance to buy the H200 — more evidence that America’s chip advantage is real.\n\nThe Trump administration argues that selling chips to China will keep China “addicted” to American products and undermine its efforts to improve production. But China knows better. In the days since Mr. Trump announced his decision to sell the H200, there have been reports that China will invest an additional $70 billion to improve its domestic production of chips. According to a report on Sunday in the Global Times, which is controlled by China’s ruling party, Nvidia’s advanced chips would be used only until Chinese tech companies can transition to domestic alternatives.\n\nIt’s all part of the same pattern, whether the product is solar panels, electric vehicles or telecommunications: China imports Western technology until its own production catches up; then it cuts out American companies. President Xi Jinping has long said that relying on others for core technology “is like building a house on someone else’s foundation.”\n\nIt should be obvious that the United States should not sell China advanced technology that China could use to target American troops and intelligence officers. Advanced A.I. will improve China’s cyber operations, intelligence analysis and weaponry. According to reports, the Trump White House has concluded that Alibaba, one of China’s biggest A.I. companies, provides technology support for the Chinese military, including some of its operations against U.S. targets. (Alibaba has denied this claim.) Other reports suggest that DeepSeek evades U.S. export controls and aids Chinese military and intelligence operations. Chinese procurement documents show that the People’s Liberation Army is also trying to get its hands on advanced U.S. chips.\n\nThe bipartisan House committee on China was right when it said last week that China will use the H200 to “strengthen its military capabilities and totalitarian surveillance,” and when it recommended tightening export controls rather than loosening them.\n\nThe Trump administration is well aware of how much A.I. matters to national security, which makes its decision even more baffling. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, last week proclaimed, “The future of American warfare is here, and it’s spelled ‘A.I.’” And when the Department of Justice recently announced charges against two individuals accused of smuggling H200s to China, it underscored the national security issues: “These chips are the building blocks of A.I. superiority and are integral to modern military applications. The country that controls these chips will control A.I. technology; the country that controls A.I. technology will control the future.”\n\nFor now, that country is the United States. In 2017, Li Keqiang, China’s premier at the time, told Mr. Trump during a meeting in Beijing that China would come to dominate all technologies, including A.I., and that America would export little more than soybeans and corn. Last week’s decision helps make that unlikely dream a reality.\n\nBen Buchanan is an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies and an adviser to A.I. and cybersecurity companies.

    "description": "This post will introduce a tutorial on how to build an app for ChatGPT using Apollo Client and Apollo MCP Server. You’ll have what you need to get started with our opinionated stack for building these apps.",
    "fullText": "Building Apps for ChatGPT with Apollo MCP Server and Apollo Client\n\nIn early October, OpenAI introduced the ChatGPT Apps SDK with a handful of launch partners. These “apps” could be invoked by ChatGPT via Model Context Protocol (MCP) and would be embedded directly into the ChatGPT interface. In their intro video, they showed use cases like asking for flights, hotel locations, house listings, and more, including teasing the idea of asking follow up questions to ChatGPT.\n\nImagine your application being part of the conversation, allowing the user to ask follow up questions, and having your app be responsive to those questions. These are action-oriented conversational apps where the LLM can take action on behalf of a user with rich interactive UIs.\n\nThis idea quickly caught fire, and now the MCP apps spec is proposing a standardized approach to create these kinds of experiences, with other AI vendors sure to follow suit. We’re excited about the potential here, and are working on tools to abstract away all of the AI provider details from you with a great developer experience, allowing you to focus on building your app instead of worrying about vendor idiosyncrasies and evolving standards.\n\nWe want this to be a true “build once” solution where you can deploy your app anywhere that supports one of the protocols that we will support. This way, you don’t need to host a separate MCP Server, and build a separate app, for every provider and sub-protocol that emerges.\n\nYou can instead focus on your customers.\n\nThis post will introduce a tutorial on how to build an app for ChatGPT using Apollo Client and Apollo MCP Server. By the end of it, you’ll have what you need to get started with our opinionated stack for building these apps. If you prefer to dive into the template and follow along, you can find the repo here.\n\nBased on the OpenAI documentation and examples, to build one of these apps you would:\n\nWe don’t want you to have to do any of this. You shouldn’t have to focus on any of the inner workings of this sub-protocol, or even think about MCP. Your front-end engineers shouldn’t have a new dependency on your platform engineers. Instead, you should be able to focus on building exciting and compelling experiences for your customers.\n\nInstead of this feeling like learning 100% how to build apps from scratch, this should be 90% reusing what you already know about building apps, and 10% learning about the specifics of this new paradigm.\n\nWe wanted to make this as easy as possible and decided to reach for tools that are already familiar to many of our users: Apollo MCP Server and Apollo Client. If you want to follow along in this tutorial, you can find all the code in our OpenAI Apps SDK demo.\n\nTo build this app we have two components: a React app and Apollo MCP Server. This solution works without any additional MCP Server configuration. The client gets to focus on their application, not the MCP server configuration.\n\nStarting in our main.tsx file, we create an ApolloClient instance and ApolloProvider, very similar to how we would on a traditional React app, but we’re going to import them from @apollo/client-ai-apps instead of the normal location. This is an Apollo Client integration package, similar to @apollo/client-nextjs. This allows us to do a lot of setup and details behind the scenes of dealing with data being exchanged over MCP.\n\nNow we can use the normal useQuery and useMutation hooks as we normally would!\n\nFor example, I can write a component that gets my TOP_PRODUCTS:\n\nLooks pretty normal, but what is that @tool directive on the operation? That is allowing you to declare in your app a tool that will be exposed to the LLM, including a name and description. At the same time, we are registering the operation that will be executed when this tool is called (and therefore the data that should be delivered as part of this tool), and the graphql variables become the input schema for the tool!\n\nThis is really exciting because we’re able to declare so much with so little code. Also, these are on-the-fly tool declarations. I don’t need a platform team to create these tools for me on an MCP server!\n\nAnother important aspect of this solution is showing the right component based on what tool was called by the LLM. It turns out we’ve had this problem solved for years now with React Router!\n\nTo do this, we provide a useToolEffect hook, which works the same way as a useEffect, but allows you to run the effect based on which tool was executed.\n\nUsing this hook, and a very familiar navigate function from react-router, I can express that when the “Top Products” tool is called, I should navigate to the /home view.\n\nThe magic of this solution really comes from a custom Vite plugin called the ApplicationManifestPlugin which extracts all the operations, tools, and metadata from your React app and generates a .application-manifest.json file:\n\nThis plugin runs during dev and build time and generates a file that looks something like this:\n\nWhat you’ll see contained in this manifest is everything that the Apollo MCP Server needs to automatically generate the resource and tools for your app. There’s no need to create or configure any of this on the MCP Server. It will automatically pick it up based on your manifest file.\n\nAnd that’s it! You can build your React app and declare tools alongside the data declarations and the tooling will do the rest. At the time this post was written, you would then test your app in ChatGPT using developer mode. OpenAI outlines how to try the app in their documentation.\n\nWith the MCP apps spec hot off the press, and likely other providers working on an answer to ChatGPT’s AppsSDK, we have a very important goal: To abstract away all of the provider details from you with a great developer experience, allowing you to focus on building your app instead.\n\nWe want this to be a true “build once” solution where you can deploy your app anywhere that supports one of the protocols that we will support. This way, you don’t need to host a separate MCP Server, and build a separate app, for every provider and sub-protocol that emerges.\n\nYou can instead focus on your customers.\n\nThis solution is exciting for platform engineers because it doesn’t require them being in the loop and becoming a blocker for the frontend teams they are looking to empower. A single Apollo MCP Server powers apps across providers and accelerates platform engineering. For frontend engineers, this removes the burden of sub-protocol concerns and lets them focus on building high-quality user experiences.\n\nIt’s important to note that these apps are still very, very early.\n\nRemember many, many years ago when “apps” first appeared on the iPhone? Many people didn’t understand why they needed a mobile app when they already had a website. It’s kind of funny looking back now because we had no idea what we were even looking at or how much it would change and shape our future.\n\nThat’s about where we are now with these conversational chat apps. Customers and companies alike don’t yet “get” these apps. The app store just launched. But once these things fall into place, and we hit an industry mind share, we believe we’re going to see an explosion of conversational, chat-based applications.\n\nTry out building apps for ChatGPT today with Apollo Client and Apollo MCP Server by going to our Template Repo and following the README. We’d love to hear what you think.",

    "description": "Apple says it can now collect any money a developer owes the tech giant at any time.",
    "fullText": "Apple on Wednesday released an updated developer license agreement that gives the company permission to recoup unpaid funds, such as commissions or any other fees, by deducting them from in-app purchases it processes on developers’ behalf, among other methods.\n\nThe change will impact developers in regions where local law allows them to link to external payment systems. In these cases, developers must report those payments back to Apple to pay the required commissions or fees.\n\nThe changed agreement seemingly gives Apple a way to collect what it believes is the correct fee if the company determines a developer has underreported their earnings.\n\nApple’s policies in this area are complex, but the change could impact developers in markets like the EU, U.S., and, now, Japan, where developers using external payment systems may be required to pay Apple varying fees or commissions depending on local law. (In the U.S., the legality of these commissions is still being disputed. A federal appeals court earlier this month ruled that a district court should consider allowing Apple to collect some commission, though not the full 27% fee it previously charged.)\n\nIn its new developer agreement, Apple states it will “offset or recoup” what it believes it is owed, including “any amounts collected by Apple on your behalf from end-users.” This means Apple could recoup funds from developers’ in-app purchases — like those for digital goods, services, and subscriptions — or from one-time fees for paid applications.\n\nAdditionally, Apple notes that it has the right to collect this money “at any time” and “from time to time,” meaning developers could face surprise deductions if Apple believes they’ve miscalculated what they owe.\n\nThe agreement doesn’t specify how Apple will determine whether it’s owed money.\n\nThe types of developer payments that vary over time are limited and include commissions, fees, and taxes. Among these is the Core Technology Fee (CTF) in the EU, which currently costs €0.50 for each first annual install exceeding one million in the past 12 months. In January 2026, Apple will transition from the CTF to a new fee, called the Core Technology Commission (CTC), a more complicated percentage-based fee. Apple will collect the CTC from apps that use external payment methods or are distributed under its alternative business terms for the EU.\n\nThe updated developer agreement also gives Apple the right to collect unpaid amounts from any “affiliates, parents, or subsidiaries” related to the account that owes money. In practical terms, that means Apple could collect the money from developers’ other apps, or from apps published by a parent company.\n\nThese changes are detailed in Schedules 2 and 3, section 3.4, which focuses on the delivery of applications to end users.\n\nThese are not the only modifications to the agreement. Apple is also introducing sections devoted to its age assurance technology, new terms for iOS apps in Japan, and other requirements.\n\nOf interest, Apple is defining requirements for voice-based assistants (like AI chatbots) that are activated via the side button on the iPhone and is banning recordings made without user awareness. This includes audio and video recordings, as well as screen recordings, which are often used by developers to identity issues users face when navigating apps or to locate bugs.\n\nTo be clear, Apple isn’t banning these recordings outright. The company is simply adding language that says: “Your Application may not be designed to facilitate Recordings of others without their awareness.” How Apple will interpret that rule remains to be seen.\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment ahead of publication.",

    "fullText": "Margaret Elaine Hamilton (née Heafield; born August 17, 1936) is an American computer scientist. She directed the Software Engineering Division at the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, where she led the development of the on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo Guidance Computer for the Apollo program. She later founded two software companies, Higher Order Software in 1976 and Hamilton Technologies in 1986, both in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nHamilton has published more than 130 papers, proceedings, and reports, about sixty projects, and six major programs. She coined the term \"software engineering\", stating, \"I began to use the term 'software engineering' to distinguish it from hardware and other kinds of engineering, yet treat each type of engineering as part of the overall systems engineering process.\"[1][2][3]\n\nOn November 22, 2016, Hamilton received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from president Barack Obama for her work leading to the development of on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo Moon missions.[4]\n\nMargaret Elaine Heafield was born August 17, 1936, in Paoli, Indiana,[5] to Kenneth Heafield and Ruth Esther Heafield (née Partington).[6][7] The family later moved to Michigan,[8] where Margaret graduated from Hancock High School in 1954.[6]\n\nShe studied mathematics at the University of Michigan in 1955 before transferring to Earlham College, where her mother had been a student.[9][10] She earned a BA in mathematics with a minor in philosophy in 1958.[9][11] She cites Florence Long, the head of the math department at Earlham, as helping with her desire to pursue abstract mathematics and become a mathematics professor.[12]\n\nShe says her poet father and headmaster grandfather inspired her to include a minor in philosophy in her studies.[13]\n\nIn Boston, Hamilton initially intended to enroll in graduate study in abstract mathematics at Brandeis University.[6] However, in mid-1959, Hamilton began working for Edward Norton Lorenz, in the meteorology department at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[14] She developed software for predicting weather, programming on the LGP-30 and the PDP-1 computers at Marvin Minsky's Project MAC.[15][16][17] Her work contributed to Lorenz's future publications on chaos theory, as acknowledged by Lorenz himself.[14] At the time, computer science and software engineering were not yet established disciplines; instead, programmers learned on the job with hands-on experience.[18] She moved on to another project in the summer of 1961, and hired and trained Ellen Fetter as her replacement.[14]\n\nFrom 1961 to 1963, Hamilton worked on the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Project at the MIT Lincoln Lab,[16] where she was one of the programmers who wrote software for the prototype AN/FSQ-7 computer (the XD-1), used by the U.S. Air Force to search for possibly unfriendly aircraft.[5] She also wrote software for a satellite tracking project at the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories.[16] The SAGE Project was an extension of Project Whirlwind, started by MIT to create a computer system that could predict weather systems and track their movements using simulators. SAGE was soon developed for military use in anti-aircraft air defense. Hamilton said:\n\nWhat they used to do when you came into this organization as a beginner, was to assign you this program which nobody was able to ever figure out or get to run. When I was the beginner they gave it to me as well. And what had happened was it was tricky programming, and the person who wrote it took delight in the fact that all of his comments were in Greek and Latin. So I was assigned this program and I actually got it to work. It even printed out its answers in Latin and Greek. I was the first one to get it to work.[19]\n\nIt was her efforts on this project that made her a candidate for the position at NASA as the lead developer for Apollo flight software.[6]\n\nHamilton learned of the Apollo project in 1965 and wanted to get involved due to it being \"very exciting\" as a Moon program.[23] She joined the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed the Apollo Guidance Computer for the Apollo lunar exploration program. Hamilton was the first programmer hired for the Apollo project at MIT and the first female programmer in the project,[23][24] and later became Director of the Software Engineering Division.[25] She was responsible for the team writing and testing all onboard in-flight software for the Apollo spacecraft's Command and Lunar Module and for the subsequent Skylab space station.[26][27][18] Another part of her team designed and developed the systems software.[28] This included error detection and recovery software such as restarts and the Display Interface Routines (also known as the Priority Displays), which Hamilton designed and developed.[29] She worked to gain hands-on experience during a time when computer science courses were uncommon and software engineering courses did not exist.[18]\n\nHer areas of expertise include systems design and software development, enterprise and process modeling, development paradigm, formal systems modeling languages, system-oriented objects for systems modeling and development, automated life-cycle environments, methods for maximizing software reliability and reuse, domain analysis, correctness by built-in language properties, open-architecture techniques for robust systems, full life-cycle automation, quality assurance, seamless integration, error detection and recovery techniques, human-machine interface systems, operating systems, end-to-end testing techniques, and life-cycle management techniques.[18][20] These techniques are intended to make code more reliable because they help programmers identify and fix errors sooner in the development process.\n\nIn one of the critical moments of the Apollo 11 mission, the Apollo Guidance Computer, together with the on-board flight software, averted an abort of the landing on the Moon. Three minutes before the lunar lander reached the Moon's surface, several computer alarms were triggered. According to software engineer Robert Wills, Buzz Aldrin entered the codes to request that the computer display altitude and other data on the computer's screen. The system was designed to support seven simultaneous programs running, but Aldrin's request was the eighth. This action was something he requested many times while working in the simulator. The result was a series of unexpected error codes during the live descent. The on-board flight software captured these alarms with the \"never supposed to happen displays\" interrupting the astronauts with priority alarm displays.[30]\nHamilton had prepared for just this situation years before:\n\nThere was one other failsafe that Hamilton likes to remember. Her \"priority display\" innovation had created a knock-on risk that astronaut and computer would slip out of sync just when it mattered most. As the alarms went off and priority displays replaced normal ones, the actual switchover to new programmes behind the screens was happening \"a step slower\" than it would today.\n\nHamilton had thought long and hard about this. It meant that if Aldrin, say, hit a button on the priority display too quickly, he might still get a \"normal\" response. Her solution: when you see a priority display, first count to\nfive.[31]\n\nBecause of the flight software's system-software's error detection and recovery techniques that included its system-wide \"kill and recompute\" from a \"safe place\" restart approach to its snapshot and rollback techniques, the Display Interface Routines (AKA the priority displays) together with its man-in-the-loop capabilities were able to be created in order to have the capability to interrupt the astronauts' normal mission displays with priority displays of critical alarms in case of an emergency. This depended on our assigning a unique priority to every process in the software in order to ensure that all of its events would take place in the correct order and at the right time relative to everything else that was going on.[39]\n\nHamilton's priority alarm displays interrupted the astronauts' normal displays to warn them that there was an emergency \"giving the astronauts a go/no-go decision (to land or not to land)\".[40] Jack Garman, a NASA computer engineer in mission control, recognized the meaning of the errors that were presented to the astronauts by the priority displays and shouted, \"Go, go!\" and they continued.[41] Paul Curto, a senior technologist who nominated Hamilton for a NASA Space Act Award, called Hamilton's work \"the foundation for ultra-reliable software design\".[28]\n\nHamilton later wrote of the incident:\n\nThe computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough to recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks than it should be performing. It then sent out an alarm, which meant to the astronaut, 'I'm overloaded with more tasks than I should be doing at this time and I'm going to keep only the more important tasks'; i.e., the ones needed for landing ... Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software. The software's action, in this case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones ... If the computer hadn't recognized this problem and taken recovery action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful Moon landing it was.\n\n— Letter from Margaret H. Hamilton, Director of Apollo Flight Computer Programming MIT Draper Laboratory, Cambridge, Massachusetts, titled \"Computer Got Loaded\", published in Datamation, March 1, 1971[42]\n\nIn 1976, Hamilton co-founded with Saydean Zeldin a company called Higher Order Software (HOS)[43] to further develop ideas about error prevention and fault tolerance emerging from their experience at MIT working on the Apollo program.[44][45] They created a product called USE.IT, based on the HOS methodology they developed at MIT.[46][47][48] It was successfully used in numerous government programs[49][50] including a project to formalize and implement C-IDEF, an automated version of IDEF, a modeling language developed by the U.S. Air Force in the Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing (ICAM) project.[51] In 1980, British-Israeli computer scientist David Harel published a proposal for a structured programming language derived from HOS from the viewpoint of and/or subgoals.[52] Others have used HOS to formalize the semantics of linguistic quantifiers,[53] and to formalize the design of reliable real-time embedded systems.[54]\n\nHamilton was the CEO of HOS through 1984[44] and left the company in 1985. In March 1986, she founded Hamilton Technologies, Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company was developed around the Universal Systems Language (USL) and its associated automated environment, the 001 Tool Suite, based on her paradigm of development before the fact for systems design and software development.[35][55][56]\n\nHamilton has been credited with naming the discipline of \"software engineering\".[1][57][58][59] Hamilton details how she came to make up the term \"software engineering\":\n\nWhen I first came up with the term, no one had heard of it before, at least in our world. It was an ongoing joke for a long time. They liked to kid me about my radical ideas. It was a memorable day when one of the most respected hardware gurus explained to everyone in a meeting that he agreed with me that the process of building software should also be considered an engineering discipline, just like with hardware. Not because of his acceptance of the new 'term' per se, but because we had earned his and the acceptance of the others in the room as being in an engineering field in its own right.[39]\n\nWhen Hamilton started using the term \"software engineering\" during the early Apollo missions,[60] software development was not taken seriously compared to other engineering disciplines,[61] nor was it regarded as a science. Hamilton was concerned with legitimizing software development as an engineering discipline.[62] Over time the term \"software engineering\" gained the same respect as any other technical discipline.[57][63] The IEEE Software September/October 2018 issue celebrates the 50th anniversary of software engineering.[64] Hamilton talks about \"Errors\" and how they influenced her work related to software engineering and how her language, USL, could be used to prevent the majority of \"Errors\" in a system.[65] With USL, rather than continuing to test for errors, her program was designed to keep most errors out of the system from the beginning.[66] USL was created after her knowledge and experience from the Apollo mission, in which she determined a mathematical theory for systems and software.[67] This method was then, and still is, highly impactful to the field of software engineering. Writing in Wired, Robert McMillan noted: \"At MIT she assisted in the creation of the core principles in computer programming as she worked with her colleagues in writing code for the world's first portable computer\".[68] Hamilton's innovations go beyond the feats of playing an important role in getting humans to the Moon. According to Wired's Karen Tegan Padir: \"She, along with that other early programming pioneer, COBOL inventor Grace Hopper, also deserve tremendous credit for helping to open the door for more women to enter and succeed in STEM fields like software.\"[69][70]\n\nIn 2017, a \"Women of NASA\" LEGO set went on sale featuring minifigures of Hamilton, astronauts Mae Jemison and Sally Ride, and NASA's first Chief of Astronomy, Nancy Grace Roman. The set was initially proposed by Maia Weinstock as a tribute to the women's contributions to NASA history, and Hamilton's section of the set features a recreation of her famous 1969 photo posing with a stack of her software listings.[71][72]\n\nIn 2019, to celebrate 50 years after the Apollo landing, Google decided to make a tribute to Hamilton. The mirrors at the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility were configured to create a picture of Hamilton and the Apollo 11 by moonlight.[73]\n\nMargo Madison, a fictional NASA engineer in the alternate history series For All Mankind, was inspired by Hamilton.[74]\n\nHamilton has a sister, Kathryn Heafield.[86]\n\nShe met her first husband, James Cox Hamilton,[87] in the mid-1950s while attending college. They were married on June 15, 1958, the summer after she graduated from Earlham.[88][87] She briefly taught high school mathematics and French at a public school in Boston, Indiana.[88][16] The couple then moved to Boston, Massachusetts,[16] where they had a daughter, Lauren, born on November 10, 1959.[6] They divorced in 1967 and Margaret married Dan Lickly two years later.[87][89]",

    "fullText": "The Texas City disaster was an industrial accident that occurred on April 16, 1947, in the port of Texas City, Texas, United States, located in Galveston Bay. It was the deadliest industrial accident in U.S. history and one of history's largest non-nuclear explosions.\n\nThe explosion was triggered by a mid-morning fire on board the French-registered vessel SS Grandcamp (docked at port), which detonated her cargo of about 2,300 tons (about 2,100 metric tons) of ammonium nitrate.[1] This started a chain reaction of fires and explosions aboard other ships and in nearby oil-storage facilities, ultimately killing at least 581 people, including all but one member of Texas City's volunteer fire department.[2]: 100\n\nThe disaster drew the first class action lawsuit against the United States government, on behalf of 8,485 plaintiffs, under the 1946 Federal Tort Claims Act.\n\nThe Port of Texas City is located in a protected harbor inland from Galveston, with relatively straight access to the Gulf of Mexico.[2]: 6  The port expanded greatly during World War II, as many wartime chemical and oil plants were located in or near the city. In 1946, some 4,000 ships loaded or unloaded cargo in the port.[2]: 9  The growth of the town caused a housing shortage, and housing for Black and Hispanic residents was located close to the port.[2]: 10  The nearest neighborhood was only .5 miles (0.80 km) away from the site of the explosion.[2]: 11  Within 1 mile (1.6 km) there were six major chemical or oil companies, nine piers, eleven warehouses, a grain elevator, and many homes.[2]: 12\n\nWhile oil and chemicals had been the major export, the port also began shipping ammonium nitrate in 1945.[2]: 15  The ammonium nitrate, needed either as fertilizer or an explosive, was manufactured in Nebraska and Iowa and shipped to Texas City by rail before being loaded onto ships.[3] The dedicated Texas City Terminal Railway provided final mile service directly to the port.[2]: 11  Export of ammonium nitrate increased significantly in the postwar years as ammunition manufacturing was converted into fertilizer manufacturing, to be sent for export to rebuild war-torn Europe.[2]: 20\n\nSS Grandcamp was a recently re-activated 437-foot-long (133 m) Liberty ship. Originally named SS Benjamin R. Curtis in Los Angeles in 1942, the ship served in the Pacific theater and was mothballed in Philadelphia after the war.[4] In a Cold War gesture, the ship was assigned by the U.S. to the French Line to assist in the rebuilding of France, along with other efforts in Europe. Accordingly, she was captained by a French crew led by Captain Charles de Guillebon. Along with the ammonium nitrate—a very common cargo on the high seas—she was carrying small-arms ammunition, machinery, and bales of sisal twine on the deck.[2]: 19  Her engine was undergoing repairs while docked and thus the ship was inoperable.[2]: 32\n\nAnother ship in the harbor, SS High Flyer, was docked about 600 feet (200 m) away from Grandcamp. The ammonium nitrate aboard the two ships, and fertilizer in an adjacent warehouse, were intended for export to farmers in Europe. Grandcamp had arrived from Houston, where the port authority did not permit the loading of ammonium nitrate.\n\nGrandcamp had a mixed cargo, containing chiefly ammonium nitrate, but also twine, peanuts, tobacco, some small arms ammunition, engineering equipment, and cotton.[2]: 1  The ammonium nitrate was manufactured in a patented process, mixed with clay, petrolatum, rosin and paraffin wax to avoid moisture caking. It was packaged in 100 pounds (45 kg) paper sacks.[2]: 20  Longshoremen reported the bags were warm to the touch before loading.\n\nHigh Flyer held an additional 961 short tons (872 t) of ammonium nitrate[1] and 1,800 short tons (1,600 metric tons) of sulfur.[citation needed]\n\nGrandcamp arrived in port on April 11, 1947, and began loading 2,500 short tons (2,300 t) of fertilizer on April 14, which were to be sent to France.[2]: 19  The storage deck of Grandcamp was divided into five storage holds, with a fuel oil bunker located between Hold 3 and Hold 4. The fertilizer was to be added to Hold 2 and Hold 4. The loading continued until interrupted by rain on the evening of the 15th. Loading was set to continue on the morning of the 16th, with the last 600 short tons (540 t) set to be loaded into the partially full Hold 4.[2]: 19, 35\n\nOn Wednesday, April 16, 1947, around 8 a.m., smoke was spotted in the cargo hold of Grandcamp while it was still moored. Longshoremen used a gallon jug of water and two fire extinguishers, but they had no effect and the cargo hold filled with smoke. The longshoremen were then ordered to leave the hold. At this point, the captain of Grandcamp ordered that no water be used, lest the cargo be ruined. Instead, he ordered all hatches sealed and the hold to be filled with steam in an attempt to smother the fire.[2]: 2  This was unlikely to be effective, as ammonium nitrate is an oxidizer, thus neutralizing the extinguishing properties of steam. The steam may have contributed to the fire by converting the ammonium nitrate to nitrous oxide, while augmenting the already intense heat in the ship's hold.[5] Around 8:30 a.m. the stevedores who were fighting the fire were ordered off the ship, likely because the heat had become too intense and there were concerns that the small arms ammunition could cook off.[2]: 31\n\nWhile the port had fire hydrants, it lacked its own fire engines. A call for outside help was sent at 8:37.[2]: 31  Responding fire departments included the Texas City volunteer fire department and the Republic Oil Refining Company firefighting team.[2]: 2  As crews fought the fire, the hatch on Hold 4 blew off from the pressure of the steam. A column of yellow-orange smoke billowed out, the typical color for nitrogen dioxide fumes.[1] The fire and its unusual-looking smoke attracted a crowd of about 500 spectators (including many children) along the shoreline, who believed they were at a safe distance.[6] Around 9:00, the fire abated slightly, but the steam suppression system was still actively heating Hold 4. Most of the crew had disembarked the ship, and Captain Guillebon was taking a headcount on the pier.[2]: 34\n\nAt 9:12 a.m., the ammonium nitrate reached an explosive threshold and the Grandcamp detonated. The exact cause is unknown, but the likeliest explanation is that the heat of the fire caused the fuel oil bunker adjacent to Hold 4 to split, pouring fuel onto the hot, decomposing fertilizer, creating an impromptu ANFO mixture that was susceptible to detonation.[2]: 35  The Grandcamp was entirely obliterated. The resulting explosion caused utter destruction within 2,000 feet (610 m) and extreme damage throughout the port. The tremendous blast produced a 15 ft (4.6 m) tsunami and a shockwave, levelling nearly 1,000 buildings on land.[2]: 3  The tsunami was responsible for a significant portion of onlooker deaths.[2]: 37\n\nFlying shrapnel resulted in ignition of refineries and chemical tanks along the waterfront. Falling bales of burning twine from Grandcamp's cargo added to the damage, and her anchor was hurled across the city. Two sightseeing airplanes flying nearby were blown out of the sky,[7] while 8 miles (13 km) away, half of the windows in Galveston were shattered.[8] The explosion blew almost 6,350 short tons (5,760 t) of the ship's steel into the air, some at supersonic speed.\n\nThe Monsanto Chemical Company plant adjacent to the slip where Grandcamp was docked suffered the brunt of the first explosion. Of its 574 employees and contractors, 234 were killed, and 200 more were injured. Every man of the Monsanto fire fighting team, which were laying hose reels opposite the Grandcamp, was killed.[2]: 37–38\n\nThe exact damage caused by the first explosion is not fully ascertainable, as the second explosion wreaked further havoc and came before a survey of the damage could be done.[2]: 38\n\nSeven ruptured oil tanks at the Republic Refinery began to burn, letting off thick clouds of black smoke.[2]: 39  Burning sulfur in a dockside warehouse created acrid fumes.[2]: 40\n\nOfficial casualty estimates came to a total of 567, including all the crewmen who remained aboard Grandcamp. All but one member of the 28-man Texas City volunteer fire department were killed in the initial explosion on the docks while fighting the shipboard fire. With fires raging throughout Texas City, first responders from other areas were initially unable to reach the site of the disaster.\n\nStill, 112 people within 500 ft (150 m) of the Grandcamp survived, including many witnesses who would allow for later reconstruction of the events.[2]: 37–38\n\nThe first explosion had set Highflyer free from its moorings, and it had drifted across the harbor, coming to rest against SS Wilson B. Keene. Her crew stayed aboard for an hour before the smoke of the burning oil and sulfur forced them to leave. In the afternoon, two men boarded Highflyer searching for injured crewmembers. They noted that her cargo was ablaze and reported it to someone on the harborfront. This message seems to have gone unheeded for several hours until it was realized that this indicated a serious problem. Only around 11 p.m. did tugboats attempt to pull Highflyer away from the docks. Despite having cut her anchor, they were unable to move her. They fled the area around 1 a.m. the next day (April 17). Ten minutes later, at 1:10 a.m., Highflyer exploded, killing two more people. According to witnesses, the explosion was more powerful than that of Grandcamp. Casualties were light since the docks had already been evacuated, but the second explosion exacerbated the damage to nearby ships and buildings. The blast destroyed the nearby Wilson B. Keene. The steel frame of Highflyer had been heated until glowing, and these chunks rained down upon Texas City setting mass fires.[2]: 4–5, 40–41  One of the propellers was blown off and subsequently found nearly a mile inland. It is now in a memorial park near the anchor of Grandcamp.\n\nThe Texas City disaster is generally considered the worst industrial accident in U.S. history. Witnesses compared the scene to the fairly recent images of the 1943 air raid on Bari and the much larger devastation after an atomic bomb was dropped at Nagasaki.\n\nOf the dead, 405 were identified and 63 have never been identified. The latter remains were placed in a memorial cemetery in the north part of Texas City near Moses Lake. An additional 113 people were classified as missing, for no identifiable parts were ever found. This figure includes firefighters who were aboard Grandcamp when she exploded. There is some speculation that there were hundreds more killed but uncounted, including visiting seamen, undocumented laborers and their families, and an untold number of travelers. More than 800 people were left orphaned or widowed.[2]: 6  However, there were also some survivors among people as close as 70 feet (21 m) from the dock. The victims' bodies quickly filled the local morgue. Several bodies were laid out in the local high school's gymnasium for identification by family or friends.\n\nMore than 5,000 people were injured, with 1,784 admitted to 21 area hospitals. More than 500 homes were destroyed and hundreds damaged, leaving 2,000 homeless. The seaport was destroyed, and many businesses were flattened or burned. Over 1,100 vehicles were damaged and 362 freight cars were obliterated; the property damage was estimated at $100 million[3] (equivalent to $1,100,000,000 in 2024). This number may not encompass the full scope of damage: a further $500 million of oil products burned (equivalent to $5,499,000,000 in 2024).\n\nA 2-short-ton (1.8-metric-ton) anchor of Grandcamp was hurled 1.62 miles (2.61 km) and found in a 10-foot (3 m) crater. It was installed at a memorial park. The other main 5-short-ton (4.5-metric-ton) anchor was hurled 1⁄2 mile (800 m) to the entrance of the Texas City Dike. It rests on a \"Texas-shaped\" memorial at the entrance. Burning wreckage ignited everything within miles, including dozens of oil and chemical tanks. The nearby city of Galveston was covered with an oily fog that left deposits over every exposed outdoor surface.\n\nSome of the deaths and damage in Texas City were due to the destruction and subsequent burning of several chemical plants (including Monsanto and Union Carbide), oil storage, and other facilities near the explosions. Twenty-seven of the twenty-eight members of Texas City's volunteer fire department and three of four members of the Texas City Heights Volunteer Fire Department who were on the docks near the burning ship were killed. One firefighter, Fred Dowdy, who had not responded to the initial call, coordinated other firefighters arriving from communities up to 60 miles (100 km) away. Alvin Fussell, sole survivor of the Heights Volunteer firefighters, was driving to work in Alvin when he heard of the fire on the radio. Eventually 200 firefighters arrived from as far away as Los Angeles. Fires resulting from the cataclysmic events were still burning a week after the disaster, and the process of body recovery took nearly a month. All four fire engines of Texas City were twisted and burned husks.\n\nThe cause of the initial fire on board Grandcamp was never determined. It may have been started by a cigarette discarded the previous day, meaning the ship's cargo had been smoldering throughout the night when the fire was discovered on the morning of the explosion.[1] Historian Hugh Stephens later identified human error as the cause, and cites numerous reasons as to why a minor fire became such a severe incident.[2]: 6\n\nStephens identifies as root causes the expansion of the port, the proximity of dangerous port operations to the rest of Texas City, a lack of community awareness of the danger posed by chemical hazards, and a lack of safety preparation.\n\nSmoking was commonplace at the time. While officially prohibited at the port, such prohibitions were not enforced and smoking was widespread.[2]: 28–29\n\nStephens notes that in interviews and written accounts, few residents of Texas City seemed to understand the danger of the port, as exemplified by the large crowd that assembled to watch the Grandcamp burn. Stephens suggests that in an era before disasters like Bhopal (1984), or Superfund legislation (1986), the sense of danger from chemicals was amorphous. \"Before the accident, Texas City's citizens felt secure because such a disaster had never happened and they could therefore assume it never would.\"[2]: 13  Stephens also points out that Texas City was a boomtown in a time when the rest of the country was still recovering from the Great Depression, in which most of the city owed its prosperity to the oil and chemical industry, which may have further led to lax attitudes.[2]: 14\n\nThe danger of ammonium nitrate may not have been well known at the time. While Army manuals classified it as a high explosive, general belief (and even guidance from the Department of Agriculture) held that fertilizer was not dangerous under typical conditions.[2]: 21–22  However, the danger was not unknown. The Port of Houston had forbidden the loading of fertilizer in 1946.[2]: 24\n\nIn the months before the disaster, local Catholic priest William F. Roach remarked on the concerning industrial conditions by stating \"I feel like I’m sitting on a keg of dynamite.\"[9]\n\nNeither the Port of Texas City, the Texas City Terminal Railway, the City itself, nor any of the oil refineries, had a disaster preparedness plan—which even at the time was regarded as inadequate.[2]: 13–14  The Port itself had no Port authority that could regulate both land and sea operations. Thus, safety was fragmented between companies and between land and sea. The end of military supervision at the end of the war also played a role. Safety authority should have transferred from the military back to the United States Coast Guard, but the Coast Guard failed to take preventative actions and safety instead returned to the hands of private parties.[2]: 16–17  Texas City also failed to police or regulate the dock; such matters were left to security hired by the Terminal Railway.[2]: 27\n\nThe disaster received national media attention, with offers of assistance coming from around the country. Several funds were established to handle donations, particularly the Texas City Relief Fund, created by the city's mayor Curtis Trahan.[2]: 104–105  One of the largest fundraising efforts for the city and the victims of the disaster was organized by Sam Maceo, one of the two brothers who ran organized crime in Galveston at the time. Maceo organized a large-scale benefit on the island, featuring entertainers including Phil Harris, Frank Sinatra, and Ann Sheridan.[2]: 104–105 [10] In the end, the Texas City Relief Fund raised more than $1 million ($15 million in today's terms). Payouts for fire insurance claims reached nearly $4 million ($55.7 million in today's terms).[2]: 104–105\n\nWithin days of the disaster, major companies that had lost facilities in the explosions announced plans to rebuild in Texas City and in some cases to expand their operations. Some companies implemented policies of retaining all of the hourly workers who had previously worked at destroyed facilities with plans to use them in the rebuilding. Cost estimates of the industrial reconstruction were estimated at approximately $100 million ($1.41 billion adjusted for inflation).[2]: 104–105\n\n\"Commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the explosion [...], just as the Phoenix bird symbolizes resurrection from the ashes of despair, the 'Phoenix Fountain' epitomizes courage and the triumph of the human spirit. [...] Chewelah, Washington Artist David Govedare was commissioned by Mayor Charles T. Doyle [...] [to] produce this twelve foot sculpture from half inch cor-ten steel. Architect Joseph Allen Hoover and City Engineer James McWhorter designed the fountain built by Texas City's Public Works Department.\"[11]\n\nMany of the legal cases seeking compensation were combined into Elizabeth Dalehite, et al. v. United States, under the recently enacted Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). On April 13, 1950, the district court found the United States government responsible for a litany of negligent acts of omission and commission by 168 named agencies and their representatives, in the manufacture, packaging, and labeling of ammonium nitrate. This was further compounded by errors in transport, storage, loading, fire prevention, and fire suppression, all of which led to the explosions and the subsequent carnage.\n\nOn June 10, 1952, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned this decision, finding that the United States maintained the right to exercise its own \"discretion\" in vital national matters. The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed that decision (346 U.S. 15, June 8, 1953), in a 4-to-3 opinion, noting that the district court had no jurisdiction under the federal statute to find the government liable for \"negligent planning decisions\" which were properly delegated to various departments and agencies. In short, the FTCA clearly exempts \"failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty\", and the court found that all of the alleged acts in this case were discretionary in nature.[12]\n\nIn its dissent, the three justices argued that, under the FTCA, \"Congress has defined the tort liability of the government as analogous to that of a private person\", i.e., when carrying out duties unrelated to governing. In this case, \"a policy adopted in the exercise of an immune discretion was carried out carelessly by those in charge of detail\", and that a private person would certainly be held liable for such acts. A private person is held to a higher standard of care when carrying out \"inherently dangerous\" acts such as transportation and storage of explosives.\n\nAccording to Melvin Belli in his book Ready for the Plaintiff! (1965), Congress acted to provide some compensation after the courts refused to do so.[13] The Dalehite decision was eventually \"appealed\" to Congress, where relief was granted by means of legislation (Public Law 378, 69 Stat. 707 (1955)).[14] When the last claim had been processed in 1957, 1,394 awards totaling nearly $17 million had been made.",

    "fullText": "A private jet crashed at a regional North Carolina airport and erupted into flames Thursday, killing seven people, including retired NASCAR star Greg Biffle and three members of his family, officials said.\n\nHere are some things to know about the crash.\n\nThe plane took off Thursday morning from Statesville Regional Airport, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of Charlotte. Shortly after takeoff, the jet turned back toward the airport and crashed while attempting to land, according to tracking data posted by FlightAware.com.\n\nVideo from WSOC-TV showed first responders rushing onto the runway, where flames burned near scattered wreckage.\n\nInvestigators have said it is too early to determine what caused the crash. There was some drizzle and clouds at the time, according to AccuWeather.\n\nStatesville Regional Airport offers corporate aviation facilities for Fortune 500 companies and several NASCAR teams, according to its website.\n\nAccording to a joint statement released by the victims' families, there were seven people aboard the plane, including Greg Biffle; his wife, Cristina Grossu Biffle; their son, Ryder; and Greg Biffle's daughter, Emma.\n\nThe statement identified the other victims as Craig Wadsworth, Dennis Dutton and Dutton's son, Jack, all “beloved by many in the NASCAR community.”\n\n“Each of them meant everything to us, and their absence leaves an immeasurable void in our lives,” the statement said.\n\nBiffle, 55, won more than 50 races across NASCAR’s three circuits, including 19 at the Cup Series level. He also won championships in both the lower-tier national Truck and Xfinity Series — the first driver to do so — and spent almost his entire career driving for Roush Fenway Racing, headquartered about 40 miles south of the crash site.\n\nWadsworth, a longtime behind-the-scenes employee with several NASCAR teams, was friends with Biffle and had helped him with odd jobs, including delivering supplies to places hit by Hurricane Helene a year ago, according to Wadsworth's roommate, Benito Howell.\n\nBiffle joins a somber roll of athletes who died in plane or helicopter crashes.\n\nThe plane was a Cessna C550, a popular mid-sized business jet with an excellent reputation, aviation safety expert Jeff Guzzetti said. Flight records show the plane was registered to a company run by Greg Biffle.\n\nThe plane was scheduled to fly to Sarasota, Florida, and then to Treasure Cay airport in the Bahamas before returning.\n\nBiffle's plane was built in 1981 and would have likely cost between $1 million and $10 million, depending on how it was outfitted, Guzzetti said. The Cessna 550 Citation has two engines and typically seats six to eight passengers.",

    "title": "Most millionaires don't consider themselves wealthy. So what does it really mean to be rich?",
    "description": "New data shows that having at least $1 million doesn’t necessarily mean you’re rich. Here’s what it really takes to feel financially secure today.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nJust one third (36%) of the nation’s wealthiest citizens — those with at least $1 million in investable assets — consider themselves wealthy, according to Northwestern Mutual’s 2025 Planning and Progress study.\n\nFurther, nearly half (49%) of American millionaires say their financial planning needs improvement, citing the possibility of outliving their savings, the impact of taxes in retirement, and potential long-term care needs as their top financial concerns.\n\nThis gap may be surprising, but it highlights how rising costs, longer lifespans, and shifting expectations have redefined what it means to feel rich in modern America.\n\nOne reason most millionaires don’t consider themselves wealthy is because our definition of wealth has changed over time.\n\n“Being a millionaire used to mean you had done really well and ‘made it,’” said Tom Mathews, CFEd, CPA, and author of \"How Money Works.\" “Today, it really just means you’ve crossed an outdated line.”\n\nMathews explained the problem isn’t necessarily that people have less money today, but rather, they have less certainty and control around their finances. “Things like inflation, rising taxes, market volatility, and the escalating cost of housing, healthcare, and education have changed what financial security feels like,” he said. “A million dollars on paper doesn’t stretch the way it used to, especially when most of that net worth is tied up in illiquid assets like homes, retirement accounts, or businesses.”\n\nThere’s also the issue of longevity. With people living longer, a seven-figure portfolio may not seem substantial when it’s expected to fund decades of living expenses and rising medical costs.\n\nIn other words, Mathews said, many people might look wealthy on paper, but that doesn’t mean they feel financially secure.\n\nIf millionaires don’t necessarily feel wealthy, what does it take to feel rich in today’s economy?\n\nAccording to Charles Schwab’s 2025 Modern Wealth Survey, Americans need an average net worth of $839,000 to be financially comfortable, and $2.3 million to feel wealthy.\n\nAdditionally, 63% of survey respondents said it feels like it takes more money to be wealthy today when compared with last year, citing the impact of inflation (73%), a worsened economy (62%), and higher taxes (48%) as the top reasons.\n\nBut experts say feeling wealthy isn’t just about how much money you have. The key is achieving true financial security.\n\n“The real takeaway is that wealth is no longer about accumulation. It’s about confidence,” Mathews said. “Confidence comes from education, strategy, and structure.” He added that when people understand how money works, they stop guessing or reacting to headlines and start making more informed decisions. “That’s when wealth finally feels like wealth,” he said.\n\nReaching true financial security is a personal journey; everyone has their own idea of what that looks like. However, there are financial moves you can make to improve your financial situation and feel more secure.\n\nCreate a clear financial plan: The Northwestern Mutual Study found that millionaires are much more likely to report higher levels of financial discipline, confidence, and clarity than the average American. Having a clear understanding of your budget, financial goals, and long-term wealth-building strategy can make you feel more confident in your future.\n\nPrioritize paying off debt and saving more: Your net worth is a key indicator of your financial health. And the formula for improving your net worth is fairly simple: Increase what you own (assets) and decrease what you owe (debts). That’s why it’s smart to prioritize paying down debt and increasing your savings to build a higher net worth over time.\n\nSeek help from a professional: There’s no shame in asking for help. In fact, according to the survey, millionaires are more than twice as likely to work with a financial advisor than the general public (74% vs. 34%, respectively). Consulting a professional can help you better understand your finances and create a plan with your specific goals in mind.\n\nLearn the difference between cash and cash equivalents, plus examples and when these low-risk options make sense for savers.\n\nYour personal cash burn rate shows how fast you spend money each month. Learn how to calculate it and use it to protect your savings.\n\nThese AI tools for freelancers can help you run a more efficient business. Because as a freelancer, more free time can mean more money in your bank account.\n\nThe Beige Book, a report published by the Federal Reserve, gathers real-world business insights and helps guide future Fed policy decisions.\n\nHow many millionaires are there in America, and how can you join their ranks? Here’s a closer look at millionaires in the U.S. and their financial habits.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is easing some federal restrictions on marijuana.\n\nTrump signed an executive order on Thursday that will reclassify marijuana to a Schedule III drug, putting it on par with drugs like ketamine and anabolic steroids.\n\n\"We have people begging for me to do this, people that are in great pain,\" Trump said during an event in the Oval Office, flanked by several doctors.\n\nThe order falls short of fully legalizing marijuana, but it will make it easier for researchers to study the drug.\n\nTrump said that he had been lobbied to make the change by people with extreme pain, incurable diseases, and seizure disorders, among others. The president noted the substance's medical uses, including as a \"substitute for addictive and potentially lethal opioid painkillers.\"\n\nThe move could also bring tax relief to marijuana businesses operating in states that have already legalized the substance.\n\nMarijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug, a category for substances with \"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse,\" according to the Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\nSchedule III drugs, on the other hand, have a \"moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.\"\n\nMarijuana stocks surged last week amid widespread rumors of Trump's impending order. Most of the sector's most prominent names continued trending upward with this week on mounting speculation for the pro-cannabis policy decision.\n\nNews of Trump signing the executive order continued to boost the industry's biggest players. Tilray Brands, typically seen as a leader among cannabis stocks, jumped 6% today while Aurora Cannabis rose 9% and Canopy Growth Corporation spiked 11%.\n\nThese cannabis stocks are all relatively small cap and are prone to price swings, but the signing of an executive order is a highly bullish catalyst for the industry.\n\nAs he campaigned for a third time in 2024, Trump signaled that he would take a friendlier approach toward marijuana than he did during his first term.\n\n\"I promised to be the president of common sense, and that is exactly what we're doing,\" Trump said on Thursday.\n\nHe said that he would vote for a ballot measure in Florida aimed at legalizing marijuana for recreational use in the state. That measure garnered 56% of the vote but ultimately fell short of the 60% required for passage.\n\nTrump also said in 2024 that he supported enacting laws to make it easier for marijuana businesses to operate.",

    "fullText": "The nation's largest HR trade group has been sued by a woman who alleges it revoked a job offer because it didn't want her medical service dog in the office.\n\nThe lawsuit filed Tuesday by Fiona Torres against the Society for Human Resource Management says she is diabetic, and the dog can detect changes in her blood-sugar levels faster and more reliably than a top-tier glucose monitor.\n\nSHRM says it \"fully complied\" with the Americans with Disabilities Act in offering Torres an alternative \"reasonable accommodation\" for her health condition.\n\nTorres' lawsuit was filed less than two weeks after SHRM was ordered to pay $11.5 million in an unrelated race discrimination and retaliation case.\n\nThe new complaint alleges that in June 2024, SHRM offered Torres a role as a senior specialist in its product management department at its office in Alexandria, Virginia, then revoked the offer in July because she wanted to bring her dog to work.\n\nTorres said SHRM's offer to accommodate her medical needs was to allow her to keep food, water, and an insulin pump at her desk, which she felt was insufficient.\n\n\"I was ready and able to work,\" Torres said in an email to Business Insider through her attorney. \"They said they were eager to have me until they found out I had a disability and a service dog.\"\n\nThe complaint quotes an email from SHRM to Torres denying her accommodation request.\n\n\"[I]t does not appear there are any reasonable accommodations that would allow you to perform the essential functions of the role,\" SHRM wrote, according to the complaint.\n\nSHRM spokesman Eddie Burke declined to comment on the specifics of the suit, saying the organization was still reviewing the legal papers.\n\n\"We support the ADA and are actively committed to supporting employees through fair, respectful, and legally compliant accommodation processes,\" he said. \"We fully complied with the ADA in this matter and, in consultation with outside legal counsel, met all of our obligations to provide reasonable accommodations to Fiona Torres.\"\n\nLori Kisch, a lawyer for Torres, told Business Insider that SHRM's alleged conduct was \"ironic\" given that it provides information and resources to help HR professionals follow laws such as the ADA.\n\n\"They can't argue that they don't understand the law, and their actions are a reckless indifference to the law,\" she said.\n\nTorres' case, filed in federal court in Virginia, follows a lawsuit brought by a former SHRM employee that alleged race discrimination and retaliation. Rehab Mohamed, a Black and Egyptian instructional designer, claimed her SHRM manager held her to higher standards than white employees. A jury found SHRM liable for $11.5 million in damages.\n\nSHRM has said it plans to file an appeal and that the verdict \"does not reflect the facts, the law, or the truth of how\" it operates.",

Winterfest is here, and that means lots of free stuff. As has become tradition in Fortnite, Epic Games has brought back the Winterfest Cabin, which is full of free cosmetics waiting to be opened.\n\nThere are 14 free gifts available in the cabin, and you can open one each day. In past years, these gifts would stack--if you missed a day, you'd be able to open two the following day. But it doesn't work that way this year. This time, you really can only open one present each day, no matter what. So be sure to keep up with them, or else you might miss out on some of the gifts.\n\nAs you can see from the graphic, this year's collection of gifts includes two free skins, two back blings, two pickaxes, two musical instruments, a glider, a weapon wrap, a Fortnite-original jam track based on Carol of the Bells, a contrail, and a few sprays and emoticons for good measure.\n\nThe skins are in the two large presents in the back on the left side of the room, but you won't be able to open them at the start. You can unlock the Glacial Dummy skin after opening seven other presents, which means he'll be available on Christmas day, And you can get Cheeks, the hamster man, only after you've picked every other present, which means he'll unlock on New Year's Eve.\n\nBeyond those two skins, you can unlock the presents in any order you want. And despite the fact there's a Hogwarts student chilling in the cabin while the Harry Potter movie theme plays, none of the free gifts have anything to do with the Harry Potter franchise.\n\nFor a better look at some of the free rewards, as pulled by fortnite.gg, you can pull from this year's Winterfest Cabin, scroll on.

    "description": "As a frequent flyer, there are things I'd never do in an airport lounge, such as sleeping or stuffing my face at the buffet.",
    "fullText": "I travel often — at least once a month — and I like having access to Delta Sky Clubs through my co-branded Delta credit card and Priority Pass, a membership that gets me into more than 1,500 airport lounges worldwide.\n\nThese two programs usually allow me to find a lounge I can use regardless of the airport I'm at or the airline I'm flying.\n\nI enjoy using airport lounges because they're usually quieter and less crowded than waiting at the gate. I also like having access to a nicer, less-crowded restroom, and of course, the complimentary food and beverages are pretty sweet, too.\n\nAs a frequent traveler, here are five things I never do in an airport lounge.\n\nMost airport lounges have a variety of seating, from desk-like workspaces with electrical outlets to comfortable upholstered couches you might find in a living room.\n\nI don't pick the first open seat I see unless the lounge is super crowded and I feel as if it's my only option. Fortunately, I can usually gauge how crowded a lounge is by the presence of a line at the entry.\n\nA lot of lounges I've visited don't allow new visitors when they're close to capacity, so finding a seat is usually not an issue.\n\nIf I'm not familiar with a lounge's layout, I'll take a lap to see all the available seating. I love a comfortable chair with built-in USB ports so I can charge my phone, so I'll look for that type of seating first.\n\nI also like to sit away from the buffet, bar, and restrooms so I can have as quiet an atmosphere as possible.\n\nFood varies widely from lounge to lounge, from chef-curated menus to bowls of trail mix and grab-and-go snacks, but there are typically plenty of hot food offerings.\n\nThey can be tempting, but I don't have that \"it's free, and it's there\" mentality, so I won't load up my plate unless I'm starving or know I won't be eating for a while. I don't want to feel too full or bloated before a long flight.\n\nThe bar is always a happening spot for travelers, but I take it easy on the alcohol some lounges give out for free.\n\nI might have a drink once in a while, but I don't want to get dehydrated before a long flight or lose my inhibitions to the point where I'm not watching my belongings or the time.\n\nEven if I'm tired and a lounge has comfy, reclining chairs, I don't sleep in airport lounges. I'm always too nervous I'll miss my flight.\n\nI've never had a lengthy layover during which I was that exhausted, plus most lounges have time limits on how long people can be inside them.\n\nGetting off my feet and relaxing is usually enough of a break if I'm tired.\n\nUnless a lounge is virtually empty, I don't take up more than one seat or put my backpack on its own chair. I get frustrated when I'm looking for a seat, but many are unavailable because people are using them as storage.\n\nUsing headphones is also a cardinal rule in airport lounges, although I often see people being inconsiderate by streaming or using FaceTime without them.\n\nI also wouldn't engage in some behaviors I see in lounges that I find gross, such as removing shoes to put bare feet on airport furniture or taking care of personal grooming — like clipping nails — outside a restroom.\n\nLounges provide a comfortable, home-like environment, but I try to remember that they are public spaces. I wish other people would, too.\n\nI love having lounge access, but I won't leave my flight's terminal to seek one out unless my layover is at least two hours long.\n\nEven then, I hesitate to go unless I'm familiar with the airport. I never want to miss a flight just because I wanted some extra comfort before it.\n\nThis story was originally published on July 25, 2024, and most recently updated on December 18, 2025.",

    "fullText": "A Kansas tribe said it has walked away from a nearly $30 million federal contract to come up with preliminary designs for immigrant detention centers after facing a wave of online criticism.\n\nThe Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation 's announcement Wednesday night came just over a week after the economic development leaders who brokered the deal with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement were fired.\n\nWith some Native Americans swept up and detained in recent ICE raids, the deal was derided online as “disgusting” and “cruel.\" Many in Indian Country also questioned how a tribe whose own ancestors were uprooted two centuries ago from the Great Lakes region and corralled on a reservation south of Topeka could participate in the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts.\n\nTribal Chairman Joseph “Zeke” Rupnick nodded to the historic issues last week in a video address that called reservations \"the government’s first attempts at detention centers.” In an update Wednesday, he announced that he was “happy to share that our Nation has successfully exited all third-party related interests affiliated with ICE.”\n\nThe Prairie Band Potawatomi has a range of businesses that provide health care management staffing, general contracting and even interior design. And Rupnick said in his latest address that tribal officials plan to meet in January about how to ensure “economic interests do not come into conflict with our values in the future.”\n\nA tribal offshoot hired by ICE — KPB Services LLC — was established in April in Holton, Kansas, by Ernest C. Woodward Jr., a former naval officer who markets himself as a “go-to” adviser for tribes and affiliated companies seeking to land federal contracts.\n\nThe Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation said in 2017 that Woodward’s firm advised it on its acquisition of another government contractor, Mill Creek LLC, which specializes in outfitting federal buildings and the military with office furniture and medical equipment.\n\nWoodward also is listed as the chief operating officer of the Florida branch of Prairie Band Construction Inc., which was registered in September.\n\nAttempts to locate Woodward were unsuccessful. A spokesperson for KPB said Woodward is no longer with the LLC but she declined to say whether he was terminated. Woodward did not respond to an email sent to another consulting firm he’s affiliated with, Virginia-based Chinkapin Partners LLC.\n\nA spokesperson for the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation said the tribe divested from KPB. While that company still has the contract, “Prairie Band no longer has a stake,” the spokesperson said.\n\nThe spokesperson said Woodward is no longer with the tribe's limited liability corporation, but she declined to say whether he was terminated.\n\nThe ICE contract initially was awarded in October for $19 million for unspecified “due diligence and concept designs” for processing centers and detention centers throughout the U.S., according to a one-sentence description of the work on the federal government’s real-time contracting database. It was modified a month later to increase the payout ceiling to $29.9 million.\n\nSole-source contracts above $30 million require additional justification under federal contracting rules.\n\nTribal leaders and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security haven’t responded to detailed questions about why the firm was selected for such a big contract without having to compete for the work as federal contracting normally requires. It’s also unclear what the Tribal Council knew about the contract.\n\n“That process of internal auditing is really just beginning,” the tribal spokesperson said.\n\nHollingsworth reported from Mission, Kansas, and Goodman from Miami.",

The U.S. support for ‘Taiwan Independence’ through arms will only end up backfiring. Using Taiwan to contain China will not succeed.\"\n\nU.S. officials have not yet detailed delivery timelines, but the sale reflects Washington’s push to accelerate Taiwan’s defenses amid growing concern over China’s military pressure campaign. The HIMARS and ATACMS combination is expected to draw particular attention from Beijing because it would allow Taiwan to target PLA staging areas, ships and infrastructure from mobile launchers, a capability China has repeatedly warned against.\n\nIn its notification to Congress, the State Department said the proposed sales would advance \"U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient’s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.\"\n\nThe department added that the weapons would \"help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance and economic progress in the region.\"\n\nUnder longstanding U.S. policy, Washington provides Taiwan with arms it deems necessary for the island’s self-defense while maintaining a \"One China\" policy and not supporting a declaration of formal independence. China argues that any enhancement of Taiwan’s defenses encourages separatism, while U.S. officials say the purpose of such sales is to preserve stability and deter conflict.\n\nHigh Stakes On The High Seas As Us, China Test Limits Of Military Power\n\nThe package now enters a 30-day congressional review period, during which lawmakers could file a resolution attempting to block it, a step Congress has never taken for an arms sale to Taiwan. Once the review period ends, contracting and production begin, a process that typically stretches over several years and contributes to a backlog that once reached $20 billion in undelivered U.S. weapons Taiwan has already purchased.\n\nChina has a track record of responding to major Taiwan arms sales with military demonstrations, including large-scale PLA drills, increased air and naval activity near the island and sanctions on U.S. defense firms. Analysts say Beijing’s sharp rhetoric suggests additional military signaling is likely, though China did not immediately announce specific countermeasures.\n\nThe latest sale marks a significant boost to Taiwan’s conventional firepower. In recent months, Beijing has stepped up pressure across the strait with near-daily PLA air and naval patrols, record incursions around the island and high-profile exercises meant to signal its ability to encircle Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan’s Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung thanked the U.S. Wednesday for its \"long-term support for regional security and Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities,\" which he said are key to deterring a conflict in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nOriginal article",

    "description": "Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released new photos from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, including some showing him with powerful people.",
    "fullText": "Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released a new batch of photos obtained from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, with some featuring tech titans Bill Gates and Sergey Brin.\n\nThe latest batch comes ahead of the December 19 deadline for the Justice Department to release its own Epstein-related files through the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Thursday's release marks the latest documents the committee has made public from the files it obtained from the Epstein estate through a subpoena earlier this year.\n\nInclusion in the photos isn't an indication of wrongdoing, and some of the pics appear to have been taken at a conference attended by other business professionals.\n\nEpstein — who killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex-trafficking charges, and who in 2008 pleaded guilty to a lesser sexual offense — has long been the subject of conspiracy theories.\n\nHe amassed a fortune worth over $600 million at the time of his death and maintained ties with some of the most powerful people in the world, including President Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Steve Bannon, and the former Prince Andrew.\n\nThe relationship between Gates and Epstein has been known for years.\n\nThey met several times — Gates has said the meetings were about philanthropy — and had ties to some of the same people. Epstein sought to establish a philanthropic organization funded by Gates and housed at JPMorgan Chase, a project that never came to fruition.\n\nEpstein has also named Boris Nikolic, a former advisor to Gates, as a backup executor for his estate.\n\nIn the past, Gates has said that he \"made a mistake in judgment\" when asked about his relationship with the pedophile, calling it \"foolish\" in an interview with the Journal this year.\n\nThe House Oversight's document dump did not say when or where the photos were taken or the identities of the women in the photos.\n\nThe billionaire has appeared in the Oversight Committee's Epstein releases before: In September, an email was released that included Epstein's 2014 schedule, which listed a \"tentative breakfast party w/Bill Gates.\"\n\nEarlier this month, a photo was released of Gates with one of Epstein's pilots.\n\nA representative for Gates did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment about the new photos.\n\nEpstein, who maintained a deep relationship with JPMorgan Chase, referred Google cofounder Sergey Brin to the bank as a client in 2004. He later connected Brin with members of the bank who could advise the tech billionaire on tax issues.\n\nSome of the photos of Brin appear to have been taken at events organized by The Edge, a now-dormant organization that arranged conferences about ideas. Epstein also attended some of these events.\n\nIn the foreground of one of the photos, Brin appears with New York Times columnist David Brooks.\n\nA representative for Brin did not immediately respond to a request for comment to Business Insider about the photographs.\n\nA spokesperson for Brooks said the journalist attended the event in 2011 \"to speak with noted and important business leaders to inform his columns.\"\n\n\"Mr. Brooks had no contact with him before or after this single attendance at a widely-attended dinner,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nSalar Kamangar, an early Google employee and later the CEO of YouTube, was also featured in Thursday's photo drop. He appeared to be photographed at the same 2011 event as Brin and Brooks.\n\nNeither Kamangar nor representatives for Google immediately responded to Business Insider's request for comment about the new photos.",

    "description": "A Kennedy Center Board member accused the White House of lying about the vote to change the center's name to the Trump Kennedy Center.",
    "fullText": "A Kennedy Center board member accused the White House of lying about the organization’s “unanimous” vote to change the center’s name to the “Trump-Kennedy Center,” claiming that her dissent was censored.\n\nOn Thursday, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that the Trump-controlled board “voted unanimously” for the name change. Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), who sits on the center’s board, posted a video to X after the announcement making it clear that she was on the call when the decision was made and was muted so she could not voice her dissenting opinion.\n\n“What you may hear is that there was a unanimous vote to rename the Kennedy Center the Trump Center,” Beatty said. “Be clear, I was on that call and as I tried to push my button to voice my concern, to ask questions, and certainly not to vote in support of this, I was muted. Each time I tried to speak I was muted. Participants were not allowed to voice their concerns who were online yet it was said at the end it was a unanimous vote.”\n\nFor the record. This was not unanimous. I was muted on the call and not allowed to speak or voice my opposition to this  move. Also for the record, this was not on the agenda. This was not consensus. This is censorship. https://t.co/D1zGV7xiWV pic.twitter.com/npNvSIy6sV\n\n— Rep. Joyce Beatty (@RepBeatty) December 18, 2025\n\nShe continued: “Clearly, the Congress has a say in this. This center – the Kennedy Center – was created by the Congress. I think it is important for us to know that this is just another attempt to evade the law, and not let the people have a say.”\n\nThe president named himself a chairman of the Kennedy Center earlier this year after taking office. He hinted at the name change in October in a Truth Social post.\n\nThe proposal to change the name of the center to the Trump-Kennedy Center was also lambasted online by members of President John F. Kennedy’s family on Thursdasy.\n\n“Perhaps the board isn’t aware that the Kennedy Center is the memorial to the president of the United States, John F. Kennedy,” Tim Shriver, JFK’s nephew, wrote on X. “Would they rename the Lincoln Memorial? The Jefferson? That would be an insult to great presidents. This too is an insult to a great president.”\n\nPerhaps the board isn’t aware that the Kennedy Center is 𝗧𝗛𝗘 memorial to the president of the United States, John F. Kennedy.

Kennedy,” Shriver, JFK’s niece, wrote. “It was named in his honor. He was a man who was interested in the arts, interested in culture, interested in education, language, history. He brought the arts into the White House, and he and my Aunt Jackie amplified the arts, celebrated the arts, stood up for the arts and artists.”\n\nThe Kennedy Center was named after my uncle, President John F Kennedy.

It is beyond wild that he would think adding his name in front of President Kennedy’s name is acceptable. It is not.”\n\nJoe Kennedy III added that altering the Kennedy Center could “no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says.”\n\nIn July, House Republican’s introduced a bill that aimed to strip former President Kennedy’s name from the center, turning it into the Trump Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nThe center’s name change was part of legislation introduced by Rep. Bob Onder (R-Missouri) called the Make Entertainment Great Again (MEGA) Act. Onder noted in his bill proposal that Trump was intended “to preserve the integrity of the fine arts by ending woke programming and rebalancing the Kennedy Center’s $234 million budget” since being elected chairman.\n\nThe post Kennedy Center Board Member Says Opposition to Trump Renaming Was Censored as JFK Family Condemns Move: ‘An Insult’ appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "title": "The 12 comfiest sweatsuits for women that feel cozy and put-together",
    "description": "I did the hard work of testing the best and comfiest sweatsuits for women, and these are the winners.",
    "fullText": "If it takes 10,000 hours to become an \"expert\" at something, then I'm easily an expert at wearing sweatsuits. I tomy career fully remote five years ago, I've amassed no less than 22 sweatsuits which comprise my daily uniform. The best matching sweatsuits I've tried look more put together than separates, so I can transition from my home office to running errands and back again without any outfit changes.\n\nMy favorite sweatsuit comes from Spanx (more specifically, the Air Essentials Wide-Leg Pants and Half-Zip Sweatshirt). It's made with a lightweight, luxurious-feeling fabric (though I found the Anrabess Women's 2-Piece Sweatsuit to be a solid alternative at a fraction of the price). I'm also a huge fan of Gap's VintageSoft Boyfriend Joggers and Raglan Sweatshirt. They're warm, cozy, and come in tons of fun colors (which is why I bought three!).\n\nI remember the first time I put on Spanx's AirEssentials sweatsuit and quickly understood the hype (our own editors and Oprah are big fans). The fabric felt luxurious, stretchy and super soft. It remains one of the comfiest things I've ever had on my body.\n\nThough the pants come in petite and long inseams, Spanx recommends the regular length for someone 5-foot-7. So I selected the Wide-Leg Pants in a size Medium, with a Half-Zip sweatshirt in a size Small. Both fit me impeccably.\n\nI wear the whole set with crisp, white sneakers and oversized sunglasses, and the finished look is downright fancy. That's a feeling I usually find difficult to achieve in sweats. Another little bonus is that the fabric offers UPF 50+ protection.\n\n\"What sets this sweater apart is its oversized silhouette, which lends it a more intentional, wearable shape than any other sweatshirt. It drapes beautifully, and the ribbed hem and banded cuffs add just enough structure to keep it from feeling boxy. Though the crewneck sweater that I'm wearing above is sold out, there's still lots of stock in the V-neck version.\n\nGap's CashSoft Boot Sweater Pants are perhaps my favorite piece in the whole CashSoft line. The boot-cut silhouette is the real differentiator here: instead of the straight or jogger shape most sweat pants default to, this cut elongates the leg and balances out bulkier winter tops. It gives the pants a more \"finished\" look, almost like a soft-knit version of trousers. Plus, it helps that these are available in both petite and tall lengths so that you can get the perfect fit.\n\nAs someone who has always switched between leggings, jeans, and sweatpants for cozy weekend days, this pant beats all of them in comfort, warmth, and style. I'm planning to purchase it in both black and white, so I can pair it with almost anything.\" —Samantha Crozier, style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nRead \n\n\"These are the ultimate cold weather sweatpants. They feel so warm and cozy, and the fleece interior is baby soft. Aesthetically inspired by track pants, the Beyond Yoga sweats are sporty chic, with a cute split hem at the bottom is a cute sporty touch and retro contrast piping trim down the side of the legs. While the fit is somewhat relaxed, the pants are form-fitting, with a mid-rise waist and an ever-so-slight flare. I'm not normally a matching-set girlie, but I felt very cool wearing these with the matching LuxeFleece Piper Oversized Sweatshirt.\" — Maria Yagoda, freelance writer, Insider Reviews\n\nOther styles from Beyond Yoga come in a wider size range. Learn \n\nThough the design on this Gap pullover and jogger set is classic, the quality is top-notch. The fabric is cozy and warm, though not overly so. The fit is roomy but not oversized, making it perfect for layering. I love that the top and bottom are sold separately and both come in three lengths.\n\nIf I truly love something in my wardrobe, I'm the type of person who will buy two. Rarely, though, do I buy three of a kind, but I did with this sweatsuit because I reached for it so often. (Actually, it's four if you count the set I gifted my sister for Christmas.) It's easy to load up because there are lots of vibrant and neutral colors to choose from, and Gap is regularly adding new ones to the mix.\n\nThis is Amazon's number one best-seller in women's tracksuits for good reason. The stretchy, silky-soft, medium-weight fabric is much more expensive-looking than I anticipated. I chose a rich, dark brown color called Coffee. When I opened the zippered plastic bag it came in, it was exactly the hue I expected. I also love that the top looks equally stylish with leggings or jeans.\n\nStill, I should note that this is sold as a set, so it's not ideal for people who (like me) size differently in tops and bottoms. Still, if you're looking for a budget-friendly option that looks luxe, it's hard to beat this price.\n\nRead \n\nI'm a long-time fan of Vuori's elevated athleisure, and I regularly pack items from the brand when I'm traveling. Their Restore fleece collection might be my favorite yet. The French terry fabric is nice and warm without feeling too heavy. I appreciate that the hoodie has a half zip, making it easier to pull over my head without messing up my hair and allowing me to adjust the warmth. The bottoms have multiple design details that set them apart from your basic sweatpants: a pintuck down the front, exposed ties and a stitched logo on the back.\n\nI chose the Chia colorway, which is a versatile mauvy-brown. The fit is true to size with a slightly oversized silhouette that is roomy but not baggy. I just wish there were length options for the joggers like there are with the Performance joggers I love so much.\n\nAs far as textiles are concerned, Buck Mason stands above the competition. Home to some of our favorite basic t-shirts, the brand makes equally notable athleisure. The 100% cotton jersey sweats are designed to retain their shape, despite washing or napping in them. They come pre-washed, too, giving them a lived-in feel from the first wear (this time it was at the nail salon, where I immediately got a compliment). The mid-weight fabric is airy yet substantial — a perfect combination for comfort.\n\nI tend to be in-between size, so I went up in these but wished I had sized down instead. The fit is generously oversized. Still, they look more polished than your typical sweats, especially the mockneck top.\n\nAthleta makes my favorite work pants that feel like sweatpants. Recently, I sampled their Seasoft sweats, and (no surprise here) I was thoroughly pleased.\n\nThis lightweight Athleta sweatsuit is great for warmer months thanks to a breathable, machine-washable fabric and breezy silhouette. While it's equally great for lounging or running errands, this would definitely be the sweatsuit I choose for sportier activities, like a long walk outdoors. It's also ideal for travel since the material is wrinkle-resistant. I'm especially enamored with the quarter-zip top, which has stylish ribbed detailing around the zipper. I also love that the bottom hem has a drawcord to adjust the fit.\n\n\"This $220 sweatsuit is the best investment I've made as a working mom. I can do school drop-off without having to get fully dressed,\" writes deputy editor Conz Preti in her review of the pima cotton outfit sold as a two-piece set. \"I got the lavender color set that has an accent of red on the sleeves. The cotton is super soft and light, and the look is relaxed — which I strive to be in the mornings rushing out the door.\n\n\"I can wear the sweatsuit with sneakers or rain boots, and as the days get colder, I can easily throw a jacket on top. Because of the relaxed look, I can wear anything underneath, like a tee or a tank top. I've gotten lots of compliments from other moms at school, and I'm always happy to share my secret.\"\n\nNothing compares to being enveloped in an extra oversized sweatsuit. Lululemon's oversized Scuba set delivers on that front. Still, I don't feel like I'm swimming in it, thanks to the sweatshirt's cropped waist. My favorite details are the sweatshirt's gold zipper and large stitched logo on the hood. They elevate it from a typical sweatshirt, making me more inclined to wear it out when I'm running errands.\n\nI was a little unsure of what size to pick in the top since the sizes are grouped XS/S, M/L and XL/XXL. I'm usually between a small and a medium, so I sized up to M/L, but in retrospect, I would have been happier with the XS/S. I mistakenly sized up in the bottoms, too, but shouldn't have due to the already oversized fit.\n\nOn the coldest days, I reach for a sweatsuit from Athleta's Forever Fleece collection — its warmth is unrivaled. The plush fleece has a soft, brushed interior that has the perfect amount of stretch for comfort. Still, it's adequately breathable.\n\nThe sweatshirt is a generous 28 inches long, which adds warmth and lets it pair well with leggings. Both the half-zip sweatshirt and the high-rise joggers are liberally oversized, which works well if you plan on layering clothes underneath. If I had to do it over, I might have preferred to size down, though.\n\nIf you haven't heard of Popflex, you've certainly heard of one highly notable fan: Taylor Swift. It's been heavily speculated that the \"lilac short skirt\" Swift sings about in \"imgonnagetyouback\" is the Popflex Pirouette Skirt, so we simply had to check out the inclusive activewear brand for ourselves.\n\nOne of our favorite pieces is this ingeniously designed zipped hoodie, which pairs perfectly with these versatile sweats with a high- or low-rise waist depending on how you roll them.\n\n\"The hoodie is more fitted at the hips than at the waist, which produces a bubbled-over look rather than hanging straight down like most zip hoodies. The sleeves are similarly bubbled at the wrists, so the look is oversized but still fitted. I love the slightly off-the-shoulder opening and the materials are supersoft,\" writes deputy editor Lauren Savoie. \"The 1X/3X is generously sized; I usually wear a 3X and I felt like I had plenty of extra room in the hoodie.\"\n\nRead our full Popflex review to learn more about our favorite styles.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

    "description": "The Coldplay \"kiss cam\" led to harassment for Kristin Cabot, the woman in the video, she says. That should make us all feel bad about the internet.",
    "fullText": "I still feel bad about watching the Coldplay \"kiss cam\" video.\n\nAfter the woman who was caught in the embarrassing moment spoke this week about harassment she endured when the video went viral over the summer … well, I think we should all feel bad.\n\nThis wasn't any of our business. And our reaction to the video says a lot more about us, and about online culture, than it could ever say about the people who were filmed embracing.\n\nI think we can agree that a potential romance between a CEO and an underling isn't appropriate. But the extreme reactions to the video — being doxxed, getting 500 to 600 calls a day, and 50 to 60 death threats, she told The New York Times — weren't about workplace conduct or potential relationship transgressions.\n\nKristin Cabot also spoke to the Times of London this week. She told the newspaper that she might have understood all the attention had she been famous. \"But I'm not some celebrity, I'm just a mom from New Hampshire,\" she told the newspaper. \"Even if I did have an affair, it's not anybody's business.\"\n\nExactly. Everyone, chill. Don't find some random person on the internet and call them at home and yell at them. Come on.\n\nWhen it comes to the idea of the internet doxxing and harassing people, we imagine something like 4chan, or some anonymous sinister force victimizing some innocent person for political or ideological reasons. But what Cabot is describing isn't 4chan trolls. It's people at her local grocery store, and people willing to say mean things using their real names and faces.\n\nThere's a long history of \"the internet\" grabbing onto some viral moment with a stranger and hanging them out to dry. Think of \"West Elm Caleb,\" a man whom several women on TikTok realized they had all met on dating apps. Or \"Couch Guy,\" a young man who TikTok was convinced was cheating on his girlfriend in a viral video. Online mobs doxxed and harassed them in real life.\n\nWhat always felt off to me about the \"kiss cam\" story was that, sure, it was a funny little viral moment. Haha. I watched it and thought it was amusing for a second. But the way it blew up got weird. It became a big national news story. (We covered it at Business Insider, and I wrote about it, too.) It should've been a gag for 2 hours; instead, it made headlines for days.\n\nWe should feel bad that this got so out of control! Yes, I laughed at the video. No, I didn't feel compelled to use facial recognition software to identify the people in it, nor did I tweet at them or call them at home. But some jerks actually did that! And my harmless chuckling eventually led to a cascade of real-world harm to someone who didn't live a public life and whose crime was a dismissible case of misdemeanor canoodling.\n\nIn the interview with The New York Times, Cabot talks about how she's taken accountability for her actions and accepted the consequences of losing her job. We, the internet mob, should do the same: take accountability for being a small part of something that snowballed way out of control.\n\nIf you find yourself fiending for a healthy outlet for messy gossip and drama that you can yell about online, there is an endless buffet for you awaiting on Bravo and ESPN. Let 2026 find you at peace.",

    "fullText": "Erebor Bank, Palmer Luckey's finance startup backed by some of the biggest names in tech, got one step closer to launching after it cleared another key federal hurdle this week.\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. approved Erebor on December 16 with conditions: The bank is subject to a strict capitalization requirement and must have investors ready to provide more funding if called upon.\n\nThe bank still requires final approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. It received preliminary approval from the OCC in October.\n\nTodd Baker, a senior fellow at Columbia University and a consultant to fintech companies who isn't involved with Erebor, said in an email that he would expect Erebor to get approval to open in early 2026.\n\nBaker said in an email that one of the FDIC's requirements — that the bank invoke a capital-call agreement that would require unnamed parties to chip in more cash if certain triggers occur — is \"highly unusual\" but \"entirely appropriate given the expectation that the bank will be taking on significant risks associated with its tech and crypto-focused business plan.\"\n\nA lawyer listed in regulatory documents as an Erebor spokesperson didn't reply to a comment request.\n\nWith funding from Joe Lonsdale and Peter Thiel, Erebor's valuation was reported to be about $2 billion earlier this year. Regulatory documents showed that the bank has brought on talent from both Luckey's tech circles as well as bank and bank-regulatory circles; earlier this month, a cryptocurrency event featured remarks by Erebor's Suzanne Dannheim, a former Goldman Sachs employee.\n\nErebor's founding team set out an ambitious timeline in its pitch to investors. The bank stressed founder Palmer Luckey's \"political network\" — he has contributed large sums to President Donald Trump and other Republican organizations — as a key asset.\n\nWith this recent round of regulatory approval, it may come close to meeting its proposed timeline.\n\nThe FDIC approval process kicked off on July 28, which means it received a green light in roughly 5 months. The median application processed last year took over eight months.\n\nSeveral other new bank applications emphasizing digital services are pending with the OCC and other regulators.\n\nMichele Alt, a bank-licensing consultant, said Erebor's quick turnaround at the FDIC is cause for celebration.\n\n\"The prior average was indicative of an unnecessarily slow-moving process and highly risk averse bureaucracy,\" she said in an email to Business Insider. \"I'm delighted to see more efficient processing of bank charter applications.\"",

    "fullText": "Sky TV has emerged as one of the leading television providers in the UK. While any long-term plan adds up over time, the best Sky TV deals and plans can keep your spending to a minimum.\n\nWe've rounded up some of the best Sky TV deals and plans that are active at the time of writing. These plans feature Sky Stream, which means that you can stream your viewing options over WiFi without any extra hardware. Some deals, like Essential TV, offer you Sky's lowest ever price, while other plans are just handy bundles. All options throw in access to ad-supported Netflix and Discovery Plus.\n\nJust keep in mind that most Sky plans and services are available through long-term contracts (usually 24-month commitments), so it's important to read the fine print before signing up. Sky's website notes that prices may change during the 24-month contract. Most deals only apply to new Sky TV customers.\n\nSky TV also offers a \"build your own\" option, with plans starting at £15/month, and other packages that require a satellite dish or other equipment. If you'd prefer to browse plans at your own leisure, you can head directly to Sky TV's deals page.\n\nSky TV is available across a variety of devices, so you're not just confined to watching on your TV at home. The Sky Go app, for on-the-go streaming, is available on phones, tablets, and laptops.\n\nAll the Sky TV plans we've highlighted include one of the two base packs, either Sky Essential or Sky Ultimate. Sky Essential includes Sky Atlantic (plus Netflix and Discovery Plus) and over 100 other channels. Sky Ultimate carries everything found in Sky Essential, in addition to more than 35 premium channels (such as Sky Max and Sky Witness).\n\nSky also has several deals when you bundle broadband and TV. The broadband deals offer anywhere from 150 to 300 Mbps full fibre broadband with Sky Essential or Sky Ultimate TV (plus other add-ons, such as Sky Sports or Sky Cinema). Prices range from £35 to £55 a month.\n\nA broadband connection is a necessity for both the Sky Stream puck and Sky Glass TV. Sky recommends a minimum speed of 25Mbps. This minimum requirement could change depending on your desired package. Watching in UHD or adding an extra Sky Stream puck device will bring that minimum up to at least 30Mbps.\n\nYou can explore a full roundup of current deals on the Sky website.

    "fullText": "TikTok reached a deal with a group of investors to form a new joint venture for its US business, according to an internal memo viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe deal, which TikTok expects to close in January, comes more than a year after Congress passed a law that forced its owner, ByteDance, to divest from its US operations or face a ban, because TikTok was deemed a \"foreign adversary-controlled\" company.\n\nThe new US joint venture will operate independently in areas like US data protection and training its content recommendation algorithm while still connecting to TikTok's global product and business lines like e-commerce and advertising, per the memo from company CEO Shou Chew.\n\nThe announcement is the culmination of a lengthy battle for survival by TikTok, which briefly went dark in the US in January to comply with the divest-or-ban law.\n\nTikTok and ByteDance had sought recourse through the courts, arguing that the law — the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act — violated the First Amendment. In January, the Supreme Court ruled against TikTok and upheld the divest-or-ban law.\n\nSince then, TikTok has been facing a looming deadline to find a US buyer. The app's future remained in limbo for months as the White House repeatedly extended the deadline and administration officials sought to work out a deal.\n\nIn September, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that approved the sale of TikTok's US operation for around $14 billion.\n\nTrump said at the time that Oracle and Larry Ellison would be part of the deal, and Michael Dell and Rupert Murdoch may also be involved. Vice President JD Vance said the buyer group would include \"four or five world-class investors.\"\n\nTikTok did not respond to a request for comment. The White House referred Business Insider to TikTok.",

    "description": "Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot says a 15-year financial guarantee from Google was the key to unlocking billions in project financing from JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.",
    "fullText": "The \"crypto miner\" label is becoming a relic of the past for Hut 8 (HUT).\n\nIn a move that signals a massive strategic shift, Hut 8 announced a $7 billion deal to build a data center complex in Louisiana for Anthropic (ANTH.PVT). The move effectively trades the volatility of bitcoin (BTC-USD) for the high-margin stability of AI infrastructure.\n\n\"We think that the value of energy will continue to go up, and so for us, we [had] to be patient and figure out what was a fair deal that added value to our customers, but that drove a strong return to our shareholders,\" Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid.\n\nThe market is rewarding the transformation. The energy infrastructure company's stock surged roughly 20% on Wednesday following the announcement as investors cheered its potential to secure blue-chip partners in a crowded field.\n\nBeyond the one-day pop, the stock has been a standout in the mining-to-AI pivot, fueled by the company's deep energy assets and its strategic partnership with American Bitcoin (ABTC), a Trump family enterprise in which Hut 8 holds a 60% stake. Year to date, Hut 8 stock is up 90%.\n\nThe linchpin of the Louisiana project is a financial guarantee from Google (GOOG, GOOGL), which guarantees payments of the 15-year lease if Fluidstack, an AI cloud infrastructure provider, cannot meet them. The deal secures 245 megawatts (MW) of capacity, with the possibility to scale up to 2,300 MW within that timeframe — a move that could swell the total lease value to $17.7 billion.\n\n\"We're very excited because it's the first domino to fall,\" Genoot said. \"If we're able to continue to scale and build up to that full strategic partnership on 2,300 MW, we see a lot of growth upside for the company and the deal overall.\"\n\nThe creditworthiness was the key. Genoot noted that without Google's involvement, securing project financing from titans like JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) at favorable rates would have been nearly impossible.\n\nHe added that Google has a \"strong core business,\" including diversified cash flows from Search, YouTube, and cloud services, making the tech giant's pledge the ultimate security for a 15-year infrastructure play.\n\nHowever, securing the money is only half the battle. Competitors have seen their stocks hammered due to construction delays. Genoot claims Hut 8 has de-risked the execution side, partly by issuing a \"conservative delivery schedule\" and tapping local labor.\n\nThe company has turned to established industrial partners, including Jacobs Engineering for design and local contractors like Cajun Electric for electrical services. By scheduling the first data hall delivery for Q2 2027, Genoot said the company is avoiding the \"crunch\" of unrealistic timelines that has plagued the sector.",

    "description": "People were outraged by the president's recent use of this particular expression. Experts in political science and mental health say the term tells quite the story.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump recently leveled one of his commonly used terms in a statement attacking iconic actor and director Rob Reiner shortly after he and his wife, Michele Singer, were found dead at their home on Sunday.\n\nThe president took to his Truth Social platform on Monday to seize on the opportunity to slam Rob Reiner, who was a critic of Trump, and for baselessly attributing the Hollywood filmmaker’s death to “Trump Derangement Syndrome” — a phrase Trump and his supporters often use to attack those who criticize the president, his policies and his rhetoric.\n\nLife: Psychologists React To THAT Post From Trump About Rob Reiner's Death\n\n“Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS,” Trump wrote in part on the social media platform.\n\nTrump’s vile post about Reiner garnered wide condemnation, with many on social media describinghis remarks as“disgusting.” Rocker Jack White took to Instagram to slam the president, writing: “Trump you disgusting, vile, egomaniac, loser, child. Neither he nor any one of his followers can defend this gross, horrible insult to a beautiful artist who gave the world so much.”\n\nThe president also garnered a rare rebuke from many MAGA supporters and a number of the president’s most loyal advocates. He was further criticized when he doubled down on his attacks on Reiner while speaking to reporters at the Oval Office hours later.\n\nThe concept of a so-called “derangement syndrome” has been used against critics of past presidents before. But Trump has a history of frequently using the phrase against his naysayers himself. He had also used the expression against those who opposed him during his first term as president.\n\nLife: How To Do That 'Defying Gravity' Riff Without Murdering Your Voice\n\nAlexandra Cromer, a licensed professional counselor with Thriveworks, believes that Trump’s habit of leveling the phrase “Trump Derangement Syndrome” reveals a lot about his leadership style.\n\n“It reveals that he is not a leader that values, welcomes, or is willing to receive feedback,” she told HuffPost. “This also is a behavior pattern that we see in people with narcissistic tendencies; projection of perceived criticism onto someone else.”\n\nCromer explained that by Trump calling his critics “deranged,” he’s essentially seeking to undermine “the authenticity of the feedback.”\n\n“This reveals that his leadership style is very rigid and very one-dimensional. He is the one to give directions and all others must comply,” she said. “This is a tremendously unhealthy way to receive criticism or any other form of feedback. Psychologically, we know that feedback is critical to not only growth [and] prosperity, but overall health and wellness.”\n\nLife: The Funniest Posts From Women This Week (Dec. 6-12)\n\nShe later continued, “shutting down criticism by engaging in stereotyping and blaming of the source can also be viewed as abusive behavior — that is, behavior that attempts to inflict psychological harm and maintain power structures.”\n\nHallie Kritsas, a licensed mental health counselor and therapist with Thriveworks who specializes in self-esteem, workplace issues and anxiety, told HuffPost that she believes the term “Trump Derangement Syndrome” is “polarizing and emotionally activating.”\n\n“It comes across as a threat and will more than likely increase stress and divide groups in two different ones versus unifying them,” she said.\n\nJacob Neiheisel, associate professor of political science at the University at Buffalo College of Arts and Sciences, told HuffPost that he thinks Trump’s frequent use of the phrase is “meant to be dismissive of his opposition” and intended to “give his followers cover for dismissing similar criticisms that they might hear.”\n\nLife: The Most Popular Dog Names Of 2025\n\n“I think his use of the term reflects his deep-seated disdain for dissent,” he said. “Trump’s leadership style is certainly not one that is welcoming of a ‘team of rivals’ type of approach, but rather one that demands loyalty and a willingness to do political combat on his behalf.”\n\nNeiheisel thinks that the “Trump Derangement Syndrome” phrase has caught on with so many Trump supporters because it “allows them to adopt a similar orientation toward dissent in their own social environments.”\n\n“Simply dismissing the opposition as having a form of mental illness allows them to protect their own attitudes and beliefs, inoculating them against any negativity directed toward Trump,” he added.\n\nNeiheisel thinks that Trump’s attack on Reiner after his death hit “a new low.”\n\nLife: We Asked Actual Historians About Trump's New Plaques — And They Have THOUGHTS\n\n“Republicans had the moral high ground in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s murder and were able to use the negative things said about Kirk after his death to attack Democrats,” he said. “With Trump’s response, that high ground is gone. I think that’s why we saw a number of Republicans condemning Trump’s remarks.”\n\nKritsas believes that Trump’s statements about the iconic director “violated what some might view as a time to grieve and have decency in a moment of loss.”\n\nCromer said that Trump’s harsh words for Reiner was likely particularly upsetting to so many people because the filmmaker was a “universally liked person.”\n\n“While Rob was not a perfect person (because nobody is), he demonstrated consistent prosocial behavior patterns and centered his personal values at the forefront of his personal and professional life,” she said.\n\n“Further, Trump’s remarks state a belief that someone was murdered because they didn’t like Trump; an assertion that can be viewed as narcissistic by inserting himself into a situation that had nothing to do with him in any contextual way,” she continued.\n\nCromer later added that overall, Trump’s remarks about Reiner “communicates a lack of respect for psychological and personal boundaries for those affected by this incident.”\n\nMedical Examiner Report States Rob And Michele Reiner’s Cause Of Death\n\n2 Of Rob Reiner's Children Release Statement On Parents' Deaths\n\nTrump Blames Rob Reiner For His Own Death In Truth Social Post",

    "fullText": "Americans working with a financial advisor average $132,000 in retirement savings, versus $62,000 for those without one.\n\nThose with advisors plan to retire at 64 compared to 66 for non-advised savers.\n\nAdvised savers are more likely to have emergency funds and long-term plans accounting for economic volatility.\n\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nDoubling your retirement savings may sound like a dream scenario, especially since far too many Americans end up with way less money than they need to support themselves in their 401(k)s, IRAs, and other retirement investment accounts.   In reality, though, ending up with twice as much as the average American doesn't have to be as hard as it seems and it doesn't necessarily require you to make a huge income or to sacrifice all fun spending.\n\nInstead, there's one really simple factor that can give you the best chance of doubling your retirement savings. Unfortunately, many Americans don't know what it is and aren't doing it. You don't have to be one of those Americans. Instead, here's what you need to do to build a big nest egg that beats the average.\n\nNorthwestern Mutual's 2024 Planning and Progress study revealed the simple step that Americans have taken to double their retirement savings. According to the research, those who work with a financial advisor have around twice the retirement investment account balances compared to people who try to manage their retirement investing all on their own with no professional advice.\n\nThe research showed that those who have a financial advisor guiding them have around $132,000 in retirement savings, compared with $62,000 among those with no advisor. Those who have an advisor were also planning to retire at a much younger age -- 64, versus 66 for those who have no advisor assisting them. Being able to retire at a younger age is within reach when you have twice the money in your retirement plan, so this is not a surprise.\n\nIt's not just that people working with an advisor were richer, either. Those who had help with managing their money were significantly more likely to have a long-term plan in place that takes economic ups and downs into account. They were also more likely to have emergency savings that can help keep them out of debt and that makes investing for retirement possible, and they were much more likely to feel financially secure.",

    "title": "SLO County won’t cap housing growth across county anymore — except in one town",
    "description": "The San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors’ decision will allow for a maximum of 25 new homes in one unincorporated town next year.",
    "fullText": "Parts of San Luis Obispo County are set to see the number of allowed housing units increase next year — and the infamously building-averse Los Osos is in line to allow more homes.\n\nOn Tuesday, the San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors held a hearing on growth rate allocations for unincorporated parts of the county, which dictate the maximum number of home permits that can be issued each year.\n\nDuring the meeting, county long range planner Dominic Delporto said in 2025, builders only used around 11% of the maximum countywide dwelling unit allocation, or 112 dwelling units requested out of 1,036 allowed.\n\nOn a more local level, the Nipomo Mesa Water Conservation Area saw 27% of its 134-unit maximum allocation utilized, according to the staff report. Conversely, Los Osos’ 25-dwelling unit allocation went unfilled because though several applications were filed, they were still in the use permit process, long-range planning division manager Corey Hahn said.\n\nAfter receiving a review of countywide dwelling unit allocations for 2025, the board turned its attention to the next year and the changes recommended by staff — namely, the elimination of growth rate limits for the Nipomo Mesa and across the county.\n\nLos Osos, which was under a building moratorium from 1988 to October 2024, was the only exception to the removal of growth rate limits.\n\nLos Osos Community Services District board member Chuck Cesena said the CSD, Golden State Water Co. and S&T Mutual Water Co. — the three water purveyors who tap into the Los Osos Groundwater Basin — found the county staff’s justification for an 0.4% growth rate “unpersuasive.”\n\n“The (Basin Management Committee) also noted the uncertainties in the transient model, but recognized correctly that the model uncertainty implies the impacts may be underestimated as well as overestimated,” Cesena said. “Said another way, uncertainty isn’t a green light, it’s a warning sign.”\n\nDelparto said the county’s local coastal program requires a 1% growth cap for Los Osos, but the annual growth rate is to be established based on reviews of groundwater data, the true limiting factor for the community.\n\nBut the sources of groundwater data that the county relies on weren’t all in agreement on how much the community allows to grow.\n\nWhile the Los Osos Basin Management Committee’s “transient model — which simulates groundwater levels and seawater intrusion in the basin using existing data — recommended that the county adopt a 0% growth rate for Los Osos for 2026, county groundwater sustainability director Blaine Reely said the Board should adopt a growth rate of 0.4%, maintaining the previous year’s maximum of 25 new dwelling units.\n\nThat 0.4% growth rate would essentially be a “rerun” of the current year’s allocation, though of course that’s no guarantee that the allocations will be filled, Hahn said.\n\nLos Osos Community Services District general manager Ron Munds said as data on the health of the Los Osos Groundwater Basin is somewhat spotty — and won’t have a five-year average for water levels established until 2028 — proceeding with caution in expanding the number of allocated dwelling units is the best practice.\n\nSeawater intrusion continues to be an issue for the basin, and must be fully accounted for in any talks of expanding housing in Los Osos — something Munds said he didn’t feel was done in the county staff’s recommended amendment.\n\nMunds said while staff such as Reely may have an idea of what the right amount of water pumping should look like, “they do not know the operational challenges we face on a daily basis, which include water quality issues like seawater intrusion, nitrate contamination, emerging contaminants like PFAS, but also the pumping distribution and constraints that we are trying to implement to maximize the quantity of water that we can pump on any given day to the community.”\n\n“The rate of intrusion is what needs to be steady and confirmed to take the cloud of uncertainty, which I feel is a distraction in this conversation today, out of the discussion,” Munds said. “On that note, one of the county consultants stated that there’s ample time to react to the uncertainty, which I believe is an irresponsible comment and approach when it comes to protecting our community’s only water supply.”\n\nDespite the Los Osos CSD’s warnings of overtapping the basin, the Board voted 4-1 to approve the staff’s amendment, with Supervisor Jimmy Paulding the sole “no” vote, removing growth caps for the unincorporated parts of the county save for Los Osos’ 0.4% cap.\n\nSupervisor Bruce Gibson argued that Los Osos’ cap was a “conservative response” to the concerns voiced by the Los Osos CSD.\n\nAccording to the county staff’s presentation, the 0.4% growth rate for next year had already been reduced from 0.6% to 0.4% to try to address these concerns, though a 0.8% growth rate is prescribed for 2027.\n\nStarting in 2028 and beyond, growth rates can be established based on a five-year rolling average that is currently in the data collection stage, according to the staff report.\n\n“We could certainly justify 0.6% as per the growth management ordinance that’s set out, but keeping the growth rate at 0.4% so we can continue the efforts to exercise the transient model for some different scenarios is more than protective of the groundwater,” Gibson said.\n\nGibson said he supported eliminating the growth cap in the rest of unincorporated San Luis Obispo County because the number of permit requests haven’t approached the cap in recent years.\n\nPaulding said he voted against the growth rate changes because he couldn’t support the elimination of growth caps for the Nipomo Mesa Water Conservation Area.\n\n“It’s no secret that the bulk of the housing that we’re seeing in the unincorporated areas in San Luis Obispo County is occurring in the community of Nipomo,” Paulding said. “This growth management ordinance only looks at when a building permit is processed — it’s not looking at what the number of units in the overall pipeline are based on land use approvals, so it doesn’t give us a good tool to actually measure what’s coming and whether or not we have the infrastructure, resources and services to support that growth.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Speaker Mike Johnson had a ready-made refrain when asked why Republicans weren't moving to extend federal health care subsidies: their party wanted to help 100% of Americans with their costs, not just the 7% of Americans enrolled in Affordable Care Act plans.\n\nBut not 100% of his conference agreed.\n\nA rare revolt from the moderate wing of the party has upended Johnson's plans. Four Republicans this week signed onto a Democratic discharge petition that guarantees that the House will vote on extending the ACA subsidies sometime in January, with Republican leaders now powerless to stop it.\n\nFor Democrats, it was vindication of a months-long strategy, starting with the government shutdown in the fall, that pushed the expiration of the ACA support to the forefront of politics. Republicans from competitive districts most at risk of losing their seats in next year's midterms felt the political pressure as they heard from constituents about their skyrocketing premiums.\n\n“Nothing has changed with House Republican leadership, but something has changed within their own ranks,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar, chair of the House Democratic Caucus.\n\nFlanked by his caucus Thursday on the Capitol steps, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries demanded that Johnson allow a vote on the three-year extension of ACA subsidies before lawmakers leave for the holidays: “Not tomorrow. Not next week. Not next year. Today.”\n\nJohnson refused, saying it will “be on the floor that first week of January when we return.”\n\nLawmakers prepare to leave in limbo\n\nThe impasse left lawmakers with a cliffhanger as they headed home for the holiday break. Republican leaders now face growing pressure to appease centrist members who are threatening to side with Democrats to approve an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies for three years.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune has to confront the issue as well. Any ACA bill clearing the House would simply push the fight to the Senate, which has already rejected a three-year extension.\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has been meeting and discussing possible compromise bills that would extend the subsidies but put new limitations on them. But they would not consider anything until January.\n\nThune told reporters Thursday that a three-year extension of “a failed program that’s rife with fraud, waste and abuse is not happening.”\n\nYet Republican leaders in both chambers have not offered a plan that fully addresses members’ concerns about the sharp insurance cost increases many Americans are expected to face in 2026 and potentially beyond.\n\nThe White House has been engaged in discussions about the healthcare proposals but has largely allowed House Republicans to sort out their internal divisions and coalesce around a plan on their own, according to a senior administration official involved in the talks who was granted anonymity to discuss private discussions.\n\nHouse Republicans on Wednesday passed a 100-plus-page health care package centered on long-standing GOP priorities, including expanding coverage options for small businesses and the self-employed. The bill would also rein in pharmacy benefit managers — middlemen that manage drug costs and process insurance claims.\n\nJohnson touted the measure as “a bigger and better and more important thing for 100% of Americans, not just 7% of Americans.” But some Republicans who face tough reelection bids remain fixated on the looming spike in ACA costs.\n\nThe holidays provide Johnson with a brief window to try to persuade moderates to abandon the effort. The discharge petition froze once it reached the 218-signature threshold, meaning that while only four Republicans have publicly signed on, more may be willing to support the Democratic bill.\n\nRep. Ryan Mackenzie, one of the four Republicans who signed the Democratic petition, said it has “generated more conversations” and that “hopefully over the next three weeks, we will actually see some changes in some bipartisan efforts that actually can generate a meaningful vote that gets 218 in the House and 60 in the Senate.”\n\n“I think allowing a vote is critically important,” Mackenzie said. “I think everybody should be able to put up their votes on the board, and they should be able to let everybody in the American public see how they voted on these individual issues.”\n\nLeader Jeffries' waiting game pays off\n\nFor months, Jeffries refused to support a one-year extension of ACA subsidies that a bipartisan group of lawmakers had been pursuing, dismissing it as a “non-starter” and “a laughable proposition.”\n\nInstead, he held firm on a three-year extension with no income caps or cost offsets. That strategy paid off, as GOP moderates were forced to move in his direction when Johnson refused to allow any vote on an ACA extension.\n\nJeffries has faced criticism this year from progressive members of his caucus and grassroots groups who have urged him to push back more forcefully against Trump and Republicans. But on Thursday, much of the party rallied behind him on the Capitol steps, with several lawmakers praising his approach.\n\n“As Leader Jeffries has said all along, this is the only real plan on the table,” said Aguilar.\n\nStill, while Democrats have secured a vote, insurance costs for millions are set to rise next year, and passage of a three-year ACA subsidies extension remains a long shot even if it does pass the House. Senate Republicans have already rejected the three-year extension, but some GOP senators who are open to a deal on the subsidies said a House vote could provide momentum.\n\n“We could have a vehicle — if we could get Republicans and Democrats behind it — then we could send it back,” said GOP Sen. Thom Tillis, adding that it “means that there’s still a chance.”\n\nFor Democrats, the fight has also allowed them to unify around a message they believe could prove potent on the campaign trail.\n\n“The Republican health care crisis is unacceptable, unconscionable, and un-American,” Jeffries said.\n\nThe decision by four Republicans to break with party leadership and join Democrats is only the latest sign of discontent in the narrowly divided House.\n\nJohnson has argued that the criticism directed at his leadership — and lawmakers repeatedly bypassing leadership to force votes — is inevitable given the slim GOP majority. He said he lacks the advantages of a large majority, where “the speaker had a long stick that he would administer punishment.”\n\n“I don’t have that, because we have a small margin,” he said. Of the ACA extensions, Johnson said leadership had “talked about it at length” with GOP moderates, describing the conversations as “some intense fellowship.”\n\n“Everybody’s in good spirits now and everybody understands what’s happening,” he added.\n\nSome GOP members, however, don’t appear to share that assessment. There was lingering discontent as lawmakers headed home for the holidays.\n\n“I don't know how we did not vote on a good bipartisan extension,” said GOP Rep. Don Bacon, adding that Democrats will use the health care issue “like a sledgehammer” on the campaign trail.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., insisted that Republicans are finishing the year “as united as we've ever been.”\n\n“We set out on a course to do big things, not little things, and that means we’re going to have some differences along the way.”",

    "fullText": "Concerns are growing about how polluted water from roadways is affecting not just the environment but human populations as well.\n\nIn a study published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology Letters, researchers out of the Guangdong Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution and Health took a closer look at tiny particles shed from car tires and the toxic chemicals that they can release over time.\n\nOver the course of the study, 150 urine samples were collected from three different populations across South China. The participants included adults, children, and pregnant women.\n\nThe team discovered that the chemical 6PPD and its toxic byproduct, 6PPD-quinone, were common pollutants in the urine of those tested. In fact, the chemicals were detected in 60-100% of samples.\n\nWhile the researchers acknowledged that both 6PPD and 6PPD-quinone were prevalent in the environment, they noted that there was a lack of studies to determine if these harmful chemicals were making their way inside humans. Since the chemicals are known to be highly toxic to aquatic animals, there are concerns that humans could face similar dangers.\n\nAccording to NOAA Fisheries, scientists developed a test to detect 6PPD-quinone in fish, shellfish, and other marine mammals. They hope that the tool will allow them to track the chemical's movement and buildup in food webs. This could lead to a better understanding of its risks to ecosystems and better stormwater management systems.\n\nIn a study published in Environmental Research, scientists pointed to tire particles as the leading contributor to microplastic pollution. These tiny particles derived from fossil fuels have been linked to a number of severe health issues, including an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurological disorders.\n\nHenry Obanya, a researcher from the University of Portsmouth and lead author of the study, detailed the team's findings in an essay for The Conversation, pushing for the reclassification of harmful chemicals such as 6PPD and 6PPD-quinone.\n\n\"We urgently need to classify tire particles as a unique pollution category,\" Obanya wrote. He noted that because of the array of chemicals used to create tires, we may not know the true impact of the contamination in our bodies until more research is conducted.\n\n\"Tire particles tend to be made from a complex mix of synthetic and natural rubbers, along with hundreds of chemical additives,\" Obanya added. \"This means the consequences of tire pollution can be unexpected and far reaching.\"\n\nHow concerned are you about microplastics in your body?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "TREMONTON, Utah (ABC4) — A sacred rock with petroglyphs important to the Northwestern Band (NWB) of the Shoshone Nation has been restored and returned to its original location after it spent decades at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints meetinghouse.\n\nThe petroglyphs are around 1,200 years old, and they were created by the Fremont people, who were ancestors of the NWB of the Shoshone Nation. The effort to restore the petroglyphs and return them took over a decade, and it involved the NWB of the Shoshone Nation, the state of Utah, and conservators working with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nGrand Canyon trail closures announced for 2026 construction\n\nAccording to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the rock was removed from its original location in the northern Utah mountains about 80 years ago, and it spent the majority of that time outside of the Tremonton meetinghouse.\n\nRyan Saltzgiver, history sites curator for the Church History Department, said that it’s unknown exactly why the 2,500-pound rock was brought to the church, but in 2011, it was discovered by amateur archeologists.\n\nSaltzgiver said that they’ve spent the time since that discovery working with the NWB of the Shoshone Nation and the Utah State Historic Preservation Office to bring everyone together and create a plan for preservation and repatriation.\n\nBYU students’ book supporting mental health nonprofits\n\nBrad Parry, vice chair of the NWB of the Shoshone Nation, said, “Putting it back for us is putting a puzzle piece back into place. Our history is so fractured with a lot of things that happened to us. To have these positive things now that are coming out — it’s rebuilding our history. And I can’t overstate that.”\n\n“We do have a moral and ethical obligation to care for things like this that are in our possession — and in particular to return those things that are, in this case, very sacred objects to those rightful owners,” Saltzgiver said.\n\nThe restoration process was very involved, as conservators chosen by Church historians cleaned years of lichen growth from the rock. They had to clean it without damaging the surface or the petroglyphs, and conservators wound up using soap and water, nontoxic biocide, and steam.\n\nHow to make ABC4 your preferred news source on Google\n\nMegan Randall, an objects conservator with the Midwest Art Conservation Center, said, “Even if it’s not the cleanest, in a couple months or a year, it will continue to sort of clean itself with the application of the biocide. There’s not that many people out there who do this, which makes our work very interesting and varied.”\n\nRandall also highlighted the spiritual importance of the petroglyphs to the tribe. “We want to make those visible and appreciable by the people who find value in this, which is also us,” she said.\n\nThe rock was returned to its original location near the Utah-Idaho border, joining its companion petroglyphs. A ceremony was held, including a blessing from a Shoshone tribal spiritual leader.\n\n“This rock was meant to be here. It’s like this rock knows it’s home,” Parry said.\n\nTimeline: Court proceedings for Tyler Robinson, man accused of killing Charlie Kirk\n\nUTA to upgrade bus fleet using $41 million in federal funding\n\nCapitol Conversations: Rep.

    "title": "ChatGPT Works With Apple Music Now, for Some Reason",
    "description": "You can't even play full songs in ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "When ChatGPT first launched, it was strictly about dealing with text. You could ask it to write you a poem, to check your code for errors, or to build you a grocery list from a recipe. Fast forward three years, and the app has changed completely—for better or for worse. Not only has ChatGPT's large language model (LLM) improved dramatically from GPT-3.5 to GPT-5.2, but the bot has gone multimodal. It can understand text, but also images, video, and the internet at large. 2025's ChatGPT is hardly the same product as 2022's.\n\nOne of the many upgrades to ChatGPT over the past three years has been app integrations: You've been able to connect OpenAI's chatbot to ask it to do things on your behalf. You could connect to Expedia to ask ChatGPT for help booking a hotel, Zillow to ask the bot to help you find an apartment, or Canva for help with creating a slide. Whether these integrations are any more useful than simply using the respective app itself is perhaps up to each user, but these integrations exist all the same.\n\nFidji Simo, OpenAI's CEO of applications, announced the integration in a Substack post on Tuesday. Among other updates, like a new image gen model and new writing tools, Simo revealed new app integrations for the chatbot, including OpenTable, Salesforce, Clay, Lovable, and, of course, Apple Music. At the time, details were limited, but now, the integration is officially live.\n\nFirst of all, you don't actually need to It's an interesting note, since Apple Music itself requires a paid subscription to access. But with ChatGPT, you can access elements of the services without paying—keyword \"elements.\"\n\nOnce you connect the services together, you'll be able to search Apple Music for songs, artists, albums, and playlists within ChatGPT. In addition to music discoverability, you can also generate playlists, and listen to clips of songs you find. ChatGPT doesn't specify how long those clips are, but if they base it off of iTunes, it could be anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. If you thought this integration was all about listening to Apple Music tunes while using ChatGPT, think again: You'll still need Apple Music itself for the listening side of things.\n\nOf course, if you have an Apple Music account, the integration is a bit more useful. If so, you'll be able to add songs, albums, and playlists to your Apple Music library that you found or generated from ChatGPT.\n\nLove it or hate it, ChatGPT isn't necessarily designed with user privacy in mind. After all, part of the company's business model is training its LLMs on your ChatGPT interactions—unless you specifically opt out. As such, the idea of connecting your Apple Music subscription to ChatGPT raises some privacy alarm bells in my mind. Apple Music doesn't have the most sensitive user information in your digital portfolio, but it does contain quite a bit of extra data ChatGPT can collect from you.\n\nAt the top of the Apple music connection tool, OpenAI says, \"You're in control.\" The company is adamant that ChatGPT \"always respects\" your preferences on training data, and is held to the permissions you've already set. That said, the company also warns that by using apps, you run the risk of falling victim to attack: If hackers decide to attack ChatGPT, your data could get swooped up. You'll also end up sharing data points like your IP address and approximate location, as well as ChatGPT data with Apple Music. (The data sharing goes both ways here.)\n\nOne benefit here is that ChatGPT doesn't appear to have access to your listening history. While the app can create playlists for you, it can't actually see what you're choosing to listen to in Apple Music itself.\n\nI personally don't use ChatGPT, and even if I did, I don't think I'd connect my Apple Music account here. I find the discoverability within the app itself fine for my needs, and when it isn't, the greater internet already helps me find new music. I'm not sure I'd feel the benefits of ChatGPT's intelligence here, especially when it comes with the risk of keeping all my Apple Music data in yet another location.\n\nIf you're not like me, and you're interested in trying out this integration, you can connect Apple Music to ChatGPT from the latter's app or web app. Head to the sidebar, choose Apps, then find and select \"Apple Music.\"",

    "description": "You can connect apps like Photoshop, Apple Music, and Slack to ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "Earlier this year, OpenAI announced ChatGPT apps. Not the ChatGPT app, mind you: That's been out for more than a couple years now. ChatGPT apps, on the other hand, are programs that work within ChatGPT. You can access them in any given conversation with ChatGPT—in fact, they may appear based on the context of the conversation.\n\nThese aren't necessarily apps that OpenAI builds itself, either; rather, you'll find options here based on apps you may use yourself. The initial batch of apps included with the feature's rollout included Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Figma, Expedia, Spotify, and Zillow—big apps you've likely used before.\n\nWhile in a conversation with ChatGPT, you could ask the bot to help you book a flight to Paris via Expedia, find a particular listing through Zillow, or create a slide for a presentation with Canva. From OpenAI's perspective, this adds a host of additional functionality to ChatGPT the company couldn't offer itself. OpenAI doesn't need to build an apartment-hunting tool into ChatGPT; it can just pull in Zillow. It also doesn't escape me that the more apps that OpenAI folds into ChatGPT, the less likely it is you'll need to leave ChatGPT to do something in another app—but that's none of my business.\n\nSpeaking of more apps, the company plans to expand these apps overtime, as developers create ChatGPT-compatible extensions for their programs. That was part of yesterday's news: OpenAI is now letting developers submit apps to ChatGPT en masse. What's more, these apps will be hosted in an \"app directory,\" though many online are taking to calling it an app store. (There's no payment necessary, however, so app directory might really be a more apt description.) You'll find this new app directory in the sidebar of ChatGPT, appropriately called \"Apps.\"\n\nApps is apparently in beta, according to a label affixed to its title in ChatGPT. Here, you'll find a rotating slide featuring an ad for some of the service's biggest apps, like Canva and Zillow, and, below it, rows of apps to choose from. Right now, the apps are sorted into \"Featured,\" \"Lifestyle,\" and \"Productivity,\" with no option that includes all the apps. (But they seem to be entirely split across Lifestyle and Productivity.) There are a lot of options here already. Some made headlines this week, like Photoshop and Apple Music, while others arrived more quietly, like Asana, Uber, and Target. It's not just traditional apps like Zillow or Spotify that are getting the app treatment here, either. OpenAI is also considering \"connector\" services, like Google Drive, as \"apps.\"\n\nYou can click on any app in the directory to see what you can do with it. Slack, for example, says you can look up your chats and messages to summarize threads, generate recaps, and come up with responses. You can check on your Asana tasks to generate progress reports and status updates. Outlook says you can create \"talking points\" and generate follow-ups from your emails and calendar events. While there's a brief summary underneath each title, you'll need to click through to each service to see the full picture of what it actually offers.\n\nHere are the apps I'm seeing at this time. Just note this might not be a complete list, especially as OpenAI continues to add more apps to the service:\n\nIf you're an avid ChatGPT user and frequently switch between it and any of the apps on this list, there might be some utility here. Maybe coders will find the integration with Hugging Face and Lovable to be beneficial, while Photoshop users might take advantage of the AI image editing tools this integration provides. But I'm still left feeling like this is more gimmick than anything else: I don't need to connect my Slack to ChatGPT to generate follow-ups for me: I'm perfectly capable of responding to emails myself, and managing my own calendar, so no need to connect Outlook or another email client to the bot. Maybe a future update will sell me on connecting generative AI to all aspects of my work and personal life, but so far, I'm still not convinced.",

    "fullText": "After an intense debate on player availability and the timing of the tournament, the focus has begun to shift to the pitch as another mid-season edition of the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) kicks off in Morocco on Sunday.\n\nOn the face of it, the two main talking points ahead of the 2025 finals are whether the host nation can extend their world record run of 18 consecutive wins and claim just a second title, and if Mohamed Salah will finally lift the trophy with Egypt.\n\nThe 33-year-old's future at Liverpool has dominated headlines since his explosive assertion on 6 December that he has been \"thrown under the bus\" by the club.\n\nAfter making his return from the bench at Anfield last Saturday, Salah will now be focused on his fifth attempt to clinch the continent's biggest prize - especially after two previous defeats in finals.\n\nBut concentrating on just two topics would not do justice to a unique tournament characterised by unpredictability.\n\nIvory Coast delivered a remarkable home success in February last year, having sacked their coach during the group stage, while Senegal's fine form was underlined by their win over England in June.\n\nElsewhere, Nigeria aim to go one better than at the 2023 finals but fellow heavyweights Cameroon appear, from the outside, to be in chaos - with both countries looking to make amends after missing out on the 2026 Fifa World Cup.\n\nWith seven different winners from the past eight editions, Morocco 2025 is certain to be a compelling watch as sides battle for a trophy hailed as the \"holy grail of African football\" by Benin assistant coach Tunde Adelakun.\n\n\"It's so hard to win the Africa Cup of Nations. People love us a lot, but if [you] win they will never forget you,\" Morocco midfielder Sofyan Amrabat told the BBC World Service.",
