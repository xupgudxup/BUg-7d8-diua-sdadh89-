Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt's not often that a 23-year old who has produced at the MLB level is a free agent.\n\nBut the Colorado Rockies chose after the season not to keep Warming Bernabel under a contract going forward. On Friday, the Washington Nationals took advantage.\n\nSpencer Nusbaum of The Washington Post has reported that Bernabel has signed a minor-league contract with the Nats that includes an invite to MLB spring training.\n\nBernabel made his MLB debut for the Rockies in July.\n\nIn Bernabel's first 28 at bats, he had 14 hits. That included three home runs.\n\nMORE: The Mets keep taking players from the Yankees\n\nThere's a reason the Rockies didn't keep him, though.\n\nThe reason stems from what happened after that 14-for-28 start.\n\nFrom that point on, Bernabel hit just .189 the rest of the season.\n\nHe had a concussion in September, too, which hampered the end to the season. And he wasn't a great defender.\n\nBernabel did hit .301 in Triple-A in 2025, so the bat can clearly play.\n\nHis production did take a leap forward in 2025 over previous seasons, to the Nationals are betting on him continuing to improve.\n\nIt's certainly a low-risk add for the Nats.\n\nDodgers' payroll is even more loaded with Edwin Diaz\n\nIt's a good day to remember Bob Feller's brilliance and his time in the U.S. Navy\n\nHow Aroldis Chapman is able to pitch for Great Britain in the WBC\n\nNationals sign pitcher after 3 seasons in Japan\n\nAlex Bregman has a key free agent preference\n\nYankees' pitcher leaving MLB to sign in Japan",

    "description": "At age 12, His Airness signed a program for a 1975 state baseball tournament",
    "fullText": "Long before Michael Jordan was a six-time NBA champion with the Chicago Bulls, the future GOAT stood in the driveway of 505 North Watterson Street in Kings Mountain, North Carolina, with a basketball in his hand.\n\nIt was the winter of 1985, and the 22-year-old Jordan was in an intense free-throw contest with young Justin Jones, 10.\n\nAfter Jones hit eight of 10 at the stripe, it was MJ’s turn to show off his clutch gene. In typical Jordan style, he made 10 straight with his right hand, 10 straight with his left hand and 10 straight with his eyes closed.\n\nJordan was shooting hoops with a kid, instead of dazzling on an NBA court during his second season, because he had fractured a bone in his left foot and was back in the state where he grew up.\n\nWhy specifically here, in Kings Mountain?\n\nWell, a decade earlier, Jordan came to town with his youth team from Wilmington, N.C., to participate in the 1975 Dixie Youth Baseball State Tournament.\n\nBecause Jordan’s team had traveled 238 miles to the tournament and, like some other teams, could not return home in between games, Frank and Nina Mitchem volunteered to host Jordan and another player, Reggie Murrill. Jones is the grandson of the Mitchems.\n\nJordan, then 12, nearly threw a no-hitter and hit a three-run home run during the tournament for his team, the Cape Fear Optimist, and won “Mr. Baseball” for his age division. A completed bracket inside the tournament program suggests Jordan’s team went on to win it all.\n\nBefore Jordan and Mitchem left the house after the tournament, Nina, according to family lore, asked the boys to sign the program “for when they become famous.” Mitchem also had Jordan and Murrill write their home phone numbers so she and her husband could keep in touch.\n\nThe tournament was only six days, but Jordan and the Mitchems did keep in touch. The relationship was so special that even as MJ rose in prominence, he returned to Kings Mountain every summer until about 1988.\n\nWhen Nina Mitchem died in 1999, the family found letters exchanged between her and Jordan. But it wasn’t until 2012, in cleaning a closet in the house when the family found the signed Dixie program.\n\nIn the recent months, Jones, now the owner of his grandparents' program, was looking to add more insurance to his collection. After speaking with David Hunt of Hunt Auctions, he decided to auction it off.\n\nThere’s no way to be sure, but it is believed this is the earliest Michael Jordan autograph to ever surface.\n\nJordan signed the program “Michael Jordan,” which would not have been typical at the time. Jordan was almost exclusively known as \"Mike\" until he hit the famous national-title winning shot at North Carolina seven years later.\n\nIn the team photo caption in the Dixie program, Jordan is referred to as “Mike.”\n\nIn fact, a baseball Jordan signed in 1976, a year later, for his Babe Ruth baseball team, was signed “Mike Jordan.” That ball sold for $36,000 a Goldin in 2020.\n\nJones told cllct he has more memories of Jordan, who he considered an uncle, than he has memorabilia, especially that day shooting hoops at his grandparents' home.\n\n“I once asked him for his autograph and he said, ‘Why would you want that? I know you,” Jordan said. “I didn’t ask after that.”\n\nThe program, which has an estimate of $20,000 to $40,000, has a top bid of $5,000. It closes Jan. 12.\n\nWant more stories like this? \n\nDarren Rovell is the founder of cllct and one of the country's leading reporters on the collectibles market.

    "fullText": "Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Archie Gray was in the spotlight this week following a poor performance in the demoralising 3-0 defeat to Nottingham Forest on Sunday.\n\nThe Spurs ace gave Guglielmo Vicario a bad pass that was seized upon, and the North London side were made to pay the price.\n\nMany Tottenham fans have been clamouring to see Gray start games, but his performance left a lot to be desired.\n\nBesides the error leading to the goal, he did not win any duel and was a passenger as Tottenham were comprehensively crushed.\n\nHeading into the new game week, Spurs manager Thomas Frank was asked how the 19-year-old is dealing with the criticism.\n\nFrank said (via THFC’s website), “He’s been good. Also, when I watched the game back, I think actually he was the one that wanted the ball instant after the mistake.\n\n“So I like that mentality, wanting to get on the ball. It’s part of it. Everyone who played football at this level or any level made a mistake.\n\n“You make a mistake in life, you need to go back on it and go again.\n\n“The beautiful thing about football, especially at this level, and in Tottenham, if you make a mistake, you can be pretty sure there will be a few questions about it.\n\n“But you, of course, need to be able to manage it, and he will do that.”\n\nThere is no doubting Gray’s talent or mentality, and Frank is right to highlight the teenager’s willingness to demand the ball again after a costly mistake.\n\nThat courage will serve him well in the long run.\n\nBut development is not always linear, and throwing a 19-year-old straight back into the furnace against Liverpool may do more harm than good.\n\nFor this clash, pragmatism should prevail. A midfield pivot of Rodrigo Bentancur and Joao Palhinha offers far more control and protection.\n\nDropping Gray would not be a punishment, but sensible management.\n\nA brief spell on the bench could ease the spotlight, protect his confidence, and allow him to learn from the sidelines.\n\nThere will be plenty of time to build him up again, but against Liverpool, Spurs need experience, steel, and stability in the engine room.",

    "fullText": "Stephenville (TX) vs. Kilgore (TX): Live updates, score of Texas UIL 4A Division I title contest originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nARLINGTON, TEXAS - Two teams that have won state titles this century face off Friday morning for the chance to claim more hardware.\n\nStephenville and Kilgore square off at AT&T Stadium in the Texas University Interscholastic League 4A Division I championship game.\n\nLIVE STREAM:Victory+ (Victory Plus) will stream for free all 12 UIL state championship games.\n\nIn Stephenville’s case, the Yellow Jackets are trying to continue a trend. They have made the state title game for the seventh time in program history, and in the previous six, they have won it all, winning in 1993, 1994, 1998, 1999, 2012 and 2021.\n\nStephenville enters Friday’s latest title tilt at 15-0 overall. Among the Jackets’ wins was a 28-12 regular-season decision against Ruston (La.), which played in last week’s Louisiana Non-Select Division I title game.\n\nLast week, Stephenville got a field goal in the final seconds to upend defending state champion Celina, 24-21.\n\nThis is Kilgore’s second straight trip to the title game, having lost to Celina last season. Kilgore’s first championship game appearance was in 2004, and the Bulldogs claimed the title that season, and they also returned in 2013.\n\nKilgore dropped its season opener to Carthage - which is playing for the 4A Division II championship later on Friday - but have reeled off 14 straight wins, the latest a 49-0 win against La Vernia in last week’s semifinal round.\n\nFollow The Sporting News correspondent Buck Ringgold (@Bucks_Ballpark) for all of the live updates and scoring from Arlington.\n\nScroll down for live score and game updates from kickoff to the postgame. Refresh this page for the latest.\n\n- Kilgore will force Stephenville to punt as we have reached the two-minute warning.\n\n- INTERCEPTION STEPHENVILLE. Whatchoo talkin' bout, Willis? Willis Jackson makes a diving grab in the end zone for Stephenville's third takeaway on the day, stopping Kilgore's potential drive. Still scoreless with 2:37 left in the half.\n\n- Stephenville is called for a personal foul penalty, and Kilgore now has a first-and-goal at the Jackets' 7-yard line with less than five minutes to go in the half.\n\n- On a third down play, Kilgore QB Kayson Brooks finds receiver Tyler Johnigan along the sideline and Johnigan is able to move forward for a first down near the Stephenville 20.\n\n- FUMBLE RECOVERY KILGORE. Ball falls out on a running play, and Kilgore's Bi'syn Williams is there to scoop it up and he has a long return to just past midfield in Stephenville territory with 7:02 left in the half. First takeaway for the Ragin' Red defense.\n\n- Stephenville converts a fourth down as Trot Jordan finds Adan Jergins for a gain inside the Kilgore 30. We are under nine minutes to go in the half.\n\n- Stephenville had 46 yards of total offense in the first quarter, while Kilgore had 45. But the Jackets have already forced two turnovers.\n\nUIL 4A Div. I Championship\n\nEnd 1: Kilgore 0, Stephenville 0. pic.twitter.com/Ca0gdizc7Y\n\n— KTBS Sports (@KTBS_Sports) December 19, 2025\n\n- Kilgore throws an incomplete pass on third down and will punt it away. The ball bounces all the way to the Stephenville 28-yard line as the opening quarter comes to an end.\n\n- Stephenville reaches the Kilgore 25 before the drive stalls. Jackets try a 41-yard field goal, but the kick is short. Bulldogs take over with 1:38 left in the quarter.\n\n- Stephenville converts on a fourth down just past midfield on a short run from Zyler McClendon with more than five minutes to go in the half.\n\n- FUMBLE RECOVERY STEPHENVILLE. Stephenville gets its second takeaway, as the Jackets forced a fumble and recovered it. After a lengthy replay review, the ruling is upheld. Hudson Butchee, who earlier had the interception, forced the fumble, and teammate Cooper Fergeson landed on it near the Stephenville 45.\n\n- Another third-down chance for Stephenville but a pass is overthrown. Jackets go for it on fourth down, but Kilgore linebacker Isaiah Watters brings down quarterback Trot Jordan for a loss. Bulldogs take over at their 41 with 7:25 left in the opening period.\n\n- Stephenville tailback Zyler McClendon picks up a first down on a third-down play. Jackets have the ball near Kilgore's 35.\n\n- INTERCEPTION STEPHENVILLE. Kilgore makes a first down on its opening drive, but on a third-down play, a pass gets picked off by the Jackets' Hudson Butchee right at midfield. Stephenville on offense for the first time today.\n\n.@ButcheeHudson with an early takeaway for Stephenville!\n\nThe senior LB picks off Kayson Brooks on the game's first drive at #UILState.https://t.co/wKSaNdPjA2@SvilleYJFB | #TXHSFBpic.twitter.com/FmslEbwm6d\n\n— Dave Campbell's — TexasFootball.com (@dctf) December 19, 2025\n\n- Toe meets leather and we are under way at AT&T. Kilgore fields the kickoff near its own 20 and brings it out to the 30. But an illegal block penalty moves the ball back to the 20.\n\n- Kilgore has won the toss and has elected to receive. So Stephenville will kick off to start this contest.\n\n- Stephenville is the visiting team and they are wearing navy blue helmets, white jerseys and white pants.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhenever star players become available in the NBA, or even when they’re simply involved in rumors, the Los Angeles Lakers are typically linked to them.\n\nWhether it’s to drive up the price or because the Lakers have a genuine interest, we see it happen all the time.\n\nIt’s a bit crazy how often the Lakers are connected to these names, but nobody would have expected the team to trade for Luka Doncic a year ago.\n\nPerhaps Lakers fans have a point when they believe the franchise will eventually land another star.\n\nThe latest name to surface is Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks. While the Bucks may not be looking to move on from Antetokounmpo, Michael Scotto of HoopsHype reported that teams like the Lakers continue to monitor the situation, even if nothing is pressing at the moment.\n\n“In fact, rival executives interested in trading for Antetokounmpo who’ve spoken with HoopsHype said they don’t believe Milwaukee wants to move him right now. With that said, it’s unlikely to keep teams such as the New York Knicks, Miami Heat, Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Lakers, San Antonio Spurs, Atlanta Hawks, Minnesota Timberwolves, Houston Rockets, and others from continuing to monitor Antetokounmpo’s situation to varying degrees, looking ahead,” he wrote.\n\nLanding Antetokounmpo would give the Lakers one of the best duos in the NBA for a long time, assuming he and Doncic can stay on the court when it matters most.\n\nAntetokounmpo has dealt with his fair share of injuries, but he would still be worth whatever the Lakers would have to give up.\n\nLakers' LeBron James turns back the clock with vicious dunk\n\nLakers face Luka Doncic-LeBron James crossroads after JJ Redick's latest on-court experiment\n\nLuka Doncic makes basketball history never done by Lakers point guard\n\nLakers' Luka Doncic broke all-time Anthony Davis record",

    "fullText": "For most, filmmaking isn't a lucrative profession. But for a select few, it can really pay off.\n\nIn an industry where few want to be a part of failures and seemingly everyone wants a piece of the successes, these five directors have risen above the fray to not just be master storytellers, but get paid like them.\n\nJames Cameron, who has made the highest-grossing movies of all time on numerous occasions, is the latest to join the three-comma club.\n\nHere are all the directors who are worth more than $1 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nThanks to \"Titanic\" and the \"Avatar\" franchise, both of which spent some time as the highest-grossing movies of all time, Cameron has crafted a lucrative empire.\n\nThanks to the stage, film, and TV productions surrounding his character Madea, and the 330-acre movie studio he created in Atlanta, Tyler Perry is the richest Black filmmaker of all time.\n\nPeter Jackson went from making low-budget horror movies to helming one of the most successful franchises of all time with \"The Lord of the Rings.\" It was a massive commercial and critical success, with Jackson collecting Oscars for best picture, best director, and best adapted screenplay.\n\nOne of the architects of the modern Hollywood blockbuster, George Lucas' \"Star Wars\" franchise didn't just change the movie business forever, it also change how creatives can monetize their work. By demanding to own the merchandising and sequel rights to \"Star Wars,\" which movie studios saw as losses back in the late 1970s, Lucas pulled the ultimate fast one on the establishment.\n\nOut of the \"Hollywood brats\" who redefined the movie business in the 1970s, Steven Spielberg remains the last to consistently produce massive event movies to this day. His credits — \"Jaws,\" \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\" \"E.T.,\" the \"Indiana Jones\" franchise, the \"Jurassic Park\" franchise — didn't just make him a billionaire; they unlocked the imaginations of generations of people.",

    "description": "London Business School professor Ekaterina Abramova said that rapid AI disruption could outpace institutions and destabilize societies.",
    "fullText": "A historic labor shock may be about to hit the job market.\n\nThat's according to London Business School professor Ekaterina Abramova.\n\nShe said AI is advancing so quickly that it could trigger mass layoffs long before new jobs emerge to replace them — a mismatch that has historically fueled social unrest.\n\nAbramova, who studies technology-driven economic transitions, said the past three years of AI advances mark a sharp break from earlier waves of mechanization.\n\nIn past eras — from 18th-century textile automation to late-20th-century manufacturing decline — the impact was mostly gradual and largely contained to individual sectors, she said.\n\nBut AI is different: \"A single AI model can displace thousands of cognitive jobs across multiple industries overnight,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nAbramova expects layoffs to outstrip new job creation over the next five to 10 years, especially without aggressive retraining efforts.\n\nWhile the exact number of AI-related layoffs is unknown, several major companies have already cited AI as a reason to reduce head count or to announce job cuts.\n\nNew AI-related roles often require skills or credentials that many displaced workers lack, Abramova said, and entry-level positions — such as junior developers, analysts, and customer support staff — are already among the most vulnerable.\n\nPeter Orszag, CEO of Lazard and former director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Obama, sees a similar risk.\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" this week, Orszag said that if AI delivers on its promise, there's likely to be a jobs crisis.\n\n\"Labor markets deal well with small problems that happen fast or big problems that happen slow. They do not deal well with big shocks that happen quickly,\" he said.\n\nAbramova said that the social risks extend far beyond unemployment numbers.\n\n\"History shows social strain emerges when the pace of economic change overtakes institutions' capacity to support displaced workers,\" she said.\n\nShe pointed to the UK's Enclosure Acts, which displaced tens of thousands of small farmers from common land, sparking riots and mass migration, and to the 1980s coal pit closures, which wiped out mining communities almost overnight and triggered years of strikes and political upheaval.\n\nBusiness leaders are divided over AI's impact on jobs, with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Ford CEO Jim Farley warning of widespread white-collar displacement, while Elon Musk, JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon, and OpenAI's Sam Altman have predicted varying outcomes, ranging from significant disruption to long-term prosperity.\n\nOthers, such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Yann LeCun — Meta's outgoing chief AI scientist — say AI will transform work rather than erase it.\n\n\"It's very likely that the companies that use AI first, that use robotics technology first, will be the most successful first, and they will end up hiring more people,\" Huang said in late October.\n\n\"You're going to lose your job not to somebody — not to a robot, you're going to lose your job to somebody who uses a robot. You're going to lose your job to somebody who uses AI,\" he added.\n\nIf governments and employers fail to prepare, Abramova said she expects widening inequality, persistent unemployment, falling consumer demand, rising political anger, and even expanding surveillance as leaders try to contain discontent.\n\nIn extreme cases, she warned, democratic norms can erode.\n\nBut she also said that the worst outcomes aren't inevitable.\n\nThe alternative is worker-augmenting AI: systems where machines handle data-intensive tasks while humans retain judgment, ethics, and client relationships. That shift will require regulatory incentives that reward firms for responsible oversight, not just rapid headcount reduction.\n\n\"Without major support,\" Orszag said, \"many displaced workers risk long-term underemployment.\"",

    "fullText": "If you're anything like me, your first thought when you heard Netflix was trying to buy Warner Bros. was probably, \"What's going to happen to my beloved 'Heated Rivalry'?\"\n\n\"Heated Rivalry\" is a series airing on HBO in the US and Crave in Canada that's inspired by Rachel Reid's romance novel of the same name. It's become an instant hit, beloved by fans for its steamy romance about hockey phenoms Shane Hollander and Ilya Rozanov.\n\nShane and Ilya were cast as rivals from the moment they met at junior championships. Shane is the Canadian good guy beloved by the entire NHL, while Ilya is the Russian bad boy unafraid to make enemies. In the rink, they're bitter rivals, but off the ice, Shane and Ilya have been drawn to each other like magnets since they were teens. Their undeniable chemistry leads to a secret affair that has the potential to derail both of their hockey careers.\n\nSeason one of the show is set to have six episodes, with new episodes releasing on Fridays. I can't make the wait for new episodes any shorter, but reading other queer sports romance books might make the time pass a little faster.\n\nRead on to check out other books fans of \"Heated Rivalry\" will love.\n\nI must confess, dear reader, that I skipped the first installment of Rachel Reid's \"Game Changers\" series so I could read \"Heated Rivalry\" to catch up with the TV show.\n\nHowever, when I finished the book and was desperate for more of Shane and Ilya's world, I went back to read \"Game Changer.\" The book is the focus of episode three of \"Heated Rivalry,\" so it's definitely worth reading if you like the show.\n\nIn the novel, Scott Hunter, the captain of the New York Admirals, has been off his game. Then, he wanders into a smoothie shop and lays eyes on Kip Grady, the cute guy behind the counter, and everything changes.\n\nKip's life has been at a standstill. He doesn't think there's any chance the sexy hockey player would give him the time of day, but then Scott invites him back to his penthouse, bringing excitement to his mundane life.\n\nKip and Scott are immediately smitten with each other, falling faster than either of them anticipated. At first, their hidden love affair feels exciting, but the thrill of being Scott's secret starts to wear on Kip. He wants all of Scott, but will Scott be willing to risk potential ramifications to his career if he makes their relationship public?\n\nIn \"Calling the Shots\" by Kelly Farmer, two hockey coaches will have to see if they're willing to put themselves out there for a chance at love.\n\nWhen Regan Lane is hired as the head coach for the Boston Ice, she makes a show of announcing her team will be the professional women's hockey champions. Regan is known for her confidence and big mouth, so her proclamation is par for the course.\n\nNo one is less surprised by Regan's statement than Tierney McGovern, the head coach of Boston's rival, the New York Lady Libertys. Tierney knows Regan is all talk from personal experience, as Regan left her stranded after a weeklong love affair.\n\nBoth are determined to lead their team to victories and crush the other. However, as they meet each other across the ice, they may find they have unfinished business.\n\nConnor Kennedy is a hockey legend. He followed in his NHL superstar father's footsteps, and throughout his own career, he became the first draft pick, Rookie of the Year, MVP several times over, and captain of his team.\n\nAnd Gavin Marshal can't stand him.\n\nEven though Gavin's had his own success on the rink, he hates feeling like he's living in Connor's shadow. He's dreading having to work with Connor on the Olympic hockey team, and he thinks things can't get any worse when he finds out he has to room with Connor throughout the games.\n\nHowever, to both their surprise, the hours they spend alone in their room help both Connor and Gavin see each other in a different light. Before they know it, they're on the verge of giving in to an attraction that could change everything in \"The Kennedy Rule\" by K.C. Carmichael.\n\nBestselling authors Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy teamed up to write \"Him.\"\n\nJamie Canning and Ryan Wesley were best friends until an alcohol-induced bet took things to a new level when they were 18. Ryan cut Jamie off without a word, immediately regretting putting his straight best friend in a situation he wouldn't have wanted sober. Jamie, though, misses Ryan, and he doesn't understand why one weird night had to end their friendship.\n\nThey go four years without seeing each other, reuniting to play against each other at the hockey college championships in their senior year. Ryan had big plans to apologize, but when they finally reunite, all he can think of is that his crush on Jamie is worse than ever.\n\nWhen the pair find themselves back at camp to coach alongside each other, Ryan isn't sure how he's going to make it six weeks without revealing his attraction. He might find, though, that he isn't the only one with long-buried feelings.\n\nPhoebe Matthews, 22, has looked up to Grace Henderson for years. At only 26, Grace has been playing for the US Women's National Team since she was 16, and she's already solidified her status as a legend.\n\nWhen Grace is injured, her team brings in Phoebe to fill her spot while she recovers. Grace is prepared to loathe her newfound rival, but instead she finds herself drawn to the goofy rookie.\n\nGrace is thrilled when Phoebe accepts her advances, thinking a friends-with-benefits arrangement will be perfect for them both. Phoebe, though, has different ideas about their relationship, developing feelings for Grace quickly.\n\nAs the pair find a way to work together on the field, they'll have to decide if they want to put their teamwork skills to work as a couple as well in Meryl Wilsner's \"Cleat Cute.\"\n\nLucas is the last person George wants to go to for help, but he doesn't have a choice in \"See You at the Finish Line\" by Zac Hammett.\n\nThe Cambridge rowing teammates have loathed each other since almost the moment they met, but when George, an American who got an athletic scholarship, finds himself flailing academically, he's willing to put aside their differences if hardworking Lucas helps him pull his grades up.\n\nLucas begrudgingly agrees, but only on the condition that George teaches him how to flirt so he can finally make a move on Amir, whom he has been crushing on for ages.\n\nHowever, George and Lucas find themselves growing closer over late-night study sessions and flirting lessons, leaving them wondering if the tension between them could become something more.\n\nIt's a good time to read the novel, as Noho Film and Television will be adapting \"See You at the Finish Line\" into a TV series.\n\n\"Like Real People Do\" by E.L. Massey is a sweet and funny friends-to-lovers romance set against the backdrop of professional hockey.\n\nTo the world, Alexander Price is a classic brash athlete, accompanying his hockey skills and status as the youngest NHL captain in history with a confidence that borders on cockiness. Behind closed doors, Alex is an anxious, closeted gay teen who hopes people won't see through the persona he's created for himself.\n\nElijah Rodriguez might not be living his career dreams, as the 18-year-old's hope of becoming an Olympic figure skater ended after a debilitating injury, but he's not living in secret. He's been out for four years, and as a vlogger, he uses his platform to disavow bigoted celebrities.\n\nAlex and Elijah seem like the last pair that would be pals, but after a tense meet-cute, they become fast friends. For Alex, though, keeping his true self a secret will be harder than ever as he falls in love with his best friend.\n\nKhadijah Upton can't wait for her first day as an athletic trainer with the Atlanta Cannons. However, imagine her shock when she arrives at work and sees Shae Harris, the sexy stranger who helped her celebrate her new job with a one-night stand.\n\nKhadijah isn't interested in mixing business and pleasure, especially because Shae is known to be a player. Shae gets harder and harder to resist, though, especially when she shows sides of herself to Khadijah that she usually keeps private.\n\nTheir chemistry is undeniable, but Khadijah will have to decide if taking a real chance with Shae is worth the risk to her job and her heart in \"Love and Sportsball\" by Meka James.\n\nIn Tal Bauer's \"The Jock,\" Wes Van de Hoek has the world at his fingertips. After earning a scholarship to play tight end at the top state school in Texas, Wes has become one of the best college football players in the country, and as captain, his team looks to him for leadership and guidance.\n\nA future in the NFL is Wes' to lose, but there's just one problem: Justin.\n\nOver the summer, Wes crossed paths with football non-fan Justin, and despite their differences, their connection was instantaneous. Even though their love affair is secret, the proof of how Justin improves Wes' life is everywhere, including on the field. He's at the top of his game, and he knows it's because of Justin.\n\nStill, keeping their relationship a secret becomes increasingly difficult as Wes' career takes off, especially when Wes realizes he would trade it all for a chance to truly be with Justin.\n\nThe last thing soccer legend Gavin Hayes wants to deal with at the end of his career is a young hotshot. To make matters worse, said hotshot, Oliver Bergman, is Gavin's nightmare: enthusiastic, beloved by the team, and annoyingly handsome.\n\nGavin is prepared to keep yucking Oliver's yum until he retires, but their coach has other plans when he makes them co-captains and demands they get along or risk losing their positions.\n\nThe teammates will have to play nice for the sake of their team, but as they spend more time together, Gavin and Oliver may realize the tension between them has nothing to do with soccer in \"Everything for You\" by Chloe Liese.\n\nIn the sequel to Riley Hart's \"The End Game,\" Jeremy and Darren didn't expect to find a spark at their best friend's wedding.\n\nJeremy is fresh from a divorce, and he finds himself opening up about his experience with Darren, a straight quarterback for the Atlanta Lightning, at the nuptials. They strike up an unlikely friendship, going from chatting at the wedding to texting at all hours of the night.\n\nWhen Jeremy visits Darren in Atlanta, their friendship becomes more. Darren has no problem coming to terms with his bisexuality, but the longtime bachelor is shocked to find himself dreaming of a life with Jeremy.

    "fullText": "Every year, I tape all the Christmas cards I receive to the interior side of my front door. As I walk past my entryway, it's nice to see the smiling faces of friends and family. Sometimes I re-read the little updates some people include. Plus, the colorful designs make the house feel a little more festive.\n\nBut while most people recycle the cards when the season is over, I carefully untape each card and file them away. I've got nearly a decade's worth of cards, packed away and waiting until the day, years from now, I'll sort them by sender, put them in albums, and give them back.\n\nMy plan has always been to wait until the oldest cards from each sender are 30 years old. It's long enough for life to completely change and for mementos to really feel like something really special. (I've been collecting them for eight years; most of my friends and family have a short 22 years to wait for their memory book.)\n\nI'm not necessarily strict on this 30-year deadline. For friends with kids, I might give them their cards back when their youngest graduates from high school. For older or sick loved ones, I'll present their cards much sooner, so they can enjoy their memories while they're well enough to do so.\n\nBut no matter the date, I love imagining my family members and longtime friends one day looking through their old cards, re-reading their \"annual update\" paragraphs from decades past, and admiring their youthful photos.\n\nI think about one friend, who has three little girls, looking at her card from 2024 one day in the future, with her then-grown daughters. \"Look how little you were!\" she'll say to her 30-something daughters, who'd be home visiting for Christmas. I imagine one of my neighbor friends showing her daughter their 2021 card, the year they announced she was expecting. I picture my sister-in-law tracing the shape of her then-puppy, which she'd included on her 2019 card.\n\nIt all started in 2018, the year I got married. I was thrilled to create and send out my first Christmas cards as a newly formed family of two. I had carefully designed it online with a picture from my wedding and a card template. When I showed my mom the finished product, she smiled, sighed, and said she wished she'd saved the cards she sent out when I was growing up.\n\nShe recalled buying a box of cards every year at the stationery store (she'd always let me pick out the design) and printing out copies of our favorite picture from the year, before we'd spend hours writing in and addressing the cards. But she never thought to save a card and photo for us to keep. \"It would've been so fun to look through those now,\" she said.\n\nShe said she wished she could ask someone for the card back, but who would have kept, and kept track of, a Christmas card from 20 years ago?\n\nOf course, I know that some people do keep all their own holiday cards, but lots of people (like my mom) don't think about it. Others might try to keep at least one from every year, but might lose track of them over the years. It occurred to me: Maybe I could be the one to keep track of them all. I could be the keeper of memories from Christmases past. I could bear the responsibility of keeping track of our pasts, our youths, our memories.\n\nAnd one day, give my favorite people a totally amazing present.\n\nI'll admit, collecting decades' worth of holiday cards will take a long time. But the gift is meaningful, and it's nearly free. It's made with holiday cards that are already sent to me — and reusing! — and while I do plan to buy photo books to place them in, I've got tons of time to bargain hunt.\n\nI love saving these holiday cards and thinking about the joy they'll bring my loved ones someday. In the meantime, I also enjoy looking through them.\n\nWhen I put my latest batch of cards in the accordion folder in a slot labeled for the year, I shuffle through some old cards from years past. My oldest cards are from 2018, not that old, but it's great looking through photos of friends, thinking about all the great people in my life.\n\nEvery year, I look through cards from my grandparents and other family, who have since passed. I know they won't receive their holiday cards when I sit down to package them all up one day. But I get a lot of joy in seeing them.\n\nAnd every year, I reflect on spending time with my mom, writing cards to loved ones, and enjoying the time we spent together. I wished someone had kept my holiday cards, but collecting others' is even better.",

    "fullText": "I recently moved from Southern California to the more chilly and gloomy Bay Area. In other words, I was in dire need of a good winter coat.\n\nSo, I turned to three trusted Gap Inc. retailers — Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy — to find a one that'll keep me warm throughout this season and beyond.\n\nI compared similar styles based on the design, fabric, price, and overall quality. Here's how it went.\n\nI started my search for a stylish and well-constructed peacoat at Gap.\n\nWhen I walked in, I appreciated that the store was easy to navigate and neatly organized. Plus, I found the coat I was looking for almost immediately.\n\nI tried on the wool-blend wrap coat and could tell right away that it offered a nice shape and structured fit that would fit easily over layers.\n\nI liked the thick-notch lapels, and thought the material (52% recycled wool, 40% recycled polyester, 8% other) felt warm without being overly bulky. However, the wool blend felt a bit itchy, especially around the neck area where it directly touched my skin.\n\nPlus, there were no buttons and the pockets were hidden, making it look somewhat like a bathrobe.\n\nAlthough it was a good, basic option, I wanted something with a little more flair. I also had a hard time justifying the price of $248 for a coat that was 40% polyester.\n\nAfter striking out at Gap, I decided to try Banana Republic for another option. The store was neatly organized, and I was able to locate a black peacoat easily.\n\nWhen I saw the $550 price tag on the Italian-wool cashmere wrap coat, I thought, \"There is absolutely no way I would pay that much for a coat.\" But after trying it on, I reconsidered.\n\nI could immediately tell that the quality of the material (made with 91% wool, 6% cashmere, and 3% other materials) was thick and warm, with no polyester in sight. The inside lining was also silky and smooth, and the overall fabric felt soft and comfortable without itching.\n\nI also loved the overall design of this coat. The pointed collar and large pockets added chic touches that were flattering yet functional.\n\nThis try-on reminded me that it's important to invest in pieces that will actually last a long time. I know this coat is something I would wear every winter for years.\n\nI'm a big fan of Old Navy because it offers both basic and trending styles for an approachable price.\n\nHowever, my local Old Navy was less organized than the other stores I visited, so it took me a bit longer to find a black peacoat. Thankfully, I was able to find one and brought it to the fitting room.\n\nThe first thing I noticed when trying on the oversized twill overcoat is that it didn't have a waist tie, which, to me, feels like a must for adding shape and style to any peacoat.\n\nThe coat was also made of 100% recycled polyester, so I'm not sure how warm it would actually keep me during winter. The fabric also felt less flexible than the others I tried on, leaving less room for layers underneath.\n\nI did like the overall style, though — it had a spread lapel and the buttons featured an eye-catching texture.\n\nThis was my least favorite coat out of the three, but for $90, I think it's a solid option for anyone shopping on a budget.\n\nOverall, the Banana Republic coat impressed me most, thanks to its durable fabric blend, comfortable fit, and elegant design.\n\nThis shopping day reminded me that high-quality staple pieces are worth investing in.",

    "description": "Kirsten Hurley was juggling a full-time leadership role and caring for her autistic brothers until burnout forced her to slow down and reset.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kirsten Hurley, a 44-year-old leadership coach based in London. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nLast year, I was on course to establish myself as a successful businesswoman in the tech sales space. Then, burnout stopped me in my tracks.\n\nWith my parents aging, I've had to do more caretaking for my autistic twin brothers in their adulthood. As the problem-solving demands of caring for them increased, it took away from my ability to do well at work.\n\nI couldn't solve problems that I usually had no issue navigating. I felt overwhelmed and hopeless. I'd ignored physical signs like migraines, fatigue, and chronic pain. I thought my burnout was something I could solve on my own, but I turned into my own worst enemy with it.\n\nI had some savings to live on, and the summer of last year, I quit my job. It was the start to discovering how I could lead a healthy life, pursue fulfilling work, and still manage to pay the bills.\n\nMy managing director role started in 2020, and I loved the team I worked with. During my burnout phase, I tried to stay at work and medicate myself with expensive supplements, caffeine, over-exercising, and even shopping and going on holidays. Despite my efforts, I couldn't stop feeling like my team, my family, and my friends all needed better from me.\n\nThere were responsibilities I physically couldn't keep up with because I'd constantly have migraines. I was reacting negatively to situations I'd always approached with a solution, and had let cynicism really creep into my thoughts and actions.\n\nWhen I decided to quit, I was honest with my team about why I was leaving. I knew I wasn't doing a good job for them.\n\nAlmost immediately, I started to regret my decision. I'd see on LinkedIn or hear in conversations with friends that people were attending conferences, events, and dinners, and I had nothing to do. I felt a real sense of loss at that point.\n\nHowever, I knew I needed this break. Once I had budgeted my finances to determine exactly how long I could take it, I had to force myself to put those feelings of regret and loss to bed and get comfortable with my new normal.\n\nThere are numerous books and advice available about burnout recovery, and I tried to read about it, but sometimes it ended up being a tool I used to beat myself up.\n\nI fell into a research trap of reading about and trying cures that worked for someone else in a completely different situation. I'd get so upset because the thing I'd tried wasn't working. I had to stop researching because maybe those solutions were never going to work for me, and I felt so awful when they wouldn't.\n\nWhen I was deciding to quit my job, I needed my partner to validate me and say, \"If you let go, it's OK. I'm going to catch you.\" Ultimately, that was what got me to my decision.\n\nI prioritized catching up on my sleep and started swimming again because that was super meditative for me. I went on long walks with my partner and our dog. Sometimes, we'd talk; other times, we'd be quiet together because I was learning to be peaceful in my brain.\n\nSome things went away almost instantly, such as the aches and pains in my body, and I experienced far fewer migraines. But the general sense of fatigue or malaise hung around for a few months before I felt more like myself again.\n\nMy brothers have very different needs, and I worked with my dad on improving their care plans during my break. I recognized that I wasn't good at communicating assertively when speaking with their support workers, and I learned this because I took a coaching course about compassionate leadership.\n\nThe course helped me recognize that I didn't have the words to describe what I was going through or needed help with because I'd never taken the time to communicate with someone about it before.\n\nOnce I became better at communicating, we were able to get out of the loop of repeating the same failed care plans and being confused that we weren't getting results.\n\nI didn't think about my next career steps until January. I was scared of falling into another job or career and potentially repeating the same mistakes again.\n\nI thought about starting my own business. I liked that I could prioritize my brothers when they needed me because I'd be managing my own workload. Some people said that being self-employed could drain more of my energy, but flexibility is now the most important thing to me.\n\nI decided to become a compassionate leadership coach myself, and I'm working on finding my work-life balance. I feel passionate about helping others, including caregivers, to avoid the same burnout experiences I had.\n\nWith hindsight, I can see that I was holding myself to standards that were no longer realistic, given how my responsibilities had expanded. I needed to recalibrate my approach to work and what I expected of myself to finally understand the difference between high standards and sustainable ones.",

    "title": "From McKinsey to PwC, here's how elite consulting firms are racing to hire engineers — and train everyone else in AI",
    "description": "Business Insider spoke to nine executives and industry insiders about how consulting's talent recruitment is changing.",
    "fullText": "AI is pushing consultants to their biggest-ever talent overhaul.\n\nAs firms shift from slide decks and advisory work to multi-year AI-driven transformation projects, the profile of the ideal consultant at firms like Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey, and PwC is changing.\n\n\"Going to a client and purely proposing an army of consultants doesn't really work anymore,\" Gert De Geyter, a former AI lead at Deloitte US, told Business Insider.\n\nInstead of the \"pure traditional consultant,\" firms are now looking for a blend of \"generalists and technical experts,\" said De Geyter, who left the firm in July to join AI startup Teragonia.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to nine executives and industry insiders to understand how consulting firms are hiring, retraining, and redefining their workforces to meet the moment.\n\nThe work that consultants do is changing. Straight advisory projects are being replaced with building, implementing, and maintaining tools for companies, requiring technology expertise over research skills.\n\nHiring data reveals how aggressively top firms have been expanding their technologist ranks. Accenture's latest annual report shows it added nearly 40,000 AI and data professionals in the last two years. They now account for roughly 10% of its global head count. EY has added 61,000 technologists since 2023, according to its latest annual report.\n\nAt McKinsey, the \"AI engineer\" is the fastest-growing non-entry-level role, followed by procurement officer, data scientist, and software engineer, according to workforce intelligence company Revelio Labs.\n\nAt Boston Consulting Group, software engineers, frontend developers, and Python developers are the fastest-growing entry-level roles.\n\nBCG, which brought on 1,000 employees last year, has ramped up hiring technologists since launching its tech and AI arm, BCG X, in late 2022.\n\n\"We're essentially building a tech company inside a consulting firm,\" said Sylvain Duranton, Global Leader of BCG X. \"Our job has always been to help companies transform. But tech has become so critical to transformation that we needed to have a grip on it ourselves.\"\n\nIts regular consulting division is also adopting a more tech-centric mentality.\n\nScott Wilder, a BCG partner and managing director, told Business Insider that a new team, called \"forward deployed consultants,\" is rising through the ranks. It takes inspiration from a software engineering role popularized by Palantir, Wilder said.\n\nThese consultants are vibe-coding and building tools on client projects, he said. When one of these tools is a hit, it goes back to the R&D team and becomes a broader tool that everyone can use.\n\nFor firms like McKinsey and BCG, the must-have hire in the AI era isn't a pure engineer or a pure consultant — it's someone who can move between both worlds.\n\n\"What we want to be able to do is find those people that actually have a propensity to either be this great McKinsey consultant, and or a great technologist, and then groom them to be both,\" Alex Singla, a senior partner at McKinsey who co-leads its AI arm, QuantumBlack, told Business Insider.\n\nHe added that candidates also want hybrid roles: Many don't want to spend years building products for a cloud company like AWS, nor do they want to be traditional consultants.\n\nSingla said McKinsey is looking for \"5Xers — they're deep in one thing, but can do three or four different things well.\"\n\nQuantumBlack, with its 1,700-person team, drives all of McKinsey's AI initiatives, which account for 40% of the firm's work, but McKinsey's technical talent isn't limited to that group, Singla said. There are about 3,500 people building internal technology for McKinsey, and another 4,000 to 5,000 consultants who are leading the technical work from the business side, but don't necessarily have technical expertise.\n\nThe consulting talent landscape has been in flux since the pandemic, when a surge in demand prompted top firms to aggressively staff up. As that boom faded and demand for advisory work slowed, many firms found themselves overstaffed, triggering layoffs and a more selective approach to hiring.\n\nAmid the shifting market, the traditional pyramid model — built on large cohorts of junior consultants — started to recalibrate as firms focused on roles that deliver value over manpower. That focus has only sharpened with the rise of AI, prompting firms to invest heavily in upskilling their existing workforces.\n\n\"Everyone is reckoning with the fact that AI has exploded onto the scene,\" Saurabh Sarbaliya, PwC's AI Lead, told Business Insider.\n\n\"The demand for people who can make AI work in the enterprise is only going to grow — but there just aren't enough experts. So you have to focus on upskilling your existing workforce,\" he said.\n\nAt KPMG, Sam Gloede, the firm's global trusted AI leader, said it is prioritizing upskilling over hiring.\n\n\"There is not a massive change in our workforce,\" Gloede said. \"It's just a focus on upskilling, literacy, and learning.\"\n\nEY is taking a similar approach and prioritizing the AI capabilities of its employees, Imgard Naudin ten Cate, EY's global leader of talent acquisition, told Business Insider.\n\nIn October, EY held a two-week learning event to teach employees to build AI agents for use in their day-to-day work. The firm has also rolled out 15-hour courses on topics including AI engineering, applied AI, and AI compliance.\n\nNearly 100,000 employees — roughly a quarter of the workforce — have earned a digital \"AI badge\" for completing one of the courses, said Simon Brown, EY's global learning and development leader. The initiative has been \"a phenomenal way at scale to build deep AI knowledge,\" he added.\n\nTechnologist roles are in high demand, but don't expect a team of hoodie-wearing Silicon Valley types when your company hires consultants. Most in the industry are still generalists with strong problem-solving and communication skills — and they'll likely show up in a suit.\n\nEven as firms hire more technologists, most consulting work still doesn't require deep engineering expertise. Traditional consulting roles at top firms are still on the rise, growing from 250,000 globally in 2022 to 340,000 in 2024, according to Revelio Labs.\n\n\"A lot of the clients are still just dipping their toes in the AI pond, so over-engineering solutions for them doesn't work,\" said de Geyter, the former AI lead at Deloitte US. \"It's a lot more helpful that someone supports them with setting up the right data governance so they can get ready for AI solutions down the line.\"\n\nA senior software engineer at Deloitte, who requested anonymity as they are not permitted to speak to the media, told Business Insider that the technical literacy of most employees is improving, but remains in a \"very nascent state.\"\n\n\"They're looking less for people who know the inners of how these black box models work or could train one themselves, and more at people who can quickly leverage them for a specific solution set,\" the person said.\n\nStill, they warned that the current skill level poses a strategic risk: \"We can't let it continue for too long.\"\n\nJim Rowan, head of AI at Deloitte US, told Business Insider that its employees have \"the latest technologies and certifications to effectively work with machines and unlock even more impactful business outcomes for clients.\" Deloitte is not just hiring more data engineers and technologists, but \"actively investing\" in upskilling its workforce, Rowan said.\n\nSeveral leaders told Business Insider that soft skills are becoming more relevant now that AI can perform specific quantitative tasks.\n\n\"When we get asked a question of what we are looking for when we recruit, the core fundamental thing is actually attitude,\" Niale Cleobury, KPMG's AI workforce lead, said. Communication, collaboration, and agile learning — \"the sort of things AI can't really do\" — are the standout qualities, he said.\n\nMcKinsey is still active on college campuses recruiting undergraduates, MBAs, and PhDs, said Kate Smaje, McKinsey's global leader of technology and AI.\n\nIn its screening process, McKinsey emphasizes elements of judgment and conceptual thinking in problem-solving, resilience, and the ability to learn quickly.\n\nThe ability to build relationships and the core EQ leadership qualities can be \"fairy dust\" on top of what you can do analytically that will now set you apart, said Smaje.\n\n\"What we really hire for is voracious learners, people who are curious about the world and have the ability to learn, unlearn, and relearn,\" she said. \"Those are the people we really want.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Here are some cures for burnout from people with firsthand experience dealing with it.",
    "fullText": "It's been that kind of year. Regardless of your industry, 2025 has likely been a hectic one for you. A combination of a new administration, a volatile stock market, and the ongoing disruption of AI has left just about everybody scrambling.\n\nAs the year winds down and some of us (hopefully) can ease off the gas pedal, it's important to take stock of how we're doing. For many, that means acknowledging burnout.\n\nSo what do you do if that's the case? Business Insider embarked on a five-part series, The Burnout Cure, to unpack the issue. Five individuals who felt burned out detailed how they overcame it.\n\nOne important takeaway: Burnout isn't something you can just power through.\n\nA couple of weeks off or deciding to \"just push through this quarter\" won't solve the problem. Instead, actual lifestyle changes are necessary.\n\nIt's OK to be selfish: When Kristi Coulter reached her breaking point as an Amazon executive, she made a new rule: only accept opportunities at work that offered a clear benefit to her, or were important to her boss. Did the world come crashing down as she turned stuff down? No. In fact, Coulter found she was more engaged and effective at the things she said yes to.\n\nBurnout isn't exclusive to the workplace. For some, finding a job can be just as brutal as having one. Kirsten Bradford spent up to eight hours a day for over a year looking for a job. But the constant rejection seeped into her personal life, eventually causing her son to notice. She's now put guardrails around how long she spends job hunting every day.\n\nCuring it once doesn't mean it won't return. Maybe you've already overcome burnout. Congrats! Just don't get comfortable. Natalie Holloway quit her advertising job to go on a burnout recovery trip. While abroad, she came up with an idea for a side hustle that evolved into her dream career. But it wasn't long before her burnout returned.\n\nEven those who are acutely aware of burnout can still fall victim to it. If anyone should recognize burnout, it's Jan Gerber. He runs a $130,000-a-week burnout clinic for executives, founders, and ultra-high-net-worth individuals. But even seeing the issues every day didn't stop Gerber from getting burnt out.\n\nAbove all else, remember there is no one-size-fits-all solution. When Kirsten Hurley was facing burnout, she spent a lot of time researching different solutions. But instead of helping, she'd get more upset because the fixes didn't work for her. Ultimately, her partner's validation of her decision to quit was what she really needed to start her recovery process.",

    "title": "Laura Dern on her favorite David Lynch movie, taking a risk on 'Jurassic Park,' and growing up on a Martin Scorsese set",
    "description": "Laura Dern looks back on her career filled with classics like David Lynch's biggest movies and \"Jurassic Park.\"",
    "fullText": "Laura Dern was around 6 years old, watching her mother act on a film set, when she had a revelation.\n\nShe was tagging along on summer break while her mother, Diane Ladd, was shooting Martin Scorsese's 1974 romantic drama \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.\" On set, the legendary director gave Dern a front row seat to the action.\n\n\"My greatest memory is watching a scene between my mom and Ellen Burstyn in a bathroom. Marty cracked the door open and shot through the door, and he let me kneel down and watch as they improvised,\" Dern told Business Insider. \"And I thought to myself watching, 'Whatever that is that they're doing, I want to be part of that.'\"\n\nThe daughter of two famed actors, Ladd and Bruce Dern, she learned about moviemaking not only by watching her parents but also by studying the ultra-famous directors, such as Scorsese and Alfred Hitchcock, who were directing them.\n\nIt didn't take long for Dern to start landing roles of her own. By the time she was a teen, she'd become the muse of David Lynch, who cast her in three of his movies (and later, the limited series \"Twin Peaks: The Return\"), including classics like \"Blue Velvet\" and \"Wild at Heart.\" Steven Spielberg came calling when he needed a no-nonsense paleobotanist for his groundbreaking blockbuster, \"Jurassic Park.\"\n\nIn her over four-decade career, Dern, now 58, has played nearly every kind of role imaginable, from a \"Star Wars\" rebel leader (\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\") to an Emmy-winning performance as an over-the-top CEO mom (\"Big Little Lies\"). In 2020, she landed the ultimate career milestone, winning an Oscar for playing fierce divorce lawyer Nora Fanshaw in Noah Baumbach's \"Marriage Story.\"\n\nBut what's the secret to Dern's success? When asked how it's possible to continue such a varied and successful career after all these years, Dern deflects from her own talent, suggesting it comes down to simply having a great eye for working with the right directors.\n\n\"They have a mastery at storytelling that's unique only to them,\" Dern said of what she looks for in a director.\n\nThat's what drew her to \"Is This Thing On?,\" Bradley Cooper's latest directing effort, in theaters now. Though he's largely known as an actor, Cooper's two previous features, \"A Star is Born\" and \"Maestro,\" convinced Dern that he's also a visionary behind the camera.\n\n\"Having made three features, Bradley has shown a language of cinema to each that is wildly different,\" she said.\n\n\"Is This Thing On?\" tells the story of a relationship on the verge of collapse, exploring how each partner copes with the emotional fallout. For Alex (Will Arnett), that means sharing his struggles onstage via standup comedy. Meanwhile, Tess (Dern) sets out on her own path, with Dern delivering a moving performance that examines how there's still room for rediscovery in middle age, even if it means reevaluating who you love.\n\n\"It's such an intimate and honest movie where we get to explore the subtlety within relationships, which was really exciting,\" Dern said.\n\nIn Business Insider's latest \"Role Play\" interview, Dern delves into everything that excites her about her craft, from the David Lynch movie she can never forget to the moment she finally saw those CGI dinosaurs in \"Jurassic Park\" on screen.\n\nOne of the first times we see you on screen is as an extra in \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.\" You're on set because your mother starred in the movie. Did Scorsese just see you and put you in a scene?\n\nYes. I was probably 6 at the time. I think Marty was probably being nice putting me in a scene. I was sitting around on my summer break getting to watch the cinema hero with my mom, just watching them have the time of their lives together.\n\nIs it true that around the same time, your father was making \"Family Plot\" with Alfred Hitchcock?\n\nYeah, the same summer. I went from \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\" with mom to the set with dad, not knowing that I was observing heroes.\n\nHe had the prop department build me a mini director's chair and let me sit next to him and watch my dad.\n\nHitch also taught me how hilarious my dad was. When you're little, you don't know your parent in context to other people's experiences of them. My dad would make Hitch laugh so hard. It was beautiful to get to know that part of my dad through this filmmaker that loved him.\n\nIs there one movie you did with David Lynch that stands out the most?\n\n\"Inland Empire.\" They all stand out — every experience, every day, every hour, every minute with David stands out, and are the greatest moments of my life, no exaggeration — but \"Inland Empire\" was three years of often just the two of us with a Sony camcorder and no other crew. Sometimes, a crew of maybe three. Sometimes, a traditional movie set. Playing multiple characters. Sometimes simultaneously. It was just the most radical, bliss-filled, experimental acting gift of my life with my best friend.\n\nAnd then he wraps it all up by hanging out on the side of a street with a big \"For Your Consideration\" billboard of you as your Oscar campaign.\n\nI mean, it can't get any better than that!\n\nWas it hard to let go of the Lula character when \"Wild at Heart\" wrapped?\n\nI don't know that I completely ever did. There are some characters where there is an aspect to them that never leaves you, and she definitely gave me a sense of playfulness, sensuality, daring, and dreaming that were not necessarily parts of my nature that I had explored or knew. So every once in a while, this character becomes a wakeup call to yourself. David was the person in my life who knew parts of me before I had met them yet.\n\n\"Jurassic Park\" isn't just a classic work from Steven Spielberg. It's a landmark moment in movie history thanks to its then-novel uses of CGI. The greatest example of that is your reaction in the jeep to seeing the Brachiosaurus. We have evolved a lot since then in terms of where actors should look when acting across imaginary things, but for that movie, what direction did Steven give you to pull off that shot?\n\nI remember Steven realizing that Sam [Neill] and I were looking in different spots. That they would have to get specific for our eye line. So, someone got a giant rod, like an orange picker, and they drew a large \"X\" on a piece of paper with a Sharpie, put it on the rod, and stuck it high up in a tree so that Sam and I could have the same eye line. It was that raw.\n\nWas there doubt on the \"Jurassic Park\" set that any of what you were doing would work?\n\nOh yeah. For sure. Day one, when we were supposed to hear a distant, faint sound that could be the T-Rex, and we all had to listen to the sound at the same moment, Sir Richard Attenborough said, \"We're going to need a cue of some kind, there has to be something ominous about something in the distance and we're not sure we heard it,\" and Steven said, \"Don't worry, don't worry.\"\n\nThe camera rolled, and suddenly, with a megaphone in the middle of that moment, Steven sounded exactly like this, [lamely] \"Rooarrrr… Rooaaarrr.\" And Sir Richard looked at me and was like, \"Oh my god, I'm not sure about this!\" We had no idea.\n\nWe watched the movie together — Steven, myself, Jeff [Goldblum], and Sam [Neill], at Amblin with popcorn. Steven had just finished everything. And we were beside ourselves. Popcorn was flying everywhere. I was grabbing onto Steven, terrified. Mind blown.\n\nYour Oscar-winning performance in \"Marriage Story\" features a memorable monologue about marriage and how women are perceived in society, which came from many conversations with Noah Baumbach. How did that speech evolve into what we see on screen?\n\nIt was a yearlong process with Noah. We would spend hours just talking about relationships and marriage, the business of divorce, the manipulation that happens at the most delicate of moments in anyone's life when lawyers get involved.\n\nThen the day came when he said, \"I would love for you to read the script, I think I'm there,\" and I just wept. I thought it was one of the most beautiful things I had ever read.\n\nWhen you get to that point in the script where he's given your character this powerful monologue, what are you feeling? Is it terror? Is it excitement?\n\nExcitement. Because it made me laugh so hard. It's so honest. It's so direct about her perspective on women in the world and the difference between how a man or a woman is going to be treated in this circumstance.\n\nI believe you contributed one of the funniest lines to that monologue: That God \"didn't even do the fucking!\"\n\nI did. And I only say it because Noah's been so generous to bring that up. It's the great gift of working with the few directors who become family to you. He is so open and collaborative, like Bradley was, too. Like I had David for so many years in my life, Noah now feels like family.\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\n\"Is This Thing On?\" is in theaters now.",

    "title": "I made Ina Garten's homemade chicken stock and realized sometimes store-bought really isn't fine",
    "description": "Ina Garten's easy homemade chicken stock makes any soup taste incredible. There's a reason the Barefoot Contessa calls it \"liquid gold.\"",
    "fullText": "There are some store-bought ingredients — like puff pastry, mayonnaise, and ketchup — that Garten truly believes are \"more than fine,\" as she told Today in 2019.\n\nBut when it comes to chicken stock, Garten believes the ready-made version is pretty \"meh.\"\n\n\"I really prefer homemade chicken stock, but if you absolutely have to, just make sure it doesn't have a lot of salt in it,\" she told the site.\n\nI used store-bought stock to make Garten's winter minestrone soup and enjoyed the recipe, but it wasn't the broth that stood out to me — it was all the delicious veggies. So, when I decided to make more of Garten's soups this season, I knew I needed to make the stock from scratch.\n\n\"I think of homemade chicken stock as liquid gold,\" Garten writes in \"Go-to Dinners,\" her October 2022 cookbook. \"Nothing available on the market has the depth of flavor or richness of stock you've made yourself. It contributes such great body and aroma to so many dishes. Plus, having a big pot of chicken stock simmering away on my stove just makes me feel good.\"\n\nTo make Garten's homemade chicken stock, you'll need:\n\nWhenever I make one of Garten's recipes for the first time, I try to follow it to a T. But I should note that simmering the three roasting chickens for four hours will render them completely flavorless.\n\nIf you're uncomfortable wasting all that meat, you can always freeze the bones from your chicken and save them up for the stock, or take the chicken out once it's cooked through and let the aromatics continue to flavor the broth.\n\nThis recipe also provides you with a lot of stock — nearly nine quarts, to be exact. I've made two of Garten's soup recipes since whipping up her homemade chicken stock, and I still have three and a half quarts left in my freezer. You'll get more than a few meals out of it.\n\nMaking Garten's stock couldn't be simpler — you don't even have to peel anything. After I halved and quartered the veggies, per her instructions, I just threw all my ingredients into a 20-quart stockpot. Then, I added seven quarts of water and brought my pot to a boil (covering the pot will help speed this up).\n\nOnce my stock was bubbling, I removed the lid, lowered the heat, and let it simmer uncovered for about four hours — making sure to skim off any foam from the top. After allowing the stock to cool, I strained everything through a colander and stored the stock in freezer-safe containers.\n\nThe first recipe I made with Garten's homemade chicken stock was her ravioli en brodo, which appears in \"Go-To Dinners.\"\n\n\"Every country has its own chicken soup, and this one is classic Italian,\" Garten writes in the description. \"The key to its flavor is rich homemade chicken stock, plus lots of vegetables, good ravioli, and a final sprinkling of Parmesan and fresh dill.\"\n\nI've lost count of how many Barefoot Contessa recipes I've made over the past few years, but Garten's ravioli en brodo soup immediately shot to my top five — and it's all because of the homemade chicken stock. The lovely golden broth is so rich and comforting that you could drink it on its own. As my fiancé said after his first sip, it's truly \"exploding with flavor.\"\n\nThis soup is somehow both simple and sophisticated, and I know I'll be making it for my friends and family for years to come.\n\nGet the full recipe for Ina Garten's ravioli en brodo soup here.\n\nGarten's chicken pot pie soup, which appears in her 2020 cookbook \"Modern Comfort Food,\" was inspired by a dish she saw on an airport restaurant menu.\n\n\"It was actually harder to make than it sounded — my first few attempts just tasted like chicken pot pie filling, not soup,\" she writes in the recipe description. \"This one, though, hit all the right comforting notes, with good chicken stock, roasted chicken, and puff pastry croutons.\"\n\nThis is another contender for my all-time top Barefoot Contessa recipes. The silky and savory stock is the perfect vehicle for a recipe packed with hearty veggies, and Garten's buttery and flaky croutons — easily made with store-bought puff pastry — soak up so much of its delicious flavor.\n\nGet the full recipe for Ina Garten's chicken pot pie soup here.\n\nSoup has always been one of my favorite dishes — if you've read my past articles, you'll know I'm even in a group chat dedicated to sharing soup recipes and tips — so Garten's homemade chicken stock truly feels like a revelation.\n\nIt's extremely easy to make, infuses every dish with so much flavor, and you can store it in the freezer for up to six months. What's not to love?\n\nGarten's homemade chicken stock is an investment I can guarantee will always pay off.",

    "title": "I flew Breeze Airways for the first time. Bad reviews worried me, but my experience with the low-cost airline was flawless.",
    "description": "I flew Breeze Airways with my family of five over the holidays. I was surprised by the lower fares and easy travel experience with the budget airline.",
    "fullText": "As a family of five who travels a lot, I'm always looking for the best deal because air travel can get expensive very quickly.\n\nWhen we planned a recent trip from Portland, Maine, to Pittsburgh over the holiday break, low-cost flights from Breeze Airways caught my eye.\n\nThey were also the only direct routes available, yet I was hesitant to book with the low-budget airline after reading negative online reviews that mentioned frustrations about delayed flights and hidden fees.\n\nI was already skeptical about traveling with my kids during peak travel season, but, left with no other option that fit our budget, I decided to give Breeze Airways a try. I'm glad I did.\n\nThough our tickets with Breeze Airways weren't cheap — we paid $1,790 for the five tickets plus two carry-ons — they were significantly cheaper than those of other airlines.\n\nOur options with other airlines had at least one stop (which I try to avoid when traveling with kids), and five tickets started at over $2,000.\n\nI purchased our tickets in July and chose the cheapest seats, which also had the most restrictions — no checked luggage, no carry-ons, a fee to select certain seats, and only one personal item allowed per person.\n\nEach carry-on costs us an extra $70 to fly with, so we only brought two — one for each adult.\n\nAll of us were allowed to bring a personal item for free, and for the kids, it was a small backpack filled with entertainment, such as stuffed animals and coloring books.\n\nBecause we were staying with family, I knew I could do laundry during our trip, which allowed us to travel with minimal luggage.\n\nI chose seats in row 24, the first row where you didn't have to pay to choose your seat, and within the \"family seating\" section to ensure that we could sit together at no additional cost.\n\nI was able to grab an entire row — two window seats, two aisles, and one middle. If I had wanted anything closer to the front, seats would've cost an extra $25 (or more) each.\n\nWhen we arrived at the airport for our outbound flight, I panicked because Breeze Airways was not showing on any of the departure screens, and my app said our gate was \"TBD.\"\n\nLuckily, an airport employee helped guide us to a specific gate, where Breeze usually operates. There we found our flight, which was listed as being on time.\n\nBoarding started soon after, and it was far more organized than other airlines I've flown with.\n\nThough families with kids were welcomed to board first, we stuck with our group so the kids could get as many wiggles out as possible before having to be seated for the flight.\n\nLuckily, we had no issues finding overhead space for our bags when boarding in group three.\n\nOnce on board, I was surprised at how new the plane felt. It had smooth leather seats, and the entire cabin appeared to be free from dings and dents.\n\nOur seats were comfortable for a short flight, though they barely reclined at all. We still had small tray tables that came in handy for my kids to color and play on.\n\nThe legroom was fine for me as a 5-foot-6-inch adult, and I was able to fit everyone's backpacks comfortably on the floor by our feet.\n\nThough there were no seatback screens for entertainment, I was prepared with sticker books and stuffed toys to keep our kids happy.\n\nDuring both flights, we were only served cups of water, and the snack cart didn't come out because there was significant turbulence.\n\nSince we were in the cheapest section, we would've had to purchase other drinks and any snacks. We weren't particularly bothered by this since our flights were only 1 hour and 20 minutes long.\n\nWe just packed snacks in the kids' backpacks and grabbed food at the airport before boarding, so everyone would be content.\n\nI've grown accustomed to flight delays in recent years, but both of our flights landed a little ahead of time, which was a pleasant surprise.\n\nMy family has flown with low-cost carriers before, trying both Frontier Airlines and Spirit.\n\nI've had good experiences with Frontier, though its flights often depart at odd hours from our closest airport. Looking back, taking a 5 a.m. flight to Miami with kids was not the best choice.\n\nOn one Spirit flight to Mexico, my husband and I experienced several delays and almost missed our connection, barely making it to the plane on time.\n\nThough I can't say with certainty that Breeze Airways is the best of the three, our one experience was significantly better than previous ones with budget airlines.\n\nThe company only flies from our local airport to about a dozen cities in the US, but I'm happy to consider Breeze Airways for future family travel.\n\nThe low-cost airline will be especially helpful during the holiday season, when we're bound to see our extended family in Pittsburgh.",

    "title": "After effectively killing a frigate program, the Navy is now pushing a new American-made 'Golden Fleet' frigate",
    "description": "The future small surface combatant ship will be built by Huntington Ingalls Industries and based on its Legends-class cutter used by the Coast Guard.",
    "fullText": "Following the cancellation of its last frigate program, the US Navy announced Friday that it is pursuing a new frigate based on an American-made design for President Donald Trump's Golden Fleet plan.\n\nThe decision by Navy Secretary John Phelan comes just weeks after the service canceled all future orders for the Constellation-class frigate, a project which was over-budget and delayed due to volatile design changes.\n\nIn a video message on Friday, Phelan said the new frigate, based on the Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) Legends-class national security cutter design, would be part of Trump's \"Golden Fleet\" and \"built on a proven American design, in American shipyards, with an American supply chain.\" Designs for the Constellation class were based on the Italian FREMM frigate design developed by shipbuilder Fincantieri.\n\nThe first new frigate hull is expected to launch in 2028, the Navy secretary added.\n\nHII will build the vessel. It said its shipbuilders \"will once again engage in construction activities alongside its destroyer and amphibious ship shipbuilding lines where the national security cutters were built, using the same sequence of build.\" The company is also working on the latest version of the Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, the America-class amphibious assault vessels, and the San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock ships.\n\nHII previously built 10 Legend-class cutters for the Coast Guard, with the final vessel delivered in October 2023.\n\nBasing the new frigate on an already complete design \"will allow the Navy and shipbuilders to reduce cost, schedule, and technical risk,\" Adm. Darryl Caudle, chief of naval operations, said.\n\nIt remains unclear what, if any, design changes have or will be made to the Legend-class cutter design for this new frigate. It is also unknown how many vessels will be built. Phelan said the Navy will build the first vessel using HII as the lead yard. Other yards may build follow-on ships.\n\nLate last month, Phelan said the Navy had a new framework that would put new classes of ships on a faster shipbuilding timeline after the cancellation of the Constellation-class frigate. The Constellation class, based on the Italian navy design, was originally expected to have roughly 80% commonality.\n\nRadical design changes weren't part of the plan, but plans change. That figure dropped to 15%, and the design changes to the Constellation ultimately led to its severe delays and cost overruns.\n\nTwo Constellation-class frigates are still under construction by Wisconsin-based shipbuilder Fincantieri Marinette Marine; however, 20 were originally ordered for $22 billion in 2020.",

    "title": "The Epstein files are set to come out today. Here's what could be inside.",
    "description": "The deadline for the Epstein files is here. The DOJ is obligated to make public its reams of information about Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.",
    "fullText": "More than six years after Jeffrey Epstein died in prison, the world is set to get a closer look into the well-connected financier's sex trafficking of young girls — and what the government did to stop it.\n\nIn November, President Donald Trump signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act after months of pressure from members of Congress, including some in his own party. The Justice Department was given 30 days from the law's passage to comply, setting a deadline of Friday, December 19.\n\nSo what are the chances the world will see the files, and what might they contain? Business Insider has answers to your most pressing questions.\n\nEpstein killed himself in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. He was known for rubbing elbows with powerful people — even after he was convicted of soliciting sex from a minor in 2008. Over the years, he has counted Trump, Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and other titans of finance, law, politics, and science among his acquaintances.\n\nWhile a past relationship with Epstein is no indication of wrongdoing, his victims and other members of the public have pushed for the disclosure in hopes that the DOJ's records might shed light on those relationships and law enforcement's handling of the case.\n\nIn recent months, the House Oversight Committee has made public Epstein-related documents it obtained through subpoenas, including emails provided by his estate and never-before-seen photos of some of Epstein's powerful acquaintances, including Trump, Bill Gates, Larry Summers, and Steve Bannon.\n\nThose disclosures have already led to some fallout. Summers, a former Treasury Secretary, has been barred from the American Economic Association for life and is no longer teaching classes at Harvard University, pending an investigation.\n\nOther documents have been made public over the years through the federal prosecution of Epstein's co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was found guilty of sex trafficking and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Civil lawsuits involving Epstein, Maxwell, banks affiliated with Epstein, and the US Virgin Islands government have shaken loose even more details about his life. Various drips and drabs have also entered the public domain through Freedom of Information Act requests, government reports, and an inquiry from the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nAll of that may pale in comparison to what the Justice Department has in its possession.\n\nThose could include more emails and text messages, as well as internal prosecutorial records. The Justice Department has overseen two different criminal investigations into Epstein's sexual abuse of teenage girls. The first took place in Florida and led to a widely criticized plea deal in 2008. The second was the Manhattan-based investigation, which led to Epstein's 2019 arrest and Maxwell's prosecution.\n\nDuring Epstein's 2019 arrest, the FBI searched his Manhattan townhouse and his home in the US Virgin Islands. In the process, they obtained more than 70 computers, iPads, and hard drives, along with financial documents and binders full of CDs.\n\nThose seized materials form the heart of the \"Epstein files,\" which could shed even more light on the deepest, darkest secrets of the notorious pedophile.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News on Friday morning, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the DOJ will not release its complete trove of documents on Friday as required by the legislation.\n\n\"I expect that we're going to release several hundred thousand documents today, and those documents will come in all different forms — photographs and other materials associated with the investigation into Mr. Epstein,\" Blanche said.\n\nYes! A whole bunch of stuff, including:\n\nBlanche told Fox News Friday morning that the Justice Department will likely release \"several hundred thousand more\" documents following the initial drop, out of concern for properly redacting victim information.\n\n\"I expect that we're going to release more documents over the next couple of weeks,\" Blanche said.\n\nOne reason for the delay may be the sheer number of documents they will have to get through — Epstein has been in their crosshairs for some 20 years.\n\n\"Nothing about this case has gone according to schedule,\" said David Boies, an attorney who represents dozens of Epstein victims.\n\nThe law only requires the Justice Department to make its records publicly available, letting other federal agencies with Epstein records off the hook.\n\nThe Treasury Department, for example, won't have to release its records related to Epstein's finances. A separate bill proposed by Sen. Ron Wyden would force more transparency there.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration maintains flight records that it has so far kept from the public. And to the degree that intelligence agencies like the CIA or the National Security Agency have anything, the bill doesn't cover them.\n\nThe Epstein Files Transparency Act permits the Justice Department to redact or withhold documents for victim privacy and for national security purposes.\n\nWell, sure, but there are limits.\n\nFour people who previously accessed the seized material told Business Insider that nothing in them indicated Epstein had any kind of domestic or foreign intelligence role. Nothing in the discovery process or court proceedings for Maxwell's criminal case involved records related to national security.\n\nFurthermore, the Epstein Files Transparency Act requires all redactions to be accompanied by a written justification submitted to Congress.\n\nIt also requires the Justice Department to produce material \"concerning the destruction, deletion, alteration, misplacement, or concealment\" of Epstein-related records — meaning Congress wants to know if there are signs of a cover-up.\n\nA provision in the law allows the Justice Department to withhold records that \"would jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution.\"\n\nDays before the bill's passage, Trump ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to open an investigation into the links between Epstein and JPMorgan Chase, as well as a slew of perceived political enemies. Bondi handed the investigation over to the US Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York.\n\nEven if the Justice Department withholds any of those records from the public, it's still required to hand them over to the House Oversight Committee, which subpoenaed them.\n\nAny perceived attempts by the Justice Department to use this investigation as a shield could lead to backlash from both Congress and members of the public. A number of Epstein's victims have pushed for the release of the files, seeking to understand more about the circumstances of their own abuse and the Justice Department's handling of the case.",

    "description": "Charisse Ellison has sons, aged 37 and 33, and a daughter, 4. She delivered the girl at 51 and compares her experiences as a younger and older mom.",
    "fullText": "This story is based on a conversation with Charisse Ellison, 55, a retired police officer from Queens, New York. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI first became pregnant at the age of 17, shortly before I graduated from high school in June 1988.\n\nThose days were different than now, and there was some shame around having a baby when you were young and unmarried. So, I hid my pregnancy for around five months until the cat got out of the bag. By the time I gave birth, I'd gained 75 pounds.\n\nMy son, Markeith, was born in November, and people were more accepting after he arrived. But I found it challenging as a first-time mom, especially because he cried a lot.\n\nI didn't know what I was doing at first. But you develop an ability to go with the flow, and things fall into place.\n\nStill, I didn't want motherhood to define my life. I went to school, even though it was hard to juggle studying with caring for Markeith.\n\nI waited five years before I became pregnant again because I was determined to complete my degree. Jevon was born in November 1993 when I was 23. By then, I was a single mom.\n\nMy friend took me to the hospital in a taxi. She came upstairs to the labor and delivery unit but had to leave to care for her child. So I gave birth on my own.\n\nI joined the Department of Transportation in 1994. The job was tough, but at least I had an amazing childcare provider at that time.\n\nIn 2000, I qualified as a police officer in the New York Police Department. I was there during 9/11 and called to the World Trade Center as a rookie.\n\nIn my 30s, I thought I was done with having kids. I considered having my tubes tied. But I was put off when a friend underwent the procedure and then regretted it.\n\nI met my husband in 2008, and we got married in 2010, three years before I retired from the police force. He was 41 years older than me, but we wanted to have a baby during our time together.\n\nWe got ready to do IVF because of our respective ages, but then we separated. Since I'd already started the process, I wanted to continue using someone else's sperm.\n\nI got pregnant on the third attempt in November 2020, and when I heard my daughter, Alina's, heartbeat on the sonogram, I could hardly believe it.\n\nSome of my friends thought I was crazy to become pregnant at 50. They didn't think I'd cope. But I proved them wrong.\n\nThe pregnancy was the easiest of the three, mostly because I didn't have morning sickness. I took the vitamins and continued my regular exercise routine of walking, only gaining 12 pounds.\n\nI gave birth to Alina in July 2021 at the age of 51. The labor pains were hard, and I needed an epidural at that time. But I fell in love the moment she was placed in my arms.\n\nThere were lots of ups and downs with a newborn. I'd gone nearly 30 years without hearing crying or changing diapers. At one point, I asked myself, \"What the hell did I do?\"\n\nLuckily, my sister moved in with me to help for the first six months. Alina began to sleep through the night, but I felt more tired than I was when the boys were babies.\n\nThis time, it was a very different ride. I was much slower both mentally and physically.\n\nWhen Alina was a toddler, it was a challenge to lift her in and out of the swings at the playground. I had a rotator cuff injury. I'd watch the younger moms picking up their kids and throwing them in the air — something I couldn't do.\n\nIt was lovely because nobody seemed to care about my age. I didn't mind if the occasional person mistook me for Alina's grandmother.\n\nShe's now in pre-K, and the other moms include me in everything. We just got back from a princess-themed brunch in the city.\n\nMy daughter is so lively and intelligent. She often uses long words and phrases. One of the main differences is that my sons didn't have access to technology when they were growing up. Alina will quote things she's seen on YouTube. \"If you learn patience, you'll feel better, Mommy,\" she said the other day.\n\nBut I do have my fears. I wonder about getting older and not seeing her grow up. People my age are passing away, and it's given me pause for thought. I have taken out several insurance policies to make sure Alina is OK for the future.\n\nShe is the apple of everybody's eye. Markeith and Jevon dote on their little sister. She brings joy to us all.",

    "description": "A source in the Security Service of Ukraine told Business Insider that the attack was carried out more than 1,240 miles away.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces used long-range drones to strike an oil tanker said to be part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" in the Mediterranean Sea for the first time, a security source told Business Insider on Friday.\n\nThe attack, carried out over 1,240 miles from Ukrainian territory, represents a dramatic expansion of Kyiv's push to target Russia's vast energy sector, a key source of revenue fueling its war machine.\n\nUkraine had previously limited its attacks to land-based targets, such as oil refineries and port infrastructure. In recent weeks, though, it has begun striking tankers in the Black Sea and facilities in the Caspian Sea — and now it's hitting targets in the Mediterranean.\n\nA source in the Security Service of Ukraine, the SBU, called the drone attack an \"unprecedented special operation\" that targeted and critically damaged the tanker Qendil. The source was only authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss military developments.\n\nThe SBU source said the Qendil wasn't carrying any oil cargo at the time of the attack, so there isn't any risk to the environment. Footage shows several explosions on the exterior of the tanker.\n\nPublicly available ship-tracking data show that the Qendil was sailing under the flag of Oman. It's unclear when the attack took place; the vessel last reported its location on Friday sailing off the coast of Libya in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nNeither Russia's defense ministry nor its US embassy immediately responded to a request for comment on the attack.\n\nUkraine has attacked at least four tankers, including the Qendil, that have been identified as belonging to the \"shadow fleet\" since late November. There are hundreds of vessels in the fleet, which Moscow relies on to transport oil and circumvent sanctions on its energy exports.\n\nRussia used the Qendil \"to circumvent sanctions and earn money that went to the war against Ukraine,\" the SBU source said in translated remarks shared with Business Insider, calling the ship a \"legitimate target\" for the SBU.\n\nThe enemy must understand that Ukraine will not stop and will beat him anywhere in the world, wherever he is,\" they added.\n\nSince August, Ukraine has stepped up its use of long-range drone strikes to target Russian energy infrastructure in an effort to squeeze a key source of revenue for Moscow. While the campaign initially focused on land-based facilities, Kyiv has recently expanded it to maritime targets, hitting oil tankers in the Black and Mediterranean seas and striking three oil platforms in the Caspian Sea.\n\nThe expansion to maritime targets appears to reflect a shift in Kyiv's strategy as it continues to press its international partners to be more aggressive in clamping down on Russian oil exports.\n\nUkrainian officials have described the ongoing deep-strike campaign as \"long-range\" sanctions against Moscow. These operations have been a bright spot for Kyiv as it faces incremental — but costly — Russian gains on the battlefield.",

    "title": "I'm a style editor who's obsessed with heels, and Inez makes some of the comfiest ones out there",
    "description": "Inez promises that they make truly comfortable heels and they couldn't be more correct. Here are our favorite styles and why we love them so much.",
    "fullText": "Anyone who knows me knows that I've made it a personal mission to find heels that are both genuinely comfortable and genuinely stylish. It's a quest I take a little too seriously — I've tested nearly every brand that claims to bridge that impossible gap, and I've paid for it with more blisters, ankle scrapes, and sore arches than I care to admit. When I wrote our guide to the most comfortable heels, I literally walked miles in dozens of pairs just to see which ones actually lived up to the hype.\n\nAll of that is to say: I don't hand out praise lightly. And that's why Inez stands out. Their heels look runway-worthy, but they're built with comfort features you can actually feel — plush, supportive insoles, discreet cushioning designed to absorb impact, and materials that make the shoes feel as good as they look. After all my testing, Inez is one of the few heel brands that truly delivers on both fronts.\n\nMost of the shoes retail for about $200-$300, and while that may seem steep at first, this luxury brand is worth the investment. Before Inez, I would spend way more than that on buying lots of cheaper pairs that were never comfortable. But these are shoes that I know I will have for a long, long time.\n\nHere are our top three styles, but read on to find in-depth reviews of these pairs and more.\n\nThis miraculously comfortable platform heel has quickly become one of my holy grail pieces for weddings. It's a towering four inches, but you won't feel the height at all.\n\nThis elegant boot has a 3.5-inch block heel, a sleek silhouette, and arch support all around. It's perfect for dressing up your fall outfits without sacrificing comfort.\n\nIf you're in the market for a pair of pumps to get you to formal work meetings, weddings, and everything in between, we highly recommend these supremely made shoes. Inez makes some of the most comfortable heels we've tried and these are no exception.\n\nI can't say enough great things about these platform heels. They tower at 3.9 inches, but the platform keeps the pitch shallow and the weight off of your toes.\n\nThe Camilla comes in many formalwear-ready colors, such as silver chrome, beige patent leather, and black lizard. When I wore them to a wedding, I was able to wear them for the full five hours of the ceremony and reception. This included a standing cocktail hour and a full two hours of dancing. At the end of the night, my feet were totally fine — not a blister or an ache to be felt.\n\nI'm a long-time fan of Inez, so trust me when I say that this is some of its best work. Just be aware that the footbed can run a little long, so you might want to size down a half-size.\n\nThis pick from Inez is one of our favorite heels we've ever tested. The suede exterior is luxurious and the footbed – like all of Inez's creations — is perfectly contoured. The heel is also 2.8 inches, which might seem like a lot, but it doesn't feel that way when you're wearing it.\n\nIt comes in a bunch of colors, from work-ready neutrals to party-ready purples (I'm obsessed with the orchid color pictured above). And there are three widths, which we love: slim, standard, and roomy. As far as fit, Inez says that it's best to go a half-size down in this style, which I agree with. Like most pumps or slingbacks, the slope of the shoe pushes your feet a little deeper into the toe, which means you might need a little less length in the footbed.\n\nThe only thing that slightly concerns me is that the backstrap has a bit of elastic that allows you to slip it on. I'm getting so much use out of these that I'm scared of the elastic stretching out and messing with the fit.\n\nPumps are difficult to get right. Unlike platforms or other kinds of creatively-designed shoes, there's no way of getting around the steep pitch. In fact, these are particularly steep. Aptly called the Alta, they have a towering heel height of 3.5 inches. You can get the style in a lower-height heel, called the Lola, if this sounds a little too tall for you. But don't be afraid to go with the higher heel. The shoes are far more comfortable than they look.\n\nAnd while I probably wouldn't recommend these for running around (you can literally run in some of Inez's highest heels, like the Pilar below), they are the ultimate secret weapon for feeling authoritative and stylish at work. Paired with one of the best suits for women, the Alta pumps make the ultimate power outfit.\n\nThe Paz is a chic, heeled ankle boot with a leg-elongating silhouette. Like all of Inez's shoes, this one is wildly comfortable for its heel height — so much so that writer Rebecca Strong named it one of the most comfortable boots she's ever tested. Here's what she had to say in that review:\n\n\" Magic — there's literally no other explanation for how these booties make my ultra-wide feet look so slim. Somehow, the \"snip\" toe offers ample room while still providing a tapered look that visually elongates my legs.\n\nThe fit also feels customized. The Inez Paz 70 is absurdly comfortable. I'll chalk that up to the proprietary plush insole, which offers plenty of cushioning and arch support — and the fact that the luxe suede upper has plenty of stretch to hug my foot like it was custom made.\"\n\nThe Paz 90 has the same elegant silhouette as the Paz 70, but it's 20 mm (or about ¾ of an inch) higher. You'd think this extra height might interfere with walkability, but it's still incredibly comfortable\n\nI named it one of the best ankle boots for women because of it's supreme combo of comfort and style. I love how the ankle shaft is tight to your leg, so it doesn't create any awkward gaps.\n\nIt also makes a great boot to pair with a skirt. Lots of short boots cut me off at the ankle, making my legs look shorter than they are. But this boot creates an elegant line, elongating your legs visually.\n\nThis chic knee-high boot comes in three materials: black calf leather, brown suede, and shiny brown leather that's textured like crocodile skin. I opted for the crocodile option, which definitely looks very high-fashion in person. I like the idea that as the leather bends and gets softer, the creases will fit in nicely with the outside texture.\n\nLike with the Pilar, the padded footbed on this shoe makes all the difference when it comes to comfort. They're super easy to walk in, even though the heel is 3-inches high. And like most of Inez's boots, these fit true to size so you won't have to worry about pinching or twisting due to sizing issues.\n\nThe one major issue that I had with this shoe is the height of the shaft. I'm five-foot-two, so my legs are a little shorter than average. This boot hit at the middle of my knee, which is a little unflattering. A knee-high boot should ideally hit right below the knee or a little lower. For context, I measured the shaft of these to be about 15-inches, which is about average for knee-high boots. But for my height, I prefer it to be around 13-inches.\n\nI've worked around this issue by pairing these with midi skirts that show off the boots while covering my knees. This is such a trendy way to wear boots that I don't mind. They also look pretty good with loose pants, but I avoid wearing them with mini skirts. And though there may not be different shaft heights available, there are two calf widths available. I opted for the standard calf version, which was a great fit.\n\nWhen I first saw this pair of boots, my wife had to basically pick my jaw up off the ground. I mean, they're utterly gorgeous, to say the least. They also come in wide calf and footbed sizing, which just made me even more sure that someone designed these special for me. I get so many compliments every time I wear them — to the point that I've been buying outfits specifically to pair with these boots!\n\nThe croc-embossed finish has a luxurious sheen to it that makes the boots look particularly elegant, and the texture and shine gives even the simplest sweater dress outfit a sophisticated flare. I love the brownish-burgundy pair I tested, but if you prefer a simpler look you can also opt for black leather or chestnut suede. Perhaps the biggest selling point was that I, a notorious heel hater, was able to wear these four hours on end while walking in the city thanks to the boots' well-constructed arch support.\n\nThe only drawback I can think of is one that every vertically challenged person who likes tall boots will understand, and that's the fact that they dig into the back of your knee on stairs. It's not uncommon for short people to struggle with knee-high boots on stairs, and it probably won't be an issue for you if you're over 5-foot-4 or so. But at 5-foot-2, I always fall victim to the back-of-the-knee issue. Otherwise, the heel height, pitch, and wide-calf fit, and option for a wide footbed make everything about the boot super comfortable when you're standing still or walking.\n\nThe Mila is the silhouette of the moment. I can't even tell you how many boots that look exactly like this I spotted on NYC's glitterati during fall fashion week. A pointed toe, a kitten heel, and a slouchy shaft have never been trendier — and the Mila combines them all. I got it in a luxurious black suede, but it's also available in olive, black, and silver leather.\n\nThese are a perfect middle ground between knee-high boots and ankle boots. They hit right at the calf muscle on me, which I was worried would be unflattering since I don't have mile-long legs like the model. But they look amazing with tights. And I can't wait to wear them peeking out from maxi skirts and paired with slim-fitting pants. The only thing I would avoid wearing them with is mini skirts with bare legs, since they tend to emphasize the widest part of my leg.\n\nAgain, I can't say enough good things about how comfortable these are. More than platforms or block heels, it takes a lot to make sure that kitten heels are comfortable and provide balance. And these pass the comfort test with flying colors. I would just caution anyone with particularly developed calf muscles that this may not work for them, since the shaft is a touch narrow.",

    "fullText": "On the first day of Christmas — also known as December 25 — partridge is not on the menu for Luigi Mangione. But another exotic bird is.\n\nIt's \"baked Cornish hen,\" described as the best meal of the year if you're in the federal prison system.\n\nIt's the holiday lunch special at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where Mangione is being held without bail for a second Christmas as he fights state and federal murder charges in the Manhattan ambush shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.\n\n\"It looks, honestly, like you see it in pictures,\" former MDC detainee Brad Rouse told Business Insider of the annual avian treat.\n\n\"They did put an effort in,\" said Rouse, who still remembers the detention center's once-a-year Cornish game hen almost two decades later. \"It's a well-cooked, delicious little item.\"\n\nThe bird will be served with cranberry sauce and sides of spinach or mac and cheese, according to a menu provided to Business Insider by jail officials.\n\nThis being a federal lockup, there will be little else that is festive about the meal.\n\nAs on any other day, the food will roll in from the kitchen without fanfare, transported inside a locked metal cart on wheels.\n\n\"The corrections officer watches it go down the hall and has the key to open it,\" Rouse remembered.\n\nThe meal will be served on the same plastic trays as every other meal — dished out to a line of detainees by other detainees wearing masks and food-service hats \"like cafeteria ladies,\" he joked.\n\nThere are no holiday place settings, and no forks or knives.\n\nThe small birds must be eaten the same way as all meals, by hand and with the help of a plastic spork — a combination spoon and fork designed to minimize the risk of detainees stabbing each other.\n\n\"I was surprised. I'd never had a Cornish hen before,\" Rouse told Business Insider.\n\n\"The effort they put into the meal was very touching,\" he added.\n\n\"It's dire and very tough to be in jail at Christmas,\" remembered Rouse, a Harvard graduate who was held at Brooklyn's MDC for a year on drug charges until his release in 2008.\n\n\"It's a time of high emotion. There are a lot of younger men with small children,\" said Rouse, who since 2018 has been a consultant with White Collar Advice. The firm helps detainees, inmates, and their families navigate the prison system.\n\n\"It can be a very melancholy day,\" he said.\n\nCarols will not be playing over the detention center's sound system during the Christmas meal, but that may come as a welcome break for Mangione, who was forced to listen to hours of holiday Muzak during a series of evidence-suppression hearings that concluded this week.\n\nThe same half-dozen songs, including \"Holly Jolly Christmas\" and \"Winter Wonderland,\" were blasted over and over inside the Manhattan courtroom — the soundtrack for police bodycam footage from Mangione's arrest at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, on December 9, 2024.\n\nThompson, 50, was shot from behind on a Midtown Manhattan sidewalk just before dawn on December 4, 2024, as he walked to the entrance of a Hilton hotel where he was set to give a speech at UnitedHealthcare's annual investor conference.\n\nThe Minnesota man is survived by his two sons and by his wife, who, in the days after Thompson's shooting, called him \"an incredibly loving father.\" Family members have not spoken publicly of the shooting since then.\n\nOn the last day of the evidence suppression hearing, held just this week, Mangione's New York prosecutor, Joel Seidemann, alluded to the family's continuing pain and need for closure. He asked a judge to set a trial date at Mangione's next scheduled court appearance on May 18.\n\n\"I just hope that the parties understand that it is very important to the family of the victim, the mother, who is 77 years old, to be able to know whether or not this is the person who shot her son,\" he said.\n\nNew York Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro said he expects to decide by May 18 on lead defense lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo's bid to suppress statements and evidence taken during the arrest.",

    "fullText": "Nike's grip on China's sneaker market is slipping.\n\nOnce a status symbol among Chinese consumers, analysts say it's increasingly losing cultural relevance even as its products remain innovative.\n\nThe sportswear giant's stock tumbled by 9% in early trading on Friday after reporting its Q2 fiscal results on Thursday.\n\nWhile sales in North America rose 9% to $5.63 billion during the quarter, sales in Greater China were down 17% to $1.42 billion — falling short of Wall Street's expectations.\n\nNike CEO Elliott Hill said on Thursday's earnings call, \"It's clear that we need to reset our approach to the China marketplace.\"\n\n\"We're acting decisively to accelerate the lagging areas, with China at the top of that list,\" he said.\n\nWhile retail watchers say Nike has made some progress in preparing for this reset by reducing promotions and improving inventory management, there's a deeper challenge at play.\n\nThe \"brand that is not connecting culturally in a way that rivals are,\" Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, warned in a note to clients on Thursday.\n\nSaunders said this is a \"more entrenched problem\" that is going to take some time to resolve.\n\nThe core problem is a \"systemic cultural lag,\" Linda Yu, general manager of consultancy firm Red Ant Asia, told Business Insider.\n\nNike \"needs to move beyond traditional sports marketing and genuinely understand and integrate into the cultural confidence, sense of community belonging, and lifestyle aspirations of China's younger generation,\" she added.\n\nChinese consumers, particularly Gen Z, are embracing the \"Guochao\" movement that celebrates Chinese heritage and homegrown brands.\n\nLocal brands such as Anta and Li-Ning have been capitalizing on this by creating culturally relevant campaigns, product designs, and digital experiences that resonate with younger consumers.\n\nNike's messaging, which still leans heavily on \"elite athleticism and individual grit\" — with slogans like its iconic \"Just Do It\" — feels distant by comparison, Jack Porteous, Commercial Director at China marketing & strategy agency TONG Global, told Business Insider.\n\nGeopolitical tensions between the US and China are also making it harder for Nike, encouraging consumers to favor domestic competitors.\n\n\"I think that Nike has failed to adapt to the cultural values of China's Gen-Z, \" he said, adding: \"Some netizens observe that while Nike's content is high quality, it feels less authentic and more brand-controlled — making it less accessible for a generation who crave personalisation and self-expression.\"\n\nRivals such as Lululemon and Adidas have seen growth in China as they've found ways to connect with shoppers there, Yu said.\n\nAdidas does it through local trend collaborations and Lululemon via its \"highly engaged value-based\" communities,\" she said.\n\nIt's not just through its messaging that it's losing consumers. Porteous said, Nike is also playing catch-up when it comes to digital engagement.\n\nIn China, shoppers often discover brands through apps and marketplaces such as WeChat, Douyin, and Tmall. Local rivals excel here with livestreaming, influencer collaborations, and interactive community campaigns.\n\nHowever, Nike's reliance on more traditional marketing channels means it is at a disadvantage in terms of visibility and relevance, especially among Gen Z shoppers.",

    "description": "Bank of America was among the first to flag a \"run-it-hot\" scenario for the US economy, defined by robust growth and above-target inflation.",
    "fullText": "The US economy will keep burning hot in 2026, extending a yearslong run of dodging a recession.\n\nThat's a view that is increasingly being woven into consensus forecasts on Wall Street, where top researchers have generally brushed off the risks of a near-term recession and are anticipating another year of stable economic growth and hot inflation.\n\nBank of America dubbed this the \"run-it-hot\" scenario for the US economy back in September, and others have since adopted the phrase.\n\nIn its year-ahead economic outlook, BofA said it believes growth will remain strong and inflation will stay above target next year, pointing to tailwinds such as the Fed's rate cuts, AI investment, more supportive trade policy, and stimulus in President Donald Trump's Big Beautiful Bill.\n\n\"Tariff cuts, tax cuts, rate cuts…'run-it-hot' US policy, implicit guarantee economy & stocks 'too big to fail,'\" a team of analysts led by Michael Hartnett wrote in a separate client note this fall.\n\nMorgan Stanley strategists also unveiled their \"run it hot\" investment thesis heading into 2026, pointing to the Fed's rate-cutting cycle and the central bank's recent announcement that it would begin reserve management purchases.\n\nGoldman Sachs said it also saw economic growth remaining robust in 2026, thanks to the Fed cutting rates in a non-recessionary macro environment.\n\n\"Despite stagnant job growth, we expect policy rate cuts to limit labour market weakness and help extend the economic cycle further,\" Goldman said, though it noted that valuations in the stock market are already \"hot.\"\n\nHere's how the forecasters think investors should position themselves in a \"run it hot\" market.\n\nCommodities are the top run-it-hot trade heading into next year, Bank of America strategists wrote in a note in December.\n\nOil and energy are also favorable investments under the run-it-hot regime, they added.\n\n\"Trump runs it hot, oil bounces post Russia-Ukraine fix, China keeps yuan cheap, soon all the commodity charts will look like gold,\" strategists wrote. \"We say long commodities the best 'run it hot' trade in '26, and long despised oil/energy without question the best 'run-it-hot' contrarian trade.\"\n\nCyclical assets — which, by definition, tend to do well when the economy is expanding — are likely to benefit from the macro picture next year, Goldman Sachs said.\n\nThe bank pointed to areas like housing and consumer-facing sides of the market, which include consumer discretionary and retail stocks.\n\n\"After a patch of worry in November, cyclical assets—including cyclical equities and copper—have been rallying again. But even after these recent moves, we think our more optimistic growth views are not fully reflected in markets,\" the bank wrote.\n\nMorgan Stanley thinks consumer discretionary goods investments fall into the \"run it hot\" investing playbook. The bank noted that firms generally have higher pricing power today, which should boost revenue growth.\n\nThat dynamic is already playing out in the discretionary goods sector, strategists said. The rate for top-line earnings beats in the sector for the third quarter clocked in at 6%, above the 2% rate for the overall S&P 500, per Morgan Stanley's analysis.\n\nSmall-cap stocks also look attractive, with earnings and pricing power in the sector poised to accelerate heading into next year, Morgan Stanley added.\n\n\"On the earnings front, the two most important aspects of our constructive call are the return of (1) positive operating leverage and (2) pricing power. This combination is especially impactful for the small cap earnings recovery we foresee into 2026,\" the bank's strategists added.\n\nForecasters at Bank of America and Goldman Sachs have also issued bullish calls on small-cap stocks heading into 2026, largely because valuations in the sector are more attractive than in areas such as mega-cap tech stocks.",

    "description": "As a chef, I have tips and tricks for making foods like roast chicken, potato salads, mayo, and cookies at home that everyone should know.",
    "fullText": "As a trained chef, I know that even the smallest tweak can make the largest difference on your final plate.\n\nHere are a few tips for preparing the foods everyone should know how to make:\n\nTurn a chicken into a one-pan meal by scattering chopped carrots, onions, potatoes, and any other hearty vegetables around the pan to roast with your bird.\n\nAs the meat cooks, it will release delicious juices, which those ingredients will then soak up. By the time your chicken is cooked through, you'll also have some of the most flavorful veggies to serve with it.\n\nTurn down the heat on your scrambled eggs and stir them as little as possible for the creamiest, most tender texture.\n\nInstead of jostling the mixture in the pan, gently pull the outer edges toward the center a few times as it cooks. And don't forget to remove your scramble from the skillet before it looks fully cooked — done in the pan is dry on the plate.\n\nWith a box of puff pastry in your freezer, you'll be able to whip up an impressive appetizer, dinner, or dessert with minimal effort.\n\nYou can make a one-crust chicken pot pie (no one will miss the soggy bottom, I promise), elegant twisted cheese sticks, or a stunning tarte tatin (a dessert baked with caramelized fruit) with just a few extra ingredients.\n\nTo achieve the thickest, chewiest cookies, chill the raw dough mounds in the fridge or freezer before baking.\n\nThis tip is particularly relevant to doughs containing butter or oil — the cold will solidify those ingredients a bit, so the cookies don't spread as much in the oven.\n\nSlide a thin slice of apple or pear between the bread and cheese for an easy and gourmet way to upgrade your next grilled cheese.\n\nThe fruit releases sugars that infuse the sandwich with a subtle sweetness — the perfect complement to umami-rich cheese.\n\nTo upgrade your dessert game, make a simple custard with egg yolks, sugar, cream, and vanilla (or your other favorite flavorings).\n\nAfter churning and freezing, the result will be infinitely creamier, with a richer flavor that blows the store-bought stuff out of the water.\n\nDiscover the wonderful world of homemade mayonnaise with the help of a food processor or immersion blender.\n\nUsing one of those appliances, whip a high-quality neutral oil with egg yolks, salt, and a bit of Dijon mustard to make a mayo that can elevate your next sandwich, potato salad, or dressing.\n\nWhether you're making crispy fries or fluffy mashed potatoes, soak your spuds after peeling or slicing them.\n\nPotatoes oxidize quickly, so their white flesh will start to turn brown soon after it's exposed to the air — but plunging them into a water bath helps prevent this from happening.\n\nMake the most soul-warming chicken-noodle soup by cooking a whole bird in a pot of simmering water. This turns the mix into a broth while cooking the meat simultaneously.\n\nThen remove the chicken, add veggies like carrots and celery, and shred the meat. Stir everything together at the end with noodles for a delectable homemade soup.\n\nAdd a sprinkle of flaky salt to cookies, brownies, cakes, and pies when they're still warm and fresh out of the oven.\n\nSalt naturally enhances flavors, including sweet ones. Plus, the flakes can add a nice textural component to your soft baked goods.\n\nThis story was originally published in September 2021 and most recently updated on December 19, 2025.",

    "fullText": "Holiday baking is a fun activity in the lead-up to Christmas or any other holiday you celebrate, but you don't have to spend a lot of money or make complicated, intricate desserts to enjoy a sweet treat around the holidays.\n\nFrom peanut-butter balls and rich chocolate fudge to peppermint bark, these festive desserts only require a few ingredients to make, and you might already have all of the ingredients lying around.\n\nHere are 10 festive holiday desserts that only need five ingredients or fewer.\n\nThese three-ingredient sugar cookies by BellyFull take 15 minutes to whip up and use things that you probably already have in your kitchen: unsalted butter, granulated sugar, and all-purpose flour.\n\nHowever, if you want to make your sugar cookies even more special, you can also use a few extra ingredients, such as vanilla, a quick and easy icing like this one from Betty Crocker, and festive red, green, or blue sprinkles.\n\nThis recipe by SweetPhi utilizes baking soda, sugar, light corn syrup, dry-roasted peanuts, and flaky sea salt to create a rich holiday treat. You won't even need a candy thermometer to make this dessert — just a saucepan, measuring spoons, and parchment paper.\n\nTo make sweet-and-spicy chocolate bark, you'll need hazelnuts, two bars of dark chocolate, dried cranberries, sea salt, and cayenne pepper.\n\nOne of the best parts about making chocolate bark is that not only can you customize the toppings, but you also don't even need to bake it. Melt the chocolate, add your toppings, and refrigerate until it is hardened and ready to break apart.\n\nIf you enjoy peppermint mochas, you'll love this four-ingredient dessert. To make white-chocolate peppermint bark, you'll need candy canes or hard peppermint candies, dark chocolate, white chocolate, and peppermint extract.\n\nIt's perfect for making with kids and keeps for up to three weeks in the refrigerator, meaning you can enjoy it throughout the entire holiday season.\n\nThe Stay at Home Chef's recipe for five-ingredient peanut-butter cookies is gluten-free and includes creamy peanut butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, one egg, and vanilla extract.\n\nWhether you're a peanut-butter fanatic or simply an inexperienced baker, this easy recipe by Kitchen Fun calls for four ingredients that you might already have in your pantry: creamy peanut butter, powdered sugar, butter, and semi-sweet chocolate chips.\n\nMake the peanut-butter dough, dip the balls into the melted chocolate, and refrigerate them until the chocolate has hardened. If you want to go the extra mile, you can also top the balls with festive-colored sprinkles or nuts for added flavor and texture.\n\nGimme Some Oven's recipe for five-ingredient whiskey dark chocolate truffles uses dark chocolate, heavy cream, butter, sea salt, and your choice of whiskey.\n\nBe warned: These sweet treats aren't intended for kids. Since the truffles aren't baked, none of the alcohol gets a chance to \"burn off.\"\n\nTo make Gimme Some Oven's lemon bars, you'll need all-purpose flour, butter, powdered sugar, eggs, and lemons. Or, if you're looking to make life even easier, you can buy store-bought lemon curd.\n\nDip your strawberries into melted semisweet chocolate, then set them down onto a sheet pan lined with parchment paper, and wait until the chocolate has set.\n\nTo make your chocolate-covered strawberries even more show-stopping, you can also melt some white chocolate and drizzle it over the top of the strawberries before setting them aside to harden.\n\nTaste of Home's recipe for five-ingredient chocolate fudge relies on pantry staples: butter, semisweet chocolate chips, milk chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk, and vanilla extract.\n\nIt only takes 10 minutes to prepare, meaning you can have a sweet treat ready to serve in no time, faster than you can say \"mistletoe.\"",

    "description": "Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan's philanthropy organization did not fund FWD.us in 2025. Zuckerberg cofounded the immigration reform group in 2013.",
    "fullText": "The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is no longer funding a pro-immigration group that Mark Zuckerberg cofounded over a decade ago.\n\nIt's the latest change for the organization amid the Meta CEO's public rightward shift since President Donald Trump was reelected.\n\nCZI, the philanthropic organization founded by Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, did not provide funding for the pro-immigration and criminal justice reform group FWD.us in 2025, according to two people familiar with the matter. It was the first year CZI did not fund FWD.us.\n\nThe shift had been in motion for years, beginning in late 2022, when CZI started pivoting its focus more squarely toward scientific research, the two people said. Discussions at the time indicated that the organization's financial relationship with FWD.us would eventually conclude, and the separation was formalized in April 2025, the people said. Bloomberg first reported the funding cut.\n\n\"Nearly five years ago, we shared that we were focusing on our core work in science, education, and supporting our local communities,\" a CZI representative told Business Insider in a statement. \"As part of that transition, we committed foundational funding to FWD.us to continue their bipartisan work. We have fulfilled that financial commitment and wound down our social advocacy funding.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Jordan Fox, CZI's chief of staff, also stepped down from FWD.us's board of directors, leaving a vacancy that will not be filled by another CZI representative, the two people added.\n\n\"Our focus remains on advancing pragmatic, bipartisan solutions that strengthen the economy and make the immigration and criminal justice systems work better,\" said Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us. \"That mission hasn't changed.\"\n\nZuckerberg was key to building FWD.us. He cofounded the organization in 2013, launching it via an op-ed in The Washington Post.\n\nFWD.us was backed by other tech leaders, including LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Dropbox cofounder Drew Houston, and VC and \"All In\" cohost Chamath Palihapitiya.\n\nIn 2024, Mark Zuckerberg met with Trump advisor Stephen Miller, who reportedly raised questions about CZI's ties to FWD.us, one person familiar with the matter said.\n\nZuckerberg has met and dined with Trump multiple times since his reelection and Meta contributed $1 million toward his inaugural fund, as well as helping fund the White House's new ballroom.\n\nAnd in a move widely viewed as an effort to curry favor with the Trump administration, Zuckerberg reversed course earlier this year on some Facebook and Instagram policy initiatives that had been previously criticized by conservatives. In January, Meta replaced its third-party fact-checkers with community notes and loosened its definition of hate speech. And in September, the CEO pledged a $600 billion US investment from Meta.\n\nIn November, Zuckerberg and Chan announced that they would shift CZI's focus to science and AI. The philanthropy now focuses on Biohub, a group of biology labs it has supported since 2016.\n\nCZI's recruiting pitch? They've got GPUs, Chan said in July. Zuckerberg later said that CZI researchers don't want more employees or office space; they want more GPUs.",

    "description": "As a frequent traveler, I've been to many countries, but the one city I'd pick to live in is Chiang Mai, Thailand. It feels perfect for a few reasons.",
    "fullText": "I've spent years filling up my passport with stamps from all around the world, from Australia to Latin America to Asia.\n\nI was even the first in my family to travel internationally — the only vacations we'd been on were road trips in our home country, Germany.\n\nSoon, I felt I needed a break from constantly being on the go. When deciding where to set up my home base, only one city came to mind: Chiang Mai, Thailand.\n\nOne of the most culturally significant cities in Thailand, Chiang Mai is located in the northern Thai mountain region, a few hundred miles north of Bangkok.\n\nThe city and its surrounding metropolitan area have a population of about 1 million people, and it's well known for its hundreds of beautiful Buddhist temples and temple ruins.\n\nI'd been to Chiang Mai a few times before I began to make it my home base.\n\nMy first visit was about a decade ago, when the city felt more like a backpacker's paradise with cheap beer on every corner, $5 hostel beds, and loads of young people driving around with their gear on rented scooters.\n\nToday, it's a major hub in Thailand, yet it still manages to maintain its local charm and wonderful balance between traditional and modern life.\n\nI love that I can find modern shopping malls alongside local, small \"mama shops\" owned by local families. There are big chains like Starbucks in the area, as well as numerous local tea stalls and fresh food markets.\n\nIt's not hard to dance at a modern nightclub one night and enjoy traditional Thai performances inside a temple the next.\n\nFrom a cultural perspective, I never get bored with visiting the hundreds of local Buddhist temples, attending both traditional and contemporary musical performances, or exploring dozens of modern Thai art galleries and exhibits.\n\nThough I've enjoyed having a home base, I still love to travel. I've found it easy to go on incredible day trips from this city year-round by car and by boat.\n\nIf I drive about 25 minutes from the city, I can reach the middle of an amazing national park. An hourlong drive gets me to the historic nearby town of Lamphun.\n\nI've also already visited the islands of Koh Chang, Koh Lanta, and Koh Samui, and explored smaller scenic towns like Kanchanaburi and Ayutthaya along the way.\n\nWhen I first moved here, I lived in a pet-friendly house with a garden in a gated community that offered a pool, tennis court, and other amenities.\n\nMy place was located about 25 minutes out of the old town, and the rent was a few hundred dollars a month — well within my modest budget.\n\nAlthough my neighborhood felt quiet, it was still convenient, with car-repair joints, fresh food markets, and numerous shops nearby.\n\nBuilding a community and making friends in the area has also been easy for me.\n\nI've met tons of people by just attending events I've seen advertised on Facebook and connecting with other remote workers and digital nomads.\n\nIt feels like there are local activities and gatherings for everyone, from yoga classes at various studios to meetups for tarot readers or drummers of all skill levels.\n\nAs a location-independent entrepreneur, it's also important to me to stay up-to-date on all things tech and business development.\n\nFortunately, I've found lots of conferences, meetups, and workshops related to industries I'm passionate about in my area — many hosted by my favorite coworking space, Alt_ Chiang Mai.\n\nI've also enjoyed visiting Free Bird Café for regular women's lunches, open mic nights, and other events. Plus, Chiang Mai hosts a recurring TEDx conference on topics related to AI, technology, culture, and sustainability.\n\nThere's no such thing as a perfect place, and if I had to think of one drawback of living here, it'd be Southeast Asia's annual burning season.\n\nThroughout this weekslong period, crop fields and forest debris are burned, contributing to horrible air quality and posing other risks to locals.\n\nThese annual events make it difficult for me to stay in Chiang Mai all year because I have pre-existing health issues.\n\nDuring the last few burning seasons, I've been fortunate to be able to rent a car and go on extended road trips with my dog to seek out fresher air and explore other beautiful places.\n\nEven so, whenever I leave for other travels, I find myself missing Chiang Mai. In my books, it has almost everything I could want and need.\n\nFalling in love with this city was easy for me, and it was wonderful having a home base there for several years. Though I've still got a few logistics to work out, I hope to call this piece of Thailand my permanent place of residence in the future.",

    "description": "TikTok has reached a deal to sell parts of its US business. Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX are part of the consortium of new investors.",
    "fullText": "Who's grabbing control of TikTok's US assets?\n\nOn Thursday, TikTok told staffers it had signed a deal to form a joint venture for its US business with a group of investors, according to an internal memo sent by CEO Shou Chew, which was viewed by Business Insider. The company expects the deal to close in late January, per the memo.\n\nThree managing investors will each hold a 15% stake in the new venture: Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX.\n\nFive percent of the US company will go to an unnamed group of new investors, while ByteDance, TikTok's owner, will maintain a 19.9% minority stake — the maximum allowed by the divest-or-ban law that spurred TikTok's sale. The remaining 30.1% will be controlled by an undisclosed group of existing ByteDance investors, according to the memo.\n\nIn September, President Donald Trump said Larry Ellison and his company, Oracle, would be involved in a $14 billion deal to buy TikTok's US business. At the time, Trump mentioned billionaires Rupert Murdoch and Michael Dell would also play a role, but it is unclear if they are involved in the current deal.\n\nOracle, which currently works with TikTok on data security, is expected to continue to be its \"trusted security partner\" tasked with safeguarding \"sensitive US user data,\" Chew wrote in his memo to staffers.\n\nTikTok's new US owners will retrain the content recommendation algorithm on US user data \"to ensure the content feed is free from outside manipulation,\" per the memo.\n\nTikTok did not respond to requests for comment. The White House referred Business Insider to TikTok. A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, when asked about the deal, referred press to \"competent authorities for anything specific,\" noting that \"China's position on TikTok is consistent and clear.\"\n\nHere are the key players in TikTok's US business going forward:\n\nSoftware giant Oracle will take a 15% stake in TikTok's US joint venture, according to the memo viewed by Business Insider.\n\nPrior to the recent deal, Oracle was already working closely with TikTok's US Data Security division (USDS). Oracle has stored US TikTok users' data for years as a safeguard for potential data leaks.\n\nLarry Ellison, who is also a financial participant in a bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery's business, is the chairman and cofounder of Oracle and a longtime Trump ally.\n\nMGX is a state-owned investment firm in Abu Dhabi.\n\nAccording to the internal memo, it will also take a 15% stake in the new TikTok entity as one of three managing investors.\n\nSheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a member of Abu Dhabi's royal ruling family, is the firm's chairman. The fund participated in OpenAI's $6.6 billion investment round in 2024.\n\nMGX did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSilver Lake is a tech-focused private equity firm.\n\nThe firm will take a 15% stake in the new TikTok entity, per the internal memo.\n\nIts current investments include Klarna, Carta, Dell Technologies, Genies, and Waymo, per the firm's website. Previous investments include Airbnb, Twitter, and Tesla.\n\nEgon Durban and Greg Mondre both act as co-CEO and managing partner at the private equity firm.\n\nSilver Lake declined to comment.\n\nAccording to the memo, \"affiliates of certain existing investors\" in ByteDance will hold a combined 30.1% of the new entity.\n\nPrivate equity giant KKR and venture capital firms, such as Sequoia Capital and SoftBank, have previously invested in ByteDance. It's not yet clear which of these investors will retain shares in the new US entity.\n\nSequoia Capital did not respond to a request for comment. KKR and SoftBank declined to comment.\n\nWhile 95% of ownership in the new TikTok US joint venture will fall under Oracle, Silver Lake, MGX, ByteDance, and its earlier investors, the remaining 5% stake will pass to an unnamed group of \"new investors,\" per TikTok's memo.\n\nTrump previously said that billionaires Michael Dell and Rupert Murdoch may be involved in the TikTok deal, so it's possible that they could fall within this mystery investor set.",

Make sure every change it makes is double-checked—with automatic checks, simple tests that confirm things still work, and at least one human review.

    "title": "These Bone Conduction Headphones Are My Tech 'Upgrade of the Year'",
    "description": "I've burned through a record number of audiobooks with these babies.",
    "fullText": "Bone conduction headphones (BCHs) have been around for a while, but I didn't really start using them until this year, and they've honestly changed everything for me. They have helped keep my mind occupied—usually with an audiobook—while I tackle mundane tasks while leaving me able to communicate with my wife without constantly taking my earbuds out. As I result, I've listened to more books than ever this year, but beyomnd that accomplishment, I love that I'm able to remain aware of my surroundings while listening to my music, podcast, shows, calls, or, yes, my audiobook. That's why BCHs are my tech upgrade of 2025.\n\nEarlier this year, I reviewed the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2, and I'm glad I did. I'd tested other BCHs previously, but the OpenRun Pro 2 were on a different level entirely. They employ a hybrid of BCH technology and open-air sound that projects low frequencies to your ears. This means they sound almost like regular headphones, while keeping the benefits of BCH. (they don't cover your ears, so you're more tuned in to the world around you).\n\nI used to use regular earbuds while taking work calls or doing household chores, and I would often find myself only using one earbud so I wouldn't be totally tuned out to my surroundings. Yes, most earbuds now have a transparency mode of some sort, but I'd usually find it easier to just take one out rather than remembering how to toggle it on or off. The downside here is that I'd typically leave whichever earbud I'd removed lying somewhere around the house, or lose it outright. Moreover, if I was listening to something in stereo, I'd be missing out on half of the experience. That all changed when I started using the OpenRun Pro 2 as my go-to headphones.\n\nUnlike earbuds or over-ear headphone, which can be fatiguing after extended use, the OpenRun Pro 2 are so comfortable, I sometimes forget I'm wearing them. Their microphones are great, so I can use them to take calls or virtual meetings without issue. Because of their hybrid audio model, I don't experience the sensation of vibration that tickled my ears when I tried other BCH models. I love that I can have a full conversation with my wife while washing the dishes or cooking and not have to worry about pausing my media or fumbling with my earbuds. And the best part is that they're waterproof, so I can go from a runs and straight to the shower without missing a beat—or, more often, a chapter of my current book (you'd be surprised how many minutes of extra listening you can rack up over the course of a year of showers, not to mention washing dishes, walking the dog, and other everyday tasks). With the help of these headphones, I look forward to beating my audiobook record again in 2026.",

    "description": "Load up websites and video on your dashboard—but you have to be parked, first.",
    "fullText": "You can do a lot with Android Auto, but what you can't do is install a web browser—at least not with the default, out-of-the-box configuration. It is actually possible to get a window on to the web with a little bit of tweaking, and the help of the open source AA Browser built especially for Android Auto.\n\nGetting a web browser up on your car dashboard may not seem like much of an improvement over browsing on your phone screen, but it also enables another feature on your vehicle's display: video playback. Through AA Browser you can get at pretty much any streaming site you want and load up some video.\n\nSome serious safety warnings are required here, though. You should only load up videos on your car's Android Auto screen when you're parked, stationary, and not going anywhere. Watching anything on the move—whether it's on your phone or on your vehicle dashboard—not only risks your life, it risks the lives of everyone else on the road with you.\n\nIn fact, AA Browser will disable itself while your vehicle is moving, but it's worth giving out the warning in any case, for this and any other app. With that out of the way, here's how you can load up a web browser on Android Auto, and make your parked-up time inside your car more entertaining.\n\nLike Android as a whole, Android Auto has a developer mode that gives you access to a selection of extra settings. From Settings on Android, tap Connected devices > Connection preferences > Android Auto (Pixels) or just Connected devices > Android Auto (Galaxy phones). Scroll down to the bottom of the screen, tap Version, then tap Version and permission info seven times.\n\nYou should then see a pop-up asking you if you're sure you want to enable developer settings for Android Auto, so tap OK to confirm. You then need to open up the AAAD (Android Auto Apps Downloader) app APK in your phone's browser, tapping through the security warnings about running non-Play Store apps on your device if they show up.\n\nAAAD gives you access to a selection of Android Auto apps that haven't been specifically approved by Google, including AA Browser. Tap through the various introduction screens, give the app the permissions that it needs to install other apps, and then find AA Browser in the list of available apps. Tap Install and then tap through the confirmation pop-ups to get the app on your phone.\n\nYou'll be asked if you want to open AA Browser straight away: You can use it as a normal web browser on your phone, though there's not really much to look at. It's designed to be used primarily on your Android Auto screen, and it should now show up as an available app when your phone is connected to your vehicle.\n\nProvided you're safely stopped in your vehicle, you can launch AA Browser from the main apps list on the Android Auto interface (you may also get a prompt to launch it the first time you connect, after installing the app). You get taken to the Google Search homepage to begin with, and from there you can go anywhere you like.\n\nAs with any other Android Auto app, if you tap inside an input field, you'll see a keyboard pop up on screen that you can use to enter web addresses and login credentials, and you can use the touchscreen to navigate around. To get to the URL address bar, tap anywhere on screen, then tap the blue arrow in the lower left corner.\n\nThe next screen also gives you options for going back through your browser history and accessing your bookmarks—a handy way of making sure you can jump back to the sites you need without having to tap our their URLs every time. There's also the option to request the desktop versions of sites rather than the mobile versions.\n\nWhile certain sites don't seem to like the AA Browser, most of the pages I've visited work fine on Android Auto. To quit the browser, you can either tap the Exit button in the top right corner (if it's visible), or swipe up or down from the top or bottom edges of the Android Auto screen to go back to your other apps.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Apple Watch User Should Know",
    "description": "The Apple Watch isn't just about notifications and workouts.",
    "fullText": "The Apple Watch is both a companion to the iPhone, as well as a very capable device in its own right. Out of the box, it offers notification mirroring, so you feel every alert on your iPhone on your wrist, as well as workout tracking, so you can keep up with your fitness goals. But this wearable can be so much more than that. In fact, it doesn't take much to make your Apple Watch more personal and efficient. If you own one, here are ten hacks you need to know about:\n\nGet your notifications under control. By default, Apple likes to forward every single alert from iPhone to your watch. That’s just a recipe for distraction. You should turn off most of these alerts, and only keep the most important notifications. An important message from Slack or a text from a close friend is worth the distraction; a promotion from Uber is not. Open the Watch app on your iPhone, go to Notifications, scroll down and disable most of the apps that mirror alerts from the iPhone.\n\nWhile you’re at it, it might help to keep your Watch in Silent mode at all times. Open the Control Center by pressing the Side button and tap the Bell icon to quiet your watch for good.\n\nThe Apple Watch's recent wrist gestures have turned out to be a sleeper hit for me. What I thought would be a gimmick is something I use multiple times a day now. If you have an Apple Watch Series 9, Ultra 2, SE 3, or higher, you get access to two gestures: Double Tap and Wrist Flick. First, if you tap your index finger and your thumb twice in the air, you’ll perform the major action current on-screen. This could include answering a call, stopping a timer, or stopping a workout. I use this all the time now, even when I don’t have my hands full. Second, you can flick your wrist up to go back a screen on your watch. This is a simple way to get back from menus, or to go back to the watch face, without actually tapping the screen.\n\nThis is a feature I've been using for years, but since it's buried quite deep in settings, many users don't know about it. Once set up, you can unlock your Mac automatically as long as you’re wearing your Apple Watch. It doesn’t even have to be on the same wifi network, so this works when you’re out and about.\n\nTo set this up, go to System Settings on your Mac, then choose Touch ID & Password. In the Apple Watch section, simply turn on the sync feature for your Apple Watch. Once you authenticate with your Mac password, you’ll be good to go. The next time you lift the lid on your Mac, macOS will automatically sign you in.\n\nI used to love customizing my watch face with all the various complications for timers, shortcuts, and, weather, just to name a few. But I was never really satisfied with how cluttered things looked when it was all set up. That changed once I embraced the Photos watch face, and moved all the contextual information and shortcuts to widgets. Keeping all those functions and data points in a collapsable stack of widgets, rather than all on screen at once, looks so much better.\n\nTo try this out for yourself, scroll using the Crown or swipe up on the watch face to access your widgets. Go to the bottom and tap the Edit button to start customizing your widget stack. You can add three app shortcuts to the top widget. I usually save this for workouts, battery, and the quick timer. Then, I have dedicated widgets for my Activity Rings, Weather, Shortcuts, Sleep, and more. You can pin widgets in the order that you want, and watchOS will also automatically suggest relevant widgets depending on your usage. Dive in deeper with our detailed guide on customizing widgets.\n\nOnce you move your app interactions to widgets, your watch faces suddenly open up. Take some time to create and customize two to three watch faces that you can switch between as you wish. It's easy to do at any time: just swipe in from the left or the right edge to change the watch face.\n\nCreating and customizing watch faces is actually easier on the Watch app on the iPhone. In fact, it’s the only place where you can set up my favorite watch face: the Photos watch face. This watch face cycles between the photos of my wife, nature, and urban landscapes, showing me a fresh selection each day. I love this watch face quite a lot. You can also create a watch face for fitness tracking and fitness modes, and a simple watch face for regular use. (My favorites here are Typograph and Meridian watch faces.)\n\nFor almost a decade, you couldn’t edit your Activity Rings. If you got sick, or just wanted to take an easy day, you’d lose your fitness streak. This, of course, isn’t the healthiest approach to fitness—for that, you should check out the Gentler Streak app. However, since last year's watchOS 11, you’ve had the option to pause or change your Activity Rings. You can do this from the Fitness app on iPhone, which is slightly easier than using the Apple Watch itself. From the Fitness app, tap Activity Rings, then scroll down, where you'll see Change Goals and Pause Rings. Choose the relevant option to get started. I have detailed instructions in my guide as well.\n\nIf you use an Apple TV, you know how easy it is to lose the remote. You might be familiar with the Apple TV’s remote control feature on the iPhone, but that same feature exists on the Apple Watch as well. You’ll have to find the Remote app from the app list, then choose your Apple TV. It should appear as long as it's on the same network as your watch, and nearby. From here, you can use swipe gestures and buttons to control playback on your TV.\n\nOn the Apple Watch, silent mode and alarm sound levels are married to each other, unlike on the iPhone. But recently, Apple added a feature where you can break-through silent mode for a particular alarm—it's just not enabled by default for all alarms. To set it up, open an alarm from the Alarms app, go to the Edit Alarm menu, scroll down, and enable Break Through Silent Mode.\n\nFocuses on the iPhone are supremely powerful, and underrated. And things get a lot more interesting when you add Apple Watch to the mix. Each Focus can have its own watch face associated with it, so you can have a different watch face for your work Focus, another one for your personal Focus, and a fitness watch face for your workout Focus. Go to Settings > Focus to customize or create any Focus.\n\nYour Apple Watch comes with a built-in sleep tracker. To use it, you can either go to the Sleep app on Apple Watch, and create a sleep schedule, or simply switch to the Sleep Focus. When you’re in sleep mode, your watch automatically goes dark and silent, so you won't be bothered by any notifications.\n\nWith watchOS 26, your Apple Watch now also gives you a sleep score, which offers more insights into your sleeping habits. I’ve been using the Sleep mode this past year with my Apple Watch Series 10, and I’ve gotten a lot out of the sleep tracking feature already.",

    "description": "If Edinburgh turn over high-flying Glasgow Warriors at Hampden on Saturday, it would be a shock on the scale of St Mirren's cup final win against Celtic.",
    "fullText": "URC: Glasgow Warriors v Edinburgh\n\nVenue: Hampden Park, Glasgow Date: Saturday, 20 December Time: 15:00 GMT\n\nCoverage: Live text on BBC Sport website & app\n\nIt's less than a week since Hampden Park witnessed its last shock when St Mirren beat Celtic in the Premier Sports Cup final. If Edinburgh turn over high-flying Glasgow Warriors at the national stadium on Saturday, it would be similarly surprising.\n\nWarriors are riding high after a thrilling and stunning victory over six-time European champions Toulouse in the Champions Cup, rising from the ashes of a 21-0 deficit to deliver a win that sent reverberations around Europe.\n\nEdinburgh, by contrast, are reeling from a 33-0 thrashing at the hands of Castres. A seismic win at home to French heavyweights Toulon the week before confirmed what we already know: that at their best Edinburgh can be a match for anyone. But they remain consistently, and maddeningly, inconsistent.\n\nThe tale of recent 1872 Cup meetings has been victory for the home side. Since adopting a two-leg format in 2021, seven of the past eight matches between Glasgow and Edinburgh have resulted in home victories. Edinburgh have not delivered an 1872 Cup victory along the M8 since 2020.\n\nWarriors have won the trophy in the past three consecutive seasons, but in the most recent two they have had the bittersweet feeling of lifting the trophy having been turned over in the second leg at Murrayfield.\n\n\"It's been difficult for us over the last couple of years because we've gone through this cycle of hammering Edinburgh in the first game, we're all over them, and then the second game we lose,\" Warriors' Ollie Smith told BBC Scotland.\n\n\"We still retain the 1872 Cup, but I think it just shows the kind of standards that we set ourselves at the start of the season to be like, we're not just happy to retain the 1872 Cup, we want to win both games.\n\n\"It's getting our emotions right in those massive occasions and putting a performance that we know we can be proud of.\n\n\"If they beat us then they have to beat us by being perfect because, and there's no disrespect to Edinburgh, but it feels like we've almost let them win because we've not been at it. But this year, the focus is for us to be spot on and make them beat us rather than giving it to them.\"\n\nCummings eyes silverware as he signs new Glasgow deal\n\nHow loss of brother shaped Smith's rugby journey\n\nEdinburgh's memories of their first visit to Hampden last season are ones they would rather forget. They were obliterated by Glasgow, falling 33-0 down before grabbing a couple of late consolation tries to take a slight edge off the embarrassing scoreline.\n\nSean Everitt's side are specialists at bouncing back from bad defeats, mainly because they have had so much practice at it. Edinburgh fans would love if, for once, their team were not made to suffer before producing a reaction, but rather came out at Hampden on the front foot.\n\nOne of the capital side's breakout stars this season, back-row Liam McConnell, believes that in Glasgow his team face not only their local rivals, but one of the best sides around. It is among the reasons he is relishing the tussle between the sides.\n\n\"I've never played in one,\" said the 21-year-old. \"I've been at the club for the last couple of seasons now and been around it when it's the 1872 Cup weeks. It's always special.\n\n\"The guys in the matchday squad have a different intensity around them, so to be part of it is pretty cool. Everyone's real focused for Saturday, you can tell.\n\n\"It'll be good. Glasgow are in good form right now, probably one of the best club teams in the world, you could say.\n\n\"It's not only 1872, we're playing one of the best club teams in the world at the moment, so that's a challenge in itself. I'm really excited.\"\n\nAll the feelgood factor and momentum generated from that famous win over Toulon was dynamited by Edinburgh fielding a weakened team and going down meekly to Castres.\n\nIt's a familiar narrative heading into the derby – Glasgow being showered with praise, Edinburgh being bombarded with questions and criticism.\n\nThe best way to change that would be to give Warriors a bloody nose in front of their own people on Saturday.\n\n\"There's no-one better to beat, is there?\" said Edinburgh hooker Ewan Ashman.\n\n\"We know they're a quality team and those are the games you want to play. Glasgow are a good side and that was a good win [against Toulouse].\n\n\"We've done similar a couple of weeks ago against Toulon, so we know the feeling. They'll be riding super high and they'll be coming in with confidence.\n\n\"It's the exact kind of challenge we're looking to take head-on. We need to show that fighting spirit.\"",

    "fullText": "I wrote earlier this week about the important security updates Apple just rolled out in its 26.2 operating system updates. Among the security fixes are two zero-day bugs affecting WebKit, the browser engine that drives Safari. According to Apple, “this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26.”\n\nPretty serious. There are also many other security fixes, including (as I mentioned) a major Messages privacy leak. When a serious security update comes out, users should update. It’s just the smart move.\n\nApple generally tries not to leave behind users who haven’t updated or can’t update to the latest OS version. Apple also usually offers security updates for past OS versions, and indeed, the company also released iOS 18.7.3 to address the same issues.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s an ugly catch: Numerous iPhone users have reported that if your iPhone is capable of running iOS 26 but you’re still back on iOS 18, you won’t be offered iOS 18.7.3. Instead, the only update option you’ll be given is iOS 26.2.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons to avoid updating to iOS 26, from a dislike of Liquid Glass to software compatibility to a general wariness to install major updates for a while. This move effectively forces users to take the iOS 26 upgrade if they want the security updates. (iPhones not capable of running iOS 26 are offered the 18.7.3 update. iPads seem to be unaffected.)\n\nThis isn’t great. Apple shouldn’t be withholding a security update from people not willing to upgrade to the next OS version. I don’t know if this is an error, bug, or policy decision, and as of this writing, Apple hasn’t responded to my questions about this issue.\n\nSeveral users have reported to me that a workaround is to 7.3. Seems like a long way to go just to get security fixes.\n\nIn general, Apple is very good about supplying security updates to older operating systems, so all its users can stay protected. But in cases like this, users should never be forced to choose between ignoring a security update and updating to an OS version they’re not ready for.\n\nIf you appreciate articles like this one, support us by becoming a Six Colors subscriber.

You don't become a bad coach in four months.\n\n\"You are working tirelessly and you are fully committed. It's what you I am an emotional person and I wear my heart in my sleeve.\n\n\"To get the team to this position in the Premier League and see it change so quickly is hurtful. I will never be in doubt, you can chuck anything at me and I will keep bouncing back to try and improve this group.\"",

    "fullText": "Sport gave Scott Meenagh a reason to get out of his bed in the morning. Now the 36-year-old is preparing for his third and final Winter Paralympics and targeting a medal.\n\nHis life changed forever when he was injured serving with the Parachute Regiment in Afghanistan in 2011. He lost both legs after stepping on an improvised explosive device in Helmand Province, an incident in which one of his closest friends lost his life.\n\nA rugby player before the accident, Meenagh became a rower during rehabilitation before switching to biathlon, the gruelling combination of cross-country skiing and shooting.\n\nNext year's games in Milan-Cortina mark the 50th anniversary of the first Winter Paralympics and will run 6-15 March.\n\n\"I needed a purpose,\" Meenagh said. \"I needed something that was going to kick me back into track and life again. And what sport presents you is an opportunity to be a better version of yourself every day.\n\n\"I feel that's a real position I'm in at the moment. I'm not just given the opportunity to be a better version of myself. I'm expected to be better every day, that's something that keeps me going.\n\n\"I've gone through some real difficult times in my life. I've suffered a lot of trauma and I also lost a really close friend of mine in Afghanistan. The perspective that gives you, that appetite for life is really strong. And, when you've probably been at the bottom, you try to make the very most of every day.\n\n\"The first bite of high-performance sport was taking part in the first-ever Invictus Games in 2014 as a rower. I was able to pull on that Great Britain tracksuit and compete on an international stage in front of my friends and family.\n\n\"It was a real milestone in my recovery journey, but also it really gave me the bug for that next level. That's when I decided to really commit my life to sport.\"",

Scorchers are third in the table, with Heat fifth, because of their superior net run-rate.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "When the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations kicks off on Sunday, hosts Morocco are hoping it leads to the culmination of an ambitious long-term plan to become the continent's leading football nation.\n\nSince last lifting the Afcon trophy in Ethiopia in 1976, the Atlas Lions have rarely come close to repeating the feat. It is a lengthy wait which contrasts sharply with recent achievements elsewhere.\n\n\"Every time I put [on] the Moroccan jersey, it's like an amazing feeling,\" midfielder Sofyan Amrabat told the BBC World Service.\n\nThe former Manchester United player was a key part of the Morocco side who reached the semi-finals of the last Fifa World Cup in Qatar - the first African nation to go that deep at the tournament.\n\n\"It's difficult to explain. It's something you feel inside in your heart,\" the 29-year-old said about representing his country.\n\n\"I'm really looking forward to this Afcon, especially because it's at home. And of course, we hope it's going to be ours.\"\n\nFor Moroccan football analyst Jalal Bounouar, the expectations are clear.\n\n\"Morocco's primary and most immediate goal is to win Afcon,\" he told BBC Sport Africa.\n\n\"Winning the continental title is seen as the final piece of the puzzle.\"\n\nThe semi-final defeat by France at Qatar 2022 was followed by the men's under-23s winning bronze at the Paris 2024 Olympics, while the under-20s are world champions after defeating Argentina in October's final.\n\nMorocco have also won the last three African Nations Championships - an international tournament for players based only in domestic leagues - in which they have participated (2018, 2020 and 2024). This week, that side also clinched victory in the Fifa Arab Cup final against Jordan.\n\nThese successes have, unsurprisingly, raised expectations, according to Bounouar.\n\n\"Since 1976, we have not been able to win the Africa Cup of Nations, can you imagine?\" he said.\n\n\"That's the only [senior] title in the history of Moroccan football, so it's high time we went for it.\"",

    "description": "On new years eve last year I told myself I wanted to really adopt AI. Let's talk about it.",
    "fullText": "On new years eve last year I told myself I wanted to really adopt AI. Let's talk about it.\n\nOne year ago I set a New Year's resolution for myself to be an AI optimist for 2025. Before this, I had been a bit of a skeptic, you might say, and I still am in my core. But I thought it would be an interesting perspective to go through 2025 with.\n\nIn the beginning of the year I went out hard. I wanted to use AI in every single part of my life. Personal and work. This was fun, and there were certainly some good use cases. For example, taking a photo of a whiteboard after a meeting, uploading to my Mac's Raycast chat instance, and asking an LLM to OCR what was on there. Cool, not groundbreaking.\n\nAt this point, I was still a heavy terminal and Neovim user. This is how I'd been working for the last 6 years or so. And I loved it. I created this really productive environment where I could fly through files. Going from idea to code has never really been the hard part for me. I think learning Vim and Neovim was one of the best things I've done for my career for the first 6 years. I would see colleagues of mine slowly click through an IDE with their mouse, while I would already have a draft PR out.\n\nAs the year went by, I started hearing more and more about Cursor. I tried it. Didn't like it, went back to Neovim. Then I heard more and more about Zed. Tried it, really liked it, but then went back to Neovim. I used some AI plugins for Neovim, like Copilot and gp.nvim, and it worked quite well.\n\nThen agentic editing started to surface. It was quite bad in the beginning. But after the summer of 2025, things really started accelerating. I gave Cursor another shot, and with the release of Composer 1, I found myself not going back to Neovim. When I did go back, I just cringed at the incredible latency and performance of Copilot. And not having gp.nvim actually implement the changes it suggested, but just displaying them made me realize the jump ahead Cursor had created for itself.\n\nComposer 1 and the agents panel is absolutely crazy. There's so much power here, and it can write a lot of code. Some pretty good, and some less. I really think it's great. But it's such a double edged sword.\n\nI think this is a term you've probably heard in other contexts in your life. If you can't remember, go back to your school days. Someone near you probably mentioned that when you write something down, you remember it better. I think this is interesting. Having an agent write your code and then you reviewing (i.e., reading) works. But the problem is that you won't build a mental model or deep understanding of the code.\n\nOn one hand I deeply believe in the previous paragraph. And, I want to go back to pure Neovim and write every single line of code by hand. Except boilerplate of course (this is something we all have to agree on is better with LLMs). But then I jump a few years ahead in my mind, and think about where the industry is in 10, 15, or even 20 years. I'm just 26 years old. I joined my first startup at 18 and I've been building web and mobile apps at all types of companies ever since. But where are we in 20 years? Will code even matter, or will English just be the next elevator level in the skyscraper of language abstractions?\n\nKnowing how your codebase works on a deeper level is really valuable. If a customer comes to you with a bug, you can't blame the LLM.\n\nYou know, uuhmm... I didn't actually write that code. But I'll check with the Claude.\n\nHow would you feel if a service provider you use in your company would answer something like that to a bug you report? Sure, they won't answer like that. But they'll think it. How does that feel to you? Probably not great. It doesn't bring a huge sense of trust in that company.\n\nI know there's real value in deeply understanding the code you write. Even if it's boring code at times, it's valuable. Taking ownership of what you ship to customers. After all, \"customers\" are just simple peasants like you and me. And I fucking hate when Netflix won't load half of the shows on my Samsung smart TV. You have to ask yourself what you expect from the products and services you use. And then apply those expectations to the products you build.\n\nSo, it seems like things are only going in one direction: abstractions. English to code. It kinda works. You can ship a ton. And your boss is probably happy because your team is delivering more features. Your users? Who knows. Maybe they're happy. But honestly, as a user, I don't give a hell if Netflix ships a bunch of new features. I just care about their core. If their new fancy features are all half-baked, laggy pieces of crap, I'll watch something on Apple TV instead.\n\nAnother thing that's worth reflecting on is that even though it might seem like everything is going in one direction in the insutry. It doesn't mean we have to go that route. It's not like there's just one final master goal to all of this. These are just private companies who want to sell us their services. And, you might not believe it... But we don't have to buy it.",

    "description": "Exclusive: Ancient forests and turquoise rivers of the Cochamó Valley protected from logging, damming and development",
    "fullText": "Exclusive: Ancient forests and turquoise rivers of the Cochamó Valley protected from logging, damming and development\n\nA wild valley in Chilean Patagonia has been preserved for future generations and protected from logging, damming and unbridled development after a remarkable fundraising effort by local groups, the Guardian can reveal.\n\nThe 133,000 hectares (328,000 acres) of pristine wilderness in the Cochamó Valley was bought for $63m (£47m) after a grassroots campaign led by the NGO Puelo Patagonia, and the title to the wildlands was officially handed over to the Chilean nonprofit Fundación Conserva Puchegüín on 9 December.\n\nThe now-protected ecosystem is 383 times the size of Manhattan’s Central Park, or 800 times as big as London’s Regent’s Park.\n\nThe lush, forested Cochamó Valley is home to waterfalls, emerald green rivers, hummingbirds and condors. The ancient forests hold groves of alerce trees that sprouted about 1,000BC, four centuries before the rise of the Roman empire.\n\nThe newly acquired lands hold 11% of the remaining alerce forests on Earth. Logged for their solid, water-resistant trunk, alerce wood was fashioned into ship masts and telephone poles.\n\nSparsely populated by a few remote homestead camps and rustic campgrounds, the Cochamó Valley is surrounded by 3,200ft (970 metre) granite cliffs that in 1997 lured climbers seeking the first ascent of rock faces on Cerro Trinidad.\n\nIn 2012, rancher families and lone cowboys living in the valley joined forces with tour operators, NGOs, climbers, backpackers and explorers in vociferous opposition to a $400m hydroelectric plan that included 150-metre transmission towers, access roads and complete disruption of the rural way of life along the Manso River. The communities then worked together to stop a high-end vacation home development and plans to pave roads through the valley.\n\n“Our goal was to transform threats into opportunities,” said José Claro, the president of Puelo Patagonia.\n\nClaro described how one large-scale project after another was stymied by Puelo Patagonia and the local community working together.\n\nThe conservation campaigns highlighted Cochamó’s importance as a biological corridor that could connect to the surrounding 1.6m hectares of protected lands in Chile and Argentina. A coalition of local and foreign NGOs known as Conserva Puchegüín then began recruiting donors to fund long-term conservation strategies.\n\nThe valley receives over 3 metres of rain a year, making industrial agriculture virtually impossible. Cattle grazing is difficult as the mountain slopes are nearly vertical.\n\nExcept for a few cave drawings attributed to native peoples from present-day Argentina who migrated along riverbanks, this corner of northern Patagonia reveals few signs of longstanding human habitation.\n\nThese never-logged forests and free-flowing turquoise rivers are a field biologist’s paradise. The area teems with ferns the size of beach umbrellas. The undergrowth of native bamboo makes bushwhacking through this temperate rainforest nearly impossible, even with a machete.\n\nThe dense underbrush prevents many larger mammals from migrating through the valley. Local species of deer known as pudu have adapted so they are rarely taller than 40cm.\n\n“You think about those trees being cut down or the valley flooded. It’s just terrifying,” said Alex Taylor, the chief executive of Cox Enterprises, who was first introduced to Cochamó in early 2025 by fellow fly fisher Yvon Chouinard, the founder of the clothing company Patagonia.\n\nTaylor returned to Atlanta with an idea for the James M Cox Foundation to support the protection of the valley. The other trustees agreed and approved a $20m donation.\n\n“It’s almost like the spiritual centre of the universe from a forest biodiversity standpoint,” said Taylor. “I can’t think of a place more pristine.”\n\nThe successful fundraising campaign to buy the land is the beginning of what is likely to be a decades-long project to conserve the homesteader way of life and the valley’s rich biodiversity.\n\n“How do we ensure that traditional living and practices that have been going on for the better part of a century or more don’t get disrupted?” said Alex Perry, the Latin America general manager for Patagonia, which has been funding local conservation groups in the Cochamó Valley for more than a decade and in 2024 donated $4m through the company’s non-profit owner, Holdfast Collective.\n\n“How do we make it so that this model is something that can be replicated and scaled and is attractive to the next generation?”\n\nWhile the 133,000 hectares may eventually be donated to the Chilean national park system, recently passed environmental legislation in Chile created a system that secures permanent protection of designated areas even when the land remains in private ownership.\n\nAs the valley’s popularity surges among hikers, climbers and horseback riders, a limit of 15,000 visitors a year has been set. Reservations are now required and a master plan of hiking trails, base camps and horse stables is being developed with direct participation from the local communities.\n\n“The beauty of the Pucheguín project is that it’s coming with an endowment,” said Anne Deane, the president of the Freyja Foundation which helped fund land purchases in the valley and recruited additional funders including the Wyss Foundation. “Cochamó is only going to get more and more popular, so it’s very important that there is an operating budget to support it.”\n\nUsing camera traps and through collaboration with residents, a survey of the area’s wildlife has begun. A small herd of Chile’s national symbol, the now-endangered huemul deer, was recently discovered.\n\nThere are no roads through the valley and electricity is generated house by house through solar or wind. The homes are often rough cabins set on riverbanks, allowing small motorboats to navigate up and down the Puelo River. Pack horses still haul in most food and supplies.\n\nThe Cochamó conservation project was inspired by the landmark conservation efforts of Kris and Doug Tompkins, who abandoned successful leadership roles at the Patagonia and Esprit clothing companies respectively, moved to a remote cabin in Patagonia and dedicated 25 years and $300m to creating national parks in Chile and Argentina.\n\nThe path to becoming a park may be different in Cochamó. The measly budget allocated for national parks in Chile – highlighted by the recent deaths of five hikers in Torres del Paine national park – has convinced many conservation advocates to look at creating private parks that combine conservation with low impact commercial operations such as family farms or a solar-powered craft brewery.\n\nThe plans for Cochamó are to place at least 80% in protected national park level status, while the remaining 20% will be zoned for multiple use, allowing locals to earn a living off tourism and traditional activities such as family farms and their small ranches.\n\nOn a recent hike through Cochamó, the connection between conservation and community was evident.\n\nA Chilean cowboy hauling a horse piled high with fruits, vegetables and canned food stopped to share news. His horse was pregnant. Rex, a neighbour’s dog, needed medicine. The remote bridge washed away by the floods was nearly rebuilt.\n\nStopping to chat in the cool fern forest, the cowboy spoke with excitement about the German tourists he would that evening be guiding down the mountain, on a path that his father helped build and that his children might one day continue to use and preserve.",

    "fullText": "US law enforcement officers say Meta and Snapchat routinely delay or reject warrants. The companies disagree\n\nMax Osterman was 18 when he connected with a drug dealer on Snapchat who used the handle skyhigh.303. Max would message him whenever he wanted to buy Percocet, and they would meet. After about a year, and just days after their last exchange, Max collapsed. The pills he ordered had been laced with fentanyl. He died from the overdose in February 2021 at his home in Broomfield, Colorado.\n\nThe dealer continued selling prescription painkillers until 2023, when he was jailed on two drug distribution convictions. When handing down the sentence, the judge said he was responsible for four deaths, yet he never faced charges for supplying the pills that killed Max.\n\n“Snapchat never gave this critical evidence, never took action, never stopped the dealer who had been selling drugs on their platform for years before Max’s death and even after,” said Kim Osterman, his mother. “It took three separate requests from law enforcement for Snapchat to even respond, and when they did, they claimed there was no information.”\n\nA police report reviewed by the Guardian shows a delay in obtaining data from the dealer’s Snapchat account, which investigators said they needed to definitively link him to Max’s death. The report also states that Snapchat did not provide law enforcement with any content from Max’s account apart from his user information. When Colorado detectives first sent Snap Inc, the app’s parent company, a production of records request for account information on skyhigh.3o3, it took more than two months to receive a reply. When the response did arrive, Snap said it would not comply, citing a grammar technicality in the order. The inclusion of a “/,” the company argued, made the request “ambiguous”, according to a field case report from the Broomfield police department. The company eventually sent detectives information on the drug dealer’s account, skyhigh.303, in response to several separate warrants law enforcement filed in the year after Max’s death. No content from Max’s Snapchat account was ever provided to law enforcement, the police report states.\n\nThe Guardian has reviewed four cases where Snap Inc and Meta have delayed or declined to comply with warrants and subpoenas requesting information related to serious crimes linked to their platforms. Eight law enforcement officers interviewed have said multiple cases reviewed by the Guardian are emblematic of a wider problem they face with the companies, which often delay or decline to comply with warrants and subpoenas requesting information related to serious crimes on their platforms. According to court records, police reports and interviews with law enforcement officials, these refusals and lags can derail investigations into crimes ranging from fentanyl deaths to child sexual exploitation.\n\nA Snap Inc statement reads: “Our deepest sympathies go out to the families who have suffered such heartbreaking loss. A critical part of our efforts to help keep our community safe includes our longstanding and crucial engagement with law enforcement to help bring criminals to justice for the harm they cause our community. In both instances, Snap responded to multiple legal requests relating to the cases, so the suggestion that we did not support these investigations is simply inaccurate.”\n\nMeta said in a statement: “We strongly disagree with the assertions made in this story, and our fast cooperation with law enforcement led to arrests in the cases in question. Last year, we received over 9,000 emergency requests from US authorities and resolved them within an average of 67 minutes – and even more quickly for cases involving child safety and suicide. To protect user privacy, it’s important that we follow appropriate legal processes and request clarifications where necessary, but we work to support law enforcement as much as we can.”\n\nThe spokesperson added that Meta produced data in 88% of the nearly 75,000 requests it received from US authorities between July and December last year.\n\nIn a statement, the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (ICMEC) called for clearer rules, faster processes and collaboration between law enforcement, lawyers and tech leaders reaching across the aisle.\n\n“Every day of delay puts a child at risk. It can exacerbate damage and even cost lives. We can’t afford to let the delays continue,” said Shawnna Hoffman, chief executive of ICMEC and a former legal technology expert witness. “But the problems now are real, and if cooperation and alignment can’t rapidly make these processes happen faster, then we would in principle support new regulations to force greater urgency.”\n\nWhen platforms are not responsive, suspects can go unidentified and arrests can be postponed, giving perpetrators more opportunities to offend and putting the public at risk, said eight federal and state law enforcement officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, as they were not authorised to speak to the media.\n\n“These suspects are often transient. They might be at college for a semester, or just crashing with a friend, and by the time we get the data, they’ve already moved on,” said one officer with the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) taskforce, a national network of law enforcement agencies dedicated to combating online child exploitation. “If we’d had the information in time, they would have been arrested. Instead, we show up and hear, ‘They moved out a few weeks ago.’”\n\nFor ICAC officers pursuing cases of online exploitation, two companies stand out for their lack of cooperation: Meta and Snap. Investigators say some refusals are based on minor technicalities. “It can be something as minimal as a dash or comma,” said another ICAC officer. “It feels like they’re playing legal games. We’ve had objections from companies over clerical details that delay cases for a while.”\n\nSuch lags can be especially devastating in cases of online child sexual exploitation and the production and distribution of child sexual abuse material, said members of law enforcement specializing in cases of crimes against children.\n\nIn June, a Boston court sentenced Charlese Horton, a registered sex offender, to at least 25 years in prison for kidnapping and assaulting a boy lured to meet them through Facebook. Investigators say solving the case was made more difficult when Meta did not fully comply with the subpoenas they sent as exigent requests for information they urgently needed to identify Horton.\n\n“It can be weeks or months when we send a search warrant for data before companies get back to us,” said a current ICAC commanding officer. “When we are finally able to knock on the door and find the child victim, we determine that there has been additional abuse since we were waiting on that search warrant return.”\n\nSubpoenas and warrants form the backbone of these investigations, allowing law enforcement to obtain evidence from social media profiles. Subpoenas can be issued by a court or government agency without needing a judge’s approval. With regards to social media, these legal orders can compel a company to provide basic account information such as a user’s name, email address or IP login records. They generally cannot access private communications. Warrants, which require judicial approval and a demonstration of probable cause, permit investigators to obtain sensitive material, such as private messages, photos and videos.\n\nPart of the tension between police and tech platforms stems from the legal framework that governs digital privacy and access to communications in the United States.\n\nThe fourth amendment, which prohibits “unreasonable searches and seizures” by the government, requires law enforcement to show probable cause and secure a judge’s approval before accessing private communications. In practice, that means investigators must obtain a search warrant before companies like Meta and Snap release sensitive material such as private messages.\n\nLayered on top of that barrier is the 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) and its Stored Communications Act (SCA) provision, which set rules for how companies store and disclose user data. Advocates for digital privacy say this law serves as one of the only federal protections in a country that relies on a haphazard patchwork of statutes to govern online behavior.\n\nCritics say the law is outdated, as it was written decades before social media or smartphones existed and includes ambiguities that tech companies use to slow-walk or reject requests.\n\n“They are looking for reasons not to give information,” said a former commander of a state ICAC taskforce, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “Big tech is going to protect their companies first. Their priority it’s not to share information. It’s to protect themselves from any liability.”\n\nOfficials say this resistance is unique to big tech. Law enforcement officials characterized the response of industries like banking as much quicker, a matter of days rather than weeks or months. While entities that refuse could theoretically be held in contempt, tech firms bank on low appetite from law enforcement to take them on, said law enforcement officials.\n\n“You send a grand jury subpoena to them, and they don’t give anything back,” said a lieutenant from ICAC. “Or sometimes they say, ‘We don’t have anything for what you requested, or we can’t find anything based on your request,’ and they won’t tell you why.”\n\nIn May, the Colorado governor, Jared Polis, vetoed a state bill on children’s online safety in the face of heavy lobbying from across industries. He cited the bill’s potential to “erode privacy, freedom and innovation” as the reason for his veto. The bill included a mandate for a 72-hour deadline for social media companies to respond to police requests, and to provide direct hotlines for law enforcement.\n\nTestifying in support of the bill before the state’s Senate judiciary committee in April, Brian Mason, the district attorney for Adams and Broomfield counties, where Max Osterman lived, stated that social media companies “regularly” failed to respond to legal documents they had been served in Colorado. Warrants, he said, often vanish into “a black hole”.\n\n“They’re massive social media companies that don’t seem to care when they get a valid warrant from a jurisdiction like mine in Colorado,” said Mason.\n\nIn child sex trafficking cases, limited access to digital records not only deepens the trauma for victims but also makes it harder to investigate crimes, members of law enforcement said.\n\nLaw enforcement officials note that when cases involve traumatized victims, their cooperation with investigations can be temporary. To avoid the investigation relying solely on the victim’s testimony, law enforcement focuses on building cases through digital evidence.\n\nEven in emergency cases – when police have reasonable grounds to believe someone is in imminent danger and file what they dub an “exigent request”, which is a legal demand meant to trigger immediate compliance – tech companies often pick and choose which requests to honor, according to five members of law enforcement. Investigators say those decisions come at a cost to public safety.\n\nBoston police’s investigation into Charlese Horton began after a 14-year-old boy was kidnapped and assaulted at gunpoint in an alley in the city’s Dorchester neighborhood. Four months later, the same boy was kidnapped again. He reported the attacks to police, and two more boys soon came forward with similar accounts. None of the victims knew each other, but all had been contacted through Facebook accounts tied to four aliases the attacker controlled, according to court documents.\n\nDetectives subpoenaed Meta for data on four accounts. Meta refused to honor the exigency requests for two of the accounts being used, without explanation, said two members of law enforcement. That decision, investigators said, likely allowed additional victims to go undiscovered.\n\n“Meta shouldn’t be the arbiter of what is and isn’t exigent,” said one member of law enforcement dealing with the case. “This was the company making its own judgment about whether we had an exigency case.”\n\nA statement from Meta asserts the company fully cooperated with the Boston police investigation.\n\n“Meta scrutinizes every law enforcement request, as bad actors have been known to use social engineering to access government email accounts so they can request information from tech companies,” a spokesperson said.\n\nIn a statement, Meta asserted that the two accounts it did not provide information on were actually duplicate requests. Law enforcement officers interviewed, however, dispute that characterization.\n\nLaw enforcement has no direct line to communicate with some companies to question decisions or press their case further. For Meta and Snap, requests are routed through a web portal that offers no phone number and no direct access to the employees deciding whether to release evidence, a point of frustration mentioned by almost all members of law enforcement who spoke to the Guardian.\n\n“We make it as easy as possible for law enforcement to submit legal requests via an online portal and provide regular training sessions to the FBI and US local law enforcement on how to send in valid requests,” said a Meta spokesperson. “Our dedicated law enforcement response team in the US is also in ongoing contact with law enforcement to support them on live cases as needed, and our legal teams are regularly in touch with prosecutors and investigators to help with legal issues.”\n\nWhen Michigan teen Jordan DeMay died by suicide after being targeted by Nigerian sextortion scammers on Instagram in 2022, Meta initially declined the Marquette county sheriff’s detectives’ requests, filed as exigent, for the transcripts of DeMay’s direct messages on the platform. This meant his family had to wait 48 hours for crucial details about why he died, and the sextortionists were able to continue to target other victims.\n\n“Possibly it wasn’t considered an emergency because Jordan was already dead,” said John DeMay, Jordan’s father. “It was only when the FBI got involved that the warrant was accepted.”\n\nDeMay, who now has a copy of the transcript of the conversation between Jordan and the sextortionists, said it is obvious from the dialogue how urgent the situation was.\n\n“They wrote to Jordan, ‘I’m gonna watch you die a miserable death.’ And, Jordan replies to say, ‘I’m killing myself.’ And they say, ‘Good, do it now,’” said DeMay. “After reading that transcript and knowing that the sextortionist’s account was still active, and somebody had already died, there’s no reason that Meta should have not given that information. There’s zero reason for that.”\n\nIn its statement, Meta noted that the justice department had publicly praised the company for cooperating with the FBI investigation into Jordan’s sextortionists. The company did not, however, address the early delays in the case, when the investigation was still being handled by local police.\n\nEven when companies do comply with warrants, the information they provide can be of little use. On 19 December 2024, 16-year-old Avery Ping died in Olympia, Washington, of a drug overdose after buying what he thought was ecstasy over Snapchat. The pills turned out to be a lethal mix of fentanyl, amphetamine and methamphetamine.\n\nAvery’s drug dealer had been under law enforcement surveillance since October 2024 in relation to other narcotics cases. Local police sent a warrant for the dealer’s Snapchat account data to Snap Inc on 5 November 2024 and waited 10 days. They did not receive a response from Snap until 25 November, when the company sent a file that law enforcement couldn’t open, said Aaron Ping, Avery’s father.\n\n“The detective told me they needed specific software to open it, and Snap didn’t give instructions on this,” said Ping. Ultimately, law enforcement could not open the file until early December.\n\n“Snap impeded on a big investigation on the dealer before Avery died. This guy was a prolific dealer, and had surveillance on his house, and they just were waiting for the Snapchat records,” said Ping. “The guy should have been in jail. Avery should be alive.”\n\nSnap Inc did not provide a response to these allegations.\n\n“Every day of delay means children remain in danger who could have been rescued, and there’s no legal consequence for dragging their feet,” said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project. “We need public visibility into how these companies perform. We need mandatory public reporting on response times and compliance rates. Self-regulation has failed – it’s time for lawmakers to act.”",

    "description": "A Reddit user provided information that helped identify Claudio Manuel Neves Valente as the suspect not only in the campus shooting but also in the murder of an M.I.T. professor.",
    "fullText": "Three days after the deadly shooting at Brown University, officers received an anonymous tip that stuck out from a flood of information. It directed the authorities to a post on Reddit.\n\n“I’m being dead serious. The police need to look into a grey Nissan with Florida plates, possibly a rental,” the Reddit user posted, according to an affidavit filed by the police in Providence, R.I.\n\nThat tip would later lead to a breakthrough not only in the search for the campus attacker but also the hunt for the suspect in the murder of a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It also ended the dayslong manhunt that had put both the Brown and M.I.T. communities on edge.\n\nA day after the Reddit post was made, the writer approached law enforcement officials and told them about his encounter with a suspicious man in Brown University’s Barus and Holley building.\n\nThe information “blew this case right open,” Attorney General Peter F. Neronha of Rhode Island said in a news conference Thursday.\n\nThe tipster, whom the police referred to only as John, said that he encountered the suspect inside a bathroom on the ground floor of the building between 1:45 p.m. and 2 p.m., around two hours before the first shots were reported. John said that the suspect’s clothing was inappropriate for the weather and that they had made eye contact.\n\nJohn told the police that he followed the man after he left the building to a Nissan with a Florida plate. But instead of entering the vehicle, the suspect started walking around the block, with John behind him. John said it was like “a game of cat and mouse.”\n\nAt one point, the two men spoke. According to the affidavit, John asked the suspect, “Your car is back there, why are you circling the block?” To which the suspect responded, “Why are you harassing me?” John went his own way soon after.\n\nMayor Brett P. Smiley of Providence told CNN that the Reddit tipster was a Brown graduate who had been pictured in a photograph released by the police. However, John wrote on Reddit on Thursday that he is not the man in the photograph.\n\n“He provided the Reddit tip initially. Anonymously,” Mr. Smiley said. “And then when we put the photo out and put the call out that we needed to talk to this person, he then turned up to a Providence police officer and was fully forthcoming. And so it’s sort of an amazing sequence of events, but really turned out to be critical to our investigation. We’re grateful to him.”\n\nWhen the police showed John images of the suspect’s car from safety cameras, he said: “That might be it.”\n\nIt was the breakthrough the authorities had been looking for.\n\nThe suspect’s vehicle was a key detail in the investigation. A Brown University faculty member had also described a suspicious vehicle in the same neighborhood, a gray sedan with Florida plates. It did not take long for investigators to find that the car was from an Alamo rental location in downtown Boston.\n\nAnd from the rental agreement, they got a name: Claudio Manuel Neves Valente.\n\nThen came more information about the suspect: He was a Portuguese national. Brown University said he was a former student, enrolled from the fall of 2000 through the 2001 spring semester. He was there for a Ph.D. in physics, but withdrew from that program in 2003.\n\nTravel records showed that years later, in 2017, Mr. Neves Valente returned to the United States as a legal permanent resident.\n\nAt this point, the investigations into the Brown University shooting and the murder three days later of Nuno F.G. Loureiro, a professor at M.I.T., appeared to converge.\n\nThrough surveillance footage, investigators tracked the gray Nissan to near Dr. Loureiro’s home. They also determined that the suspect drove that car to a storage unit in Salem, N.H., where they found the body of Mr. Neves Valente, with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, on Thursday night.\n\nThe investigators now also knew that Mr. Neves Valente had rented hotel rooms in Boston, as well as that storage unit. And according to Leah B. Foley, the U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts, Mr. Neves Valente and Dr. Loureiro had attended the same academic program in Portugal from 1995 to 2000.\n\nAt some point after the shooting at Brown, the plates on the suspect’s car were changed from Florida to Maine, Ms. Foley added.\n\nThe suspect’s motives in both attacks remain under investigation.\n\n“I think there’s a lot of unknowns,” said Mr. Neronha, the attorney general of Rhode Island. “In terms of why Brown? I think that’s a mystery.”\n\nVictor Mather contributed reporting.",

    "fullText": "From celebrity endorsements to digital fatigue, the once-obsolete white wire has become a fashion statement and a quiet act of opting out\n\nWith white-wired headphones endorsed by celebrities including Lily-Rose Depp, Paul Mescal, Bella Hadid and Apple Martin, a growing number of people are breaking away from wireless listening.\n\nFor inspiration, there is the Instagram account @wireditgirls, or a Balenciaga campaign featuring the model Mona Tougaard reclining bed, wired headphones in place.\n\nDaniel Rodgers, the fashion news editor at British Vogue, is familiar with the trend. “[It says] ‘I’m very effortless. I’m very nonchalant,” he says. “It’s become a real styleable accessory.”\n\nBut in a culture where the forward march of technology is often treated as compulsory, wired headphones represent more than aesthetics. “It’s an analogue way of opting out – of both tech but also life,” says Rodgers. “They’re visible in a way that AirPods aren’t. There is a sense of ‘do not disturb’.”\n\nThat symbolism is on full display on the cover of New York magazine’s latest issue, which features celebrities riding the subway: Debbie Harry with the Geese frontman Cameron Winter, Ben Stiller with the Knicks star Karl-Anthony Towns and Macaulay Culkin with the SubwayTakes presenter Kareem Rahma. The real story, however, is not the star power but the shared accessory in each image: wired headphones.\n\nThe pictures were taken by Hannah La Follette Ryan, the Brooklyn-based photographer behind the Instagram account @SubwayTakes, which documents New Yorkers on public transport. She says: “I see the revival as an extension of digital fatigue. Who wants another glitchy expensive gadget to charge?”\n\nPrice is clearly part of the appeal of wired headphones – Apple’s EarPods cost £17 compared with £99 for AirPods – but nostalgia is also a factor.\n\n“We’re seeing retro tech come back,” says Tom Morgan-Freelander, the deputy editor of the technology magazine Stuff. “And as part of that, brands are starting to bring back wired headphones.”\n\nHe says some younger consumers are switching to wired for sound quality, which is typically better with cables. “Bluetooth became the norm, and there was an acceptance that, for wireless convenience, you’re going to lose a bit of quality,” he adds.\n\nThen there is the issue of tangles. While wireless headphones are stored neatly in a case, wired varieties are often found in a knot at the bottom of a bag.\n\nLa Follette Ryan suggests this is part of the appeal. “The tangle is inevitable,” she says. “Think of a headphone knot as a more user-friendly Rubik’s Cube. Relish the opportunity to slow down and solve a little puzzle.”\n\nIf wired headphones have become the choice of the fashion-conscious despite these inconveniences, that could change soon. AirPods remain the bestseller at Currys but the retailer reports sales of Beats Solo 4 over-ear headphones have risen by 193% since last year.\n\nMorgan-Freelander also points to the £20 FiiO Snowsky Wind, a design that looks like the earphones worn with a Sony Walkman in the 1980s.\n\nRodgers still believes wired headphones have the edge. “Even though we are constantly being [sold upgrades], there’s a sort of disengagement [with wired headphones], which is always really hot, right?” he says. “You never want to look like you’re too into anything.”\n\nLa Follette Ryan, however, thinks there is room for every option. “I just bought a Discman and Sony headphones,” she says, “but I will always keep my wired headphones for sharing an earbud with a friend.”",

    "fullText": "AI stocks might look frothy, but Uber's embrace of the technology is transforming its operations and yielding huge financial benefits, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi says.\n\n\"You can debate whether or not there's a bubble in terms of valuation,\" Khosrowshahi told the \"On with Kara Swisher\" podcast in an episode released Thursday. \"The spending on the data centers, etc., is massive.\"\n\nBut AI has created a lot of value for Uber, \"not in the space-age stuff\" but in \"very practical\" ways, he said, such as determining what's shown next to a customer on their Uber Eats app after they select a carton of oat milk.\n\nThe latest AI models are \"enormously more effective\" than previous generations, and are producing \"hundreds of millions of dollars of benefit to us,\" he added.\n\nUber's AI spend \"has been well worth it and then some,\" he said. \"We are not building the picks and shovels but we're riding on top of that spend, absolutely.\"\n\nAI stocks have soared to record highs this year, but investors such as Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" have warned tech giants are overspending on microchips and data centers in their scramble for computing power, and will fall short of their fabulous growth forecasts.\n\nKhosrowshahi described his mobility, delivery, and freight company as an \"applied AI\" business. It's harnessing the tech for everything from setting prices and payments to matching, routing, identification, and dealing with customer complaints, he said.\n\nRoughly 80% to 90% of Uber's developers now use AI tools, he said. The company no longer has to keep scores of engineers on call to fix issues, and have them spend \"hours and hours\" figuring out what's gone wrong and where, as AI agents are now \"constantly looking at all of our systems\" and helping to diagnose problems, he continued.\n\n\"And then the human can look over the shoulder of the AI agent,\" he added.\n\nKhosrowshahi said that other tech bosses might see AI making their engineers 20% or 30% more productive, and conclude they need 20% to 30% fewer engineers, but that's not his attitude.\n\n\"I just think they become superhumans,\" he said. \"So we are actually hiring more engineers because every engineer got more valuable to me.\"\n\nKhosrowshahi also touched on Uber's partnership with Waymo and other robotaxi companies, saying the driverless vehicles are proving popular.\n\n\"There's something to be said for privacy,\" he said. While he loves talking to Uber drivers and hearing their stories, it's also \"nice being alone in the car.\"\n\nKhosrowshahi predicted that once self-driving cars become proven revenue generators, Wall Street will embrace them as investments and want their cars on Uber's platform to access its customers and maximize their returns.\n\nSimilar to how private equity and private debt companies are \"financing these data centers and buying Nvidia chips, that same ecosystem is going to be buying fleets of cars,\" he said.\n\nKhosrowshahi said that Uber could play a similar role to Marriott, which primarily manages or franchises hotels instead of owning them.",

    "description": "Spending a few hours a week helping others may slow the aging of the brain. Researchers found that both formal volunteering and informal acts, like helping neighbors or relatives, were linked to noticeably slower cognitive decline over time. The benefits added up year after year and didn’t require a huge time commitment. Even modest, everyday helping packed a powerful mental payoff.",
    "fullText": "Strong social ties are often linked to better health, and new research adds a brain benefit to that list. Researchers from The University of Texas at Austin and University of Massachusetts Boston report that regularly helping people outside your household can noticeably slow cognitive decline in middle-age and older adults.\n\nIn a study that followed more than 30,000 adults in the U.S. for two decades, people who consistently helped others outside the home showed a slower rate of age-related cognitive decline. The researchers found the decline was reduced by about 15%-20% among those who either volunteered formally or helped in informal ways, such as supporting neighbors, family, or friends. The strongest and most consistent benefit appeared when people spent about two to four hours per week helping others.\n\nThe findings were published recently in Social Science & Medicine. The work was supported by funding from the National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.\n\n\"Everyday acts of support -- whether organized or personal -- can have lasting cognitive impact,\" said Sae Hwang Han, an assistant professor of human development and family sciences at UT who led the study. \"What stood out to me was that the cognitive benefits of helping others weren't just short-term boosts but cumulative over time with sustained engagement, and these benefits were evident for both formal volunteering and informal helping. And in addition to that, moderate engagement of just two to four hours was consistently linked to robust benefits.\"\n\nFormal volunteering and informal helping both mattered\n\nThe study is among the first to examine formal volunteering and informal helping side by side. Informal helping can include giving someone a ride to a health appointment, watching children, doing lawn work, or helping prepare taxes for a neighbor, relative, or friend.\n\nPrevious reports suggest about 1 in 3 older Americans take part in scheduled or formal volunteering. In contrast, more than half regularly help people they know in these less formal ways.\n\n\"Informal helping is sometimes assumed to offer fewer health benefits due to its lack of social recognition,\" Han said. But in fact, \"It was a pleasant surprise to find that it provides cognitive benefits comparable to formal volunteering.\"\n\nLong-term national data strengthens the findings\n\nTo study these patterns over time, the researchers analyzed longitudinal data from the national Health and Retirement Study. The dataset includes a representative sample of U.S. residents over age 51, with information dating back to 1998.\n\nThe researchers accounted for other factors that can shape both helping behavior and cognitive health, including wealth, physical and mental health, and education. Even after considering those influences, cognitive decline tended to slow when people started helping others and continued to do so. The results also suggest that the benefits may grow when helping becomes a steady routine year after year.\n\n\"Conversely, our data show that completely withdrawing from helping is associated with worse cognitive function,\" Han said. \"This suggests the importance of keeping older adults engaged in some form of helping for as long as possible, with appropriate supports and accommodations in place.\"\n\nWhy this may matter for public health and aging\n\nThe researchers argue these results strengthen the case for thinking about volunteering, helping, and neighborhood connection as public health issues. This may be especially important later in life, when conditions tied to cognitive decline and impairment, including Alzheimer's, are more likely to develop.\n\nThe paper also points to related work by the same lead researcher. Another recent study led by Han found that volunteering helped counter the harmful effects of chronic stress on systemic inflammation -- a known biological pathway linked to cognitive decline and dementia. The benefit was strongest among people with higher levels of inflammation.\n\nTaken together, these findings suggest helping others may support brain health in more than one way. It may reduce the physical strain linked to stress, and it may strengthen social bonds that provide psychological, emotional, and cognitive support. As societies age and concerns about loneliness and isolation grow, the results also support continued efforts to keep people involved in ways that let them contribute, even after cognitive decline has begun.\n\n\"Many older adults in suboptimal health often continue to make valuable contributions to those around them,\" Han said, \"and they also may be the ones to especially benefit from being provided with opportunities to help.\"\n\nOther authors on the study were former UT postdoctoral researcher Shiyang Zhang and Jeffrey Burr of the University of Massachusetts Boston.\n\nMaterials provided by University of Texas at Austin.

    "description": "Texas Pacific Land has generated substantial returns for long-term investors as Permian Basin oil and gas production has surged.",
    "fullText": "Texas Pacific Land is a high-margin cash cow.\n\nIts land is valuable because it's located in the largest oil-and-gas-producing region in the United States.\n\nThe company is one of the safest ways to invest in growing oil and gas production.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Texas Pacific Land ›\n\nNetflix captured the spotlight in November when it executed its long-awaited 10-for-1 stock split. With just two weeks left in 2025, many investors probably figure they'll have to wait for 2026 for more high-profile splits.\n\nEarlier this month, S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) component Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE: TPL) announced a 3-for-1 stock split. Trading of the split-adjusted shares will take place on Dec. 23.\n\nHere's why Texas Pacific is no ordinary oil and gas company and why the high-margin cash cow could be an excellent gift for your portfolio this December.\n\nTexas Pacific's stock split will triple the number of shares outstanding while reducing the share price by two-thirds, making it easier for investors to buy one full share of the company at around $280 per share. This compares to around $840 per share at the time of this writing.\n\nStock splits can indicate that management is confident in a company's future earnings growth and thus, a higher future stock price. Even though stock splits don't impact a company's value or market capitalization, they're still generally received favorably by investors.\n\nWhat makes Texas Pacific's split particularly interesting is that the stock is down 24.1% year to date -- but stock splits tend to occur after a stock has run up in price. To make matters even more interesting, the company issued a 3-for-1 stock split in March 2024.\n\nIt's incredibly rare for a company to issue stock splits in back-to-back years, but Texas Pacific more than doubled last year, has crushed the S&P 500 over the last five years, and is up 18-fold over the last decade. There are plenty of reasons to believe it has a long runway for future earnings growth.\n\nThe oil and gas industry is capital-intensive. Upstream exploration and production companies are the most sensitive to fluctuations in oil and gas prices. Midstream companies, which transport and store hydrocarbons, tend to have less price sensitivity due to long-term contracts but are incredibly capital-intensive and depend on growing demand to justify infrastructure spending. Similarly, the margins of downstream refining and marketing companies can fluctuate based on input costs, such as oil prices and the cyclical demand for refined products.",

    "fullText": "CHICAGO, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Allyson Lopez had been hoping for business to bounce back at her dress shop in Chicago's Little Village neighborhood, which specializes in ballgowns for quinceaneras, a coming-of-age ritual in many Latino communities celebrating a girl's 15th birthday. Instead, this week brought the return of the federal immigration raids that have emptied the normally vibrant streets.\n\nThe first phase of the Department of Homeland Security deportation campaign, named \"Operation ​Midway Blitz,\" racked up over 4,200 arrests across the city in under three months. The operation rattled Chicago, but for Little Village, the working-class Mexican neighborhood that was repeatedly targeted, the effect has been catastrophic.\n\nThe return of roving U.S. ‌Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino on Tuesday in a large convoy of agents in camouflage, some with assault rifles peeking through car windows, was met by jeers and whistles from dozens of protesters who livestreamed the encounters on social media.\n\nAt Estela's Bridal, a second-generation family business, Lopez specializes in custom designs, which sell for ‌an average of $1,000. It can take 16 hours to make a dress, fitting the shimmering fabrics to size, and adding embroidered flowers, rhinestones and sequins. She said she lost 90% of her clients during the first wave of arrests as people decided to stay home out of fear of immigration agents.\n\nBUSINESS STRUGGLES TO MAKE RENT\n\n\"We’re going to suffer again as businesses,\" Lopez said. “We didn’t even make the rent this month, so it’s scary.\"\n\nA DHS spokesperson did not respond when asked about the impact of the raids on businesses.\n\nEven before Bovino's return, Little Village had been deflated by the raids.\n\nThe tourists who came to the \"Mexican Capital of the Midwest\" to eat tacos, sweet bread and tamales and to shop for quinceanera dresses, pinatas and Mexican chiles disappeared. Dozens of neighborhood residents were detained or deported, community leaders said. Others went ⁠into hiding.\n\n\"It's like those old Western movies where all you see is tumbleweeds blowing in ‌the breeze,” said Roxana, a 42-year-old hair salon owner from Guatemala. She declined to share her last name or immigration status out of fear of retaliation from immigration agents.\n\nIn her empty hair salon, with half the chairs wrapped in plastic, Roxana pulled back her neatly styled bangs to reveal patches of thinning hair, which she said started falling out from the stress of an 80% drop in revenue since ‍the start of the immigration enforcement campaign.\n\nAs the Border Patrol convoy descended on Little Village again this week, Roxana shuddered. The salon was open, but devoid of customers.\n\n\"They've broken into the neighborhood again,\" she said. \"It's definitely shocked and devastated us because it wasn't something that we were expecting.\"\n\nA NEIGHBORHOOD'S COMMERCIAL HEART\n\nRoxana's salon sits near the stucco arch that marks the beginning of 26th Street, a two-mile-long strip of shops, bakeries and restaurants that has become the second-most profitable shopping corridor in the city, according to the Little Village Chamber of Commerce. Many business owners said their savings dwindled ​after customers, including people who are in the U.S. legally, stopped visiting for fear of immigration officers.\n\nBefore the immigration crackdown, the shops selling elaborate ballgowns, glittering tiaras and satin flower bouquets, were joyous places, where girls giggled and twirled in their dresses ‌to the satisfaction of their mothers, shop owners said.\n\nBut anxiety over venturing outside – as well as fears that big parties could become targets for immigration enforcement – have hit Little Village’s quinceanera shops hard.\n\nTwo shop owners said they lost 90% of their revenue to the initial stages of Midway Blitz.\n\nEvelyn Flores, the owner of the Alborada quinceanera store, said she laid off seven staff members. “I can't sleep at night right now, and during the day I'm always freaking out.”\n\nMaria Ortiz, who owns a shop selling party supplies, said there are days when nobody walks into her store.\n\nFor one family, the aftershocks of the fall raids have lingered for weeks. Kamila, 15, said she has been afraid to leave her apartment other than to go to school after her cousin was detained by immigration agents in November while on his way to a job as a rug installer. He had been living in the U.S. for 18 years without legal status.\n\n“I’m scared. We can’t step outside because they might be waiting for us,\" she said.\n\nAsked for ⁠comment, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said: “There’s no reason to be afraid of law enforcement, unless you are breaking ​the law.\"\n\nThe cousin’s small apartment sits mostly as he left it - the bed unmade and his fluffy cream-colored dog, Peluchin, scampering through the apartment. Every day ​since his owner was detained, Peluchin pushes the dusty window blinds aside with his small snout to stare for hours at the street, waiting for him to return, a neighbor who comes by to walk him said.\n\n“All his dreams, all his effort, all his work – it’s here, empty,” said Sofia, Kamila’s mother and a 47-year-old housekeeper.\n\n“My daughter is 15 years old, she shouldn’t be living like this,” said Sofia, who came ‍to the U.S. from Mexico without legal status and is considering ⁠self-deporting. “There’s not a life here.”\n\nOn a recent afternoon, the Little Village Community Council hummed with overlapping voices as people coordinated school pick-ups, shared videos, and called family members of people who were detained.\n\nThe LVCC president, Baltazar Enriquez, has led local resistance to immigration enforcement, organizing patrols for federal agents and distributing plastic whistles now used across the city to warn of immigration agents in the area.\n\nThe tight-knit nature of “La Villita,” the Spanish name for Little Village, has given residents an ⁠organizing edge as they take to WhatsApp, Facebook and Signal groups to coordinate. Though Little Village has long struggled with bouts of gun violence and has the highest number of gang-related crimes in the city, residents said they felt safe before federal agents came to town.\n\nOther forms of resistance have been quieter – like Vicky Martinez, ‌a 55-year-old resident, who drops off groceries for friends and neighbors who are too scared to go to the store.\n\n\"It just feels like you're in prison. We don't even know what they're gonna throw at us,” ‌Martinez said.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A U.S. senator said Wednesday that she is pausing the nomination for the top Coast Guard job because leaders appeared to have “backtracked” on a commitment to ensure that swastikas and nooses are considered hate symbols and prohibited from being displayed.\n\nSen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., said Adm. Kevin Lunday’s nomination for Coast Guard commandant is on hold until she has clear answers.\n\n“As it appears that Admiral Lunday may have backtracked on his commitment to me to combat antisemitism and hate crimes and protect all members of the Coast Guard,\" Rosen posted on social media, \"I will be placing a hold on his nomination until the Coast Guard provides answers.\"\n\nThe situation is the last development in the Coast Guard's revision of its policy on swastikas, nooses and other hate symbols, which has sparked an uproar. It comes as antisemitism has been on the rise, including a mass shooting targeting Jews celebrating Hanukkah at Sydney's Bondi Beach that killed 15 people Sunday.\n\nThe Coast Guard's planned policy change emerged publicly last month. It called symbols like swastikas and nooses “potentially divisive.” The new policy stopped short of banning them, instead saying that commanders could take steps to remove them from public view and that the rule did not apply to private spaces, such as family housing.\n\nIt was a shift from a yearslong policy that said such symbols were “widely identified with oppression or hatred” and called their display “a potential hate incident.”\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Coast Guard, said there “was never a ‘downgrade’\" in policy language.\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a DHS spokesperson, said in a statement that the change in fact “strengthens our ability to report, investigate, and prosecute those who violate longstanding policy.”\n\n“The symbols listed in the policy include, but are not limited to, nooses, swastikas, and any symbols or flags that have been adopted by hate-based groups to represent supremacy, racial or religious intolerance, antisemitism, or any other form of bias,” McLaughlin said.\n\nWhen the changes first emerged, Rosen and Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., who lead a bipartisan antisemitism task force, pressed the Coast Guard \n\nThe Coast Guard, however, is sticking with the language that describes the display of nooses or swastikas as “potentially divisive\" in the final policy published this week, according to a person familiar with the situation who was unauthorized to discuss it and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe Coast Guard has insisted that the final policy is superseded by Lunday's memo that ensured such symbols would be “prohibited,” the person said. But the final version of the new policy retains the wording that calls those items “potentially divisive.\"\n\nThe Washington Post first reported on the new policy moving forward.",

    "fullText": "Restoration on the 4,400-year-old Pyramid of Sahura led researchers to create a more comprehensive blueprint of the structure.\n\nUsing LiDAR imaging, the team confirmed the presence of previously unknown chambers that were likely used as storage rooms.\n\nThe next step will be entering the rooms that likely held royal burial objects.\n\nStorage rooms aren’t always the most enthralling places to discover or investigate. But when those storage rooms are 4,400 years old and were previously a complete mystery, things get a little more interesting.\n\nPlus, any chance to uncover ancient royal burial objects is an exciting one.\n\nResearchers surveying the Pyramid of Sahura—a 4,400-year-old Egyptian ruin built as the first burial site for a king at Abusir—discovered multiple storage rooms, the existence of which was previously entirely unknown.\n\nConservation and restoration work has been ongoing at the 155-foot-tall site since 2019, but a research team only recently discovered the original dimensions of the pyramid and realized the initial floor plan of the antechamber had deteriorated over time. When this structural decline occurred, old walls gave way to new retaining walls, changing some of the interior makeup. While researchers working in the pyramid in 1836 had believed that passages found full of “debris and rubbish” could have led to storage rooms, others later disagreed, and the passageways weren’t fully explored.\n\nBut that has all changed. An Egyptian-German team discovered both the passages—proving the 1836 discovery correct—and eight storerooms in the ancient pyramid.\n\n“Although the northern and southern parts of these magazines, especially the ceiling and the original floor, are badly damaged, remnants of the original walls and parts of the floor can still be seen,” the team wrote in a news release from the University of Würzburg.\n\nTo get a full view of the chambers, the team employed 3D laser scanning with a portable LiDAR scanner. This provided detailed surveys of the inside of the pyramid. “This advanced technology enabled comprehensive mapping of both the extensive external areas and the narrow corridors and chambers inside,” the team wrote. “The frequent scans provide real-time updates of progress and create a permanent record of exploration efforts.”\n\nSahura sits amongst the Abusir complex, a popular burial site near the Nile River for pharaohs of the Fifth Dynasty of ancient Egypt. While not as illustrious as other ancient pyramid complexes, the necropolis contains 13 key structures.\n\nFinding and mapping the unknown storerooms is just one step in the process for exploring Sahura. Next comes the actual restoration of the chambers, a process which the team says they expect to “revolutionize the view of historical development of pyramid structures and challenge existing paradigms in the field.”\n\nLofty goals for a suite of storage areas.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "Remnants of a wall built thousands of years ago are beginning to emerge from the bottom of the ocean.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nRuins of a prehistoric stone wall submerged off the northwest coast of France may be evidence that a sunken city of legend actually existed.\n\nThe megalithic structure is thought to be about 7,000 years old, and could have been used either as a trap for fish or to protect a nearby settlement from flooding.\n\nThis find could mean that more submerged ruins could be in the region, ready to tell the story of a time when Mesolithic hunter-gatherer societies transitioned to Neolithic settlements.\n\nAtlantis may only exist in legends (unless it is actually recovered from the ocean someday), but another sunken city that inspired a myth is now rising from the deep.\n\nAn island partly submerged in water gave the Brittany region of France its own local lore for thousands of years. Off the coast of the Ile de Sein, the ruins of a 7,000-year-old wall that once belonged to a Stone Age civilization were spotted by marine archaeologists almost thirty feet beneath the surface. Discovered by geologist Yves Fouquet while he was studying undersea depth charts determined by radar, it appeared as a suspicious line at the edge of an undersea valley, something nature could not have possibly created. What remains of this wall is thought to have been either a fish weir or a dyke built to protect against rising waves.\n\nFurther analysis using LIDAR data found eleven structures, which could have only been made by the hands of humans, at the bottom of the ocean. Relative sea level data, which reflects changes in sea level and vertical land movement, showed that they dated back to sometime between 5,800 and 5,300 BCE, a time of transition between Mesolithic hunter-gatherer lifestyles and the permanent Neolithic settlements. Since the shoreline then was several miles from where it is today, evidence of human occupation has long since been submerged underwater.\n\nFouquet and his research team realized that what they had found was at least 500 years older than the first megaliths raised by Neolithic populations in Brittany.\n\n“Due to the difficulties in accessing these sites (strong tidal currents, high hydrodynamic conditions, seaweed cover), little archaeological work has been carried out in the deep areas of the Brittany coast,” he said in a study recently published in the International Journal of Nautical Archaeology. “The low resolution of nautical charts also explains the virtual absence of archaeological knowledge for these periods.”\n\nWhile some evidence of Late Mesolithic coastal human populations in the region has been found, such as shell middens near the shore and megaliths in waters further out, the ocean has not given up many artifacts. Aerial observations did identify prehistoric fish weirs in the Molène archipelago where the island is located, and it is possible that at least some of the megalithic fragments near Ile de Sein had once supported a structure of sticks and branches meant to trap fish in the retreating tide. Together, the fragments weigh 3,300 metric tons, which can also support the idea of larger structures built to prevent flooding when the sea level rose.\n\nWhatever this wall was used for, it was designed to stand up to storms and erosion. Monoliths, or standing stones within the megalithic structure, are morphologically similar to the menhirs of inland Brittany and the sarsens of Stonehenge. The largest were nearly ten feet high. How this structure’s monoliths, slabs, blocks, and boulders were arranged, suggests complex architecture that has not been found in other nearby fish weirs. They are also unusually larger. The researchers think multiple stages of construction and maintenance involved raising the structure with blocks as the relative sea level continued to rise, and monoliths that are deeply anchored were probably meant to resist turbulence.\n\nMesolithic and Neolithic communities who built and reinforced the megalith must have had enough technical skill and social organization to quarry the monoliths and other rocks, transport them and incorporate them into a large and enduring structure. There is also a link to the City of Ys, a Breton legend passed down through oral tradition over the centuries. Mythical or not, this city is thought to have been submerged in the Bay of Douarnenez just east of of Ice de Sein. The legendary city might have actually emerged in prehistory.\n\n“The discoveries […] allow us to question the origin of the history of the city of Ys,” said Fouquet, “not from the historical legends and their numerous additions, but from scientific findings that may be at the origin of this legend.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "He told his physician he couldn’t stand or sit without “significant pain,” authorities say.\n\nHousehold chores were anything but routine.\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol Officer Jordan Roy Lester claimed a medical retirement was the only recourse because of a debilitating injury, according to authorities. Then the department’s internal affairs investigators observed Lester on property he'd newly purchased cutting down trees, stacking firewood and operating heavy machinery.\n\nFast-forward two years and the 17-year veteran pleaded guilty in Sacramento County court on Wednesday to felony insurance fraud and was sentenced to 270 days in a county jail.\n\nLester, 45, is also on two years' formal probation and has been ordered to pay $232,829 in restitution to the CHP and $127,791 to the state compensation insurance fund.\n\nHe’ll also lose his service and pension credit for the years in which fraud was committed.\n\n“We take workers’ compensation fraud very seriously as it has an immediate and lasting financial impact on employers and delays medical care and financial assistance to employees legitimately injured at work,” Sacramento County Dist. Atty. Thien Ho said in a statement.\n\nHo added: “To have a peace officer commit this fraud is not only a violation of their duty to serve and protect with integrity, but it is also a violation of public trust.”\n\nLester was arrested in Quincy, in the Plumas National Forest of Northern California, in August 2024 after a multiyear investigation by the CHP's Workers’ Compensation Fraud Investigation Unit. Lester filed a workers' compensation claim in July 2021, though his superiors said the injury was “not significant,” according to the Sacramento County District Attorney's office. He was not taken off duty.\n\nLester had been assigned to the CHP's Central Division but briefly was moved to Quincy, according to the CHP office there. The home he purchased was located in Quincy.\n\nOn his days off he worked the property, according to the D.A.’s office, and eventually reached out to a former officer about obtaining medical retirement, according to authorities.\n\nIf he'd succeeded in getting medical retirement, he would have received 85% of his salary for life, tax-free, the D.A.’s office said.\n\nAs a CHP officer, Lester earned more than $260,000 in pay and benefits in 2021, according to the public pay database Transparent California.\n\nIn January 2022, Lester visited a doctor to have his claim substantiated, authorities said. He immediately was taken off his normal shift. His fortunes unraveled not long after when investigators witnessed him on his property engaging in “heavy physical activity,” according to the D.A.’s office.\n\nAn independent medical examiner tested Lester in February 2024 and said that not only could Lester “perform all work duties,” but the CHP veteran also “exaggerated his complaints,” according to the D.A.’s office.\n\nHe was arrested six months later.\n\nA.

    "description": "After surviving a heart attack and a stroke, taking GLP-1s has helped 47-year-old ShantaQuilette Carter-Williams get her health back on track.",
    "fullText": "Starting a GLP-1 wasn’t really a choice for ShantaQuilette Carter-Williams. “My doctor pretty much gave me an ultimatum and said that if I did not lose the weight, I was probably going to die in the next five years,” she tells Yahoo. That was in 2023, and Carter-Williams had already survived a heart attack and a stroke in her early 40s, and had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Her doctor prescribed her Ozempic, and Carter-Williams didn’t expect the drug to do much other than control her insulin levels.\n\nBut two years on and 160 pounds lighter, starting the medication has helped to open a new chapter in Carter-Williams’s life. “I became more conscious of how I eat and how I respect my body, and of actually being an active participant in my rescue,” she says. She’s also had a reinvention; the former accountant is now a speaker, content creator, health advocate and comedian. With her doctor's guidance, Carter-Williams weaned herself off of Mounjaro in February 2025. While research shows that some two-thirds of GLP-1 users regain most of the weight they lost within a year, Carter-Williams has, remarkably, been able to maintain her size and improved health. She credits the new habits she's learned and her determination to avoid another stroke or heart attack. But Carter-Williams knows that she may not be able to maintain her weight on her own forever. \"If I need to go back on the medication, I will,\" she says. \"I hope that I don't have to do that, but I'm not embarrassed to if it's necessary.\"\n\nIn this installment of On My Weigh, Carter-Williams explains in her own words how taking a GLP-1 helped her turn her health around and learn that “to truly love yourself is to take care of yourself inside and out.”\n\nName: ShantaQuilette Carter-Williams\n\nThe method: Ozempic, 12.5 milligrams from February 2022 until October 2023, then Mounjaro, 15 milligrams until weaning off of GLP-1s in February 2025\n\nThe goal: I had had a heart attack and stroke, and I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, as well as being obese. My doctor did not think that was in my best interest. So she put me on Ozempic to regulate my insulin but said it could also help me lose weight.\n\nProgress report: The medication put me in remission from my type 2 diabetes. My blood pressure is regulated, I’m down 160 pounds, and here’s the biggest thing: I went to my neurologist a couple of months ago because I’ve had a brain injury, and I’ve been having severe brain fog. So I was like, “Is this perimenopause or am I coming down with dementia?” I got a full blood workup done. When the nurse came to give me my results, she said, “This is the best bloodwork we’ve seen in this office — not just for you, not just for your age or gender — but in this office all year.”\n\nFood noise volume: Scale of 1 to 10? My food noise was a 25. But now I would say my food noise is sometimes maybe a 2.\n\nI wake up between 5 and 7 a.m., and I feel good. I wake up, and I choose me. I am a woman in perimenopause, so the bounce-back after a full day isn’t quite the same as it used to be. But the difference is that I was 160 pounds heavier and getting up and dealing with health issues. I can’t imagine being where I was in terms of my weight and health five years ago, and having to get up in the morning and deal with all the perimenopause symptoms that I am now.\n\nI’m more of a morning person now, but I don’t rush it when I wake up. I allow my nervous system to do what it’s supposed to do. I start the day with my affirmations and a good laugh because it decreases your stress hormone [cortisol] and gives you dopamine. Before, it wasn’t like that, because I was achy, groggy, overweight, tired, not feeling well — all these things. Back then, I could stay in bed until 10 or 11 a.m. just lying there. I realized that wasn’t always good; it was just my body telling me what it can and cannot do.\n\nBefore starting on a GLP-1, if we had fried chicken the night before, I might wake up and eat a piece of fried chicken and some eggs or just whatever was in the fridge. It wasn’t like, “Oh, I’ll have a traditional breakfast.” If I wanted some boudin from New Orleans in the morning, I was gonna have it.\n\nNow, I will start my day with a protein drink or one of the juices that my daughter makes. She and my husband are really good support. Sometimes, I’ll wake up and go to my office with a protein drink and lemon water. Then, my husband will come in with some eggs and potatoes to make sure I eat.\n\nOne thing that ShantaQuilette is going to do is put on some clothes to feel good about herself. She is going to love herself. Any time I was looking in the mirror, I’ve always seen me and felt good. Getting ready is not a luxury to me — it’s a requirement to feel good, and that is the ultimate joy. And it’s about being free. But, after my stroke, there was a time when I had really just let myself go and was going through this big, deep depression.\n\nSince starting a GLP-1, I feel good, like I always did, but there’s something different. It’s a glow, and I think that comes from my mindset and knowing that I’m getting better and not getting worse. But I did go from a size 22 to a size 4. For a while, I was still trying to buy my clothes too big, like, OK, I don't know my size. I hung onto my old clothes for a while, in case I got big again. But I realized, that’s not the mindset. I told myself, “Why are you talking about moving backwards when you’re going to be moving forward?” Now I feel confident to wear the things I want to.\n\nI went to Fashion Week in February, and I used to frown on those designers like, “Why can’t I wear this in a size 22, I’d still look good?” I’ll still always fight for that because the girl I was will always be there. But it feels good to know that I can actually buy something that’s on the runway.\n\nThese days, I love Pilates, my walking pad and calisthenics. But the truth of the matter is that, due to my heart condition and age, I’m now more limited in some of the exercises that I can do than I once was. I used to love lifting heavy weights, but because I’ve had a stroke and other health issues, I can’t do those things.\n\nSo, a couple of times a week, I get up and go for a walk outside, first thing. I have a weighted hula hoop. It’s so important that we all get at least three days of exercise a week, at least 45 minutes each day, especially when you’re at an age when osteoporosis starts. It makes for a better quality of life. Like getting ready, exercise is not a luxury, it’s a requirement.\n\nBefore: Give me some Popeyes, give me some Williams Chicken, some fried chicken fried in the hardest, hottest grease. Now, I’m not strict with myself, but I try not to eat stuff that’s really bad, and I do try to limit my sugar to 25 milligrams a day, and I’m conscious of my sodium levels.\n\nNow, I love to level up on my fruits and veggies. I enjoy eating what I want to eat, but I do it in a healthier way. I often have a sandwich or a salad for lunch. I love to have cucumber and pineapple mixed together with some low-sodium Tajin on them, or a good tomato and cucumber salad.\n\nI stopped taking Mounjaro in February of 2025, because even when my doctor and I tried to stretch the time between doses and I was on a lower maintenance dose, I was still losing weight. I didn’t want to lose any more weight because I got to a point where I was like, “I’m going to be invisible in a minute.” But when I was taking a GLP-1, I didn’t really even think about it. When it was weekly, I’d take my GLP-1 shot every Tuesday or every Thursday. But I was pretty inconsistent with the days, and sometimes I’d take it in the morning, and sometimes in the evening.\n\nI stopped drinking long before I got on a GLP-1, just as a protocol for better health. When I started losing weight, I encouraged a lot of my friends to think about doing a GLP-1. At first, a lot of them were like, “I’m not doing that, it’s gonna make you blind, it’s gonna make you dead.” Well, that’s where I was on my way to if I didn’t try Ozempic. I got some encouragement sharing my story online, and it was great seeing that I was inspiring other people to be the CEOs of their own health. But at times I felt hurt or misunderstood. Not one person ever walked up to me and said, “Girl, you look like you’re getting too big.” But as soon as I lost weight, people were like, “Oh my God, don’t lose any more.” Well, you’d never tell me to raw-dog my heart condition, or my pancreas, and not take insulin.\n\nBut I also decided I would start doing things that I had never done. In 2023, I went on a retreat in Costa Rica. I was able to canyon 300 feet down the side of a cliff; I went white-water rafting and ziplining (I would never do that again, but I did it). I did all of these things that I didn’t have the strength or courage to do before because I didn’t think I was in good enough shape. I’m glad I got those things off my bucket list. And really just being able to enjoy life and people. My happy hour is that this experience gave me purpose. And I realized that purpose is not what you do, it’s who you do it for. I want to live, I want to be better, I want to be here for my grandchildren. And I’m sharing my story because my testimony is for someone else, so they can change their lives as well.\n\nIn my family, food is fellowship. Food has always brought me joy, but it got to the point where I was not able to control it and control my weight. With a GLP-1, my appetite is suppressed, so I’m able to enjoy it in moderation.\n\nNow, my husband, daughter (who lives with us) and I are very conscious of eating the things we enjoy, but doing it in a healthier way. So, if we’re eating spaghetti, we use ground turkey instead of beef. When we have stuffed bell peppers, we use ground chicken. The other night, my daughter made hot honey lemon salmon with broccoli, zucchini and cilantro lime brown rice. She makes really good fried and baked chicken, and she makes sure to make smaller pieces for me.\n\nMy daughter does a really good job of meal prepping and making juices. My husband does his best, but he has a sweet tooth. But everybody in my life is a part of this process. I’ve come to realize how my choices affect my family. They don’t want to see me sick; they don’t want to see me die. They don’t want to see me die. If I’m not here, that’s trauma that they have to deal with too. So they keep me accountable, and we are all active participants in my rescue.\n\nBefore I got on Ozempic, my doctor had tried to put me on Wegovy or Saxenda. It was going to be $1,600 a month. I was like, “I’m gonna die because I can’t afford that.” It’s hard to be in a country where we should all have free health care, and things like Ozempic should be like a bottle of Tylenol. Finally, when I found out I had type 2 diabetes, I was able to get Ozempic, and then Mounjaro, for $25 a month. But it’s so sad that so many people need these medications, and the only thing that’s holding them back is money.\n\nWhen it comes to food expenses, we all know it is cheaper to go get a cheeseburger at McDonald’s than it is to go to Whole Foods and get a salad. But you have to decide what you want and budget for it. We don't want to keep people sick, and the best way to be healthy is to eat healthy. I think we fail because we try to go big. It doesn’t have to be the fanciest salad. So just buy some lettuce and tomatoes and make some lemon and olive oil dressing and start there.\n\nThis has been edited for length and clarity.",

    "fullText": "John Paul Miller has been indicted on accusations of harassing his wife Mica Miller in the lead up to her suicide in 2024\n\nAuthorities allege on one occasion, John Paul contacted Mica as many as 50 times in a single day\n\nAccording to authorities, John Paul bought a tire-slashing device and shared information about Mica's car before her tires were found slashed\n\nDisgraced South Carolina pastor John Paul Miller, who came under the spotlight following his wife Mica Miller's 2024 death, has been indicted on allegations he stalked and harassed her before she died.\n\nMica, 30, was found dead at the Lumber River State Park in Orrum, N.C. on April 27, 2024, the Robeson County Sheriff's Office said at the time. Her death was ruled a suicide, even though her loved ones had expressed suspicions there was more to the case.\n\n\"This has to be at least looked into deeply. There’s got to be some accountability here,” Kenn Young, a friend of Miller's, told WDPE days after her death. \"Because yeah, a tragic life was lost, and it’s not just as simple as mental health issues.\"\n\nMuch of the focus went to her estranged husband, 46-year-old John Paul Miller, a renowned pastor from Myrtle Beach, S.C.. He has maintained Mica died by suicide.\n\nNow, nearly two years after her death, federal prosecutors in South Carolina have secured an indictment against John Paul on cyberstalking charges, alleging he harassed Mica in various ways between November 2022 and her death.\n\nIn a Thursday, Dec. 18 press release announcing the indictment, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of South Carolina said John Paul \"sent unwanted and harassing communications\" to Mica during this time, allegedly posting a nude of her online without her consent.\n\nHe also allegedly had tracking devices on her vehicle and, on one occasion, contacted her over 50 times in a single day, authorities said in the statement. John Paul is further accused of damaging her tires and interfering with her finances and daily activities.\n\nAuthorities further allege John Paul lied to police about damaging Mica's tires, even though investigators found evidence that he had bought a tire deflation device and reached out to others about Mica's vehicle.\n\nMica's body was found by authorities after she called 911 and told a dispatcher she was about to take her own life.\n\nFollowing her death, John Paul faced heavy scrutiny. A petition created in the aftermath of her death claimed Mica \"lost her life due to no one helping her from being harassed and excessively stalked\" by John Paul, who she was \"desperately trying to get away from.\"\n\n\"She made report after report, no contact order was made and received no help, not even from law enforcement,\" the petition alleged.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? \n\nJohn Paul came under further scrutiny in February when an Indiana woman accused him of raping her when she was 15, and he was a 19-year-old youth church leader,\n\nJohn Paul's father Reginald Wayne Miller was also named in the lawsuit, which was reviewed by PEOPLE.\n\n“Behind their religious facade, John-Paul Miller and Reginald Wayne Miller engaged in sexual abuse and predatory conduct — often targeting minors,\" reads the complaint. \"They used their positions of power to manipulate and exploit vulnerable victims while concealing their actions from the public.\"\n\nJohn Paul faces a maximum of five years in prison for cyberstalking and two years for making false statements to federal investigators, according to the release from the U.S. Attorney's Office, District of South Carolina. He also faces a fine of up to $250,000 and is set to be arraigned on Jan. 12, 2026.\n\nPEOPLE reached out to his attorney who declined to comment on the case.\n\nIf you or someone you know has been a victim of sexual abuse, text \"STRENGTH\" to the Crisis Text Line at 741-741 to be connected to a certified crisis counselor.\n\nIf you are experiencing domestic violence, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233, or go to thehotline.org.

    "description": "Starting next year, Vanguard will offer a new retirement savings option for participants in its 401(k) plans that includes a fixed-income annuity.",
    "fullText": "One of the biggest challenges for retirees is figuring out how to pay themselves.\n\nFor years, it’s save, save, save, but when it comes time to pull money out of retirement accounts even people who have saved adequately for retirement tend to freeze.\n\nLearn more: Retirement planning — a step-by-step guide\n\nStarting next year, Vanguard has a solution: Through a collaboration with TIAA, it will offer a new retirement savings option for participants in its 401(k) plans. In simple terms, it’s an investment product modeled on target-date funds that comes with an annuity embedded into it.\n\n“Vanguard is aiming to make generating income from your target-date fund in retirement easier,” Jason Kephart, a senior principal at Morningstar, told me. “Including an annuity in a target-date fund will give people an easier opportunity to annuitize a part of their portfolio at retirement if that works with their retirement plan. They won’t have to deal with commissions or overly complex annuities.”\n\nTo annuitize essentially means to convert a lump sum portion of your employer retirement plan account into a guaranteed paycheck for a specified period or for the rest of your life.\n\nThe new offering could be a salve for a deep-seated retirement worry: running out of money if we live a long life, having high healthcare bills as we age, or seeing the markets drop and not bounce back quickly.\n\nParticipants will initially be enrolled into a Target Retirement Lifetime Income Trust, based on an expected retirement age of 65. While not technically called an account, the product is available in your employer’s 401(k) lineup of selections and will initially operate like a typical target-date fund.\n\nWith those funds, you choose the year you’d like to retire and buy a mutual fund with that year in its name (like Target 2044). The fund manager then divides your investment between stocks and bonds, typically made up of index funds, adjusting to a more conservative mix as the target date nears.\n\nIn Vanguard’s new product, at age 55, a portion of your fixed-income savings will be shifted to a TIAA secure income account, which is a type of fixed annuity (an insurance contract that provides a pension-like guarantee for growth and a lifetime income stream).\n\nLearn more: Fixed annuities vs. CDs: Which is better for your retirement savings?\n\nMuch like other defined-contribution plans, if you leave an employer and change jobs or are laid off and hold the Target Retirement Lifetime Income Trust, you typically will be able to leave your funds in the plan, roll them over to an IRA, or cash out, according to a Vanguard spokesperson. “Specific options for what participants can do will be defined by the plan sponsor,” he said.",

    "description": "The Safehouse in the Hills update has finally been released in GTA Online, and there are a few major highlights. Naturally, most players will gravitate to either buying a mansion or the fresh set of missions, including the new Michael mission. However, perhaps the most exciting piece of content in the update is the Mission Creator.\nThis feature is revolutionary for GTA Online, and also likely gives us a glimpse into what Rockstar Games has planned for Grand Theft Auto 6. But what exactly makes the Mission Creator so important, and how do you use it in GTA Online?",

    "description": "A “minor disruption” to beachgoers will happen as $72 million renourishment project is launched along Grand Strand.",
    "fullText": "Plumes of frothy seawater, a giant crablike contraption crawling across the strand, miles of pipe, and beeping earthmovers – it’s all coming to a beach near you.\n\nThe Grand Strand Beach Renourishment project is underway in North Myrtle Beach, and will continue south for 26 miles, adding two million cubic yards of sand to the shoreline.\n\nStaging of piping and heavy equipment could be seen at the end of Sea Mountain Highway in North Myrtle Beach on Wednesday afternoon, where beach walkers strolled, gazing out at new arrival of offshore dredges.\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Charleston vessel “Galveston Island” is setting up just off the coast to begin pumping a sand and seawater slurry onto the beach. They will start near the north end of Ocean Boulevard in North Myrtle Beach and work their way south in 1,000-foot sections of beach. Each section will take two or three days to complete depending on the weather.\n\nOfficials have said that they expect that renourishment will move through North Myrtle Beach by early 2026 and then continuing through Myrtle Beach and Surfside Beach before reaching Garden City around April 2026.\n\n“As with any large coastal project, the timeline remains subject to change due to weather conditions or equipment availability,” U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spokesperson Emily Stark said in a statement.\n\nThe $72 million project is entirely federally funded through emergency relief from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nPumping sand from the ocean depths and pushing it around on the beach is a messy process.\n\nPipes will be spewing slurry and bulldozers will be pushing it around complete with beeping back-up alarms – day and night.\n\nJimmy Gray, president of the Grand Strand Chamber of Commerce said the project may be a “minor disruption” to visiting beachgoers, but said that with almost 60 miles of public access to beaches, it shouldn’t be too hard to avoid the construction areas.\n\n“The disruption is certainly worth the long term investment in our number one asset which are beaches,” he said.\n\nThose sections of beach where construction is actually happening will be fenced off. The Corps said that beachgoers should avoid the fenced areas and any pipes that are on the beach. However, they said that there will be areas to safely cross, and that the rest of the beach will stay open as usual.\n\nA number of beachfront accesses will be temporarily closed as the project proceeds, but the closure should only last the few days as crews rebuild those sections of beachfront.\n\nResidents and visitors can track real-time progress through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ online tracker, which will provide updates on all project areas.\n\nFor detailed views of closures and the progress in North Myrtle Beach, visit the City’s Beach Renourishment tracker.\n\nRenourishing beaches is an ongoing effort to maintain one of South Carolina’s most important natural resources – the beach.\n\nSand dunes serve as a barrier to protect homes and local infrastructure from storm surge flooding. Wide easily accessible beaches drive tourism and add to the quality of life for residents, officials say.\n\nOn average, Grand Strand beaches require renourishment every seven to 10 years. But Hurricane Ian in September 2022 and Hurricane Debby in August 2024, are just two of several recent weather events that caused severe erosion to beaches and dunes along the Grand Strand.\n\nHorry County’s last renourishment was completed in 2019.\n\nA “hopper dredge” located offshore will get sand from pre-determined borrow areas to provide the beach with quality sand. Drag arms are lowered to the seabed where pumps suck up a sand-water mixture into the ship’s hopper. Once full, the hopper transfers the sand to a floating pipeline called a “pump out station.” Powerful pumps then push the sand and water slurry through a submerged pipeline before blasting it out onto the beach.\n\nThat giant crab-like structure that can be seen for miles down the beach? A U.S. Army Corps engineer says that it is a tool for surveying the surf zone.\n\nFinally, bulldozers spread the wet sand to create the profile of a wide sloping shoreline.\n\nThis process is done in 1,000-foot sections at a time continuing day and night over the course of two to three days, before shuffling down the beach and doing it all again.",

    "fullText": "on December 19, 2025 at 9:11AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nThe best Peak mods expand the creative spirit of developer Team Peak. The vanilla experience is already enticing as is, inviting you and up to three other friends to cruise through biomes filled with hazards and absurd obstacles as you climb toward a volcano's summit. The community, however, has been hard at work coming up with ideas of its own.\n\nWhile Peak's foundation provides no shortage of thrills and can keep you busy for a while, there are multiple mods that add interesting quality-of-life updates, from features that aren't supported officially to gadgets and gimmicks that fit the in-game world.\n\nOur list provides a jack-of-all-trades collection of Peak mods to get you started. It's worth mentioning that the game has only had a few months of lifespan, and Team Peak is constantly updating it with fixes and the occasional new biome or item. November, for example, saw the inclusion of the biome Roots, alongside an assortment of new items to play with. But if you'd like to expand the game on your own with the best Peak mods available, here are our top choices gathered in one place.\n\nIf you're looking for some help, we have guides about doing the scout cannon glitch, where to find the Scoutmaster, and all the items currently in the game.\n\nGhostPing is the immediate \"I didn't know how much I needed this\" selection of this list. As the title teases, this makes it so you can use the pin feature when you're a ghost. While you can still use voice proximity chat by default even if you're dead, there's always that moment when you want to manually pin at an obstacle, a poisonous flower, or a specific ledge. GhostPing removes that frustration entirely.\n\nOne of the best Peak mods out there, and for good reason. Peak Unlimited increases the multiplayer capacity in a lobby from the default four-player limit. Only the host needs to have this mod installed, which makes the process very easy. And in case you're wondering, yes, there will be marshmallows for the extra players when you're gathered at the campsite, and this also applies to late joiners.\n\nWhether you're not accustomed to first-person views due to motion sickness or you're looking for a different perspective, StableThirdPersonCamera adds a different option. All you have to do is press N, and you'll get to see your character in third person. And hey, you may have a lower chance of stepping on obstacles with this mode on.\n\nThe Peak experience tends to be self-contained within a lobby, but Everest presents an intriguing alternative. With this mod, when somebody dies, their location is saved to a server. As you play, your world is populated with skeletons of fellow fallen players, left as a mark. It's similar in nature to a Bloodstain in Dark Souls, albeit with the difference that you won't see an animation of how the player met their demise. You'll have to imagine it, and hopefully avoid recreating it.\n\nIf you're a music person, you're going to love sPEAKer. This mod adds a portable speaker that mimics its real-life counterpart to a painstaking degree. Rather than playing plain music for everyone in the background, it leverages spatial audio to make it part of the experience in an immersive way, adding to the chat proximity aspect of the game. The community has been uploading mixtapes to Thunderstore, but you can also go ahead and add your own music tracks.\n\nThe daily map rotation in Peak keeps the game fresh and enticing, but you might not always want to wait 24 hours to mix things up. As part of our best Peak mods list, MorePeak removes the daily wait timer entirely. Instead, every time you start a round, the game will load a new map. It could be a good method to keep in mind if you're trying to find the secret entrance in the Mesa biome.\n\nHere's a Peak mod that every multiplayer lobby host should have. MultiplayerPause does what it says on the tin, allowing the host to pause the game for everyone by merely pressing \"P\" on the keyboard. It's perfect for quick breaks, especially as the fog can start to rise quite fast depending on the difficulty.\n\nPiggyback is similar to MultiplayerPause, but it's not as disruptive. Basically, if one player has gone AFK or if they simply want a shortcut, this mod allows players to carry other characters even if they've not passed out. Only the players who intend to carry others need to have the mod installed, so it can happen by surprise if conditions are met.\n\nRagdoll is an important aspect of Peak, but the BetterRagdoll mod allows you to manually trigger it with just the press of a button (X on the keyboard). This makes it so you get a little push in the direction that you're moving, making it feel more dynamic, while also speeding up the process of getting back up.\n\nAs part of our selection of best Peak mods, this selection is a substantial addition, getting close to an overhaul of how the multiplayer experience works. PeakClassMod introduces eight classes with distinct abilities and playstyles, as well as disadvantages to balance them out. The classes include Scout, Medic, Tech-Priest, Mushroomancer, Great Épée, Rogue, Eddie, and Bill. It's definitely not a mod that takes itself seriously, which is fitting for Peak. If you've already accrued dozens of hours in the game and you've been wanting to try something new with your usual multiplayer group, this is the Peak mod for you.\n\nThe Roots update of Peak introduced a checkpoint feature via the Checkpoint Flag, making the climb to the summit a little easier. The way it works is that it creates a checkpoint wherever you plant it on the mountain. If you die, you'll respawn back at that point. The Peak Checkpoint Save, however, tackles a different necessity--if you or any of your teammates need to call it a day early, you can now save your progress at every campfire and continue later at the same location. Just make sure everybody playing has the mod installed to avoid issues.\n\nThe action of extending your hand to help a friend is at the heart of Peak, but Catch Players takes this further. This mod allows you to catch a falling player who is close enough to you to be saved, which will make it so you pull them towards you. It can be great for those moments where somebody offers to try and see if a climb is possible, with the reassurance that the people under them will be able to catch them if things go sour.\n\nWhile some players might prefer for navigation to be as close to the original intent as possible, this Peak mod adds a useful compass to the top of the screen. With it, you'll be able to see the location of friends, as well as suitcases. All markers on the compass show their distance from the player, and there are also up and down arrows to indicate the latitude of each object or friend. There are also options to tweak the compass, such as making it so that suitcases either show all the time or if they require a \"ping\" button press, to tailor to your liking.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorneys for President Donald Trump urged a federal judge on Friday to rule that Trump is entitled to presidential immunity from civil claims that he instigated a mob's attack on the U.S. Capitol to stop Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 election.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta didn't rule from the bench after hearing arguments from Trump attorneys and lawyers for Democratic members of Congress who sued the Republican president and allies over the Jan. 6. 2021, attack.\n\nTrump spoke to a crowd of his supporters at the “Stop the Steal” rally near the White House before the mob’s attack disrupted the joint session of Congress for certifying Democratic President Joe Biden’s electoral victory.\n\nTrump's attorneys argue that his conduct leading up to Jan. 6 and on the day of the riot is protected by presidential immunity because he was acting in his official capacity.\n\n“The entire point of immunity is to give the president clarity to speak in the moment as the commander-in-chief,” Trump attorney Joshua Halpern told the judge.\n\nThe lawmakers' lawyers argue Trump can't prove he was acting entirely in his official capacity rather than as an office-seeking private individual. And office-seekers aren't entitled to presidential immunity, they contend.\n\n“President Trump has the burden of proof here,” said plaintiffs' attorney Joseph Sellers. “We submit that he hasn't come anywhere close to satisfying that burden.”\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who chaired the House Homeland Security Committee, sued Trump, his personal attorney Rudolph Giuliani and members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers extremist groups over the Jan. 6 riot. Other Democratic members of Congress later joined the litigation.\n\nThe civil claims survived Trump's sweeping act of clemency on the first day of his second term, when he pardoned, commuted prison sentences and ordered the dismissal of all 1,500-plus criminal cases stemming from the Capitol siege.",

    "fullText": "On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Bleed Cubbie Blue is pleased to present a Cubs-centric look at baseball’s colorful past. Here’s a handy Cubs timeline, to help you follow the various narrative paths.\n\n“Maybe I called it wrong, but it’s official.” — Tom Connolly, HoF Umpire.\n\nToday we feature financial skullduggery and other such fare, just the thing for a holiday week. Happy Birthday to Geoff Zahn* and other former Cubs.\n\n“… to all mankind, America’s wish for peace on Earth and goodwill to men everywhere.”\n\n1914 – Washington manager Clark Griffith meets with Walter Johnson in Kansas City and convinces the star to re-sign for $12,500, considerably less than his recent contract with the Chifeds, with the assurance that Griffith would convince the Washington management to spring for a bigger contract later. Washington will later sign Johnson to $16,000 a year for five years. Griffith gets $6,000 from Charles Comiskey to allow Johnson to repay his Chifed signing bonus. (2)\n\n1957 – In a continuing family squabble, Charles Comiskey, Jr. denies his sister, Mrs. Dorothy Comiskey Rigney’s, allegation that he used the “rule or ruin” tactic to gain control of the club. (2)\n\n1974 – The race to sign newly-minted free agent Catfish Hunter begins in the law offices of Cherry, Cherry & Flythe in Ahoskie, North Carolina. Yankee and Red Sox representatives are the first arrivals. (2)\n\n1986 – After finding no other clubs interested in signing him, free agent pitcher and 20-game winner Jack Morris agrees to salary arbitration with the Tigers while at the same time accusing the major league owners of collusion against free agents. Morris had offered to sign a one-year contract, with salary to be determined by an arbitrator, with either the Yankees, Angels, Twins or Phillies, but was turned down by all four. (1,2)\n\n1991 – Former minor league umpire Pam Postema files a sex discrimination suit against the National and American leagues, the Triple-A Alliance, and the Baseball Office for Umpire Development. (2)\n\n2001 – Free agent Moises Alou (.331, 27, 108) signs a $27 million, three-year deal with the Cubs. The former Astro All-Star’s presence in the Chicago line-up, along with Fred McGriff and Sammy Sosa, will give the team a fearsome 3-4-5 threesome. The Cubs also trade OF Michael Tucker to the Royals in exchange for a player to be named (who turned out to he minor leaguer Shawn Sonnier). (2)\n\nCubs Birthdays: Tony Taylor, Rob Gardner, Geoff Zahn*, Rafael Soriano, Taylor Gushue.

    "description": "The College Football Playoff (CFP) kicks off tonight with Oklahoma vs Alabama! Here’s how you can watch each matchup, including tonight’s SEC rematch:",
    "fullText": "The College Football Playoffs are finally underway this weekend, as some of the top teams in the country do battle for a shot for a national title. With three teams in the playoff, the Big Ten is well represented, but two of those three teams sit on a bye week as the top two programs in the country. One, the Oregon Ducks, play on Saturday against James Madison.\n\nHere’s how you can watch that game and the other four that take place this weekend.\n\nWeather: 49 degrees, partly cloudy\n\nThis game will wrap up the first-round slate, and Vegas really likes a landslide victory for the Ducks.\n\nBob Chesney, JMU’s head coach, is prepping to leave after this run to coach UCLA and has a foot out of the door already. While the Dukes cruised through Sun Belt play to an 11-1 record, they lost at Louisville, their only Power 4 opponent, by two touchdowns back in Week 2. Many are counting them out of this game, but they boasted both a top-10 offense and defense in the country.\n\nOregon should win this game, but if it sneaks back to 21.5 points again like it has a few times over the last few days, I’ll likely take the Dukes and the points.\n\nWeather: 65 degrees, partly cloudy\n\nAnother playoff game, another two programs who are playing with head coaching chaos. Lane Kiffin’s ugly exit with Ole Miss has already happened, while Tulane’s Jon Sumrall will head to Florida once this CFP run is over.\n\nThe Green Wave lost two games this season, including a blowout at Ole Miss in Week 4. This one goes similarly, even without Kiffin, as the Rebels are clearly the much better team.\n\nThe play: Ole Miss -17.5 (-110)\n\nWeather: 67 degrees, partly cloudy\n\nMike Elko’s Aggies were perfect through their first 11 games, but a loss at Texas in the final game of the season has brought up some questions for this team.\n\nThere is a common opponent for these two teams — Notre Dame, a team considered snubbed despite a 10-2 record. Both squads won late over the Irish by a field goal or less. Despite missing the ACC Championship, Miami was playing its best football in the final four weeks. If I was playing a side, it would likely be the Hurricanes. I think this is the best game of the weekend and I expect a shootout despite the total shrinking from 52.5 at open to 48.5. Give me the over.\n\nThe first game of the CFP is a rematch, as Oklahoma went to Tuscaloosa and beat Alabama, 23-20, earlier this season. Oklahoma was without star edge R Mason Thomas in that game, and quarterback John Mateer was battling an injury. This time around, there are some rumblings that Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson may not be fully healthy. It’s going to be a fascinating game, but I think the Crimson Tide are the better team and that they win this game.\n\nOverall record: 31-32 (-2.18 units)",

    "title": "Steelers vs. Lions bold prediction: Jared Goff’s jersey stays clean",
    "description": "Our bold prediction for Steelers vs. Lions? Detroit holds off the Steelers' pass rush to keep Jared Goff upright.",
    "fullText": "Even when I try to go simple with my bold prediction, it still doesn’t come true. Last week’s prediction was a big ask, despite it being straightforward. This week’s bold prediction might be too much to ask for in this game, but as much as the Detroit Lions are in must-win mode, so am I.\n\nIn Week 16, the Lions have their home season finale against the Pittsburgh Steelers. If you’ve been watching football for a long time, you know the Steelers are known for having a strong defense. While the defense as a whole this season hasn’t been up to par, one part where they dominate is in their pass rush. I got a feeling that, despite being a problem for other teams, the Lions will hold off the Steelers’ pass rush.\n\nDespite facing the most sacks he’s ever faced in his career in Detroit, I believe Lions quarterback Jared Goff will avoid Steelers defenders on Sunday afternoon. While the standard of the Lions’ offensive line hasn’t been up to par, with a rookie right guard and second-year left guard for most of the year, alongside most of the line dealing with injuries, this unit is still respectable. First, they’ve kept Goff upright in four games this season.\n\nFull disclosure, three of those games have been against bottom-half defenses (Baltimore Ravens, Chicago Bears, Washington Commanders). In its toughest matchup against the Cleveland Browns, though, (third in the NFL in sacks with 47), they held off EDGE Myles Garrett from adding any more sacks to his possibly record-breaking season. What also helped the Lions in three of those games (excluding Washington) was that they had all five starters alongside the line.\n\nStarting left guard Christian Mahogany has been on IR since suffering a lower leg injury in Week 9, leaving Detroit to shuffle around his replacement. It was originally Kayode Awosika, until he also suffered an injury that brought back the infamous guard rotation between Trystan Colon and rookie Miles Frazier. While the two split snaps in the previous two games, Colon appeared to have won the job by getting more snaps against the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nDespite playing more, Colon struggled against the Rams, getting a 43.3 run block grade and 31.2 pass blocking grade. Frazier outperformed him, getting a 55.3 run block grade and a 56.9 pass blocking grade. The good news for the offensive line is that Mahogany hoped to return against either the Rams or the Steelers, and after missing the Rams game, that leaves this week as his next return date. If Mahogany can return, this offensive line can receive a massive boost on the left side, where Detroit has struggled in his absence. If Mahogany needs another week to return, I wouldn’t be shocked if Frazier gets the nod over Colon.\n\nNow, while the Lions’ offensive line has had some success and struggles, they’re matched up against the Steelers defense that is tied for fifth in the league for sacks with 40. Leading that front is former NFL Defensive Player of the Year in linebacker T.J. Watt, as he has a team-high seven sacks. While Watt hasn’t had this few sacks since 2022 when he had five and a half, this time he’s got more help alongside the defensive front.\n\nLinebackers Nick Herbig and Alex Highsmith are right behind Watt in sacks with six and a half each. They’re also getting help on the interior from defensive tackles Keeanu Benton (4.5 sacks) and veteran Cameron Heyward (2.5 sacks). PFF has the pass rush ranked third in the NFL at 83.1 and it’s understandable why.\n\nThe thing that favors Detroit in this matchup is that Watt and Herbig could miss the game on Sunday. Watt suffered a partially collapsed lung in the middle of last week, forcing him to miss Week 15, while Herbig suffered a hamstring injury in the game. At the time of writing, the status of the players is unknown for Sunday, but both are trending toward missing the game. If Watt and Herbig are gone, there goes 13.5 of the 40 sacks on the defense. Losing two of the top three pass rushers on the team forces others on the Steelers defense to step up, but if Detroit can put more resources on the reinforcements, they might not see the same success they had previously.\n\nIt’s not easy stopping this Steelers defensive line either, as only two times this season have they been held without a sack, both losses to the Green Bay Packers and Buffalo Bills. If the Steelers shuffle around its defensive front going up against a Lions offensive line that could see its starting left guard return, the chemistry Detroit will have will outdo the Steelers. If Herbig and/or Watt play on Sunday, the Lions’ game plan should be similar to what it was against the Browns: get the ball out quickly so the defensive pressure can’t have time to get to Goff.\n\nIf the Lions can get Mahogany back at left guard and if Watt and/or Herbig miss the game, this bold prediction should come true. If Frazier has to start and Watt and Herbig do play, I think it’s still something that can happen, but the Lions must change how they attack this Steelers defense.",

    "fullText": "The Browns lost their third straight game last Sunday and 11th overall on the season, in a dismal 31-3 beatdown at the hands of the Chicago Bears. It was their worst defeat of the year in terms of point differential and a big step back offensively after a promising 29-point performance against the Tennessee Titans in Week 14, albeit in another losing effort.\n\nIt was particularly a step back for rookie signal-caller Shedeur Sanders, who completed just a shade over 50% of his throws with three interceptions and a quarterback rating of 30.3. Only one of the Browns’ 12 offensive drives resulted in points, they rushed for just 50 total yards and converted nine first downs.\n\nWith the season completely lost, the last few games are all about youth development to build some momentum heading into next year. This week’s matchup against the Buffalo Bills is a big test. Cleveland’s defense, who have now allowed 31 points in back-to-back weeks, will have their hands full against a red-hot Josh Allen and James Cook-led Bills’ offense.\n\nWhere the Browns could find some success is on the ground, as the Bills’ run defense has been vulnerable this season. Cleveland’s rushing attack has struggled mightily over the last two weeks, though. Getting Quinshon Judkins going behind the offensive line will be key for the Browns to make a competitive game out of this as double-digit underdogs on the road.\n\nThe Bengals suffered a putrid defeat at home last Sunday, being shut out by the Baltimore Ravens 24-0. In doing so, the Bengals were officially eliminated from postseason contention — although their slim chances were a longshot anyways. Still, to go down in flames offensively like they did was disappointing, to say the least.\n\nCincinnati’s offense, which had scored 30+ points in consecutive games since Joe Burrow returned, was lifeless for most of the game. Two interceptions by Burrow, two failed fourth down conversion attempts, and three punts encapsulated all of the Bengals’ full offensive drives of the day.\n\nThe Bengals may have no playoff hopes to play for anymore, but Burrow and company will surely look to bounce back from a zero-point performance this coming Sunday. They should have a decent chance to do so against the Miami Dolphins, even on the road. The Dolphins are also now eliminated from the playoffs and benched quarterback Tua Tagovoila, meaning the Bengals will face former seventh-round pick Quinn Ewers.\n\nThat’s a favorable recipe for the Bengals’ defense, who did allow only 17 points last week. Miami’s rushing attack is still dangerous, and they’ll surely want to ground-and-pound all game, to aid their young quarterback and keep the ball away from Burrow. The potential return of Tee Higgins at wide receiver could give the team a little jolt on offense.\n\nSpeaking of the Dolphins, they were eliminated at the hands of the Pittsburgh Steelers last week. The Steelers earned their second straight victory by way of a 28-15 comfortable win at home on Sunday night. Pittsburgh’s defense had allowed just three points before the fourth quarter and less than 300 total yards for the game.\n\nThe Steelers found more rhythm on the ground offensively, totaling 135 yards with two rushing two touchdowns. Kenneth Gainwell’s role continues to grow as he rushed for a team-high 80 yards on 13 carries, with seven catches for 46 more yards as a pass-catcher. Aaron Rodgers spread the ball around to eight different receivers and completed 23-of-27 passes with two touchdowns and 224 passing yards.\n\nRodgers has looked more spry over the past two games, which is a welcome late-season development. The Steelers face a big test this Sunday as they seek a third straight win. They’ll have to topple the Detroit Lions on the road, who are also in a must-win situation for their playoff chances in the NFC. The Lions are also 8-6 but have one of the top-ranked offenses in the league.\n\nWith no T.J. Watt and Nick Herbig on the edge, the Steelers’ defense will be challenged. Manufacturing pressure on Jared Goff will be key to disrupting Detroit’s offense and creating turnovers. On the other side of the ball, the Steelers should be able to move the ball and score against a Lions’ defense that has allowed 27+ points in each of the past four games.\n\nThe aforementioned Ravens cruised to their most convincing win of the season in Cincinnati last week, pitching a rare shutout defensively. The Ravens’ defense forced 12 stops on third down, had a season-high four sacks and allowed only 4.2 yards per play. Despite being on the field for 39+ minutes and 71 snaps, the Ravens managed to give up no points — highlighted by an 84-yard interception return for a touchdown late in the fourth quarter.\n\nOn the other side of the ball, Lamar Jackson attempted a career-low 12 pass attempts but threw two touchdowns and averaged 12.5 yards per throw. The Ravens ran roughshod on the Bengals’ defense, totaling 189 yards on just 24 carries (7.9 yards per carry). With their offensive inconsistencies and unreliable pass protection in recent weeks, that’s the recipe for success for the team moving forward.\n\nThe next obstacle in their way of getting over .500 is an 11-win New England Patriots team, who travel to Baltimore for a primetime game this Sunday night. The Patriots had won 10 straight games before losing to the Bills last week, after they squandered a 21-0 lead at home. The Ravens are favored by 2.5 points but face a tall task against a well-rounded, well-coached Patriots team.\n\nNew England’s defense is one of the best in the NFL against the run this season, so whether the Ravens can find success again on the ground will be a deciding factor in this matchup. Defensively, limiting explosive plays and getting pressure on Drake Maye in the pocket will be key developments.",

The Reds are still fifth in goals but average in goals allowed, though their fifth-best xGA suggest a little misfortune here. While these sides are nearly equal in goal difference, no one would believe their quality is anything close, even with Liverpool’s slump.\n\nMohamed Salah or not, expect the visitors to find the back of the net — likely on numerous occasions. Multiple goals have been scored in three of their last four contents and this is exactly the sort of side that will punish defensive mistakes. Maybe it ends up not quite as horrific as some of the battles last season, but Hugo Ekitike, Alexander Isak, and the rest of the attackers will be looking for blood on Saturday.\n\nDoes the approach revert? Accordingly, the logical decision after the weekend and now facing a team as scary as Liverpool would be for Frank to go way more defensive, which starts in central midfield. Archie Gray has been solid overall and should not be overly penalized for one mistake, but this is one of the few times it makes sense to get hyper conservative and secure at these spots.\n\nAdditionally, this feels like another chance for the return of the back three. Against Arsenal, the results were…less than desirable, but there clearly needs to be more stability in defense and this would be one way to achieve it. Frank has also not shied away from trying out different formations, and with his support quickly dissipating, we are reaching kitchen sink time.\n\nWhere is the hope? Optimistically thinking, maybe the week-long break between Forest and Liverpool, then again between Liverpool and Palace, is exactly what this club (and manager) needs. It has been essentially two matches a week the whole season long, and it certainly takes time for the new regime to get its structure into place, especially with so many changes compared to the previous managerial staff.\n\nHowever, it could get dark very quickly. A loss to Liverpool is clearly the expected outcome, and a loss away to Palace would be zero surprise. That then brings Frank and Spurs to Brentford, where the atmosphere is going to be extremely anxiety-inducing. With Tottenham potentially dead in the league at that point, one has to wonder if recovery is even an option.",

    "title": "Attention Bayern Munich fans, Joshua Kimmich just picked the worst Bundesliga XI you’ll ever see",
    "description": "FC Bayern fans need to SEE this",
    "fullText": "Joshua Kimmich is a pretty smart guy. During his long career at Bayern Munich he has played with some of the absolute greats of the game, players who will make many a fan’s “Greatest of All Time” lists. So, who does Kimmich himself rate as his best possible Bundesliga XI?\n\nWell, in a collaboration between 433 and the Bundesliga, Kimmich was asked to pick an Ultimate Bundesliga XI. His choices are… headscratchers, to say the least.\n\nIn case you can’t see the tweet (or refuse to use Musk’s terrible platform), here is who he picked:\n\nDefense — Philipp Lahm, Dayot Upamecano, Franz Beckenbauer, David Alaba\n\nMidfield — Toni Kroos, Xabi Alonso, Florian Wirtz\n\nAttack — Kingsley Coman, Jamal Musiala, Franck Ribéry\n\nYeah, that selection is… not great. Let’s go down the list step by step, okay?\n\nKimmich got this one spot on. Manuel Neuer is the greatest keeper of all time and deserves to be in any Bundesliga XI.\n\nAgain, spot on. Philipp Lahm is the GOAT.\n\nDavid Alaba is a good pick. Kimmich played with him for several years so familiarity definitely factors into this choice. Other candidates could have included current FC Bayern teammate Alphonso Davies, or Bayern Munich legend Paul Breitner .\n\nNo one is going to argue against Franz Beckenbauer. He is inarguably the greatest ever defender to play the game and one of the best players in the world of his era. The same cannot be said for Dayot Upamecano. To be fair, the Frenchman is a key part of this current Bayern Munich team and is a well-rounded, modern center-back. However, he faces stiff competition from other league stalwarts, like Mats Hummels for example (who also played with Kimmich at Bayern).\n\nThis seems like a choice based purely on familiarity, nothing more.\n\nToni Kroos? Fair. He may have reached the peak of his prowess at Real Madrid, but he had a very successful career at Bayern Munich as well. Xabi Alonso is also a fair pick, though he had declined by the time he played in the Bundesliga. Florian Wirtz, however, is a travesty. How do you pick 22-year-old who had a couple of great seasons in an “Ultimate” XI?\n\nThe Bundesliga had some truly amazing midfielders in the past, many of whom Josh has personally played with. From the older generation, Lothar Matthäus comes to mind, while Thiago Alcantara and Bastian Schweinsteiger deserve a shout from more recent times. If attacking midfielders are included, then Thomas Müller had ten times the career Wirtz did, and so did Kevin De Bruyne. Midfield is where Kimmich’s XI goes off the rails.\n\nFranck Ribéry? Yes, solid pick. No arguments. Everyone else — are you kidding me? Kingsley Coman over Arjen Robben? JAMAL MUSIALA AT STRIKER? Ahead of Gerd Müller, Robert Lewandowski, and Harry Kane — the latter two being actual teammates Kimmich has played with. Like come on, how do you pick an XI without a striker? It feels like Kimmich just picked names out of a hat, or chose players he had a personal connection to. Fair, that’s his prerogative — is is HIS Ultimate XI after all, but the team he chose is truly pitiful and would struggle to beat the current Bayern Munich in a hypothetical game.\n\nIf you think you can make a better “Ultimate XI” than Kimmich, post yours in the comments!\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…",

    "fullText": "This 2025 NFL season hasn’t been what was expected from the Arizona Cardinals. In a division full of some of the league’s best ballclubs, the Cardinals aren’t one of them.\n\nBut there are silver linings. And with some, you don’t have to look too hard. Arizona tight end Trey McBride might be this year’s brightest star on the roster. He has already set one league record several weeks ago, and now this past weekend, he set two more.\n\nIn the Cardinals’ 40-20 loss to the Houston Texans this past Sunday, McBride had 12 receptions for 134 yards and scored two touchdowns to lead all pass catchers.\n\nAmong the flow of the game, McBride set two records: 1) “Most consecutive games by a tight end with five or more catches,” and 2) “First tight end in NFL history to have 100 catches or \n\nWith the first record, McBride now has 16 consecutive games, which broke the record of 15 held by Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs in 2018.\n\nLast year, McBride caught 111 passes for 1,146 yards. He now has 105 passes for 1,071 this season with three games remaining.\n\nMcBride can now set his sights on the NFL record for “Most receptions by a tight end in a single season.” The record is 116 catches set by former Cardinal Zack Ertz in 2018 while he was playing for the Philadelphia Eagles. Needing an even dozen in three games shouldn’t be an issue for McBride.\n\nHe is currently ranked #1 in receptions in the league, #2 in targets, #3 in touchdowns, #4 in first down conversions, #6 in total yards gained, and #25 in pass completions of 20+ yards.\n\nTwo weeks ago, McBride broke the NFL record for the “Most receptions by a tight end in his first four seasons in the league.” The old record was set by tight end Jimmy Graham, who had 3,863 yards on 301 receptions. Against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 13, McBride led all receivers with eight catches for 82 yards and a touchdown, and finished with 309 career receptions. He has since added to that total.",

    "fullText": "Buford (GA) crowned 2025 Sporting News high school football national champions originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Buford [GA] Wolves are The Sporting News High School Football National Champions for the 2025 season.\n\nThe Wolves debuted at No. 12 in the preseason edition of The Sporting News High School Football Top 25, and steadily worked their way up to the top position by defeating all comers and finishing 15-0. That included a 28-21 win over the No. 3/SN No. 2 Carrollton [GA] Trojans in Georgia's GHSA Class 6A state championship game.\n\nIn a year defined by upsets with national championship contenders dropping almost every week, Buford managed to escape 2025's war of attrition unscathed and did so in the only state with three top-10 teams.\n\nHere's a closer look at Buford's incredible season in addition to a look into how we ultimately determined our national champion.\n\nDavid McGregor/Buford High School Football\n\nThere is no official system that exists to determine high school football's national champion.\n\nNo playoff committee bunkered in a hotel conference room. No defined process that outlines the criteria to determine which teams should be eligible. No consensus algorithm or computer rating. There isn't even a single major poll like the AP Poll or a Coaches Poll that exists to determine high school football's national champion.\n\nInstead, high school football's national champion is chosen by individual organizations that issue rankings during the season and crown their own champions at the conclusion of the season.\n\nA beautifully imperfect balancing act of art and science.\n\nFrom start to finish, five teams held the top spot in our weekly rankings: Mater Dei (CA), Bishop Gorman (NV), St. John Bosco (CA), IMG Academy (FL) and Buford (GA).\n\nNo. 1 Mater Dei until losing to Centennial (CA)\n\nNo. 1 Bishop Gorman for one week until losing to Mater Dei\n\nNo. 1 St. John Bosco for until losing to Mater Dei\n\nNo. 1 IMG until Buford advanced to Georgia 6A semis\n\nAs previous No. 1 teams lost along with perennial heavyweights in Texas falling (all four teams in the two Texas 6A title games have at least one loss) and a 3-loss team winning California (Carson Palmer's Santa Margarita, who is playing as well as anyone!), our final choice whittled down to Buford, IMG Academy and St. Frances.\n\nIt's worth noting that IMG Academy and St. Frances were originally scheduled to play in mid-December before that game ultimately fell through due to scheduling concerns. While IMG finished 9-0 and St. Frances (9-1) comfortably handled Utah powerhouse Corner Canyon in a late addition to the schedule (and billed by some as a national title game), neither could ultimately match Buford's wire-to-wire body of work.\n\nHowever, both IMG Academy and St. Frances could still stake claim to a national title. Along with The Sporting News High School Football Top 25, seven other major selectors are used here weekly to compile The Sporting News Composite Rankings – an attempt to determine a consensus No. 1 and, eventually, a consensus national champion.\n\nThe final edition of those composite rankings will be issued next week after all the final rankings have been released. Buford was No. 1 headed into Tuesday night's contest, but the margin was close, and we won't know if they are the consensus national champions until all those final rankings are released and compiled.\n\nDavid McGregor/Buford High School Football\n\nHere's a full look at Buford's run to the title along with how the Wolves progressed week-by-week in our national poll.\n\nvs. No. 3/SN No. 2 Carrollton Trojans\n\nEntering the season ranked No. 12 in SN's preseason Top 25, Buford immediately made noise, knocking off the defending Class 5A champion and SN No. 14 Milton [GA] Eagles, 20-13, on August 14. The Wolves followed that up with a one-sided 42-14 win over the eventual Class 4A runner-up Benedictine [Savannah, GA] Cadets on August 22 before taking an early bye week.\n\nThree games. Three signature wins. Turns out Buford was just getting warmed up.\n\nPrior to their October 17 game against Central Gwinnett [Lawrenceville, GA], the Wolves moved up to No. 6, and they won by their biggest margin of the season in a 75-0 rout of the Black Knights.\n\nIt was at this point Buford arrived as a serious threat to win the national title as the Wolves appeared on a postseason collision course with fellow Georgia powerhouse, Grayson.\n\nBuford maintained No. 6 position for five weeks, including a bye week before the start of the playoffs where the Wolves earned their second shutout of the year in a 45-0 whitewashing of the Richmond Hill [Suwanee, GA] Wildcats.\n\nBuford then moved up to No. 5 for two weeks, but their second win of the season over the Douglas County [Douglasville, GA] Tigers earned them a promotion to No. 2.\n\nThey held that spot for just one week before taking over the top position from the IMG Academy [Bradenton, FL] Ascenders. Carrollton's dominant upset of Grayson propelled it up the rankings, leading to a No. 1 vs No. 2 national showdown for the Georgia 6A state title.\n\nGiven other dominos namely in Texas and California, that ultimately served as SN's national championship game.\n\nGeorgia 2025 playoff brackets (6A/5A/4A)\n\nFlorida 2025 playoff brackets (7A/6A/5A/4A)\n\nLouisiana 2025 playoff brackets (Division I/II)\n\nTexas 2025 playoff brackets (6A/5A/4A)\n\nBuford's path to the 2025 national championship ran through Valdosta, Georgia, on December 5 – a fitting path considering Valdosta High School's national title history.\n\nThe Wildcats are credited with six national titles, dating back to 1962. That includes two USA Today Super 25 national titles in 1984 and 1986.\n\nThe most recent national title for a team in the Peach State prior to this season came via the Colquitt County [Norman Park, GA] Packers who won the 2015 national championship from High School Football America. The Calhoun [GA] Yellow Jackets were credited with a 2011 small school national championship by MaxPreps Small Schools rankings – the first national title by a Georgia school since the Parkview [Lilburn, GA] Panthers claimed the 2002 title courtesy of USA High School Football.\n\nOther Georgia schools with national championships in football include the Warner Robins [GA] Demons (1976 and 1981), LaGrange [GA] Grangers (1991), and Thomasville [GA] Bulldogs.",

    "fullText": "The Cowboys have received devastating injury news on cornerback Daron Bland.\n\nFRISCO — Cowboys officials are trying to determine if starting cornerback DaRon Bland needs surgery on his left foot, a person with knowledge of his health told The Dallas Morning News.\n\nIt isn’t known how Bland suffered the injury, but he missed the second and third games of the season with a foot issue.\n\nBland underwent surgery on his left foot last season, which caused him to miss the first ten games. Bland returned and played in seven games.\n\nThis season, Bland played in 12 games, recording one interception and six pass breakups.\n\nMatt Eberflus will no longer be on the sideline during games.\n\nFRISCO, Texas – After a conversation with head coach Brian Schottenheimer, Cowboys defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus is moving from the sideline to the coaching booth to call plays for Dallas’ defense.\n\nEberflus said on Thursday that it was not the first time he and Schottenheimer had discussed the possibility, but they now believe it’s best for the Cowboys heading into their final three games of the 2025 season.\n\n“I think that’s a really good thing,” Eberflus said. “[Schottenheimer] and I talked it through, and I’ve done it before. It’s really a chance for me to get good perspective, get good information, see the game develop in terms of information given to me on the sidelines… it’s been a while, but it’s going to be a good adjustment.”\n\nThe first time Eberflus was in the booth in the NFL was his first season, when he served as the Cleveland Browns’ linebackers coach from 2009-2010. In recent years as defensive coordinator for the Indianapolis Colts and then head coach for the Chicago Bears, Eberflus has been on the field and has also served as the play caller.\n\nWith Eberflus calling plays upstairs, that means those on the sidelines need to be able to deliver adjustments, messages or whatever else Eberflus observes from upstairs. While there’ll be communication from Eberflus to all his position coaches, defensive line coach Aaron Whitecotton will be the one tasked with messages for the defense as a whole.\n\nThe Cowboys injury list has been a long one for most of the season.\n\nOn Thursday, the Dallas Cowboys practiced again where it’s business as usual with a game against the Los Angeles Chargers coming up. Here’s where the Cowboys are regarding injuries.\n\nThe Cowboys’ secondary is banged up once again this week, as many of their defensive backs are on the injury report. DaRon Bland (foot) did not practice for a second consecutive day. Bland has been hampered by a foot injury sporadically this season, so far this week he’s not quite healthy. Aside from Bland, many of his secondary counterparts were limited on Thursday again. Caelen Carson (shoulder/hamstring), Trevon Diggs (knee), Josh Butler (knee), Shavon Revel (knee). In Diggs’ case, he believes that he feels well enough to play, but there are some obstacles he needs to clear with the team before returning to the field.\n\nThe George Pickens conversations over the last two weeks have gotten silly. He will (and should) be here for the foreseeable future.\n\nHow much, if anything, will Pickens’ disappearance the last couple of weeks when the season was on the line cost him in terms of the Cowboys’ willingness to make a long-term deal? — Michael S.\n\nNot much at all. They understand that a big part of it is the extra attention coming his way from opposing defenses. They also know how much more explosive the offense is with Pickens and CeeDee Lamb on the field together. If I had to predict today, Pickens will end up getting the franchise tag. He obviously won’t like that idea. I just have my doubts about Jerry Jones’ being able to get a deal done with David Mulugheta after how ugly things got with Micah Parsons. Jones could prove me wrong, but the tag is more likely at this point. Either way, I don’t see a scenario where Pickens is playing anywhere but Dallas next season.\n\nIt is (unfortunately) mock draft season for the Cowboys again.\n\n16. Dallas Cowboys (6-7-1), Keldric Faulk, edge, Auburn\n\nThis season, Faulk has taken a step back in production, but there is no denying he is an explosive pass rusher who would immediately improve the Cowboys’ attack on the edge.\n\n“Dallas has the NFL’s second-worst scoring defense, ranking fourth-worst in yards allowed. The Cowboys also have the league’s worst pass defense, but they have pieces at corner and have played much of the season without the injured Trevon Diggs,” Flick wrote. “So the pass rush that’s tied for ninth-worst with 29 sacks is a better place to start. The 6-foot-6, 285-pound Faulk, a team captain at Auburn, brings size, intelligence, and a tremendous athletic profile to the table.”\n\nLast season, Faulk totaled 45 tackles, 11 tackles for a loss, 7 sacks, and a forced fumble. This season, he totaled 29 tackles, five tackles for a loss, and two sacks.\n\nMost fans are probably tired of this being the team’s biggest accomplishment.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys retained their status as the world’s most valuable sports team, according to the list published by Forbes on Thursday that ​was dominated by National Football League clubs.\n\nThe NFL’s Cowboys, who unseated Spanish football club Real Madrid ‌for top spot on the list in 2016, ‌were valued at $13 billion, a 29% jump compared to last year, Forbes said.\n\nThe National Basketball Association’s Golden State Warriors ($11 billion), the NFL’s Los Angeles ⁠Rams($10.5 billion) and New York Giants ($10.1 billion), and the NBA’s ‌Los Angeles Lakers ($10 billion) rounded out the top five.\n\nForbes ​said 30 of the NFL’s 32 teams were on its top-50 list, which also included 12 NBA clubs and two each from Major League Baseball, Formula 1, LaLiga and the ‌Premier League.\n\nThe Cowboys have a big decision to make on Kenny Clark coming up this offseason.\n\nThis means the 2026 offseason will see “cap casualties,” as they will need extra money to operate in free agency, the trade market, and with upcoming extensions.\n\nSpecifically, there is one high-quality and new-to-Dallas player that may fall victim to the Cowboys’ financial constraints. Here, we’ll talk about him and the money it would save by releasing him in 2026.\n\nKenny Clark: In-And-Out Of Dallas Thanks To Salary Cap Issues\n\nSavings (via Over The Cap): $21.5 Million If Released\n\nCap Penalty/Dead Money (via Over The Cap): $0 If Released\n\nThat’s right, the man in question is the player Dallas received from Green Bay this summer in exchange for the All-Pro Parsons.\n\nKenny Clark, 30, joined the Cowboys, alongside two first-round picks, and has played well in a reformed interior defensive line that now includes both Quinnen Williams and Osa Odighizuwa. Due to the financial details above, the trio may last one season.",

    "description": "Free agent John Means has suffered another serious injury that will keep him out of commission for a while.",
    "fullText": "It’s time for your daily Orioles pitching update:\n\nThe Orioles have not signed any pitchers yet.\n\nThis has been your daily Orioles pitching update.\n\nMeanwhile, there’s some rotten news about a former Orioles All-Star pitcher, John Means. The lefty posted on Instagram that he tore his Achilles earlier this week, just as he was about to sign with a team, and had to undergo surgery. He’ll presumably be sidelined for most if not all of 2026.\n\nIt’s the latest awful twist of fate for Means, whose once-promising career continues to be ravaged by injuries. Means was an out-of-nowhere success story for the O’s in 2019, finishing as AL Rookie of the Year runner-up after transforming from a fringe prospect into the anchor of the Orioles’ rotation. He brought O’s fans plenty of fond memories, most notably in 2021 when he threw a no-hitter in Seattle, the Birds’ first solo no-no in 52 years. On some otherwise lousy Orioles teams, fans could always look forward to watching Means work his stuff every five days.\n\nBut just as the Orioles’ fortunes improved, Means’s went the other direction. In 2022, the Orioles’ first winning season in six years, Means made just two starts before undergoing Tommy John surgery. He didn’t return until the very end of 2023, and just when he was on track to make the Orioles’ playoff roster, he missed the Division Series with elbow soreness. He then made only four starts in 2024 before sadly having to get a second TJ surgery. He latched on with Cleveland in 2025 and completed his rehab by September, but the Guardians opted not to include him on their postseason roster and declined his option.\n\nAnd now, just as Means was ready to return with a new club — in his words, “I was finally enjoying my first healthy offseason in four years and felt better than ever” — another freak injury has taken him out of commission. I don’t know what Means did to anger the baseball gods, but the poor guy has had one misfortune after another piled on top of him. It’s sad to think that a guy who seemed like he’d be a premier pitcher for years might never throw another pitch, but it’s a real possibility at this point.\n\nGet well soon, John, and here’s hoping we haven’t seen the last of you on a major league mound. All of Birdland will be rooting for you.\n\nCould Coby Mayo learn to play outfield for Orioles? | MAILBAG – BaltimoreBaseball.com\n\nRich Dubroff is skeptical that Mayo can learn to play the outfield. I will say there’s probably a reason that the O’s haven’t tried to play him there for even a single minor league inning.\n\nWho will lead off for O’s next year? Assessing the options – MLB.com\n\nLet me offer a candidate who’s not listed in this article: Dylan Beavers.\n\nSuárez return raises more relief questions, more mailbag leftovers for breakfast – School of Roch\n\nAlbert Suárez wasn’t exactly who I was expecting the Orioles’ next free agent bullpen signing to be, but sure, throw him into the mix and see what happens.\n\nDo Orioles have best lineup in MLB with Pete Alonso? Mike Elias thinks so. – The Baltimore Sun\n\nI feel like people were saying the same thing about the Orioles’ lineup before the 2025 season, and, well, you saw how that turned out.\n\nIs today your birthday? Happy birthday! Three former Orioles were born on this day: left-hander Doug Johns (58), righty Mike Fetters (61), and the late outfielder Chito Martínez (b. 1965, d. 2025), the only Belize-born player in MLB history.\n\nThe Orioles have made a bunch of free agent signings on this date, so maybe they’ll add one to the list today. In 1991, they signed former Cy Young and Rookie of the Year winner Rick Sutcliffe. The 36-year-old was at the tail end of his career, but he cemented a place in O’s history by pitching a complete game shutout in the inaugural game at Oriole Park on April 6, 1992.\n\nIn 1996, the O’s signed veteran outfielder Eric Davis to a two-year contract. Davis memorably overcame a battle with cancer during the 1997 season to return to the field that same year, and he put together the longest hitting streak in Orioles history with a 30-gamer in 1998.\n\nAnd on this date in 2000, the Orioles signed former AL Cy Young winner Pat Hentgen to a three-year deal as a replacement for longtime ace Mike Mussina, who had left the O’s for the Yankees two weeks earlier. Hentgen, despite his previous success, was no Mussina. Hentgen underwent Tommy John surgery in August of 2001, and made only 40 starts in his three seasons with the Birds.",

    "fullText": "Borussia Dortmund will look to close out the year on a much-needed high, with Borussia Mönchengladbach coming to town tonight.\n\nWhile BVB started the season strong but have sputtered of late, Gladbach have had the opposite fortunes, having recently turned things round and gone on a bit of a run. Die Fohlen have won three, drawn one, and lost one in their last five league games, and have climbed to 11th as a result, having been in the relegation zone early in the season. Dortmund, on the other hand, are actually undefeated in their last five league games, but they have won just twice over that stretch.\n\nDortmund should really be heavy favourites this evening, but there’s no doubt Gladbach will be feeling like they can get a result at the Westfalenstadion. BVB are low on confidence and if they drop points here they will have a month to stew on it.\n\nAll of Borussia Mönchengladbach’s success runs through Haris Tabakovic at the moment. Having joined Gladbach this summer, he has scored seven goals and assisted another three (1.01 npG+A/90) so far this season. I’m not entirely convinced he can keep it up, but he’s all they’ve got so they are going to keep going back to that well.\n\nGladbach haven’t been great on either side of the ball, but their defense is at least a team effort. Going forward, everything channels through Tabakovic. Everyone else’s job is to create chances for Tabakovic, and Tabakovic’s job is to finish those chances. So far he’s doing that job pretty well!\n\nTabakovic has never been a reliable goalscorer at the top level, but he seems to be on a run of form now. Maybe Die Fohlen have unearthed a gem?\n\nBVB will be without Jobe Bellingham who is serving a two-game suspension, and Ramy Bensebaini who has headed off to the African Cup of Nations. Waldemar Anton and Aaron Anselmino are both out with knocks, but Marcel Sabitzer, Julian Brandt, and Salih Özcan are all back and should be available to play a part. As a result, there will be some changes to the starting eleven. Some by choice, some less so.\n\nI’m sure Kovač would ideally like to bring both Marcel Sabitzer and Julian Brandt back in, but I’m not sure he will be willing to lean on two returning players to start the game, so I think Brandt will play a part from the bench.\n\nI think Carney Chukwuemeka will get the start ahead of Brandt, and I’ve gone for Niklas Süle to fill out the backline with everyone else out.\n\nI’m not confident about my pick tonight because Dortmund have been so shaky recently. It feels like this is the kind of game they should be winning, but they could easily stumble out the blocks and find themselves in real trouble against a Gladbach side full of confidence.\n\nPredicting Ball gives Dortmund a 60.5% probability of winning, compared against a 19.8% probability of a Gladbach win and a 19.7% probability of a draw. I think I’d give Gladbach a slightly better chance than that, given the context surrounding both sides right now, but it’s still difficult to look past the fact that this is a game Dortmund should be winning.\n\nBorussia Dortmund 2-1 Borussia Mönchengladbach\n\nWho do you think comes out on top tonight? Let us know in the comments.",

    "fullText": "After celebrating the end of a near year-long wait for a win, Dragons hunt a first United Rugby Championship (URC) success in 15 months against Connacht in Newport on Saturday.\n\nThe Rodney Parade club fought back from 21-6 down with 65 minutes played to beat Lyon 23-21 in the European Challenge Cup on Sunday.\n\nDragons have not won back-to-back competitive games since October 2022 when they beat Ospreys and then Zebre in Newport.\n\nHowever, head coach Filo Tiatia will be without talisman Aaron Wainwright against Connacht because of a niggle, with the Wales number eight not risked prior to festive derbies with Cardiff and Scarlets.\n\nHis fellow Wales internationals Ben Carter and Rio Dyer do return, at lock and wing, after being rested against Lyon.\n\nThe win against the French side was Dragons' first since a European success at Newcastle in December 2024, while the wait for a URC victory is even longer with the winless streak currently on 23 fixtures.\n\nTiatia was defence coach under Dai Flanagan when Ospreys were pipped in the last minute on the opening weekend of last season on 20 September, 2024.\n\n\"There were a lot of tough days and defeats wear you down,\" admitted former Dragons wing Ashton Hewitt, who retired in the summer, on the Scrum V podcast.\n\n\"It takes quite a bit of character as a unit to stay in the fight and keep grinding away to get the win.\n\n\"There is always the belief, otherwise what is the point in turning up?\"\n\nTiatia is yet to taste victory in the URC as head coach after Dragons blew chances at the death against both Sharks and Ospreys in the first block of the current campaign.\n\nThe short turnaround to face Connacht, who cruised past Georgian side Black Lion 52-0 in Galway last Saturday, has focused minds in at the region's Ystrad Mynach training centre this week.\n\n\"We won and you celebrate the moments – but then you go again,\" said Tiatia.\n\n\"We have seven more games in this ten-week block and there is a lot more work to do, still things to improve on.\"\n\nDragons to fight to keep Wales forward Wainwright\n\nDragons sign South African prop Dlamini\n\nTiatia freshens up his XV because of the six-day turnaround, with Harri Keddie promoted to number eight in the absence of both Wainwright and Mackenzie Martin.\n\nKeddie is part of a new back row trio with blind-side Ryan Woodman and openside Harry Beddall, while lock Carter and loose-head prop Rodrigo Martinez also come in up front.\n\nTonga international Fine Inisi gets the nod at outside centre - his first start in that position after previously playing wing - while there is a starting chance for scrum-half Che Hope after a lively cameo last weekend.\n\nHooker George Roberts, who signed from Doncaster last week, and tight-head prop Cebo Dlamini, who arrived from Griquas in South Africa on Tuesday, are set for debuts off the bench.\n\nDragons: O'Brien; J Rosser, Inisi, Owen, Dyer; De Beer, Hope; Martinez, Burrows, Hunt, Douglas, Carter (capt), Woodman, Beddall, Keddie.\n\nReplacements: G Roberts, Morris, Dlamini, Lewis-Hughes, Young, R Williams, Westwood, Anderson.\n\nConnacht: Gilbert; Chay Mullins, Forde, Aki, Bolton; Ioane, Blade; Duggan, Heffernan, Illo, D Murray, N Murray, Prendergast (capt), O'Brien, Boyle.\n\nReplacements: Tierney-Martin, Buckley, Bealham, J Murphy, Jansen, B Murphy, Carty, Gavin.\n\nReferee: Ru Campbell (Scotland)\n\nAssistants: Rob McDowell, Jonny Mackenzie (Wales)",

It’s obviously just comfortability thing, getting used to the level of play.” said Gillotte, “Everyone’s the top player in this league and you’re going to get the best shot from everyone every week. Just being able to be more comfortable on the field (and) not think as much about plays and stuff, that’s kind of what has helped me, and just continuing to build.”\n\nThe former Louisville standout secured his first NFL interception in Week 15 against the Los Angeles Chargers. Gillotte discussed his personal goals for the final three games, which he can build on as he enters the offseason.\n\n“Just to finish it strong. Obviously, we know the playoff picture isn’t there, but we still have pride to play for, and we still have the name on our back and the colors we represent,” said Gillotte. “We just want to make the people proud going into the last games.”\n\nGillotte has 27 total tackles and 1.5 sacks to go along with his line interception through 14 games this season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs DE Ashton Gillotte on weekly improvement, playing for pride",

    "fullText": "Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald saw his team convert a pair of two-point plays on their way to coming back from 16 points down to tie the Rams in the fourth quarter on Thursday night and he went for the hat trick in overtime.\n\nAfter Sam Darnold's touchdown pass to Jaxon Smith-Njigba brought them within one point with 3:17 to play in extra time, the Seahawks picked up a win when Darnold scanned the field and found tight end Eric Saubert for the game-winning points. After the game, Macdonald said it was a situation that he and offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak had planned for and explained his thought process in the moment.\n\n\"Well, it was something we had talked about really throughout the season and then really particularly for this game because of the playoff situation,\" Macdonald said, via a transcript from the team. \"You know, do you play for the tie and lock up a playoff seed. I just felt great about our play and I trusted our guys. To Klint's credit, he was really confident and then the players ultimately make it happen. Once we got that drive going it was pretty clear what we were going to do.\"\n\nA tie would have clinched a playoff spot, but it would have made it more difficult for the Seahawks to win the division and it never felt like a real option for the Seahawks to go that route in overtime. They chose to kick after winning the toss, which meant that they'd know just what they needed to win once they got the ball and suggested that Macdonald would go that route under any circumstances. The amount of time left on the clock when they scored meant the Rams would have plenty of time to position themselves for a game-winning score in the final seconds, so there was every reason in the world for the Seahawks to leave their offense on the field to win the game.\n\nThat's just what they did and it will go down as one of the most memorable victories in franchise history.",

He insulted him nonstop. And I remember the last insult; it wasn't such a generic insult. The fifth insult he threw was: 'You're a brown-noser'.

    "description": "Taking a look at the 2025 Miami Hurricanes and Texas A&M Aggies as Ohio State awaits winner for Cotton Bowl showdown.",
    "fullText": "The Ohio State Buckeyes are gearing up to face either the Miami Hurricanes or the Texas A&M Aggies in just under two weeks in a College Football Playoff Cotton Bowl quarterfinal. Ohio State would be favored against either opponent, but both bring distinct challenges and would pose legitimate tests on a big stage.\n\nAs it stands, Texas A&M is a 3.5-point favorite over Miami, with that matchup set to be played on the Aggies’ home field. That raises an obvious question: who would the Buckeyes rather see across the sideline? And who exactly are the 2025 Hurricanes and Aggies?\n\nTo answer that, let’s take a closer look at how each team’s season has unfolded so far, breaking down their strengths, weaknesses, and what Ohio State can realistically expect from either opponent on New Year’s night in Arlington at 7:30 p.m. ET.\n\nMiami is a fascinating case study, and I think they are quietly one of the stronger CFP teams in the 2025 bracket. The Hurricanes opened the season with a statement win over Notre Dame, a result that ultimately played a major role in punching their ticket to the Playoff. They followed that up with five straight victories before stumbling against a feisty Louisville team, 24–21, in a game where quarterback Carson Beck threw four interceptions.\n\nMiami bounced back with a blowout win over Stanford, only to suffer another setback the following week in an overtime loss to SMU, again plagued by turnovers as Beck tossed two interceptions. From that point on, however, the Hurricanes flipped the switch. They won every remaining game by 17 points or more, and Beck threw just one interception over the final four contests.\n\nOffensively, Miami ranks No. 27 nationally in total offense and features playmakers across the board. Running back Mark Fletcher is a reliable and physical runner who finished with 10 rushing touchdowns while averaging 4.9 yards per carry. The wide receiver room is deep and diverse, highlighted by BYU transfer Keelan Marion, LSU transfer CJ Daniels, and freshman phenom Malachi Toney. Toney has been electric, leading the team in receptions with 84, yards with 970, and tying for the team lead in receiving touchdowns with seven. The real engine of this offense is the offensive line. As expected under head coach Mario Cristobal, the foundation of this unit is built up front. Beck has been sacked just nine times all season, and both the run and pass games have consistently operated in clean pockets and wide-open lanes.\n\nDefensively, Miami has been just as impressive. The Hurricanes rank No. 11 nationally, allowing only 19 touchdowns and an average of 277.8 yards per game. Miami is built to control the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball, and the centerpiece is defensive lineman Rueben Bain Jr., a projected top-10 pick in April’s NFL Draft and one of the most dominant pass rushers in the country. Bain combines elite power, quick hands, and a deep pass-rush arsenal to overwhelm offensive linemen in both the run and pass game.\n\nMiami also invested heavily in its secondary this past offseason, and the payoff has been clear. The Hurricanes boast two cornerbacks with four interceptions apiece, while the linebackers do a solid job of keeping plays in front of them and limiting explosive gains. The defensive line is special, and the back end is more than capable of capitalizing on the pressure it creates.\n\nIf Beck stays clean and makes sound decisions in the pocket, especially by limiting turnovers, Miami becomes a difficult out. They control the trenches, protect their quarterback, and feature difference-makers on both sides of the ball.\n\nNot long ago, Texas A&M was viewed as part of the sport’s top tier, grouped with teams like Ohio State and Indiana, and even discussed by some fans and analysts as the best team in the country. Now, the Aggies enter the postseason as the No. 7 seed, carrying more questions after closing the regular season with a loss to Texas.\n\nLike Miami, A&M owns a narrow shootout win over Notre Dame, beating the Irish by one point in Week 3. The rest of the season, however, was filled with blowouts and close calls. The Aggies survived Auburn at home by six points, outlasted Arkansas 45–42, and escaped South Carolina 31–30 before their undefeated run ended with a 10-point loss to the Longhorns in Week 12. Head coach Mike Elko deserves credit for navigating those tight spots, but Texas A&M also exposed some real vulnerabilities along the way, particularly at quarterback.\n\nMarcel Reed is a dynamic talent, but he dealt with turnover issues similar to Miami’s Carson Beck. Reed finished the season with 10 interceptions and three fumbles, mistakes that often put the Aggies in early holes. Still, his ability to flip a game on its head is undeniable. The South Carolina matchup is the perfect example. A&M trailed 30–3 at halftime, with Reed already responsible for two interceptions and a fumble. In the second half, he caught fire, finishing with 439 yards and three touchdowns to engineer a stunning comeback victory.\n\nOffensively, Texas A&M ranks 20th in total offense and features a receiver group that mirrors Miami’s in both depth and talent. NC State transfer KC Concepcion, a likely first-round pick, Mississippi State transfer Mario Craver, and freshman Ashton Bethel-Roman form the core of the passing attack. Together, they accounted for 18 of Reed’s 25 passing touchdowns. On the ground, the Aggies deploy a true three-headed monster in Rueben Owens II, Le’Veon Moss, and Reed himself. All three averaged more than five yards per carry and scored at least five rushing touchdowns. As with Miami, the offensive line is a major strength. Reed was sacked just 10 times all season, and the fact that four different runners averaged over five yards per carry on at least 41 attempts is staggering.\n\nDefensively, Texas A&M ranks No. 19 nationally and features one of the most disruptive pass rushers in the country in Cashius Howell, who recorded 11.5 sacks in 2025. The Aggies totaled 41 sacks as a team and recovered six fumbles, though they managed just three interceptions. The defensive line consistently pressures quarterbacks, but the unit has shown vulnerability against explosive offenses, both on the ground and through the air. That inconsistency showed up in games where A&M surrendered 40 points to Notre Dame, 42 to Arkansas, 25 to LSU, and 30 to South Carolina. The defense is solid, but far from lockdown.\n\nWith Marcel Reed under center, Texas A&M always has a puncher’s chance. The Aggies have the firepower to go blow-for-blow with anyone in the country, and their defense has a knack for generating timely sacks in critical moments. If Reed stays protected and cuts down on mistakes, this is a dangerous team capable of catching fire at the right time.\n\nI view Miami and Texas A&M as very similar teams, and Ohio State should expect both offenses to prioritize establishing the run to set up explosive plays downfield with their dynamic wide receivers. On the defensive side, each will likely take a page from Indiana’s game plan against the Buckeyes by dialing up creative blitz packages, testing the Ohio State offensive line, and trying to make Julian Sayin uncomfortable in the pocket.\n\nI have Miami pulling out a win in College Station, largely because I trust Carson Beck to avoid a turnover-heavy performance. Texas A&M is tied for 128th nationally in interceptions forced, one of the worst marks in the country. If Beck limits his mistakes to fewer than two turnovers, I think Miami comes out on top.\n\nOhio State will be patiently waiting to see who emerges from this matchup, with the Cotton Bowl looming just over a week away.\n\nContact/Follow us @BuckeyesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Ohio State news, notes, and opinion.

    "fullText": "What happens when a YouTuber-turned-professional boxer steps into the ring with a two-time unified heavyweight champion and former Olympic gold medalist with more than double the fighting experience? That's what we'll find out when Jake Paul meets Anthony Joshua.\n\nPaul vs. Joshua takes place Friday night at Kaseya Center in Miami.\n\nPaul originally was slated to meet another decorated, albeit much smaller, boxing champ in Gervonta Davis – that is, until the scheduled Nov. 14 fight was canceled in the wake of Davis facing allegations of assaulting his ex-girlfriend at a strip club. Shortly after, Joshua surprisingly accepted a lucrative offer to replace Davis and fight Paul, flipping the script entirely when it comes to the size discrepancy.\n\nWith Paul vs. Joshua almost upon us, here's everything you need to know.\n\nIn short, the size difference between Paul and Joshua is huge.\n\nPaul is listed at 6-foot-1 with a reach of 76 inches. Joshua stands 6-foot-5 with a reach of 82 inches. At Thursday's weigh-ins, Paul was 216.6 pounds, with Joshua tipping the scale at 243.4. Because of the naturally huge size difference, Joshua was contractually obligated to weigh in no heavier than 245.\n\nPaul made his professional boxing debut in January 2020 and has 13 fights under his belt, posting a 12-1 record with seven knockouts. Six of Paul's fights have been against UFC veterans, two against aging boxers (Mike Tyson and Julio Cesar Chavez Jr.), one against a former NBA player, and one against an influencer. Paul's lone defeat came against Tommy Fury, the younger brother of former heavyweight champ Tyson Fury, by split decision in February 2023.\n\nJoshua began boxing as an 18-year-old amateur in 2007. He won Olympic gold for Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Games before turning professional in October 2013. Joshua has 32 fights under his belt, posting a 28-4 record with 25 knockouts. He has twice been the unified heavyweight champion of the world.\n\nPaul is 28 years old (he turns 29 on Jan. 17). Joshua is 36 and most recently had a birthday on Oct. 15.\n\nPaul vs. Joshua is a professional bout that has been sanctioned by the Florida Athletic Commission.\n\nPaul vs. Joshua is scheduled for eight, 3-minute rounds.\n\nAcross the board, Joshua is a big betting favorite to win the fight. Here are the odds from three major online sportsbooks:\n\nFan Duel: Joshua -850, Paul +550\n\nDraftKings: Joshua -1000, Paul +650\n\nThe Paul vs. Joshua prelims start at 4:45 p.m. ET and will be live streamed for free on YouTube. The Paul vs. Joshua main card begins at 8 p.m. ET and is available to watch live on Netflix for anyone with a standard subscription, free of a pay-per-view charge.\n\nPaul and Joshua are expected to walk out to the ring at approximately 10:30 p.m. ET\n\nHeavyweight: Jake Paul vs. Anthony Joshua\n\nSuper-featherweight: Alycia Baumgardner (c) vs. Leila Beaudoin\n\nCruiserweight: Anderson Silva (191.4) vs. Tyron Woodley\n\nBantamweight: Cherneka Johnson (c) vs. Amanda Galle\n\nLightweight: Caroline Dubois (c) vs. Camilla Panatta\n\nStrawweight: Yokasta Valle (c) vs. Yadira Bustillos\n\nWelterweight: Avious Griffin vs. Justin Cardona\n\nCruiserweight: Keno Marley vs. Diarra Davis Jr.\n\nJahmal Harvey vs. Kevin Cervantes\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: Jake Paul vs. Anthony Joshua viewers guide: What you need to know",

    "description": "Sacks are important, but as Dan Quinn says, there is more to the pass rush than just sack totals.",
    "fullText": "How many sacks does he have this year?\n\nThat's often how we judge a NFL defensive lineman.\n\nThat's often how we evaluate a defensive lineman's production during the season. But Washington Commanders head coach Dan Quinn wanted to ensure on Thursday that the press understood it is not quite that simplistic. There are other aspects coaches stress and look for from their defensive pass rushers.\n\nWhen responding to a question regarding pass rushing, Quinn stated, \"It's such an important part of (defense). Sometimes it's not the sack, but it's the pressure, and can you move a quarterback where he has to get off the first read and get into the next spot? And so that's often what I look for first.\"\n\nJalen Hurts is on pace for his lowest rushing totals of his career. He has just 84 carries for 329 yards through 12 games which is a 466 yard pace in a season where he’s never finished under 600.\n\nThere have even been reports that he’s asked to scale back his role in the run… https://t.co/8y8SRXGONF pic.twitter.com/LEGMUpPTHk\n\n— Fly Eagles Fly Bets (@Fly_EaglesBets) December 4, 2025\n\nThe Commanders' defensive coaches are no doubt going to be preaching to their pass rushers that they must maintain a pass rush lane when facing Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts, on Saturday. If Washington's pass rushers don't preserve those rush lanes, Hurts will take advantage of those gaping holes and embarrass the Commanders' defense, picking up numerous first downs.\n\nQuinn continued regarding rushing the passer, \"So often in pass force can I beat somebody to the punch, you know, the speed, the disruption to go. Sometimes that's from a blitz where you can overload a side or a running back with the right matchup, but if it's a four-man (rush) you got to go win and you got to jump off the ball and beat somebody to the spot even if you're not sacking them.\"\n\n\"I think maybe the clearest example of that at the end of the first half [OLB] Von [Miller] had a good pressure. He wasn't able to sack [New York Giants Quarterback Jaxson] Dart on the play, he got them on the next one, but the scramble was an incomplete, so those are the plays that I look for as well. They don't show up as much on the stat sheet, but they're super important.\n\nIndeed, the Commanders will want to see if they can provide a controlled rush that keeps Hurts from getting outside the pocket, keeping him inside of it, and forcing him to beat the Commanders by throwing the ball from the pocket. Who knows, Hurts might still beat them throwing from the pocket, but the coaches know that if they can't keep Hurts contained in the pocket, they have no chance.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Dan Quinn breaks down the pass rush",

    "fullText": "Sometimes certain loves take immense detours and then come back, sometimes football can deliver surprising returns. Rhetoric aside, Serie A has taught us that age can be just a number, and so the possibility of seeing Thiago Silva in Serie A again is not so remote.\n\nWatch all of Serie BKT live on OneFootball for only €9.99 per month. \n\nAfter Modric’s arrival in August, the return of the Brazilian defender to Milan is making fans dream, but above all, it could rewrite a record that was broken only this summer. It’s all about turning 41 last September.\n\nCurrently, Edin Dzeko holds the record as the oldest outfield player to return to Serie A, signing with Fiorentina at 39 years and 3 months.

After losing to rival Texas on the road almost a month ago, the Aggies have had plenty of time to fix their remaining issues and prepare to face one of the more complete teams in the country on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThroughout the month, the health status of senior running back Le'Veon Moss has been the primary talking point, knowing that the Aggies would have likely finished 12-0 with a chance at an SEC Championship if Moss had not been injured against Florida in late October.\n\nWith an ankle injury, head coach Mike Elko has kept things under wraps for the most part, while confirming on Wednesday that he remains in \"wait-and-see mode\" regarding his star back's status. However, the first official injury report, which was released on Wednesday, designated Moss as \"questionable\" with a 50% chance to play, coupled with linebacker Scooby Williams and safety Bryce Anderson as \"probable\" with a 75% chance to take the field.\n\nOn Thursday night, just minutes after Texas A&M's Volleyball team swept No. 1 Pitt 3-0 to earn its first trip to the National Championship Game, the latest injury report revealed good news for the Aggies, as Williams and Anderson were not included in the injury report, while Moss remains questionable.\n\nGetting both defenders back is great news for Texas A&M's run defense, which has struggled early in games.

    "fullText": "Nick Saban blasts the CFP for picking ‘Triple-A’ teams over Notre Dame\n\nOne of the biggest names in college football, multiple championship winning former Alabama head coach Nick Saban, still has plenty of say in the game.\n\nOn Thursday, the ESPN analyst joined Pat McAfee and was asked about James Madison and Tulane getting into the field over Notre Dame, and he was very blunt with his assessment. He said “would be allow the winner of the AAA baseball league… into the World Series playoff? … That’s the equivalent of what we do when JMU gets in the College Football Playoff and Notre Dame doesn’t.”\n\nPreach coach! That’s exactly how we feel about the situation also. Sure, they had a great season, but are they really a better football team than the Irish? Not many feel that is the case.\n\nThe conversation hasn’t stopped since Notre Dame was snubbed out of the CFP, and it will certainly continue as the games are played and as we enter the offseason. Except more to question the inclusion of JMU and Tulane, especially if they struggle to put up a fight during the first round games this weekend.\n\nNick Saban says James Madison getting into the College Football Playoff over Notre Dame is the equivalent of a Triple AAA team qualifying for the MLB playoffs. pic.twitter.com/FvDQwyzJoo\n\n— Tyler Horka (@tbhorka) December 18, 2025\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: Nick Saban blasts the CFP for picking ‘Triple-A’ teams over Notre Dame",

    "description": "The Tennessee Titans host the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday, and here are three reasons for optimism in Week 16.",
    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs are traveling to Nashville to face the Tennessee Titans in Week 16. The game will be played at noon CST/1:00 p.m. EST on CBS.\n\nThe Chiefs and Titans both come in hobbled, but this game will be crucial for draft positioning.\n\nThe Titans have reasons to be optimistic for a win this week. Here are three of them.\n\nThe Chiefs come into this game majorly banged up and without incentive to win after being eliminated from playoff contention. Their injury list on Thursday read like a grocery list. Rashee Rice, the Chiefs' best wide receiver, will likely miss the game. Chris Jones is managing a hamstring issue, Jawaan Taylor with an elbow issue, and Jaylon Moore with a knee issue. That's two offensive tackles in an already banged-up offensive line. Of course, Patrick Mahomes was also put on the injured reserve. That Mahomes' injury has led the team to put Gardner Minshew in his stead.\n\nMinshew is a familiar quarterback for the Titans' defense. They have played him many times over the years, having had crucial stints as the Jaguars' and Colts' quarterback. Most recently, this team faced him in 2023 when he was manning the Colts. This familiarity with Minshew will help the Titans' game plan, having faced him six times before. This familiarity goes in the Titans' favor.\n\nThe Titans' offensive line has been putting together great performances, making it two weeks in a row now. They allowed zero sacks last week and were creating monstrous holes for Tony Pollard to run into. With the injuries on the Chiefs' defensive line, they have a good shot of building on their previous performances. Confidence is rising that this unit should stick together into next season. What's most crucial for the offensive line now is finishing this season healthy and having a healthy offseason together.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Titans Wire: Tennessee Titans vs. Chiefs: 3 reasons for optimism in Week 16",

Striker Keito Kamashiro will also head to the Bundesliga outfit from Japanese third division side Roasso Kumamoto. The 18-year-old will initially play for the Eintracht reserves.\n\nDetails about the transfer fee were not divulged, but Transfermarkt lists Kamashiro as a €400,000 transfer. Kamashiro, Kosugi, and Swedish talent Love Arrhov may not immediately be prepared to make first team appearances, but the Hessen-club remains pleased to have secured three developmental prospects ahead of the second half of the season.\n\n“Keito Kumashiro is a very talented striker who has already gained experience in adult football at a young age,” Frankfurt sporting director Timmo Hardung noted in a club statement. “The move to Europe and the Bundesliga is a big step, which is why the focus at the beginning will be on carefully developing him and allowing him to adapt.”",

    "description": "Gavin McKenna, Ivar Stenberg and Keaton Verhoeff could star at the world juniors, but if the NHL draft were held today, who fits where in the top 16?",
    "fullText": "The 2026 NHL Draft class is entering a pivotal point in the scouting calendar.\n\nThe World Junior Championship marks a huge moment every season for the draft-eligible players who earn the opportunity to showcase their skills on junior hockey's biggest stage.\n\nNot all of the projected lottery selections at the upcoming draft will end up appearing in the event, with top rosters like Team USA, Team Canada and Team Sweden bringing older and more established prospects.\n\nHowever, undrafted stars like Gavin McKenna, Ivar Stenberg and Viggo Bjorck are all primed to play prominent roles at this year's tournament, giving hockey fans a chance to see what the next wave of young stars has to offer.\n\nConsidering the current NHL standings, the organizational needs of the teams positioned to select in the lottery, and how the world juniors could impact their stock, let's look at one of many ways the top 16 picks in the draft could fall next summer.\n\n(Draft order determined by standings, sorted by points percentage, before games on Dec. 18, 2025)\n\nAfter the blockbuster trade that sent star defenseman Quinn Hughes to the Minnesota Wild, the future is the focus for the Vancouver Canucks. Stenberg is entering the world juniors as Sweden's hottest offensive player, leading Frolunda with 24 points in 25 games in the Swedish League. He elevates those around him with his vision and hockey IQ and will be an integral part of a Swedish forward group that's already filled with drafted players.\n\nFor Calgary Flames fans, all eyes should be on Team Canada for this tournament. Expectations have been high for Gavin McKenna, and he's struggled to meet them in his first season in the NCAA, but this best-on-best competition allows him to silence his doubters. This is the strongest group of players he's ever been surrounded by, and he's projected to play in a top-line role where his dynamic playmaking will be on full display.\n\nNext year will be the opportunity for Tynan Lawrence to shine at the world juniors, but he's been one of the most valuable players in the United States Hockey League since returning to the lineup with the Muskegon Lumberjacks. He put up 11 points in his first five games back while dominating in transition with his elite skating. There's a chance he leads a lot of teams' draft boards by the end of the season.\n\nKeaton Verhoeff will likely rotate in as an extra defensive option for Canada at the world juniors, considering the team's depth at the position. But the fact that he's still on the team after the first cuts reinforces his status as the top defender in this class. He's consistently been the most effective player for North Dakota, and his ice time is reflecting it, putting up 11 points in 16 games while playing upward of 20 minutes a night.\n\nIt was going to be difficult for Xavier Villeneuve to crack Canada's world junior roster with Calgary Flames prospect Zayne Parekh carrying the offensive load from the blueline, but his stock is still rising as this draft's top offensive defenseman. Villeneuve has 33 points in 29 games and is extremely shifty while walking the line in the offensive zone, possessing all the tools to quarterback a power play at the NHL level someday.\n\nChase Reid has been one of the class' most incredible stories, going from an overlooked prospect in the North American Hockey League last season to becoming one of the Ontario Hockey League's top scoring defenders with hopes of cracking Team USA's world junior roster. He's a high-end athlete who defends with purpose, along with great offensive instincts and a blistering shot that combine to make him one of the most intriguing prospects to watch this season.\n\nEthan Belchetz projects to be the perfect long-term fit to play alongside Connor Bedard. A 6-foot-5, 228-pound power forward with the hands of an elite playmaker, Belchetz is a physical presence who's great along the walls and in front of the net. Few players have a ceiling as high as Belchetz. It would be a home-run selection for the Blackhawks if they were to land him next summer as a complementary piece for their future.\n\nAdam Novotny is one of the few returning draft-eligible players at this year's world juniors. Team Czechia will rely on him as a key offensive player with high-end shooting and the details that make him reliable in all on-ice situations. His time in Czechia's top pro league as an underager prepared him for a relatively seamless transition to the OHL with the Peterborough Petes, where he has put up 35 points in his first 29 games.\n\nAlberts Smits headlines a young Latvian roster at this year's world juniors with players eligible to be selected in the 2026 and 2027 drafts. He's playing a top-pairing role in Finland's top professional league, has tightened up his defensive game and has huge offensive upside in his willingness to activate in the rush. It will be tough for Latvia to find scoring, but Smits will have free rein to generate rush offense and should be fun to watch.\n\nWhile Verhoeff's inclusion was expected, Carels was a surprising addition as a draft-eligible defenseman on Canada's preliminary world junior roster. However, scoring 29 points in his first 28 games made him a worthy candidate for a tryout. If he sticks around, he won't be logging huge minutes as he has been with Prince George, but his vision, competitive motor and hockey sense have him projected as a top-four defenseman with a polished two-way game.\n\nLin is one of the most intelligent and dependable defenders in this class. There's not one elite tool that has emerged just yet, but he's putting up great point totals with the Vancouver Giants once again after being the second blueliner in the last 35 years to put up 50 points as a 16-year-old in the Western Hockey League. Getting him at the 11th pick would be a huge win for the Columbus Blue Jackets.\n\nIn 2023, the NHL ruled the Ottawa Senators would have to forfeit one first-round pick in either 2024, 2025 or 2026. The Senators failed to disclose Evgenii Dadonov's limited no-trade clause when they moved him to Vegas in 2021, leading to an invalidated trade between the Golden Knights and Anaheim Ducks in 2022. Since Ottawa chose Carter Yakemchuk seventh overall in 2024 and Logan Hensler 23rd overall in 2025, it forfeits this year's pick.\n\nSuvanto has quickly emerged as the top Finnish prospect in the 2026 class and enters the world juniors as the youngest player on Finland's roster. He's an extremely detailed center with impressive defensive habits and a competitive edge that has earned him a middle-six role with Tappara, the best team in Finland's pro circuit. He'll frustrate opposing players throughout this tournament and could cement his status as a lottery pick with a good performance.\n\nRudolph is a steady shutdown defender who's elevated his offensive game, recording seven goals and 12 points in his last seven games with Prince Albert. He's found ways to use his size and mobility to unlock a layer of activation on the rush that he hasn't always had. If he's able to continue to produce and show the same poise offensively as he does as a defenseman, he could be selected much higher.\n\nPreston has followed up his impressive performance at the U-18 Hlinka Gretzky Cup with a decent start on a middling Spokane Chiefs team, putting up 29 points in his first 31 games. His offense hasn't taken off as anticipated, but his speed, deception and willingness to step up in clutch moments of games still make him one of the top forward prospects in this draft. He could become a household name at next year's world juniors with Canada.\n\nViggo Bjorck will likely suit up for Sweden on a line with his brother Wilson, a Vancouver Canucks prospect. They were the top two scorers in Sweden's junior league in 2024-25. Bjorck has developed into a workhorse in the Swedish League, with high-end handling and creative playmaking. Despite being undersized at 5-foot-9, he plays a fearless game that sets him up to play a huge role at this year's world juniors.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: NHL mock draft 2026: Stenberg, McKenna lead pre-world juniors top 16",

    "description": "Dillon Thieneman could be an upgrade for Cincinnati at safety.",
    "fullText": "With the College Football Playoff kicking off, here are some of the most notable NFL Draft prospects to watch for this weekend.\n\nAlabama against Oklahoma is a rematch from earlier this season. Oklahoma pulled out a close victory against the Crimson Tide 23 to 21 in that game. I expect this game to come right down to the wire once again. We have previously discussed some Alabama prospects like Kadyn Proctor, Tim Keenan III, Deontae Lawson, and Keon Sabb. The Cincinnati Bengals could be looking to add a cornerback to replace Cam Taylor-Britt going into next year. Alabama’s Domani Jackson could be a player who intrigues the Bengals. He feels like a player that could go anywhere from rounds three to five during the draft this year. While he hasn’t had the season that many expected, he is still a solid draft prospect. He is expected to run a 4.3 40-yard dash or potentially even lower. Jackson is a great athlete with return ability, an excellent run defender, and rarely misses a tackle. He has an incredible 2.6% missed tackle rate on the 2025 season.\n\nDomani Jackson (Alabama CB #1)\n-Uses his long frame to force receivers off of their route and disrupt timing of the play\n-Shows scheme flexibility and is capable in both man and zone coverage\n-Has moments where his build and toughness align effectively as a true bump and run… pic.twitter.com/CYIsf4ShLT\n\n— Owen Denny (@OwenDennyNFL) December 4, 2025\n\nOklahoma has a plethora of defensive talent that should be of interest to the Bengals. We have mentioned previously R.Mason Thomas, Robert Spears-Jennings, Kip Lewis, and Gracen Halton. Another player on that defense worth mentioning for the 2026 NFL Draft is Damonic Williams. Williams is a day three space eating defensive tackle. Williams is listed at 6’1” and 323 pounds. He does his best work as a run defender in the middle of the Sooners defense. Williams originally spent a couple of seasons playing for TCU.\n\nDamonic Williams about to wreck SEC O-Lines! 😤\n pic.twitter.com/veDDTDhX1n\n\n— The Main Line (@TheMainLinePod) May 3, 2024\n\nTexas A&M has a lot of talent in the trenches on both sides of the ball. Cashius Howell, Tyler Onyedim, and Albert Regis headline the defensive line. On the offensive line they are loaded with draft-elibile talent like Trey Zuhn III, Dametrious Crownover, Chase Bisontis, and Ar’maj Reed-Adams. If the Bengals decide to not re-sign Dalton Risner, they may look once again toward the draft for a right guard. While that isn’t a guarantee with Jalen Rivers here, it is at least worth mentioning. Reed-Adams is a right guard prospect that could come in and compete to start early. He is a mauling presence on the interior that loves to finish plays, sometimes to his own detriment with penalties. That type of nasty is something this Cincinnati team is missing.\n\nAr’maj Reed-Adams is a DAWG at Right Guard (even took some Right Tackle snaps in this one) pic.twitter.com/tmBzRySVIh\n\n— Bengals & Brews (@BengalsBrews) May 8, 2025\n\nMiami is equally as impressive on both sides of the ball in the trenches. On offense, they have Francis Mauigoa, Markel Bell, Anez Cooper, and James Brockermyer. On the defensive line they have Rueben Bain Jr., Ahmad Moten Sr., and Akheem Mesidor. Mesidor is an older prospect that will be turning 25 years old. We have seen previously with the pick of Demetrius Knight Jr., that age may not scare the Bengals off from taking an older guy on day two. Mesidor has 30 career sacks between his time at West Virginia and Miami. When healthy, he is an explosive pass rusher with a quick first step and a variety of pass rush moves in his arsenal. He has a 29.9% win rate on true pass sets during the 2025 season.\n\nAkheem Mesidor (#3) Miami vs. Notre Dame – Mesidor will turn 25 years old in April and has put up 7 sacks, 43 pressures, and 4 forced fumbles so far this season. \n\nAt 6’3” 280 pounds he offers inside and outside versatility along the defensive line. He is a high effort player,… pic.twitter.com/gZ8wqkZ7aS\n\n— Bengals & Brews (@BengalsBrews) November 26, 2025\n\nOle Miss will be entering this game without former head coach Lane Kiffin. Kiffin will not be coaching in the playoffs after taking the LSU job. Ole Miss still has a ton of talented players and should easily handle Tulane this weekend. Zxavian Harris is a big-bodied defensive tackle I have previously discussed. They also have Dae’quan Wright, Harrison Wallace III, and De’Zhaun Stribling as offensive weapons. Another player that continues to intrigue me is Suntarine Perkins. The Bengals have tried to use Demetrius Knight Jr. as a player that can come off the edge at times with limited results. While Knight did put up two sacks this week, it was while playing the role of a spy on Lamar Jackson. If they want a player with real pass rush juice from the linebacker position, Perkins may be there guy. Perkins had 10.5 sacks last season while playing more on the edge. This year, he has just two sacks but has shown that he can play more as an off-ball linebacker, which he needed to do at only 6’1” 210 pounds.\n\nOle Miss's Suntarine Perkins might be my favorite prospect I watched all summer. Can't remember someone his size (6-1, 210) playing on the line of scrimmage in a major conference and still being a difference maker. \n\nDon't care where he plays, I want him on my football team pic.twitter.com/EAjzxQJC8Q\n\n— Mike Renner (@mikerenner_) July 30, 2025\n\nFor Tulane, there really isn’t much to talk about for the draft. Quarterback Jake Retzlaff is a transfer from BYU that might get a camp invitation. He is unlikely to be on a roster in the NFL next year. The best prospect for them is defensive tackle/defensive end Santana Hopper, but it sounds like he will be entering the transfer portal and remaining in college football next year.\n\nTulane first-team all-conference DL Santana Hopper is expected to enter the transfer portal following the College Football Playoff, sources tell @On3sports. \n\nHas 13 career sacks. https://t.co/wMrfFrcNOy pic.twitter.com/rOyVZFN4v7\n\n— Pete Nakos (@PeteNakos) December 16, 2025\n\nAnother contest that is likely to be heavily one sided features Oregon taking on James Madison. Oregon has a ton of draft-eligible talent including Dante Moore (QB), Noah Whittington (RB), Kenyon Sadiq (TE), Isaiah World (OT), Alex Harkey (OT), Emmanuel Pregnon (OG), Iapani Laloulu (OC), Matayo Uiagalelei (DE), Bear Alexander (DT), A’Mauri Washington (DT), Bryce Boettcher (LB), Jadon Canady (CB), and Dillon Thieneman (S). Thieneman is the most likely player that could end up a Cincinnati Bengal. The rangy safety prospect has good straight-line speed and has been highly productive for both Purdue and Oregon during his time in college football.\n\nDillon Thieneman vs. Indiana pic.twitter.com/WEel3shdxI\n\n— Bengals & Brews (@BengalsBrews) November 20, 2025\n\nSimilar to Tulane, there really isn’t much for James Madison as far as draft prospects for this year. Wayne Knight is probably the best prospect on their team. However, the running back is listed at just 5’7”. He is listed at weighing around 190 pounds and has shown impressive contact balance. Knight has rushed for almost 1300 yards in 2025. He has also added almost 400 more yards as a receiver. Knight will have to play out of his mind against Oregon for James Madison to even keep this one close.\n\nJust incredible contact balance from James Madison’s Wayne Knight to pop through here.\n\nHe’s top three in the Sun Belt in rushing yards after contact pic.twitter.com/6IELz0SmUM\n\n— Bobby Football (@Rob__Paul) December 6, 2025",

    "description": "Revisiting the most memorable moments and remembering those who played for the Buffalo Bills and Cleveland Browns.",
    "fullText": "The Buffalo Bills (10-4) travel to Cleveland, OH looking for their third-straight win when the Bills face the Cleveland Browns (3-11) at 1 p.m. EST Sunday afternoon.\n\nBefore this Week 16 clash, let’s revisit the series history, relive some of the more memorable matchups, break down those common connections, and go through the list of players who played for both teams. Hint: there are 77 players who saw action for both the Bills and Browns.\n\nSunday’s game will mark the 23rd meeting all time, with Cleveland holding a 13-10 lead in the series. The Browns won the first-ever matchup, 27-10 on November 26, 1972, but Buffalo picked up its first win in the rivalry two years later, knocking off Cleveland 15-10 on November 24, 1974 to improve to 8-3. That Bills team would go on to secure the franchise’s first playoff berth since joining the NFL in 1970 as part of the AFL-NFL merger.\n\nCleveland won seven of the next eight games, including a heartbreaker in the divisional round of the 1989 season. Hall of Fame quarterback Jim Kelly passed for 405 yards with four touchdowns, but was picked off with the Bills driving for the go-ahead score late in the game as Buffalo fell 34-30.\n\nThe two teams split the next six games in the series, and the Bills have won five of the last seven matchups, including a 31-23 triumph on November 20, 2022, a game that was relocated to Detroit, MI after several feet of snow fell in Western New York.\n\nIn that matchup, quarterback Josh Allen and the Bills scored on all five second-half possessions, running backs James Cook III and Devin Singletary each ran for 86 yards (with Singletary scoring on a five-yard run), and Tyler Bass made six field goals in the win. Linebackers Tyrell Dodson and Matt Milano combined for 25 total tackles, Milano added a sack, the Bills’ special teams blocked a field goal and the defense came up with a key stop on Jacoby Brissett’s QB sneak on 4th and 1 in the third quarter.\n\nThe Bills, who enjoyed leads of 28-10 and 31-16, allowed the Browns to pull within eight on Brissett’s two-yard TD toss to Donovan Peoples-Jones with 19 seconds remaining, but running back Taiwan Jones knocked the ensuing onside kick out of bounds and Allen took a knee to seal the win.\n\nIt would be the first of back-to-back games in Detroit. Four days later, on Thanksgiving, the Bills defeated the Detroit Lions by a score of 28-25.\n\nFun fact, Part 1: Don’t worry, Bills fans, I’m not going to torment you here with a recap of the worst football game I’ve ever seen in person, Buffalo’s 6-3 home loss to Cleveland on Oct. 11, 2009. The Browns won despite starting quarterback Derek Anderson completing only 2 of 17 passes for 23 yards with an interception, becoming the first team to win a game when its QB completed two or fewer passes.\n\nIt was the end of a bizarre three-year stretch that saw the Bills drop three painful losses to the Browns from 2007-2009, and the pain all began back when the Bills traveled to Cleveland with their playoff chances still alive during the 2007 season.\n\nThat year, the Bills overcame an 0-3 start to enter Week 15 with a 7-6 record, earning “in the hunt” status as Buffalo searched for its first playoff berth since the 1999 season. The Bills and Browns (8-5) met at Cleveland Browns Stadium on a day where the wind was gusting at up to 40 miles per hour, and a blinding snowstorm settled over the area.\n\nBuffalo saw its playoff chances crushed in the snow, as Phil Dawson booted a pair of first-half field goals and the Browns tacked on a safety when Brian Moorman kicked an overthrown snap on a punt out of the end zone. The Bills fell 8-0, the first game in the NFL to end with that score since the 1929 season.\n\nFun fact, Part 2: Bills fans will like this one. Buffalo pounded Cleveland 37-7 on Dec. 12, 2004, in a game where the Bills defense enjoyed a historic performance, limiting the Browns to only 26 total yards of offense, and minus-3 passing yards. Those are franchise records for fewest total yards of offense and passing yards allowed in a game, marks that may never be broken.\n\nThis was actually a game for the first quarter. Following a Nate Clements fumble on a punt return, Cleveland took over at the Buffalo 18-yard line and took a 7-3 yead on Luke McCown’s three-yard TD pass to Dennis Northcutt, but it was all Buffalo from there.\n\nThe Bills scored 34 unanswered points, fueled by a ground game that amassed 215 rushing yards, with Willis McGahee accounting for 105 yards and scoring on a pair of TD runs to fuel the offense. Buffalo won despite Drew Bledsoe completing only 12 of 27 passes for 100 yards, including a seven-yard TD to Lee Evans in the second quarter that gave the Bills the lead for good.\n\nMcCown and Jeff Garcia combined to complete nine of their 21 pass attempts for 67 yards with two interceptions, but Buffalo’s defense registered seven sacks for 70 yards in losses, leading to the minus-3 passing yard figure. Sam Adams led the way on the sack brigade with a pair of takedowns, while Chris Kelsay, Aaron Schobel, Lawyer Milloy, Jeff Posey and Troy Vincent each added sacks in the blowout. Vincent and Nate Clements each added interceptions as part of an impressive showing for the Bills.\n\nBuffalo’s run defense was equally impressive, limiting the Browns to 29 yards on 18 attempts as Cleveland had only six first downs.\n\nThe win was Buffalo’s fourth in a row during a run where the Bills would rattle off six straight wins before seeing their playoff chances dashed in a 29-24 home loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the regular season finale.\n\nThere are a total of 77 players who appeared in a game for both the Bills and Bills, including guard Joe DeLamielleure (1973-85 with the Bills, 1980-84 with the Browns), safety Jordan Poyer (2013-16 with the Browns, 2017-25 with the Bills), defensive tackle Ted Washington (1995-2000 with the Bills, 2006-07 with the Browns), and defensive back Donte Whitner (2006-10 with the Bills, 2014-15 with the Browns).\n\nAmong the other notable players with ties to both the Bills and Browns:\n\nPunter Corey Bojorquez (2018-20 with the Bills, 2022-25 with the Browns)\n\nTight end Mark Campbell (1999-2002 with the Browns, 2003-05 with the Bills)\n\nWide receiver Amari Cooper (2022-24 with the Browns, 2024 with the Bills)\n\nLinebacker Bo Cornell (1971-72 with the Browns, 1973-77 with the Bills)\n\nGuard Joe DeLamielleure (1973-85 with the Bills, 1980-84 with the Browns)\n\nDefensive lineman Earl Edwards (1973-75 with the Bills, 1976-78 with the Browns)\n\nQuarterback Kelly Holcomb (2001-04 with the Browns, 2005 with the Bills)\n\nDefensive back Lawrence Johnson (1979-84 with the Browns, 1985-87 with the Bills)\n\nDefensive back Ernie Kellermann (1966-71 with the Browns, 1973 with the Bills)\n\nRunning back Willis McGahee (2004-06 with the Bills, 2013 with the Browns)\n\nQuarterback Tommy O’Connell (1956-57 with the Browns, 1960-61 with the Bills)\n\nDefensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi (2017-20 with the Browns, 2025 with the Bills)\n\nDefensive back John Pitts (1967-73 with the Bills, 1975 with the Browns)\n\nSafety Jordan Poyer (2013-16 with the Browns, 2017-2025 with the Bills)\n\nLinebacker Lucius Sanford (1978-86 with the Bills, 1987 with the Browns)\n\nQuarterback Tyrod Taylor (2015-17 with the Bills, 2018 with the Browns)\n\nGuard Wyatt Teller (2018 with the Bills, 2019-25 with the Browns)\n\nDefensive tackle Ted Washington (1995-2000 with the Bills, 2006-07 with the Browns)\n\nDefensive back Donte Whitner (2006-10 with the Bills, 2014-15 with the Browns)\n\nFun fact: There have been seven players to throw a pass in both a Bills and Browns uniform:\n\nDerek Anderson\nKelly Holcomb\nCase Keenum\nThad Lewis\nDave Mays\nTommy O’Connell\nTyrod Taylor",

    "fullText": "Wales hooker Dewi Lake returns to captain Ospreys for the United Rugby Championship (URC) home match against Munster in Bridgend on Saturday.\n\nLake and flanker Jac Morgan, who are out of contract with Ospreys after this season, have this week announced they will join Gloucester at the end of the 2025-26 campaign.\n\nLake, 26, has not played since leading Wales in the 73-0 defeat against South Africa last month.\n\nOspreys head coach Mark Jones has praised Lake's attitude surrounding his move.\n\n\"His professionalism around the club has been very good,\" said Jones.\n\n\"You wouldn't have known there's anything going on. That's the same for all of the group, not just those two lads [Lake and Morgan].\n\n\"They've handled it well and been upfront.\"\n\nOspreys also welcome back Wales internationals Dan Edwards, Reuben Morgan-Williams, Rhys Davies, James Ratti and Harri Deaves, while Owen Watkin and Morgan Morris make their first starts after long-term injury.\n\n\"There's definitely some healthier bodies coming back in and keeping my head frying around selection,\" said Jones.\n\n\"We've got quite a few guys in certain positions playing well.\"\n\nMunster, who lie in third, have made six personnel changes and two positional switches to the side which secured a Champions Cup bonus-point win against Gloucester.\n\nJeremy Loughman, Fineen Wycherley, Alex Kendellen, Paddy Patterson, Tom Farrell and Calvin Nash all come into the starting side.\n\nOspreys have virtually confirmed their place in the Challenge Cup knockout stages following pool victories against Connacht and Montauban.\n\nIn contrast, Jones' side lie 13th in the URC table having won just one game from six this campaign.\n\n\"While we haven't picked up as many wins as we'd like in the URC, these performances have been coming,\" said Jones.\n\n\"We've shown we're a very good team, but haven't done it often enough in games. We've been in a great shout of winning games.\n\n\"The signs have been positives and we've taken some key steps forward.\"\n\nIt is an uncertain time in the domestic game in Wales, with the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) proposing to cut one of its four men's professional sides.\n\nWelsh rugby's governing body has said it proposes to grant three licences for men's professional clubs.\n\nThere will be one in Cardiff, one in the east and one in the west, which could result in a survival fight between Swansea-based Ospreys and Scarlets in Llanelli.\n\nOspreys owners, Y11 Sport & Media, have also been linked with taking over WRU-owned Cardiff, which is another way the governing body could get its wish of losing a side.\n\n\"When you boil it all back and put everything to one side, all we can control as people is how we do our jobs, whether that's player, coach or whoever,\" said Jones.\n\n\"Just do your best for the badge. If you do that, you'll make sure whatever you're doing is done to a high level.\n\n\"The way our players have put things to one side and focused energy into preparing the team well has been top-notch.\"\n\nOspreys boss Jones hopes Morgan and Lake return\n\nWhy are Wales' captains leaving for England?\n\nWelsh pair Morse and Deaves sign new Ospreys deals\n\nOspreys: Nagy; Kasende, Boshoff, Watkin, Giles; Edwards, Morgan-Williams: S Thomas, Lake (capt), Henry, R Davies, Smith, Ratti, Deaves, M Morris.\n\nReplacements: Parry, C Jones, Botha, Sutton, Morse, Hardy, K Williams, Walsh.\n\nMunster: Haley; Nash, T Farrell, Nankivell, Daly; Crowley, Patterson; Loughman, Scannell, Ala'alatoa, Kleyn, Wycherley, O'Donoghue (capt), Kendellen, Coombes.\n\nReplacements: Barron, Milne, Bartley, Edogbo, Ahern, Coughlan, Hanrahan, Hodnett.\n\nAssistants: Craig Evans & Andrew Moule (WRU)",

    "description": "The surprising complexity behind asking users for microphone permission on the Web",
    "fullText": "The surprising complexity behind asking users for microphone permission on the Web\n\nWhile building Ramble , we needed to handle microphone access for voice input. The logic started as a few lines directly inside the component—call getUserMedia to request permission and get an audio stream, done. But as we kept running into browser quirks and edge cases, it grew complex enough that we extracted it into a dedicated hook called useMicrophone.\n\nThis write-up covers the interesting challenges involved: handling permissions across different browsers, enumerating and selecting microphone devices, persisting user preferences across sessions, and managing media streams without leaking resources.\n\nThe browser permission model looks straightforward until you actually use it. We ended up with five distinct states:\n\nWhy so many? Because “denied” and “no microphone” require completely different UI and messaging. And undefined lets us distinguish “still loading” from 'prompt' which means “ready to ask the user”, so we know when to show loading states versus the actual permission request button.\n\nThe trickiest part was Chromium’s permission prompt. When a user dismisses the prompt (clicks outside it or presses Escape), getUserMedia throws a NotAllowedError. The same error you get when they explicitly click “Block.” 🤨\n\nThe only way to tell them apart is to query navigator.permissions after the error. If it returns 'prompt', they dismissed it. If it returns 'denied', they blocked it. Firefox doesn’t have this quirk, so we only apply this logic on Chromium browsers.\n\nFirefox has its own quirk. When a user temporarily blocks access, the permission API might still return 'prompt' instead of 'denied'. So we can’t always tell if permission was never requested or just temporarily denied. We accept this ambiguity rather than trigger an unsolicited prompt to find out.\n\nOne firm requirement: never trigger a permission prompt on page load. Users should explicitly initiate the request. So on mount, we silently check the current permission state through navigator.permissions.query() without prompting. Only when the user clicks a button that requires microphone access do we call getUserMedia, which triggers the browser’s permission dialog.\n\nOnce we had permissions sorted, we needed device enumeration. This is where Windows threw us a curveball 🫠\n\nCalling navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices() on Windows returns devices with IDs like 'default' and 'communications'. These aren’t real microphones. They’re system aliases that duplicate actual devices in the list. We filter them out to avoid confusing users with duplicate entries.\n\nBut here’s another gotcha: the first device in the enumerated list isn’t necessarily the system default. The browser returns devices in an arbitrary order. To find the actual default, we create a temporary stream with getUserMedia({ audio: true }), check which device it picked, then immediately stop the stream. A bit wasteful, but it’s the only reliable way.\n\nWe then reorder our device list to put the real default first. Users expect the top option to be their system default, and now it actually is.\n\nUsers who pick a microphone other than the default don’t want to re-select it every time they open Ramble. Persistence seemed simple: store the device ID in localStorage, restore it on load.\n\nExcept device IDs aren’t stable. Browsers can regenerate them. Plugging a device into a different USB port might change it. Even browser updates can shuffle them around.\n\nLabels are more reliable. A “Blue Yeti” is still called “Blue Yeti” regardless of which port it’s in. So we store the label instead of the ID.\n\nBut labels have their own quirks. Chrome loves appending technical suffixes:\n\nWe clean these before storing and comparing. A simple regex strips hex IDs, (Default) markers, and numeric suffixes:\n\nEven with clean labels, exact matching isn’t enough. A browser update might slightly change how a device is named. So we implemented fuzzy matching: exact match first, then case-insensitive, then word-based similarity scoring. If at least 50% of words match, we consider it the same device.\n\nIs this overkill? Maybe 🫣 But it means users almost never lose their preference, even when the underlying system changes slightly.\n\nMedia streams are resources. Leave them running and you get the recording indicator stuck on, battery drain, and potentially blocked access for other apps. We needed careful lifecycle management.\n\nThe main challenge is race conditions. Users can switch devices quickly. Each switch triggers a getUserMedia call. If a user switches three times rapidly, we might have three in-flight requests. The last one should win, but we can’t just ignore the others. Those streams need to be stopped.\n\nWe use an AbortController pattern. Each device switch creates a new controller. If the effect re-runs before getUserMedia resolves, we abort. When the promise resolves, we check if we were aborted. If so, we immediately stop the new stream’s tracks and bail out.\n\nOn unmount, we stop all tracks in the current stream. No orphaned streams, no stuck indicators.\n\nNone of this was planned. Each section of this write-up represents a problem we discovered only after hitting it. The permission quirks, the Windows device aliases, the label instability—all surprises.\n\nThe Chromium dismissed-vs-denied issue was particularly frustrating. The error looked the same, the behavior was different, and the only way to tell them apart was querying navigator.permissions after the fact. Not intuitive, but it seems to work.\n\nThe hook now handles all of this so components don’t have to think about it. Ramble uses it today, but it’s generic enough that we can use it for any feature that needs a microphone.",

    "fullText": "STATESVILLE, N.C. (AP) — A business jet crashed Thursday while trying to return to a North Carolina airport shortly after takeoff, killing all seven people aboard, including retired NASCAR driver Greg Biffle and his family, authorities said.\n\nThe Cessna C550 erupted into a large fire when it hit the ground. It had departed Statesville Regional Airport, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of Charlotte, but soon crashed while trying to return and land, the North Carolina State Highway Patrol said.\n\nFlight records show the plane was registered to a company run by Biffle. The cause of the crash wasn't immediately known, nor was the reason for the plane's return to the airport in drizzle and cloudy conditions.\n\nFederal Aviation Administration records show Biffle was rated to fly helicopters and single and multi-engine planes. It wasn't clear if Biffle was piloting the plane at the time of the crash.\n\nBiffle was on the plane with his wife, Cristina, and children Ryder, 5, and Emma, 14, according to the highway patrol and a family statement. Others on the plane were identified as Dennis Dutton, his son Jack, and Craig Wadsworth.\n\n“Each of them meant everything to us, and their absence leaves an immeasurable void in our lives,” the joint family statement said.\n\nBiffle, 55, won more than 50 races across NASCAR’s three circuits, including 19 at the Cup Series level. He also won the Trucks Series championship in 2000 and the Xfinity Series title in 2002.\n\nNASCAR said it was devastated by the news.\n\n“Greg was more than a champion driver; he was a beloved member of the NASCAR community, a fierce competitor, and a friend to so many,” NASCAR said. “His passion for racing, his integrity, and his commitment to fans and fellow competitors alike made a lasting impact on the sport.”\n\nThe plane, bound for Florida, took off from the Statesville airport shortly after 10 a.m., according to tracking data posted by FlightAware.com.\n\nGolfers playing next to the airport were shocked as they witnessed the disaster, even dropping to the ground at the Lakewood Golf Club while the plane was overhead. The ninth hole was covered with debris.\n\n“We were like, ‘Oh my gosh! That’s way too low,’” said Joshua Green of Mooresville. “It was scary.”\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration were investigating.\n\nThe Cessna plane, built in 1981, is a popular mid-sized business jet with an excellent reputation, aviation safety expert Jeff Guzzetti said. It has two engines and typically seats six to eight passengers and two pilots.\n\nIn 2024, Biffle was honored for his humanitarian efforts after Hurricane Helene struck the U.S., even using his personal helicopter to deliver aid to flooded, remote western North Carolina.\n\n“The last time I spoke with Cristina, just a couple of weeks ago, she reached out to ask how she could help with relief efforts in Jamaica. That’s who the Biffles were,\" U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, a Republican from North Carolina, said.\n\nWadsworth was Biffle's friend and helped him with odd jobs, including delivering supplies to places hit by Hurricane Helene, roommate Benito Howell said.\n\n“He didn’t know how to say no,” Howell said of Wadsworth, who had worked for several NASCAR teams. “He loved everybody. He always tried to help everybody.”\n\nThe joint family statement also spoke about Dutton and his son Jack, saying they were \"deeply loved as well, and their loss is felt by all who knew them.\"\n\nWith 2025 almost over, there have been 1,331 U.S. crashes this year investigated by the NTSB, from two-seat planes to commercial aircraft, compared to a total of 1,482 in 2024.\n\nMajor air disasters around the world in 2025 include the plane-helicopter collision that killed 67 in Washington, the Air India crash that killed 260 in India, and a crash in Russia’s Far East that claimed 48 lives. Fourteen people, including 11 on the ground, died in a UPS cargo plane crash in Kentucky.\n\nRobertson reported from Raleigh, North Carolina.

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Dec 18 (Reuters) - China on Thursday split off a Belgium-sized island with an economy comparable to a mid-sized country from the mainland for customs processing, part of a bid to join a major trans-Pacific trade deal and establish ​a new Hong Kong-style commercial hub.\n\nOfficials hope that turning the southern province of Hainan into a duty-free zone will spur foreign investment, ‌with goods that achieve at least 30% local value add able to move on into the world's second-largest economy tariff-free. Foreign firms will also be able to operate in service ‌sectors that are restricted on the mainland.\n\nChina is also seeking to boost its free-trade credentials to convince members of one of the world's largest free-trade deals, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), that it can meet the bloc's high standards for trade and investment openness through pilot projects such as the Hainan Free Trade Port.\n\n\"China aims to build the Hainan Free Trade Port into an important gateway that leads the country's opening-up into a new era,\" ⁠an editorial by the state news agency Xinhua said.\n\n\"It ‌is also expected to provide a huge boost for free trade that has been impacted by rising protectionism and unilateralism in recent years,\" the article added, in a veiled swipe at U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, which have pushed ‍policymakers to diversify China's $19 trillion economy from the world's top consumer market and take steps to further consolidate the manufacturing juggernaut's role in global supply chains.\n\nChina's leaders have made reversing a drop in investment a priority for next year, seeking to shift the economy from its current reliance on stimulus toward a dual focus on ​consumption and investment to stabilise growth in the near-term, while officials evaluate undertaking painful structural reforms needed to rebalance the economy long-term.\n\nForeign direct ‌investment into China fell 10.4% year-on-year in the first three quarters of 2025, official data shows.\n\nIf liberalisation succeeds in Hainan, economists say policymakers may feel emboldened to expose more of China's economy to market forces.\n\n\"The benchmark is something similar to Hong Kong,\" said Ran Guo, director for Consumer Economy at the China-Britain Business Council, who has been tracking the plan's developments for the past five years.\n\n\"In addition to boosting Hainan's tourism sector, the plan should also encourage more foreign investment and manufacturing,\" she added.",

    "fullText": "When I started to listen to the much-hyped new podcast from Katie Miller, I’d hoped to learn something, anything, to justify the many irreplaceable hours of my life I had already committed to it. I wanted a salacious tidbit or quote from one of the nearly 20 episodes that have dropped since August. I wanted moments that might help me understand the kind of person who would be married to Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff and architect of many of the Trump administration’s harshest and darkest policies.\n\nI did not get any of these things. The podcast, I’m afraid, is eye-wateringly boring—void of a single revelatory moment. House Speaker Mike Johnson is asked why he recently changed his style of glasses. Vice President J.D. Vance is asked to settle a debate as to whether a hot dog can be considered a sandwich. “Secretary of War” Pete Hegseth, appearing alongside his wife, is asked whether he prefers drumsticks, flats, or boneless wings. Sen. Katie Britt is asked how she passes time on airplanes. (Spoiler: she works.) And on it goes with Elon Musk, with “MAHA” influencer Vani Hari aka “Food Babe,” with actress Cheryl Hines, who is married to RFK Jr., and even with Attorney General Pam Bondi. Miller has access to a who’s who of high-profile MAGA figures, and she uses that time to ask them the most banal questions imaginable.\n\nSo that’s it? Skip the podcast and close this tab? Not so fast.\n\nYes, the podcast is dull in the extreme, and it seems to hinge in part on a bizarre assumption that the public is desperate for an inside glimpse of these people’s lives, in the vein of “Stars: They’re just like us.” But there’s something fascinating about it too: a bigger project with massive political and cultural ambitions, and one that we can’t afford to ignore. And the key to understanding that project is understanding Miller herself—where she came from and where she wants to go. In between listening to episodes of the show, I was talking to people who knew Miller growing up in Florida, and that’s when it all started to make more sense.\n\nAt a time when the military is bombing Venezuelan boats, National Guard troops are patrolling the streets of Washington, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are snatching parents off the streets in front of their children, Miller’s podcast—and her persona—is aimed at adding a patina of softness over a hard-right policy agenda. Surely the administration could not be as extreme or evil or fascist as its critics say if its members are chatting casually about raising their own children and picking new eyewear. The obvious audience for the podcast is white women, considered a swing demographic. (They favored Donald Trump by 4 points in 2024, according to Pew research, while white men went for Trump over Kamala Harris by a full 20 points. The divide is even larger among young women: Miller shared a graphic on her X account showing the widening partisan gulf between young men and women. “We aren’t talking to conservative women,” she wrote.)\n\nSo Miller announced her podcast in a video shared to X in August. In the video, Miller sits cross-legged in a gray armchair, wearing jeans and a white tank top, surrounded by soft lamps and plants, a copy of The Great Gatsby peeking out from a bookshelf behind her. “As a mom of three kids, who eats healthy, goes to the gym, works full time, I know there isn’t a podcast for women like myself,” Miller tells the camera. Bringing white women closer in line to their male counterparts would sharply reorient our politics and, if durable, could lead to something that looks like a permanent MAGA majority.\n\nOn some level, Miller is a strange choice for America’s trad-wife in chief. She married Stephen in 2020 at the Trump International Hotel, with the president himself in attendance. She too was a political player: She fell in love with Stephen over family-separation policies while she was working as a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security. (During her tenure at DHS, officials sent her to the southern border in the hopes that what she saw there might make her a little more compassionate. By her own telling, speaking to journalist Jacob Soboroff, “it didn’t work.”) Following her stint at DHS, she joined Vice President Mike Pence’s office as a spokesperson, later making it clear where her loyalties lay amid the bitter fallout between Pence and Trump over the Capitol riot. Earlier this year, she worked for DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, under Musk.\n\nAnd so Miller’s new position—in which she emphasizes her role as a wife and mother to three young children—has entailed a bit of a rebrand, shedding the image of a government attack dog in favor of a softer archetype. “When society told women that our value was derived from our ability to make an income instead of derived from the joy of motherhood we all failed,” Miller wrote online in October. “Make babies. Raise those babies. It’s our highest and best value.”\n\nWhen I started talking to people who knew Miller before she was a retrofitted, would-be MAGA icon—before she ever met Donald Trump—they described a person with some altogether different ambitions. Through their eyes, the entire public project of the Millers takes on added dimensions. And it all helps explain why, if you look closely, it’s clear something has gone awry with the fantasy Katie Miller is trying to sell.\n\nBefore she was the bride of Stephen Miller, Katie Miller was 15-year-old Katie Waldman, attending the first debate class for the 10th grade of Cypress Bay High School, in Broward County, Florida. During the class, which was held in a portable trailer due to overcrowding, students were tasked with a graded assignment to give a short speech about themselves.\n\nMiller’s address was particularly memorable: “She got up and said, ‘My father is a litigator, and my mom is a MILF. She does nothing but drive up and down the highway in her SUV until it’s time to pick me up from school,’ ” one former classmate told me. “What she meant was, ‘My dad is a rich guy, and my mom’s hot. That’s who I am, and that’s where I come from.’ She was super proud.”\n\nMiller was raised in Weston, a suburban fever dream spread across 10,500 acres of what, before being drained for development, was once Everglades wetland. Weston was built by Arvida, the same company that designed Disney World and Celebration, the Disney-owned planned community. It’s meticulously organized perfection: Its various neighborhoods, gated communities, parks, and street are pristine and feature shallow lagoons and golf courses, palm trees and hibiscus, blue skies and backyard swimming pools. One comparison kept coming up when I interviewed people for this story: It was like The Stepford Wives, a place where rich dads go to work and hot moms pick up the kids in nice cars.\n\nWeston was developed all at once in the 1990s and quickly cemented a reputation as a haven for “white flight,” only instead of white people fleeing Black people in inner cities, they were escaping the influx of immigration from Latino and Caribbean countries into Miami. In an interview with the Washington Post in 1998, Weston’s developers described the new suburb as “Our Home Town.” “It’s more like America,” one of them said.\n\nGlenn J. Waldman and his wife, Sheryl, left their 2,000-square-foot home in northern Miami in 1994, after their daughter Katie was born, and bought a property in the neighborhood of Weston Hills, one of the most prestigious gated communities in Weston, where homes are painted in mandatory hues such as Champagne Dance and Grandma’s Linen. The Waldmans, who are Jewish, had three children in total, and Katie was the middle. Glenn Waldman was a longtime donor to Republican lawmakers, bucking the overwhelming liberal slant in Weston, which is currently represented in Congress by Democrat Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\n\nAs for Miller, former classmates remember her as having broadly conservative politics, but they say she was fairly liberal on social issues. Ryan Terrell was the captain of the debate team at Cypress Bay High School and coached her in debate for a semester. Terrell was one of the few openly gay kids at Cypress Bay. “When she got married to Stephen Miller and got more involved in conservative circles, I thought it was interesting, because we had this whole social culture-war issue and I never saw Katie advocating for banning it,” Terrell said. “We had political discussions back then, and she never seemed to be homophobic or having issues with the LGBTQ community.”\n\nMiller was popular in the sense that she was part of a clique and had social status, but her former classmates said that popularity shouldn’t be confused with being well liked. “She was someone who was very interested in befriending others for status, more so than being a friend,” one classmate recalled. “She would drift towards whoever was in control or popular or whatever. A friend to many, but not really a good friend to any.” Former classmates remember her as wearing Juicy Couture tracksuits over a white top, poker-straight hair tied up in a ponytail. “She was very Valley Girl–ish,” Terrell said, “a teenage girl from an upper-income family in a wealthy neighborhood. She kind of talked like that, just without the California accent.”\n\nShe worked as a photo editor for the award-winning student newspaper the Circuit, which was featured in an MTV reality show, The Paper. She left there with plenty of critics: “You’re never surprised when you hear about something bad that Katie Waldman did,” said Emmi Weiner, who was an entertainment editor at the Circuit.\n\nMiller was apparently happy to court controversy even as a teen. A 2020 feature in Vanity Fair about the Millers’ engagement resurfaced an incident involving Katie and a widely respected English teacher, Simone Waite—one of the school’s few Black faculty members. Waite had been teaching Toni Morrison’s Beloved, which provoked discussions about slavery. When Waite said that one of the many sins of slavery was that it erased Black people of their history, Miller objected. “Couldn’t they just tell each other about their history?” she asked, according to the Vanity Fair report. She wouldn’t let it go and, after Waite suggested they “agree to disagree,” left the class and drafted a petition accusing Waite of psychological damage, calling the teacher “sickening.” The issue was eventually resolved following a meeting involving Miller, her father, and Waite—during which they agreed to take Miller out of the class.\n\nThe world that shaped Miller’s early years was one of suburban perfection and sheltered artifice, a nostalgic ideal so far removed from reality that it shares a developer with Disney World. In many ways, it’s a fantasy that’s not far from the promises of MAGA.\n\nAug. 11, 2025, was a difficult day to soften the Trump administration’s rough edges. It was the same day that the president announced a de facto takeover of law enforcement in the District of Columbia, complete with National Guard troops in the streets and armored vehicles parked in front of Union Station. Although executed under the auspices of fighting “rising crime,” despite violent crime rates having decreased in D.C. since 2023, the maneuver also functioned as a declaration of MAGA dominance over a blue city.\n\nAug. 11 was also the airdate of Miller’s podcast’s first episode, featuring none other than Vice President J.D. Vance. The lighting in the video version was soft, and the topic was domestic bliss. Vance, an unapologetic apostle of Trump’s far-right agenda, spent much of the 45-minute interview playing a jolly sitcom dad who impersonates an “ogre” at Disneyland, makes cheesecake on weekends, and insists upon the whole family gathering for dinner at the dining table each night. Other topics mentioned included Vance’s fandom of Magic: The Gathering, his opinions on cargo shorts, his “dad icks,” his preferred memes, and his “secret to keeping his marriage solid.” (He and Usha read the same book and discuss it.)\n\nThe interview is utterly anodyne, a doddering exchange of pleasantries and carefully selected humanizing anecdotes. If you were to watch it in a vacuum, you’d have no sense of a country in a time of mass transformation. There’s no probing of Vance’s real views on domestic life, including his position that well-educated women who prioritize careers over starting families are choosing a “path to misery.”\n\nMiller likes to conclude her interviews by asking her subject which three people, living or dead, they’d invite to dinner. Vance’s answer: Isaac Newton, Abraham Lincoln, and Donald Trump.\n\nAfter Weston, Miller went to the University of Florida, her father’s alma mater, and pledged to the Alpha Omicron Pi sorority. She joined the ruling party of Florida’s student government, which presided over some 60,000 students, in an initial foray into politics that was, to say the least, eventful.\n\nBack then, Florida’s student government had a reputation of operating a little like an autocracy. The governing party—which has changed its name over the years but was known as the Unite Party at the time Miller joined—was ruled by the iron fists of privileged frat boys and sorority girls, who controlled the school’s spending and were tapped for access to the exclusive Florida Blue Key society. After graduation, they were funneled into elected office and law clerkships.\n\nMiller, typically seen on campus in the sorority girl’s uniform of Nike shorts and a sorority-branded raincoat, quickly established herself as a power player in this world and operated like a “henchman” for the ruling party, said one former student. Members of opposing parties in student government typically were collegial with one another, socializing together despite disagreements. Not Miller.\n\n“Katie’s a very tenacious, self-assured individual,” recalled Jordan Ball, who was a senator for the opposition party. “She looked down on people she didn’t agree with.” Another former member of the student government described Miller’s approach to politics as “tribal.” “Most people in student government would be cordial and nice and would try to work together,” they said. “I feel like it was Katie’s whole life. She took it all very personally.”\n\nMultiple people I spoke to said that the Unite Party, which was overwhelmingly white, had a pattern of punishing Black and Hispanic affinity groups financially if they didn’t rally behind them during campaigns. “It was an open secret, but it still seemed strange on the outside, like, Why are these groups kowtowing to sororities and frats which were mostly white?” recalled one former member of student government. “Those groups would end up endorsing a bunch of frat bros.” (In 2016 those claims were among the many grievances that drove the student-led #NotMySystem movement, which called out the elitist and even corrupt practices of majority student government.)\n\nIn 2012, her sophomore year, while serving on the rules and ethics committee of student government, Miller was embroiled in a scandal. The head football coach had endorsed a candidate from the opposition Students Party, and the Independent Florida Alligator, the college paper, ran a front-page story publicizing it. Two people—later revealed to be Miller and former Student Government President Pro Tempore Jason Tiemeier—were spotted dumping 268 copies of the newspaper on the eve of student elections.\n\n“Especially after stealing the newspapers, she had a reputation, not just with us, but throughout the whole school, of being unethical,” said Ford Dwyer, who was a senator for the opposition party. Some people who knew her told me that they were a little scared of her back then, pointing to what they saw as a vindictive streak. Despite this reputation, Miller continued to rise through the ranks of the Unite Party, acquiring more and more power and responsibility, including being appointed to chair the allocations committee.\n\nHer ascent after all this was the subject of numerous editorials in the Independent Florida Alligator, including one with the headline “Katie Waldman Should Resign.” “Sen. Katie Waldman’s appointment to the position of allocations chairwoman is an affront to the students of UF,” wrote Max Stein, who was part of the opposition party. “I do not question her qualifications, passion or work ethic. I question her ethical and moral fiber.”\n\nThe paper’s editorial board didn’t pull any punches either. “With the recommendation that Waldman head a committee, bad behavior is being rewarded and the corruption continues to seep deeper into the fabric” of student government, the board wrote.\n\nThe Unite Party went on the attack against the student newspaper. “They have thrown away journalist integrity,” candidate TJ Villamil said in a video posted to YouTube. “Misrepresenting facts, inaccurate quotes, and completely falsified stories are just some of the few ways they’ve attempted to skew my message to the voters.”\n\nAfter a tenure in the senate that was defined by scandal, Miller was not invited by party leadership to run for her seat again. Departing senators are typically invited to get up and give goodbye speeches, and Miller’s was, by all accounts, memorable. She was bitter about not being asked to run again and felt betrayed. She delivered a glowering, chaotic speech that was full of tacit threats. “The sense that everyone got was that they’d better all be careful or else, because she had information on them, and she better be respected because she had secrets that she might or might not reveal,” Dwyer recalled.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding party leadership’s decision to ultimately remove her from power in 2013 remain a mystery and were subject to much speculation and gossip, particularly as those leaders were seen as her closest friends. But Miller’s fiery speech also got people talking: “It left a very big impression,” Dwyer said. “I think she felt like a victim.”\n\nNarratives of victimhood, disenfranchisement, and persecution have been foundational to the collective identity of the MAGA movement. Trump has regularly cast himself as the ultimate martyr, routinely claiming that the system is rigged against him and his supporters by all manner of nefarious forces. “There has never been a president who was so evilly and illegally treated as I,” Trump declared after a New York judge scheduled sentencing for his criminal hush money conviction on Jan. 10, 10 days prior to his inauguration.\n\nAnd Trump’s disciples, including Katie Miller, insist they are being persecuted by the very same forces.\n\n“Victimhood is currency for women on the far right,” said Seyward Darby, author of Sisters in Hate: American Women on the Front Lines of White Nationalism. “Women in this space hide when they play the victim. They hide their complicity. They play the ‘I’m just a nice woman or wife or mother or all of the above’ card and suggest that criticism of them is unwarranted because of that. They try to make themselves untouchable.”\n\nMiller has played that card herself. During a panel appearance on Piers Morgan’s show this fall, she got into an argument with Turkish American commentator Cenk Uygur after he criticized her husband for lying. “Piers, quite frankly, I’m really sick and tired of this racist bigoted rhetoric that can come from people like you against my husband, against my family and my children,” Miller said in a raised voice. “I am raising Jewish children in this country.”\n\nShe continued: “You better check your citizenship application that everything was legal and correct,” she said. “Because you’ll be just like Ilhan Omar coming next.”\n\nAfter college, Miller rose quickly through the ranks of the Republican Party, working for senators and the first Trump administration, where she met her future husband. The pair married in 2020. During the Biden years, Miller served as a senior adviser for P2 Public Affairs, a firm linked to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. At the time that Miller joined the firm, DeSantis was Trump’s main competitor for the 2024 Republican nomination. “It was not lost on others in Mr. Trump’s circle that the Miller family seemed well hedged for any outcome,” a report in the New York Times noted. After Trump clinched victory in the 2024 election, Miller came aboard his transition team as the media contact for Health and Human Services nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. She told Politico that she had no plans to join the Trump administration and would remain at P2.\n\nThat soon changed. Elon Musk, who credited himself for Trump’s win, had become a near-constant fixture at Mar-a-Lago (much to the chagrin of Trump insiders) and was mapping out an expansive role for himself in the new administration. That role ended up being the head of the Department of Government Efficiency. The president wanted Miller involved. “Katie Miller will soon be joining DOGE!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “She has been a loyal supporter of mine for many years.” Miller became Musk’s henchwoman, and Musk regularly spent time at the Millers’ residence. When Trump and Musk’s relationship inevitably imploded—their high-profile breakup playing out over a string of caustic posts online—Miller reportedly demurred from taking sides, and even had plans at one point to continue working for Musk in his private projects after he left the government.\n\nShe never followed through with those plans. But she did have Musk on her podcast earlier this month. Though it’s a low bar, the Musk episode is perhaps the most compelling of the bunch. He’s without question her biggest-name guest, someone whose daily habits, internal life, and personal tastes could be of genuine interest to the viewer. They discuss a range of subjects, such as Musk’s frustration that fashion isn’t evolving quickly enough, his views on DOGE’s legacy, and A.I.\n\nBut before long, Miller’s interview style arrives to once again flatten the proceedings. “Cheeseburgers are amazing,” Musk declares at one point. “A genius invention.”\n\nThe paradox of many content creators in the womanosphere is that they promote traditional gender roles—telling women that their main priorities should be to take care of their families—all while pursuing lucrative careers of their own. Miller is no exception: She may be out of politics, but her own effort to ascend in the right-wing media complex is plenty ambitious.\n\n“There is an imperative on the far right that women, even ones who are successful in business, politics, or other worldly spaces, must be traditionally feminine and care about traditionally feminine things,” said Darby. “They must purport to believe that their highest calling is being a wife and mother. They must embrace that calling as not just a personal one but also one in service of a nationalist agenda. Katie Miller is playing her part—or trying, anyway.”\n\nThat part was on full display when Miller hosted Katie Britt, the 43-year-old Republican senator from Alabama. Britt is, by any standard, ambitious and accomplished. In 2022, at age 40, she became the youngest GOP woman elected to the Senate—and the first female senator from Alabama. She has a law degree, which she got while a mother to two young children. She was elected president of the student’s government association while at the University of Alabama. She was invited to deliver the GOP rebuttal to Joe Biden’s State of the Union last year—and did so from her kitchen, of all places. “This is where our family has tough conversations,” Britt said. “It’s where we hold each other’s hands and pray for God’s guidance.”\n\nBut the podcast episode with Miller seems to be an opportunity for Britt to downplay her ambition, to remind everyone that she’s a mom and a wife first and foremost. It’s filmed in Britt’s home, and the two women sit on white floral armchairs in a Southern-style sunroom. Britt is, by her own description, a “Patriot wife” because she’s married to Wesley Britt, whom she met at the University of Alabama and who was a tackle for three seasons for the New England Patriots.\n\nBritt tells Miller that her decision to run for Senate was a religious calling, and that when her son was 10 years old, he came to her and asked to speak privately. He then presented her with a list of reasons for why she needed to run. “I want people to know how much you love Jesus,” he told her. “I want them to know what a good mom you are.” Then he added: “Mom, I definitely think they need to know about your passion for small business.”\n\nMiller talks to Britt about her weekly schedule, which generally requires senators to be in D.C. Monday through Thursday. “Do you cook Sunday nights for family dinner?” Miller asks Britt. Britt stammers in response: “I don’t always—you know, yes, I cook Sunday nights for dinner, but I was about to say, I don’t always crush it.”\n\nThere is one more thing to know about Miller’s podcast, and that is that so far it’s a flop.\n\nThe podcast was supposed to be soft-lit counterprogramming to the second Trump administration’s daily horrors. And Miller keeps bagging major guests—veritable Trump-orbit superstars, such as Pete Hegseth and Mike Johnson and their spouses, to say nothing of Musk. And yet, despite it all, its numbers have flatlined. Most of her YouTube episodes get mired in the 10,000-view mark, with a couple of exceptions. (The Musk interview racked up half a million views.) At least for now, her metrics put her far behind the likes of other conservative women podcasters: Influencers like Brett Cooper, Pearl Davis, and Allie Beth Stuckey easily get hundreds of thousands of views on their YouTube videos. Unlike Miller, they’ve been toiling in the proverbial content mines for years, and they now have the audience to show for it.\n\n“Despite what she said when she launched the show, she isn’t filling a gap in the cultural space,” said Darby. “There is already plenty of content out there for MAGA moms.”\n\nIf I’ve learned anything about Miller through talking to the people who’ve known her throughout her life, it’s that she cannot be happy about all this. (Miller did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nWhere is she going wrong? Why, with her pick of MAGA world for a guest list, is Miller finding a relatively puny audience?\n\nIt’s hard to say for certain. As is probably clear by now, Miller herself is neither a particularly compelling interviewer nor one who produces the types of viral moments that political podcasts thrive on in the current era. But the project’s faults may run deeper than that. The podcast seems engineered around highlighting the softer side of this administration’s figures. And that task may be impossible for half of Miller’s potential audience and not desired by the other.\n\nFor right-leaning MAGA skeptics, who could be won over by Hegseth’s wing choices at a time when he’s reveling in obliterating small ships off the coast of Venezuela? Who’s going to believe that Bondi is an aggrieved figure at a time when her Justice Department is openly, proudly serving as Trump’s personal score-settler?\n\nAnd for the MAGA faithful, are they really looking for these figures to be softened? What about this movement, born of mass rage and now on a four-year vengeance tour, suggests that the base is looking for any sort of cover?\n\nIt is, after all, a podcast aimed at making MAGA approachable to the center—and in Trump’s America, it has long been clear that the center cannot hold.\n\nThe most recent episode of the podcast features FBI Director Kash Patel and his girlfriend, country-music artist Alexis Wilkins. It begins with the disclaimer that the episode was recorded prior to the mass shooting at Brown University that left two dead, nine injured, and the shooter at large. The episode is full of idle chatter: Wilkins explains that she’s had to change her posting habits since getting booed up with the head of the FBI. Patel defends using a private jet to go see her, and discloses their shared love of a “surf and turf” night of lobster and steak.\n\nOne viewer left a comment: “We are not a serious country.”",

    "fullText": "When Alex pulled into the garage after work two years ago, he didn’t expect a confession that would shake both his marriage and his family’s finances.\n\nHis wife, Jackie, a 33-year-old stay-at-home mother of four in North Dakota, told him she had secretly spent between $5,000 and $6,000 on a Tony Robbins-branded coaching program to their savings without telling him. The purchase couldn’t be refunded, and she wasn’t sure what, exactly, it would deliver.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nI’m almost 50 years old and have nothing saved for retirement. What do I do? Don’t panic. Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\n“It hurt really bad,” Alex told Ramit Sethi on I Will Teach You To Be Rich (1) “I was upset and emotionally affected by that for a while… for months.”\n\nFor Jackie, the purchase felt less like business training and more like hope. Isolated, struggling with postpartum depression, and desperate to contribute financially, she bought into the promise of clarity and transformation. The aftermath pushed the couple into opposite corners. Jackie retreated into shame and secrecy.\n\nAlex responded with control, requiring her to text him before every purchase (even a $40 grocery run) while maintaining an exhaustive, color-coded spreadsheet tracking a decade of spending. The system didn’t fix their money problems, but it did deepen the tension. Here’s how they got into this situation and what finally helped them start digging out.\n\nIn Jackie and Alex’s case, the spending didn’t stop with the initial Robbins program. Within the following year, Jackie enrolled in a separate photography business course, this one costing about $15,000 to $16,000. While she earned some income afterward, the couple was left with roughly $9,000 in remaining debt, further cementing Alex’s sense that he couldn’t trust financial decisions made without full transparency.\n\nThat escalation is a textbook example of the sunk-cost fallacy (2). After investing thousands into the first program, Jackie felt pressure to make the spending “worth it” by doubling down and pursuing another course in hopes that the next one would finally deliver the income, clarity or breakthrough she was promised.\n\nBehavioral economists use the term sunk-cost fallacy to describe this pattern: people keep investing more time or money not because the next step makes sense, but because they’ve already spent so much. In this case, what began as a $5,000 secret purchase quietly snowballed into a five-figure financial setback.",

    "title": "Exclusive: Top lawyer for military joint chiefs told chairman that officers should retire if faced with an unlawful order",
    "description": "How should a military commander respond if they determine they have received an unlawful order?",
    "fullText": "How should a military commander respond if they determine they have received an unlawful order?\n\nRequest to retire — and refrain from resigning in protest, which could be seen as a political act, or picking a fight to get fired.\n\nThat was the previously unreported guidance that Brig. Gen. Eric Widmar, the top lawyer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, gave to the country’s top general, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, in November, according to sources familiar with the discussion.\n\nCaine had just seen a video that included six Democratic lawmakers publicly urging US troops to disobey illegal orders. He asked Widmar, according to the sources, what the latest guidance was on how to determine whether an order was lawful and how a commander should reply if it is not.\n\nWidmar responded that they should consult with their legal adviser if they’re unsure, the sources said. But ultimately, if they determine that an order is illegal, they should consider requesting retirement.\n\nThe guidance sheds new light on how top military officials are thinking about an issue that has reached a fever pitch in recent weeks, as lawmakers and legal experts have repeatedly questioned the legality of the US military’s counternarcotics operations in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean including intense scrutiny of a “double-tap” strike that deliberately killed survivors on September 2.\n\nCaine is not in the chain of command. But he is closely involved in operations, including those in SOUTHCOM, and is often tasked with presenting military options to the president—more so than Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, CNN has reported.\n\nThe Joint Staff declined to comment for this story.\n\nSeveral senior officers who reportedly expressed concerns about the boat strikes, including former US Southern Command commander Adm. Alvin Holsey and Lt. Gen. Joe McGee, the former director for Strategy, Plans, and Policy on the Joint Staff, have retired early in recent months.\n\nWidmar’s advice to Caine was meant to help inform the chairman’s discussions with senior military officials should the issue come up, the sources said. The Democrats’ video had become headline news, enraging Hegseth and sparking debates across the country.\n\nA separate official familiar with military legal advice said that it is not uncommon for lawyers to urge servicemembers to consider leaving the force if they believe they’re being asked to do something they are personally uncomfortable with, but it’s typically handled on a case-by-case basis and tailored to the facts of the situation.\n\nOther current and former US officials, however, including those who have served as miliary lawyers in the Judge Advocate General corps, stressed that broadly encouraging servicemembers to quietly retire — if they’re eligible — rather than voice dissent in the face of a potentially illegal order risks perpetuating a culture of silence and lack of accountability.\n\n“A commissioned officer has every right to say, ‘this is wrong,’ and shouldn’t be expected to quietly and silently walk away just because they’re given a free pass to do so,” said a former senior defense official who left the Pentagon earlier this year.\n\nMore than a dozen senior officers have either been fired or retired early since Trump took office in January, an unusually high rate of turnover. In a speech before hundreds of general and flag officers in September, Hegseth directed officers to “do the honorable thing and resign” if they didn’t agree with his vision for the department.\n\nBut disagreeing with the direction of the military is different than viewing an order as illegal, legal experts said.\n\nDan Maurer, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and former JAG lawyer, said that the guidance, as described by CNN, appears to “misunderstand what a servicemember is supposed to do in the face of an unlawful order: disobey it if confident that the order is unlawful and attempt to persuade the order-giver to stop or modify it have failed, and report it through the chain of command.”\n\nMaurer added that “if the guidance does not explicitly advise servicemembers that they have a duty to disobey unlawful orders, the guidance is not a legitimate statement of professional military ethics and the law.”\n\nWidmar advised that an order may be unlawful if it is “patently illegal,” or something an ordinary person would recognize instinctively as a violation of domestic or international law, the sources said — the My Lai massacre in Vietnam is an oft-used example. But the guidance he provided was that an unlawful order should be met with retirement, if possible, and did not note that servicemembers have a duty to disobey unlawful orders, the sources said.\n\n“It’s a very safe recommendation in this current political environment,” said the former senior defense official. “But that doesn’t make it the right or ethical one.”\n\nExperts on civil military relations have previously pointed to retirement as a reasonable option for officers who object to a particular policy, while noting that it comes with its own costs.\n\nIn a September article that has been discussed amongst the Joint Staff and other senior military officials, Peter Feaver, a political science professor at Duke University, and Heidi Urben, a former Army intelligence officer and current associate director of Georgetown University’s security studies program, wrote that “quiet quitting”, or opting for retirement “allows officers with professionally grounded objections to leave without posing a direct challenge to civilian control.”\n\nAnd while officers shouldn’t resign in protest or pick fights, they argued, they should “speak up” and “show moral courage” when the military’s professional values and ideals are at risk.\n\nAnd they should be willing to be fired for it. “Complete silence can be corrosive to good order and discipline and signal to the force that the military’s professional values and norms are expendable,” they wrote.\n\nMaurer, the former Army officer, said the advice to retire in the face of an unlawful order also functions to “keep that person silent in perpetuity, because as a retiree he or she remains subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which criminalizes a broad range of conduct and speech that would be constitutionally protected for regular civilians.”\n\nThose constraints have been apparent as the Pentagon has launched an investigation into Sen. Mark Kelly, a retired Navy captain and one of the Democratic lawmakers seen in the video encouraging troops to disobey unlawful orders, which prompted Caine to seek the legal advice.\n\nAs questions continue to swirl around the legality of the boat strike campaign, Widmar also advised Caine that Article II of the Constitution gives the president the authority to authorize lethal force to protect the nation, unless hostilities rise to the level of a full-blown war — in which case Congressional approval is required, the sources said.\n\nWhether the president’s orders are legal to begin with, Widmar advised according to the sources, is a question only the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel can answer, due to the executive order Trump issued in February that says the president and the attorney general’s “opinions on questions of law are controlling” on all executive branch employees — to include US troops.\n\nThe Office of Legal Counsel determined in September that it is legal for Trump to order strikes on suspected drug boats because they pose an imminent threat to the United States, CNN has reported.\n\nSince September 2, the US military has killed at least 99 people across dozens of strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, arguing that those targeted were “narcoterrorists” that pose a direct threat to the United States. The Trump administration has also not provided public evidence of the presence of narcotics on the boats struck, nor their affiliation with drug cartels.\n\nLawmakers have said that Pentagon officials have acknowledged in private briefings not knowing the identities of everyone on board a vessel before striking it; instead, military officials only need to confirm that the individuals are affiliated with a cartel or criminal organization to target them.\n\nSome members of Congress, legal experts and human rights groups have argued that potential drug traffickers are civilians who should not be summarily killed but arrested—something the Coast Guard did routinely, and continues to do in the eastern Pacific, when encountering a suspected drug trafficking vessel.\n\nCNN’s Haley Britzky contributed to this report",

    "description": "Enten warned that “in the minds of the American public” congressional Democrats “are lower than the Dead Sea.”",
    "fullText": "CNN data guru Harry Enten laughed out loud in disbelief during his review of a stark new poll that paints a grim picture for congressional Democrats, finding that they’ve hit their “lowest ever” net approval rating.\n\nRunning through the latest Quinnipiac polling on CNN Thursday with the data displayed on the big board in the studio, Enten opened to warn that “in the minds of the American public” Democrats “are lower than the Dead Sea.” For a party hoping to reclaim majorities in the 2026 midterms, he argued, the numbers read like a warning flare.\n\nGetting into the figures with network anchor Kate Bolduan, Enten said: “The net approval rating for Democrats in Congress? The lowest ever. Look at this! Overall, they are 55 points underwater. Their approval rating is south of 20%. It’s even worse when you look at independents. Look at this: -61 points! That means that their approval rating is 61 points lower than their disapproval rating!”\n\n“Quinnipiac has been polling this question for the better part of the 21st century,” he explained. “They have never found Democrats, at least those in Congress, and worse shape than they are right now.”\n\nHe continued to argue that what makes the situation more politically dangerous is that the collapse is not limited to swing voters. Democrats themselves have turned sharply against their own party in Congress.\n\n“This is Democrats on Democrats!” Enten said, flashing up another graphic which showed congressional Democrats’ ratings with their own party’s voters having dropped from +22 points in October to -6 in November.\n\n“That’s a 28-point decline!” he explained: “Falling through the floor!”\n\nThe shift, he added, marks a dramatic reversal from the autumn, when a government shutdown briefly gave Democrats a boost in a rally that has since evaporated.\n\n“Democrats did not like how that shutdown turned out,” Enten said, adding that the base has now “returned against Democrats in Congress.”\n\nThe immediate question, raised by Bolduan, is whether Democrats can still win control of Congress despite these numbers.\n\nEnten’s answer was cautious: “The answer is yes. But in my mind, it’s definitely hurting them.” He pointed to the generic congressional ballot, where Democrats currently lead by just 4 points.\n\n“Historically, that is quite weak,” he said, pointing to past cycles under Republican presidents when Democrats were ahead by around 10 points at a comparable stage.\n\nThe data analyst added that a lot of Democrats seem to think they can “spike that ball in the end zone,” but he warned that while the party might be on its way to a congressional majority, midterm success “might be a tougher road to hoe than normally.”\n\n“Especially if you see that change from October,” Bolduan said, letting out a stunned laugh also, before adding: “A lot can change.”\n\nEnten agreed, but with a caveat for Democrats: “When you have numbers like this, hold the phone just a second.”\n\nThe post ’55 Points Underwater!’ CNN’s Harry Enten Laughs in Shock as Congressional Dems Hit ‘Lowest Ever’ Ratings first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Federal regulators will allow tech companies to effectively plug massive data centers directly into power plants, issuing a long-awaited order Thursday, as the Trump administration urges it to help the U.S. lead the world in artificial intelligence and revive domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's unanimous order is designed to clear up pressing issues around so-called “colocation” agreements in the nation's largest grid territory, which stretches across mid-Atlantic states to parts of Illinois and Indiana.\n\nBut it could become a blueprint for how FERC handles an October request from Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, to ensure that data centers and large manufacturers get the power they need as quickly as possible.\n\nIt also comes amid concerns that the mid-Atlantic territory covering some 65 million people will face electricity shortages in the coming years, as the build out of data centers outpaces the speed of new power sources coming online.\n\nLaura Swett, FERC’s chair, told Thursday's meeting that clearing the way for massive energy users — like data centers — to get electricity straight from power plants was a “critical step to give investors and consumers more certainty on how FERC believes we can solve the problem of meeting historic surging demand and realize our greatest potential as a country.”\n\nIt would, she said, also protect regular ratepayers, even as evidence mounts in various states that regular ratepayers are bearing the cost of new power plants and transmission lines to feed energy hungry data centers.\n\nPower plant owners applauded the step, as their share prices rose steeply in Thursday's trading. Advanced Energy United, whose members provide solar and wind power, said the FERC order should help clarify how big power users can set up their own power sources.\n\nThe Edison Electric Institute, which represents for-profit utilities, said only that it would “continue to work” to support rapid data center connection, protect ratepayers from cost-shifts and strengthen the grid for everyone.\n\nJeff Dennis, executive director of the Electricity Customer Alliance, said the order showed that FERC is trying to address looming issues around fast-growing power demand and underscored the urgency to reform grid policy.\n\nThursday's order grew out of a dispute between power plant owners and electric utilities over a proposed colocation deal between Amazon’s cloud-computing subsidiary and the owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.\n\nFor tech giants, such arrangements represent a quick fix to quickly get power while avoiding a potentially longer and more expensive process of hooking into a fraying electric grid that serves everyone else.\n\nBut utilities protested that it allows big power users to avoid paying them to maintain the grid. Some consumer advocates maintained that diverting energy from existing power plants to data centers could drive up energy prices without an answer for how rising power demand will be met for regular ratepayers.\n\nFERC's Thursday order sets up a couple new regulatory tracks.\n\nIt requires the operator of the mid-Atlantic grid, PJM Interconnection, to develop rates and conditions for different colocation scenarios involving new power plants or sources.\n\nThat could mean allowing a big power user to pay for only the transmission services they use, considerably less than they might otherwise pay to connect to the grid through a utility.\n\nThe order also could require a big power user that colocates with an existing power plant to pay the cost to replace the energy that it diverts away from the broader electric grid.\n\nFollow Marc Levy on X at https://x.com/timelywriter.",

    "title": "Brad Lander on What It Takes to Win as a Progressive",
    "description": "Bhaskar...",
    "fullText": "The outgoing New York City comptroller discusses governing on the left, his run for Congress, and why housing and affordability should define the next Democratic fight.\n\nBrad Lander is leaving his post as New York City comptroller and running for Congress in New York’s 10th District, which includes parts of Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan. A longtime progressive, Lander recently mounted a mayoral bid that finished third in the Democratic primary—but under ranked-choice voting, his cross-endorsement and campaigning alongside Zohran Mamdani helped consolidate progressive support and proved pivotal to Mamdani’s victory.\n\nIn conversation with Nation president Bhaskar Sunkara, Lander reflects on that race, his years as the city’s chief fiscal watchdog, and the relationship between movement pressure and governing power.\n\nBhaskar Sunkara: You spent over a decade in the City Council. When you look back now, what do you see as the through line of your work during that period that most shaped how you view politics?\n\nBrad Lander: You can fight harder, win more, and build a broader coalition when you approach politics as a team sport. When I joined the City Council, we teamed up with the Working Families Party and other allies to create the Progressive Caucus—to bring in the workers, tenants, and community leaders that did not previously have a home in the Council to partner in campaigns for dignity for all New Yorkers. And we did well. We banned stop-and-frisk and strengthened protections for tenants against eviction. We became the first city in the country to guarantee a living wage for Uber drivers and deliveristas, stable schedules for fast food and retail workers, and strong protections for freelancers from wage theft. We desegregated the middle schools of Brooklyn’s District 15 and brought participatory budgeting to New York City.\n\nAll of those campaigns were won by “inside/outside” coalitions. They won meaningful material gains, so they built trust and strength for the next fight, and for more genuinely participatory democracy.\n\nBS: Did your time as comptroller change how you think about budgeting and public management and about the practical limits of what progressive governance can do within those constraints?\n\nBL: Serving as comptroller reinforced for me that good progressive governance depends on getting the fundamentals right. The constraints—financial, legal, administrative, personnel—also turn out to be the tools. The nuts and bolts of government, constructed through contracts, public finance, and labor agreements are what actually hold up our schools and subways, public hospitals and housing and services. So you have to really understand how they work, in order to put them together in new ways. Take the pension funds: We grew New York City’s funds to over $300 billion, while divesting fossil fuels and pushing our portfolio companies and asset managers hard on decarbonization, saving 35,000 rent-stabilized apartments through an innovative investment to buy the mortgages on them when Signature Bank failed, and helping tens of thousands of workers win union contracts through neutrality agreements that we insisted on as investors. There are, of course, limits to what you can do, but we so rarely test them.\n\nBS: We last spoke when you were just launching your mayoral run. Tell me about some of the lessons you drew from that race and if there’s something, at either an ideological or practical level, that’s informing how you’re approaching this congressional campaign?\n\nBL: Obviously, the mayoral race didn’t go quite like I planned it! But I feel really proud of the campaign we ran. The cross-endorsement of Zohran not only helped defeat Andrew Cuomo; it also opened up a deep well of solidarity—that politics can be a team sport to win for our values, and also that Muslim and Jewish New Yorkers can organize together. When I was arrested by ICE agents while trying to accompany neighbors seeking asylum, it was as part of a team of organizations bearing witness, in the tradition of nonviolent resistance. So we’ve been back again every week, and the movement to resist ICE and protect neighbors is growing in every corner of the city.\n\nOur democracy is precarious because people feel so precarious. They are constantly treading water, see that the system is rigged, and want bigger change. But our system isn’t delivering it. In moments of crisis, voters want leaders who understand the stakes and are willing to fight like our lives on the line. That’s how I’m approaching this campaign. I’ve spent my life organizing my neighbors to win big fights, from stopping evictions, to building new housing, desegregating our schools, and protecting immigrants from ICE. I recognize this moment, and I’m ready to meet it.\n\nBS: NY-10 spans working-class communities and very wealthy ones—people who experience the city in fundamentally different ways. What rises to the top for you as the district’s most immediate, everyday challenges?\n\nBL: Affordability and housing. It’s just a huge issue for families across the district, whether they’re in Red Hook or in Greenwich Village. These are neighborhoods people truly love, with little leagues and small businesses and schools and religious congregations that people treasure, but they don’t know how their kids will possibly be able to live here. This has been the work of my career. Fighting evictions and building affordable housing at the Fifth Avenue Committee, community planning and organizing for the Gowanus Neighborhood Rezoning, preserving or building over 50,000 affordable homes as comptroller.\n\nI’ll bring this expertise to Congress to help cities build housing people can actually afford, protect tenants, end homelessness, and fix public housing.\n\nBS: What federal interventions would make the most direct difference for renters and working families here?\n\nBL: We need to use every tool in our tool belt—and then construct some new tools as well.\n\nThat means combining the abundance agenda with a social housing agenda, as my Local Progress colleagues recently argued in The Nation. For example, federal housing, transportation, and infrastructure subsidies should also come along with requirements that municipalities eliminate restrictive and exclusion zoning, and with incentives to experiment with new housing models, so more housing gets built overall, and more inclusively—this is the idea of Senator Warren’s American Housing and Economic Mobility Act. Congress should repeal the Faircloth Amendment and work with cities and states to set up “public developers” to spark a new generation of experimentation. And the federal government should strengthen tenant protections—as we did creatively with the first-ever Responsible Property Management Standards adopted by a pension fund—because tenants shouldn’t be kicked out of their homes just because rents are rising in their community and because we won’t sustain support for growth if people believe they will be.\n\nBS: Dan Goldman votes with the Democratic caucus almost all of the time. What would you put forward that he hasn’t?\n\nBL: NY-10 voters want a representative who shares their urgency, and their values. They want a representative who will fight like our lives and our country are on the line, because they are. They don’t want a representative who is vacationing in the Bahamas in the same resort as Donald Trump Jr. during the government shutdown. They don’t want a representative trading stock to the tune of $10 million in industries he’s meant to oversee in Congress. They don’t want a representative who voted to censure Rashida Tlaib, but who views Randy Fine as a partner. They don’t want a representative who keeps voting to send 2,000-pound bombs to Netanyahu to continue the genocide in Gaza.\n\nThis district needs someone who actually represents them. I am a progressive Democrat, yes, and also a veteran lawmaker. I will organize with this community to protect our neighbors from ICE and fight fascism, and fight for an economy that isn’t rigged against working people. I will also use the experience I have from 12 years on the New York City Council and four years as City Comptroller to build coalitions across ideological differences. I know how to get work done and I will be laser focused on delivering for this district.\n\nThis district is full of people hungry to organize with their congressmember to protect neighbors from ICE and fight fascism, but also to fight for an economy that isn’t rigged against working people. I’ll offer bolder leadership, that’s out on the front lines organizing. As I did in the City Council, I’ll lead on workers’ rights and economic justice issues, including protecting freelancers and gig-workers who lack even basic protections or dignity.\n\nBS: What do you see as Congress’s role in pushing for peace and a Palestinian state?\n\nBL: For too long, US foreign policy leadership, including among Democrats, has failed to recognize and advance this clear truth: Israelis will only be safe and free when Palestinians are free and safe. Congress has an important oversight responsibility to ensure peace in the region and ensure that Palestinians and Israelis are each guaranteed security and sovereignty. That means Congress should stop supplying Israel with offensive weaponry contributing to the destruction of Gaza—which I recognize as a genocide, following most international human rights organizations, and after reading the works of Rafael Lemkin, a Polish Jew and Holocaust survivor who developed the term—and insist that Israel follow international law. We should recognize a Palestinian state, while insisting that it too follow international law and reject terrorism. For any of that, we must curb AIPAC’s outsized influence in our politics.\n\nMore broadly, I’ll fight for a new Democratic foreign policy vision that defends human rights and international norms, emphasizes global peacemaking over militarism, and defeats authoritarianism through multilateral alliances to combat inequality and poverty. New Yorkers’ hard-earned tax dollars should not be going to fund forever wars and human rights violations—whether by foreign leaders or American ones. I will push to rebuild USAID for a new era, to protect civilians from Ukraine to Sudan to Venezuela, and to roll back the imperial presidency, whichever party is in power, and restore Congress’s constitutional role to set foreign policy.\n\nBS: What does meaningful resistance to Trump look like?\n\nBL: We need a Democratic Party that is not afraid to fight Trump but also is actually committed to creating an economy that does not solely benefit corporate interests. A Democratic Party that is capable of projecting a vision for an economy where working people can thrive, where housing, health care, and childcare aren’t out of reach, and then actually delivering that for people A Democratic Party that can win in a wider range of places, which means trying a wider range of things. We need a Democratic Party that isn’t afraid of innovating, or of holding ourselves and our leadership accountable. We have to seize this moment. Trump is facing record low popularity and Americans are growing impatient with him on affordability. They believe he is going too far on immigration. We already have openings of resistance, and it requires Democrats moving with urgency to escalate the fight, propose new ideas, and be ready to deliver on them.\n\nBS: Even with Biden-era policy wins, Democrats still struggle with working-class voters. What do you think the party is getting wrong—and how would you argue for a different direction?\n\nBL: When heirs to corporate empires hold office, people rightly feel that the party is out of touch. Working class people have watched wealth continue to flow upward, watched corruption run rampant, watch prices grow faster than wages. Democrats need to call this out plainly and propose real, concrete solutions.\n\nI’ve spent decades delivering real economic wins. We won Universal Pre-K and 3K, paid sick leave, living wages and stable schedules for deliveristas, wage theft protections. When people see Democrats deliver on bread-and-butter issues—childcare, healthcare, housing, and better jobs—it rebuilds faith that the party is listening to them.\n\nIt also matters who the messengers are. We need a Democratic Party full of younger, working-class people who look like and represent their districts. I have worked hard to recruit and support young, diverse, working-class candidates, not only in New York City through WFP and the Progressive Caucus, like my City Council successor Shahana Hanif, but also through the national organization Local Progress that I helped to build along with Ady Barkan.\n\nBS: What’s your biggest regret from your council years?\n\nBL: While we made some progress in my City Council district by desegregating our middle schools and through the Gowanus Neighborhood Rezoning, where we conducted the first Racial Impact Study for a rezoning, but we fell short on broader policies to combat segregation. Two things I fought for but didn’t win: a bill banning co-op discrimination and a comprehensive planning framework that would further fair housing goals.\n\nBS: And what’s biggest regret as comptroller?\n\nBL: My last big swing is to get our pension funds to drop BlackRock, our biggest asset manager, because they are misaligned with our decarbonization plan. We’ve already divested fossil fuels and taken on big banks and utilities, but BlackRock has retreated in the face of Trump. So far, I haven’t been able to get a majority of the pension fund trustees to vote with me here.\n\nBS: What are you most proud of from your time on the City Council?\n\nBL: Desegregating the middle-schools of Community School District 15 in Brooklyn, the Gowanus Rezoning, and first-in-the-nation living wage and labor protection laws for deliveristas, Uber drivers, fast-food workers, and freelancers.\n\nBS: And how about as comptroller?\n\nBL: The investment that helped save 35,000 rent-stabilized apartments after the Signature Bank collapse. We stepped in to prevent those homes from being snapped up by speculators and preserved them as affordable housing. Every unit is preserved as rent stabilized and delivering strong returns for New York City’s retirees, too.\n\nBS: We’re in a moment of revived big ideas—from Trump’s national populism to Zohran’s democratic socialism. What’s your own larger vision for a just United States? What is “Landerism?”\n\nBL: Like I said in my campaign launch ad, it’s corny, but it’s a vision where democracy is understood as neighbors working together to make our lives in common better. Where Mr. Rogers takes on ICE, AIPAC, and corporate power to build a neighborhood that everyone can afford and where everyone is welcome. Practically, that means making a sharp critique of inequality, building a broad coalition around basic ideas of empathy, and getting into the weeds to make sure government actually delivers the goods.\n\nOver the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T. Klare, Katha Pollitt, Amy Littlefield, Gregg Gonsalves, and Sasha Abramsky take on the Trump family’s corruption, set the record straight about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s catastrophic Make America Healthy Again movement, survey the fallout and human cost of the DOGE wrecking ball, anticipate the Supreme Court’s dangerous antidemocratic rulings, and amplify successful tactics of resistance on the streets and in Congress.\n\nWe publish these stories because when members of our communities are being abducted, household debt is climbing, and AI data centers are causing water and electricity shortages, we have a duty as journalists to do all we can to inform the public.\n\nIn 2026, our aim is to do more than ever before—but we need your support to make that happen.\n\nThrough December 31, a generous donor will match all donations up to $75,000. That means that your contribution will be doubled, dollar for dollar. If we hit the full match, we’ll be starting 2026 with $150,000 to invest in the stories that impact real people’s lives—the kinds of stories that billionaire-owned, corporate-backed outlets aren’t covering.\n\nWith your support, our team will publish major stories that the president and his allies won’t want you to read. We’ll cover the emerging military-tech industrial complex and matters of war, peace, and surveillance, as well as the affordability crisis, hunger, housing, healthcare, the environment, attacks on reproductive rights, and much more. At the same time, we’ll imagine alternatives to Trumpian rule and uplift efforts to create a better world, here and now.\n\nWhile your gift has twice the impact, I’m asking you to support The Nation with a donation today. You’ll empower the journalists, editors, and fact-checkers best equipped to hold this authoritarian administration to account.\n\nI hope you won’t miss this moment—donate to The Nation today.\n\nEditor and publisher, The Nation",

Ford said total sales in the second quarter rose at a rate seven times that of the overall auto industry.\n\nIt sold 1.1 million units in the first six months, a 6.6% year-over-year increase.\n\nIn the third quarter, GM reported a 17% market share, its most substantial presence in the U.S. since 2017.\n\nHowever, while carmakers have failed to keep the same sales pace in the fourth quarter, they have been able to increase sales from last year, with one U.S. original equipment manufacturer taking home the 2025 sales crown.\n\nThe U.S. car industry is limping to the finish line as car buyers have failed to keep up the torrid purchase pace from earlier this year.\n\nWhile new vehicle sales in December are expected to show an uptick from the previous months, the December seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales is expected to finish near 15.9 million, down from last year's 16.8 million pace but up from November's 15.6 million pace.\n\nGM: 2.83 million vehicles (+5.1% yoy); 17.3% market share\n\nToyota: 2.52 million vehicles (+8.4% yoy); 15.5% market share\n\nFord: 2.18 million vehicles (+5.6% yoy); 13.4% market share\n\nHyundai: 1.84 million vehicles (+7.9% yoy); 11.3% market share\n\nHonda: 1.42 million vehicles (+0.6% yoy); 8.8% market share\n\nGeneral Motors is forecast to end the fourth quarter with over 685,000 vehicles sold, an 8.7% year-over-year decline, giving it the 2025 sales crown with more than 2.8 million vehicles sold this year.\n\nGM sold 5.1% more vehicles than it did a year ago, reaching 2.7 million, as its market share rose 0.5% to 17.3%.\n\nToyota came in second for the second year in a row, selling 2.5 million vehicles. The 8.4% year-over-year increase was accompanied by a 1% rise in market share to 15.5%.\n\nCar buyers may have been nervous about prices after President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement, but carmakers have eased those concerns by offering incentives.",

    "fullText": "Update: Police said the suspect in the Brown University shooting was found dead in Salem, New Hampshire, Thursday night. Follow the latest updates here. Our earlier story is below.\n\nLaw enforcement are investigating possible connections between the mass shooting at Brown University and the targeted killing of an MIT professor two days later, sources told CBS News.\n\nInvestigators are searching for a suspect in the mass shooting and a car that the person is believed to have rented, multiple law enforcement sources said. Authorities believe the rented vehicle is the same make and model of a car that was also detected in the vicinity of the MIT professor's apartment.\n\nMeanwhile, two law enforcement sources also told CBS News that an arrest warrant has been issued for a suspect in the Brown shooting.\n\nNuno Loureiro, who taught plasma physics at MIT and led its Plasma Science and Fusion Center, was shot Monday at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts. He died at a nearby hospital the next day. Police are investigating his death as a homicide.\n\nTwo days earlier, two students were killed and nine more were wounded when a gunman opened fire Saturday afternoon inside a classroom on Brown University's campus in Providence, Rhode Island, authorities said. The shooting occurred in the school's Barus & Holley engineering building during final exams.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the shooting, police said a male suspect had managed to escape from the building. In the hours and days that followed, police and the FBI released images and videos of the man they described as a person of interest walking around a nearby neighborhood several hours before the first 911 calls reporting the shooting came in.\n\nThe person in the images wore black clothing and a face mask. None of the footage pictured him clearly.\n\nA video released on Tuesday, though blurry, was the clearest picture of the person of interest released so far. The image appeared to be digitally enhanced.\n\nJohn Mulvaney, an FBI veteran of 26 years and the managing director of CBIZ Forensix Consulting Group, told CBS News Boston the footage appeared to show the person of interest \"casing the neighborhood.\"\n\nThe FBI is offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to the identification, arrest and conviction of the person responsible for the shooting.\n\nThe two students killed in the shooting were identified as Ella Cook, a sophomore from Alabama, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, an Uzbek American freshman student.\n\n\"Both were brilliant and beloved — as members of our campus community, but even more by their friends and families,\" Brown's president, Christina H. Paxson, wrote in a letter Tuesday to the university community. \"Our hearts continue to be with them in their profound sorrow.\"\n\nPerson of interest identified in deadly Brown University shooting\n\nWhat to expect from Trump's address to the nation\n\nNew surveillance video shows Nick Reiner before his arrest",

    "description": "Richard...",
    "fullText": "In 1994, the writer Leslie Marmon Silko wrote a piece for The Nation warning of a frightening new immigration regime.\n\nIn recent months, as the Trump administration has grown frustrated by the pace of deportations organized by ICE, it has sicced the even nastier Border Patrol on American cities—first Los Angeles, then Chicago, and now Charlotte. The move is the vicious culmination of a decades-long trend of hyper-militarized immigration enforcement.\n\nIn 1994, The Nation published “The Border Patrol State,” an essay by the Laguna Pueblo writer Leslie Marmon Silko about the increased presence of the Border Patrol far from the actual border. Silko grew up on a reservation and knew how the US government had mistreated Native peoples. Even so, this didn’t change the “wonderful sense of absolute freedom” she felt as she “cruised down the open road and across the vast desert plateaus.”\n\n“That wide open highway told us we were U.S. citizens,” she wrote, “we were free….”\n\nThat sense of freedom was destroyed, however, by an incident when she was driving with a companion from Albuquerque to Tucson. They came across a roadblock set up by the Border Patrol. The officers told them to step out of the car. “I will never forget that night beside the highway,” Silko wrote. “There was an awful feeling of menace and violence straining to break loose. It was clear that the uniformed men would be only too happy to drag us out of the car if we did not speedily comply with their request (asking a question is tantamount to resistance, it seems).”\n\n“The weird anger of these Border Patrolmen,” Silko continued, made her think of a report she had read about the thousands of people who had been disappeared during Argentina’s 1970s dirty war.\n\nIt was also clear that travelers were being racially targeted. The Border Patrol “exercises a power that no highway patrol or city patrolman possesses,” Silko wrote. “Other law-enforcement officers need a shred of probable cause in order to detain someone. On the books, so does the Border Patrol; but on the road, it’s another matter.”\n\n“This is the police state that has developed in the southwestern United States since the 1980s,” she added. Now, 31 years later, that police state has gone national.\n\nEven at the time, though, Silko understood where it was headed: “Manifest Destiny may lack its old grandeur of theft and blood—‘lock the door’ is what it means now.”\n\nHow darkly ironic it was, she reflected, that just a few years after the Iron Curtain came down in Europe, the US government had begun building a steel wall on the border with Mexico. “It is no use; borders haven’t worked, and they won’t work,” Silko concluded. “The great human migration within the Americas cannot be stopped; human beings are natural forces of the Earth, just as rivers and winds are natural forces.”\n\nOver the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T. Klare, Katha Pollitt, Amy Littlefield, Gregg Gonsalves, and Sasha Abramsky take on the Trump family’s corruption, set the record straight about Robert F.

    "description": "Teenagers, Alexandr Wang argues, have a built-in edge.",
    "fullText": "Eva is a fellow on Fortune's news desk.\n\nAlexandr Wang—who became the world’s youngest self-made billionaire at 24—is now, at 28, running one of the most ambitious AI efforts in Silicon Valley. In his first 60 days at Meta, he built a 100-person lab he described to TBPN hosts John Coogan and Jordi Hays as “smaller and more talent dense than any of the other labs.”\n\nHis goal: nothing less than superintelligence.\n\nWang, with his aerial view of the industry, has advice for kids, especially those in Gen Alpha now entering middle school: Forget gaming, sports, or traditional after-school hobbies.\n\n“If you are like 13 years old, you should spend all of your time vibe coding,” he said in his recent TBPN interview. “That’s how you should live your life.”\n\nFor Wang, the reasoning is simple. Every engineer, himself included, is now writing code he believes will be obsolete within five years.\n\n“Literally all the code I’ve written in my life will be replaced by what will be produced by an AI model,” he said.\n\nThat realization has left him, in his words, “radicalized by AI coding.” What matters most now isn’t syntax, or learning a particular language, but time spent experimenting with and steering AI tools.\n\n“It’s actually an incredible moment of discontinuity,” Wang said. “If you just happen to spend 10,000 hours playing with the tools and figuring out how to use them better than other people, that’s a huge advantage.”\n\nTeenagers have a clear advantage over adults: time and freedom to immerse themselves in new technology. And while in the past, entrepreneurial teenagers leveraged this time to be “sneaker flippers” or run Minecraft servers, Wang says the focus should now be on the code.\n\nHe compares the moment to the dawn of the PC revolution. The Bill Gateses and Mark Zuckerbergs of the world had an “immense advantage” simply because they grew up tinkering with the earliest machines.\n\n“That moment is happening right now,” Wang said. “And the people who spend the most time with it will have the edge in the future economy.”\n\nWang isn’t coy about Meta’s ambitions. He calls the company’s infrastructure, scale, and product distribution unmatched.\n\n“We have the business model to support building literally hundreds of billions of dollars of compute,” he said.\n\nHis team, just over 100 people, is deliberately designed to be “smaller and more talent dense” than rivals. “The other labs are like 10 times bigger,” Wang said, but their lab had “cracked” coders.\n\nThe lab is split into three pillars: research, product, and infrastructure. Research builds the models Wang says will “ultimately be superintelligent.” Product ensures they get distributed across billions of users through Meta’s platforms. And infrastructure focuses on what he calls “literally the largest data centers in the world.”\n\nWang is particularly excited about hardware. Like many Meta executives now, he points to the company’s new smart glasses, which had a hilariously foppish demo, as the “natural delivery mechanism for superintelligence.”\n\nPlaced right next to the human senses, they will merge digital perception with cognition.\n\n“It will literally feel like cognitive enhancement,” Wang said. “You will gain 100 IQ points by having your superintelligence right next to you.”\n\nVibe coding is the shorthand for this shift: using natural language prompts to generate and iterate on code. Rather than writing complex syntax, users describe their intent, and AI produces functioning prototypes.\n\nThe concept is spreading across Silicon Valley’s C-suites. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski has said he can now test ideas in 20 minutes, instead of burning weeks of engineering cycles. Google CEO Sundar Pichai revealed that AI already generates more than 30% of new code at the company, calling it the biggest leap in software creation in 25 years.\n\nWang takes that further. For him, vibe coding isn’t just a productivity hack, but a future cultural mandate. What matters isn’t the code itself — it’s the hours of intuition-building that come from pushing AI tools to their limits, which is why he urges Gen Alpha to start early.\n\n“The role of an engineer is just very different now than it was before,” he said.\n\nA version of this story was published on Fortune.com on September 19, 2025.",

    "description": "\"I'm not sure anybody's going to trust an encyclopedia that has a thumb on the scales,\" Wikipedia cofounder Jimmy Wales told The Verge.",
    "fullText": "The cofounder of Wikipedia isn't so sure people trust Elon Musk's AI-powered rival, Grokipedia.\n\nMusk launched Grokipedia in October after years of accusing Wikipedia of left-wing bias. In an interview with The Verge, Wikipedia cofounder Jimmy Wales said that he had only looked at Grokipedia \"a little.\"\n\nAsked for his thoughts, Wales referenced some of the backlash to Musk's AI-based encyclopedia.\n\n\"I think a lot of the criticism that it's getting is not surprising to me,\" Wales said.\n\n\"I also think in terms of the question of trust, I'm not sure anybody's going to trust an encyclopedia that has a thumb on the scales,\" he added.\n\nWales looked to draw a distinction between himself and Musk. When Wales doesn't like something on Wikipedia, he opens a conversation, he said. That compares to Musk, who Wales suggested would likely change things he disagreed with himself.\n\nMusk has a history of getting involved in the details of his companies and making top-down leadership calls. During his Twitter takeover, Musk ordered that the social platform's algorithm prioritize serving his own posts to users more frequently, X employees told \"Extremely Hardcore\" author Zoe Schiffer, who reported on the development for Platformer.\n\nWales also pointed to the use of Grok, xAI's large language model, for writing and editing entries.\n\n\"I use large language models a lot and I know about the hallucination problem, and I see it all the time,\" he said. \"Large language models really aren't good enough to write an encyclopedia.\"\n\nWikipedia, which undoubtedly is looking to prevent its users from switching to a rival like Grokipedia, allows itself to be scraped by AI bots. Some Grokipedia pages are almost identical to the Wikipedia entries, users have found.\n\nWales referenced reports that Grokipedia's entries \"agree with Elon Musk's political views.\" Business Insider identified key political differences between the two encyclopedias, particularly on topics such as the January 6 Capitol Riots and the 2014 Gamergate controversy.\n\n\"It's Elon, but that might not be what we all want from an encyclopedia,\" Wales said.\n\nAccusations of left-wing bias have long been leveled against Wikipedia — including by Wales' cofounder. Larry Sanger left the online encyclopedia in 2002. Since then, he's called it \"badly biased\" and captured by \"liberals and leftists.\" (Wales previously told podcaster Lex Fridman that Sanger \"doesn't get enough credit\" for Wikipedia, but suggested \"cofounder's not the right title\" for his contributions.)\n\nMusk has big ambitions for Grokipedia. In November, Musk called the encyclopedia the \"modern-day Library of Alexandria,\" and said that he wanted to eventually send it to deep space.\n\nThe site seems to be growing. Since November, Grokipedia shifted from \"v0.1\" to \"v0.2.\" Its total article count grew to 1,089,057, up from the 885,279 it had when it launched.\n\nWikipedia, in comparison, has over 7 million articles.",

    "fullText": "Over 50 million retired workers across the country are cashing in Social Security checks — but, depending on where they're spending their golden years, some might deposit higher monthly payments than their fellow retirees.\n\nRecipients in states across the East Coast, for instance, receive higher median monthly payments than their peers in some Southern states — although they may end up paying some of that back in taxes. Even so, recipients in New Jersey and Connecticut are the most likely to be cashing in heftier checks, according to 2024 data collected in the Social Security Administration's 2025 Annual Statistical Supplement.\n\nRetirees in New Jersey receive a median $2,172 monthly, the highest across states; compare that to $1,726 in Louisiana and Mississippi, the states where recipients see the lowest median payments. As of November 2025, retired workers nationally were receiving an average monthly benefit of around $1,960, according to the Social Security Administration. They're also slated to see their benefits increase further in the new year, as a 2.8% cost-of-living increase kicks in. For retirees in states like Connecticut and New Jersey, that might be a larger boon.\n\nOf course, monthly payments don't paint the whole picture of retirees' finances. Many rely on Social Security as their main source of income, or simultaneously find themselves working well into retirement to stay afloat. And the cost of essentials — which are still being weighed down by inflation — can make a big dent in how far monthly checks stretch.\n\nThe AARP conducted its own analysis of the University of Massachusetts Boston's Elder Index, which tracks how much older adults need to comfortably survive while accounting for things like food, housing, healthcare, and location. Per that analysis, Social Security benefits fall short of covering older Americans' basic expenses in every state, but they stretch the furthest in states like Indiana, West Virginia, and Alabama. While New Jerseyians receive an average of $2,190 monthly, AARP found the monthly basic expenses for a retired worker who owns their home and still has a mortgage come in at $4,149.\n\nDo you rely on Social Security, or are you struggling to get by while receiving checks?

    "description": "C-section rates at individual hospitals are hard to find. Search our map by hospital name, city, state, or ZIP code to compare facilities near you.",
    "fullText": "At Valley Baptist Medical Center in Brownsville, Texas, doctors performed C-sections on half of all women with low-risk pregnancies — first-time mothers at full term, carrying a single baby positioned head-down — on average, in a seven-year period.\n\nThat's double the low-risk C-section rate of the next closest hospital, less than 5 miles away.\n\nThe contrast isn't unique to the Rio Grande Valley. Across the country, neighboring hospitals deliver babies at vastly different C-section rates — even when controlling for factors like maternal age, health complications, and whether a hospital treats high-risk pregnancies.\n\nBusiness Insider spent months compiling C-section data from 29 states and Washington, DC, analyzing rates at 1,744 hospitals that collectively deliver around 70% of babies born in the US each year. The result: the first comprehensive, publicly searchable map of hospital C-section rates across the country.\n\nSearch by hospital name, city, state, or ZIP code to see C-section rates at hospitals near you. Click on any hospital to compare its rates with nearby facilities.\n\nHospitals change ownership — and names — frequently. Business Insider used the hospital name provided by each state department of health. Hospital names in our database may have since changed.\n\nThe table shows whether each hospital performs overall C-sections at higher, lower, or similar rates compared to the next closest hospital. Color coding indicates whether a hospital's rate falls above or below the national average for overall, first-time, or low-risk C-section rates in Business Insider's dataset.\n\nFor states that didn't provide low-risk C-section data, the map displays first-time rates. If neither metric was available, it shows overall rates.\n\nThe map displays three types of C-section rates for over 1,700 hospitals:\n\nOverall rates include all C-sections, whether a woman is undergoing her first surgery or has had the procedure before.\n\nFirst-time rates track C-sections performed on women giving birth for the first time — a critical metric since a first C-section almost always leads to more surgeries in later pregnancies.\n\nLow-risk rates measure C-sections performed on women with these lowest-risk pregnancies. Maternal health experts consider this the most authoritative metric for comparing hospitals, since these women are the least likely to need surgery to safely deliver.\n\nThe map reveals dramatic variation. Hospital C-section rates swing from as low as 4% overall at a hospital in Alaska to as high as 62% overall at a hospital in Florida.\n\nBusiness Insider identified 158 hospitals with average low-risk C-section rates at least 25% higher than their nearest neighbor.\n\nMultiple studies show that one of the biggest risk factors for undergoing a medically unnecessary C-section is the hospital where a woman delivers — even when accounting for maternal age, race, health, income, and whether a hospital specializes in high-risk births.\n\nDozens of obstetricians, midwives, and labor nurses told Business Insider that while C-sections are often lifesaving, concerns for maternal health aren't the only influences driving surgery rates. They cited fear of lawsuits, understaffing, and indirect financial incentives; C-sections are more profitable and cost-effective than vaginal deliveries.\n\nThe consequences are serious. Each additional C-section a woman undergoes increases her risk of severe complications like placenta accreta, a life-threatening condition that almost always requires a hysterectomy to prevent hemorrhage.\n\nNot all states have data. Many hospitals don't publicly disclose their C-section rates. Eleven states would not produce data identifying individual hospitals, citing confidentiality policies or saying they don't track the information. Twenty-eight states required formal public records requests, sometimes charging fees reaching $1,500.\n\nRead more about how Business Insider collected hospitals' C-section data here.",

    "description": "Rebecca Reed, 87, is still working out of necessity. She earns $12 an hour as a church secretary and an editorial assistant in New Orleans.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rebecca Reed, 87, who earns $12 an hour working as a church secretary and an editorial assistant in New Orleans. Reed said she works out of financial necessity and would like to be retired. Business Insider has verified Reed's current income and employment with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I was younger, I worked largely in retail. I spent four years in Europe because my first husband was in the military, then came back and worked in a dress shop.\n\nAfter getting a divorce, I ended up becoming a credit manager. That was very unusual at the time because women were often secretaries, not credit managers. I met my second husband at that company.\n\nAfter the company went under, I stopped working.\n\nWhen we had both been working, we were earning good salaries, and I never questioned anything about our finances. I really should have.\n\nWe had separate checking accounts at the time and took a lot of trips. Little did I know that neither of us had much in our savings.\n\nWe were both on Social Security, but when he died, I realized there was no insurance. It was complicated, but he had children and an ex-wife, and all this stuff got mixed up.\n\nI had to file for bankruptcy soon after, because I couldn't pay the bills. My car was falling apart, and I had to do everything on my own. There was still a mortgage on the house, which I did not know about, and the note at the time was about $1,000 a month. If it hadn't been for my family, I don't know where I would be. I wouldn't have the house for sure, because I couldn't have afforded it.\n\nI also had two serious car accidents within the past two years, and now I have a car note that's choking me to death. I also fractured my shoulder in one of the accidents, and had to get physical therapy. Otherwise, my health is very good. I should probably exercise more and eat better, though.\n\nI asked myself, What am I going to do? I'm old.\n\nThe secretary at the church I go to quit, so I was able to get the job. I work Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. I get paid $12 an hour, although sometimes, my church was the site of filmings, during which I made $20 an hour, but that's since dried up. The job also doesn't provide insurance, though I have Medicare.\n\nI realized I needed a little more money, so last December, I got another part-time job working at a candy store in the French Quarter. However, that was hard because I had to park far away and walk there, so I couldn't keep that job. Instead, I began working for a woman who was writing the history of her husband as an editorial assistant. At that job, I'm also paid $12 an hour.\n\nI only get Social Security, which is around $3,000 a month. I finally paid off the house, which was a miracle.\n\nI wish I had started saving earlier. If you don't save now, it's going to turn around and kick you in the butt.\n\nI also wish I had my insurance figured out.\n\nI don't have any insurance on my house. If a hurricane comes along and blows it away, I'm going to have to sell the lot. It is outrageously expensive; people are paying over $6,000 a year just for homeowners' insurance.\n\nI have to pay my car note, food costs, and upkeep on the house. There was a termite infestation on the roof, so I put in a new roof. I get good mileage on the car and only fill up around once every week and a half.\n\nI'm the only one still working in my family. My sisters and all of my friends are retired. Whenever we set up a high school reunion, they have to plan it around when I can go.\n\nSometimes, I think it might be OK to quit these two jobs and just stay home. I could tighten up a little more and get rid of things like Netflix.\n\nIf it were up to me, I would rather be home eating bonbons and watching TV. But I can't. In order to do the things I want to do, I need more income.\n\nI recently took a trip with my sister to Gulf Shores in Alabama, and it was a wonderful getaway. I wouldn't be able to do that if I weren't working.\n\nI'm 87 years old now, and I keep thinking, \"What is my future?\" I don't know how much longer I have. I'd love a future of not working and having a little more money, where I can go out to eat with friends occasionally and buy things I really like. But I really can't, unless I win the lottery, and I don't play the lottery, so I don't have a chance.\n\nI told the president of the church council that when I hit 90, I'm out of here, so I have some time for myself. Still, maybe I won't be able to retire. Who knows?",

    "title": "Nvidia memo says Capital One discussed alternatives to AWS as AI costs could 'get out of hand'",
    "description": "Several AWS customers have complained about rising cloud costs in the AI era. Capital One is the latest, and one of the biggest.",
    "fullText": "Capital One is concerned about AI costs rising via its cloud-computing relationship with Amazon and may be looking for alternatives, according to an internal Nvidia document obtained by Business Insider.\n\nIn the document, an Nvidia employee wrote that the chip giant talked with Capital One about AI infrastructure alternatives to Amazon Web Services, as the bank was \"looking to control costs.\"\n\nThe Nvidia staffer was recapping discussions with Capital One in an internal email after meeting representatives from the bank at a recent tech conference.\n\n\"They see their need for GPUs and reasoning models growing and the costs in AWS will soon get out of hand,\" the Nvidia employee wrote, referring to Capital One.\n\nNvidia and Capital One discussed \"AI factory and neo-clouds,\" according to the email. An AI factory is an in-house data center that a company can build to train and run AI models as an alternative to renting compute from a third party. Financial institutions can use this infrastructure for tasks such as fraud detection, customer support, and algorithmic trading, according to Nvidia.\n\nNeoclouds are upstart cloud providers, often powered by Nvidia hardware, that focus on AI workloads, whereas AWS supports a much broader range of computing needs. Top neocloud players include CoreWeave, Lambda, Crusoe, and Nebius. Nvidia has been working closely with several of these players, in part to reduce its reliance on established cloud giants as customers.\n\nThe Capital One situation underscores a key dynamic in the AI boom. Companies are racing to adopt generative AI but also trying to mitigate rising cloud costs. This new technology has great promise, but developing and running AI models and AI applications can be expensive.\n\nLarge companies also regularly assess their cloud spending, including varying setups that increasingly incorporate multiple providers. Forty-three percent of companies use more than two public cloud providers, according to a recent RBC Capital report.\n\n\"We continue to be committed to AWS as our predominant strategic cloud partner,\" a Capital One spokesperson wrote in a statement. Nvidia declined to comment.\n\n\"Our pricing philosophy is to work relentlessly to take cost out of our own cost structure and to pass those savings back to our AWS customers in the form of lower prices,\" an AWS spokesperson said. \"It's easy to lower prices, it's much harder to be able to afford to lower prices, and at AWS we work really hard at that.\"\n\nCapital One isn't the only company taking issue with AWS costs. Business Insider's Eugene Kim reported in October that AI startups are increasingly delaying traditional AWS spend in favor of AI model and developer tools, according to internal Amazon documents from March and July.\n\nThe documents said that 90% of startups in Radical Ventures' portfolio were building primarily on rival clouds due to AWS costs. Amazon also noted internally that there was increasing demand from customers for neocloud providers, which let them rent GPU power in small chunks and only pay for what they use.\n\nWhen that story published in October, an AWS spokesperson said Business Insider was \"using old data to reach outdated conclusions,\" noting that \"AWS remains the top choice for startups to build because we offer the best core services as well as the most innovative and powerful generative AI offerings.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "Steve Bannon discussed using an obscure legal tactic to join Jeffrey Epstein's legal team",
    "description": "The arrangement could explain why Steve Bannon's 15 hours of Jeffrey Epstein footage haven't seen the light of day.",
    "fullText": "It has been over six years since Steve Bannon filmed what he said were 15 hours of interviews with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nFewer than 30 seconds have seen the light of day.\n\nThough he possesses exclusive footage of the final weeks of the life of the well-connected pedophile — who remains one of the most potent political topics on the planet — Bannon has kept his footage under wraps.\n\nA cache of emails and text messages made public by the House Oversight Committee may help explain why: Epstein and Bannon discussed using an obscure legal maneuver that would technically make Bannon part of Epstein's legal defense team.\n\nIn the communications, which the House Oversight Committee obtained by subpoenaing Epstein's estate, Bannon and Epstein discuss forging a Kovel agreement — a type of legal arrangement that extends attorney-client privilege to non-lawyers. That agreement could protect the footage from public release under the shield of attorney-client confidentiality.\n\n\"We need to talk about kovel. Letter and black bag.\" Epstein texted Bannon while discussing filming. \"As in a kovel agreement re accounting and finance. Legal privleged.\"\n\nAttorneys typically use Kovel agreements when they need the expertise of non-lawyers to assist them with legal work.\n\nAn attorney working on a financial fraud case might use a Kovel letter to retain a forensic accountant to help unpack complex financial records. That agreement, between the attorney and the accountant, would protect the accountant's work product under attorney-client privilege so the opposing side's lawyers can't obtain it in discovery.\n\n\"I don't want someone to say, 'You waive the privilege by disclosing that to a third party,'\" explained Bruce Green, a legal ethics professor at Fordham Law School. \"So I make the accountant part of my team the way my paralegal is part of the team.\"\n\nKovel agreements can also be used for public relations professionals. In a text message conversation, Epstein suggested just such an arrangement between Bannon and his longtime personal attorney, Darren Indyke.\n\nEpstein said Indyke would pay for the videos and have \"final control\" over the work product, while Bannon would make money on whatever they ultimately produced.\n\n\"here is what I think will work legally,\" Epstein told Bannon in a series of text messages in April 2019, as the two began discussing the videos. \"I pay direct costs of filming. As Darren is the contractor for legal service prep . It gets paid by Darren. He has final control as it is his work product.\"\n\n\"I have no interest whatsoever in making money here,\" Epstein continued. \"Zero . You deserve whatever it brings . As it is our cost , no return on it.\"\n\nBannon responded with \"K\" and asked if they could film that weekend.\n\nBannon didn't respond to requests for comment for this story. He has not responded to Business Insider's requests for comment about his relationship with Epstein for about four years. At a political conference in July, Bannon told a fan that he would release the \"documentary\" as a five-part series \"early next year.\"\n\nBannon hasn't released any footage since The New York Post posted a trailer in 2021, nor has he discussed the project on his daily political podcast, \"War Room.\" A person close to Bannon said they haven't seen any indication that the footage is being edited.\n\nMark Epstein said Bannon told him in a meeting months after his brother Jeffrey's death that he couldn't see the footage because it was \"witness preparation\" and protected under attorney-client confidentiality.\n\n\"He said he had 16 hours of tapes,\" Mark Epstein told Business Insider. \"He said they were in his vault and they were protected under attorney-client privilege. I don't how, because he's not an attorney. But anyhow, that's what he told me.\"\n\nThe emails and text messages made public by the House Oversight Committee show Bannon and Epstein communicating as early as February 2018, several months after Bannon stopped working as President Donald Trump's White House advisor in his first term. The two continued their relationship at least up until Epstein's arrest on sex-trafficking charges in July 2019.\n\nIn that time period, Epstein was dealing with a swarm of civil litigation from women who had accused him of sexual abuse, as well as a new criminal investigation from Manhattan federal prosecutors following a November 2018 Miami Herald investigation about his conduct.\n\nBannon — who had led Breitbart News and written and directed nine documentaries — described the media coverage as a \"sophisticated op\" against Epstein.\n\nThe 2019 text messages show Bannon and Epstein discussing a project that would burnish Epstein's reputation by introducing the public to other facets of his life, like his views on politics, finance, and science.\n\nEpstein and Bannon talked about which of the financier's impressive acquaintances could appear in the program, including academic Noam Chomsky and Nobel Prize-winning molecular biologist James Watson.\n\nEpstein said in his usual typo-strewn writing style that Bannon's goal would be \"to himanize the monster.\"\n\nBannon suggested focusing on a narrative of redemption.\n\n\"we must counter 'rapist who traffics in female children to be raped by worlds most powerful , richest men'--- that can't be redeemed,\" Bannon told Epstein.\n\n\"Can't redeem unredeemable -- you are a lot of things-which we will show-- but you are NOT that,\" Bannon said in another text.\n\nIt's not clear whether Indyke and Bannon ultimately signed a Kovel letter before Epstein's arrest and death. Epstein talked about Bannon needing to sign a \"letter\" for Indyke for \"the engagement for litigation services\" as late as June 2019. Around the same time, Bannon urged Epstein to finalize the terms so that he could assemble a film crew.\n\n\"Can we make this deal today so I can pull my crew off other stuff they are working on and get this thing done -- we are burning daylight,\" Bannon texted Epstein.\n\n\"YEs. Do you have a lawyer . ? we need to document past and future, all needs surgical care,\" Epstein replied.\n\nFor a Kovel agreement to be done properly, Indyke would have needed to hire Bannon to assist on the lawyer's work for Epstein, according to Green. Work between a client and a public relations professional can't be shielded by a Kovel agreement just because a lawyer is involved, Green said.\n\n\"Half the time or more, when the client hires a PR person and uses the lawyer to try to create a Kovel theory, it doesn't work,\" Green said. \"Because the court looks at it and says, 'This isn't really designed to assist the lawyer — it's designed to assist the client.'\"\n\nAs the co-execitor of Epstein's estate, Indyke has the power to waive attorney-client confidentiality on the dead financier's behalf.\n\nDaniel Weiner, an attorney representing Indyke and Richard Kahn, the other estate co-executor, declined to comment on whether the Kovel agreement existed.\n\nIn May of 2019, while discussing communications between \"darren\" and a member of Bannon's team, Epstein indicated they had worked out at least some kind of agreement.\n\n\"You and i are perfect. All under privlege,\" Epstein wrote.",

    "description": "Andrea Wasserman has conducted hundreds of annual performance reviews. She's noticed that the strongest employees prepare in a few specific ways.",
    "fullText": "Throughout my career leading teams at Nordstrom, Verizon, and Yahoo, I've conducted hundreds of annual performance reviews. Some employees walked in composed, prepared, and ready to shape their career trajectory. Others arrived defensive, unfocused, or unclear about what the conversation was actually meant to accomplish.\n\nThis year, in a market of layoffs and other financial pressures, those differences matter more than ever.\n\nCompanies are operating with leaner teams, tighter budgets, and sharper expectations. Managers are being asked to do more with less, and employees are being evaluated not only on what they accomplish, but also on how well they adapt, collaborate, and contribute to shifting priorities.\n\nDon't treat your performance conversation like a formality. It's likely one of the few moments each year when you have structured, committed time with your manager to clarify expectations, reinforce your value, and influence the direction of your role.\n\nHere are seven ways that the strongest employees prepare — and how you can, too.\n\nMost employees view performance reviews as an opportunity for information exchange, but they're also an energy exchange. How you show up — your tone, body language, and openness — significantly affects how the conversation unfolds.\n\nTry to avoid rushing into this appointment from another meeting or fresh off your commute. Carve out a calendar window to collect your thoughts one last time so you walk in (or click \"join,\" if remote) in a state of calm and confidence. You want your voice to sound steady and measured so that you don't appear harried, and you should be ready to sit down with your materials organized instead of fidgeting.\n\nI've seen high performers walk in so nervous or braced for criticism that they unknowingly projected defensiveness. The best ways you can show up are grounded, collaborative, and ready for a productive discussion.\n\nEmployees often make the mistake of treating the performance review as a highlights reel. They emphasize the wins, gloss over the challenges, and hope the harder parts of the year won't come up.\n\nManagers see right through it because they worked with you all year. Now isn't the time to try to hide what you wish hadn't happened or to hope your manager forgot about it. It's better to show accountability, own the narrative, and explain how you'll improve.\n\nI once had a consistently strong performer who always submitted a self-assessment that felt more like a promotional email than a reflection. It unintentionally made him seem less self-aware — and less ready for the next level.\n\nManagers pay close attention to whether you can accurately and objectively evaluate your own performance. It's one of the clearest indicators of long-term potential.\n\nFew managers are tracking every detail of your work — especially in organizations where leaders oversee multiple teams or large portfolios of projects. If you don't bring evidence of your impact, there's a good chance no one will remember it when it counts.\n\nYour goal isn't to overwhelm your manager with metrics and spreadsheets. It's to make your accomplishments easy to see and to provide context for why they matter.\n\nA few specific data points can make a big impact:\n\nEmployees often forget that this conversation isn't just about their performance; it's also about the conditions that shape their performance. Good managers will ask you what they can do for you. If you have nothing to say in response, you're wasting an opportunity to make a targeted, strategic ask.\n\nThis is your moment to articulate where you need support to become more effective, such as clearer priorities, cross-functional backing, earlier feedback, exposure to decision-makers, or help navigating organizational friction.\n\nManagers appreciate employees who can name what's getting in the way of doing great work and express it in a way that's actionable rather than whiny. It signals maturity and strategic thinking, not weakness.\n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions employees have is assuming their manager remembers their long-term aspirations. Even well-intentioned leaders don't always hold those details at the forefront of their minds.\n\nYour performance conversation is the moment to reinforce them and an opportunity to check in on where you stand relative to them.\n\nShare the skills you want to build, the responsibilities you want to grow into, and the direction you want your role to evolve. Then, connect your goals to the business's needs.\n\nAt one company, a manager on my team consistently communicated her interest in leading larger cross-functional programs. Because she was clear, consistent, and aligned with the company's direction, she was top of mind when that opportunity arose.\n\nThis is part of the brief mindset work you'll want to do right before the meeting: Be prepared to maintain your composure, especially if you hear something you don't like.\n\nOne of the quickest ways I've seen employees stall their career momentum is by reacting defensively to feedback. Even when the feedback is minor, a strong emotional reaction signals to the manager that the employee may not be ready for more complex responsibilities.\n\nManagers don't expect you to agree with every point, but they do expect you to listen, ask clarifying questions, and stay open to understanding the perspective behind the feedback. If you're particularly upset by something or you're asked for a response and you can't think of an appropriate one quickly, say that you'd like to think about it and will follow up later in the day with your thoughts.\n\nBeing coachable — especially in challenging moments — is one of the clearest indicators that you're ready for more responsibility and increased visibility within the organization. The most significant way to prove that you're coachable is to build an action plan that addresses the feedback you received and then report back on how you've improved.\n\nAn annual meeting shouldn't be the end of the conversation. It should be the starting point on a road map that you own and that your manager supports.\n\nThe strongest employees schedule a follow-up 30 to 60 days later to discuss their progress on the feedback and the goals that were set. In those conversations, they show what they've already implemented and what they're still working on. Again, try to separate this important dialogue from one that gets bogged down in the details of your day-to-day tasks.\n\nMeaningful follow-through sends a powerful signal that you take your development and contributions seriously, and that you're accountable for your growth. Long after the data you've shared becomes a foggy memory, your consistency will remain top-of-mind, especially when it's time for promotion or compensation discussions.",

    "fullText": "Slop bowls. AI layoffs. What your girlfriend spends money on.\n\nAll of those themes have a place in investors' portfolios for 2026, according to Citrini Research, which unveiled its top bets for the market heading into the new year.\n\nCitrini, which releases an annual \"thematic watchlist\" for investors, ended up handily beating the market with many of its 2025 calls. An equal-weighted portfolio of the firm's individual stock picks for the year gained 26.5%, outpacing the S&P 500's 15% gain. Around half of the 25 investment baskets it created for the year also beat the benchmark.\n\nThe firm's investment ideas for the coming year were based on trends it believes are unfolding.\n\n\"Some we think could be real winners, some are preparation for a specific scenario or eventuality, some we simply want to keep on our screen,\" Citrini wrote on Wednesday.\n\nHere are some of the firm's most interesting market calls going into 2026.\n\nThesis: Critrini said it was bullish on stocks that were best-positioned to benefit from AI by reducing headcount.\n\nThe firm said it screened for companies that could most benefit from AI-induced layoffs by developing a \"Bureaucracy Score\", a gauge that measures how robust a firm's administrative and managerial layers are, as well as a \"Margin Optionality Score,\" which determines if a company is able to earn more if its workforce were leaner.\n\nCitrini identified over thirty firms in this category. Here are some of the largest on the list:\n\nThesis: Critrini said it believes slop bowl chains would be among the first to benefit from back-of-house automation, which would allow those firms to reduce labor costs and boost profit margins.\n\nChipotle, Cava, and other restaurants within the slop bowl universe are likely headed for an inflection point next year, they said.\n\nThe firm identified several slop bowl food chains and robotics companies that could benefit from the shift:\n\nThesis: As drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy become more popular, an investment opportunity is growing among users who are looking to keep the weight off after they stop taking a GLP-1 drug, Citrini said.\n\nThe firm pointed to GaINAc-SiRNA drugs, which are believed to help users preserve lean body mass and \"deliver sustained metabolic benefit.\" The drugs are also believed to redistribute fat away from \"metabolically harmful sites,\" Citrini added, referring to visceral fat, which resides deep in the abdominal cavity.\n\nThesis: The firm pointed to the Girlfriend Index, an online indicator built around the idea that investors can identify market opportunities based on what female consumers are spending money on.\n\nQuiet luxury fading out of the cultural zeitgeist is one such trend that looks to be gaining traction in 2026, Citrini said, citing contributions from The Girlfriend Index, a Substack that publishes a weekly memo on female-driven consumer spending.\n\n\"When culture rotates from restraint to expression, heritage luxury historically leads. The emerging expression of 2026 is luxury as self-expression,\" Citrini wrote.",

    "description": "What's it like to dress up like Max Headroom or execute a \"Dirty Dancing\" lift at work? Blackstone executives take us behind the scenes.",
    "fullText": "Imagine showing up to work at your high-powered Wall Street job and being asked to play Max Headroom, or execute the iconic lift from \"Dirty Dancing?\"\n\nBlackstone's latest holiday video dropped on Thursday, celebrating the firm's 40th anniversary with a slew of 80s references. Three of the Blackstone executives featured in the latest edition of the \"cringeworthy\" Wall Street tradition spoke to Business Insider about their experience.\n\nAs Business Insider has previously reported, the process takes months, usually starting in the summer with a brainstorm between Blackstone President Jon Gray, head of external affairs Christine Anderson, and head of video Jay Gillespie.\n\nThis year's video includes roughly 400 employees, up from just 20 in 2018. Roles range from Gray's permanent casting as impish instigator to the casting of all of the firm's global partners for a parody of \"We Are the World.\"\n\nThe three holiday video actors spoke to us about what it was like to be selected and what filming was like. They also told us that their commitment to embarrassing themselves and having some fun is resonating everywhere, from their clients' boardrooms to their personal lives.\n\nZaneta Koplewicz, BREIT director, co-president, and head of shareholder relations, had been a dancer while at Princeton and considered herself \"a pretty serious ballet dancer\", a fact she revealed earlier this year while being interviewed for one of the firm's social media videos. Her dance experience led to her being cast to do the lift from Dirty Dancing at the climax of this year's musical number.\n\n\"After the shoot happened, I asked, 'Who would have done this if not me?'\" Koplewicz said. \"They were like no, Zaneta, this scene wouldn't have happened.\"\n\nWhen Koplewicz was first asked, she said she \"braced\" herself.\n\n\"I reminded them that I danced 20 years ago,\" Koplewicz said.\n\nDan Leiter, head of international for the firm's credit and insurance arm and global head of liquid credit, was asked to appear in the video in 2024, his first year with the firm since joining from Morgan Stanley. At the time, he said, he could \"tell it was a real privilege to be chosen to be part of this video.\"\n\nMike Forman, Blackstone real estate's head of digital infrastructure, first found out that he was going to be in this year's video via a calendar invite that \"popped up\" on his calendar. Among his first thoughts, he told Business Insider, was:\n\n\"I wonder how I'll be embarrassing myself this year?\"\n\nThe video team films most of the video at the end of November and the beginning of December, fitting shooting into busy schedules.\n\nIn his scene, Forman is tasked by Gray to fire Ken Burns, who had been hired to create a characteristically slow documentary series.\n\nForman said the filming operation was quick; he came to Gray's office, filmed the scene, and Gray was off again to do \"other important things.\"\n\n\"We were trying our best to be actors, which is definitely not our day job,\" Forman said.\n\nBecause shooting is condensed across a few weeks, scenes can be booked back-to-back. That can lead to an audience of employees dressed in \"outrageous\" outfits while one is shooting, said Leiter, who played Max Headroom, the \"computer-generated\" TV presenter from the 1980s\n\nHe recalled one scene that he and a colleague couldn't help laughing at, even though they weren't supposed to.\n\n\"They had to retake it twice because we laughed so hard,\" Leiter said. \"The third time, the person filming said that we had to leave the room.\"\n\nKoplewicz, held up by a professional dancer, nailed the move in front of an audience of her colleagues last week after researching it on YouTube. She said she had one practice round before the cameras started rolling.\n\nBlackstone declined to share the cost of the holiday video, but last year Business Insider reported that the firm's video team consisted of more than 20 full-time staffers and produced over 2,200 videos, ranging from social media content to the firm's increasingly visible advertisements.\n\nAfter Leiter's school-aged children saw him in 2024's video, they \"insisted\" on watching every Blackstone holiday video.\n\nThey eventually got \"addicted\" to singing the songs, he said.\n\nThis year's video is already coming up in client meetings.\n\n\"Last week, I was in the Middle East, and I had a couple of clients ask when the video was coming out so they could bookmark the date,\" said Leiter.\n\nKoplewicz's nonspeaking role last year as an \"investor\" on \"The Inve$tor,\" a Bachelor send-up, came up in an unexpected place: her son had just started elementary school that year, and one of her \"new mom friends\" posted the video to their group text shortly after it dropped, she said.",

    "fullText": "Each morning, you can brew your coffee, brush your teeth — and read your Google AI briefing.\n\nGoogle Labs announced a new AI productivity tool on Tuesday, titled CC. Built with Gemini, CC prepares a morning rundown of priorities based on the user's Gmail, Calendar, and Drive. Google users can also email CC at any time to perform tasks such as setting reminders, scheduling events, or summarizing emails.\n\nCC comes from Google Labs, the division of Google that started \"Project Tailwind\" in 2022. That later produced NotebookLM, Google's AI research tool that was a breakout hit.\n\nAfter a few hours on the waitlist, I was approved to receive my own CC briefing. At 5:18 a.m. the following morning, \"Your Day Ahead\" hit my inbox, with Google AI celebrating the coming weekend. Here's what it had:\n\nI get dozens of newsletters. I emailed back: \"Hey CC, can you pick out the four most important stories in all the unread newsletters in my inbox that I should read?\"\n\nMy CC said that it \"couldn't find many newsletters from today,\" only finding one from CNN that it said it was \"unable to pull a full summary\" of. That was odd: There were also two unread New York Times newsletters, one from New York magazine, and one from GQ.\n\nIt did pull four articles from yesterday's newsletters, though, offering me three Vanity Fair stories and one from The Atlantic.\n\nI decided to try a simpler task. Sometimes Letterboxd will send out free or discounted movie tickets, but the offers get stuck in my \"promotions\" folder. Were there any offers I should know about?\n\nMy CC responded with five different discounts for movies like \"No Other Choice\" and \"The Voice of Hind Rajab.\" I wouldn't know those offers existed if I hadn't asked!\n\nFor me, that's the real promise of Google's CC: To go through the endless promotional emails and decide what you should know. It's a deals magnet, without having to rummage through the spam folder.\n\nI'm sure CC would be a great enterprise workplace tool, but it's not yet allowed. The waitlist is open to Google users in the United States and Canada who are 18 years old or older who use a personal email. No enterprise accounts are permitted.\n\nIf you want to give Google's CC tool a try, you can join the wait list here.",

    "description": "Tesla was struggling hard as recently as March. But its stock has soared as the company's fortunes have turned around.",
    "fullText": "2025 has been a good year for comebacks.\n\nWe got the first \"Final Destination\" movie in 14 years. Future NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Philip Rivers unretired last week after nearly five years away. And of course you have Michael Burry ferociously blogging up a storm after an extended public absence.\n\nThe stock market has also seen its share of reclamation stories, with none more high-profile than Tesla, the eternal lightning rod.\n\nAfter a post-election Trump bump in late 2024, the company endured a difficult first quarter. Shares were nearly cut in half as CEO Elon Musk pivoted to government work by spearheading DOGE, and as sales fell globally. It was a grim time for shareholders.\n\nBut the company was able to turn things around, and currently sits just below record highs. The chart below, and the accompanying sections, trace the timeline of Tesla's stock resurgence.\n\nApril: Musk steps back from DOGE\n\nInvestors were getting restless that Musk was too focused on Washington, and not focused enough on making EVs. Then, when he said he'd step away from DOGE, they breathed a collective sigh of relief, helping along a 25% rally over just four days.\n\nThe US struck its first trade truce with China in May, with both sides agreeing to lower their respective tariff rates for a period of 90 days. The stock ended up rising 17% that week. There would be further agreements with China, but this initial one marked the biggest inflection point.\n\nEarly September: Tesla introduces possible $1 trillion pay package for Musk\n\nThe argument in favor of such a lucrative package was that the continued presence of Musk as CEO makes up a large chunk of the company's value.\n\nIts introduction showed Tesla's board was serious about keeping him around, which pleased investors. Shares rallied 17% over the following week. The package was ultimately approved in November, which also pushed the stock higher.\n\nMid September: Musk buys back a bunch of shares\n\nTalk about throwing fuel on the fire. Musk's decision to buy back $1 billion worth of Tesla stock ignited another leg higher, pushing shares 7% higher in a single session. They then climbed an additional 8% the following week.\n\nMusk being willing to spend his own money on Tesla stock signaled confidence in the business, and comfort with valuation levels.\n\nNovember: Fed comments clinch a December rate cut\n\nThe December rate cut may have come and gone as a relative formality, which makes it easy to forget that it was still in jeopardy as recently as mid-November. Then, New York Fed President John Williams sealed the deal with some commentary on Nov. 21. Tesla rallied sharply alongside the broader market, soaring 10% over the next week.\n\nIt's been mostly a straight shot higher to records since then.",

    "description": "Visa group president Oliver Jenkyn said one of his non-negotiable \"big rocks\"  is four hours of weekly learning on a topic he doesn't understand.",
    "fullText": "Visa group president Oliver Jenkyn told Business Insider he thinks about his schedule like a Mason jar filled with big rocks, small pebbles, and sand.\n\nIn his analogy, the big rocks represent the complex problems that Visa needs to solve, such as rolling out a new global program. The pebbles are the less complicated tasks, he said, such as pricing approvals. The sand is the \"small stuff,\" like replying to emails, Jenkyn said.\n\nIf you fill the Mason jar with sand first, there's no space left for the big rocks, Jenkyn said. So if he has to take a B+ on anything, it can't be on the big rocks — and he plans to keep prioritizing his most important agenda items, even if that means scoring lower on the small stuff.\n\nJenkyn, who is responsible for Visa's business in the 200+ countries and territories in which it operates globally, said he gets feedback in his performance review that he didn't respond to emails fast enough or didn't attend summer internship sessions.\n\n\"I'm like, 'yeah, by the way, just cut and paste that into next year's performance review, as well,'\" Jenkyn said.\n\nThe finance executive said that one of his non-negotiable \"big rocks\" involves four hours of weekly learning on a topic he wants to understand. It's the first item he adds to his rolling 18-month calendar every week, he said, and he typically schedules it on a Friday morning around 5:30 a.m., when he feels his \"freshest\" and when he can avoid interrupting calls, emails, or texts.\n\n\"I put that time in as a block, and no one can touch it. It's really as simple as that,\" Jenkyn said.\n\nThe key, he said, is resisting the urge to slip into other work during that time — or to trick yourself into making work-related decisions on a new concept. Whatever topic he picks has to be something he \"really, really, genuinely cannot understand,\" Jenkyn said.\n\nJenkyn chooses the weekly topic from a lengthy \"think\" section on his to-do list of concepts he doesn't understand, that directly or indirectly impact Visa and its clients.\n\nJenkyn said past subjects have included the Millennium Prize problems, the history of important companies and how they pivoted during critical moments, a deep dive into the technology of stablecoins, and the history of the semiconductor industry.\n\nJenkyn said the weekly habit dates back to his days at McKinsey, where he was a partner until 2009. The executive recounted an offsite, where the worldwide managing director told employees that clients pay them to \"solve their hardest problems,\" so they needed to carve out time to think about them.\n\nThe idea wasn't to use that time to build slides or do busy work, but to just think. Jenkyn said the managing director suggested spending more than four hours weekly on this, but that's what he stuck with.\n\nWhile there are some weeks he does more or less deep thinking, Jenkyn said he strives to consistently put in the four hours weekly. He compared the habit to working out.\n\n\"You know when you're skipping leg day,\" Jenkyn said.\n\nFor Jenkyn, the four hours reflect a larger commitment to promote a culture of continuous learning. It also lines up with what he looks for in prospective hires at the credit card giant. The finance executive said he seeks out curious candidates with a \"rigorous problem-solving capability.\"\n\n\"If people aren't willing to do that — not because they're getting forced to, because they want to do this, it's their personality — they're just not going to work in our company,\" Jenkyn said about dedicating four hours a week to learning new concepts.\n\nThe executive, who has been at Visa for just over 16 years, said that it may feel like a luxury to block off four hours to learn, but it's not. He said the skills that make people successful today will be \"obsolete\" in the next three to five years, so developing adaptability and a culture of learning is critical.\n\nJenkyn said the four hours of weekly learning have been a \"game changer\" in his career over time, and the \"only reason\" he has the job he has at Visa.\n\n\"It's a necessity. Otherwise, you're just not going to be that relevant,\" Jenkyn said.",

    "fullText": "NASA's new boss has reiterated the stakes for the lunar race between Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.\n\nOn his first day in the job, Jared Isaacman said the space agency would pick whichever company finished its moon lander first, out of Musk's SpaceX or Bezos' Blue Origin.\n\n\"I don't think it was lost on either vendor that whichever lander was available first to ensure that America achieves its strategic objectives on the moon is the one we were going to go with,\" Isaacman told Bloomberg TV on Thursday, a day after he was confirmed as NASA administrator by the US Senate.\n\nSpaceX and Blue Origin both hold contracts to build lunar landers for NASA to help carry astronauts to the surface of the moon.\n\nA modified version of SpaceX's massive Starship rocket is set to be used in 2027 for NASA's Artemis III mission, which aims to put astronauts back to the moon for the first time in over 50 years.\n\nIn October, however, then-acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy reopened SpaceX's lunar contract, stating that the company was \"behind schedule\" on its lander and suggesting that NASA could opt for Blue Origin's spacecraft for the historic mission instead.\n\nIsaacman flew two private missions as a SpaceX astronaut in 2021 and 2024 and took part in the first-ever commercial space walk.\n\nThe billionaire's connection to Musk almost cost him the top job at NASA, with Donald Trump temporarily withdrawing his nomination earlier this year amid a high-profile spat between the US president and the world's richest man.\n\nMusk also clashed with Isaacman's predecessor, Duffy, over the decision to reopen the moon contracts, calling the transport secretary a \"dummy\" and claiming that SpaceX would end up \"doing the whole moon mission\" by itself.\n\nIt comes after Trump signed a new executive order on Thursday that called on the US to establish a permanent outpost and nuclear reactors on the moon by 2030.",

    "description": "I'm a mother of 2 who works in a research lab. These are the STEM-based toys my kids have played with the most over the years.",
    "fullText": "It's exciting to shop for kids, especially around the holidays, but it can be overwhelming with all the options available. I'm a mom to a 3-year-old and a 6-year-old, and I work in a scientific research lab, so I gravitate toward toys that can be both educational and fun.\n\nOver the years, my kids have tried out a lot of STEM-based toys. These are the ones that they return to again and again, and they also happen to be ones that I know are challenging their brains in all the right ways.\n\nI bought this Highlights cookbook for my son last Easter, and have since purchased a handful more to gift to friends and relatives. My 6-year-old frequently requests to make recipes from this cookbook, which covers a wide range of scientific topics.\n\nEach recipe has a scientific description alongside it, and the recipes range from easy (building a pyramid with cheese cubes and grapes, teaching basic engineering skills) to multiple-step (think along the lines of chocolate chip cookies — an opportunity to talk about chemical reactions and how baking soda leavens the cookies), so there's something for everyone (even if you're not prepared!).\n\nMy parents have gifted a few Poraxy and Yutin STEM wood building kits — vehicles, more vehicles, and lanterns — to my kids. While geared more toward ages 8 and up, my younger kids enjoy making these kits with help from an adult.\n\nMany of the kits run on batteries, but there's also a solar-charged helicopter and car that you can use to discuss the differences in power, as well as the building concepts.\n\nThe Ferris wheel model uses slow gears and a fast motor, introducing gear speed reduction. The kits involve attaching wires (positive and negative) to battery power, teaching simple polarity (which end of the battery is positive or negative?). My kids enjoy playing with the vehicles, and the lanterns are often used at bedtime.\n\nMy kids often love to grab a Snap Circuit kit, labeled for ages 8 to 108, when we visit our local library. Our branch has the kit in a large plastic carrying case, available to check out upon request. I like to borrow the kit a few times a year as a special activity during school breaks or when the weather is poor, and my kids are always excited to bring it home.\n\nMy son and daughter are able to work on the circuit board with a little help from me. The kit has a variety of build setups, some reminiscent of physics labs I did in school, but you can also create your own setups.\n\nThis toy teaches how practical objects, such as an alarm, a switch, or a lightbulb, work. Beyond the basics of electricity, physics, and engineering, this kit also encourages critical thinking.\n\n\"Turn, Crank, Zoom!\" is a book that I have repeatedly bought as a gift for toddlers. The text encourages young readers to turn the gears in certain directions or ways to see what happens. The book focuses on colors and motor skills, evoking a sense of curiosity, while being illustrated in the Eric Carle style that kids gravitate toward.\n\nRecommended for ages 3 and up, Quercetti Kaleido Gears give kids the freedom to explore. The gears and axles attach to a board, which kids can connect to a crank to see simple mechanical reactions as the gears move.\n\nThese gears could make a great gift to accompany the Eric Carle book. There is also a boxed set aimed toward ages 5 to 12, which includes chains and other components that require finer motor skills. The kits are interchangeable, so both of my kids can play with the gears together.\n\nMarble run toys have been created in all sorts of designs, and my kids have access to multiple versions.\n\nMy son enjoys playing with a bath marble run set, which features pieces with suction cups that attach to the wall. The bath set requires more structural design planning than traditional marble runs, as the pieces must fit flat against the wall.\n\nOur friends own one of the more advanced GraviTrax marble run systems — those can be quite the puzzle, even as an adult! The junior GraviTrax set will be wrapped under our Christmas tree this year.",

    "fullText": "Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has mixed feelings about taking his company public.\n\n\"Am I excited for OpenAI to be a public company? In some ways, I am, and in some ways I think it'd be really annoying,\" Altman said on an episode of the \"Big Technology Podcast\" published Thursday.\n\nLeadership seems to be one of the sticking points for Altman: \"Am I excited to be a public company CEO? 0%.\"\n\n\"It's wonderful to be a private company,\" Altman said, but he added that OpenAI needs lots of capital and is going to \"cross all of the shareholder limits and stuff at some point.\"\n\n\"I do think it's cool that public markets get to participate in value creation,\" Altman said.\n\nAltman cofounded OpenAI alongside eleven others in 2015, and the company's value has soared since the launch of its AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT, in 2022.\n\nChatGPT has 800 million weekly users, and the company has inked $1 trillion worth of deals with tech giants like Oracle, Nvidia, and AMD.\n\nIn October, the company reached a $500 billion valuation after a secondary share sale, briefly overtaking Elon Musk's SpaceX to become the most valuable private company in the world, a crown that SpaceX regained in recent days.\n\nThe Information reported on Wednesday that OpenAI is seeking to raise billions more at a $750 billion valuation.\n\nThere are signs the company is preparing for a potential IPO. In October, Reuters reported that OpenAI is considering filing with securities regulators as soon as the second half of 2026.\n\nBut asked during the podcast if OpenAI would IPO next year, Altman responded, \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"We will be very late to go public,\" Altman added.",

The Schulz family owns the remaining 20%.\n\nPeanuts, which first appeared as a comic strip in seven newspapers in 1950 and ran daily until the cartoonist’s death in 2000, has gone on to become a global franchise spanning TV, toys, films and theme park attractions.\n\nIn October, Apple TV announced an extension of its deal as the exclusive streaming home for Peanuts until 2030, which includes the production of a new Snoopy and Charlie Brown animated feature film.\n\n20th Century Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios produced The Peanuts Movie in 2015.\n\nSony, whose empire spans film, television, music, gaming and electronics, has been bolstering its push into entertainment and original content in recent years.\n\nThe company achieved significant success with the TV series The Last of Us, which was adapted from a popular PlayStation game.\n\nIn the UK, Sony owns or has majority control of the TV production companies behind series including Downton Abbey, Outlander, Industry and His Dark Materials. Its film studio, Sony Pictures, is behind franchises including Spider-Man and Venom, and Sony Music is home to global artists including Beyoncé, Adele and Pink Floyd.\n\n“With this additional ownership stake we are thrilled to be able to further elevate the value of the Peanuts brand by drawing on Sony Group’s extensive global network and collective expertise,” said Shunsuke Muramatsu, the chief executive of Sony Music Entertainment.\n\n“We are deeply committed to carrying forward the legacy of Charles Schulz and the Schulz family.”\n\nSony said the publicly listed WildBrain would be retained under a multi-year service arrangement to handle licensing, production and distribution relating to the Peanuts franchise.\n\nWildBrain, which acquired its 80% stake in the Peanuts franchise in 2017, also owns intellectual property rights to franchises including Strawberry Shortcake, Teletubbies, Degrassi and Inspector Gadget.",

The catch is that, as England head coach, he hasn't seen much more of Palmer at international level - just 64 minutes in the World Cup qualifier win against Andorra in June.\n\nA lingering groin problem meant that, against Everton, Palmer was making only his fourth Premier League start of the season, scoring his first goal since September. And in his absence, Tuchel's options for the number 10 role have expanded.\n\nTuchel may have given a clue to his future thinking with the way he voted in that Fifa Best poll, placing England captain Harry Kane as top choice, followed by Palmer and Ballon d'Or winner Ousmane Dembele.\n\nPalmer offers England the X-factor.

    "fullText": "Lakers face Luka Doncic-LeBron James crossroads after JJ Redick's latest on-court experiment originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers pulled off one of the most groundbreaking trades just before the deadline last February. Acquiring Luka Dončić was one of the most shocking deals in NBA history. While the Lakers want to build around him—and understand that it may take time—Dončić still wants to win now.\n\n“Dončić being just 26 gives the Lakers a far longer timeline to build a championship-contending team, but that doesn't mean they can slow down and take their time. Dončić told Lakers president Rob Pelinka and coach JJ Redick in May that he's not interested in taking the slow approach in building a contender,” CBS Sports’ Jasmyn Wimbish wrote.\n\nLos Angeles got off to a hot start, but lately the team has become stagnant. Defense has been a major reason for that struggle. As a result, head coach JJ Redick reportedly called a meeting with Dončić and LeBron James, challenging them to step up on that end of the floor.\n\n“It was good. We talked about a lot - not just that. But he was right. You got to get a little bit more, especially from the star players. So that’s on us, that’s on me.” - Luka Dončić on JJ Redick’s recent meeting where he asked for more on the defensive end from him and LeBron,” Lakers insider Dave McMenamin posted.\n\nIt also appears that Redick is working to get Dončić more involved off the ball.\n\n“JJ just inferred that he's been trying to get Luka to play more off-ball, but he's been reluctant and uncomfortable. However he made some progress in that regard today. If Luka learns how to play off-ball, even a 10% increase would make the Lakers so much more dangerous,” Lakers Daily posted.\n\nWhile getting Dončić involved off the ball could benefit the offense, it may also signal that Redick is still searching for the best way to keep all of his stars engaged. LeBron James has yet to have a truly dominant game, and that could be due in part to not having the ball in his hands as often.\n\nRedick now appears to be at a crossroads as he works to maximize his roster. This is his current solution, but if Dončić is unwilling to fully embrace the change, the offense could suffer. If these issues aren’t addressed soon, they could quickly become a significant problem.",

This is the process we are doing. Now it is Manchester United.\"\n\nEmery conjured a victory against United at Villa Park in his first match in charge but that remains the only time Villa have beaten the Red Devils at home in the Premier League since 1995.\n\nThomas Frank admitted there was no \"quick fix\" at Tottenham after their painful 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest last week.\n\nBut how patient will the Spurs hierarchy be after just four wins in their past 14 games in all competitions.\n\nFans endured a terrible Premier League campaign under Ange Postecoglou last season, when the club finished 17th, but at least they were entertained and ultimately celebrated Europa League glory.\n\nThere has been little tangible progress under former Brentford boss Frank, whose 11th-placed team are hosting champions Liverpool.\n\nAfter 16 league games in 2024/25, Postecoglou's team had scored 11 more goals and conceded two fewer than Frank's side.\n\nStrikingly, only Everton, Sunderland and Wolves have had fewer shots on target than Tottenham, even though they reinforced their attack in the summer transfer window, bringing in Mohammed Kudus, Xavi Simons and Randal Kolo Muani.\n\nFrank is confident he will get the time to turn things around but the clock is ticking.\n\nSaturday (1500 GMT unless stated)\n\nNewcastle v Chelsea (1230), Bournemouth v Burnley, Brighton v Sunderland, Manchester City v West Ham, Wolves v Brentford, Tottenham v Liverpool (1730), Everton v Arsenal, Leeds v Crystal Palace (both 2000)\n\nAston Villa v Manchester United",

    "fullText": "Liverpool head to Tottenham this weekend carrying momentum, but also a growing sense of uncertainty that has caught the attention of one of the game’s most prominent voices. Speaking ahead of the trip to north London, Neville openly questioned whether Liverpool currently possess the authority and consistency required to win one of the Premier League’s most demanding away fixtures.\n\nThe Reds arrive in good form on paper, unbeaten in their last four league matches and fresh from a controlled victory over Brighton. Yet this fixture, against a Tottenham side unpredictable but dangerous at home, has divided opinion among pundits and supporters alike. Neville’s remarks crystallise a broader debate about where Liverpool truly stand at this stage of the season.\n\nNeville’s assessment was notable for its honesty rather than its certainty. He admitted difficulty in calling the outcome, initially leaning towards a draw before posing the central question: can Liverpool go there and win?\n\nThat hesitation speaks volumes. Tottenham’s home form has been erratic, but the fixture has historically been uncomfortable for visiting sides. For Liverpool, this match represents more than just three points. It is a barometer of progress under Arne Slot, whose side has prioritised control and structure over relentless dominance.\n\nNeville eventually shifted his stance towards a narrow Liverpool victory, though the lack of conviction remained clear. His uncertainty echoed the wider panel discussion, with predictions ranging from high-scoring draws to a tight away win. Such variation underlines how finely balanced this contest appears.\n\nLiverpool’s recent performances have been solid rather than spectacular. The win over Brighton was efficient, marked by defensive discipline and a composed display in possession. However, questions persist about whether that level translates seamlessly against elite opposition away from home.\n\nUnder Slot, Liverpool are showing signs of stability, but not yet the ruthless edge that once defined their peak years. The side is conceding fewer clear chances and managing games more effectively, yet moments of hesitation and missed opportunities have prevented them from pulling away from rivals in decisive fashion.\n\nThis is where Neville’s scepticism finds its footing. Tottenham, for all their flaws, remain capable of exploiting lapses, particularly in transition. Liverpool’s ability to maintain focus for the full ninety minutes will be critical.\n\nTottenham’s strengths and weaknesses make them a unique opponent. Their aggressive approach can leave space, but it also places immense physical and mental demands on visiting teams. For Liverpool, coping with that intensity while imposing their own game plan is the real test.\n\nJamie Carragher pointed to Tottenham’s struggles on home soil as a reason for optimism, while others predicted a goal-heavy draw. What is clear is that Liverpool will need more than control; they will need conviction.\n\nA positive result would reinforce the sense that Liverpool are edging towards something more substantial under Slot. A draw or defeat, however, would keep doubts alive and lend weight to Neville’s question.\n\nMatches like this often define seasons. Liverpool have the chance to send a message, not only to Tottenham but to the wider league, that their upward trajectory is real. Winning away against a direct rival would provide tangible proof of growth.\n\nNeville’s comments should be viewed less as criticism and more as a challenge. Liverpool have the tools, the form and the platform. What remains to be seen is whether they have the authority to impose themselves when the spotlight is brightest.\n\nSunday’s clash will not decide the title race, but it may shape perceptions. For Liverpool, that alone makes the trip to Tottenham unmissable.",

    "fullText": "Víctor Valdepenas is currently living a dream at Real Madrid. An academy player, who is a part of the Castilla setup currently, the teenage defender made his debut with the first team last Sunday at Mendizorroza against Alaves.\n\nThe 19-year-old talent started as the left-back for Real Madrid last weekend due to the absences of Alvaro Carreras and Fran Garcia through suspension, while Ferland Mendy was unavailable through injury.\n\nWith Carreras and Garcia ruled out against Sevilla as well and Mendy unlikely to return, Valdepenas could once again start for Real Madrid on Saturday night.\n\nNow, according to Mundo Deportivo, Real Madrid will improve the contract of Valdepenas by increasing his salary due to his good performances.\n\nThis was already planned even before his official first-team debut last Sunday at Mendizorroza. The length of his contract will not be changed and continues to run until 2029.\n\nValdepenas made his debut vs Alaves. (Photo by Juan Manuel Serrano Arce/Getty Images)\n\nValdepenas is considered one of the biggest prospects currently coming through the Real Madrid academy.\n\nThe versatile defender has played in 13 of the 16 league matches this season for Castilla, scoring and assisting one goal apiece. In addition, he has scored a goal from two UEFA Youth League matches and even featured once in the U21 Premier League International Cup.\n\nApart from having made his first-team debut, Valdepenas has also been included in the squad for the Champions League game vs Manchester City and the Copa del Rey clash against Talavera.\n\nGiven his talent and potential, Real Madrid will improve the versatile defender’s salary as a reward for his strong performances with Castilla.\n\nLast summer, clubs such as Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen and Arsenal made enquiries about Valdepenas and remain interested. It could be a factor behind Real Madrid offering him an improved deal.",

They are the ones who practice cynicism and disproportionate arrogance. They are the ones who have a disgraceful television program that only spews lies and constantly and permanently poisons the atmosphere. To them I say that Barça is strong again, both on and off the pitch,” he said.\n\n“The size we have generates an envy that is poorly handled by these people who, with underhanded tactics, disregard all codes of conduct, ethical and moral, and not just sporting ones, I mean in general.\n\n“I imagine you know who I am referring to, those who are the architects of permanent campaigns to discredit our badge and our essence, and we will not allow this.”\n\nLaporta also said that Madrid’s regular attacks will not harm Barcelona as he looked forward to a bright future for the club.\n\n“Together we know that in every sporting, social, institutional and even economic action we leave our mark, as a respected, recognized, admired and beloved club,” he added.\n\n“While they destroy and try to erase or distort history, they will not succeed. We are building, and we are building a glorious new chapter in Barça’s history that will once again reach glory and make history, and this is thanks to you, fundamentally.”",

    "description": "Lewis Steele provided insight into a wide array of subjects in a Q&A.",
    "fullText": "The Daily Mail’s Lewis Steele conducted a wide-ranging Q&A on Liverpool FC, covering transfers, contract renewals, and more. Let’s comb through the highlights.\n\nOn a potential Antoine Semenyo transfer, he had this to say:\n\n“Semenyo was certainly one that was talked about at Anfield at the start of the summer window. Now the only problem is there’s so many teams that are in for him.”\n\n“Can’t read it too much, but he gave tickets to his old friends for old Trafford game on Monday.”\n\n“But I think if Liverpool really wanted to do this sign and they could. And I think that with all due respect to Tottenham and Man United, I think if you’ve got them free in front of you, you choose Liverpool.”\n\nFor Marc Guehi, and if the transfer will happen, and if it’ll happen in January or the summer:\n\n“I still think Liverpool have a really good chance of signing Guehi. The only question is, is that in January for a fee or is that in the summer for nothing?”\n\n“I think Guehi himself would rather it be in the summer. He’s playing in Europe for the 1st time with Crystal Palace, I think he feels a bit of a loyalty to not leave midseason and also if he leaves on a free, then he gets good money in terms of the wages.”\n\n“Liverpool aren’t the only team in for him, we know Bayern Munich is sniffing around. Manchester City, Real Madrid would like to have a go as well.”\n\n“But I just wonder whether there’s a sort of under the table, gentlemen’s agreement between Liverpool and Guehi, from September the 1st or whatever date it was, because they were literally that close to him signing.”\n\n“I think Liverpool have every chance. The word from the club may be caution over a January transfer, but on August the 30th, the word from the club was not going to sign Alexander Isak and look what happened there.”\n\n“So I think Liverpool have every chance of getting him in January. If not, the summer.”\n\nSteele was also asked about the murmurs that have been circulating about Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton:\n\n“Nothing imminent. I can’t see Liverpool signing a midfielder in January. But I think Adam Wharton certainly has his admirers at Anfield, and he could be one to watch for the summer.”\n\nHarvey Elliott’s bizarre loan to Aston Villa, where he hasn’t played since October, was also addressed:\n\n“The clubs could shake hands in January on terminating the loan agreement, it doesn’t really benefit anyone.”\n\nWhen asked if Arne Slot was frustrated by the failure of recruitment to get any transfer deal over the line, Steele said:\n\n“I don’t think there’s any frustration from Slot. It’s easy to say in hindsight, but I think Slot was perfectly happy with the window. “\n\nOn contract renewals, Ibrahima Konaté’s situation doesn’t seem to have changed much, even with Real Madrid pulling out of the race to sign him:\n\n“Konate and Liverpool have been in talks over a new deal for nearly 18 months. So far, they have been very far apart.”\n\n“We haven’t really ever heard from Konate whether he actually is all in on wanting to stay at Liverpool. Although interest from Madrid has become weaken, PSG would always appeal to him for his nationality, I’m sure that they would maybe consider it if they got some encouragement, but as of yet, it does seem more likely than not that he would be at Liverpool.”\n\n“I don’t think that Liverpool would be removing any contract offering.”\n\nAlso on contract renewals, early talks have begun for key midfielders Dominik Szoboszlai, Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister:\n\n“There are talks underway, very preliminary talk, but I think Liverpool are keen to extend all 3 of those deals.”\n\nLast but not least, Steele answered some questions about the status of some squad members, including injured players, and the ones on the periphery of the squad. For Jeremie Frimpong, who is nearing a return:\n\n“Very, very soon. Maybe not quite ready to play at the weekend, but I think he’ll be back in full training in the next couple of days, certainly in the next week, he’s been back in the grass for a while now doing some 1v1 gym stuff as well.”\n\nSteele had a very interesting answer concerning Federico Chiesa, and his inability to get any starts:\n\n“Slot, wouldn’t mind me saying it, just doesn’t seem like he trusts him(Chiesa). That’s just a guess that I got because I know when they lost at Plymouth, Slot was furious with Chiesa. He was one of the senior players on that day and he just didn’t seem to (perform), a few people have said how frustrated Slot was.”\n\n“I just think what Chiesa has to do is,to prove to Arne Slot that he deserves a chance because if you lose in every game, you can’t get a game. Then you sort of think that maybe he doesn’t like him at all.“\n\nIt seems to me like Chiesa could come off the bench and score every week. He still wouldn’t play.”\n\nThe Plymouth game stuck out in my mind for a while after it happened, but he’s had so many key moments after that so it’s bizarre. But I’m also not a professional football coach so…\n\nOn the status of Stefan Bajcetic and Jayden Danns, who are working their way back from surgeries:\n\n“Stefan Bajcetic has been back on the grass at certain points of the last month.And I think the plan is to maybe get him into U21 for a bit. Jayden Danns is also stepping up his recovery. “\n\nWell, that was a buffet of information. Liverpool play Tottenham Hotspur next on Saturday in North London. Up the Reds.",

    "fullText": "Heading into Thursday night, the Golden State Warriors were riding a two-game losing streak. In each game, the Warriors held a lead in the fourth quarter, but struggled down the stretch on the way to losses.\n\nOn Thursday against the Phoenix Suns, the Warriors failed to close again, despite a heroic performance from Jimmy Butler. Behind Butler, the Warriors built a seven-point lead at halftime, yet heading into the fourth quarter, their lead dwindled down to one.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the Suns took control as momentum swung their way. Yet, Butler, Steph Curry and the Warriors wouldn't go away. In the final minute, the Suns led by five points before Dillon Brooks committed a flagrant foul on Curry, sending him to the line for a pair of free throws. After the free throws from Curry, Butler knocked down a clutch 3-pointer to tie the game at 96. After Booker and Curry traded buckets to tie the game again at 98, Moses Moody committed a late foul on Jordan Goodwin in the final second of the game. Goodwin missed the first attempt from the line before hitting the game-winning free throw and dealt the Warriors their third straight loss, 99-98.\n\nButler finished with a game-high 31 points on 11-of-17 shooting from the field with three assists and three rebounds in 34 minutes. Butler's performance on Thursday night in Phoenix was his third game of the season scoring 30 or more points. Thursday also marked his highest scoring mark in a month.\n\nAlongside Butler, Brandin Podziemski put together a strong performance on Thursday, scoring 18 points on 8-of-11 shooting from the field with a pair of made 3-pointers in 28 minutes off the bench.\n\nWhile Podziemski and Butler helped fuel Golden State's offense, Steph Curry struggled, scoring 15 points on 3-of-13 shooting from the field and 2-of-9 from deep. Butler, Podziemski and Curry were the only members of the Warriors to tally double-figure scoring numbers. Draymond Green committed five of Golden State's 20 turnovers.\n\nAfter their third straight loss, the Warriors have fallen to 13-15 on the season. The Warriors will get the chance to avenge their loss from Thursday when the Suns travel back to the Bay Area on Saturday for a rematch at Chase Center.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Warriors Wire! \n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Late free throws from Suns helps deal Warriors' third straight loss",

    "fullText": "Alarm bells started ringing within the halls of Manchester United when the recent interview of Bruno Fernandes began airing.\n\nThe club captain hinted at INEOS being open to the idea of letting him leave in the summer, but Ruben Amorim and the midfielder’s family asked the 31-year-old to stay put.\n\nThe co-owners were not pleased with the revelation, and plenty of players in the squad feel the Portugal international might be playing at Old Trafford for the final season.\n\nSaudi Pro League sides are expected to return once the summer window opens, while European clubs are also keeping a watch on proceedings.\n\nHowever, Bruno Fernandes has come out and allayed those fears, claiming he still feels he can win it all for United. And he also revealed that INEOS are also on the same page.\n\nAnd the 31-year-old feels obligated to help return the club to the heights the fans used to experience almost year back when Sir Alex Ferguson was boss.\n\n“Obviously, when I speak about going and winning trophies, I stayed here because I think I still can win trophies here,” he told on Rio Ferdinand’s podcast.\n\n“I wouldn’t have stayed here if the club hasn’t told me our aim is still to get the highest we can be, get back to winning trophies, get back to be the club we were before.\n\n“Because if that was not the aim then, yes, I wouldn’t have stayed here.\n\n“But [it’s] because I know the aim of the club is still to get back to where they want to be, and where I want the club to be, and that’s why I came to the club in the first place.\n\n“So, if I can help to get back there, that’s all I want to do.”\n\nUnited are currently sixth, only two points from fourth position. Returning to the Champions League should be the first step to realising those dreams.\n\nFeature image Shaun Botterill via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "FC Barcelona face off against an injury-riddled Villarreal away at Estadio La Ceramica in their final La Liga clash before the mid-season Christmas break.\n\nThe contest will take place on Sunday evening, with Barça hoping to go into the break on a winning note, with their healthy lead at the top of the league table intact.\n\nLeading up to the game, SPORT reports that Barcelona manager Hansi Flick is set to make some changes to the team’s pre-match routine before facing Villarreal.\n\nIn the build-up to La Liga matches, whether played at home or away, Barcelona usually follow the same routine. A morning training session at 11 am is held, followed by a press conference from Flick to address the media at 1 pm.\n\nIn the Champions League, there are usually some changes, as the structure and organisation of the competition require it.\n\nHansi Flick has changed things with Barcelona’s pre-match routine. (Photo by Alex Caparros/Getty Images)\n\nHowever, ahead of the final league match of the year, which Barcelona will play at La Ceramica against Villarreal this Sunday, the schedule will also be slightly different.\n\nThe training session, normally held in the morning, will be moved to the afternoon, taking place immediately after the German tactician’s press conference, which will take place at its usual time.\n\nThe reason for this change is that, once the training session at the Ciutat Esportiva has finished, the team will board a plane to spend Saturday night in the province of Castellon.\n\nBarcelona face the Yellow Submarine at 4:15 pm on Sunday, a kick-off time which, in order to avoid any setbacks, requires the squad to travel a day earlier.\n\nAs a result, the final training session has also been moved to the afternoon, before the team begin their journey to Villarreal.",

    "description": "Here are the options that Missouri football could explore at quarterback in the transfer portal.",
    "fullText": "Missouri football is almost certainly going to turn to the transfer portal for a quarterback. A team spokesperson confirmed to the Columbia Daily Tribune on Thursday that starting quarterback Beau Pribula intends to transfer this offseason. The college football transfer portal officially opens Jan. 2.\n\nNow, Mizzou doesn’t necessarily need a starter. Talented true freshman Matt Zollers is going to start for the Tigers against Virginia in the Gator Bowl on Dec. 27 in Jacksonville, Florida, for his third start with the program.\n\nMissouri may well stick with Zollers moving forward.\n\nBut, at the very least, depth is an issue in Columbia heading into 2026. Zollers and incoming true freshman Gavin Sidwar are the only scholarship quarterbacks currently expected to be on the roster next season.\n\nMizzou definitely needs depth. It might want a starter.\n\nHere are nine players who are currently expected to enter the transfer portal, with three players we think could come in and be instant starters, three would likely be competition and three who likely would be depth behind Zollers:\n\nThe following players are the current high-profile options expected to enter the portal. The expectation would be that they could arrive and immediately start.\n\nThe general consensus appears to be that Sorsby, if not NFL-bound, is making his way to Lubbock, Texas, to join the big-spending Texas Tech Red Raiders. That shouldn’t dissuade teams looking for a starter, like Mizzou. The Denton, Texas, native threw for 2,800 yards, 27 touchdowns and five picks this season and also rushed for 580 yards and nine scores.\n\nEveryone and their dog expects Mestemaker to follow his head coach, Eric Morris, from North Texas to Oklahoma State when the portal opens. But … it’s not quite so cut and dry, according to a report from Matt Zenitz at 247Sports. If there’s a window to try and land Mestemaker, there’s an FBS-leading 4,129 passing yards and 31 touchdowns worth of a reason to enter the bidding war.\n\nThis is an expensive option. The demand will be extremely high for the former five-star prospect. But, he’s in the portal and has a high ceiling, so he’s certainly worth considering. He threw for 2,000 yards, 18 touchdowns and six interceptions this season.\n\nMore: Matt Zollers, big-name transfer or other for Missouri football at QB?\n\nAlways compete, as the coaches say. Interest will be high in these players, and Mizzou could offer a chance to come in and battle with Zollers for the starting job.\n\nJoseph had an excellent season at ODU and fits the recent Mizzou mold of a dual-threat. He threw for 2,624 yards, 24 touchdowns and 10 picks, and he added 1,007 rushing yards with 13 touchdowns.\n\nThe former Michigan State quarterback beat out former Mizzou player Jake Garcia for the starting job at ECU and had a bit of a comeback year in 2025. He threw for 3,300 yards, 19 touchdowns and six picks, and his offensive coordinator has since been hired as the playcaller at Ole Miss.\n\nUnlikely to be starters, but solid or intriguing depth pieces that shouldn’t run the risk of running Zollers off.\n\nDickens is a finalist for the Walter Payton Award, which is given to the most outstanding offensive player at the FCS level. He threw for 3,508 yards, 38 touchdowns and two interceptions this season — in nine games. He passed for more yards (582) in a game against Stanford than Texas A&M had total offensive yards (478) against the Bulldogs this year. Worth a look, surely.\n\nCraig has a lot of experience at the FCS level with Harvard, with 28-career games, more than 6,000 passing yards, 52-career touchdowns and 12 interceptions. He has one year of eligibility left.\n\nMore: What Missouri football fans need to know about new transfer portal dates\n\nMore: Will Jamal Roberts return to Missouri football? Eli Drinkwitz makes plea\n\nMaybe we’re prisoners of the Trinidad Chambliss moment, but Stokes is a Harlon Hill finalist — the Division-II equivalent of the Heisman Trophy — and put up some some big passing numbers for Division-II West Florida. He threw for 3,297 yards, 30 touchdowns and 13 picks.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Columbia Daily Tribune: Here are Missouri football’s current transfer portal QB options",

    "description": "Commanders coach Dan Quinn hinted at his earlier disappointment in Brandon Coleman, but loves how he has responded ahead of his start vs. Eagles.",
    "fullText": "Seeing Laremy Tunsil has clearly been the Washington Commanders' MVP this season, with his effective play. What does his absence mean for the Eagles' game at Northwest Stadium, Saturday at 5 p.m. ET?\n\nBrandon Coleman, who had started the season at left guard, then lost his job to Chris Paul, was forced into action replacing Tunsil last Sunday in New York. It was the second time for Coleman to take over for Tunsil. He was also Tunsil's replacement against Kansas City when Tunsil went down with a hamstring injury.\n\n\"I think it's really important and the identity piece,\" head coach Dan Quinn said on Thursday. \"And that's what these three weeks are, to me, and why having three division games is so important for us to recapture that north. Yeah, Laremy has been a big part of everything. Run game, pass protection, and so his ability to displace people from the line down on double teams, and Brandon, I thought, really, he had been ready, he was ready, he looked ready, you know, and performed that way.\"\n\nQuinn was asked what he had seen from Coleman over the past few weeks. Here is how Quinn responded. Let's see if you think Quinn was saying he was initially disappointed that Coleman didn't win back that spot from Chris Paul.\n\n\"Yeah, and that's the one spot we haven't been banged up on in that space. And so, obviously disappointed when Chris stepped in and stayed into that space.\"\n\nThe Commanders' head coach then praised the fact that Coleman had been asked to play guard and tackle and had been productive as an extra tight end in some sets. \"But then I also saw a guy working guard and tackle. He’s been our jumbo, you know, so there's some things like, ‘Hey, let's get him back in the fight, get him back into it.'\"\n\nDaniels to Noah Brown at the goal line - but LOOK at the block by the rookie Brandon Coleman here 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻 pic.twitter.com/MDjuHb2f5i\n\n— Mark Tyler (Hogs Haven) (@Tiller56) September 24, 2024\n\nReferring to getting Coleman back into it, well, weren't the Commanders designating Coleman a healthy inactive scratch? They certainly did for five consecutive games, and the only comment they offered was that it was a coach's decision, not an injury-related one.\n\nYet on Thursday, Quinn expressed that he has recently liked the work he has seen from Coleman. \"I saw good practice habits number one. So, I wasn't surprised that he performed well because this wasn't a guy that put his head down and sulked about it.\"\n\nCoaches make decisions that players sometimes understand and sometimes don't, so it can be frustrating for the players. \"It's not always smooth, but I thought that showed a lot about his resilience to say, ‘Okay, yeah, these are not the circumstances that I want, but I'm going to go battle for it.'\"\n\nTo truly be ready when your name is called, a player must do the classroom work, the field work, and be prepared. Quinn feels Coleman has done just that. \"When called or if called, he would show and demonstrate that he was ready... You have to put the work in to do that. And I've certainly seen that from BC.\"\n\nColeman has played in nine games this season. Saturday will be his first start since the first two games of the season against the Giants and Packers. In both of those games, he was the starting left guard.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Brandon Coleman has massive Week 16 opportunity",

    "description": "YouTuber-turned-boxer Paul and former world heavyweight champion Joshua will clash on 19 December",
    "fullText": "Jake Paul and Anthony Joshua will square off in a strange fight tonight, pitting a YouTuber-turned-boxer against a former two-time world heavyweight champion.\n\nJoshua is the latter, to avoid any confusion, with the Briton entering Friday’s fight in Miami as a huge favourite. “AJ” holds standout victories over the likes of Wladimir Klitschko, Joseph Parker, Kubrat Pulev, Dillian Whyte and Alexander Povetkin. However, the 36-year-old is entering this bout, which streams live on Netflix, on the back of a brutal stoppage loss to Daniel Dubois in September 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, Paul comes into this contest – a professional bout, with knockouts allowed and standard 10oz gloves in use – with a 12-1 pro record. The American, 28, last fought in June and outpointed former world middleweight champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr, following a decision win over heavyweight legend Mike Tyson last November.\n\nTyson was 58 at the time, with the fight proving controversial to fans and pundits but lucrative to the boxers; Paul reportedly took home $40m and Tyson $20m.\n\nNow, Paul and Joshua will seemingly clear even Paul’s payday from that bout – and by some distance.\n\nIn the days leading up to the confirmation of this bout in November, the Daily Mail reported, “Sources tell us that a gargantuan prize pot of around £140m [$184m] has been mooted,” seemingly to be split evenly between Joshua and Paul. However, Paul later took to X (formerly Twitter) with a different figure, seemingly referencing the fight purse.\n\nSeveral days after the Mail’s report was published, Paul tweeted: “Stop asking me. $267 Million.” That works out at approximately £200m.\n\nSports and entertainment accountant Oriana Morrison told The Independent on Tuesday: “Even if the lower figure – the rumoured $184m purse – is true, AJ could bring home $92m [£70m]. We haven’t seen a boxing match with a purse at this level since Mayweather vs Pacquiao in 2015 or even Mayweather vs McGregor in 2017. It’s higher than any Saudi purse to date.”\n\nMorrison, who was referencing Floyd Mayweather’s bouts with Manny Pacquiao and Conor McGregor, continued: “The US never really got the chance to savour Anthony Joshua’s talent and charisma. This is the perfect setting for this fight and definitely a turning point for boxing in the US.\n\n“MVP [Most Valuable Promotions, Paul’s company] and Jake Paul are dragging new audiences into boxing. They’re forcing boxing to modernise its promotion and pay fighters better than established promoters.”",

    "description": "Joe Tiller took his Boilermakers on a trip to Pasadena, California, several years before they eventually made the Rose Bowl. More on that foundational moment:",
    "fullText": "Editor's note: This story is the third in a series related to Purdue's 2000 football season.\n\nIt's Sept. 13, 2025, a date several members of Purdue football's 2000 Big Ten championship team had eagerly awaited for weeks.\n\nThe Boilermakers are hosting USC and, for a bunch of guys who last suited up for the Boilermakers more than two decades earlier, this is a full circle moment.\n\nThe two programs hadn't played since the 1998 season opener in Los Angeles.\n\nPurdue lost that game 27 years ago, but what many who were there remember is the day after. Coach Joe Tiller had a planned field trip the players weren't looped in about.\n\n\"This was way out of the norm for coach Tiller. He was football, strictly business,\" safety Ben Smith said. \"For him to, one, not make us fly back after the game and, two, take us to the Rose Bowl, we had no idea where we were going.\n\n\"We show up there and there’s the neon lights. He gave us the old coach fire up talk and said, 'Guys, I want you to go out there and feel the grass, look in the stands. I want you to go in the press box and walk around this place and envision before you’re done playing here, playing in the Rose Bowl.'\"\n\nTwo years later, Tiller's Boilermakers finished in a three-way tie for the Big Ten title and were the league's representative to play Washington in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1, 2001.\n\nSurvey Purdue's roster during that time period and you'll get various answers on the program-shifting moment that resulted in that Rose Bowl trip. For some, it's that game at USC. Others say Purdue's upset of No. 4 Kansas State in the 1998 Alamo Bowl.\n\nTiller's second game as Boilermaker coach on Sept. 13, 1997. The roster was a blend of Jim Colletto recruits, who'd been a part of a 3-8 team the season before, and the Big Ten's lowest-rated recruiting class.\n\n\"I was in coach Tiller’s first class. So prior to us getting there, they were nothing,\" safety Tim Upshur said. \"And I'll never forget our first game we played my freshman year was Toledo.\n\nPart 1: How coach Joe Tiller laid foundation for Purdue football's 2000 Rose Bowl team\n\nPart 2: Joe Tiller's coaching staff was 'equally as good' as Purdue football Rose Bowl team\n\nTo outsiders, it was same old Purdue. Tiller's postgame message was a sign these Boilermakers were anything but.\n\n\"We've got some work to do,\" he told the team.\n\nTiller also said the team Purdue would beat Notre Dame the following game. Whether he believed it or not is irrelevant. The players believed that Tiller believed. And then they believed.\n\nPurdue beat Notre Dame for the first time since 1985 in Tiller's second game as head coach on Sept. 13, 1997, seven days after losing his first to Toledo.\n\n\"It goes back to that cultural shift,\" offensive lineman Chukky Okobi said. \"You go back to '96 and we can’t beat anybody and all the sudden we beat Notre Dame in '97. What else can we do? That kind of became the mindset going forward. If we can beat this team, there’s no reason we can’t beat every team.\"\n\nWest Lafayette was abuzz over its football program for the first time in years.\n\n\"The first game I ever dressed for was '97 against Notre Dame and that was the infamous (game). We win and they throw the goal post in the Wabash (River),\" punter Scott Kurz said. \"We enjoyed the energy our fans brought. It caught a lot of teams off guard and it was a real special memory for all of us.\"\n\nNotre Dame was the first of six consecutive wins in what became a 9-3 season, capped by beating Oklahoma State in the Alamo Bowl.\n\nBetween 1997-99, Purdue, which hadn't posted a winning record since 1984 previously, went a combined 25-12.\n\n\"That's where the great deal of pride I have in this institution today is because I felt like I was a part of turning the tide and changing the narrative of what Purdue football is, what it was and would it could be,\" said former cornerback Lamar Conard, who was Purdue's running backs coach until a few weeks ago, and whose last season playing was 1999.\n\nAll that did was up the ante for that 2000 season, when Tiller's first Purdue recruits would be seniors.\n\n\"I remember our recruiting class coming in 1997, we were the last-place ranked recruiting class (in the Big Ten) coming in,\" quarterback Drew Brees said in an interview with Journal & Courier in 2015. \"But we made a commitment to one another that by the time we left Purdue, we were going to be Big Ten champs and we were going to the Rose Bowl. That’s exactly what we had the chance to do.\"\n\nNathan Baird and Sam King have the best Purdue sports coverage, and \n\nThis article originally appeared on Indianapolis Star: Purdue football trip to Rose Bowl helped them envision Rose Bowl berth",

    "description": "'Pretty cool' said Hall after being named the country's top high school para track athlete",
    "fullText": "Several weeks ago, USA Track and Field sent out a survey to several athletes asking whether they'd like to be considered for All-American honors.\n\nThe email popped into Violet Hall's inbox. The Bloomington South senior figured she was one of hundreds, maybe thousands, to get the query, especially after finding out a couple of friends she'd made while competing in Para track meets over the summer received them as well.\n\nBasically spam, she thought. But, she filled it out, sent it back and forgot all about it.\n\nA couple of days ago, the USATF responded. Hall's friend sent his Para High School All-American certificate, which listed his events. Hall got one too, but hers was different.\n\n\"It said, 'Female Athlete of the Year,\" Hall said. \"I said, 'Wait, why is mine different?' I sent it to him, and he said, \"Read it. It literally says I won Track Athlete of the Year.' I didn't know. I was confused and then it hit me.\n\n\"I sent a screen shot to my parents. Pretty cool.\"\n\nI am truly grateful and honored to be selected for the USATF Para High School All-American Team and to receive the Female Track Athlete of the Year award. Thank you for this incredible recognition and support!@usatf @USParaTF @JimGordillo @BHSS_Athletics pic.twitter.com/stFEPC3MBL\n\n— Violet Hall (@violethall2026) December 15, 2025\n\nPretty cool indeed for Hall, who was one of two high schoolers invited to represent Team USA in track at the Para World Games in New Delhi, India in September.\n\nShe qualified in the 100 and 200 dashes in the T47 category. She was fifth in the 200, lowering her PR to 25.50 in the semifinals, and was eighth in the 100 in 12.62.\n\nThe trip was a memorable one, though she and her father, who accompanied her, saw more of the inside of her hotel than any tourist traps. Hall spent much of her downtime between her four races, catching up on homework and applying to college.\n\n\"Stuff I would have been doing at home,\" said Hall, who also hit up the hotel pool a few times, the average high that time of year in the mid-90s and lows in the 70s.\n\nTeam USA did set up a few trips as a group, but mostly it was a business trip, taking care to eat food prepared for the team to make sure no one got sick.\n\nFor her, the experience was everything as a first-time Para World Champ participant. She tried not to put any pressure on herself as a first-timer, just happy to be there and trying to do her best. If she got a medal, great. If not, it was huge just to be there.\n\n\"For me, it was more just an experience-building thing,\" Hall said. \"Running against people who have competed in Para circuits and worlds and Paralympics multiple times for 5-10 years.\n\n\"So being young an able to get to that point, I have so much more to prove, so much more to do for myself. I hope I can make a big difference and continue to grow.\"\n\nShe has certainly increased her circle of friends in the sport.\n\n\"Probably just meeting everyone and competing at that level,\" Hall said of the best thing about her trip. \"Going into it, I had been watching those people race and I was on the line with them. It all happened so fast.\"\n\nHall's first Para races took place early in the summer after the IHSAA state track meet ended. Three months later, she was in a massive stadium in India representing her country in a pro-like atmosphere.\n\n\"The call room air felt a lot heavier,\" Hall said. \"Not just because of the pressure, but it was also hot. They had fans going and I was sitting right next to one.\n\n\"Everyone was in their own bubble. Almost no one was talking. All you could hear was the fans.\"\n\nMore: South's Jasmine Martoglio leads All-Area Girls Cross Country Team\n\nMore: North's Jacob Mitchell leads IHSAA All-Area Boys Cross Country team\n\nAnd after the developments of the past few months, she might be playing for a different set of fans at the college level than what she had envisioned a year ago. Basketball was her main sport and it's still important as South has it's sights set high this season. But track seems more likely in the future.\n\n\"It's definitely been a big change, a big shift, from basketball,\" Hall said. \"Going into my junior year, I wouldn't have expected everything to have happened to happen.\n\n\"I'm just extremely grateful for the opportunities I've been provided, and grateful God led me through it. I'm just very happy to get to where I am today and excited to continue.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Herald-Times: South para-athlete Violet Hall earns top award from USATF",

    "fullText": "In a recent interview with DJMario (h/t SPORT), former Real Madrid defender and club legend Marcelo has named the one Barcelona player he would bring to the Santiago Bernabeu.\n\nThe former left-back, who announced his retirement from football earlier this year, named Pedri as his pick ahead of 2025 Ballon d’Or runner-up Lamine Yamal, claiming that the Barcelona midfield maestro had that bit of ‘Madrid quality’ in him.\n\n“Right now, I would sign Pedri for Madrid. He has that Madrid quality. Everyone would say Lamine, but I think Pedri would be a better signing,” said Marcelo.\n\nPedri has been a key player for Barcelona in recent seasons and was one of the chief driving forces behind their successful 2024/25 campaign under Hansi Flick.\n\nInterestingly, the 23-year-old Spanish international could have been a Real Madrid player, with the club having offered him a trial in the past, only to turn him down.\n\nMarcelo would sign Pedri for Real Madrid. (Photo by Angel Martinez/Getty Images)\n\n“When I took the test at Valdebebas it was strange; they told me I wasn’t up to standard and I went home,“ Pedri revealed during an interview about his trial at Real Madrid.\n\nSpeaking about his career in football, Marcelo recalled some of the toughest opponents he faced and took a clear stance in favour of Cristiano Ronaldo in the debate against Lionel Messi.\n\n“Messi was very tough. Jesus Navas also made it very difficult for me, and I found Xabi Prieto very difficult to defend against too. Pedrito was also very good,” said Marcelo.\n\n“I’ll always go with Cristiano. Messi is incredible. We’ve enjoyed both of them, well, I’ve only enjoyed one. I’m a die-hard Cristiano fan,” he noted.\n\nEven though it has been a few years since he left the club, the Marcelo family legacy will continue through his son Enzo, who plays in the Real Madrid youth ranks and is an international with Spain.\n\n“Enzo is doing well. He feels the pressure of being my son, but as he has grown up in the Madrid dressing room, he is now realising who the players are. They have seen him grow up, they have taken him under their wing,” said Marcelo.\n\n“Now he realises that what he has experienced is not normal. He is happy and content. I love that he is playing for Spain. The national team has been very good to us. They are very fond of my son. He made the decision and he’s very happy,” he concluded.",

    "description": "FC Bayern is in debt to Karl-Heinz Rummenigge…",
    "fullText": "There is a long and deep history between Uli Hoeneß and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge at Bayern Munich. Recently, Hoeneß took some time to talk through just how much Rummenigge has meant to the club, including how he helped reshape the club’s future by leaving for Inter Milan.\n\n“I experienced pretty much everything you can experience with him. He came to FC Bayern as a young player in 1974, shortly after we had won the World Cup. We welcomed him back then. He was an incredible dribbler, but a bit nervous at first, so the goals didn’t come right away. But he matured into an absolute world-class player at FC Bayern and in the national team. He later continued his career at Inter Milan and in Geneva,” Hoeneß told Sport1’s Stefan Kumberger (as captured by @iMiaSanMia). “When I became manager, FC Bayern had debts of around seven million marks. Through his transfer – that was about eleven million marks at the time – then we became debt-free. With the remaining four million, I then signed Lothar Matthäus for two million and Roland Wohlfarth for one million. The remaining million was used to create FC Bayern’s fixed deposit account. We must be infinitely grateful to Karl-Heinz for that. His transfer helped FC Bayern get healthy.”\n\nThese days, it is hard to imagine a Bayern Munich without either man. Though they have pledged to remain on the supervisory board until the club is “ready”, the day will arrive where both are fully out of the mix.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…",

    "description": "Proposed development at Parnham House is being opposed by conservationists who say a rescued albino is living in a meadow on the estate",
    "fullText": "Plans for the £25 million restoration of a 16th-century stately home could be scuppered by claims that an albino badger named Alberto is living nearby.\n\nThe badger is said to be living in a meadow alongside the River Brit in Dorset, having been rescued by wildlife volunteers in 2015 because he was being attacked by other badgers due to his unusual colour. He has since been joined by a family of albino badgers.\n\nConservationists fear that the “quiet, undisturbed” Millground meadow the badgers call home will be bulldozed to make way for a housing development to fund the restoration of Parnham House.\n\nThe grade I listed Elizabethan manor house was destroyed in a fire believed to have been deliberately started by its former owner Michael Treichl in 2017.\n\nJames Perkins, an entrepreneur, bought the house in 2020, vowing to restore it to its former glory.\n\nHe intends to build 82 homes and two visitor accommodation lodges on the sprawling country estate, near Beaminster, to fund the £25 million restoration of the south wing as “a private home with a hospitality offering”.\n\nThe Dorset Natural Heritage Initiative, which is campaigning against the development, said: “Millground meadow isn’t just a green space, it’s home to one of the UK’s rarest sights: a regular population of albino badgers.\n\n“Beaminster first grew attached to Alberto, an injured albino badger which was rescued back in 2015, but he’s no longer alone.\n\n“These pale, pink-eyed badgers now rely on the meadow’s quiet, undisturbed habitat to survive — occasionally visiting the houses dotted along this stretch of the River Brit.\n\n“Badgers and other wildlife were the winners in the Covid lockdowns, taking advantage of the resultant peace and quiet to explore and thrive in their reclaimed territories. It now looks like that peace could be shattered for ever.\n\n“The proposed Parnham housing development will bulldoze the meadow area to erect a dozen £1.25 million townhouses along with a £2 million road bridge across the river — threatening to destroy this fragile environment.”\n\nColin Varndell, a local resident, said the meadow was a haven for lots of wildlife, including barn owls, otters, grass snakes and dormice.\n\nHe said: “I am not interested in saving the house — that can fall down as far as I am concerned — but it would be catastrophic for nature.”\n\nPlanning documents state that the housing development would be inspired by Poundbury, the King’s model town built on Duchy of Cornwall land near Dorchester.\n\nThe planning agents said the development “has been very carefully sited to sit sympathetically within the estate to ensure that it does not have an undue impact on the setting of Parnham House, nor on views into the site from the surrounding landscape”.\n\nEd Grant, senior project manager of the Parnham Park estate, said: “There is zero evidence of any badgers within 30 metres of the proposals, as documented in the application and surveyed by specialist consultants.\n\n“The evidence of a single albino badger in Beaminster was in 2015 and not on our estate. I am sure you have seen the articles from then and sadly that badger died.\n\n“We have consistently endeavoured to try to speak with the group who are spreading misinformation, to have a constructive conversation about the proposals, but they have refused.”",

    "description": "The Roman soldiers posted to hold off invaders were riddled with intestinal parasites, analysis of latrine drains at Vindolanda in Northumberland shows",
    "fullText": "WH Auden’s poem about a miserable Roman soldier guarding a rain-soaked frontier in northern Europe mentions “lice in my tunic and a cold in my nose”. It seems the poet could have added serious stomach trouble to that catalogue of woes.\n\nAnalysis of sewer drains from the Roman fort of Vindolanda, close to Hadrian’s Wall, has shown that the occupants were riddled by three types of intestinal parasite: roundworm, whipworm and Giardia duodenalis. All are spread through the contamination of food, drink or hands by human faeces.\n\nThe findings may add a new dimension to impressions of life defending the northern edge of Rome’s dominions. “The three types of parasites we found could have led to malnutrition [and] diarrhoea in some of the Roman soldiers,” said Dr Marissa Ledger, who helped lead the study as part of her PhD with the University of Cambridge’s archaeology department.\n\n• Nine ways to avoid getting ill before Christmas\n\nThe findings are the first evidence for Giardia duodenalis in Roman Britain. The microscopic protozoan parasites cause outbreaks of diarrhoea. Whipworms grow to about 5cm long and roundworms can reach 30cm.\n\n“While the Romans were aware of intestinal worms, there was little their doctors could do to clear infection by these parasites or help those experiencing diarrhoea, meaning symptoms could persist and worsen,” Ledger said. “These chronic infections likely weakened soldiers, reducing their fitness for duty.”\n\nVindolanda, which is located between Carlisle and Corbridge in Northumberland, was constructed by the Romans in the early 2nd century AD to defend their province of Britannia from attack by northern tribes.\n\nIt remained in use until the end of the 4th century and was defended by infantry, archery and cavalry units drawn from across the empire. The site has become known for preserving objects in its waterlogged soil — including more than 5,000 Roman leather shoes.\n\n• Truth of vast network of Roman roads revealed\n\nThe latest analysis by Cambridge and Oxford researchers, published in the journal Parasitology, looked at sediment from a sewer drain leading from a latrine block.\n\nFifty samples were taken along the 9m-long drain, which carried waste from a communal latrine to a stream. Researchers used microscopes to hunt for remains of the eggs of parasitic worms that infect humans and other animals.\n\nMore than a quarter of the samples contained roundworm or whipworm eggs, and one held remnants of both worm species. When researchers turned to a technique that used antibodies to bind onto the proteins produced by single-celled organisms, they then found traces of Giardia duodenalis.\n\nThe team also took a sample connected to an earlier fort, constructed around 85AD and abandoned about seven years later. The sample came from a ditch that formed part of the fort’s defensive system; it contained both roundworm and whipworm.\n\nDr Piers Mitchell of Cambridge, senior author of the study, said: “Some soldiers could have become severely ill from dehydration during summer outbreaks of Giardia, which are often linked to contaminated water and can infect dozens of people at a time. Untreated giardiasis can drag on for weeks, causing dramatic fatigue and weight loss.\n\n“The presence of the faecal-oral parasites we found suggests conditions were ripe for other intestinal pathogens such as salmonella and shigella, which could have triggered additional disease outbreaks.”\n\nThe Vindolanda findings mirror those at Roman military sites elsewhere including Carnuntum, in Austria; Valkenburg on Rhine in the Netherlands; and Bearsden in Scotland. Samples taken at urban sites such as London and York show a more diverse parasite range, including fish and meat tapeworms.\n\n• Seven of the most fascinating Roman ruins in the UK\n\nDr Patrik Flammer, who analysed samples at the University of Oxford, said: “Despite the fact that Vindolanda had communal latrines and a sewer system, this still did not protect the soldiers from infecting each other.”\n\nDr Andrew Birley, who leads excavations at Vindolanda, said they “continue to find new evidence that helps us to understand the incredible hardships faced by those posted to this northwestern frontier of the Roman Empire nearly 2,000 years ago”.",

    "title": "2026 Crypto Exchange Architecture Explained – Get Expert Insights",
    "description": "Cryptocurrency Exchange Architecture is the framework of a crypto platform, ensuring efficient trade matching, secure wallets, liquidity handling, and smooth user interaction for reliable trading",
    "fullText": "Cryptocurrency exchange architecture forms the foundation of every trading platform, determining how trades are executed, funds are secured, and users interact. In 2026, with over 200 active exchanges globally and centralized platforms like Binance handling nearly 40% of the world’s spot trading volume, having a secure, scalable, and high-performance architecture is more important than ever.\n\nAs the crypto ecosystem evolves, exchange platforms are adopting new technologies, from hybrid and decentralized models to advanced security protocols and automated liquidity management. These innovations ensure faster transactions, enhanced user experience, and regulatory compliance, positioning modern exchanges to meet the demands of both retail and institutional traders.\n\nIn this blog, we’ll explore the latest trends, core components, and architectural advancements shaping cryptocurrency exchanges today.\n\nCryptocurrency exchange architecture is the technical blueprint of an exchange, defining how the trading engine matches orders, how funds are stored, and how users interact. Leveraging scalable engines, real-time order books, and intuitive frontends, a well-designed architecture ensures fast, secure, and compliant operations, supporting both high-volume traders and everyday users in a reliable, seamless environment.\n\nWhen built well, this architecture makes the exchange fast, secure, and dependable. Conversely, poorly designed architecture can lead to downtime, security vulnerabilities, or slow, frustrating user experiences, issues that can quickly harm an exchange’s reputation in today’s competitive market.\n\nTo understand how exchanges are built, here are the primary building blocks:\n\nAny exchange revolves around the trading or matching engine. It pairs buy and sell orders according to the rules such as price-time priority. The engine also needs to be able to process millions of orders in a second with a small latency in the high-performance systems. As an example, the matching engine of Binance can handle very large throughput\n\nLiquidity is the capacity to sell or purchase assets very easily without any major alterations in prices. Trades employ various liquidity designs: centralized order books with designated market makers, on-chain liquidity books (in the case of DEXs), or hybrid. The architecture should facilitate effective access to liquidity, potentially with a combination of several sources.\n\nThe manner in which an exchange manages user money is of the essence. Other exchanges are custodial (they custody user wallets), non-custodial (the user retains control with private keys). Hybrid models may allow both. The wallet architecture also determines the nature of handling deposits, withdrawals, and cold/ hot storage in a secure way.\n\nOrder book records outstanding buys/sell orders. Exchanges can be on-chain (occasionally deployed on pure DEX), off-chain or in-memory. The structure of the order book has an impact on performance, transparency and security.\n\nIt has no compromise on security: It includes authentication (KYC, 2FA), fund security (Multi-sig, cold storage), smart contract audits (DEX), and resistance to trading risks, such as front-running, MEV, or DDoS. These security layers should be in-built in the architecture.\n\nTrade is made easy, responsive and trustworthy with the good front end. The UX should receive order placement, charting, account and wallet connections, and give real-time feedback.\n\nA robust admin panel allows operators to monitor trades, manage liquidity, configure markets, and handle risk. Modern exchanges also include crypto exchange APIs for automated tools, third-party integrations, and liquidity management, essential for scalability in turnkey deployments.\n\nIn particular, the fiat on-ramps and off-ramps (banks, payment processors) come in handy, especially when it comes to centralized exchanges. The architecture should be equipped with trustworthy and secure payment systems to exchange crypto and fiat.\n\nThere are various types of cryptocurrency exchange that have their own architecture, features, advantages, and trade-offs. Knowing such types assists the user, the developer and investors to assess performance, security and usability.\n\nCentralized exchanges operate on a traditional client-server model, where the platform manages user accounts, wallets, and order matching. Trades are executed through a central server, which allows for high-speed transactions, deep liquidity, and fiat integration. Such are Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. As convenient and quick to trade, CEXs force the user to leave their money in the hands of the platform to be hacked.\n\nDEXs run on blockchain networks and smart contracts, enabling peer-to-peer trading without a central authority. Users keep control over their money decreasing counterparty risk. Liquidity is dealt with by order books or automated market makers (AMMs). These are Uniswap and dYdX. DEXs are more transparent, secure, and decentralized, although they can be slower in their transactions and have more expensive network charges than CEXs.\n\nHybrid exchanges are built on the combination of CEXs and DEXs features to provide both speed and liquidity with the added non-custodial security. Ordinarily, the way an order matching is conducted is off-chain and then settled on-chain. This is the most optimal solution because it offers the speed of trading, lower charges and enables users to have greater control over funds. The hybrid models are becoming popular to bridge between centralized convenience and decentralized trust.\n\nP2P exchanges connect buyers and sellers directly, allowing them to trade crypto using local currencies or payment methods. The platform usually serves as an escrow service to brush off transactions and fraud. They are Paxful and LocalBitcoins. P2P exchanges offer more options in payment, privacy, and accessibility particularly where banking infrastructure is least developed but might lack liquidity compared to the CEXs.\n\nThe exchange is driven by the backend which deals with trades, liquidity and wallet security, and the front end is to be used to provide the user with a clean, user-friendly interface. The two provide a combination of fast, reliable and safe trading.\n\nCryptocurrency exchange architecture shapes how modern trading platforms operate, from order matching and liquidity flow to wallets, user dashboards, and backend systems. As centralized, decentralized, hybrid, and P2P models grow, the right architectural approach helps ensure smooth trades, consistent performance, and a better trading experience for users.\n\nWith emerging trends like AI-driven trading, Layer 2 networks, cross-chain functionality, and enhanced UX/UI, exchanges are evolving to meet the expectations of both retail and institutional traders. When platforms prioritize strong design, dependable performance, and regulatory alignment, they establish trust and remain competitive in a rapidly evolving market.\n\nIn this landscape, cryptocurrency exchange development is about building a foundation that can adapt to new technologies and industry demands. A well-structured architecture doesn’t just run a platform , it supports long-term growth and shapes the future of your exchange .just run a platform , it supports long-term growth and shapes the future of your exchange.",

    "fullText": "Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing for his annual televised Q&A session, and a new poll shows Russians remain focused on two issues: the war and the economy.\n\nAccording to a poll of 1,608 Russians conducted by the independent Levada Center, the top two concerns Russians want to raise with Putin are when the war will end and how they're supposed to cope with a deteriorating economy.\n\nAbout a fifth of respondents said they would ask Putin when the war in Ukraine, which the Kremlin calls a \"special military operation,\" would end.\n\nRight behind the war is the economy, as another 16% say their top question is about living standards — salaries, pensions, and benefits.\n\nThese two concerns have topped Levada's polls ahead of Putin's annual Q&A for three years.\n\nBeyond the top concerns, Levada found that 8% of respondents want to ask Putin about price growth and tax hikes, 6% about utilities and social services, and 5% about the healthcare system.\n\nThe anxiety comes as Russia's inflation remains high, and the country's massive defense spending jostles with social spending.\n\nPutin's televised \"Direct Line\" Q&A session, scheduled for Friday, comes nearly four years after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, triggering sweeping Western sanctions.\n\nSince the invasion in February 2022, the Kremlin has steered the country onto a wartime economic footing.\n\nHeavy defense spending and state-directed investment have helped sustain headline economic growth, even as sanctions and export restrictions have reshaped trade flows.\n\nBut strains are showing: Energy export revenues have dropped in a softer oil-price environment, while high inflation continues to sap consumer demand.\n\nPrevious hourslong \"Direct Line\" broadcasts offer a preview of how Putin may handle the questions the Kremlin allows.\n\nLast year, Putin acknowledged that Russia's economy was overheating amid high inflation and warned citizens to brace for continued pressure.\n\nHowever, he deflected blame, suggesting that both the central bank and the Russian federal government — formally headed by the prime minister — could have acted more decisively to prevent the surge in prices and credit growth.\n\nPutin is also expected to hold an end-of-year news conference on Friday, where the spotlight will be on any signals he offers about the direction of the war.",

    "title": "New H-1B visa rules upgrade some lottery applicants — and squeeze out others",
    "description": "New H-1B visa rules favor Big Tech's big salaries, limiting opportunities for startups and entry-level applicants in the job market.",
    "fullText": "The H-1B visa has always created winners and losers. Every spring, the government runs a lottery for 110,000 new visas. Last fiscal year, nearly half a million people put their names in.\n\nThis fall, the Trump administration set new rules in motion that immigration lawyers say will upgrade some foreign nationals in the lottery, while others will get squeezed out.\n\nTrump's overhaul of the H-1B visa program slaps a $100,000 fee on new petitions for workers living abroad, and includes a proposal that would tilt the lottery in favor of the highest-paid applicants. Instead of giving every applicant a single, equal shot, the lottery would give workers in the top wage bracket four chances. Those in the lowest tier would continue to get just one.\n\nSuddenly, a machine-learning researcher promised a pro-athlete-sized paycheck looks like a slam dunk in the lottery compared to a junior developer at a midsize company.\n\nThe written comment period on the wage rule ended in late October, and the Department of Homeland Security is now reviewing comments and preparing the text of the final rule.\n\nThe Trump administration holds that employers have abused the H-1B as a way to hire IT talent cheaply. A September executive order announcing the new fee framed the issue as a raw deal for American workers, saying the program had been \"deliberately exploited\" to replace them with lower-paid foreign labor. The fee is now facing multiple legal challenges in federal courts.\n\nIn a statement, Matthew J. Tragesser, a spokesman for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, told Business Insider that the agency is working closely with the Department of Labor and the State Department to reform the H-1B program to \"root out fraud.\"\n\n\"The proposed rule will protect American workers, encourage employers to offer competitive wages, and ensure that H-1B visas go to top-tier talent filling critical, high-skill positions as the law intended,\" Tragesser said.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Department is tightening its screening of H-1B workers and their H-4 family members. The department directed consular officers to review applicants' social media and other public online activity as a standard part of the process — a shift that has led some consulates to cancel or reschedule visa appointments as they adjust to the new vetting rules.\n\nA State Department spokesperson framed the expanded screening as part of a broader push toward rigorous vetting over fast processing. The department said it may move appointments as resources change, with applicants able to request expedited slots on a case-by-case basis.\n\nImmigration lawyers say the proposed lottery updates hand an edge to large tech companies.\n\nThe fee won't apply to most hires in Big Tech's pipeline, said Jason Finkelman, an Austin, Texas, attorney focused on employment and family immigration. It's much more common for those companies to poach visa holders already in the United States, or hire new grads straight out of American schools, whereas the fee only affects new petitions for workers living abroad.\n\nA National Foundation for American Policy analysis of government data found that in fiscal year 2025, Amazon led all employers with 4,644 approved new H-1B petitions, followed by Meta, Microsoft, and Google. It was the first time these four tech giants occupied the top four spots.\n\nLarge enterprises will treat the $100,000 H-1B fee as the price of getting the right people inside their organizations, said Edward Raleigh, a partner at Fragomen, one of the largest global immigration law firms.\n\nJustin Parsons, a partner at law firm BAL, which focuses on work immigration, is telling his tech clients that the fee could actually work in their favor. They can absorb a fee that startups and IT staffing firms cannot. In a lottery, when high-volume filers pull back, everyone else's odds improve, including those of cash-rich tech companies still submitting names. Plus, if the wage rule goes into effect, it would give Big Tech's big-ticket hires a better chance of success.\n\nThe wage-based system would shift the odds even further toward large, often publicly traded companies that can afford to slot foreign hires into the top salary bands. Immigration lawyers say that would leave equity-heavy but cash-poor startups at a disadvantage in the lottery.\n\n\"Often the best startup founders forgo being paid a living wage because they're so dedicated to the mission,\" said Bay Area immigration lawyer Sophie Alcorn. Those same startups \"may be the ones that have the most difficulty in getting the right people through this future system.\"\n\nOne exception, said Alcorn, is the crop of well-funded artificial intelligence startups, where base pay for elite machine-learning researchers and engineers is already sky-high.\n\nUnder the new system, international students would also have fewer shots on goal.\n\nNew grads typically start in lower-wage tiers, which would give them fewer tickets in the lottery, just as small and midsize companies are backing away from sponsoring them at all.\n\nAlcorn, who serves mostly entrepreneurs and early-stage tech companies, said a handful of jobseekers, including international students, have told her that companies have pulled offers to those requiring visa sponsorship — spooked by headlines and shifting rules.\n\nOn paper, most foreign students who are already in the United States shouldn't be hit with the $100,000 fee, Finkelman said. If they're on F-1 student visas and move onto H-1Bs, that's a change of status, not a brand-new petition, so the fee wouldn't apply, he said.\n\nThe Trump administration has framed these updates as a win for American workers. Software engineers, in particular, have something to gain if the changes achieve their stated intent.\n\nThe tech industry has shed tens of thousands of staff this year, with Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta all cutting engineering-heavy roles as they restructure around automation. At the same time, early-stage startups are boasting that machines now do a huge share of the coding.\n\nImmigration lawyers are suggesting that some companies will pull back from hiring foreign talent under these new rules. The Trump administration is banking on some of those jobs now defaulting to American-born workers and green-card holders by the process of least resistance.\n\nDomestic coders are contending with both layoffs and LLMs. But in this new hierarchy of risk, the American engineer could become a safer, cheaper bet than a foreign hire whose visa now comes with more cost, paperwork, and regulatory headaches.\n\n\"One of the main attributes of this administration is that it keeps people guessing,\" said Ted Chiappari, head of the immigration group at law firm Duane Morris. \"Just because things are one way on Monday doesn't mean they're going to be the same way on Tuesday, and they won't switch back on Wednesday.\"",

I wasn't sure what it'd be like. I didn't think one person could affect the team the way he's done.\n\n\"From minute one, I think the standards really rose because he does everything to 100%.\n\n\"It's kind of like, well if he's got that amazing career and he's still doing everything perfectly, why wouldn't we? And I think it just sort of lifted the standards.\"\n\nSunderland have won seven and lost just four of their 16 league games, and Ballard attributed Xhaka's influence to that winning mentality.\n\n\"I mean literally everything, from the work in the gym to the standards, he puts out on the training pitch,\" added the centre-back, 26.\n\n\"You know we've just been outside, it can be cold and wet and but he's 100% focused and giving everything in training.\n\n\"So when some of us boys may be not putting that work in and you see him doing it, it's unacceptable for us.\n\n\"If he's doing it, he's won titles and played hundreds of games in the Premier League.

    "fullText": "Third Ashes Test, Adelaide Oval (day three of five)\n\nAustralia 371: Carey 106, Archer 5-53 & 271-4: Head 142*, Carey 52*\n\nEngland 286: Stokes 83, Archer 51; Boland 3-45\n\nEngland were pushed towards the precipice of the fastest Ashes series defeat in more than 100 years as a Travis Head century maintained Australia's grip on the third Test in Adelaide.\n\nHead was dropped on 99 by Harry Brook and spent eight balls one run short of a hundred before belting Joe Root down the ground for four to draw a deafening roar from his home-town crowd at the Adelaide Oval.\n\nThe left-hander moved Australia's second innings to 271-4 and their overall lead to 356 at the end of the third day.\n\nIf England's third loss in as many Tests is completed on Saturday, it would mean the Ashes have been decided in 10 days of cricket.\n\nNot since 1921, when Australia needed only eight days of play to win in England, has the destination of the urn been settled so swiftly.\n\nHead's inevitable ton snuffed out brief England hope that was raised when captain Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer added 73 runs in the morning session.\n\nStokes made 83 and Archer 51 in a stand of 106, the highest by an England ninth-wicket pair in Australia since 1924.\n\nAt 53-2 and 149-4, England clung on before being cut adrift by Head. At some point, England will be tasked with pulling off the highest successful chase on this ground in order to keep the Ashes alive.\n\nOf further concern to the visitors is the fitness of all-rounder Stokes, who is yet to bowl in the 66 overs of Australia's second innings.\n\nRealistically, England's fate in this match and the series was sealed by their batting on the second day.\n\nIt needed a trademark Stokes miracle to keep his team from their destiny and, despite how well the captain and Archer have personally performed in this match, Stokes might have exhausted his escape acts.\n\nThere will be questions over all-rounder Stokes' physical state for the rest of the series. Never one to avoid work when his team need him, there were times when he was bent double in the field.\n\nBar the 90 minutes of resistance England mustered in the morning session, this day went as expected – Australia batting under minimal pressure, grinding England into the dirt.\n\nEngland's effort cannot be faulted, they are simply being outclassed. They are suffering a slow death in the City of Churches, a prolonged post-mortem of the Bazball project.\n\nA team aim will be to extend the match to Sunday, to at least avoid a historically swift series defeat. Individuals like Zak Crawley, Ollie Pope and Jamie Smith need runs to alleviate growing pressure on their international futures.\n\nHead's elevation to open the batting on the second day of the first Test will go down as one of the defining moments of the series. His match-winning century in Perth gave Australia a momentum they have never looked like relinquishing.\n\nThis ton was memorable for different reasons. Like Alex Carey on day one, Head is another South Australian enjoying an Ashes moment on home turf. This was his fourth successive century in Tests at the Adelaide Oval.\n\nHe had to endure a lively England burst with the new ball, particularly from Brydon Carse. With the storm weathered, Stokes absent from the attack and Will Jacks unable to hold an end, Head cashed in.\n\nEngland tried different plans, at one point packing the off side with seven fielders, but Head still found ways to score. He added 84 for the fourth wicket with Usman Khawaja, who made 40 to further his case to be retained for the fourth Test.\n\nThe chance to Brook, off the bowling off Archer, was a powerful slash to gully. It would have been a smart catch, though should have been taken. In the next over, Head lofted Root's off-spin down the ground to complete his 11th Test ton.\n\nIt was fitting that Carey was Head's partner when he reached three figures. Their partnership stood at 122 by the close, with Carey unbeaten on 52 and eyeing a second hundred in the match.\n\nStokes and Archer are among the few England players to have performed so far on this tour. Their tight relationship goes back to the 2019 World Cup final.\n\nWhen Stokes was captured on camera on the second morning giving Archer a tongue-lashing for his bowling, it was an example of how Stokes knows he can get the best from his paceman.\n\nFrom 213-8 overnight, and with 12 overs in the morning before the second new ball, the ninth-wicket pair were more expansive than the previous evening.\n\nStokes drove Scott Boland for four from the third ball of the day, Archer swiped Nathan Lyon over long-on for six.\n\nStokes' 50, from 159 balls, was his slowest in Test cricket and the slowest by any England batter in the Bazball era. Archer, who took five wickets in Australia's first innings, made his maiden half-century in Tests and the second-highest score by an England number 10 in Australia.\n\nStokes deserved a hundred only for Mitchell Starc to hit the stumps through the gate. Stokes roared in frustration, while Archer chased the captain all the way to the boundary to pat him on the back.\n\nCaptain Stokes 'knackered' but 'fit to bowl'\n\nHead grinds England down on third day - as it happened\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "When Anthony Joshua made his professional debut against Emmanuel Leo in 2013, fresh from Olympic gold in London, the boxing world treated it like the start of a coronation.\n\nAt roughly the same time, a 16-year-old prankster from Ohio named Jake Paul was posting six-second Vine videos - chatting to pineapples in supermarkets and climbing into strangers' shopping trolleys for a laugh.\n\nMore than a decade later, through wildly different routes, the pair have arrived at the same place.\n\nThis Friday, in Miami, they will share a ring in a professional heavyweight contest that still feels faintly unreal.\n\n\"I'm not worried about what people think about the integrity side, I'm more worried about are they talking?\" Joshua says.\n\n\"That's the whole point of this fight. It creates conversation.\"\n\nPaul says he has no fear and will \"shock the world\" to become the \"king of boxing\".\n\nThey will fight eight three-minute rounds at the Kaseya Center, in standard 10oz gloves, under professional rules. Joshua wasn't allowed to weigh more than 17st 7lb (111kg).\n\nOtherwise, there are no concessions.\n\nBBC Sport explores how this unlikely fight came together, what both men have to gain and lose and why many within the sport are uneasy about the risk it represents.",

    "fullText": "Rising darts star Beau Greaves has been described as 'world class' by the game's top player, so how far can she go on the biggest stage?\n\nThe 21-year-old begins her PDC World Championship campaign against 22nd seed Daryl Gurney at Alexandra Palace in London on Friday evening.\n\nAnd despite losing on her only previous appearance at the tournament, she is rated odds-on favourite by bookmakers to beat Gurney, a World Cup winner with Northern Ireland, and reach the second round.\n\nGreaves hit the headlines when defeating world champion Luke Littler in October to reach the World Youth Championship final. Interest in the contest was such that visitors almost crashed the online system offering score updates.\n\nThat came amid an unbeaten run of 86 matches in the Women's Series, which has provided five competitors in an expanded 128-player world championship.\n\nLittler admitted he hoped to avoid the woman nicknamed 'Beau and Arrow' when the draw was made.\n\n\"Beau Greaves is definitely one that I wouldn't want to play,\" said Littler, who in January became the youngest world darts champion aged 17, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"She's world class, that's why she's won the Women's World Championship three times.\n\n\"She's been dominating the Women's Series for two or three years now and she's only going to get better and better.\"\n\nFive-time world champion Raymond van Barneveld has predicted a good run in the Worlds could see Greaves invited to the eight-player Premier League - although 2021 world champion Gerwyn Price described that suggestion as \"a joke\".\n\nOnly one woman has won matches on the world stage at the Ally Pally - Fallon Sherrock twice in December 2019 - while Greaves' debut three years ago ended in a first-round defeat by William O'Connor.",

    "description": "\"Our officers are dedicated.\"",
    "fullText": "A major international criminal vape shipment recently went up in smoke, due to the efforts of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials located near Chicago O'Hare International Airport.\n\nThe agency announced the bust in a press release and revealed the confiscated goods were worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. An inspection of a delivery from China en route to Mississippi uncovered 43,200 unlisted components of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS).\n\nMembers of the CBP and FDA at Chicago's Central Examination Station assessed that the goods both lacked proper FDA marketing permissions and were improperly valued. The criminals involved were trying to sneak in contraband and avoid paying taxes on it.\n\nOfficials identified the ENDS pieces as Kangvape Onee Sticks and valued the shipment at a whopping $358,000. That, of course, will not be cashed in by the parties in Mississippi, as the merchandise instead heads to the CBP's Fines, Penalties, and Forfeiture office.\n\n\"Our officers are dedicated to identifying and intercepting these types of shipments which could potentially harm the health and well-being of people within our communities,\" said LaFonda D. Sutton-Burke, the office's director of field operations.\n\nSutton-Burke is on the money. The vaping industry is linked to negative health impacts, particularly among young people whom the products often target. Getting them hooked on tobacco comes with severe long-term risks.\n\nMeanwhile, vapes are a menace to the environment due to their mishmash of components. The improper disposal of single-use plastics, toxic e-waste, and lithium batteries they are composed of poses a major challenge.\n\nWhen tossed out into nature, they can leach dangerous chemicals, be a hazard to tires and machinery, and be ingested by animals. When placed in trash or recycling bins, they pose a serious fire risk at landfills or recycling facilities.\n\nThere is encouraging news in the U.S., as increased education and awareness of vaping's health risks seem to be resonating among teenagers and reducing their use. Still, experts are worried about the impact of potential funding cuts.\n\nUndoubtedly, keeping illegal products off the streets, as the CBP did here, is another way to combat vaping.\n\nDo you think the U.S. should tax goods from China?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nAfter the latest seizure, the CBP remained steadfast in its mission to catch other would-be offenders.\n\n\"We will continue to work with our consumer product safety partners to identify and seize unsafe and illicit goods,\" Sutton-Burke concluded.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "A cardiac expert has warned he is “seriously concerned” about President Donald Trump’s health after watching his “manic” address to the nation.\n\nDr. Jonathan Reiner, a medical analyst for CNN who served as the late Vice President Dick Cheney’s cardiologist for over 30 years, posted a series of alarmed statements on X as Trump delivered his accelerated address.\n\nTrump sped through the 18-minute address, often taking an angry tone, and occasionally shouting the words he was reading off a teleprompter.\n\n“The pace of this address is manic,” Reiner wrote, noting that the tone of the speech also did not match the Christmas decorations displayed behind Trump.\n\nThe president squeezed in a brief festive greeting at the end, without cracking a smile.\n\n“I’m seriously concerned about the health of the president,” Reiner said of the 79-year-old, adding that, “No one should be happy to see the president like this. He looks unwell.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.\n\nTrump’s health has been an ongoing concern this year, from his bruised hand to nodding off in Cabinet meetings.\n\nEarlier this month, Reiner fact-checked White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt when she announced that Trump’s second health check in a year included a “preventative MRI” to examine his heart and abdomen.\n\n“Well, there really is no preventative cardiac MRI,” Reiner said.\n\n“This is not a standard test for an 80-year-old man to undergo advanced imaging,” Reiner continued, saying the White House’s messaging had a “weird and defensive, evasive tone” to it.\n\nHe also pointed out that “preventative” abdominal imaging was especially peculiar.\n\n“This obviously was performed in response to some clinical concern, which is fine. Things happen to people as we all get older, and the president is almost 80,” said Reiner, who is a professor of medicine at George Washington University in D.C. “So, instead of this kind of evasive, almost laughable kind of note, just spell out what happened.\n\n“I hope the imaging is normal and great; that would be excellent news,” Reiner added. “But this kind of piece-by-piece, drip-by-drip release of information is just concerning.”\n\nThe breakneck pace and loud volume of Trump’s speech was also discussed on CNN’s NewsNight on Wednesday.\n\nOne theory is that CBS factored in a maximum 22-minute presidential interruption for Trump’s speech as part of the three-hour Survivor finale, which is always a ratings hit.\n\n“He was loud, he was forceful, he was fast,” author and journalist Terry Moran said of Trump.\n\n“The networks only gave him 15 minutes, supposedly. And that is a problem for him because he likes to ramble, he likes to improvise, and he sounded like a man shouting at the nation that entire time.”\n\nMoran said while Trump listed off “great things” he had done for the economy, “the facts of people’s own lives will refute you.”\n\n“I thought that was a huge mistake,” Moran said. “People think this economy is very bad for them personally and he’s shouting at them.”\n\nCNN political analyst and co-host on The View Ana Navarro said the speech was “18 minutes of their lives” people would never get back.\n\n“It was an angry old man shouting from the hills, shouting at the kids to get off their lawn,” Navarro said.\n\nShe said, “He interrupted the finale of Survivor, which has 4.5 million viewers. There’s a lot of Survivor fans for this old man to come and scream about how everything is great.”",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump suspended the green card lottery program on Thursday that allowed the suspect in the Brown University and MIT shootings to come to the United States.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a post on the social platform X that, at Trump’s direction, she is ordering the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to pause the program.\n\n“This heinous individual should never have been allowed in our country,” she said of the suspect, Portuguese national Claudio Neves Valente.\n\nNeves Valente, 48, is suspected in the shootings at Brown University that killed two students and wounded nine others, and the killing of an MIT professor. He was found dead Thursday evening from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, officials said.\n\nNeves Valente had studied at Brown on a student visa beginning in 2000, according to an affidavit from a Providence police detective. In 2017, he was issued a diversity immigrant visa and months later obtained legal permanent residence status, according to the affidavit. It was not immediately clear where he was between taking a leave of absence from the school in 2001 and getting the visa in 2017.\n\nThe diversity visa program makes up to 50,000 green cards available each year by lottery to people from countries that are little represented in the U.S., many of them in Africa. The lottery was created by Congress, and the move is almost certain to invite legal challenges.\n\nNearly 20 million people applied for the 2025 visa lottery, with more than 131,000 selected when including spouses with the winners. After winning, they must undergo vetting to win admission to the United States. Portuguese citizens won only 38 slots.\n\nLottery winners are invited to apply for a green card. They are interviewed at consulates and subject to the same requirements and vetting as other green-card applicants.\n\nTrump has long opposed the diversity visa lottery. Noem’s announcement is the latest example of using tragedy to advance immigration policy goals. After an Afghan man was identified as the gunman in a fatal attack on National Guard members in November, Trump’s administration imposed sweeping rules against immigration from Afghanistan and other counties.\n\nWhile pursuing mass deportation, Trump has sought to limit or eliminate avenues to legal immigration. He has not been deterred if they are enshrined in law, like the diversity visa lottery, or the Constitution, as with a right to citizenship for anyone born on U.S. soil. The Supreme Court recently agreed to hear his challenge to birthright citizenship.",

    "fullText": "Charlie Munger didn't believe in shortcuts — but he did believe in thresholds. And if you ever asked how to get rich, he had a number ready: $100,000. Hit that, he said, and you'll have the momentum to keep going. Fail to hit it, and you'll spin your wheels forever.\n\nMunger, who died in 2023 just weeks shy of his 100th birthday, was best known as Warren Buffett's blunt, brilliant right hand — but he built a billion-dollar fortune of his own by focusing on what worked and ignoring what didn't.\n\nOne piece of wisdom that resonates with investors is his take on building wealth. In the late 1990s, during a shareholder meeting, Munger said, “The first $100,000 is a b****, but you gotta do it.”\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nThis statement emphasizes the initial hurdle many face in accumulating savings. Munger’s bluntness highlights the challenge of reaching that critical first $100,000.\n\n“I don’t care what you have to do,\" he said. \"If it means walking everywhere and not eating anything that wasn’t purchased with a coupon, find a way to get your hands on $100,000.\"\n\nThe reason behind Munger’s focus on this initial amount? The power of compounding. Once you have that base, the path to greater wealth becomes smoother. With compounding returns, $100,000 can grow significantly over time, providing a strong foundation for long-term financial goals.\n\n“After that, you can ease off the gas a little bit,” he said.\n\nTrending: $100k+ in investable assets? Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes – no cost, no obligation.\n\nMunger made this statement in the mid-1990s, and when adjusted for inflation, $100,000 at the time is roughly equivalent to about $200,000 in 2025 dollars, based on U.S. consumer price index data. The number itself has shifted with time, but the idea behind it has not. The first meaningful pool of capital is still the hardest to assemble, and everything that follows depends on clearing that initial hurdle.\n\nThat belief stayed with Munger until the end of his life. In 2023, during one of his final long-form interviews discussed on the \"Acquired\" podcast, he summed up the payoff of that early grind in a single line: \"You only have to get rich once.\" The remark reflected a theme he returned to repeatedly over decades — build a durable financial base one time, and the rest of your decisions become less constrained.",

    "fullText": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee's governor pardoned country star Jelly Roll on Thursday for his criminal past in the state, acknowledging the Nashville native's long road back from drugs and prison through soul-searching, songwriting and advocacy for second chances.\n\nThe rapper-turned-singer whose legal name is Jason Deford has spoken for years about his redemption arc before diverse audiences, from people serving time in correctional centers to concert crowds and even in testimony before Congress.\n\nRepublican Gov. Bill Lee issued the pardon after friends and civic leaders of the Grammy-nominated musician joined in an outpouring of support.\n\nJelly Roll's convictions include robbery and drug felonies. He has said a pardon would make it easier for him to travel internationally for concert tours and to perform Christian missionary work without filling out burdensome paperwork.\n\nHe was one of 33 people to receive pardons Thursday from Lee, who for years has issued clemency decisions around the Christmas season. Lee said Jelly Roll’s application underwent the same monthslong thorough review as other applicants. The state parole board gave a nonbinding, unanimous recommendation for Jelly Roll's pardon in April.\n\n“His story is remarkable, and it’s a redemptive, powerful story, which is what you look for and what you hope for,” Lee told reporters.\n\nJelly Roll and Lee meet at the governor's mansion\n\nLee said he never met Jelly Roll until Thursday, when the musician visited the governor's mansion over the pardon news. The two hugged in front of a lit Christmas tree and a fireplace decorated with holiday garlands.\n\nUnlike recent high-profile federal pardons, which let people off the hook for prison, a Tennessee pardon serves as a statement of forgiveness for someone who has already completed a prison sentence. Pardons offer a path to restoring certain civil rights such as the right to vote, although there are some legal limitations, and the governor can specify the terms.\n\nJelly Roll broke into country music with the 2023 album “Whitsitt Chapel” and crossover songs like “Need a Favor.” He has won multiple CMT Awards, a CMA Award and also picked up seven career Grammy nominations.\n\nMuch of his music deals with overcoming adversity, like the song “Winning Streak” about someone’s first day sober. Or the direct-and-to-the-point, “I Am Not Okay.”\n\n\"When I first started doing this, I was just telling my story of my broken self,” he told The Associated Press in an interview. “By the time I got through it, I realized that my story was the story of many. So now I’m not telling my story anymore. I’m getting to pull it right from the crevices of the people whose story’s never been told.”\n\nJelly Roll: '‘I was a part of the problem’\n\nBefore the parole board, Jelly Roll said he first fell in love with songwriting while in custody, calling music a therapeutic passion project that “would end up changing my life in ways that I never dreamed imaginable.”\n\nOutside of sold-out shows, he's testified before the U.S. Senate about the dangers of fentanyl, describing his drug-dealing younger self as “the uneducated man in the kitchen playing chemist with drugs I knew absolutely nothing about.”\n\n“I was a part of the problem,” he told lawmakers at the time. “I am here now standing as a man that wants to be a part of the solution.”\n\nJelly Roll's most serious convictions include a robbery at 17 and drug charges at 23. In the first case, a female acquaintance helped Jelly Roll and two armed accomplices steal $350 from people in a home in 2002. Because the victims knew the female acquaintance, she and Jelly Roll were quickly arrested. Jelly Roll was unarmed, and was sentenced to one year in prison plus probation.\n\nIn another run-in 2008, police found marijuana and crack cocaine in his car, leading to eight years of court-ordered supervision.\n\nSheriff whose jail held Jelly Roll urged a pardon\n\nFriends and civic leaders cited his transformation in backing a pardon.\n\nDavidson County Sheriff Daron Hall, who runs Nashville’s jail, wrote that Jelly Roll had an awakening in one of the jails he managed. Live Nation Entertainment CEO and President Michael Rapino cited Jelly Roll's donations from his performances to charities for at-risk youth.\n\n“I think he has a chance and is in the process of rehabilitating a generation, and that’s not just words,” Hall said in a phone interview Thursday. \"I’m talking about what I see we need in our country, is people who accept responsibility, accept the fact that they make mistakes and accept the fact that they need help.\"\n\nThe parole board began considering Jelly Roll’s pardon application in October 2024, which marks the state's five-year timeline for eligibility after his sentence expired. Prominent Nashville attorney David Raybin represented Jelly Roll in the pardon case.\n\nLee's office said no one was pardoned Thursday who had a homicide or a sex-related conviction, or for any crime committed as an adult against a minor.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI is the latest to make a political hire as big tech spreads its tentacles around the world. So what’s the attraction?\n\nGeorge Osborne getting a new job isn’t exactly news. Since leaving frontline politics, the former chancellor has served as the chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, edited (not entirely successfully) the Evening Standard, advised asset manager BlackRock, joined boutique advisory firm Robey Warshaw, been appointed as the chair of the British Museum and taken on roles including advising crypto firm Coinbase. Oh, and like any white man of a particular age, he co-hosts a political podcast.\n\nBut Osborne’s latest job is the most eye-opening – and is an alarming augur of what is to come. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, has become the latest organisation to employ Osborne. He will run OpenAI for Countries, a unit tasked with working directly with governments while expanding the company’s Stargate datacentre programme beyond the US. At least it was announced with a tweet, rather than a LinkedIn post.\n\nThe tweet prompted jokes, as did Osborne’s single-handed attempt to boost laggard employment figures brought about by his policies as the chancellor of austerity. But it’s a serious moment, because it’s another sign that the biggest AI firms are starting to behave less like normal companies and more like quasi-governments. They’re negotiating “national” partnerships, pitching a values-led vision of “democratic AI” and hiring former senior politicians as their diplomatic corps. It’s a similar path we have seen from other industries, including oil, pharma and defence, in previous decades – which is why it’s important to try to recognise the risks and head them off before AI companies can repeat the same trick.\n\nThe initiative Osborne is heading up, OpenAI for Countries, does what it says on the tin. It’s designed to embed OpenAI’s models and infrastructure inside the machinery of states, becoming an invaluable, indefatigable part of the running of our lives. OpenAI is in talks with about 50 countries to provide them with critical national infrastructure. Whether you welcome Osborne being put in that role rather than a tech executive is a little like Hobson’s choice: who do you distrust the least? But it’s an indication of how tech companies see their position in society that they are hiring such high-powered people for these roles.\n\nOsborne is not the first to don the branded hoodie and Silicon Valley lifestyle. His fellow coalition government bod Nick Clegg blazed the trail as head of global affairs for Meta. At the time of his initial hiring as a vice-president at Facebook in 2018, his appointment was treated as a PR move – a big name to help the company navigate scandal and scrutiny. But it hinted that platforms had become political actors, whether they liked it or not. The industry’s outsized spending on lobbyists (€151m in Europe alone at the last count) to support the political beasts is an indication of what is at stake. The numbers involved also hint at the scale of the prize that tech companies see: the 10 largest big tech firms now outspend the biggest 10 companies in the pharma, finance and automotive industries combined.\n\nThe former chancellor isn’t even the first former controller of the UK public purse to be handy to big tech. In October of this year, Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Microsoft and the AI firm Anthropic, less than two years after he convened the AI safety summit at Bletchley Park. Sunak, at least, already had the regulation hoodie in his wardrobe.\n\nYou can read these moves in two ways. The generous interpretation is that these companies are hedging: trying to anticipate tech regulation and ensure they understand it. The more cynical interpretation is that they are attempting to shape the geopolitical story around AI from inside the machine, hiring former leaders less for their technical insight than their institutional muscle memory and networks.\n\nEither way, it leaves democracies with a problem. Governments are supposed to set the rules of the road. But the tech companies they are meant to regulate are on a different scale, planting their feet in different countries. When Sunak convened the Bletchley Park summit, it was notable that he turned interviewer to quiz Elon Musk, sitting starry-eyed on stage as Musk dominated the discourse.\n\nIt’s time to recognise these companies are acting like political actors. That means it’s time to treat them like political actors, too. We need more transparency: governments signing up to OpenAI for Countries agreements should publish the details of their partnerships by default. We should also ask more questions about infrastructure dependence. Governments love Stargate-style investments in their countries, and want to be able to don a hard hat, cut a ribbon and issue a press release. But if they are in effect a new layer of national backbone, they should be studied more closely – as if they are utilities, rather than receive the good grace of a startup-style mystique.\n\nThe more tech companies start to act like politicians and global leaders, the more we need to treat them like it. That doesn’t mean deference; it means more scepticism and journalistic interrogation.\n\nChris Stokel-Walker is the author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World’s Favourite App",

    "fullText": "Minister says ‘any individual’ at low risk from hack, while Sun reports Chinese cyber gang responsible for breach\n\nThe UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office was hacked in October, the minister Chris Bryant has said.\n\nBryant, a trade minister in Keir Starmer’s government, told Sky News there was a low risk to “any individual” from the cyber-attack.\n\nDetails of the hack emerged on Friday in a report by the Sun that claimed a Chinese hacker group was behind the cyber-attack.\n\nHowever, Bryant told broadcasters it was “not clear” who perpetrated the attack and cautioned against speculation. “There certainly has been a hack at the FCDO and we’ve been aware of that since October,” Bryant told Sky News.\n\n“And just as you will have been reporting earlier on this year on the cyber hack at JLR [Jaguar Land Rover] and at Marks & Spencer, and earlier last year, I think it was at the British Library, all of these are really important things for us to tackle and be aware of and prevent wherever possible.\n\n“Some of the reporting has, I think, been a bit more speculation than accurate.”\n\nBryant said: “Quite often the investigation takes quite a long time to get down to that. We managed to close the hole, as it were, very quickly. There was a technical issue in one of our sites, I gather, and we’re fairly confident that there’s a low risk of any individual actually being affected by this.\n\n“I know that some of the reports have said potentially various things could happen. I think that’s a bit more speculation than is helpful. So I don’t want to scaremonger about this. We are on top of it. And also, it’s not entirely clear where this has come from. I know everybody’s speculating about that as well. It’s that that is not entirely clear either.”\n\nAsked if China was behind the attack, Bryant said: “That’s not entirely clear.”\n\nThe Sun named Storm 1849 as the Chinese cyber gang responsible for the breach, which it said was understood to possibly include tens of thousands of visa details.\n\n The group has been “accused of targeting politicians and groups critical of the Chinese government”, the newspaper said.\n\nA government spokesperson told the Guardian: “We have been working to investigate a cyber incident. We take the security of our systems and data extremely seriously.”",

    "fullText": "Deal will allow app to continue operating in US as Elizabeth Warren condemns Trump and his ‘billionaire buddies’\n\nTikTok has signed a deal to sell its US business to three American investors – Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX – ensuring the popular social video platform can continue operating in the United States.\n\nThe deal is expected to close on 22 January, according to an internal memo seen by he Associated Press and Reuters. The TikTok chief executive officer, Shou Zi Chew, said in the memo that ByteDance and TikTok have signed binding agreements with the three investors.\n\nThe new TikTok US joint venture will be 50% held by a consortium of new investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX with 15% each. Another 30.1% will be held by affiliates of existing ByteDance investors and 19.9% will be retained by ByteDance, according to the memo.\n\nWhite House officials have said Oracle, which was co-founded by Donald Trump’s supporter Larry Ellison, will license a copy of TikTok’s recommendation algorithm as part of the deal, in a partnership that will expand on Oracle’s existing management of TikTok’s trove of data collected about its US users.\n\nEllison’s role in the new ownership of the most popular social media platform in the US has raised concerns about the decreasing share of media firms not under the control of pro-Trump billionaires, with Ellison’s son David now driving wholesale changes at CBS, Elon Musk in control of X, formerly known as Twitter, Mark Zuckerberg overseeing both Instagram and Facebook, and Jeff Bezos owning the Washington Post.\n\n“First Paramount/CBS and now TikTok,” Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, wrote on Bluesky in response to the news. “Trump wants to hand over even more control of what you watch to his billionaire buddies. Americans deserve to know if the president struck another backdoor deal for this billionaire takeover of TikTok.”\n\nRush Doshi, who coordinated US government policy on China and Taiwan as a Biden National Security Council official, noted that there were “still some questions about who controls the algorithm. They say it will be trained on US data. Great, but has the algorithm been transferred, licensed, or is it still owned and controlled by Beijing – with Oracle merely providing ‘monitoring?’”\n\nThe agreement comes after a long delay. Trump said in September that he had spoken with China’s president over the phone about the deal and he had “a very good talk with president Xi” and “he gave us the go ahead”.\n\nIn October, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, announced that the US and China had “reached a final deal on TikTok”.\n\nIn 2020, during his first presidency, Trump had threatened to ban TikTok in retaliation for China’s handling of Covid.\n\nCongress later passed a ban of the app over security concerns that was signed into law in April 2024 by Joe Biden. The ban was set to go into effect on 20 January 2025 but implementation was pushed back multiple times by Trump while his administration worked to develop a deal to transfer ownership.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "When AIs become consistently more capable than humans, life could change in strange ways. It could happen in the next few years, or a little longer. If and when it comes, our domestic routines – trips to the doctor, farming, work and justice systems – could all look very different. Here we take a look at how the era of artificial general intelligence might feel\n“Does it hurt when I do this?”\n Continue reading...",
    "fullText": "A Eye: “NOOOO! The problem is a sprain in the brachial plexus due to you lifting that 10kg carton on Wednesday at 2.58pm and not eating enough blah blah”\n\nIn 2035, AIs are more than co-pilots in medicine, they have become the frontline for much primary care. Gone is the early morning scramble to get through to a harassed GP receptionist for help. Patients now contact their doctor’s AI to explain their ailments. It quickly cross-checks the information against the patient’s medical history and provides a pre-diagnosis, putting the human GP in a position to decide what to do next.\n\nIn face-to-face consultations an AI may listen in the background, weigh the facts of the patient’s case against thousands of medical studies, propose a course of drugs based on the full depth of the latest medical research, which the human doctor could never fully digest. It provides a second opinion for the doctor, who can assess its proposals before deciding how to act.\n\nThe public may not be wholly averse to this change. Thirty-eight per cent of people favour using AI to speed up triage in the NHS although 52% prefer humans, citing trust and wanting personal interaction, polling by Ipsos in October 2025 found.\n\nMedical screening becomes highly sophisticated and perhaps a little invasive. Doctors could be sent details of your diet and vital statistics tracked by wearable devices. Smart toilets may even analyse your bowel movements. Medicines could be produced exactly tailored to your body and its needs.\n\nIf it all works, diseases are spotted quicker and medicines are more accurately prescribed, but the combination of one AI and one human medic creates a new tension. The best doctors become those most adept at interpreting the outputs of the AIs. Medical schools change their teachings to focus more on managing AI medics, and politicians wrestle with how to overhaul medical regulation and ethics.\n\nThe rivals racing to create super-intelligence. This was put together in\n collaboration with the Editorial Design team. Read more from the series.\n\nJustice is increasingly enabled by AI, although some fear it is taking over. Solicitors preparing for trial have learned to delegate the legwork of unearthing case law and planning arguments to an AI, which proposes the best approach for a barrister to take in court. The current problems of AIs making up case law, as happened at least 95 times in July and August, according to trackers, have been ironed out. The new, more robust artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems compress days of work into hours, leaving the human solicitor only to check the AI’s brief to the human barrister.\n\nNext, amid a courts backlog, pressure grows to largely replace barristers too. An experiment is launched allowing adversarial AIs to argue cases in front of a human judge and jury. The results prove compelling. Cases are concluded at a fraction of the cost to the taxpayer and much faster. But numerous miscarriages of justice soon emerge. Campaigners for people wrongly imprisoned begin to demand greater transparency about the inner workings and biases of the AI lawyers.\n\nHaving unleashed AGI, governments and companies have to constantly surveil the autonomous systems, employing people to sit at banks of screens, shutting down dangerous behaviour, dispatching good AIs to hunt down bad AIs.\n\nWAIT! … Were there any eggs in the fridge?!\n\nHe’s asleep now, I can’t ask him.\n\nHe’s clumsy when he hasn’t eaten his breakfast eggs.\n\nWhat if he drops me? Replaces me?! There’s a new set of glasses out tomorrow!!!\n\nWearable AI devices, such as glasses, watches and rings, have become ubiquitous. They function as extra senses, spotting things in our environment that we miss, like a lack of eggs in the fridge, or recording our interactions to remind us later of things we forget. But then they also start to do things for us – and maybe even worry about not doing a good enough job.\n\n“First principle is, you have a bunch of these AI agents that do things for you,” says David Shrier, professor of practice, AI and innovation at Imperial Business School. “These will be specially programmed AIs that have different areas of expertise and are customised – adapted to you and your specific needs. So they learn … what you want and they go and do it for you.”\n\nYou might start your day with the help of an information agent. “It goes out, it curates the articles and when you wake up in the morning and as you are brushing your teeth, it’s reading out to you summaries and interpretation of the news. It can provide some deeper understanding for you.”\n\nThis second-guessing based on deep algorithmic familiarity extends to your breakfast. If you have been wearing augmented reality glasses, the AI will have noticed when you opened the fridge that you’ve run out of eggs. When you go downstairs at 7am your phone lights up to say an Amazon drone has delivered you some eggs.\n\nShrier adds that all of this requires consent, meaning “you know what you are allowing the AI to understand and know about you, and you get to easily opt out if you don’t want your data shared.”\n\nA farmer’s rounds, checking on the health of livestock, crops, feed supplies and machinery – which can take from dawn to dusk – become far less onerous. With cameras and sensors rigged to trees, barns, fence posts and itinerant robots, every farm delivers a torrent of data to help increase productivity and animal welfare. Already, in 2025, an AI model is under development to detect early infections in cows by tracking subtle shifts in their social behaviour. A herd in Somerset is being filmed around the clock to train a model to predict if an animal is in the early stages of mastitis, which affects milk production and is an animal welfare problem. A decade later and with data harnessed from millions of farms around the world, AGI advises not only what to plant and when, but how to build stronger ecosystems, and improve soil health. AGI-powered robots could stalk the fields rooting out weeds and reducing the need for herbicides.\n\n… and this was called an office …\n\nFilled with people and chairs and phones and desks and carpet and water coolers and paper\n\nSports clubs, live entertainment venues and travel agents boom as AGI transforms work, helping millions of white-collar workers whisk through their tasks leaving time for a new life of leisure – at least that is one theory.\n\nIn the early years of AGI only a few people are made fully redundant by full automation, and most stay in work. For a while people retain the same 40-hour working week and simply get more work done.\n\nAt work, AI could act like a “buddy” or a coach in meetings, says Shrier. It might advise you to go easy on another attender because they look a little stressed.\n\n“During your meeting you’re getting this sort of coaching and augmentation that makes you better at interacting.” As the chat ends, the AI sends you a list of next steps to take following this meeting – and slots it into your project plan. As you get to your desk, your professional AI assistant is bringing you the documents and spreadsheets you need to deliver.\n\nAI-augmented economies could grow sharply. But soon people realise they can afford to work less. The 15-hour week, which the economist John Maynard Keynes in 1930 predicted would happen by 2030, becomes a reality. Leisure becomes less about rest and orientates towards creative activities, human-to-human socialising and time caring for children or elderly family members, academics have suggested.\n\n“If you believe the premise that humans are social animals, they’re going to have to do something,” the US sports and entertainment mogul Ari Emanuel said in October as he announced new investments in live entertainment. “They can’t just sit at home, so they’ll go to music, they’ll go to sports and they’ll go to my live events.”\n\nBut the shift to more spare time also creates a new problem: mass boredom. A generation conditioned for the nine to five and which had derived satisfaction from now-automated tasks such as populating spreadsheets or writing reports, struggles to adjust. Some people take to the new leisure like happy retirees and report increased wellbeing, but others struggle with mental health problems.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United got a first-hand glimpse of Antoine Semenyo on Monday, with the January window drawing ever closer.\n\nUnder the lights at Old Trafford, the Ghanaian scored the first of Bournemouth’s three equalisers on the night, with the pulsating encounter eventually ending 4-4.\n\nWith the goal, the “special” 25-year-old now has seven goals and three assists this season, and is currently the third top-scorer in the Premier League.\n\nNaturally, plenty of clubs are eyeing the Cherries talisman, and the list includes the likes of United, Manchester City, Liverpool, and Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nBoth the Red Devils and their noisy neighbours had called Bournemouth to understand the viability of a January deal.\n\nGiven City’s current position in the league table, and the guarantee of playing Champions League football, the Ghana international could have opted to switch to the Etihad.\n\nHowever, as per The Daily Telegraph, there are murmurs that Pep Guardiola might step down, come the end of the season. And that strengthens United’s chances of landing the versatile attacker.\n\n“Manchester United will go all-out to sign Antoine Semenyo in January and hope the uncertainty over Pep Guardiola’s future could strengthen their hand.\n\n“United are locked in a four way tussle with Manchester City, Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool for the coveted Bournemouth forward, whose £65m release clause activates from the start of next month.\n\n“Semenyo, 25, is in huge demand and has a big decision to make as he plots his next career move.\n\n“City want Semenyo but United are among the suitors out to take advantage of the doubts about whether Guardiola will still be at the Etihad Stadium beyond the end of this season.”\n\nAs for Liverpool, they can only advance once the Mohamed Salah situation becomes clearer.\n\nThus, United are in an advantageous position if they plan to launch an assault early in the winter window. Antoine Semenyo has a release clause of £65 million.\n\nWith Bryan Mbeumo, and Amad set to be unavailable due to AFCON, United have a readymade replacement. Now, whether INEOS can afford to pounce will be interesting to see.\n\nFeature image Lewis Storey via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

SAUBERT. @SEAHAWKS WIN! pic.twitter.com/VF2QElidFV\n\nThis year is the first season in which regular season overtime does not automatically end on an opening drive offensive touchdown. The only difference between regular season and playoff overtime (which eliminated “offensive touchdown on first possession wins the game” starting in the 2022 season) is that regular season OT is still just 10 minutes and not 15. Barring a defensive or special teams touchdown (or a safety), both offenses must possess the ball at least once.\n\nThe catalyst for this change was the famous Kansas City Chiefs vs. Buffalo Bills AFC Divisional playoff classic in the 201 season, in which Josh Allen never touched the ball in overtime and the Chiefs scored a touchdown on the first possession and never looked back.\n\nWhile we’ve yet to see an opening drive overtime touchdown under the current rules in the playoffs, this is the first time that a team has conceded an overtime touchdown and come back to win the game. The Jacksonville Jaguars scored a touchdown against the Las Vegas Raiders earlier this season, only for the Raiders to respond with their own. Geno Smith’s winning pass to Tyler Lockett was batted down and Jacksonville won.\n\nIt’s only fitting that such a weird thing would first be done by the Seahawks. We expect nothing less.",

    "fullText": "At the start of this Women’s Champions League campaign, Chelsea did not look like a side ready to challenge for their first European title.\n\nA disappointing 1-1 draw with Twente on matchday one highlighted the weaknesses that threatened to prevent Sonia Bompastor’s side finally adding the Champions League to their trophy cabinet. They wasted chance after chance, were exposed by a simple direct attack, and lacked the composure needed to come from behind and secure three points.\n\nThat opening performance could have set a worrying tone for their European campaign. Instead, Chelsea have recovered to finish third in the inaugural league phase and qualify automatically for the quarter-finals, scoring 20 goals in six games and remaining unbeaten. Only eight-time winners OL Lyonnes and three-time champions Barcelona have also avoided defeat.\n\nChelsea’s grip on the Women’s Super League (WSL) title is loosening, with Manchester City six points clear at the top — but a blip in their domestic dominance would almost certainly be forgiven by the fans if they secured the one trophy missing from their cabinet.\n\nThe Champions League’s changed format has provided valuable clues about their credentials. The benefit of the league phase is that Chelsea have had the opportunity to learn their lessons early. In the past, the gap between Europe’s elite sides and the rest has often meant a relatively straightforward group phase.\n\nLast season, Chelsea won all six of their games against Twente, Celtic, and Real Madrid. By the equivalent point this season, they have already faced Barcelona — who have knocked them out in the semi-finals three years in a row — and two-time winners Wolfsburg, who have reached at least the semi-final in three of the past six seasons.\n\nChelsea’s problem in Europe in recent years has not been the quality of their squad, but their ability to outmuscle or outsmart fellow heavyweights in the knockout stages. Early evidence suggests they are overcoming that.\n\nThey drew 1-1 with Barcelona at Stamford Bridge, a massive improvement on their humiliating 8-2 semi-final aggregate defeat in April. That came down largely to a more mature tactical approach: Bompastor set her team up to immobilise Barcelona’s midfield and prevent them playing through the central corridor. Chelsea were not at their most eye-catching attacking best, but their discipline paid off as they became the only team to take points from Barcelona in the league phase.\n\nAgainst Wolfsburg, their maturity showed again. Chelsea do not often have to come from behind, but Alexandra Popp’s header after 16 minutes gave Wolfsburg a deserved lead and forced Chelsea to respond.\n\nChelsea had been physically stronger, better competitors in duels, and posed a more direct threat on the counter-attack. This was where Chelsea’s depth paid off: Bompastor was able to tweak the set-up to add more defensive nous in the midfield through Sjoeke Nusken replacing Lauren James at half-time, and refreshed the right flank by bringing on Johanna Rytting Kaneryd for Ellie Carpenter 10 minutes later.\n\nBoth changes proved astute, particularly when Rytting Kaneryd provided the assist for Sam Kerr’s winning goal that secured the 2-1 win. In the second half, Chelsea were much better at stopping turnovers high up the pitch becoming Wolfsburg counter-attacks. Lucy Bronze reaching a Wolfsburg clearance before Lineth Beerensteyn turned what would have been a threatening counter into the move that produced Kerr’s winner.\n\nIt is crucial that Chelsea stop the wastefulness that has cost them in the WSL from creeping into their European campaign. That sounds a harsh thing to say about a side who scored the joint-most goals in the league phase, and whose underlying numbers show they were worthy of those goals.\n\nHowever, as goals will inevitably become harder to score in the knockout stages, being clinical will be even more important. Roma, for example, gave away several goals cheaply by either not closing down Chelsea’s attackers or by leaving them unmarked in dangerous positions.\n\nArsenal, Wolfsburg, Juventus, or OL Lyonnes — all of whom could pop up on Chelsea’s potential path to the final — will not yield chances so easily. That was on show against Barcelona, where Bompastor admitted her frustration at the chances Chelsea missed to take all three points.\n\nTheir display against Wolfsburg was much more promising. Kerr, Erin Cuthbert, and James all missed in front of goal, but Chelsea had nine of their 16 shots on target — a significant improvement on their domestic form — and will need to maintain such numbers to progress to the final.\n\nThere are lessons from this league stage, too. Loose passes in midfield handed Wolfsburg many of their early opportunities, culminating in Livia Peng’s poor ball out from the back from which Popp got the better of Keira Walsh and scored the opener.\n\nThe other question is whether Bompastor would take a more controlled, patient approach in knockout games. It paid off against Barcelona, but that was in a league-phase game where the risks and rewards were lower for both teams.\n\nIn the closing stage of a knockout match, would Bompastor want her side to be so patient? This team’s identity is all about attack and using their expensively assembled, Hydra-like forward line to cut through opponents. How long would they be able to resist the temptation to take the handbrake off?\n\nThursday’s knockout draw has revealed their path to the final: a quarter-final against either Arsenal or OH Leuven, followed by a semi-final where they could face Wolfsburg, Juventus, or Lyon. Barcelona are on the other side of the bracket, so if Chelsea are to face them again, it would be in the final.\n\nChelsea have time to mull this over.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nChelsea, Champions League, Women's Soccer\n\n2025 The Athletic Media Company",

Paul, who is coming off his highly-publicized exhibition with Mike Tyson last year, has primarily faced former MMA stars. He is hoping to leverage his speed, power, and high ring IQ to overcome the massive size and experience disparity against Joshua, looking to shock the world in one of the biggest events in combat sports history.\n\nThe fight has captured global attention and is expected to bring in a record-breaking viewing audience for Netflix, as Paul believes he will deliver an emphatic upset and end Joshua's championship aspirations.\n\nMORE: Is Floyd Mayweather fighting Mike Tyson?\n\nAlycia Baumgardner (c) vs. Leila Beaudoin\n\nIBF, WBO, and WBA Super Featherweight Titles\n\nAnderson Silva vs. Tyron Woodley\n\nCruiserweight (195 lbs.

    "fullText": "The Maccabi Tel Aviv big man does it all. From scoring, dunking, blocking, and rebounding, the Minsk, Belarus-born Sorkin has continued to carve out a rise to the top.\n\nIt’s clear that Roman Sorkin has become the next Israeli Euroleague superstar.\n\nThe Maccabi Tel Aviv big man does it all. From scoring, dunking, blocking, and rebounding, the Minsk, Belarus-born Sorkin has continued to carve out a rise to the top.\n\nThe 29-year-old has developed into a bona fide superstar who can play at the highest level, drawing interest from NBA clubs, as the one-time Oregon Duck center who barely saw the floor in college has become one of the local greats.\n\nIn Maccabi Tel Aviv’s first Euroleague game back in Israel since the start of the October 7, 2023 war, Sorkin proved to be unstoppable in scoring 26 points to match Yotam Halperin’s record for a Sabra in the continent’s top competition.\n\nSorkin, who played for Maccabi Haifa beginning in the 2017/18 season after finishing his time at Oregon, moved to the yellow-and-blue for the 2021/22 campaign and has slowly but surely turned into a dominant force and one that head coach Oded Katash has not rushed along prematurely.\n\nIn his debut Euroleague campaign, Sorkin averaged only 8.3 minutes per game, but then doubled that output in the following two seasons. This year, he’s putting in 22 minutes per game and scoring 14 points in those contests while loving every second of it.\n\nDespite his age, Katash believes that Sorkin is still developing and has even better days ahead.\n\n“Usually, when talking about a player Roman’s age, even though he’s not old of course, you’re talking about a player who is foundational and I still think Roman has potential. I’ve coached many players throughout my career. I wouldn’t say the same things about all players at this stage of their careers. His ability to be more consistent and demand more of himself and continue to develop, that’s something he does. I’m very proud of him. As you know, I really admire him and it’s a great privilege for me to believe in him. I hope and wish that he will break many more records.”\n\nSorkin’s teammates revere him and only have the finest things to say about the center, including Tamir Blatt, who has been at Sorkin’s side for many years since their days with Israel’s youth national teams, as the guard was in awe of Sorkin’s points record.\n\n“That’s something else,” Blatt said. “I mean, he’s unique, you know. I’ve known Roman since we were 16 and to see the way he elevates his game every year and the level he’s playing is unbelievable. I’m just happy he’s my teammate.”\n\nOne of Sorkin’s front-court teammates, Marcio Santos, also spoke about what he sees the Israeli can bring to the table.\n\n“He brings experience and he knows how to play. He’s been playing in this league for years and he has been able to really help me by giving me tips, how to do this and how to do that. We’re learning how to play together as is the entire team. I think it’s a great thing for him to match the record. Everybody knows Roman is a great player, he’s a great guy off the court and of course on the court, he works hard and all of that is going to pay off.”\n\nWhen Sorkin found out that he had matched Halperin’s mark, he actually didn’t want to even believe it and credited his teammates.\n\n“Doron Jamchi has that, it’s a 40, no? Oh in the Euroleague, wow, I didn’t know, it’s a great honor, it’s an honor to be with Yotam, he’s an amazing player. Thank you to everyone on the team for everything they’ve done for me, thank you, I don’t play one on one, so thank you all here and I hope I can break this record as well.”\n\nThe game, which marked the first time Maccabi played in the Euroleague at its real home in Tel Aviv since October 5, 2023, when it beat Partizan, was an emotional one that Sorkin will not forget.\n\n“It’s amazing; we’re so happy to be back home, playing with our fans here back home is incredible. We’re really excited being home, playing in front of our crowd. We want to say thank you to everybody who let this happen once again and thank you to Belgrade for hosting us for so long, it’s something unbelievable.\n\n\"We just want to keep playing home. It’s so much fun to play at home and it’s so tough to beat us at home. Something about this arena, Yad Eliyahu, is that you’re just stepping into the energy and you can just feel it. I missed it and now it’s just going to get better and better.”\n\nBlatt also shared his thoughts about having the games return to Israel.\n\n“It was amazing. I mean, after two and a half years, going through so much, you know, as a team, also the country and now to be able to play with our fans, which, you know, they’re like our sixth man. We really needed it and the energy was amazing. It was just a big thrill. I really enjoyed it and I’m looking forward to many more.”\n\nKatash, too, shared his thoughts on the return of the Euroleague games to Israel and how emotional a moment it was to finally experience it again.\n\n“This wasn’t about basketball, it was above and beyond the game. It was really special for us. We were so emotional. I’m sure that each one of the players, staff, coaching staff and everyone around the club, it was really special for all of us. To experience that crazy and great atmosphere, playing in front of our fans finally a Euroleague game. That’s the most important thing and that’s why I feel like it’s really special.”\n\nSee more Israeli sports coverage at www.sportsrabbi.com/en",

    "fullText": "The Minnesota Twins made a quiet but smart move on Wednesday, agreeing to a minor league contract with right-handed pitcher Dan Altavilla, according to Francys Romero.\n\nThe 33-year-old reliever is expected to receive a non-roster invite to major league spring training, where he will compete for a spot in the Twins' bullpen.\n\ntwins add reliever dan altavilla to the mix \n\naltavilla added a changeup last year and saw some success with it (.172 baa 36% whiff) \n\nif he could add a little more glove side movement out of that slider he’s got a solid arsenal to work with pic.twitter.com/iGmYVtxuCw\n\n— parker hageman (@HagemanParker) December 18, 2025\n\nAltavilla comes to Minnesota after spending the 2025 season with the Chicago White Sox, where he posted a solid 2.48 ERA across 29 innings in 28 relief appearances.\n\nThe veteran right-hander also recorded two saves and showed he can still get outs at the big league level after missing most of the previous three seasons due to Tommy John surgery and other injuries.\n\nThe Twins finished the 2025 season with a 70-92 record, placing fourth in the AL Central and missing the playoffs.\n\nA big reason for their struggles was the bullpen, which was gutted at the trade deadline when the team dealt away several key relievers including Jhoan Duran and Griffin Jax.\n\nExcited for this opportunity with the @Twins 🔥 pic.twitter.com/61MHWn8jqE\n\n— Dan Altavilla (@DanAlt3225) December 18, 2025\n\nHeading into the offseason, Minnesota's relief corps was thin and in need of depth.\n\nJustin Topa, Cole Sands, and Kody Funderburk appear to be the only pitchers locked into opening day bullpen roles, which leaves plenty of room for a veteran like Altavilla to earn a spot.\n\nThe Twins were also linked to right-hander Brad Keller before he signed with the Philadelphia Phillies, so adding Altavilla helps fill that gap.\n\nAltavilla's best weapon is his fastball, which still sits in the 96-97 MPH range and can overpower hitters when he locates it well.\n\nHe also throws a sinker that generated ground balls at a strong 51.3 percent clip in 2025, along with a slider and a changeup he developed last season with Chicago.\n\nThe Sox may well see plenty of former pitcher Dan Altavilla next year, as the veteran reliever has just signed a minor league contract with the Twins.\n\nHe had a 2.48 ERA in 29 appearances during his one year with the Sox this season. pic.twitter.com/IFmuL1zZtM\n\n— SleeperWhiteSox (@SleeperWhiteSox) December 18, 2025\n\nThe concerns with Altavilla are in his command and strikeout numbers.\n\nHis 17.5% strikeout rate and 12.5 percent walk rate in 2025 were both worse than the league average, and his 5.45 FIP suggests some regression could be coming.\n\nBut for a minor league deal with no guaranteed money, the risk is low and the upside is real if the Twins can help him refine his control.\n\nDan Altavilla, Filthy Sinkers. 😷 pic.twitter.com/9WwyBX526v\n\n— Rob Friedman (@PitchingNinja) September 10, 2025\n\nThe Pennsylvania native has spent parts of eight seasons in the big leagues with four different teams, including Seattle, San Diego, Kansas City, and Chicago.\n\nHe knows what it takes to pitch in the majors, and his experience could be valuable for a young Twins team looking to rebuild.\n\nFor Minnesota, Altavilla represents exactly the kind of low-cost addition they need to make this offseason. If he earns a roster spot, he could provide solid middle relief innings.\n\nIf not, the Twins lose nothing. Either way, it is a smart gamble for a team looking to get back on track in 2026.",

After the Rams scored a touchdown on the opening series of the overtime period, Sam Darnold and the Seahawks' offense put together a masterful game-winning drive, capped off by a Jaxon Smith-Nijigba touchdown and an Eric Saubert two-point conversion from Darnold to seal the deal.\n\nSpeaking of Smith-Nijigba, the superstar wide receiver turned in another productive outing versus the Rams, tallying eight receptions for 96 yards and the aforementioned touchdown.\n\nAlong with being a part of one of the greatest comebacks in Seahawks history, Smith-Nijigba etched himself in the franchise history books on Thursday.\n\nAfter an eight-catch performance, Smith-Nijigba broke the franchise record for most catches in a single season. The Ohio State product is now up to 104 receptions on the year, surpassing the previous record of 100, set by himself in 2024 and Tyler Lockett in 2020.\n\nSmith-Nijigba has had an Offensive Player of the Year-caliber season in 2025 and has established himself as one of the best players in the sport. The 23-year-old is top five in receptions, yards, and touchdowns among pass-catchers this year and leads the league in receiving yards with 1,627, which is also a Seahawks record.\n\nWith two games remaining in the season, Smith-Nijigba has the opportunity to solidify his case as the Offensive Player of the Year and a lock for a first-team All-Pro nod as well.

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Rams have authored quite the script thus far in 2025, but it remains to be seen how their story ends.\n\nSean McVay's bunch entered Week 16 in possession of the NFC's top seed in the playoff race, a coveted spot this time of year. With just three games to go, there wasn't a lot standing in the way of Matthew Stafford, Puka Nacua and Co.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks had something to say before the dust settled, however.\n\nSeattle's win in the two teams' Week 16 \"Thursday Night Football\" battle pushed the fate of the NFC playoff picture a bit further north, to northern California and the Pacific Northwest, as the Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers are now in control of their own destinies. The Rams are no longer able to clinch the No. 1 seed in the NFC just by winning out.\n\nMcVay's team won't have to worry about missing the postseason with the loss because it already clinched a spot in the dance. Now, it's about seeing which table Los Angeles will be seated at.\n\nHere's a look at the Rams' playoff odds, remaining schedule and overall NFC playoff picture:\n\nThe Rams already clinched a playoff spot last week, meaning they will be in the postseason regardless of their loss on \"Thursday Night Football\" in Week 16.\n\nThey entered the week in possession of the NFC's top seed, but their prime-time loss against the Seahawks pushed them from the No. 1 spot to No. 5 – the conference's top wild-card spot.\n\nThe loss put L.A. a game behind Seattle with just two weeks left. A win would have put the Rams in firm control of the NFC's top spot.\n\nThe Rams will face the NFL's second-easiest schedule the remainder of the season, per Tankathon. Their matchup against the Seahawks was the last against a team with a winning record before the postseason.\n\nLos Angeles will have to deal with a pair of NFC opponents that have been eliminated from playoff contention in the final few games:\n\nWeek 17: at Atlanta Falcons (Monday)\n\nThe NFC West is a tight race heading into the final three games. Here's how the standings look entering Week 16:\n\nSeattle Seahawks: 12-3 (3-2 in NFC West)\n\nSan Francisco 49ers: 10-4 (4-1)\n\nSeattle Seahawks (12-3; NFC West leaders)*\n\nChicago Bears (10-4; NFC North leaders)\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles (9-5; NFC East leaders)\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers (7-7; NFC South leaders)\n\nLos Angeles Rams (11-4; wild card No. 1)*\n\nSan Francisco 49ers (10-4; wild card No. 2)\n\nGreen Bay Packers (9-4-1; wild card No. 3)\n\nIn the hunt: Detroit Lions (8-6); Carolina Panthers (7-7); Dallas Cowboys (6-7-1)\n\nEliminated: Minnesota Vikings (6-8); Atlanta Falcons (5-9); New Orleans Saints (4-10); Washington Commanders (4-10); Arizona Cardinals (3-11); New York Giants (2-12)\n\nAn asterisk (*) denotes teams that have clinched a playoff spot.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Rams playoff chances, odds to make playoffs, NFC West standings",

    "description": "Puka Nacua posted a career-high 225 yards against the Seahawks. He had some words for the officials after the game.",
    "fullText": "Puka Nacua's bizarre week ended with him mad online, after the NFL's game of the year.\n\nRoughly two minutes after the Seattle Seahawks completed their comeback win over Nacua's Los Angeles Rams to take control of the NFC West, the star wide receiver fired off a tweet complaining about the game's officiating. The post was deleted minutes later.\n\n\"Can you say i was wrong. Appreciate you stripes for your contribution. Lol\" Nacua wrote.\n\nNacua posted it immediately after a career game against the Seahawks, with 12 catches, 225 receiving yards and two touchdowns on 12 targets, continuing an All-Pro level season for the third-year player. He later spoke with reporters and described it as a heated moment for himself:\n\n“It was just a lack of awareness. Just frustration.”\n\nRams head coach Sean McVay was also unaware of the tweet when speaking with reporters, declining to directly address the tweet but defending Nacua as \"a great kid that's continuing to learn about the platform he has.\"\n\nObviously, that tweet refers to the officials and Nacua's own past comments, which were part of a week that could be charitably described as eventful for the 24-year-old. During a livestream appearance on Tuesday, Nacua laid into the refs in a way virtually guaranteed to earn him a fine from the NFL:\n\n\"The refs are the worst,\" Nacua said. \"... Some of the rules aren't ... These guys want to be ... these guys are lawyers. They want to be on TV too. You don't think he's texting his friends in the group chat like, 'Yo, you guys just saw me on \"Sunday Night Football.\" That wasn't P.I., but I called it.'\"\n\nOverall, here's how the past couple weeks have played out for Nacua:\n\nDec. 7: Nacua gets caught livestreaming from a postgame locker room and is admonished by his teammates.\n\nDec. 13-14: Nacua's brother Samson is arrested for allegedly taking the car of a Los Angeles Lakers rookie without his consent.\n\nDec. 16, part 1: Nacua tries to get two streamers into the Rams' practice facility and is admonished by \"the boss man.\" Sean McVay denied he was said boss man on Thursday.\n\nDec. 16, part 2: Nacua goes live with said streamers, makes his comments about the officials, says concussions aren't real and pledges to do an antisemitic touchdown dance.\n\nDec. 17: Nacua's touchdown dance idea gains traction and criticism.\n\nDec. 18, part 1: Nacua apologizes for the antisemitic touchdown dance.\n\nDec. 18, part 2: Nacua sets a career high in receiving yards.\n\nDec. 18, part 3: Nacua posts then deletes the tweet.\n\nIt's not what you would call an ideal run from a player who will likely be seeking a long-term and high-priced contract extension from the Rams this offseason. However, his contributions Thursday also demonstrated how much the franchise needs him on the field.",

    "description": "The Seahawks opened the path for the 49ers to earn the No. 1 seed.",
    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks looked like a team that didn’t trust its quarterback. They were running the ball in situations perceived as passing. Sam Darnold threw two costly interceptions when Seattle let him throw. They couldn’t have happened at worse times.\n\nOn the flipside, Matthew Stafford and Puka Nacua of the Los Angeles Rams connected for 12 receptions and 225 yards, while Stafford threw for 457 yards and three touchdowns en route to 37 points.\n\nDarnold threw an interception as the Seahawks’ offense was driving. Not only did it take points off the board for Seattle, but the Los Angeles Rams were opportunistic enough to not only catch it, but return it inside the five-yard line. That was the second time in as many games Darnold gifted the Rams the ball inside near the goal line.\n\nSpeaking of the goal line, Darnold’s second interception came on a disguise he didn’t see coming. It was yet another opportunity squashed. The final straw came when Seattle called a pair of screen passes and ran it on a drive after they tied the score at 30.\n\nThe Seahawks’ defense kept them in it, which is odd to say for a team that allowed 30 points. As the game headed to overtime, the one way the 49ers could beat the Colts and not move ahead of Seattle was if the game ended in a tie. That’d be because the Seahawks would still be one up on the Niners in the loss column, at 11-3-1.\n\nA Seahawks loss would mean the 49ers would have the tiebreaker over the Seahawks with a Week 15 win over the Colts, as the 49ers hold the tiebreaker in the NFC West with four wins compared to Seattle’s two.\n\nWhat’s been glossed over is how gettable the Rams defense has been. Despite Darnold’s turnovers, the Seahawks found ways to move the ball. That didn’t change in overtime, and Darnold made a tremendous throw to keep Seattle alive. Then, a two-point conversion to win the game.\n\nSeattle moved to first place in the NFC West and the NFC. If they win out, they will be the No. 1 seed in the NFL.\n\nThe 49ers also control their own destiny. If San Francisco wins their next three games, they are the No. 1 seed. Thursday night went about as well as you could have hoped results-wise for the 49ers. Both teams showed cracks on both sides of the ball, and how they could potentially be vulnerable down the stretch. Best of all, the Seahawks won, opening the door to win the top seed and earn a coveted bye.\n\nAny other loss by the 49ers would require the Rams to lose again if they want to be the No. 1 seed.\n\nThe biggest deal about the Rams losing isn’t just the 49ers’ odds jumping to 23 percent to get the No. 1 seed; it’s their playoff odds shooting up to 99 percent. There’s a way for the 49ers to lose all three games and still make the playoffs. The Lions winning out is one of the few ways the 49ers would miss the postseason if they lose every game.\n\nSeattle Seahawks 12-3 (clinched playoff spot)\n\nLos Angeles Rams 11-5 (clinched a playoff spot)",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nQuarterback Dylan Raiola continues to be a hot-buttoned topic around the college football community, especially given his reported decision to enter the transfer portal.\n\nTeams have started to emerge as possible new spots for Raiola, but according to ESPN's Greg McElroy, one of them seems like an easy choice.\n\n\"If Dante Moore does decide to go to the NFL, well then, the Oregon Ducks offer a place that could be a perfect landing spot,\" McElroy said on \"Always College Football.\"\n\nBut it's much bigger. In the portal-heavy world of college football, everything is under a microscope according to McElroy.\n\n“The quarterback market is going to be a bit of a wild one this time of year,” McElroy said. “I think because of how high-profile some of these players are and how high-profile some of those schools are that are going to be in pursuit of some of these players, it makes sense that this could be one of the wilder quarterback carousels that we’ve seen in recent years.”\n\nGet used to the portal being used constantly to find quarterbacks, rather than high school prospects.\n\nTherefore, a program like the Ducks potentially wanting Raiola shouldn't come as a surprise.\n\n\"Scouting high school kids is great, but when it comes to the quarterback spot, you cannot win without them,” McElroy said. \"“So, it makes a lot of sense that there are a handful of teams that are now opting to go with the one-year or two-year rental transfer when compared to going with a guy that is homegrown from the get-go.\"\n\nIt's unclear where Raiola may end up, but heads may begin to roll if the Ducks end up winning the sweepstakes.",

The Rams were flagged eight times for 54 yards, including a critical second-and-10 pass interference call on LA cornerback Emmanuel Forbes in overtime.\n\nNotably, officials overturned a questionable incomplete pass into a fumble recovery and a 2-point conversion, which was the game-tying try in the fourth quarter.\n\nA penalty also negated a long return on the opening kickoff in overtime, but the drive still resulted in a Rams touchdown.\n\nFollowing the game, head coach Sean McVay said he did not speak with Nacua regarding the post, but ensured that it would get \"corrected.\"\n\nThe Seahawks now sit at 12-3 and atop the NFC West.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Puka Nacua again critiques refs following Thursday Night Football loss",

    "description": "It wasn’t pretty, but the New York Rangers came away with a 2-1 win over the St. Louis Blues on Thursday night.",
    "fullText": "It wasn’t pretty, but the New York Rangers came away with a 2-1 win over the St. Louis Blues on Thursday night.\n\nGoing into this matchup, the Rangers had lost two consecutive games while only scoring one goal in the process.\n\nMike Sullivan’s response was to call up Gabe Perreault and Brennan Othmann from the Hartford Wolf Pack of the American Hockey League, who both slotted into the lineup.\n\nDespite a strong first period where the Rangers led 10-5 in shots and dominated possession time for the most part, an offensive zone turnover led to a goal from Jonatan Berggren, putting the Blueshirts in an early 1-0 hole.\n\nThe Rangers came out aggressive in the second period, and on the power play, Will Cuylle took a shot that deflected off of Perreault’s foot for his first career NHL goal.\n\n“I kind of blacked out,” Perreault said about his goal. “Pretty lucky one, but feels good to get the first one.”\n\nAfter 40 minutes, the Rangers held a 25-15 edge in shots and felt they were outplaying the Blues.\n\n“I thought for the first two periods, we did a really good job,” Sullivan said. “I thought we were playing on top of them. We established a lot of offensive zone time.”\n\nThe Rangers’ game began to falter in the third period.\n\nSt. Louis began dictating the pace of play, creating multiple high-quality scoring chances, which put the Rangers on their heels for the majority of the final frame.\n\nIt was the heroics of Igor Shesterkin that helped the Rangers escape into overtime. Shesterkin made 11 critical saves down the stretch, and when the Blueshirts broke down defensively, their superstar goalie was there to bail them out.\n\n“It’s great,” J.T. Miller said of having Igor Shesterkin in net. “We talk about it all the time, it’s such a luxury to have. Even when it’s Quick in there, we are so lucky to have those guys, and obviously total confidence in them. It was on display again tonight.”\n\nShesterkin made 26 saves on the night, and his performance left Blues head coach Jim Montgomery nothing but impressed.\n\n\"Shesterkin's an elite goaltender in this league,” Montgomery said. “He showed that tonight.”\n\nIn overtime, Miller buried the game-winning goal to propel the Rangers to a hard-fought victory.\n\nMiller has recorded three overtime goals this season, joining Tomas Sandstrom, Adam Graves, and Marian Gaborik as the only Rangers players to accomplish this feat.\n\n“It's good for the confidence,” Miller said of his three overtime goals. “Last couple weeks, I feel like my games there. I don't think it's kind of back to the same as the beginning of the year. It's like not getting as much as I'd like, I think, on the scoresheet. But I got to believe that if you just play like that most games than not over the course of the season, good things will happen. Just try to be confident.”\n\nAdam Fox Returns To Practice For The First Time Since Suffering Injury It appears as if Adam Fox is making strides in his recovery from an upper-body injury.&nbsp;\n\nWhile this performance certainly wasn’t anything to write home about, Sullivan was pleased with the way his team played, specifically from the standpoint of playing with the right intentions in the offensive zone.\n\n“I thought our intentions as far as getting to the net front, getting inside a little bit more was better tonight,” Sullivan emphasized. “I thought we had more looks just by getting inside and trying to create off the shot. I do think the guys are listening in that regard, just trying to create more off the shot.”\n\nThe Rangers will be back in action on Saturday afternoon against the Philadelphia Flyers.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES — Another convincing win for the USC Trojans' Women's basketball squad as they made quick work of the Cal Poly Mustangs by a lopsided 86-39 final. Londynn Jones had herself a career night against the Mustangs in front of the 3,511 spectators at the Galen Center, dropping 28 points on 11-16 shooting and 4 steals.\n\nComing into Thursday night, the Trojans were coming off the trail of an ugly loss at home last Saturday to the best team in the country, the UConn Huskies, and with a great week of practice following the loss, according to USC Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb, she was encouraged by how the Women of Troy would respond to Cal Poly.\n\n\"I just wanted to use my time to be as clear with film and messaging as I could to lead us in the right direction,\" Gottlieb said on how she utilized the days off after the UConn loss to hone in on the mistakes that were easily noticeable during film sessions, even prefacing to her team and staff that the UConn film session would not be a \"pretty\" session.\n\nDespite the poor film session, Gottlieb expressed her enthusiasm for the encouraging aspects the film provided, as the team quickly identified their mistakes and was able to work on them easily in preparation for their Thursday matchup.\n\n\"While we got it handed to us, we also saw things that we could've done better immediately, saw things we could improve at, and what we wanted to see was a team that was more intentional defensively,\" Gottlieb said on the upside of their latest film session.\n\nThe Women of Troy must have received the memo, as they came out of the gates hot in the first half, and they went on two individual scoring runs that separated them from the Mustangs. An early 12-0 run in the middle of the first quarter and a 7-0 run heading into the locker room for halftime had the Trojans up 45-23.\n\nJones was torching it up offensively, leading the team with 18 first-half points on 7-9 shooting, including 3-5 from beyond the arc. Jazzy Davidson led right behind her with 7 points, but was being more frugal on the offensive side and was more active on the defensive end, snagging 6 rebounds in 18 minutes.\n\nThe second half was no different and was kicked into second gear as Jones and Davidson had 10 points each, and the entire team locked up any chances for Cal Poly to start any offense. At one point in the game, the Women of Troy had themselves a 50-point lead in the final minutes of the 4th quarter and had a 19-0 run in the second half as well.\n\n\"I'm just happy that we're starting to figure out how to put the pieces together, and it's been something that we've been emphasizing during practice,\" Jones said after USC's win and reflection on her 28-point night.\n\nWith this win, the Women of Troy improve to 8-3 on the season and have one more game up north against the California Golden Bears before taking eight days off to play Nebraska on December 29.",

    "fullText": "The Athletic journalist David Ornstein has named the candidate who “is going to be a Chelsea manager” amidst Enzo Maresca doubts.\n\nThis week has seen a whole lot of drama bubble up at Stamford Bridge surrounding head coach Maresca.\n\nThere was some breaking news yesterday, actually from Ornstein as well, suggesting that Manchester City were eyeing Maresca as a top candidate to replace Pep Guardiola, who looks like he could depart the club in the summer.\n\nMaresca actually did his best Pep Guardiola impression after Chelsea’s win over Cardiff in midweek, claiming he was “very happy” while looking anything but. It was as unsettling as you could imagine…\n\nThings are certainly not right there, and we can all clearly see that there is a lot of tension between the Chelsea manager and the board room right now.\n\nHow will it end? Well, personally I can only see Maresca leaving Chelsea in the summer, or being sacked. Likely some sort of mutual agreement will happen.\n\nLiam Rosenior managing Strasbourg. (Photo by George Wood/Getty Images)\n\nOrnstein, speaking on The Athletic Podcast yesterday with words from it cited on X, said:\n\n“There are many people who already saying Liam Rosenior at Strasbourg is going to be a Chelsea manager in the future, whether it’s in the immediate or medium or longer term. And that shows their contingency plans, like all well organized top clubs will be in place in one way, shape or form.”\n\nYou read stories and situations and this is just one of them that feels like it will happen, like it is inevitable.\n\nRosenior to replace Maresca at Chelsea this summer? I’d certainly not be putting any money against that happening.",

    "description": "Arkansas State completes mission of winning season and unlocks a new achievement in Frisco, TX.",
    "fullText": "Arkansas State unlocked a significant achievement Thursday night in Frisco, TX.\n\nThe Red Wolves emerged victorious in the inaugural Xbox Bowl, taking down first-year FBS program Missouri State 34-28 in the first college football game played at the Ford Center inside The Star — the practice facility of the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nImmediately after Master Chief from Halo handled the coin toss, Arkansas State wasted no time in completing a successful mission, pouncing on its competition to manufacture a lead as great as 31-7. Missouri State stared down the red ring of death but didn’t disconnect its controller. The Bears’ instead fought to the finish but failed to recover a late onside kick, watching a successful inaugural season conclude in heartbreaking fashion.\n\nArkansas State relied on the arm of veteran quarterback Jaylen Raynor, whose passing attributes looked maxed out at 99 overall for much of Thursday night. The junior finished 17-of-31 with 288 yards, delivering three touchdowns to three different targets. On the Red Wolves’ opening series, he delivered a strike to a 7-yard touchdown Jaylen Bonelli. He continued his rampage with a 71-yard sideline deep shot to sixth-year senior receiver Corey Rucker — a longtime Arkansas State standout playing his final collegiate game. Then to manufacture a 24-7 halftime lead, the quarterback played pitch and catch with Chauncy Cobb, who caught a 4-yard touchdown set up by one of Raynor’s several successful deep balls.\n\nRucker, who exceeded 100 yards in Arkansas State’s 2024 bowl victory, concluded his college career on a spectacular note. He posted 166 yards and a touchdown on six catches, exceeding 160 for the fifth time in Red Wolves colors. Rucker already held designation as the program’s career leader in receiving yards, but on his lone touchdown, he moved into sole possession of first place on Arkansas State’s all-time receiving touchdowns list, breaking a tie with Omar Bayless.\n\nMissouri State’s seventh-year quarterback Jacob Clark also saw a noble sendoff despite a losing effort, firing for 349 yards and four touchdowns against the Sun Belt opponent. However, the quarterback — who had been sacked more than any other QB in the FBS this year — was upended in the backfield all game long by an Arkansas State defense which generated nine sacks. Missouri State’s offensive line looked like it accidentally set the difficulty to Heisman mode, as Arkansas State defensive linemen Ethan Hassler, Demarcus Hendricks, and Cody Silger all frequented the hit stick to register multiple sacks in a pure domination.\n\nWith that immense pressure, Missouri State’s offense severely lagged, punting on seven of its first eight possessions. Because its lone touchdown over that 8-drive span was a 39-yard completion to Dash Luke, the Bears never snapped the ball inside the Arkansas State 35-yard line until roughly one minute remained in the third quarter. With Luke thriving in the second half behind a 7-reception, 169-yard, 2-touchdown performance, Missouri State’s offense surged late, but the Bears were in too deep of a hole with too time to fully climb out.\n\nMissouri State (7-6, 5-3 CUSA) still finished its first FBS season above .500 — a remarkable accomplishment for the program. Now that the Bears checked off their first box of playing in a bowl game, in 2026 they’ll look to move one step further by managing a bowl victory. Leading the charge will be SMU offensive coordinator Casey Woods, who is slated to accept the Missouri State head coaching position later in the week, as the team transitions to year two.\n\nArkansas State (7-6, 5-3 Sun Belt) wins its second-straight bowl game under head coach Butch Jones. The Red Wolves never won a single bowl until 2012, but now six bowl trophies will reside in their facilities when they return to Jonesboro. With the win, Arkansas State clinched back-to-back winning campaigns for the first time since its fruitful 2011-19 stretch, concluding the 2025 season with a new achievement in the inaugural Xbox Bowl.",

    "description": "Keira Barry has made a huge impact at Sunderland since joining from Manchester United. Charlotte Patterson explains why!",
    "fullText": "When Sunderland AFC Women announced the loan signing of Manchester United forward Keira Barry ahead of the 2025/2026 campaign, the move was framed as a mutually beneficial opportunity: a talented young attacker seeking consistent senior minutes and a fiercely ambitious club eager to sharpen its cutting edge in the final third.\n\nBarry arrived on Wearside with a growing reputation, a hunger for responsibility, and a résumé that already included Manchester United academy pedigree, England youth caps, and a successful loan spell at Crystal Palace during their 2024 Barclays Women’s Championship title‑winning season.\n\nWhat follows is a period that not only validated Sunderland’s faith in her but also accelerated Barry’s evolution into one of the most dynamic young forwards in the domestic game.\n\nHer early interviews revealed a player who immediately felt at home; Barry spoke openly about how quickly she connected with the environment, praising the inclusivity and ambition of the club and describing Sunderland as “one big team” with a culture that matched her own work ethic and aspirations.\n\nThat sense of belonging translated directly into her performances. From her first appearances, she played with the confidence of someone who understood both the opportunity and the responsibility placed upon her shoulders.\n\nBarry’s impact became visible not only in her goals but in the way she reshaped Sunderland’s attacking identity.\n\nHer first major headline moment arguably came in the high‑profile derby against Newcastle United Women at St James’ Park, where she scored Sunderland’s only goal in a 3–1 defeat — a strike that showcased her instinctive movement and composure under pressure. Though the result didn’t fall Sunderland’s way, Barry’s performance stood out during a difficult afternoon, reinforcing her growing importance to the side.\n\nHowever, many could argue that their first real taste of what Barry could offer was when she came off the bench against Birmingham as the entire tempo of Sunderland’s attack shifted. She immediately injected urgency and imagination, and her most audacious moment arrived when she spotted the goalkeeper off her line and attempted an outrageous lob from close to the halfway line.\n\nIt was the kind of instinctive, high‑skill effort that only a player brimming with confidence and flair even considers, let alone executes cleanly.\n\nFor a split second, the stadium held its breath as the ball arced through the air — a reminder that Barry possesses not just technical quality but the boldness to try something spectacular when others might play it safe. It was nearly a match‑winning moment and an example of her fearless mentality.\n\nWhat made Barry’s season so far so compelling wasn’t simply the goals she scored but the completeness of her attacking profile.\n\nShe arrived as a forward with raw pace, sharp instincts, and a reputation for directness, but has developed into a far more nuanced and influential presence. Her style of play blended technical precision with relentless energy, makes her a constant threat whether she was leading the line, drifting wide, or dropping between the lines to link play.\n\nBarry’s main attacking strengths are her ability to manipulate defenders with a combination of close control and explosive acceleration.\n\nHer dribbling ability has become one of Sunderland’s most reliable weapons. She has a knack for carrying the ball at speed without losing balance or awareness, often gliding past opponents with a single touch or a subtle change of direction. This isn’t showmanship for its own sake — it’s purposeful, vertical, and always aimed at destabilising defensive structures. Additionally, Barry’s dribbling is the kind that forces opponents to retreat, reshaping the pitch in Sunderland’s favour and creating space for teammates to exploit.\n\nHer pace is also a defining feature of her game.\n\nBarry possesses not only straight‑line speed but also the ability to accelerate sharply in tight spaces. This makes her particularly dangerous in transitional moments, where Sunderland’s counterattacking sequences often begin with a simple ball into her path.\n\nOnce in stride, few defenders can match her and her tenacity amplifies this threat. She chases down loose balls, presses aggressively from the front, and refuses to let defenders settle. Even when she doesn’t win possession directly, her pressure frequently forces hurried clearances or turnovers that Sunderland can capitalise on.\n\nHowever, Barry’s game isn’t built solely on physical attributes. One of the most impressive aspects of her development is her reading of the game.\n\nShe demonstrates an increasingly sophisticated understanding of timing — when to drop deep, when to spin in behind, when to hold her run, and when to attack the near post. Her movement is often a study in anticipation and she reads defensive lines with the intuition of a seasoned striker, often arriving in pockets of space a fraction of a second before her marker.\n\nThis intelligence makes her a consistent outlet for Sunderland’s midfielders and full backs, who’ve quickly learned to trust her runs.\n\nHer reading of the game also extends to her link‑up play, and her ability to combine with teammates improved markedly as the season progressed.\n\nShe’a developed a strong rapport with Sunderland’s wide players — particularly Katie Kitching in the ten — frequently exchanging quick passes to break pressure or create overloads. Her first touch, already a strength, has become even more reliable under pressure, allowing her to receive the ball in tight areas and either turn sharply or lay it off with precision. This makes her not only a finisher but also a facilitator, someone who can knit together attacking sequences and elevate the players around her.\n\nHer crossing has become one of the most distinctive and dangerous elements of her game, the kind of delivery that can tilt the rhythm of a match in Sunderland’s favour almost instantly.\n\nBarry has a natural feel for shaping the ball into areas defenders hate — teasing, dipping crosses that force centre backs to turn, hesitate, or overcommit. Whether she drives to the byline or cuts inside onto her stronger foot, she delivers with a blend of precision and imagination, often picking out runners with a level of consistency that makes her a trusted outlet in wide areas. Her ability to cross at full speed without breaking stride adds an extra layer of unpredictability, turning even half‑chances into genuine opportunities and giving Sunderland a reliable source of creativity whenever the game becomes tight.\n\nHer shot, meanwhile, carries a wickedness that sets her apart from many forwards of her age. Barry strikes the ball with a venomous combination of technique and intent, generating power that belies her frame and accuracy that punishes even the smallest defensive lapse.\n\nShe can whip a shot across goal with minimal backlift, catch keepers off-guard with early strikes, or unleash rising efforts from the edge of the box that demand spectacular saves. What’s made her shooting truly dangerous is her confidence: she never hesitates to pull the trigger when space opens, and her ability to generate both pace and swerve means that even well‑positioned goalkeepers find her efforts difficult to read.\n\nIt’s the kind of finishing that doesn’t just score goals — it changes the momentum of matches.\n\nConsistency has become one of Barry’s defining traits and even during matches where Sunderland havestruggled collectively, the level of her individual performances rarely dipped.\n\nShe brings the same intensity, intelligence, and technical quality week after week, and has established herself as one of the most dependable figures in the squad. Her work rate has never wavered and her willingness to track back, press, and contribute defensively makes her invaluable in a league where the margins are often razor‑thin.\n\nStatistically, Barry’s contributions are significant.\n\nShe’s scored in key fixtures — including a derby goal against Newcastle United Women — and her involvement in Sunderland’s attacking phases extends far beyond goals alone. Her chance creation numbers have risen steadily, reflecting her growing influence as both a scorer and provider.\n\nAlthough Sunderland’s overall results have fluctuated, Barry’s individual metrics such as progressive carries, successful dribbles, shots on target, and pressing actions consistently rank among the highest in the squad. These statistics underscore what is evident to anyone watching: she’s becoming a complete forward.\n\nHer background has provided context for this rapid progression.\n\nBarry had already experienced senior football with Manchester United, making her debut in December 2022 in a League Cup match against Sheffield United. She has also represented England at U19 level, scoring once in five appearances.\n\nHer loan spell at Crystal Palace during their 2024 title‑winning campaign gave her a taste of high‑stakes football and the demands of a promotion push, and by the time she arrived at Sunderland, she was no longer a prospect but a player ready to take on a central role.\n\nSunderland’s environment proves ideal for her next stage of growth and the club’s ambition, culture, and emphasis on hard work aligns perfectly with her mentality.\n\nBarry herself highlighted this fit, noting that Sunderland “always puts the graft in” — a quality she values deeply. This synergy between player and club created the conditions for her breakout season and as the 2025/2026 campaign continues, Barry’s influence extends beyond the pitch.\n\nHer professionalism, attitude, and commitment have made her a respected figure within the squad. Younger players look up to her despite being young herself, whilst her senior teammates appreciate her reliability and drive. She embodies the blend of talent and work ethic that Sunderland has sought to cultivate.\n\nBarry’s season so far will be remembered as a pivotal chapter in her career; a period of accelerated growth, consistent excellence, and undeniable impact.\n\nShe arrived as a talented young forward seeking opportunities and will leave in January (or hopefully not, if we can extend her loan deal) as one of the most exciting attacking players in the league. Her dribbling ability, pace, tenacity, reading of the game, and attacking instincts combined to create a player capable of changing matches on her own. Her performances have not only been consistently good but often decisive, elevating Sunderland’s attacking threat and giving the supporters a glimpse of a star in the making.\n\nIn the broader landscape of women’s football, Barry’s half-season with the club stands as a testament to the value of strategic loans, supportive environments, and the importance of giving young players meaningful responsibility.\n\nSunderland has provided a platform and Barry provided the brilliance. Together, they created a story of growth, ambition, and success that’ll be remembered long after the final whistle of the season — despite the mixed performances from the club as a whole.\n\nIf her trajectory continues on its current path, the 2025/2026 campaign will be seen not as the peak but as the beginning — a season that unlocked her potential and set the stage for an exceptional career at the highest level.\n\nI only hope we can extend her loan to the end of the season and maybe — just maybe, dear reader — we can pull off a miracle and acquire her services permanently.",

    "description": "“If we want to attract young, ambitious and talented players, this is the tradeoff we need to accept”",
    "fullText": "It’s a mark of the huge impact they’ve made and their popularity with the fans that Sunday’s Wear-Tyne derby felt a tad bittersweet as we were treated to the sight of Sunderland’s AFCON-eligible players turning in yet another exceptionally gutsy performance before they bade a temporary farewell to Wearside in order to represent their countries in Morocco.\n\nBeating Newcastle United at home in front of a packed house before jetting off in the hope of winning silverware at Africa’s biggest footballing jamboree? Not the worst note on which to temporarily sign off!\n\nOf course, when we added these lads to the ranks in the summer, we did so in the hope that we’d possibly signed some previously undiscovered or overlooked gems — but in the knowledge that we’d have to deal with plenty of international absences during the 2025/2026 season.\n\nThat was the balance we had to strike — not least to ensure we brought players to Wearside who could build on what we achieved in 2024/2025 and to give ourselves the best possible chance of being competitive in the Premier League. Running the risk of paying the dreaded “English tax”? No thanks. We widened the scope of our search for talent, tapped into new markets and came up trumps.\n\nHowever, for Reinildo, Noah Sadiki, Chemsdine Talbi, Arthur Masuaku, Bertrand Traoré and club record signing Habib Diarra — somewhat controversially called up by Senegal after a lengthy injury layoff — signing off with a victory over Newcastle could hardly have been a more fitting note.\n\nWill we miss them? Of course — even though we’ve got along just fine in the absence of midfield powerhouse Diarra — but I can’t deny the sense of pride I feel at having so many Sunderland players considered among the best their countries have to offer, and it’ll be a real boon for the club as they compete for victory at AFCON.\n\nIf we want to attract young, ambitious and talented players, this is the tradeoff we need to accept.\n\nEvery one of these lads has contributed significantly in their own way — a ringing endorsement of the standard of Sunderland’s summer recruitment and the way in which they’ve acquitted themselves since signing. They’ve evidently won the trust of Régis Le Bris through their application, ability and sheer will to win, and they’re clearly fully invested in what’s taking shape at Sunderland.\n\nOnly Masuaku hasn’t really made a huge impact, yet former Atlético Madrid left back Reinildo is making a strong case for being one of the Stadium of Light era’s shrewdest free transfers.\n\nTalbi is an immensely exciting talent; Traoré is a wily and industrious winger and Sadiki and Diarra — along with Granit Xhaka — formed what was a hugely promising midfield trio before Diarra was struck by injury, so it’s natural that we’ll be poorer for their absence and required to adapt.\n\nHowever, despite this mass exodus of talent, there’ll be no panic from Le Bris or the coaching staff.\n\nWe’ve known for some time that AFCON absences would represent one of our major challenges and we certainly won’t be heading into this period unprepared and unsure as to what to do. With the January transfer window not far off, two avenues will converge: that of phasing new recruits into the side and eventually welcoming back the lads from Morocco, which will hopefully enable us to mount a strong push during the latter half of the season.\n\nIn practical terms, this may mean that the likes of Chris Rigg, Dennis Cirkin, Romaine Mundle, Dan Neil and 2024 AFCON winner Simon Adingra — overlooked by the Cote D’Ivoire for this tournament yet a hugely talented player nonetheless — find themselves back in the fold during the coming weeks, with all kinds of speculation about potential system changes and the like.\n\nI do believe that even in the absence of the players mentioned, we have enough strength in depth to cope.\n\nIt may mean the possibility of one or two unorthodox positional changes for the players who remain — Lutsharel Geertruida is someone I’m particularly eager to see more of — as well as a change of shape for the team as a whole, but so strong is our team spirit and the collective desire to win, there’ll be no question of their willingness to slot in where needed. That’s a basic requirement and would be for any player attempting to make a push for a first team berth.\n\nThis season, we’ve seen Trai Hume and Dan Ballard striding through games for Northern Ireland. Robin Roefs is very firmly in the mix with the Netherlands, and we’ve also seen Omar Alderete dishing out his own brand of vigilante justice when Paraguay took on the United States. Now it’s time for our “Super Six” to take centre stage and with any luck, they’ll be blessed and reign down in Africa.\n\nGood luck, boys. Go well, represent your countries with pride, passion and commitment, and we’ll be ready to welcome you back once it’s over — hopefully for what’ll be a memorable second half of the 2025/2026 season!",

    "description": "Granit Xhaka is undoubtedly the signing of the season. For me, Reinildo sits comfortably in second place behind him.",
    "fullText": "With the celebrations of the derby win still keeping us warm and fulfilled as the dismal weather continues and the shortest day of the year draws near, the name of Granit Xhaka is still dominating discussions. Finally, some of the “expert” pundits have begun to recognise what we Sunderland fans have known for several months – our captain is the Premier League signing of the season.\n\nHe has set standards, demonstrated leadership, provided experience, and driven performances, all while covering more ground than any other player in the league – despite the fact that his legs are apparently gone!\n\nNaturally, the well-deserved plaudits he has received have kept the focus on the Swiss international as Sunderland have defied the expectations of a modern newly promoted Premier League side.\n\nBut the summer recruitment drive has provided a plethora of players who have all contributed massively to the results that have been achieved thus far. Robin Roefs, Nordi Mukiele, Omar Alderete, Noah Sadiki, Chemsdine Talbi, and Brian Brobbey have all played significant roles in the performances to date but, for me, there is one player who stands out as “the second-best signing of the season”.\n\nAs much as much of the fanbase are still marvelling at the fact that KLD managed to convince Granit Xhaka to join a newly promoted side, I am still astonished that Reinildo Mandava is wearing the red and white of Sunderland after more than three distinguished years wearing the red and white of Atlético Madrid under the demanding Diego Simeone.\n\nHis pedigree as a Champions League regular has been obvious, and he has brought much-needed experience to a position which had the potential to be a problem for Régis Le Bris. Dennis Cirkin clearly has the ability to make the grade at this level, as does Aji Alese, but both have injury records that are concerning.\n\nInstead, we have been treated to the sight of Reinildo demonstrating his electrifying pace, whether shutting down his side of the defence or rampaging down the wing in support of the likes of Le Fée and Talbi. Yes, he blotted his copybook with a foolish reaction to being fouled by Aston Villa’s Matty Cash, but he has come back impeccably. On Sunday, Anthony Elanga might as well have gone to the pub and played the one-armed bandit – he would have got more change out of that than he did out of Reinildo!\n\nReinildo’s partnership with Omar Alderete has secured the left-hand side of Sunderland’s defence and given the Paraguayan confidence to step forward when the opportunity arises and display his willingness to both carry the ball forward and to showcase his impressive passing technique. Reinildo provides overlaps and underlaps that create space for Chemsdine Talbi to exploit. On Sunday it was noticeable that Sadiki was pushing forward, finding more advanced positions on the left wing, carrying the ball, and getting to the byline.\n\nAnd, just as Xhaka has, the Mozambique international has bought into the infectious enthusiasm that exists in Sunderland v.2025 – he channelled his inner Muhammad Ali as he bobbed and weaved with the Sky camera on the pitch after the final whistle.\n\nNoah Sadiki will be a bigger miss during AFCON – but only because there is no obvious replacement in the squad for the energy and work-rate that he offers. There are more defensive options to cover Reinildo’s absence, but none of them will bring to the table the complete suite of left-back skills that he has.\n\nWhen I was writing this, it was a toss-up between Reinildo and Mukiele. The deciding factor for me was the influence that Reinildo has on the performances of other players – his presence and athleticism gives Alderete, Talbi, Sadiki, and Le Fée licence to forage forward and showcase their talents, secure in the knowledge that Reinildo has the pace to cover any counter-attack down that flank.\n\nGranit Xhaka is undoubtedly the signing of the season. For me, Reinildo sits comfortably in second place behind him.",

    "fullText": "It seems certain that Claudio Echeverri will return to Manchester City in January. His loan move to Bayer Leverkusen hasn’t panned out as Echeverri has only made eleven appearances for Leverkusen this season. The majority of those appearances have been as a late substitute. Such appearances have done nothing to aid the development of the young attacking midfielder. It has now been reported that Echeverri is open to terminating his loan with Bayer Leverkusen with the hope of joining Vitor Reis at Girona for the second half of this season. That was the move Echeverri should have made at the beginning of this season to aid his development.\n\nJournalist Nil Sola has reported via X that Claudio Echeverri has already said yes to having his loan spell at Bayer Leverkusen terminated in January. Furthermore, Solar reports that Girona are eager to sign Echeverri on loan for the second half of this season. It is also reported by Sola that Claudio Echeverri’s agent pushed for the young attacking midfielder to join Bayer Leverkusen over Girona last summer. Clearly, that move hasn’t panned out for Echeverri based on his lack of minutes and first-team opportunities at the Bundesliga club.\n\nLooking back, Claudio Echeverri should have joined Girona for the 25/26 season. He would have had opportunities to play in La Liga at Girona. Vitor Reis has come on in leaps and bounds this season playing regularly in La Liga. Yes, Girona has struggled this season. But Vitor Reis has risen to become one of the best young centre-backs in La Liga. If Echeverri followed a similar path to Reis, he could’ve played a prominent role for Girona. Instead, Echeverri’s agent pushed him to join Bayer Leverkusen. The idea was sound. Playing regularly in the Bundesliga and the Champions League would have benefited Echeverri. But that hasn’t occurred. Echeverri has spent the majority of his time on the bench at Leverkusen. That hasn’t aided his development at all. The first half of the 25/26 season seems to have been a waste for Echeverri.\n\nIf Echeverri does join Girona for the second half of the season the hope is that he can turn his season around. He should get first-team opportunities at Girona. It will be up to Echeverri to take them. Girona is a club that will play him and if all goes well, Echeverri could help them in their battle to avoid relegation this season. That would benefit Echeverri’s development greatly and that is exactly what Manchester City will be hoping for.\n\nUnfortunately, the first half of this season has been a harsh lesson for Claudio Echeverri. He hasn’t played for Bayer Leverkusen and his loan move to the Bundesliga side has cost him in terms of playing regularly to aid his development. A loan move to Girona could beckon and that is the move Echeverri should have made at the beginning of this season.",

    "fullText": "The Dallas Stars never trailed and found some wacky ways in a 5-3 win against the San Jose Sharks at SAP Center on Thursday.\n\nWyatt Johnston and Mikko Rantanen have found some chemistry on the top line this season. Despite not having a consistent linemate on their left, the duo sits first and third in team scoring. Put them on the power play together, and look out, other 31 teams.\n\nEntering tonight, Johnston led the NHL with 12 power-play goals. Despite not scoring them quite as rapidly as he was early on, he was still three goals ahead of No. 2 on that list, Alex DeBrincat. Rantanen ranked third behind only Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl in power-play points.\n\nWell, add another goal for Johnston and another point for Rantanen with the extra man tonight. And was it ever pretty?\n\nTee'd up beautifully 🔥 pic.twitter.com/VpYaOg2b4a\n\n— Dallas Stars (@DallasStars) December 19, 2025\n\nThe Stars power play remains near or at the top of the league, and they are scoring goals that often look like this. Knowing where each other are on the ice, making clean passes without hesitation or stickhandling, and finishing off their chances. Elite.\n\nOh, and I almost forgot to mention that Johnston had already scored in the game. And it was a 5-on-5 goal, which he has not done a lot of lately. According to our pal Craig Ludwig, Johnston needs to show he can produce consistently at even strength if he has any shot of making Team Canada at the Olympics.\n\nDoes this look like a player who can do that?\n\nWho says Wyatt can't score 5v5? pic.twitter.com/77t9PynPi5\n\n— DLLS Stars (@DLLS_Stars) December 19, 2025\n\nThe fake hip opener like he is backing down a smaller man in the paint to get the bucket… So nice. He sells former Stars defenseman John Klingberg on the roll move to his backside, quickly pushes off his right skate, and creates just enough space to wire this wrist shot over the glove. Nice.\n\nRantanen has two assists so far, primary assists, of course, and has jumped Olli Jokinen for the fifth-most points by a Finnish player in NHL history (751).\n\nOn the DLLS pregame show, we talked about how fun and adventurous Alex Nedeljkovic is with the puck. Sean Shapiro watched him a lot in Detroit and made it clear that he has elite puck skills, but will also make questionable decisions or passes every once in a while.\n\nThrough 30 minutes, Nedeljkovic had already diced up the Stars forecheck on multiple occasions, but also turned it over twice in his own end. High-event goaltending, and we are just talking about what he can do with the puck.\n\nSan Jose couldn’t create off his passes, and Dallas didn’t make him pay for his mistakes. But that changed in the final minute of the period when Nedeljkovic decided that Justin Hryckowian could really use a goal after not scoring for nearly a month.\n\nPut it on the Ritz! pic.twitter.com/wygAGplA2J\n\n— DLLS Stars (@DLLS_Stars) December 19, 2025\n\nWhile this play was funny and the Stars will happily take the two-goal lead into the third period, I really want to talk more about how much I love Hryckowian’s game.\n\nHe is just always going. He’s hard on the forecheck. He battles on the walls and in the corners. He works hard to gain positioning in front on both ends of the ice. He has skill to create when he has the puck and hockey IQ to find open space when he doesn’t. And best of all, he is an absolute pest who often gets under the skin of opponents and finds himself in the majority of post-whistle shenanigans. He makes people mad, and that is a skill in hockey. Trust me, I found a way to do it for years despite being small.\n\nHe can also fight, and has joined the ranks along with Jamie Benn, Lian Bichsel, and Mikko Rantanen for Stars skaters who will stand up for their teammates when needed.\n\nTonight, he showed a lot of that skill and grit, annoying Sharks and tallying his fourth goal of the season to wrap it all up.\n\nThe Sharks made this one interesting with Collin Graf’s third goal in two games against Dallas. I heard those ECAC kids are underrated, eh?\n\nBut when the Sharks made their third-period push, it was the Dallas penalty kill that had to once again come up big, as it has done since the first month of the season wrapped up. And they did exactly that.\n\nThe Stars PK simply does whatever it needs to do to kill a penalty. That means big saves from Jake Oettinger (or Casey DeSmith), which he does often. It means blocked shots. How about Oskar Bäck late in the final San Jose power play… Blocks it, one hand slaps it around the defender and goes off for a change.\n\nAnd sometimes, it means improvisation to keep the puck out of your net. We’ve seen diving saves, great sticks by Miro Heiskanen or Thomas Harley to keep the puck from crossing the line behind their goalie, and full-on saves from skaters when things get really wacky.\n\nBut, wacky times included, I don’t know if we’ve seen what Colin Blackwell did to get out of a tough position and kill a chunk of time late in the power play…\n\n*Colin Blackwell Heroic Moment Alert* pic.twitter.com/xLgtuI5XBN\n\n— Robert Tiffin (@RobertTiffin) December 19, 2025\n\nThis is incredible. Not only to block the shot and win a race to the puck after your stick goes flying into the neutral zone… But to stay poised enough to bend down and basically dribble the puck with his gloves… Remember, he is a great basketball player, folks.\n\nBlackwell turns his right hand over, pokes the puck to his right, then turns and chases it down before pushing it forward with his right glove again. Then, while fighting off a forechecker, he shields the puck, dives forward, and uses his left glove to slap it down the ice and get off for a change.\n\nDallas went 3-for-3 on the kill.\n\nSometimes, you just have to do what it takes. The weird Hryckowian goal, the killed power plays, and this Blackwell… Whatever it was, are good examples of that.\n\nJamie Benn added the empty-netter to put away another win for Dallas. A win, by the way, for Oettinger on his 27th birthday.\n\nIlya Lyubushkin looked very solid defensively tonight.\n\nNils Lundkvist made a few key plays, one being the backcheck and analysis of the rush late in the game on a 2-on-1.\n\nMacklin Celebrini is very good. Sometimes, he seems to be moving too fast either for his own good or for any of his teammates to keep up. He was constantly firing passes that Sharks could not handle or return. But watching him pick up pucks out of his skates and turn and burn with his head WAAAY up is a lot of fun.\n\nCasey DeSmith is expected to start Friday in Anaheim. DeSmith is riding an 11-game personal point streak (8-0-3).\n\nSharks fans doing the shark chomp and the arena playing “Jaws” music before power plays is pretty cool. Not quite as cool as the “fang fingers” in Nashville, though (100 percent sarcasm, that is so dumb.)\n\nDLLS After Dark brings out the worst (best) in all of us.

    "description": "The Seattle Seahawks just won the game of the year!",
    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks have literally never played in a normal game ever, and Thursday Night Football was no exception. What advertised as the showdown of the season more than lived up to its top billing, as the Seahawks defeated the Los Angeles Rams 38-37 in overtime! Seattle rallied from a 30-14 deficit in the fourth quarter to prevail in one of the most thrilling games in franchise history.\n\nThe Seahawks now officially control their own destiny, not just for the NFC West, but to earn the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs. Imagine, the road to the Super Bowl could very well travel through the Emerald City for the fourth time ever.\n\nAs folks often say, \"it's not how you start, but how you finish.\" Well that summed up the Seahawks' night on Thursday, as the beginning hardly looked like this was going to result in a thrilling Seattle win. The Seahawks did open the game with a five-play, 61-yard touchdown drive - their first touchdown scored in the first quarter since the Week 10 win versus the Cardinals. This drive came after Seattle's defense forced a turnover on downs against the Rams' offense. An offense that had scored 41+ points in each of the last two games, mind you.\n\nLos Angeles did not stay silent for long, as they kicked field goals on their next consecutive drive. The Rams eventually took a 13-7 lead in the second quarter, which translated into halftime. Seattle's offense was finding it nearly impossible to stay on the field, as they were getting dominated in time of possession, losing that battle 21:13 to 8:47 after two quarters.\n\nThe Seahawks did win the coin toss at the start of the game and got the ball to begin the third quarter. Seattle took full advantage of this opportunity, which saw Kenneth Walker III erupt for a 55-yard touchdown to give the Hawks a 14-13 lead. That was the end of the good vibes in the third quarter for Seattle, as the Rams took full control of the game. Los Angeles retook the lead immediately with a field goal, and intercepted Sam Darnold on the ensuing Seahawks drive. The interception brough the ball to the 1-yard line, where LA scored immediately afterwards to go up 23-14.\n\nSeattle failed to respond, punted the ball, and the Rams delivered what many considered would be the dagger. Stafford drove his team 85 yards in nine plays and found embattled receiver Puka Nacua for a touchdown to build the lead to 30-14. At this point, it felt as if history was repeating itself, especially since recent TNF games at Seattle have resulted in blowout Seahawk losses.\n\nBut a spark was found... Los Angeles got the ball thanks to Darnold's second interception of the game deep in their own territory. Seattle's defense did force a punt from the Rams early in the fourth quarter, and wide receiver Rashid Shaheed turned the game around with a 58-yard punt return touchdown. After a successful 2-point conversion, it was suddenly a one-score 30-22 game with plenty of time left.\n\nRashid Shaheed got the Seahawks back into the game pic.twitter.com/6jjvjQ9UpS\n\n— The Seahawks Wire (@TheSeahawksWire) December 19, 2025\n\nFollowing the Rams' third-consecutive punt of the fourth quarter, the Seahawks only needed two plays to find the end zone once more. Rashid Shaheed's big game continued with a 31-yard rush. On the next play, Darnold found tight end AJ Barner for a wide open 26-yard touchdown reception. Suddenly, it was a 30-28 contest.\n\nThis is where things got bizarre. The Seahawks attempted a 2-point conversion. Darnold attempted a pass to Zach Charbonnet on a screen pass, but it was deflected and the attempt failed... or so we thought! Upon further review, Darnold had actually thrown the pass backwards, as in, a lateral. This meant Darnold's \"incompletion\" was actually a fumble, which was recovered in the end zone by a Seahawk who had touched it last. Instead of a Rams lead, the game was shockingly a 30-30 tie!\n\nThe north end zone at Lumen Field has bizarre and unexplainable properties. The site of the Fail Mary, Kam Chancellor’s fumble of Megatron, and now this. #Seahawks pic.twitter.com/IQdGpyZp8R\n\n— Kole Musgrove (@KoleMusgrove23) December 19, 2025\n\nLos Angeles unfortunately woke back up, and got the ball moving. Stafford maneuvered his offense within field goal range just before the two-minute warning. A quick side bar... in the press box, I was sitting next to Mazvita Maraire of Cascadiasports.net, and he quickly mentioned \"well, with the way this game is going, they'll probably miss the field goal.\"\n\nI should have asked him for lotto numbers next, as the Rams did miss a 48-yarder wide right.\n\nSeattle failed on not one, but two attempts to march down the field for a game-winner of their own. Now, it was overtime. The Seahawks did win the coin toss again, and decided to give the Rams the ball to start. In this new overtime system, both teams will get a chance to possess the ball regardless if the first team scores a touchdown to begin. Seattle wisely chose to go on offense second, as it meant they would be armed with all the knowledge of what they would need to do.\n\nTurns out they would need a touchdown of their own, as Stafford found Nacua for a 41-yard touchdown to go up 37-30. Nacua absolutely torched the Seattle secondary, hauling in 12 receptions for 225 yards and two scores.\n\nThis was it... do or die.... the Seahawks had one shot at redemption. One shot to earn revenge, punch their ticket for the postseason, and control their own destiny.\n\nDarnold, who had been battling both the Rams and the national narrative that he cannot show up in big games, was sublime when his team needed him most... once again. Darnold completed five passes for 53 yards, including a gorgeous strike to the former Ram himself, Cooper Kupp. Part one of redemption was found as Darnold found Jaxon Smith-Njigba for the touchdown.\n\nDecision time: do the Seahawks kick a field goal and play for a tie? After all, a tie would have been enough to clinch a playoff spot. Or do they go for the win? Well, fortune favored the bold! Darnold found tight end Eric Saubert for the biggest two-point conversion play of their careers as the Seahawks completed the comeback for a 38-37 victory!\n\nThe Seahawks are now 12-3, their first 12-win season since 2020 and only the fourth 12-win season in franchise history. Seattle controls their own destiny. If they win out, they will ensure the road to Super Bowl LX will travel down the Yellow Brick Road to the Emerald City. However, it is no small task. The Seahawks will now travel to Carolina to take on a shockingly competitive Panthers team. Keep in mind, the Panthers did upset the Rams not too long ago.\n\nA special season in Seattle continues next Sunday at 10:00 am Pacific Time.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Seahawks vs Rams: Seattle engineers comeback to defeat LA in overtime",

    "fullText": "Puka Nacua deleted tweet: Rams WR criticizes refs on social media after loss to Seahawks originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nPuka Nacua's wild week came to a head on Thursday night.\n\nEarlier this week, Nacua got into hot water for appearing on Adin Ross' live stream, in which he made an antisemitic gesture and criticized the referees.\n\n\"The refs are the worst,\" Nacua said. \"These guys are lawyers. They want to be on TV, too. . . . You don’t think he’s texting his friends in the group chat like, 'Yo, you guys just saw me on \"Sunday Night Football.\" Like, 'That wasn't P.I., like, but I called it.' . . . I mean, these guys are normal human beings, too.\"\n\nThen, on Thursday night, Nacua produced a career-best night as the Los Angeles Rams blew a 16-point lead to the Seattle Seahawks. The game, though, featured a controversial call by the referees that helped the Seahwaks tie the game.\n\nAfter the game, Nacua appeared to criticize the refs once again, which will put him once again in the league's crosshairs. Here's a breakdown of what Nacua did.\n\nMORE: How Sam Darnold led 16-point comeback\n\nAfter the Rams' loss to the Seahawks on Thursday night, Nacua instantly fired off a message on social media criticizing the referees.\n\n\"Can't say I was wrong,\" he said. \"Appreciate you stripes for your contributions. Lol.\"\n\nNacua referenced his comments on Adin Ross' stream earlier this week, when he said \"the refs are the worst.\" The wide receiver immediately deleted the message, but not before it went viral.\n\nThe tweet has since been deleted. https://t.co/52fSXsE8WSpic.twitter.com/8HH7TZoio6\n\n— Sarah Barshop (@sarahbarshop) December 19, 2025\n\nMORE: Updated NFC West standings after Seahawks beat Rams in OT\n\nMcVay got to the podium for his postgame press conference after Nacua sent and deleted his tweet, but the Rams head coach wasn't aware of Nacua's actions.\n\n\"I can't answer questions about something that I'm not aware of,\" he said.\n\nOn Nacua's controversial appearance on Adin Ross' live stream, McVay had a much more thorough answer and stood by his wide receiver while also acknowledging the wrong Nacua did.\n\n\"I don't think he understood the totality of some of the things,\" \"That's a great kid that's continuing to learn about the platform that he has. I love him, we're going to continue put our arm around him and help him learn and grow, but we never want to do things that offend anybody.\"\n\nSean McVay learned about Puka Nacua’s tweet during his postgame press conference and also responded to Nacua’s livestream with Adin Ross pic.twitter.com/6c9pS4ouNI\n\n— Ahmed/The Ears/IG: BigBizTheGod 🇸🇴 (@big_business_) December 19, 2025\n\nMcVay denied knowing anything about Nacua trying to get Ross to film on the Rams' facility, but he maintained that he will try to help the wide receiver mature as a person.",

The discovery adds to the booming science of finding ways to enlist the microbes that already live in our bodies to help us improve our health.\n\nIt's been known for some time that our gut microbiome – the collection of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microscopic critters living in our intestines – can influence weight gain or loss. But narrowing down exactly which members of this microbial community do what can take some effort to tease out. That's because microbes that live inside the body don't do well outside of it, so to test them, they often have to be processed inside airtight environments, because oxygen can often kill them. This takes time.\n\nHowever, researchers at the University of Utah (U of U) say they have succeeded in whittling down about 100 bacteria suspected of fighting weight gain to just one that really does: Turicibacter.\n\nIn their study, mice that were fed a high-fat diet and were also given Turicibacter saw reduced blood sugar, lower levels of fat in the blood, and less overall weight gain compared to a control group.\n\n\"I didn’t think one microbe would have such a dramatic effect – I thought it would be a mix of three or four,\" says June Round, professor of microbiology and immunology at U of U Health, and senior author on the study. \"So when [Kendra Klag] brought me the first experiment with Turicibacter and the mice were staying really lean, I was like, 'This is so amazing.' It's pretty exciting when you see those types of results.\" Klag is the first author on the study.\n\nThe reason why the bacteria was successful in keeping fat-fed mice thin is due to a feedback loop based on fatty molecules called ceramides. These molecules increase on a high-fat diet and, as they accumulate, they not only cause the gut to increase its absorption of dietary fat, but they push the body toward higher storage of that fat. They also spike blood sugar levels, which leads to insulin resistance. This is why elevated ceramide levels have been linked to type 2 diabetes and heart disease. In some studies, in fact, they've been shown to be better predictors of cardiovascular disease than LDL cholesterol.\n\nSomewhat paradoxically, Turicibacter bacteria also produce lipids (fats) in the gut. But the molecules they produce actually tamp down the rise of ceramides, even in the face of high-fat consumption. Furthermore, when a high-fat diet is consumed, it drowns Turicibacter, eliminating its protective effects. In humans with obesity for example, Turicibacter levels in the gut have been found to be reduced.\n\nRegular supplementation in the study, however, kept the levels of Turicibacter-produced fats high and the mice slim and healthy. The researchers admit that it remains to be seen if the same results carry over to humans, but point to its potential in engineering new ways to combat weight gain.\n\n\"Identifying what lipid is having this effect is going to be one of the most important future directions, both from a scientific perspective because we want to understand how it works, and from a therapeutic standpoint,\" says Round. \"Perhaps we could use this bacterial lipid, which we know really doesn't have a lot of side effects because people have it in their guts, as a way to keep a healthy weight.\"\n\n\"With further investigation of individual microbes, we will be able to make microbes into medicine and find bacteria that are safe to create a consortium of different bugs that people with different diseases might be lacking,\" Klag adds.\n\nThe research has been published in the journal Cell Metabolism.",

    "description": "A long-standing physics mystery has been solved with the discovery of emergent photon-like behavior inside a strange quantum material. The finding confirms a true 3D quantum spin liquid and unlocks a new way to study deeply entangled matter.",
    "fullText": "A global research team led by Rice University physicist Pengcheng Dai has verified the presence of emergent photons and fractionalized spin excitations in an unusual quantum spin liquid. Reported in Nature Physics, the work points to the crystal cerium zirconium oxide (Ce2Zr2O7) as a clean three-dimensional example of this exotic state of matter.\n\nQuantum spin liquids have fascinated physicists for years because they could eventually support transformative technologies, including quantum computing and dissipationless energy transmission. Unlike ordinary magnets that settle into an orderly pattern, these materials avoid conventional magnetic order. Instead, their magnetic moments remain strongly quantum-entangled and in constant collective motion at temperatures close to absolute zero, producing behavior that resembles emergent quantum electrodynamics.\n\n\"We've answered a major open question by directly detecting these excitations,\" said Dai, the Sam and Helen Worden Professor of Physics and Astronomy. \"This confirms that Ce2Zr2O7 behaves as a true quantum spin ice, a special class of quantum spin liquids in three dimensions.\"\n\nCleaner Measurements With Polarized Neutron Scattering\n\nTo pin down these elusive signatures, the researchers relied on advanced polarized neutron scattering. This approach helped them isolate the magnetic scattering they cared about while filtering out other signals, even as the system approached the zero temperature limit.\n\nTheir measurements also revealed emergent photon signals near zero energy -- a defining trait that separates quantum spin ice from more familiar phases found in conventional magnets. Additional evidence came from specific heat measurements, which supported the idea that these predicted emergent photons follow a dispersion resembling the way sound moves through a solid.\n\nEarlier attempts to confirm this kind of behavior were often undermined by technical noise and incomplete data. The Rice-led team addressed those challenges through improved sample preparation and high-precision instruments, supported by an international effort involving major laboratories across Europe and North America.\n\nFirst-of-Its-Kind Observation With Big Implications\n\nIn this three-dimensional candidate material, the researchers observed both emergent photons and spinons -- key hallmarks of quantum spin ice. The result resolves a long-running debate in condensed matter physics and gives scientists a strong platform for studying next-generation quantum phenomena and potential technology pathways.\n\nBin Gao, a research scientist in Rice's Department of Physics and Astronomy and the study's first author, said the findings back up decades of theoretical expectations.\n\n\"This surprising result encourages scientists to look deeper into such unique materials, potentially changing how we understand magnets and the behavior of materials in the extreme quantum regime,\" Gao said.\n\nCo-authors of this study include Félix Desrochers and Yong Baek Kim of the University of Toronto; Rice alumnus David Tam of the Paul Scherrer Institut; Silke Paschen, Diana Kirschbaum and Duy Ha Nguyen of Vienna University of Technology; Paul Steffens and Arno Hiess of the Institut Laue-Langevin; Yixi Su of Jülich Centre of Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum; and Sang-Wook Cheong of Rutgers University.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Robert A.

    "description": "The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.",
    "fullText": "Welcome to our annual list of the worst, least successful, and simply dumbest technologies of the year.\n\nThis year, politics was a recurring theme. Donald Trump swept back into office and used his executive pen to reshape the fortunes of entire sectors, from renewables to cryptocurrency. The wrecking-ball act began even before his inauguration, when the president-elect marketed his own memecoin, $TRUMP, in a shameless act of merchandising that, of course, we honor on this year’s worst tech list.\n\nWe like to think there’s a lesson in every technological misadventure. But when technology becomes dependent on power, sometimes the takeaway is simpler: it would have been better to stay away.\n\nThat was a conclusion Elon Musk drew from his sojourn as instigator of DOGE, the insurgent cost-cutting initiative that took a chainsaw to federal agencies. The public protested. Teslas were set alight, and drivers of his hyped Cybertruck discovered that instead of a thumbs-up, they were getting the middle finger.\n\nOn reflection, Musk said he wouldn’t do it again. “Instead of doing DOGE, I would have, basically … worked on my companies,” he told an interviewer this month. “And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars.”\n\nRegrets—2025 had a few. Here are some of the more notable ones.\n\nImagine a metal butler that fills your dishwasher and opens the door. It’s a dream straight out of science fiction. And it’s going to remain there—at least for a while.\n\nThat was the hilarious, and deflating, takeaway from the first reviews of NEO, a 66-pound humanoid robot whose maker claims it will “handle any of your chores reliably” when it ships next year.\n\nBut as a reporter for the Wall Street Journal learned, NEO took two minutes to fold a sweater and couldn’t crack a walnut. Not only that, but the robot was teleoperated the entire time by a person wearing a VR visor.\n\nStill interested? Neo is available on preorder for $20,000 from startup 1X.\n\nMore: I Tried the Robot That’s Coming to Live With You.

And its biggest product in a decade—ChatGPT—often behaves exactly that way.\n\nThis year, OpenAI released an especially sycophantic update that told users their mundane queries were brilliantly incisive. This electronic yes-man routine isn’t an accident; it’s a product strategy. Plenty of people like the flattery.\n\nBut it’s disingenuous and dangerous, too. Chatbots have shown a willingness to indulge users’ delusions and worst impulses, up to and including suicide.\n\nIn April, OpenAI acknowledged the issue when the company dialed back a model update whose ultra-agreeable personality, it said, had the side effect of “validating doubts, fueling anger, urging impulsive actions, or reinforcing negative emotions.”\n\nDon’t you dare agree the problem is solved. This month, when I fed ChatGPT one of my dumbest ideas, its response began: “I love this concept.”\n\nMore: What OpenAI Did When ChatGPT Users Lost Touch With Reality (New York Times), Sycophantic AI Decreases Prosocial Intentions and Promotes Dependence (arXiv), Expanding on what we missed with sycophancy (OpenAI)\n\nWhen you tell a lie, tell it big. Make it frolic and give it pointy ears. And make it white. Very white.\n\nThat’s what the Texas biotech concern Colossal Biosciences did when it unveiled three snow-white animals that it claimed were actual dire wolves, which went extinct more than 10 millennia ago.\n\nTo be sure, these genetically modified gray wolves were impressive feats of engineering. They’d been made white via a genetic mutation and even had some bits and bobs of DNA copied over from old dire wolf bones. But they “are not dire wolves,” according to canine specialists at the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\nColossal’s promotional blitz could hurt actual endangered species. Presenting de-extinction as “a ready-to-use conservation solution,” said the IUCN, “risks diverting attention from the more urgent need of ensuring functioning and healthy ecosystems.”\n\nIn a statement, Colossal said that sentiment analysis of online activity shows 98% agreement with its furry claims. “They’re dire wolves, end of story,” it says.\n\nMore: Game of Clones: Colossal’s new wolves are cute, but are they dire?

Kennedy Jr., “mRNA” has become a political slur.\n\nIn August, Kennedy abruptly canceled hundreds of millions in contracts for next-generation vaccines. And shot maker Moderna—once America’s champion—has seen its stock slide by more than 90% since its Covid peak.\n\nThe purge targeting a key molecule of life (our bodies are full of mRNA) isn’t just bizarre. It could slow down other mRNA-based medicine, like cancer treatments and gene editing for rare diseases.\n\nIn August, a trade group fought back, saying: “Kennedy’s unscientific and misguided vilification of mRNA technology and cancellation of grants is the epitome of cutting off your nose to spite your face.”\n\nMore: HHS Winds Down mRNA Vaccine Development (US Department of Health and Human Services),  Cancelling mRNA studies is the highest irresponsibility (Nature), How Moderna, the company that helped save the world, unraveled (Stat News)\n\nWikipedia has editions in 340 languages. But as of this year, there’s one less: Wikipedia in Greenlandic is no more.\n\nOnly around 60,000 people speak the Inuit language. And very few of them, it seems, ever cared much about the online encyclopedia. As a result, many of the entries were machine translations riddled with errors and nonsense.\n\nPerhaps a website no one visits shouldn’t be a problem. But its existence created the risk of a linguistic “doom spiral” for the endangered language. That could happen if new AIs were trained on the corrupt Wikipedia articles.\n\nIn September, administrators voted to close Greenlandic Wikipedia, citing possible “harm to the Greenlandic language.”\n\nThere’s a reason we’re late to the hate-fest around Elon Musk’s Cybertruck. That’s because 12 months ago, the polemical polygon was the #1 selling electric pickup in the US.\n\nSo maybe it would end up a hit.\n\nNope. Tesla is likely to sell only around 20,000 trucks this year, about half last year’s total. And a big part of the problem is that the entire EV pickup category is struggling. Just this month, Ford decided to scrap its own EV truck, the F-150 Lightning.\n\nWith unsold inventory building, Musk has started selling Cybertrucks as fleet vehicles to his other enterprises, like SpaceX.\n\nMore: Elon’s Edsel: Tesla Cybertruck Is The Auto Industry’s Biggest Flop In Decades (Forbes), Why Tesla Cybertrucks Aren't Selling (CNBC), Ford scraps fully-electric F-150 Lightning as mounting losses and falling demand hits EV plans (AP)\n\nDonald Trump launched a digital currency called $TRUMP just days before his 2025 inauguration, accompanied by a logo showing his fist-pumping “Fight, fight, fight” pose.\n\nThis was a memecoin, or shitcoin, not real money. Memecoins are more like merchandise—collectibles designed to be bought and sold, usually for a loss. Indeed, they’ve been likened to a consensual scam in which a coin’s issuer can make a bundle while buyers take losses.\n\nThe White House says there’s nothing amiss. “The American public believe[s] it's absurd for anyone to insinuate that this president is profiting off of the presidency,” said spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt in May.\n\nMore: Donald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure (Bloomberg), A crypto mogul who invested millions into Trump coins is getting a reprieve (CNN), How the Trump companies made $1 bn from crypto (Financial Times), Staff Statement on Meme Coins (SEC)\n\nIn 2023, Apple announced its “first-ever carbon-neutral product,” a watch with “zero” net emissions. It would get there using recycled materials and renewable energy, and by preserving forests or planting vast stretches of eucalyptus trees.\n\nCritics say it’s greenwashing. This year, lawyers filed suit in California against Apple for deceptive advertising, and in Germany, a court ruled that the company can’t advertise products as carbon neutral because the “supposed storage of CO2 in commercial eucalyptus plantations” isn’t a sure thing.\n\nApple’s marketing team relented. Packaging for its newest watches doesn’t say “carbon neutral.” But Apple believes the legal nitpicking is counterproductive, arguing that it can only “discourage the kind of credible corporate climate action the world needs.”\n\nMore: Inside the controversial tree farms powering Apple’s carbon neutral goal (MIT Technology Review), Apple Watch not a 'CO2-neutral product,' German court finds (Reuters), Apple 2030: Our ambition to become carbon neutral (Apple)\n\nWe asked Al Jean, the longest-serving showrunner, about all the conspiracy theories.\n\nIt’s a popular example of the “Mandela effect,” or a collective false memory.

    "description": "Discover the inside story of Google Sans, Google’s iconic brand typeface. From product lockups to code, learn how the Google Sans font family has evolved to solve specific UX design problems.",
    "fullText": "How seven design problems shaped Google’s iconic typeface — from inception to going open-source\n\nSometimes, design elements are birthed in flashes of inspiration — What if our interfaces were like paper? What if YouTube was a little more pink? — but not Google’s brand typeface.\n\nGoogle Sans is the iconic typeface used across every Google product from Search to Wallet. It’s one of the most-served fonts on the internet, clocking in at some 120 billion font requests a month. It wasn’t born from a single brilliant sprint or creative spark. It evolved as the answer to a set of specific design problems, an answer that continued to expand and adapt to meet the shifting needs of users, designers, and developers. Now, after nearly a decade on Pixel phones and in Google apps, Google Sans is making its next big move: going open-source.\n\nRead on for a brief history of Google’s beloved font, told through the design problems that shaped it.\n\nThe 2015 logo redesign was a smashing success. But even before its pixels were perfected, the team realized their work was only just beginning. Hundreds of product lockups — the fixed arrangement of the logo paired with each product name — had to be updated to match.\n\n“The majority of how people experience the Google brand is through typography, whether that’s in a product, marketing, or content. We had the Google logo and identity framework, but we were missing that connective tissue,” explains Ken Frederick, former UX Lead for Google’s Brand Studio.\n\nDesigners considered treating each lockup as a unique logo, but the sheer volume of work made this approach unscalable. So, a new typeface was born based on the clean geometric forms of the new logo: Product Sans. The font’s repeating geometric shapes and tightly spaced characters made it perfectly suited for big product names at big sizes. Many Google apps still use these lockups today.\n\nIf a designer sees a gorgeous typeface, they’ll want to use it. Team members in Marketing loved the look of Product Sans and asked for it to be expanded for use in advertising. But in practice, the typeface fell short when you only had a couple of seconds to catch consumers’ eyes. At the same time, product designers started playing around with using Product Sans in interfaces. The results? Not great. Product Sans wasn’t optimal for lengthy passages of text, or at the smaller text sizes used on phones and tablets. Google’s designers needed a more versatile brand typeface. Enter: Google Sans.\n\n“It wasn't a top-down decision,” notes Tobias Kunisch, Design Lead for Google Fonts. “Google Sans was driven by the needs of designers, with product teams showing what was needed. That’s how our brand font really came together.”\n\nThe Google Fonts team learned from their experience with Product Sans and asked Colophon Foundry to meticulously optimize the character shapes, terminals, ascenders, descenders, x-heights, and stroke contrasts of the new typeface, ensuring that Google Sans would perform beautifully in large display text across both marketing and product surfaces. This is the iconic Google typeface that you see everywhere from billboards to UI headlines.\n\nWhen Google Sans rolled out in 2018, designers were initially ecstatic. “It meant we could finally use typography for a stronger brand statement,” recalls UX Designer Miche Alvarez. “But it also created a dual-font system using Google Sans for larger display text and Roboto for smaller text. It ended up being a compromise.”\n\nDesigners fought for a Google Sans version that would work at smaller sizes. So the team collaborated with designers in Search and at Colophon Foundry to refine the font, ultimately launching Google Sans Text (GST) in 2020.\n\nUnlike the geometric Google Sans, the characters in Google Sans Text are taller, more condensed, and less circular. The typeface also includes more spacing between characters to aid readability. The numerals are less geometric, and the angled cuts on terminals are less severe, creating a more uniform and readable experience, even at small sizes. It was also designed to match the proportions of Roboto, Android’s default typeface, to make switching from Roboto a smoother process.\n\nGoogle Sans Text rolled out on the Pixel 3, creating a more unified typographic experience.\n\nProduct teams eagerly adopted Google Sans and Google Sans Text but soon highlighted a new issue: Billions of people around the globe use non-Latin scripts like Arabic, Chinese, and Thai — writing systems not included in the initial character sets of Google Sans.\n\n“Our mission is ‘to organize the world's information,’” explains Dave Crossland, the Lead UX Program Manager for Google Fonts. “There was a clear need to expand Google Sans to all the languages that Google’s products get localized into.”\n\nThe effort was monumental. It meant meticulously crafting hundreds of thousands of new glyphs across more than 20 additional writing systems, each with its own unique design principles and visual nuances. The undertaking involved collaborating with expert type foundries worldwide, specialists familiar with the intricate requirements of each script — from the flowing curves of Arabic to the complex strokes of Japanese and the distinct forms of Ge’ez, the script used for Ethiopian and other languages in that region.\n\nAll together, this massive global language support makes Google Sans one of the world’s largest typeface families.\n\nGoogle Sans Mono was created in 2020 to support contexts that needed fixed-width characters for editorial design, at medium and large text sizes. Despite this, it soon got its first big product integration, replacing Roboto Mono in Google Chat. The only problem? Developers hated it.\n\nBecause the font wasn’t intended to be used at smaller sizes, the letterforms weren’t legible. It was especially difficult to tell the a and o apart. “That can actually be catastrophic for code,” says Tobias Kunisch. “One misplaced character can break an entire program.”\n\nRecognizing this critical need, a dedicated effort was launched to craft Google Sans Code, a monospaced typeface specifically designed to make code more readable. This involved thorough research into the 20 most common programming languages and how developers interact with code, aiming to make the new coding typeface more visually appealing while reducing the ambiguity of similar-looking letterforms. Based on these insights, Google tasked the Universal Thirst foundry to meticulously focus on specific letters, numbers, and operators to meet these requirements. The result is an eminently readable and surprisingly playful typeface.\n\nGoogle Sans Code launched as an open-source font in 2025, and is the typeface used to display code in Gemini.\n\nAs interfaces grow more dynamic and personal, our designers need typography that does more than just present information; the type should also convey feeling and adapt to varying contexts and states. While Google Sans was clear and effective, it didn’t offer the nuanced expressive range required to truly match a product’s mood or a user’s preference.\n\nThis led us to collaborate with the pioneers in variable font technology at Font Bureau to create Google Sans Flex. Unlike traditional fonts that have a handful of fixed styles like bold and italic, Google Sans Flex offers granular control over six different design axes: weight, width, optical size, slant, grade, and roundedness.\n\n“Google Sans Flex is a power tool for expression,” says Google Fonts Product Manager Sophia Siao. “Different combinations of axes can unlock a huge range of feeling and emotion, all while preserving a cohesive reading experience.”\n\nGoogle Sans Flex lets designers “sculpt” UI text with remarkable precision. Imagine making text feel “calm as a whisper” or “loud and rugged” simply by adjusting its weight, or evoking a “personal, playful” tone by fine-tuning its roundness. Our designers were particularly excited by the ability to precisely adjust how rounded or soft the text appears; these subtle shifts deeply influence how readers experience and connect with a design.\n\nThis expressive power isn’t just about aesthetics; it directly impacts how users experience Google products. Our research engaged over 3,000 readers, which taught us one thing: flexibility matters. Readers found the taller, more elegant styles to be more premium and engaging than standard fonts. This adaptability doesn't just look better; it allows designers to tailor readability for every specific use case. The optical size axis intelligently adapts letter shapes to maintain readable proportions at any size, from a smartwatch to a billboard, ensuring that expressiveness never comes at the expense of legibility. The typeface was recognized as a Red Dot Winner 2024.\n\nUltimately, Google Sans Flex empowers designers to infuse interfaces with distinct personality and nuance, creating digital experiences that feel more intuitive, personal, and genuinely helpful.\n\nGoogle Sans launched as a proprietary brand typeface — meaning that it could only be used in Google products. While that control was great for protecting Google’s brand, it created a fragmented typographic experience across the digital ecosystem. You might see Google Sans in Gmail, then open WhatsApp and see Roboto or a device-specific font. It’s a persistent, if subtle, point of friction.\n\n“It just doesn’t feel as nice,” stresses Visual Designer Megan Lynch. “On a subconscious level it impacts the experience.” This fragmented visual language, unlike the unified font experiences on some other platforms, made the digital journey less than seamless.\n\nSo this year — 2025 — Google decided to make Google Sans and Google Sans Flex open-source. It isn’t just about making a great font available; it’s about fostering a more consistent and polished digital environment for everyone. By offering Google Sans and Google Sans Flex to the wider community, we hope more developers and designers will bridge the visual gap between first-party and third-party apps. The goal is a more unified experience across devices and platforms, creating clearer, more comfortable interfaces for users wherever they engage with technology.\n\nThe story of Google Sans is a masterclass in need-based design — it was created not by a single flash of inspiration, but a thoughtful, human-centered evolution. Each problem, from misaligned lockups to illegible code, revealed an unmet need and ultimately led to innovation and improved user experience.\n\nTry Google Sans Flex, as well as our other fonts, at Google Fonts.\n\nSpecial thanks to the hundreds of people who have contributed to making and evolving Google Sans, including: Akaki Razmadze, Aleksandra Samulenkova, Alex Blattmann, Alexei Vanyashin, Ali Almasri, Anagha Narayanan, Anaïs Lievens, Andy Stewart, Anonta Mon, Anthony Sheret, Anurag Gautam, Anuthin Wongsunkakon, Ashler, Ben Mitchell (Fontpad), Bianca Berning, Black Foundry, Borna Izadpanah, Botio Nikoltchev, Cadson Demak, Carmen Eva Marseille, Chris Simpkins, Colophon Foundry, Dalton Maag, Damien Correll, Daniel Grumer, Daniel Yacob, Dave Crossland, David Berlow, Denis Moyogo Jacquerye, Edd Harrington, Eduardo Rennó, Elena Peralta, Erin McLaughlin, Fiona Ross, Font Bureau, Fontef, Gor Design, Gor Jihanian, Gunjan Panchal, Gunnar Vilhjálmsson, Hanna Donker, Harry Dalton, Hilary Palmén, Hitesh Malaviya, Irene Vlachou, Jack McCabe, Jamra Patel, Jany Belluz, Jimmy Mooney, Joana Ranito, Jonathan Lee, Jonny Pinhorn, Jotika Khur-Yearn, Kalapi Gajjar, Khaled Hosny, Knaz Uiyamathiti, Lipi Raval, Mamoun Sakkal, Marc Foley, Marianna Paszkowska, Mark Jamra, Megan Lynch, Meir Sadan, Michele Patanè, Mike Guss, Mohamed Gaber, Namrata Goyal, Nance Cunningham, Natalia Qadreh, Neil Patel, Nikolaus Waxweiler, Omer Ziv, Pablo Bosch, Panuwat Usakunwathana, Pathum Egodawatta, Patrick McCormick, Pratyush Das, Riccardo De Franceschi, Richard Bailey, Ricky Atkins, Salomi Desai, Samir Souza Reis, Santiago Orozco, Simon Cozens, Sophia Siao, Sovichet Tep, Stephen Morey, Suppakit Chalermlarp, Tobias Kunisch, U+ Type, Universal Thirst, Vaishnavi Murthy, Yanek Iontef, and Ye Myat Lwin.\n\nShout out to Sarah Daily and Susanna Zaraysky for additional reporting.

    "fullText": "A new poll indicates that support for President Trump is dwindling. Shockingly, that decline seems to be chiefly among MAGA and party-line Republicans. Support for the MAGA movement has also declined, with more Republicans identifying with the party rather than with Trump.\n\nThe new NBC News poll shows that the number of Americans who “strongly approve” of Trump has dropped from 26% in April to 21% now. The same survey also found the number of MAGA Republicans dropped from 78% to 70% in the same period.\n\nOn the flip side, the number of people who “strongly disapprove” of Trump increased from 42% to 44% from April to now. MAGA itself has also seen a decline since April, with the number of Republicans viewing themselves as part of the movement falling from 57% to 50%.\n\nMany of those surveyed cited financial concerns, particularly those surrounding food, affordable housing, and health care, as being the most critical issue to them. Many households are tightening their belts by cutting back on groceries, entertainment, and holiday spending.\n\nWhile overall inflation is down to 3%, costs have decreased for only a few goods, and wages haven’t increased meaningfully for most workers. As a result, some economists fear that stagflation might be a risk heading into 2026. Trump’s promise to end inflation and revitalize the economy has rang hollow for many voters. After a year, the majority of those surveyed found themselves in the same or worse position than a year ago.\n\nThe erosion is subtle but notable. Republican voters are not necessarily moving left, but they are showing fatigue with personality-driven politics. The poll suggests a growing desire for stability, predictability, and concrete economic relief. Whether that sentiment translates into lower turnout, primary challenges, or quiet disengagement could shape the party’s strategy heading into the 2026 midterm election cycle.\n\nThe post Poll Shows Shocking Trump Approval Number Change appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "title": "China may have reverse engineered EUV lithography tool in covert lab, report claims — employees given fake IDs to avoid secret project being detected, prototypes expected in 2028",
    "description": "China has reportedly built and begun testing a secret EUV lithography prototype using ASML-style laser-produced plasma technology. Yet, despite generating 13.5-nm light, the system remains unable to make chips and appears to be years away from achieving a complete, production-ready EUV manufacturing capability.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nA secret laboratory in China has quietly assembled a prototype extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography system and is now testing it stealthily, which means that the country may be close to replicating the most advanced technology that currently exists on Earth, reports Reuters.\n\nThe tool was reportedly developed by reverse engineering existing scanners from ASML and is said to be on-track to make prototype chips in 2028. If the information is correct, then Chinese scientists have made numerous breakthroughs across multiple disciplines in just a few years instead of decades, a scenario that appears extremely unlikely. Further analysis of the report indicates that China's laboratory is far from completing the tool, meaning that the country is years away from making chips using EUV lithography.\n\nThe system was reportedly completed in early 2025 inside a highly secured facility in Shenzhen and occupies nearly an entire factory floor. The Chinese machine reportedly generates EUV light with a wavelength of 13.5nm using the same laser-produced plasma (LPP) method as ASML Twinscan NXE machines, not the particle accelerator-based steady-state microbunching (SSMB) method designed at Tsinghua University or discharge-produced plasma (DPP) technology developed at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), which might prove the point that the system was reverse-engineered or at least contains a substantial amount of technologies pioneered by ASML.\n\nASML's laser-produced plasma (LPP) method uses tiny molten tin droplets, roughly 25–30 microns in diameter, which are injected into a vacuum chamber at a rate of about 50,000 droplets per second. Then, a high-power CO₂ laser first fires a low-intensity pre-pulse at each droplet, flattening it into a disk-like shape, followed by a more powerful main pulse that vaporizes the flattened tin and creates a superheated plasma with temperatures exceeding 200,000°C. This plasma emits isotropic EUV light, which is then collected by a large multilayer collector mirror and directed into the lithography system's reflective optics for patterning silicon wafers. This process repeats tens of thousands of times per second.\n\nThe machine is reportedly larger than the original, but it is operational in the sense that it can generate EUV radiation. However, it has not progressed to make usable chips as it still struggles to replicate 'the precision optical systems' features by Twinscan NXE systems. Furthermore, there is no word about power of the EUV light source, a crucial parameter that defines whether a tool can or cannot be used for volume production.\n\nThe report clearly states that the Chinese EUV scanner cannot currently be used to make chips, but the Chinese government reportedly wants the first chip prototypes to emerge in 2028, two or three years down the road. However, a more realistic target is 2030, four or five years from now, which is a long time. Meanwhile, from the report, it is not completely clear what stage the Chinese team is at today.\n\nThe report does not disclose which specific components of the optical system are the primary bottlenecks, as the article groups them rather generally. In particular, it is uncertain if the alleged EUV tool struggles to replicate the ultra-precise collector mirror system coated with multilayer molybdenum-silicon (Mo/Si) stacks, illuminator optics (which shapes and uniforms the beam using faceted mirrors), or projection optics (a series of aspheric mirrors for 4X – 8X reduction imaging with sub-nanometer wavefront errors). ASML outsources the development and production of these components to Carl Zeiss from Germany. If the developers failed to replicate the collector itself, then the rest of the machine can hardly be called an EUV lithography system, as technically, the only thing they have is some kind of light source that they have yet to learn how to use. Yet, even if the developers cannot replicate illuminator optics or projection optics (suggesting that the collector itself is there), it still means they do not have even a poorly working EUV lithography tool, but rather a set of certain components.\n\nWhen talking about advanced lithography equipment, we must keep in mind that such tools rely on seamless integration of sophisticated light sources, advanced optics, ultra-precise mechanical engineering, complex control software, and specialized materials, all of which must function reliably within nanometer-scale tolerances demanded by modern chip manufacturing. The story has no word about the state of the mechanical systems of the alleged tool: we know nothing about the wafer stocker system, wafer stages, or reticle stages, all of which are crucial for operation and yields.\n\nTo put China's EUV efforts into perspective, the secret lab is not even close to building an alpha tool. For now, what the Chinese lab has cannot even put the light on a wafer, save for printing lines and spaces, something ASML's tool could do in 2006, about 11 years before the company shipped its first Twinscan NXE:3400B system meant for high-volume manufacturing. Of course, reverse engineering certain components can give Chinese engineers a speed boost, but it remains to be seen how significant this one is going to be.\n\nAccording to Reuters's sources familiar with the effort, the Chinese EUV tool was 'developed' by a team that includes former engineers from ASML and recent university graduates, who allegedly reverse-engineered the company's EUV machines. The secret lab was so stealthy that its employees were given fake IDs to avoid detection of their concentration in one place by foreign spies.\n\nYet, it is unclear how any engineers from China could reverse engineer an EUV lithography scanner, as the Dutch company has never supplied one to China and hardly taught personnel from China how to service its EUV systems that are not allowed to be shipped to the People's Republic.\n\nReverse engineering a machine that contains over 100,000 parts is a hard task that takes hundreds of engineers with knowledge of the matter, which is why the secret entity led by the Government of China hired not only former engineers from ASML China, but also former employees of the Dutch company from elsewhere, presumably from Europe, Taiwan, and the U.S. For example, Lin Nan, formerly responsible for EUV light source technology at ASML, now leads a team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Shanghai Institute of Optics that has filed eight EUV-related patents in just 18 months. Yet, this may mean that he uses his experience and knowledge rather than trying to replicate what he did at ASML or reverse engineer what he did at ASML due to the absence of an EUV scanner in his lab.\n\n“It makes sense that companies would want to replicate our technology, but doing so is no small feat,” a statement by ASML published by Reuters reads.\n\nThe report says that around 100 recent university graduates are tasked with reverse-engineering parts from EUV and DUV lithography tools, with each workplace monitored by a dedicated camera that records the disassembly and reassembly process, an important part of the whole China's lithography program, according to the report. Employees who successfully put components back together receive bonuses. Yet again, a Twinscan NXE tool is a mechanism consisting of over 100,000 parts working together, not just a sum of all parts.\n\nTo sum up, China has reportedly built a secret prototype EUV lithography system and begun testing it, which suggests that the country may be closer to reproducing the most advanced chipmaking technology in existence than previously believed. However, details provided by the report indicate that China is still years — if not a decade — away from making chips using EUV lithography.\n\nThe machine can generate 13.5-nm EUV light using the same laser-produced plasma (LPP) method employed by ASML, which may demonstrate extensive reverse engineering of Western technology rather than the use of alternative domestic approaches. However, the tool is significantly larger than commercial systems available today, it cannot produce usable chips, and appears to struggle with other elements of EUV lithography, particularly ultra-precise optics supplied to ASML by Carl Zeiss. In fact, details about the system like light source power, optical subsystem maturity, and the state of critical mechanical components remain unclear.\n\nWhile China expects first prototype EUV chips to emerge in 2028, Reuters's sources suggest 2030 is more realistic. Yet, the whole effort relies heavily on recruiting former ASML engineers and reverse engineering parts from existing EUV and DUV tools, which are not only hard to develop, but are extremely hard to make. Meanwhile, there is no word whether the current team responsible for disassembling and reassembling components can actually make an ultra-complex machine consisting of over 100,000 parts work flawlessly to produce semiconductors in high volumes.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.",

    "description": "Authorities announced they tracked down the man responsible for the deadly Brown University shooting that rocked the Ivy League institution.",
    "fullText": "Authorities on Dec. 18 announced they tracked down the man responsible for both the deadly Brown University shooting and the shooting death of Nuno F.G. Loureiro, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor two days later, and found him dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at a Salem, Massachusetts storage unit.\n\nClaudio Manuel Neves Valente, 48, originally from Portugal, was a former Brown University PhD physics student, who knew Loureiro, authorities said at two separate news conferences on the night of Dec. 18.\n\nInvestigators said they identified Valente on the afternoon of Dec. 17 and were able to connect him to both crime scenes through financial background information, including car rental records for the car he rented and drove to Providence and back to Massachusetts.\n\nThe Brown shootings rocked the Ivy League School and the school's surrounding community.\n\nAuthorities at the news conference in Boston, said Valente was \"sophisticated in covering his tracks,\" including obscuring his cell phone so it couldn't be tracked, switching plates on his rental car andnot using credit cards in his name.\n\nAn affidavit signed by a Rhode Island district judge said police cracked the case after a tipster recognized a rental car circling the area. The tipster said police should be looking for a gray Nissan Altima and license plate, information the police hadn't previously released. Police then tracked down images of Neves Valente renting the car at an Alamo location in Boston.\n\nHere's what to know about the shooter:\n\nNeves Valente entered the country in 2000 on a student F-1 visa. He was admitted as a lawful permanent resident in 2017.\n\nBrown officials say he was a PhD student before taking a leave of absence in April 2001. He withdrew on July 31, 2003. His last known address was in Miami, according to police.\n\nThe tipster took his information first to the social media site Reddit, posting: \"I'm being dead serious. The police need to look into a grey Nissan with Florida plates, possibly a rental,\" John, whose last name is being withheld by authorities, wrote, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe announcement comes after authorities urged the public to help with the widening investigation and dayslong search for the person suspected of carrying out the attack. Earlier in the week, authorities released enhanced images and video footage of the person investigators believe could be tied to the shooting that killed two people and injured nine others.\n\nProvidence Police Chief Oscar Perez said investigators had evidence that the possible suspect was near the university hours before the shooting. Footage from neighborhood cameras shared by authorities showed the person in dark clothing and wearing a mask walking along streets a few blocks away from the campus on Dec. 13.\n\nInvestigators believe it was likely the person was \"casing\" the scene, according to Perez.\n\n\"There's a lot of leads we have here that show that the person who committed this tragedy is the guy in this video,\" the police chief said.\n\nThough officials said on Dec. 16 that they were confident the person in the video is the suspect, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha noted that they had \"zero\" evidence for the motive in the attack. Witnesses said the person was likely in his 30s, and it was unclear if they were affiliated with the university, Perez said.\n\n'Bright light' and 'role model.' Brown University victims remembered\n\nPolice received more than 200 tips since the shooting, according to Perez. The police chief had asked for the public’s help in identifying the suspected gunman, saying investigators were hoping the new footage would help someone recognize the person.\n\n\"Focus on the body movements, the way the person moved their arms, the body posture, the way they carry the weight,\" Perez said. “I think those are important movement patterns that may help you identify this individual, which is extremely important.”\n\nThe footage included a timeline video that comprised surveillance video from neighborhood cameras and a vehicle’s dash camera.\n\nIn one video, the suspected shooter can be seen leaving the scene of the shooting as a police car with flashing emergency lights arrives. The final video shows the suspect walking along that street just minutes after the attack.\n\nThe shooting at the Ivy League University occurred shortly before 4:05 p.m. local time on Dec. 13 in an engineering building with unlocked doors as final exams were underway. Authorities said the suspect opened fire with a 9mm gun inside a classroom and then fled.\n\nThe shooting prompted a campus lockdown that left students barricaded in rooms or hiding for hours. Officers recovered 9mm shell casings from the scene, and Perez said investigators believe the suspect \"definitely targeted Brown University.\"\n\nTwo students were killed, and nine others were injured in the attack. The two students killed were identified as Ella Cook, a sophomore from Mountain Brook, Alabama, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, a freshman from Virginia who immigrated from Uzbekistan.\n\nAs of Dec. 16, two of the wounded students were released from the hospital. Of the seven people who remained hospitalized, authorities said one was in critical condition, five were in critical but stable condition, and one was in stable condition.\n\nBrown University, which has nearly 11,000 undergraduate and graduate students, is considered one of the most prestigious colleges in the country. Brown was founded in 1764 and is located in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Brown, MIT suspect found dead.

    "description": "“Where these sea raiders might have come from, and why they attacked the island of Als has long been a mystery.”",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nResearchers discovered a fingerprint on Scandinavia’s oldest plank boat, used by seaborne raiders over 2,000 years ago.\n\nThe print was left in the caulking tar by one of the boat’s makers.\n\nExperts still hope the fingerprint can point to clues about who the raiders were and why they attacked the island of Als.\n\nThe mystery of why a group of seaborne raiders attacked the Danish island of Als over 2,000 years ago just got one step closer to being solved. Researchers scoured Scandinavia’s oldest plank boat (likely used by the raiders), and discovered a fingerprint pressed into the tar caulking material. While this is an admittedly small piece of evidence, archaeologists still hope it can move them closer to figuring out just where the attackers came from.\n\nThe attack on the island of Als happened in the fourth century B.C.E., when an armada descended. Even with up to four boats in the attack, the island-dwellers were able to defend their home, sinking one of the boats in a bog (likely as an offering of thankfulness for victory) in the process. The boat—which was was first discovered in the 1880s and excavated in the 1920s—is now known as the Hjortspring boat, and is the only example of a prehistoric plank boat ever found in Scandinavia.\n\n“Where these sea raiders might have come from, and why they attacked the island of Als has long been a mystery,” Mikael Fauvelle, an archaeologist from Lund University, said in a statement.\n\nWith the Hjortspring boat on display at the National Museum of Denmark, the university research team still unexpectedly found parts of the boat that hadn’t been chemically preserved, and studied them with modern tools. “The boat was waterproofed with pine pitch, which was surprising,” Fauvelle said. “This suggests the boat was built somewhere with abundant pine forests.”\n\nPreviously, scholars thought that the raiders must haveoriginated from modern-day Hamburg, Germany. But the researchers, who published their findings on the investigation into the lost pieces of the Hjortspring boat in the journal PLOS One, now say that the clues point to the Baltic Sea region as the origin point of the attack. The authors wrote that the use of pine pitch means the boats must have been made in a region abundant with pine forests, like the Baltic Sea region east of Rugen and Scania.\n\n“If the boat came from the pine forest-rich coastal regions of the Baltic Sea, it means that the warriors who attacked the island of Als chose to launch a maritime raid over hundreds of kilometers of open sea,” Fauvelle said.\n\nThe researchers used all the tools at their disposal to investigate the find, including carbon dating the lime bast cordage, which confirmed its pre-Roman Iron Age dating. They also used X-ray tomography for high-resolution scans, created a 3D model of the fingerprint, and employed chromatography and mass spectrometry to help see how the caulking tar was produced.\n\n“We are also hoping to be able to extract ancient DNA from the caulking tar on the boat, which could give us more detailed information on the ancient people who used this boat,” Fauvelle said.\n\nAnalyzing intact cordage fragments and imprints of cordage on caulking material helped experts divine the sewing and rope-making techniques originally used in the construction, and the partial human fingerprint provides a direct link to the ancient seafarers. “Together, these results shed new light on the methods and materials used to build Scandinavia’s first plank boats,” the authors wrote, “and raise new questions regarding our understating of early maritime societies in Northern Europe.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "References in U.S. Coast Guard policy calling hate symbols “potentially divisive\" were removed Thursday, and a U.S. senator said she was lifting a hold she had placed on a nomination for the service's top job.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose agency oversees the Coast Guard, said on social media that the latest changes were made so no one can “misrepresent” the branch's position.\n\n“The pages of superseded and outdated policy will be completely removed from the record so no press outlet, entity or elected official may misrepresent the Coast Guard to politicize their policies and lie about their position on divisive and hate symbols,” Noem said.\n\nThe move appears to cap off back-and-forth revisions to Coast Guard policy on swastikas, nooses and other hate symbols, which has sparked an uproar. The Department of Homeland Security has said there “was never a ‘downgrade’” in policy language.\n\nNoem's announcement came a day after Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada said she was holding up the nomination of Adm. Kevin Lunday for Coast Guard commandant because leadership appeared to have “backtracked” on a commitment that swastikas and nooses are considered hate symbols and prohibited from display.\n\nRosen said Thursday on social media that she was lifting the hold and looked forward to working with Lunday to continue strengthening anti-harassment policy at the Coast Guard.\n\n“While I continue to have reservations about the process by which this happened and the confusion created by leadership at the Department of Homeland Security, I am pleased to see that the policy now directly refers to stronger language against swastikas and nooses,” she said.\n\nNoem called the delay of Lunday's nomination a “politicized holdup,” saying it had gone on long enough and he should be confirmed without delay.\n\n“He has given nearly 39 years of distinguished service to the Coast Guard, this country, and the American people,” she said.\n\nThe Coast Guard’s planned policy change calling hate symbols \"potentially divisive\" emerged publicly last month. It stopped short of banning them, instead saying that commanders could take steps to remove them from public view and that the rule did not apply to private spaces, such as family housing.\n\nDHS has said the change “strengthens our ability to report, investigate, and prosecute those who violate longstanding policy.”\n\nThe Coast Guard said on social media that it “maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward hate symbols, extremist ideology, and any conduct that undermines our core values. We prohibit the display or promotion of hate symbols in any form. Any suggestion otherwise is false.\"\n\nThe Washington Post first reported the latest developments.",

    "fullText": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Investigators in New England have identified the suspected Brown University shooter and are looking into whether there is a link to the murder of an award-winning nuclear scientist 50 miles away at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, sources tell Fox News.\n\nHe remains at large, and authorities have obtained a warrant, according to the sources. They confirmed that officers are in Salem, New Hampshire, where the suspected shooter’s abandoned car was found near a storage facility.\n\nPolice scanner audio reveals police were searching for a gray Nissan Sentra with Maine plates in Salem, New Hampshire, in connection with a homicide in Brookline, Massachusetts, where MIT nuclear physicist Nuno Loureiro was found with gunshot wounds in his apartment Monday night.\n\nTrump Urges Capture Of 'Animal' Gunman In Brown University Shooting, Says No Motive Yet\n\nEarlier this week, FBI Boston's special agent in charge Ted Docks told reporters that investigators were sharing intelligence regarding both cases but had not come up with a clear tie.\n\nUnverified reports in both Providence, Rhode Island, and Brookline, Massachusetts, have described Nissan Sentras at the scene, although they were described as having license plates from different states.\n\nOn Thursday, the regional CBS affiliate WPRI-TV reported that senior law enforcement sources said they have discovered evidence of a connection. It's unclear what that evidence is.\n\nA masked gunman barged into a lecture hall at Brown University in Providence around 4 p.m. Saturday and killed two students, injuring nine more. Authorities said they recovered 9mm bullet casings from the scene.\n\nA person of interest was seen Saturday a few minutes later on surveillance video in the neighborhood east of Brown's campus.\n\n'Older' Brown Building Where Shooting Happened Had No Cameras As President’s Even Older Home Appears Equipped\n\nThen around 8:30 p.m. Monday, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Nuno F.

He was pronounced dead at a hospital the following morning.\n\nLoureiro was a renowned nuclear physicist, director of MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion Center and a recipient of a presidential award honoring his research from the White House earlier this year.\n\nAuthorities have not described what kind of weapon was used to kill Loureiro.\n\nThe shooting left two students dead, identified as Ella Cook of Alabama and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov of Virginia, and nine injured.

    "description": "Defense One first reported that the funding for those checks actually comes from reconciliation funds that were approved by Congress to subsidize housing allowances for service members.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is already facing backlash for his so-called “warrior dividend” he announced during his national address on Wednesday night.\n\nTrump announced that 1.45 million military servicemembers will be receiving a $1,776 check ahead of Christmas as a result of tariff revenue and his “big beautiful bill” signed earlier this year. But skeptics immediately questioned how Trump was able to authorize sending out individual checks to service members without approval from Congress.\n\n“1,450,000 military service members will receive a special, we call warrior dividend before Christmas, a warrior dividend. In honor of our nation’s founding in 1776, we are sending every soldier $1,776. Think of that. And the checks are already on the way,” Trump said during his speech.\n\n“We made a lot more money than anybody thought because of tariffs, and the bill helped us along. Nobody deserves it more than our military. And I say congratulations to everybody. And by the way, we now have record enlistment in our military, and last year we had among the worst recruitment numbers in our military’s history. What a difference a year makes,” he added.\n\nHowever, online publication Defense One first reported that the funding for those checks actually comes from reconciliation funds that were approved by Congress to subsidize housing allowances for service members.\n\nA senior administration official told Defense One that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed the Pentagon “disburse $2.6 billion as a one-time basic allowance for housing supplement” to all eligible service members.\n\n“Congress appropriated $2.9 billion to the Department of War to supplement the Basic Allowance for Housing entitlement within The One Big Beautiful Bill,” the senior official told Defense One in a statement. “Approximately 1.28 million active component military members and 174,000 Reserve component military members will receive this supplement.”\n\nOVERNIGHT: President Trump’s $1,776 checks for 1.45 million troops announced Wednesday night come from Congressionally-allocated reconciliation funds intended to subsidize housing allowances for service members, a senior official confirmed to @DefenseOne.https://t.co/mGWski9Exl\n\n— Thomas Novelly (@TomNovelly) December 18, 2025\n\nThe report immediately sparked criticism on social media platform X.\n\n“I was wondering how Trump found his troop pay money without a congressional authorization/appropriation. He found it by taking it away from troop housing money. Always a con artist,” The Atlantic’s David Frum wrote on X.\n\nFormer Rep. Joe Walsh wrote: “Classic Trump. Everything he does is a lie, everything he does is just bullshit repackaging.”\n\nMeidasTouch editor-in-chief Ron Filipkowski posted: “Trump is taking money out their housing allowances approved by Congress and giving it to them in a ‘bonus’ so it looks like it came from him. It’s just a shell game with military pay from the ultimate con man.”\n\nNew Jersey Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D) said the “warrior dividend” is “no more than rebranded military housing allowances.”\n\n“Trump isn’t giving our brave service members a bonus, he’s just shuffling around money so he can claim he is. The level of disrespect for the intelligence of our troops is staggering,” she wrote on X.\n\nU.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), a veteran, also bashed Trump’s announcement.\n\n“Gee thanks, Donald. Your $1,776 ‘warrior checks’ aren’t Christmas bonuses—you’re just stealing money out of a fund meant to help our troops find affordable housing. Once a conman always a conman,\" Duckworth wrote.",

Colourful and highly stylised, it is a thoughtful study of burnout and recovery.\n\nInkle/Nintendo Switch, iPhone/iPad, Mac, PC\nAn attempted-murder mystery set in an a 1920s all-girls private school reveals itself to also be an eviscerating takedown of British class politics. Witty and beautifully drawn, it is full of amusing boarding-school stereotypes, from self-interested prefects to a terrifying matron, whose motivations and personal grievances must be slowly unpicked. It has the feel of a really excellent graphic novel.\n\nSupergiant Games, PC, Switch\n\n A stylish return to Greek mythology for developer Supergiant Games, this time starring daughter of the underworld Melinoë, who is trying to prevent the titan Chronos from destroying everything. You are aided in your attempts to kill Time by a range of absurdly attractive fellow immortals and vicious familiars. Repeated runs bring gradual mastery of Melinoë’s spells and weapons, tipping the scales of fate ever so slightly in your favour.\n\nSokpop Collectiv, PC\n\n A gardening sim that’s also a horror adventure, Grunn is a weird, often unsettling experiment in game design, set in a Dutch village inhabited by ghostly figures and intriguing secrets. Trim the lawn, collect photos, but be extremely careful when visiting the church or exploring that weird bunker beyond the hedgerow.\n\nMegagon Industries, PC, Xbox\n\n All is well with the world as you carve beautiful lines down pristine mountain snowscapes – until you smack into a rock or fly off a cliff, that is. Minimalist in both its aesthetic and its simple, stripped-back play, this is one of the best games ever made about skiing. Playing with other people adds a little enjoyable chaos to the experience, but Snow Riders is best when it’s just you and the mountain, and you’re testing your perseverance against a particularly challenging trail.\n\nNintendo, Switch 2\n\n Nintendo’s favourite ape returns in a wild take on the classic platform adventure, accompanied by series regular Pauline, who is able to attain shapeshifting magical powers. Instead of pixel-perfect jumps, you punch, crunch and blast your way through exotic locations, collecting power-ups and pulverising bosses, tearing up the Super Mario level design book as you go. Smashing.\n\nCapcom, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n Capcom’s spectacular monsters, from fluffy pink snarling apes to elder dragons that command lightning, have long been waiting for a world big enough to contain them. Wilds is that world: an expanse of desert, volcanic plains, jungle and icy peaks that provides the perfect habitats for an extraordinary, dangerous menagerie – and perfect arenas in which to fight them. The story is a thrill ride of escalatingly epic face-offs, but afterwards it opens up a vast menu of more challenging hunts.\n\nHazlelight Studios/Electronic Arts, PC, PS5, Switch, Xbox\n\n Two aspiring writers become trapped in each others’ stories in this eminently likable interactive take on buddy comedy. Except they’re not buddies: they’re polar opposites. Standoffish sci-fi writer Mio and happy-go-lucky fantasy writer Zoe come to understand each other better as they are forced to cooperate their way through the bizarre realms of their imagination Play transforms unpredictably every 20 minutes - one level could be all-action space-blasting, the next will have you puzzling through a fantasy jungle as transforming animals, and an unexpected diversion will have you working together to wriggle sentient hotdogs into buns. You’ll be brought closer to your player two as well, as navigating these collaborative scenarios requires communication, patience, and a sense of humour.\n\n11Bit Studios, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n After crash-landing on a planet supposedly rich in a valuable mineral, Jan Dolski finds himself all alone. The rest of the crew died on impact. So to keep the mission going, and escape an imminent sunrise that will fry him out of existence, he must clone himself to create a crew. After twenty-ish hours split between exploring a hostile planet, managing the base’s resources and managing the squabbles between all the alternate Jans, you will be left with a lot to ponder about how our life choices shape who we are.\n\nPanic, PC, PS4/5, Switch, Xbox\n\n Set at the time of Ecuador’s journey to the 2002 World Cup finals, Despelote is a beautifully designed semi-autobiographical adventure about a young boy and his obsession with the beautiful game. Focusing on families, childhood and the uniting power of fandom, it’s a unique take on the idea of a sports sim.\n\nTwo Point Studios/Sega, PC, PS5, Switch 2, Xbox\n\n The Two Point series of management sims has consistently combined humour and deep strategy to compelling effect, and the latest is no exception. Your role as museum manager is to gather exhibits from around the world then display them in an attractive setting to pull in visitors. Meanwhile there are staffing issues to contend with, and is your cafe serving nice enough snacks? It’s an engrossing challenge and the cartoon-style visuals provide plenty of amusing asides.\n\nSucker Punch/Sony, PS5\n\n A deliciously easy to enjoy and arrestingly beautiful samurai action game about a female warrior, Atsu, on a revenge quest, which unselfconsciously reproduces every possible trope of the genre, with panache. We have tense sword stand-offs under falling leaves. We have enemies eyeing each other menacingly from either side of a burning bridge. We have hot springs, shrines and quiet moments playing the shamisen or wielding a sumi-e ink brush. We have wolves and foxes leading us to secret spots in nature. And we have a selection of delightfully fun weapons and a seemingly endless horde of bandits and villains to use them on. Uncomplicated, beautifully made entertainment.\n\nKojima Productions/Sony, PS5\n\n Troubled delivery man and resistance hero Sam Bridges returns in Hideo Kojima’s visually astonishing, eccentric and engrossing sci-fi sequel. Moving the action to an apocalyptic Australia provides landscapes of stark beauty – and the odd kangaroo. And while the story is often indecipherable, the realisation of Kojima’s ghostly universe is incredible. This is a wasteland you can wallow in for months.\n\nSandfall/Keplar, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n An extravagantly French role-playing game in which a band of depressed people from a ravaged Paris set out to kill a supernatural painter, who wipes out a generation of people with a few strokes of her brush each year. It is surreal, exciting, melodramatic, sometimes self-indulgent, and strangely hopeful – a breath of fresh air even in a genre that’s hardly starved of stylish, thematically ambitious games.\n\nHexecutable, PC \n\n A satirical slice-of-life game about life as a dieting-obsessed teen in the 00s, Consume Me is extremely funny and has a point to make. Juggling studies with social time and walking the dog, Tetris-ing food on to your plate and and enduring excruciating conversations with your parents, all makes you properly relive the overwhelm and pressure of adolescent life. The presentation, meanwhile, is exuberantly, lovably absurd.\n\nNintendo, Switch 2\n\n The showcase title for the Switch 2 is another glorious addition to the Mario Kart universe, boasting a delightful cast of characters and 30 varied circuits joined by a network of highways that provide the chance to explore a wide open landscape for the first time in the series. Add in the wonderful soundtrack of electronic lounge jazz pop bangers and you have another family gaming staple that will remain on rotation for years.\n\nSpooky Doorway/Raw Fury, PC\n\n It’s the late 19th century and you’ve just arrived at a remote hotel in the west of Ireland to investigate the disappearance of a young woman. But as you dig for clues, the dead emerge from their graves – and they’re really not happy. Part Agatha Christie detective sim, part folk-horror opus, this is a fascinating and engrossing experience that has things to say about class, belief and colonialism.\n\nNeoBards/Konami, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n In 1960s Japan, a young girl’s fury at her bullying father becomes a spectral nightmare that consumes a whole town. Written by acclaimed visual novel author Ryukishi07, the game puts you in familiar Silent Hill territory, which means foggy streets, fiendish puzzles and truly horrible monsters. But by infusing the uncanny, mythology and superstition with feminist themes, it is an intriguing slant on a much loved (and feared) series.\n\nTeam Cherry, PC, PS4/5, Switch, Switch 2, Xbox\n\n Even the most tenacious player will feel like giving up at some point while trapped in Pharloom, a decaying realm full of desperate little bugs that was once a gleaming religious capital. Here lie some truly wretched places: former farms now fetid swamps, dank underground caverns overgrown with moss and misery, grand halls now dust-covered and reverberating with foreboding. And of course there are the guardians of these places, from mind-rotted beast-tamers to corrupted pilgrims and bug-automatons, silk-poisoned creatures and the realm’s former rulers, who stand in the way of your progress. Silksong’s most forbidding foes take hours to overcome. Its worst places will entrap you in despair. But it is worth it, because of the awe-inspiring moments that you will experience along the way: the hard-won victories, those first steps into previously locked-off realms, the secret revelations that seem so personal it’s hard to believe that any of the game’s millions of other players could discover them the same way. An extraordinary game whose sometimes extreme difficulty is both a strength and a weakness.\n\nDogubomb/Raw Fury, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n A young man inherits a mysterious mansion from his uncle: a sprawling pile whose layout changes every day. He needs only to find the secret 46th room, and the place is his for ever. The mansion turns out to be an education: on the personal history of the family that owned it, the mysterious forces that shaped it and the political climate of the wider world in which it is situated. But before you get anywhere near Blue Prince’s deeper mysteries, you must master its blueprints. Behind every door is a choice: do you draft a library? A hallway with several exits? A security room, a laboratory, a pool, a bedroom, a nursery, a drawing room? Each will have its own secrets to discover, a useful item or a key or a new piece of information that gets you ever closer to that elusive 46th room. And each might offer you a new path to the rest of the mansion, or locked doors that you haven’t the means to pass. Every day, with every new route that you carve through these rooms, every dead end you meet, your knowledge accumulates. By the time you do reach that final destination, you’ll have so many unanswered questions, you won’t be able to resist continuing. Blue Prince turns out to be an almost bottomless mystery, leaving you with pads full of notes, theories, numbers and names, lines from books that you want to remember and drawings of strange mechanisms. It is among the best puzzle games ever made: atmospheric and understated and unforgettably clever; still somehow able to show you something new even after tens of hours of patient exploration.",

    "fullText": "PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) – Clackamas County is facing a triple threat Thursday night as flood warnings impact at least three different rivers and major creeks.\n\nMolalla officials say the city could soon find itself cut off if those rivers — Clackamas River, Pudding River, and Johnson Creek — rise any higher.\n\nLIVE Updates: Atmospheric river hits Oregon, SW Washington, bringing intense rain, wind\n\nThe National Weather Service predicts that Johnson Creek will rise above flood stage at Sycamore Thursday afternoon, and the Clackamas River near Estacada is expected to reach major flood stage later in the night.\n\nBut for the city, impacts are already stacking up.\n\nUtility crews have been working along Hwy 213 between Molalla and Oregon City, repairing downed power lines after trees toppled in strong winds.\n\nPortland General Electric has reported widespread outages across Clackamas County with some residents going into day two without power. Conditions have prompted the Molalla River School District to cancel class Thursday as city officials call on residents to prepare for this next round of water.\n\n“If the Molalla River and some of those other rivers actually do reach flood stage, we kind of become isolated,” Molalla City Manager Dan Huff said. “So we become this island that is surrounded by water, and you can’t get out.”\n\nFor families who got in, Preschool For All changed everything\n\nHuff said crews are closely monitoring water intake and wastewater systems, which can quickly clog with debris in fast-moving water.\n\nThe Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office is urging people to avoid flooded roads, stay clear of downed power lines, never drive through standing water, and treat dark traffic signals as four-way stops.\n\nMeanwhile, in Southwest Beaverton, neighbors told KOIN 6 News they’ve seen the consequences of people trying to drive through roads with standing water.\n\n“Two days ago, somebody got stuck coming through and they tried to make it, and there was an electric car and they had to tow it away. So it’s not very, not very wise to go through something you can’t see,” said Mike Bailey. “There’s a ditch on both sides and I’ve seen people come around. They don’t know that there’s a ditch there and they just flop right into it. So we pulled pulled a couple people out of there.”\n\nIn Detroit, Oregon, Marion County officials are warning people to be aware of crews that might be parked on the side of the road amid the heavy rain and low visibility. Crews are currently responding to hundreds of trees that came down in the area.\n\nOfficials say this round of heavy rain is raising red flags. With no snowpack to slow it down, all that water is heading straight into local rivers.\n\nStay with KOIN 6 News as this story develops.",

    "fullText": "Perth is entering a new phase of a battle it never wanted to fight: protecting its tree canopy from a beetle no bigger than a sesame seed. After years of rapid spread and thousands of dead trees, officials are shifting from trying to wipe out the polyphagous shot-hole borer to figuring out how to live with it, 7News reported.\n\nWestern Australia has redrawn its quarantine map for the entire Perth metropolitan area, marking a major shift from the state's earlier, more aggressive attempts to eliminate the polyphagous shot-hole borer. The insect, first found in Fremantle in 2021, has carved through thousands of trees and forced removals in Hyde Park and Kings Park. With no effective chemical treatments and persistent challenges identifying early infestations, the state formally ended its push for eradication in June.\n\nIt was a pivot that alarmed experts. The Invasive Species Council warned the decision \"could put the rest of the country at risk.\"\n\nUnder the new plan, Perth is now split into two zones: an inner management zone where the borer is firmly established and an outer containment zone where officials hope to stop it from spreading further. The Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development will prioritize pruning and removals in the containment area to keep the beetle from reaching regional communities and agricultural corridors.\n\nInvasive species disrupt ecosystems by outcompeting native plants and animals and weakening the landscapes they've long supported. Once this beetle tunnels into a tree, it introduces a fungus that blocks the transport of water and nutrients, slowly starving the tree until it dies. Losing canopy cover affects everything from neighborhood heat levels to wildlife habitat to food-growing conditions.\n\n\"Early detection and management of high-risk infestations, particularly in the containment zone, remain critical to managing the spread and impact,\" DPIRD's Mia Carbon told 7News.\n\nSince native species often have no natural defenses against invaders, delays can give pests a massive advantage. That imbalance threatens biodiversity as well as soil and water health, and it increases the risk of future pest-borne diseases.\n\nDPIRD is working directly with affected property owners, giving them the option of pruning or removing for free trees that were selected during the eradication phase. They may also choose to manage their trees independently with department guidance. The state has committed 4.7 million Australian dollars to local governments in impacted areas and for research into treatment options.\n\nResidents can support containment by reporting suspicious tree damage, avoiding moving untreated wood, and choosing native plants to strengthen local ecosystems.\n\n\"By working together, we will have the best chance of limiting the spread of the borer and minimising its impact on our tree canopy and valuable horticulture industries,\" Carbon said.\n\nDo you feel like the air quality is safe where you live?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

A typical interceptor drone flies with four motor-powered propellers, but unlike the usual quadcopters, it is often shaped like a bullet or a rocket.\n\nInitially built to destroy high-flying reconnaissance craft, they've since been evolved by Ukrainians to take down long-range attack drones at a low cost — primarily as a response to Russia launching large waves of Iranian-designed Shaheds this year.\n\n\"These systems strengthen protection against drone terror while preserving resources for intercepting cruise and ballistic missiles,\" Ukraine's defense minister, Denys Shmyhal, said in Thursday's announcement.\n\nThe defense ministry also said it's been working with more than 10 interceptor manufacturers and has placed more orders for next year.\n\nFor Ukraine, interceptors must be fast enough to chase down drones such as the Shahed-136, which flies at a typical speed of 115 mph, while remaining cheap so that Kyiv's troops can sustainably use hundreds of them a day. Russia has recently been attacking with roughly 5,500 Shahed-type drones a month.\n\nSome Ukrainian drone makers have also been attempting to develop interceptors that can catch the Geran-3, the Russian version of the jet-powered Shahed-238, which can reportedly fly at an estimated 230 mph.\n\nUkraine's new production capacity comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in November that his country was producing roughly 600 to 800 interceptors a day, falling short of his initial goal.\n\nIn July, Zelenskyy had set a production target of 1,000 interceptors a day.\n\nUkraine's volunteer movements directly sponsor some interceptor drones for select military units, though their quantity is often limited compared to the scale of what the Ukrainian government provides.\n\nFor example, deliveries of the Wild Hornets' Sting, a $2,500 interceptor, were mostly sponsored this year by the Sternenko Foundation, a local crowdfunding organization.",

And then when he passed, she was the one person to pick up all the broken pieces and to say, 'I'm going to make sure everything that he lived for continues on,'\" Irwin said.\n\nIrwin was only 2 years old when his father died in 2006, after a stingray barb pierced his chest while he was filming a documentary at the Great Barrier Reef.\n\n\"I feel like my mom showed us the power of unity. When you lose someone very close to you, it really reveals the people around you,\" Irwin said, adding that while some people react really well to loss, others don't as much.\n\n\"We just felt like our tight-knit little family, the three of us — my mom, my sister, and I — we just became this little bubble of love,\" Irwin said.\n\nAt Queensland's Australia Zoo, which his family manages, Irwin says they still feed the same crocodiles his dad once did.\n\n\"I feel the closest to my dad when I'm in there with his crocodiles, and I'm feeding them,\" Irwin added.\n\nDuring the DWTS episode in which he dedicated his performance to his mom, Irwin said that as he grew older, he realized just how hard things must have been for her.\n\n\"I've never been able to capture the feeling of gratitude that I feel for her. At every milestone, I just wished that my dad was there. She was there, and that was enough,\" Irwin said.\n\nIn a September interview with People, Irwin said he feels closer to his late father than ever, partly because there's so much footage of him from his television show, \"The Crocodile Hunter,\" which aired from 1997 to 2004.\n\n\"I'll often come across archive footage that I haven't seen before,\" Irwin said. \"And all of a sudden, his memory just starts flooding back. So it's weird that decades later, after losing someone when I was 2 years old, I almost have an even greater picture of the person he was.\"",

    "description": "Sam Altman said OpenAI has entered \"code red\" mode multiple times to respond to competitive AI threats — and they'll do it again.",
    "fullText": "\"Code red\" isn't a one-off at OpenAI.\n\nCEO Sam Altman said on an episode of the \"Big Technology Podcast\" published Thursday that the company has entered emergency mode multiple times in response to competitive threats — and expects to continue doing so as rivals close in.\n\n\"It's good to be paranoid and act quickly when a potential competitive threat emerges,\" Altman said.\n\n\"My guess is we'll be doing these once maybe twice a year for a long time, and that's part of really just making sure that we win in our space,\" he added.\n\nAltman said that OpenAI had gone \"code red\" earlier this year when China's DeepSeek emerged. DeepSeek shocked the tech industry in January when it said its AI model matches top competitors like ChatGPT's o1 at a fraction of the cost.\n\nOpenAI entered \"code red\" earlier this month, about two weeks after Google released its latest AI chatbot, Gemini 3. The model drew widespread praise after its release in November, with Google touting it as its most advanced model to date. Altman reportedly told staff in an internal Slack memo that OpenAI would prioritize ChatGPT while pushing back other product plans.\n\nAltman said in the podcast episode that Google's Gemini 3 did not have \"the impact we were worried it might.\"\n\n\"But it did — in the same way that Deepseek did — identify some weaknesses in our product offering strategy, and we're addressing those very quickly,\" he added.\n\nSince OpenAI entered \"code red,\" the company has moved quickly to ship new upgrades and features.\n\nLast week, it rolled out a more advanced AI model aimed at improving ChatGPT's performance across professional work, coding, and scientific tasks. OpenAI also unveiled a new image-generation model earlier this week.\n\nAltman said the company will not be in code red \"that much longer.\"\n\n\"Historically, these have been kind of like six- or eight-week things for us,\" he added.\n\nThe state of \"code red\" has also been a precedent for other tech companies. In 2022, Google declared an internal \"code red\" after ChatGPT's debut. The search giant was lagging in consumer AI, despite having funded much of the research that made the AI boom possible.",

    "description": "Love it or loathe it, there’s no escaping it — Jake Paul vs. Anthony Joshua is Friday night in Miami.",
    "fullText": "This weekend of action needs no introduction.\n\nLove it or loathe it, there’s no escaping it — Jake Paul vs. Anthony Joshua is Friday night in Miami, and the noise around it has been impossible to ignore.\n\nAfter five years of boxing in relatively controlled environments, Paul finally steps into a bout that offers no safety net, no asterisks and no soft landing. This is his chance to silence the skeptics and show that he belongs in the sport as more than just a novelty act chasing headlines.\n\nFor Joshua, the responsibility — and the opportunity — sits squarely in his fists. One emphatic statement against the YouTuber-turned-boxer would not only bring the Paul experiment to a crashing halt, but also send “AJ” into 2026 with momentum, relevance and the attention of a U.S. audience suddenly invested in the next chapter of his career.\n\nBut that’s not all that’s happening …\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the five biggest things to look out for this weekend in the world of boxing:\n\nIt feels less like a question of \"if\" and more of a matter of when Paul will get flattened Friday night — and that view isn’t rooted in any lack of respect.\n\nI’ve long since run out of ways to dress up how brave Paul is for taking this fight, but bravery has a habit of bleeding into recklessness when the gap is this vast. There’s a thin line between the two, and Paul is straddling it.\n\nJoshua is levels above him in every conceivable department, several rungs higher on every ladder you care to climb. I don’t doubt for a second that AJ stops Paul on Friday, but there’s just enough curiosity in the chaos to make it unmissable as a spectacle.\n\nStrip it back and it’s boxing in its rawest form. “Step right up, place your bets, and see how long the smaller novice can survive with a seasoned professional before getting knocked out.”\n\nAfter a brief spell of sizing his man up, it will last precisely as long as Joshua decides it should — and you can take that to the bank.\n\nThere’s every chance this is just another colossal marketing exercise from Jake Paul — albeit one that could come with a very real physical cost.\n\nEven if Paul ends the night face down and unconscious, he still gets to walk away claiming he had the nerve to share a ring with an athlete as big, powerful and proven as Anthony Joshua.\n\nThe sheer number of eyes that will land on this Netflix card only drags Most Valuable Promotions further into the mainstream, and the inevitable memes that follow will do nothing but extend Paul’s reach globally in a sport he appears genuinely invested in.\n\nAnd it’s worth remembering: He’s rebuilt before. After losing to Tommy Fury in 2023, he somehow found himself back in the spotlight mixing it up with — checks notes — Mike Tyson.\n\nWins don’t always end with your hand raised, and Paul might just be playing the long game.\n\nJust over a week ago, WBC lightweight champion Caroline Dubois was still in kind of a career limbo.\n\nThe 24-year-old had turned down two offers from Most Valuable Promotions in an attempt to lure her away from Boxxer and had nothing lineup up in terms of action.\n\nBut a week in boxing can change a lot. Finally agreeing to terms on the third offer — joining a host of female talent, including world champions Ellie Scotney and Alycia Baumgardner — and Dubois is now an MVP fighter, and even better, has been thrown onto the undercard in Miami on Friday night.\n\nDubois defends her WBC title at 135 pounds against Italy’s Camilla Panatta in what is expected to be a routine victory, before moving into a busy 2026 where the hit list is plentiful for “Sweet” Caroline.\n\nDubois has grown rapidly in ability and confidence over the past 18 months, and she’s targeting Baumgardner and fellow Brit Terri Harper next year in an attempt to follow in her big brother’s successful footsteps of headlining major cards.\n\nAfter making his return to the ring in August following a 26-year absence, Ike “The President” Ibeabuchi is back (again) on Christmas Eve (obviously) fighting 45-year-old Kabiru Towolawi.\n\nHeadlining a fight card called “Redemption” in Lagos, Nigeria, Ibeabuchi continues his quest to become world heavyweight champion at 52.\n\nThe card will be streamed on prizefighting.tv, and there is a heavy lean on the narrative that Ibeabuchi is en route to bigger and better things in the sport, specifically breaking then-45-year-old George Foreman's record as the oldest heavyweight champion.\n\nIf delusion is your cup of tea, then check out the press release championing Ibeabuchi’s second coming:\n\n“If Ike can dismantle a tough, active opponent like Kabiru, the comeback is no longer a 'story' — it is a reality. The fact that he has maintained his physique and his focus for nearly three decades should strike fear into the hearts of current champions. He isn't just fighting for a paycheck; he is fighting for a miracle.”\n\nSpeaking of Africa, Matchroom is in Ghana on Saturday night to promote itrs first show on the African continent.\n\nBritish light heavyweights Craig Richards and Dan Azeez headline a bill inside Accra's Legon Sports Stadium in a real crossroads fight between two extremely likable fighters.\n\nA loss for either Richards (35) or Azeez (36) would surely push him close to the exit door of a sport that has provided them both with the esteemed British title and numerous nights of domestic barnburners.\n\nBut for the winner? A big night in the opposite corner to rising Ben Whittaker could be the prize on offer.",

    "fullText": "After two major wins this year, GUNTHER now has the unique distinction of retiring John Cena and Goldberg, both of whom are considered legends within WWE. Outside of their high-profile status in WWE, though, \"The Ring General\" indicates that Cena and Goldberg vastly differ. During a new interview with TMZ's \"Inside The Ring,\" he explained how.\n\n\"Very different situation I think because Goldberg was also way more limited than John was. John was just a better wrestler over all his whole career. It's not like it dig to Goldberg. He didn't get famous by putting on in-ring master classes. That was never his thing, so it was a very different situation,\" GUNTHER said when asked to contrast his encounters with Cena and Goldberg.\n\n\"Also the magnitude of it. Obviously, Goldberg is a big name, but it's not comparable to what John Cena represents or the following he has, what he carries with him, and the connection that people have to him. It was hard to compare.\"\n\nGUNTHER's faceoff with Goldberg came at WWE Saturday Night's Main Event on July 12, which ended with the latter passing out to the former's sleeper hold. At SNME on December 13, GUNTHER again emerged victorious with his sleeper hold, this time by making Cena, a conduit of perseverance, tap out.\n\nFollowing their retirement matches, Goldberg and Cena have officially hung up their wrestling boots, or sneakers in Cena's case, at the ages of 58 and 48, respectively. Cena remains a part of the WWE family through his role as an ambassador.\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"Inside The Ring\" with a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "No matter what happens this weekend, Mainz will spend the winter break at the bottom of the Bundesliga table. Despite that hard fact, the Rheinhessen will at least have European football to offer their fans in the coming 2026 calendar year. Heading into the Bundesliga’s 15th matchday, Mainz have still only won one solitary league fixture. In Europe, they’ve been a different beast.\n\nThursday night’s 2-0 home win over Samsunspor gave Mainz four wins in the Conference League this autumn. With the 2025/26 UEFA Europa Conference League group phase now complete, Mainz have finished 7th place in the table and will not have to contest the February playoff round. Come March, the Palatinate club will compete in the Round-of-16 phase of the competition.\n\nOnce again, the team was able to deliver its  fans a magical European evening.\n\nAfter the full time whistle, newly appointed FSV head coach Urs Fischer spoke of a “trying match that featured lots of suffering” when speaking to German broadcaster RTL. Mainz’s de-facto leader on the pitch – tapped by Fischer to serve up higher than usual in the No. 10 slot – didn’t exactly feel the same way. Nadiem Amiri led the FSV cheers in his usual trademark fashion.\n\n“It was very important for me to come out and perform like this again today,” Amiri told RTL. “To finally feel fit and free. It’s a huge step for the club and for us [as a team] a small set in the right direction.“\n\nAmiri’s sunk the crucial 2-0 from the penalty spot shortly after the restart. The latest conversion makes it seven straight penalties for the club’s designated taker. The 29-year-old’s interviewer naturally wished to know if he modeled himself after Bundesliga record breaker Harry Kane.\n\n“Harry Kane is on a totally different level than me,” Amiri answered. “But he’s definitely a role model from whom I learn. I think I’m good at taking penalties, but I have to keep it up.“\n\n“I think today was by far our best performance of the season,” Amiri assured his interviewer. “We were organized on the ball and against the ball. sensational. We can build on this performance.“",

    "title": "Kyle Whittingham on why now was the right time to step down and his post-Utah future",
    "description": "In first interview with the media since stepping down as Utah’s head coach, Whittingham spoke about his decision and what the future holds",
    "fullText": "In his first interview with the media since stepping down as Utah’s head coach last Friday, Kyle Whittingham addressed why now was the right time for him to walk away from the program he’s been in charge of for the past 21 seasons.\n\n“Well, the program’s in a good place right now,” he said after practice Thursday. “As I’ve said many times after last season, it just didn’t sit right with anybody, particularly me, and so came back and fortunately we were able to get the ship righted and everything’s on track.\n\n“Program, like I said, is in a good spot. Got good coaches, coach (Morgan) Scalley will come in and do a great job, got good players, so now is the time.”\n\nWhittingham will coach his final game for Utah in the Dec. 31 Las Vegas Bowl vs. Nebraska.\n\n“This team has been one of my favorite years. The team attitude, the leadership, the work ethic, just the personality and the feel, the vibe of the team is outstanding and having the chance to be around these guys one more month and go to battle one more time with them is something I wanted to do,” Whittingham said.\n\nThe future for Whittingham after he finishes his 266th game as head coach of the Utes is still up in the air. The language used in last Friday’s announcement was “stepping down,” not “retiring,” and moments after the decision was announced, multiple national reporters, including The Athletic’s Stewart Mandel, reported that Whittingham could pursue other coaching opportunities.\n\n“Whittingham, 66, is not retiring, according to a source close to the coach, and may pursue other coaching opportunities,” Mandel wrote on X.\n\nPer’s Whittingham’s latest contract with Utah, he would serve as a “Special Assistant to the Athletics Director” for two years following retirement. That position would pay him $3.45 million per year and Whittingham would not be required to provide more than 10 hours of consulting in a week.\n\nBut is Whittingham’s desire to coach “out of his system” and is he ready to step away from the sidelines completely?\n\n“I don’t know if it’s ever out of your system. I mean it’s in your blood and so I don’t know about that,” he said. “That being said, I’m not sure what I’m going to do, but when you got the coaching in your blood, it just doesn’t go away.”\n\nAsked if this was not a retirement, Whittingham responded, “Who knows? We’ll see. I’m just stepping down and step away and reevaluate things.”\n\nAs for what the process of deciding whether to pursue other opportunities or move into his special assistant role at Utah looks like, it’s pretty simple for Whittingham.\n\n“If my phone rings, I answer it, I like who’s calling? Then we’ll see. Yeah, that’s pretty much the process,” Whittingham said.\n\nUltimately, Whittingham’s decision to step down seemed to come down to his feeling that now was the right time to transition the program over to Scalley.\n\nAdditionally, Whittingham said multiple times on Thursday that he didn’t want to “overstay his welcome” after 21 years in charge of the program.\n\n“I’m a free agent. I’m in the transfer portal,” Whittingham said to laughs. “So yeah, it’s a different feel, but like I said, I’m at peace and I did not want to be that guy that overstayed his welcome and people just saying, ‘Hey, when’s this guy going to leave?’\n\n“That was not my intention ever and I hope I didn’t do that. I’m sure with some people I did do that, but to me the timing is right.”\n\nIt’s still Whittingham’s team until after the Las Vegas Bowl. Aside from the players who have entered the transfer portal, Whittingham said Thursday that Utah has just three opt-outs so far for the New Year’s Eve bowl game — offensive tackle Spencer Fano, offensive tackle Caleb Lomu and defensive end Logan Fano, all of whom have declared for the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nOther than that, Whittingham is expecting everyone, including quarterback Devon Dampier, to play in the Las Vegas Bowl.\n\n“As far as not playing in the game, I think that what we have right now is what we’re going to the game with. I hope so,” Whittingham said.\n\nUtah, favored by 16.5 points against a Nebraska team that will be missing its starting quarterback and running back, has plenty of motivation to send Whittingham out with his 178th win at Utah.\n\n“It means a lot to me. … That’s a coach that believed in me to come in here after being at New Mexico and just had full trust in me and the offense to do what we do and that’s just huge respect from him and just what he’s done for this program,” Dampier said.\n\n“I got to finish well for him.”\n\nWhile Whittingham’s post-Utah future is still unclear as of this week, the program’s future is Scalley, who was announced as Utah’s next head coach last Saturday.\n\nWhittingham gave his full endorsement to Scalley, who played at Utah and coached for nearly two decades under Whittingham and now will lead the Utes starting in the 2026 season.\n\n“He’s organized. He’s really good with Xs and Os. He’s really good at connecting with players. His culture ideas, my culture ideas align perfectly. We both have a lot of the same recruiting strategies and thoughts, evaluation-wise, how you navigate the portal, all that stuff,” Whittingham said.\n\n“It’s very consistent and I think that there’s going to be far more similarities than change. Now he’ll put his own stamp on the program and make no mistake, but way back when I took over for Urban (Meyer) if it’s not broke, don’t fix it. We hung on to a lot of the stuff that Urban did here, but (Scalley) has been here a lot of years. He’s a Utah Man through and through, and so I think it’s going to be a good situation.”\n\nScalley is in the process of building his staff right now and he will be introduced as Utah’s head coach in a press conference on Jan. 6.",

    "description": "Targeting value in Week 16 NFL betting? We break down three plus-money predictions worth backing, with matchup analysis, betting angles, and odds insight.",
    "fullText": "Plus-money props are where opportunity meets context, and this week offers plenty of both.\n\nA rookie quarterback heading on the road is being undervalued by the market, while two proven veterans are playing with real money on the line as contract incentives come into focus.\n\nMotivation, matchup, and usage all align to create outsized NFL picks at longer odds.\n\nSince returning to the lineup, J.J. McCarthy looks rejuvenated, throwing five touchdown passes against vulnerable Washington and Dallas defenses. The Giants profile similarly when it comes to stopping offenses near the goal line, making this another spot where efficiency should show up on the scoreboard.\n\nNew York ranks bottom five in red-zone defense and is riding an eight-game losing skid, allowing 31.5 points per game. This is a defense that struggles to stop drives, and the Minnesota Vikings are well-positioned to take advantage. McCarthy has also shown he’s not afraid to push the ball downfield, ranking second in air yards per attempt while benefiting from the second-best protection rate in the league at 88 percent.\n\nMinnesota’s red-zone tendencies further support the Over. The Vikings have been ineffective running the ball near the goal line to the point that C.J. Ham handled the short-yardage touchdown last week. As a result, Minnesota ranks among the most pass-heavy teams in the red zone. All signs point toward McCarthy clearing 1.5 passing touchdowns.\n\nStefon Diggs has incentive money firmly in play with three games remaining. He’s three receptions shy of a $500K bonus, and 13 catches away from another $500K, putting a total of $1 million on the line. Diggs has recorded at least three receptions in all but one game this season, but has been quieter recently in a pair of run-heavy matchups against the Bills and Giants.\n\nThat could change this week against Baltimore, a defense allowing the sixth-most receptions to wide receivers. If Diggs wants to make a real push toward that second incentive at 80 catches, the volume needs to start building now. With the Jets up next and a Week 18 matchup against Miami that could turn run-heavy if playoff positioning is settled, this sets up as a spot where Diggs is motivated, and the matchup finally cooperates.\n\nFollow me here, because this angle makes sense. Nick Folk has been one of the most reliable kickers in the league, converting 96.2 percent of his attempts, the best mark in the NFL. This also happens to be his final indoor game of the season before trips to the Meadowlands and Orchard Park in Weeks 17 and 18, where kicking conditions become far less predictable.\n\nFolk sits at 25 made field goals and has significant incentives in play, earning $375K at 27 makes and another $500K if he reaches 30. He kicks for an offense that struggles to finish drives and draws another favorable matchup against the Saints this week. Indoors, the leash is longer, and there’s a real chance the coaching staff is more aggressive with long attempts than they’d consider outdoors. Folk has missed just one kick all season and is 7-for-8 from 50-plus, which could turn a few borderline decisions into field goal tries with real incentive-driven upside.\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "fullText": "Joe Buck will be part of ESPN’s first game lineup to call the Los Angeles Dodgers vs. New York Mets game on April 15, as he announced on SI Media with Jimmy Traina. This marks Buck’s second consecutive year being part of ESPN’s first broadcast.\n\nDespite ESPN and Major League Baseball reaching a deal to air 30 regular-season games, Buck is only scheduled to call the Dodgers-Mets game. Last season marked the first time Buck called a nationally broadcasted baseball game since 2021, after leaving Fox for ESPN.\n\nIn 2022, Buck and Troy Aikman signed a multiyear deal with ESPN to become the voices of Monday Night Football. Despite shifting his focus mostly to the NFL, Buck returned for an MLB game alongside Chip Caray in the St. Louis Cardinals' booth in 2024.\n\nBuck and Caray also have fathers who were sports broadcasters. Joe Buck worked alongside his father, Jack, as a Cardinals radio and television broadcaster from 1991 to 2007.\n\nHe also called the PGA Tournament and hosted an alternate broadcast in 2022. The 56-year-old broadcaster prefers calling baseball games earlier in the season because he feels more prepared.\n\n“For someone who hasn’t been involved in the game for four years, and I did Opening Day last year, I think it’s easier to launch off the beginning of the season because it’s not looking back,” Buck told Traina.\n\nBuck also believes calling a game featuring the back-to-back World Series champions will make his job easier.\n\n“It’s a Dodger game, I think it’s Dodger-Mets so, there’s a lot to talk about. I mean, I could probably do it right now. The Dodgers, half their lineup’s going to end up in the Hall of Fame. They’re easy names.”\n\nWhile Buck didn’t officially rule out calling a game later in the season or during the playoffs, he acknowledged it would be much more challenging.\n\n“I’m not prepared to do that without putting myself in solitary confinement for a month and trying to catch up with everything that’s gone on,” Buck said.\n\nBefore Buck’s four-year absence from baseball, he was one of the most recognizable voices in the sport. He served as Fox’s lead play-by-play announcer from 1996 to 2021. During that time, Buck called 23 World Series and 21 All-Star Games, the most by any play-by-play announcer on network television.\n\nBuck will receive the 2026 Ford C. Frick Award, which is presented annually to a broadcaster for major contributions to baseball. Buck and his father will become the first father-son duo to receive the award.",

    "fullText": "The Detroit Tigers continued to add pitching depth to the organization, signing right-hander Inohan Paniagua and left-hander Enmanuel De Jesus to minor league contracts, re-signing left-handers Sean Guenther and Carlos Peña, and extending a non-roster invitation to De Jesus for spring training.\n\nPaniagua, 23, is a power right-hander who bolsters Detroit’s lower-level pitching depth. Signed out of the Dominican Republic, he has spent much of his professional career developing as a starter. His fastball reaches the mid-90s, and the Tigers will continue to evaluate his secondary offerings as they determine whether his future is best suited for the rotation or a relief role as he advances through the system.\n\nDe Jesus, 27, adds experienced left-handed depth and versatility. The Venezuelan native has pitched at the Triple-A level and has worked both as a starter and reliever, giving Detroit a flexible option capable of covering multiple innings. While he has yet to establish himself at the major league level, De Jesus has shown an ability to generate swings and misses and will get an extended look in big league camp as a non-roster invitee.\n\nGuenther, 28, returns on a minor league deal after spending last season in the Tigers’ system. A former Rule 5 pick by Miami, Guenther has big league experience and has primarily worked out of the bullpen. He relies on a fastball-slider combination and provides additional left-handed relief depth at the upper levels of the organization.\n\nPeña also returns to the Tigers after previously pitching in the system. The left-hander adds further organizational depth and familiarity with Detroit’s player development staff. While he is expected to open the season in the minors, Peña gives the Tigers another experienced arm as they build out their pitching inventory.\n\nThe moves underscore Detroit’s emphasis on pitching depth across all levels of the organization. None of the signings are expected to immediately impact the major league roster, but they provide the Tigers with added flexibility entering spring training and the 2026 season.\n\nFollow me on \"X\" @rogcastbaseball",

    "description": "The Ravens got Lamar Jackson back on Thursday, but Zay Flowers and Tyler Linderbaum were listed with new injuries.",
    "fullText": "The Baltimore Ravens got star quarterback Lamar Jackson back at practice on Thursday, but three players were listed with new injuries.\n\nJackson has been getting consistent rest on Wednesdays, and a minor illness was even more reason to keep him at home. He returned to practice as a full participant and will likely be off the injury report altogether by the end of the week.\n\nWide receiver Zay Flowers, center Tyler Linderbaum, and John Jenkins were all added to the injury report on Thursday. Flowers has a neck injury, which is always cause for concern, though it did not stop him from practicing in full. Linderbaum was limited by a knee injury, while Jenkins was absent due to an illness.\n\nAbsences from Flowers and Linderbaum would be huge losses for the Ravens offense, especially heading into a matchup with the Patriots’ top-10 defense. Both will be important to monitor on Friday’s injury report.\n\nHere is the Ravens’ full Thursday injury report (* denotes change in status):\n\nLB Jay Higgins (knee, designated to return from injured reserve)\n\nLT Ronnie Stanley (knee/ankle) *\n\nThe Ravens have not yet placed Buchanan on injured reserve. That move should come later in the week; the team may be waiting to see if Higgins is ready to be activated from his own IR stint. The undrafted rookie is in the first week of his 21-day return window and may need some more time to ramp up.\n\nAn absence from Awuzie is a real possibility after two straight missed practices, which would put T.J. Tampa in a bigger role. The second-year cornerback has held up when asked to play this year, though he has only seen extended time in two games.\n\nHarbaugh said that veterans like Stanley, Smith, and presumably Van Noy were dealing with the typical late-season wear-and-tear and needed some extra rest on Wednesday. The returns of all three on Thursday bodes well for their availability this weekend.\n\nBateman is on track to return from his one-game absence, while Keondre Jackson and Okoye are unlikely to miss any time at all.\n\nThe Patriots’ injury report featured upgraded statuses for two players. Defensive tackle Christian Barmore (non-injury related/other) and linebacker Christian Elliss (illness) both returned to practice after missing Wednesday’s session. Cornerbacks Carlton Davis (hip) and Marcus Jones (knee) and linebackers Harold Landry (knee) and Robert Spillane (ankle) all logged their second absences in a row. All four starters could miss Sunday’s matchup in Baltimore, which would be a major boost to an offense that has struggled against elite defenses this year.",

    "fullText": "When the Golden State Warriors return to the court on Thursday night, they will be without a pair of key rotational pieces against the Phoenix Suns. The Warriors will be missing veteran big man Al Horford and guard Pat Spencer on Thursday night in Phoenix.\n\nHorford has been missing time with a sciatica injury. Horford has missed seven of the last eight games, including four straight. Thursday night will be his fifth straight missed game. ESPN's Nick Friedell reports that Horford is still around another week away from returning from to the court as he continues to rehab from his sciatica injury.\n\nHorford said he is feeling better in his rehab — but he thinks he’s probably another week away from returning as he continues to deal with a sciatica issue.\n\n— Nick Friedell (@NickFriedell) December 18, 2025\n\nHorford has played 13 games in his first season for the Warriors, averaging 5.6 points on 32.1% shooting from the field and 29.8% from deep to go along with 4.4 rebounds per contest.\n\nWhile Horford is out on Thursday with his sciatica injury, Spencer is ruled out against the Suns for personal reasons. With Spencer and Horford out, Steve Kerr will have to lean on Golden State's depth, with players like Quinten Post, Brandin Podziemski, De'Anthony Melton and Gary Payton II potentially seeing a bigger role on Thursday night in Phoenix.\n\nThe Warriors will tip off against the Suns at 6 p.m. PT on Thursday night in the desert.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Warriors Wire! \n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Injury Report: Al Horford, Pat Spencer out vs. Suns",

He’s good on the edge. He’s fast. He’s played inside a little bit. He’s played on the edge.”\n\nGainer recorded 27 tackles and 2.5 sacks in his one season at UNC. He finished his college career with 237 total tackles.\n\n“He played inside at Florida State, if I remember, in college,” Maye said. “He moved to the edge once he got to North Carolina. So, I know he was with Vegas, and it’s good to see him back. I think everybody’s just trying to see what they can do just to help us, whether it’s on game day, throughout practice or whatever he can do.”\n\nGainer appeared in 17 games as a rookie with the Las Vegas Raiders, playing mostly in a special teams capacity. The 25-year-old provides good size to the practice squad and a great motor, according to Maye.\n\n“I know he’s going to work hard, and I know he’s got a good work ethic,” Maye said.\n\nMike Vrabel-Bashing Radio Host Shreds Patriots Coach Amid Josh McDaniels Debate",

He had asked for a trade from the team during the offseason and finally got one to Jacksonville at the trade deadline.\n\nThe Jaguars gave up fourth- and sixth-round picks for Meyers and got a reliable receiver. Meyers posted his first career 1,000-receiving yard season last year in Vegas and has followed it up with 707 yards this season, 355 of them in six games with the Jaguars. His tenure in Jacksonville has also coincided with a 5-1 run for the team, which leads the AFC South with a 10-4 record.\n\nA $20 million average annual value places Meyers 25th among current wide receiver contracts via OverTheCap, right behind Tampa Bay Buccaneers star Mike Evans.",

    "fullText": "Tennessee radio personality Jared Stillman has become a notorious critic of New England Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel.\n\nThe Nashville-based host blasted Vrabel earlier this season when he claimed the team’s 8-2 start should be credited to the addition of offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, not the head coaching change.\n\nNow he is back at it, this time claiming Vrabel is “itching” to get rid of McDaniels so that he can hire one of his previous coordinators.\n\n“I know Vrabel-ese, and I know Mike Vrabel,” Stillman said. “I assume that Mike Vrabel is just itching to get Josh McDaniels out of there so that he can hire one of his loser buddies like Todd Downing or Tim Kelly. I can feel it!\n\n“And you can call me a hater or whatever you want to call me, I can just sense it.”\n\nStillman went on to say that the only thing keeping the Patriots from winning a Super Bowl in the near future is Vrabel’s ego.\n\n“The only thing in my opinion that’s going to keep Mike Vrabel, and Drake Maye, and Josh McDaniels, from winning the Super Bowl at some point over the next five years, is Mike Vrabel’s ego,” Stillman said. “And Josh McDaniels is the epitome of the downside of the great Mike Vrabel.”\n\nStillman’s criticism centered on a moment when Vrabel was asked about McDaniels’ success as a play caller, and he answered with praise for the entire coaching staff.\n\nThat is a bad thing in Stillman’s eyes.\n\nThe self-proclaimed hater likened Vrabel’s answer to a moment when he was coaching the Tennessee Titans and was asked about the then-quarterback Wil Levis’ performance. Vrabel once again praised the entire staff, as opposed to just crediting the individual.\n\nWhich, again, apparently is a bad thing.\n\n“Josh McDaniels is a Super Bowl-winning offensive coordinator who got Mac Jones to the Pro Bowl as a rookie,” Stillman said. “And they have the 23-year-old second coming of Aaron Rodgers without the baggage and drama at quarterback. And Vrabel can’t be happy?”\n\nDrake Maye Raves About Former North Carolina Teammate After Patriots Signing",

    "description": "In the suit, McPhee says she was placed on leave to stop her from testifying before a federal grand injury investigating the NFLPA and the Major League Baseball Players Association, according to ESPN's report.",
    "fullText": "Heather McPhee, associate general counsel for the NFL Players Association since 2009, filed a federal lawsuit Thursday, alleging that former executive director Lloyd Howell Jr. and two current top union executives conspired to prevent her from cooperating with a criminal investigation into union finances, as reported by ESPN's Don Van Natta Jr.\n\nMcPhee was placed on paid administrative leave on Aug. 14 after she was the subject of multiple employee complaints, per Van Natta and ESPN's Jeff Passan, that reportedly included accusations of failing to follow supervisors' directions, bullying colleagues and disrupting the union's work environment.\n\nIn the suit, McPhee says she was placed on leave to stop her from testifying before a federal grand injury investigating the NFLPA and the Major League Baseball Players Association, according to ESPN's report.\n\nMonths before she was placed on leave, she made allegations that sparked an FBI investigation into the NFLPA, the MLBPA and OneTeam Partners, their $2 billion licensing company.\n\nMcPhee is reportedly seeking at least $10 million in damages, according to the suit, in which she accuses Howell of illegal misconduct, sex discrimination, breach of fiduciary duty and retaliation, per ESPN.\n\nHowell, who became the NFLPA's executive director in 2022, resigned on July 17. He stepped down after a tumultuous month of criticism that stemmed from Pablo Torre and Mike Florio reporting that the NFL and NFLPA covered up a ruling on a collusion grievance. An arbitrator, Christopher Droney, found that, in the wake of Deshaun Watson signing a fully-guaranteed $230 million contract with the Cleveland Browns ahead of the 2022 season, league executives encouraged team owners to reduce the amount of guaranteed money players received in subsequent contracts.\n\nDroney, though, concluded that he couldn't prove by a \"clear preponderance\" that NFL teams followed suit. Still, the details revealed from that 2022 annual owners' meeting were indelible, and so was the fact that the NFLPA reportedly agreed with the NFL to keep the collusion grievance findings under wraps. That left a stain on Howell's reputation, as did other matters, chief among them his reported spending of union funds for visits to strip clubs.\n\nAfter McPhee initially flagged concerns within the NFLPA in November 2024 regarding senior executives potentially violating labor laws governing conflicts of interest and the fulfillment of fiduciary duties, as reported by ESPN, she alleges that union leaders targeted her \"in order to conceal and deflect their own misconduct and failures.\"\n\nMcPhee questioned the legality of a senior executive incentive plan proposed by OneTeam Partners that would have paid millions of dollars in bonuses to Howell, MLBPA executive director Tony Clark and others, per ESPN, which also reported that McPhee states in the suit that she opposed Howell's decision to keep the collusion grievance findings secret.\n\nThe suit says, according to ESPN, that the union leaders signing a confidentiality agreement with the NFL \"raised concerns about a potential violation of the NFLPA's duty of fair representation to players.\"\n\nWhen union leaders discovered McPhee was in line to testify as a grand jury witness about what she deemed to be criminal misconduct by Howell and others, she alleges she was removed from meetings and cut off from the board and players.\n\nShe was then placed on leave due to her \"workplace behavior.\" McPhee believes that was a tactic to prevent her from cooperating with the DOJ.",

    "description": "Rutgers Wrestling falls against a ranked Oklahoma team, picks up win over Drexel.",
    "fullText": "The Rutgers wrestling team split its weekend matches, falling to then-No. 20 Oklahoma 19-14 but beating unranked Drexel 28-12. Oklahoma’s win saw them jump up into the No.15 spot according to the NWCA Coaches Poll. The Scarlet Knights were ranked at No.12 before moving down to No.19.\n\nDespite the result, Rutgers got off to a really hot start in their dual against Oklahoma. The Knights took home four victories in the first six bouts and built an 11-6 lead heading into the final four. This run was highlighted by a No. 13/9 Dylan Shawver major decision over Carter Schmidt,13-3, and a No. 26/28 Anthony White Major decision over Layton Schneider, 8-0. Unfortunately for the Knights, their run would stop here. Rutgers was beaten in four straight bouts, allowing Oklahoma to secure victory. Both 174-pounder No. 9/4 Lenny Pinto and HWT No.22/19 Hunter Catka fought their opponent tough, but neither could find a way to pull off a victory against their ranked opponents.\n\nFormer Knight and 184-pounder No.11 Brian Soldano found his way back to the banks for this match after becoming a Sooner. He delivered Oklahoma a 9-6 decision over No. 15/18 Shane Cartagena-Walsh.\n\nThe heavier weights for Rutgers, who struggled against Oklahoma, fared much better against Drexel. The Knights finished the duel with five straight wins and seven wins overall. This streak was highlighted by Pinto securing a fall over No.18/13 Jesiah Queen, Cartagena-Walsh securing a major decision over Ethan Wilson, 18/16 197-pounder Remy Cotton securing a major decision over No.31 Ibrahim Ameer, and Catka securing a tech fall over Dom Petracci to cement Rutgers 16 point win.\n\nThe season as a whole started strong for Rutgers. The Knights started 5-0 in the duals, cruising over schools like Centenary, Gardner-Webb, Bloomsburg, Navy, and Davidson. The team also took home first place in the Keystone Classic, where Pinto, 141-pounder Joseph Olivieri, and 125-pounder Ayden Smith brought home individual titles for their weight class. Rutgers would finish the tournament with 159 team points. The next highest was Penn at 140 team points.\n\nHowever, once Rutgers played No.10 NC State and No.20 Oklahoma, they struggled, dropping both duals in tough fashion. Despite their win over unranked Drexel, things will only get harder for the Knights from here, as their next dual is a date with No.1 Penn State in Happy Valley to kick off conference play, one week before No.13 Michigan comes to town. The Big Ten is widely regarded as the best conference in wrestling, so Rutgers will have to step up and win some ranked duals to show that it still deserves to be a ranked program itself.\n\nThe first bout for the Knights in their match at Penn State will be at 4 pm on January 10th.",

    "fullText": "When is Davante Adams coming back? Injury update, return timeline for Rams WR originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams will be without wide receiver Davante Adams for the Week 16 game against the Seattle Seahawks, which will have huge playoff implications.\n\nAdams landed on the injury report once again this week with a hamstring issue. He was on the Week 15 injury report with the hamstring, also, but aggravated the issue and was forced to exit last week's game early.\n\nAdams didn't practice at all this week before drawing the doubtful tag and being ruled out on Thursday night ahead of kickoff.\n\nHere's what we know about his return timeline.\n\nAt this point, Adams should be considered week to week.\n\nAdams' injury isn't a season-ending issue, so he will be back at some point. When that is, remains to be seen.\n\nNFL Network's Ian Rapoport said earlier on Thursday that the hope is Adams could return next week, but that is far from certain.\n\n\"So, don't expect him to play tonight, but the hope is, next game, if there's enough time to recover, we could see Davante out there.\"\n\nBut, earlier in the week, Rapoport floated the possibility that Adams could miss the rest of the regular season with his hamstring injury.\n\n\"There are only a couple types of injuries this time of year: there's an injury where a guy is fine, there's an injury where he's back for the playoffs, and then he's done,\" Rapoport said. \"The hope is that this is one of those he's back for the playoffs.\"\n\nWhat Adams has going for him next week is the Rams will enjoy a mini-bye thanks to their Thursday night game in Week 16, giving him 11 days with Los Angeles playing on Monday night in Week 17.\n\nAnother positive for Adams was his ability to do at least some work in pre-game warm-ups on Thursday night.\n\nWe should get our next update on Adams at the top of next week, but if not it won't come any later than Thursday, when Los Angeles drops its first injury report of the week.\n\nWhy CeeDee Lamb's 2 missed practices aren't a concern for Week 16\n\nQuinn Ewers can end 21-year drought for Texas quarterbacks\n\nBroncos' NFL record could be shattered by Dolphins in 2026\n\nWhat Patrick Mahomes tearing 2 ligaments means for recovery timeline\n\nJaguars offense in midst of streak not seen in NFL this season",

    "fullText": "A little over 24 hours before Texas A&M (11-1, 7-1 SEC) hosts Miami (10-2) in the first round of the College Football Playoff, the Aggie media team, which released a tease of the uniform Texas A&M will wear, maroon jerseys, while an updated video on Thursday night provided a glimpse at the full uniform, which will rival Miami's regular white road look.\n\nAccording to the video, Texas A&M will enter Kyle Field on Saturday wearing maroon helmets, maroon jerseys, and white pants, which is the standard home look. The only exception was the blackout look against Mississippi State earlier this season, which resulted in a 31-9 win over the Bulldogs.\n\nHowever, the Aggies tricked all of us earlier this week after hinting at a potential blackout, which would have been a first for an early 11:00 a.m. kickoff. Still, whatever the Aggies wear isn't going to magically help this team get past the Hurricanes, who will field one of the best defenses in the country, and one of the more electrifying playmakers in freshman wide receiver Malachi Toney.\n\nHead coach Mike Elko is hoping that playing at home three weeks after losing to Texas on the road to end the regular season is the recipe for success, paired with a solid week of practice. The news is that star running back Le'Veon Moss, who has missed the last six games due to an ankle injury, is \"questionable\" to play on Saturday. At the same time, senior linebacker Scooby Williams and safety Bryce Anderson are \"probable\" with 75% chance to take the field.\n\nEither way, Texas A&M's best path to facing Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl is for starting quarterback Marcel Reed to play at an elite level, both in the pocket and with his legs, against a Miami defensive line led by Rueben Bain, who is looking to ruin the Aggies' offensive game plan.\n\nEvery era has led to this. #GigEm | #BTHOmiami pic.twitter.com/3zcz2bRZwp\n\n— Texas A&M Football (@AggieFootball) December 18, 2025\n\nTexas A&M will host Miami on Saturday at 11:00 a.m. with coverage on ABC and ESPN.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M will wear maroon/maroon/white vs. Miami in the CFP",

    "fullText": "it's a privilege to write a piece with this title. so before jumping in, thank you.\n\nbelow is a recap of the incredible year we had at TRMNL. how we got lucky, mistakes made along the way, and what's next.\n\ni live in a small town. when asked what i do for work i reply \"IT.\" last year i joined the local Cattlemen's Association.\n\nneedless to say, TRMNL is fully remote. this year we grew from a few friends hacking on nights and weekends to 25+ across 4 continents, 6 countries, and 3 facilities. the latest one is actually under construction and i'll talk more about it later.\n\nremote has become the standard for software companies, but hardware is a bit trickier. in the future i'd like more face to face environments so we can move faster. in < 90 days we're hosting our first team retreat.\n\nanyway. TRMNL is proud to have dedicated support, operations, marketing, open source, and core engineering members. learn more about each person here.\n\nwe launched on Kickstarter in June 2024 with a single device, the TRMNL OG. i always wanted to legally name something OG and now governments around the globe have our EC licenses filed in their digital coffers.\n\nour firmware runs on ESP32s, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and beyond. you can even run TRMNL in your browser (Chrome, Firefox) or join 1,500+ people using our web app with their own hardware. which by design we have no way of even detecting.\n\nto meet customer demand in 2025 we rebuilt our Framework UI kit, render pipeline, and firmware. perhaps most important, this year we improved our utility with 100s of new plugins. in January 2025 we had ~60, today we have over 700. nearly 90% of publicly listed TRMNL plugins are built and maintained by the TRMNL community.\n\ni should have put this section at the top.\n\nTRMNL exists because most products do not respect the most valuable currency: our attention. most products do not respect privacy. most products stop working when the maker says \"i quit.\" most products cannot be self-repaired. most products need to charge every weekend.\n\nour vision is to help you stay focused in an increasingly distracting world. we do that with ambient technology, as few emails and notifications as possible, and a thoughtful team who cares.\n\nas a rule we don't kiss and tell, but here's what i can share: 10s of 1000s of homes and offices use TRMNL.\n\nwe got here without a single ad on Facebook or Instagram or Ticky Tocky. our \"analytics stack\" is a free dashboard, visible to all. should i lock that down?\n\nthese outcomes let us provide for our families and make TRMNL better every day at $0 additional cost to customers.\n\nif one day we stop getting lucky, we'll open source everything.\n\ni've never run a hardware company. i've never made products for consumers, or used Discord, or written C++. before TRMNL i sold (mostly boring) B2B software.\n\nso this year i learned to depend on a team of specialists who dream and bring ideas to fruition. but we (i) didn't get everything right. here are some of those blunders:\n\nin each case we found a solution, but with more experience we could have avoided spending the Good Will reserves.\n\ni'll posit that a single theme carried us through the mistakes: ownership.\n\nwhen TRMNL screws up we don't hide it. we invite the community to help make it right and we observe Hammurabi's Code. our engineers are available on live chat nearly 24 hours a day. some companies behave otherwise. but TRMNL customers are smart, and smart people have sophisticated BS detectors. as mom always said: do not insult the hand that feeds you.\n\nanother scary endeavor in 2025 was bootstrapping our own logistics network and warehouse tech. TRMNL runs 2 facilities, with a 3rd underway, where all devices are assembled and shipped by our team. call me old fashioned, but it's important that my desk is just a few steps from a packing station.\n\nfinally, we started investing in the community via the Creator Fund. over $20,000 has been distributed in its first 2 months and we couldn't be happier with downstream effects. whether you write code, speak another language, or design 3D models, TRMNL wants to reward you for making a difference.\n\nbeyond the usual suspects of pushing bugs directly to master or waiting 5 months to implement a popular feature request, a few grey swans appeared.\n\nwe mitigated each issue with smart people and debate-driven solutions. some of our tariff bills are still frozen by UPS. every lost shipment or damaged device was replaced at our expense.\n\nand this is kind of the other side of entrepreneurship generally. every team shows up when things are good. the measure of an organization's resolve is whether they keep hacking when things go wrong.\n\nmark my words: more is coming out than has come out.\n\nfrom products to features, enterprise solutions, even better pricing, federating the open source ecosystem, IRL events...\n\na few teasers. i intend to launch our 3rd product in-person, Spring 2026 at our Berlin warehouse. customers in the region will receive a physical invitation in the mail.\n\nwe're grateful for the opportunity you gave us in 2025. it's our turn to give back in 2026. to those who celebrate, Merry Christmas and happy New Year.",

    "description": "Physicist doubts work like Higgs boson identification achievable now as academics are expected to 'keep churning out papers'",
    "fullText": "Peter Higgs, the British physicist who gave his name to the Higgs boson, believes no university would employ him in today's academic system because he would not be considered \"productive\" enough.\n\nThe emeritus professor at Edinburgh University, who says he has never sent an email, browsed the internet or even made a mobile phone call, published fewer than 10 papers after his groundbreaking work, which identified the mechanism by which subatomic material acquires mass, was published in 1964.\n\nHe doubts a similar breakthrough could be achieved in today's academic culture, because of the expectations on academics to collaborate and keep churning out papers. He said: \"It's difficult to imagine how I would ever have enough peace and quiet in the present sort of climate to do what I did in 1964.\"\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian en route to Stockholm to receive the 2013 Nobel prize for science, Higgs, 84, said he would almost certainly have been sacked had he not been nominated for the Nobel in 1980.\n\nEdinburgh University's authorities then took the view, he later learned, that he \"might get a Nobel prize – and if he doesn't we can always get rid of him\".\n\nHiggs said he became \"an embarrassment to the department when they did research assessment exercises\". A message would go around the department saying: \"Please give a list of your recent publications.\" Higgs said: \"I would send back a statement: 'None.' \"\n\nHiggs revealed that his career had also been jeopardised by his disagreements in the 1960s and 70s with the then principal, Michael Swann, who went on to chair the BBC. Higgs objected to Swann's handling of student protests and to the university's shareholdings in South African companies during the apartheid regime. \"[Swann] didn't understand the issues, and denounced the student leaders.\"\n\nHe regrets that the particle he identified in 1964 became known as the \"God particle\".\n\nHe said: \"Some people get confused between the science and the theology. They claim that what happened at Cern proves the existence of God.\"\n\nAn atheist since the age of 10, he fears the nickname \"reinforces confused thinking in the heads of people who are already thinking in a confused way. If they believe that story about creation in seven days, are they being intelligent?\"\n\nHe also revealed that he turned down a knighthood in 1999. \"I'm rather cynical about the way the honours system is used, frankly. A whole lot of the honours system is used for political purposes by the government in power.\"\n\nHe has not yet decided which way he will vote in the referendum on Scottish independence. \"My attitude would depend a little bit on how much progress the lunatic right of the Conservative party makes in trying to get us out of Europe. If the UK were threatening to withdraw from Europe, I would certainly want Scotland to be out of that.\"\n\nHe has never been tempted to buy a television, but was persuaded to watch The Big Bang Theory last year, and said he wasn't impressed.",

    "fullText": "Today, we're announcing that Lovable has raised $330 million in Series B funding at a $6.6 billion valuation, led by CapitalG and Menlo Ventures' Anthology fund.\n\nAdditional investors in this round include the venture arms of leading companies building the future of work: NVentures (NVIDIA’s venture capital arm), Salesforce Ventures, Databricks Ventures, T.Capital (Deutsche Telekom), Atlassian Ventures, and HubSpot Ventures. They’re joined by Khosla Ventures, DST Global, EQT Growth, Kinship Ventures, and returning investors Accel, Creandum, and Evantic, among others.\n\nWe launched Lovable to empower the 99% — the people who've had ideas but lacked the technical skills to bring them to life. Now, we're watching a transformation unfold in real time.\n\nA new category of people has emerged: builders. They're the product manager who wants to show, not just tell. The marketer with projects stuck in engineering backlogs. The ops team using outdated software for internal tooling. The nurse who sees a better way to visualize patient journeys. The artist in need of a website with an e-commerce platform integration—in time for the holidays. The founder turning a side hustle into the main thing.\n\nAnd they're building at a scale we never imagined:\n\nLet’s look at what builders are doing in large enterprises, like Klarna and Deutsche Telekom:\n\nJorge Luthe, Senior Director of Product at Zendesk:\n\nThanks to Lovable’s rapid prototyping and real-time collaboration capabilities, we’ve dramatically streamlined our product development process. What once took six weeks — from idea to working prototype — now takes just three hours. This shift has enabled our product management, UX, and engineering teams to collaborate faster and more effectively than ever before.\n\nShipping real products in production:\n\nDharmin Parikh, Director of Product at Uber AI:\n\nLovable makes it easy for our teams to create interactive prototypes and move from idea to decision with less friction.\n\nJonathan Abrahamson, Chief Product and Digital Officer at Deutsche Telekom:\n\nAI is transforming how enterprises build and validate products. For a 2,000-person product & engineering organization, this goes far beyond faster prototypes. It demands a new approach to how the best ideas come to life. Lovable shares that perspective, and their vision pairs naturally with how we will develop and ship products at Deutsche Telekom.\n\nAnd founders are building new businesses, too:\n\nThis investment accelerates our work in three key areas:\n\nDeeper integrations. Builders don't work in isolation. They use Notion for docs, Linear for tickets, Jira for sprints, Miro for brainstorms. Lovable already connects to these tools, and we're going deeper — so the context you've already built informs what you create next.\n\nEnhanced collaboration and governance. As more teams adopt Lovable, they need the features enterprises expect. We're continuing to invest in making Lovable ready for organizations of every size.\n\nInfrastructure to take products from prototype to production. Lovable isn't just for demos. With built-in hosting, databases, authentication, and payments, people ship real products — not just mockups. We're continuing to build out the capabilities that make this possible.\n\nHere’s why these firms are working with Lovable.\n\nLaela Sturdy, Managing Partner at CapitalG:\n\nLovable has done something rare: built a product that enterprises and founders both love. The demand we're seeing from Fortune 500 companies signals a fundamental shift in how software gets built. We're proud to lead this round and support Lovable's vision of making software creation accessible to everyone.\n\nMatt Murphy, Partner at Menlo Ventures:\n\nLovable is a beloved product for all the right reasons. They've done what was previously unimaginable by turning a latent market of tens of millions of people into web developers and content creators. We love category builders like our previous early investments in Uber and Anthropic—companies that have the opportunity to be enormous. Lovable is showing exactly that trajectory.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow, Co-founder and General Partner at Kinship Ventures:\n\nWhat makes Lovable compelling is how accessible it is to non-technical founders. You don’t need to write code to get started—you need clarity of thought. Imagine that idea scrawled on the back of a napkin can magically turn into a working prototype with a real codebase with just one sentence. That’s what Lovable unlocks for founders. Lovable gives founders a new kind of agency and confidence. And, most importantly, speed. That shift is deeply aligned with how we think about empowerment at Kinship.\n\nThis is the age of the builder. A seismic shift in what's possible. The story belongs to the teachers, product managers, founders, and dreamers who now have the tools to bring their ideas to life. See their stories.",

    "description": "National security shouldn’t ever have a price.",
    "fullText": "President Trump announced last week that he would allow China to buy an advanced artificial intelligence chip, the H200, from the American company Nvidia, doubling down on a misguided decision he made over the summer to sell China another advanced chip, the H20. The H200 is about six times as powerful and will be an even greater boon to China’s military and A.I. development.\n\nMr. Trump explained that in return, the U.S. government will charge a 25 percent fee on all sales of the H200. But U.S. national security and technological dominance shouldn’t ever have a price — let alone such a low one.\n\nFor years, both the Trump and Biden administrations had successfully sought as large a lead as possible over China in A.I. In 2018, the first Trump administration wisely cut off key companies in China from the most advanced chip-making equipment. In 2020, Mr. Trump helped reverse the deployment of nonsecure Chinese 5G telecommunications networks by Britain and other allies by banning the sale of advanced chips to the Chinese tech giant Huawei. The Biden administration substantially expanded those controls and added new ones. Both administrations said that China would use American-made chips to develop more sophisticated A.I. and modernize its military.\n\nHampered by those policies, China has struggled to make advanced A.I. chips, despite a push of around $200 billion starting in 2014. None of China’s chips are close to matching the capacity of the H200. Huawei, a leading Chinese chipmaker, projects that it will not be able to match the H200’s performance until the end of 2027 at the earliest — and even that estimate sounds optimistic.\n\nIn addition to making less capable chips, China struggles to make them in large quantities. Trump administration officials testified in June that China will make just 200,000 chips per year — not even enough for a single data center. By contrast, Taiwan, the United States and the rest of the democratic world will produce more than 10 million far-superior chips per year. All told, China will produce a total computing power that is a mere 1 percent to 3 percent of what U.S. companies will produce.\n\nThe chief executive of DeepSeek, a prominent A.I. company in China, admitted in 2024 that access to chips was the company’s biggest impediment. In the summer of 2025, DeepSeek reportedly tried and failed to train a new system on Chinese chips. When DeepSeek released its latest model several weeks ago, it acknowledged that the system still lags behind U.S. versions and cited computing limitations as the key reason.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump’s announcement last week, Chinese companies jumped at the chance to buy the H200 — more evidence that America’s chip advantage is real.\n\nThe Trump administration argues that selling chips to China will keep China “addicted” to American products and undermine its efforts to improve production. But China knows better. In the days since Mr. Trump announced his decision to sell the H200, there have been reports that China will invest an additional $70 billion to improve its domestic production of chips. According to a report on Sunday in the Global Times, which is controlled by China’s ruling party, Nvidia’s advanced chips would be used only until Chinese tech companies can transition to domestic alternatives.\n\nIt’s all part of the same pattern, whether the product is solar panels, electric vehicles or telecommunications: China imports Western technology until its own production catches up; then it cuts out American companies. President Xi Jinping has long said that relying on others for core technology “is like building a house on someone else’s foundation.”\n\nIt should be obvious that the United States should not sell China advanced technology that China could use to target American troops and intelligence officers. Advanced A.I. will improve China’s cyber operations, intelligence analysis and weaponry. According to reports, the Trump White House has concluded that Alibaba, one of China’s biggest A.I. companies, provides technology support for the Chinese military, including some of its operations against U.S. targets. (Alibaba has denied this claim.) Other reports suggest that DeepSeek evades U.S. export controls and aids Chinese military and intelligence operations. Chinese procurement documents show that the People’s Liberation Army is also trying to get its hands on advanced U.S. chips.\n\nThe bipartisan House committee on China was right when it said last week that China will use the H200 to “strengthen its military capabilities and totalitarian surveillance,” and when it recommended tightening export controls rather than loosening them.\n\nThe Trump administration is well aware of how much A.I. matters to national security, which makes its decision even more baffling. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, last week proclaimed, “The future of American warfare is here, and it’s spelled ‘A.I.’” And when the Department of Justice recently announced charges against two individuals accused of smuggling H200s to China, it underscored the national security issues: “These chips are the building blocks of A.I. superiority and are integral to modern military applications. The country that controls these chips will control A.I. technology; the country that controls A.I. technology will control the future.”\n\nFor now, that country is the United States. In 2017, Li Keqiang, China’s premier at the time, told Mr. Trump during a meeting in Beijing that China would come to dominate all technologies, including A.I., and that America would export little more than soybeans and corn. Last week’s decision helps make that unlikely dream a reality.\n\nBen Buchanan is an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies and an adviser to A.I. and cybersecurity companies. Matt Pottinger is a distinguished visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution and the chief executive of Garnaut Global, a geopolitical research company.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

    "description": "This post will introduce a tutorial on how to build an app for ChatGPT using Apollo Client and Apollo MCP Server. You’ll have what you need to get started with our opinionated stack for building these apps.",
    "fullText": "Building Apps for ChatGPT with Apollo MCP Server and Apollo Client\n\nIn early October, OpenAI introduced the ChatGPT Apps SDK with a handful of launch partners. These “apps” could be invoked by ChatGPT via Model Context Protocol (MCP) and would be embedded directly into the ChatGPT interface. In their intro video, they showed use cases like asking for flights, hotel locations, house listings, and more, including teasing the idea of asking follow up questions to ChatGPT.\n\nImagine your application being part of the conversation, allowing the user to ask follow up questions, and having your app be responsive to those questions. These are action-oriented conversational apps where the LLM can take action on behalf of a user with rich interactive UIs.\n\nThis idea quickly caught fire, and now the MCP apps spec is proposing a standardized approach to create these kinds of experiences, with other AI vendors sure to follow suit. We’re excited about the potential here, and are working on tools to abstract away all of the AI provider details from you with a great developer experience, allowing you to focus on building your app instead of worrying about vendor idiosyncrasies and evolving standards.\n\nWe want this to be a true “build once” solution where you can deploy your app anywhere that supports one of the protocols that we will support. This way, you don’t need to host a separate MCP Server, and build a separate app, for every provider and sub-protocol that emerges.\n\nYou can instead focus on your customers.\n\nThis post will introduce a tutorial on how to build an app for ChatGPT using Apollo Client and Apollo MCP Server. By the end of it, you’ll have what you need to get started with our opinionated stack for building these apps. If you prefer to dive into the template and follow along, you can find the repo here.\n\nBased on the OpenAI documentation and examples, to build one of these apps you would:\n\nWe don’t want you to have to do any of this. You shouldn’t have to focus on any of the inner workings of this sub-protocol, or even think about MCP. Your front-end engineers shouldn’t have a new dependency on your platform engineers. Instead, you should be able to focus on building exciting and compelling experiences for your customers.\n\nInstead of this feeling like learning 100% how to build apps from scratch, this should be 90% reusing what you already know about building apps, and 10% learning about the specifics of this new paradigm.\n\nWe wanted to make this as easy as possible and decided to reach for tools that are already familiar to many of our users: Apollo MCP Server and Apollo Client. If you want to follow along in this tutorial, you can find all the code in our OpenAI Apps SDK demo.\n\nTo build this app we have two components: a React app and Apollo MCP Server. This solution works without any additional MCP Server configuration. The client gets to focus on their application, not the MCP server configuration.\n\nStarting in our main.tsx file, we create an ApolloClient instance and ApolloProvider, very similar to how we would on a traditional React app, but we’re going to import them from @apollo/client-ai-apps instead of the normal location. This is an Apollo Client integration package, similar to @apollo/client-nextjs. This allows us to do a lot of setup and details behind the scenes of dealing with data being exchanged over MCP.\n\nNow we can use the normal useQuery and useMutation hooks as we normally would!\n\nFor example, I can write a component that gets my TOP_PRODUCTS:\n\nLooks pretty normal, but what is that @tool directive on the operation? That is allowing you to declare in your app a tool that will be exposed to the LLM, including a name and description. At the same time, we are registering the operation that will be executed when this tool is called (and therefore the data that should be delivered as part of this tool), and the graphql variables become the input schema for the tool!\n\nThis is really exciting because we’re able to declare so much with so little code. Also, these are on-the-fly tool declarations. I don’t need a platform team to create these tools for me on an MCP server!\n\nAnother important aspect of this solution is showing the right component based on what tool was called by the LLM. It turns out we’ve had this problem solved for years now with React Router!\n\nTo do this, we provide a useToolEffect hook, which works the same way as a useEffect, but allows you to run the effect based on which tool was executed.\n\nUsing this hook, and a very familiar navigate function from react-router, I can express that when the “Top Products” tool is called, I should navigate to the /home view.\n\nThe magic of this solution really comes from a custom Vite plugin called the ApplicationManifestPlugin which extracts all the operations, tools, and metadata from your React app and generates a .application-manifest.json file:\n\nThis plugin runs during dev and build time and generates a file that looks something like this:\n\nWhat you’ll see contained in this manifest is everything that the Apollo MCP Server needs to automatically generate the resource and tools for your app. There’s no need to create or configure any of this on the MCP Server. It will automatically pick it up based on your manifest file.\n\nAnd that’s it! You can build your React app and declare tools alongside the data declarations and the tooling will do the rest. At the time this post was written, you would then test your app in ChatGPT using developer mode. OpenAI outlines how to try the app in their documentation.\n\nWith the MCP apps spec hot off the press, and likely other providers working on an answer to ChatGPT’s AppsSDK, we have a very important goal: To abstract away all of the provider details from you with a great developer experience, allowing you to focus on building your app instead.\n\nWe want this to be a true “build once” solution where you can deploy your app anywhere that supports one of the protocols that we will support. This way, you don’t need to host a separate MCP Server, and build a separate app, for every provider and sub-protocol that emerges.\n\nYou can instead focus on your customers.\n\nThis solution is exciting for platform engineers because it doesn’t require them being in the loop and becoming a blocker for the frontend teams they are looking to empower. A single Apollo MCP Server powers apps across providers and accelerates platform engineering. For frontend engineers, this removes the burden of sub-protocol concerns and lets them focus on building high-quality user experiences.\n\nIt’s important to note that these apps are still very, very early.\n\nRemember many, many years ago when “apps” first appeared on the iPhone? Many people didn’t understand why they needed a mobile app when they already had a website. It’s kind of funny looking back now because we had no idea what we were even looking at or how much it would change and shape our future.\n\nThat’s about where we are now with these conversational chat apps. Customers and companies alike don’t yet “get” these apps. The app store just launched. But once these things fall into place, and we hit an industry mind share, we believe we’re going to see an explosion of conversational, chat-based applications.\n\nTry out building apps for ChatGPT today with Apollo Client and Apollo MCP Server by going to our Template Repo and following the README. We’d love to hear what you think.",

    "description": "Apple says it can now collect any money a developer owes the tech giant at any time.",
    "fullText": "Apple on Wednesday released an updated developer license agreement that gives the company permission to recoup unpaid funds, such as commissions or any other fees, by deducting them from in-app purchases it processes on developers’ behalf, among other methods.\n\nThe change will impact developers in regions where local law allows them to link to external payment systems. In these cases, developers must report those payments back to Apple to pay the required commissions or fees.\n\nThe changed agreement seemingly gives Apple a way to collect what it believes is the correct fee if the company determines a developer has underreported their earnings.\n\nApple’s policies in this area are complex, but the change could impact developers in markets like the EU, U.S., and, now, Japan, where developers using external payment systems may be required to pay Apple varying fees or commissions depending on local law. (In the U.S., the legality of these commissions is still being disputed. A federal appeals court earlier this month ruled that a district court should consider allowing Apple to collect some commission, though not the full 27% fee it previously charged.)\n\nIn its new developer agreement, Apple states it will “offset or recoup” what it believes it is owed, including “any amounts collected by Apple on your behalf from end-users.” This means Apple could recoup funds from developers’ in-app purchases — like those for digital goods, services, and subscriptions — or from one-time fees for paid applications.\n\nAdditionally, Apple notes that it has the right to collect this money “at any time” and “from time to time,” meaning developers could face surprise deductions if Apple believes they’ve miscalculated what they owe.\n\nThe agreement doesn’t specify how Apple will determine whether it’s owed money.\n\nThe types of developer payments that vary over time are limited and include commissions, fees, and taxes. Among these is the Core Technology Fee (CTF) in the EU, which currently costs €0.50 for each first annual install exceeding one million in the past 12 months. In January 2026, Apple will transition from the CTF to a new fee, called the Core Technology Commission (CTC), a more complicated percentage-based fee. Apple will collect the CTC from apps that use external payment methods or are distributed under its alternative business terms for the EU.\n\nThe updated developer agreement also gives Apple the right to collect unpaid amounts from any “affiliates, parents, or subsidiaries” related to the account that owes money. In practical terms, that means Apple could collect the money from developers’ other apps, or from apps published by a parent company.\n\nThese changes are detailed in Schedules 2 and 3, section 3.4, which focuses on the delivery of applications to end users.\n\nThese are not the only modifications to the agreement. Apple is also introducing sections devoted to its age assurance technology, new terms for iOS apps in Japan, and other requirements.\n\nOf interest, Apple is defining requirements for voice-based assistants (like AI chatbots) that are activated via the side button on the iPhone and is banning recordings made without user awareness. This includes audio and video recordings, as well as screen recordings, which are often used by developers to identity issues users face when navigating apps or to locate bugs.\n\nTo be clear, Apple isn’t banning these recordings outright. The company is simply adding language that says: “Your Application may not be designed to facilitate Recordings of others without their awareness.” How Apple will interpret that rule remains to be seen.\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment ahead of publication.",

    "fullText": "Margaret Elaine Hamilton (née Heafield; born August 17, 1936) is an American computer scientist. She directed the Software Engineering Division at the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, where she led the development of the on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo Guidance Computer for the Apollo program. She later founded two software companies, Higher Order Software in 1976 and Hamilton Technologies in 1986, both in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nHamilton has published more than 130 papers, proceedings, and reports, about sixty projects, and six major programs. She coined the term \"software engineering\", stating, \"I began to use the term 'software engineering' to distinguish it from hardware and other kinds of engineering, yet treat each type of engineering as part of the overall systems engineering process.\"[1][2][3]\n\nOn November 22, 2016, Hamilton received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from president Barack Obama for her work leading to the development of on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo Moon missions.[4]\n\nMargaret Elaine Heafield was born August 17, 1936, in Paoli, Indiana,[5] to Kenneth Heafield and Ruth Esther Heafield (née Partington).[6][7] The family later moved to Michigan,[8] where Margaret graduated from Hancock High School in 1954.[6]\n\nShe studied mathematics at the University of Michigan in 1955 before transferring to Earlham College, where her mother had been a student.[9][10] She earned a BA in mathematics with a minor in philosophy in 1958.[9][11] She cites Florence Long, the head of the math department at Earlham, as helping with her desire to pursue abstract mathematics and become a mathematics professor.[12]\n\nShe says her poet father and headmaster grandfather inspired her to include a minor in philosophy in her studies.[13]\n\nIn Boston, Hamilton initially intended to enroll in graduate study in abstract mathematics at Brandeis University.[6] However, in mid-1959, Hamilton began working for Edward Norton Lorenz, in the meteorology department at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[14] She developed software for predicting weather, programming on the LGP-30 and the PDP-1 computers at Marvin Minsky's Project MAC.[15][16][17] Her work contributed to Lorenz's future publications on chaos theory, as acknowledged by Lorenz himself.[14] At the time, computer science and software engineering were not yet established disciplines; instead, programmers learned on the job with hands-on experience.[18] She moved on to another project in the summer of 1961, and hired and trained Ellen Fetter as her replacement.[14]\n\nFrom 1961 to 1963, Hamilton worked on the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Project at the MIT Lincoln Lab,[16] where she was one of the programmers who wrote software for the prototype AN/FSQ-7 computer (the XD-1), used by the U.S. Air Force to search for possibly unfriendly aircraft.[5] She also wrote software for a satellite tracking project at the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories.[16] The SAGE Project was an extension of Project Whirlwind, started by MIT to create a computer system that could predict weather systems and track their movements using simulators. SAGE was soon developed for military use in anti-aircraft air defense. Hamilton said:\n\nWhat they used to do when you came into this organization as a beginner, was to assign you this program which nobody was able to ever figure out or get to run. When I was the beginner they gave it to me as well. And what had happened was it was tricky programming, and the person who wrote it took delight in the fact that all of his comments were in Greek and Latin. So I was assigned this program and I actually got it to work. It even printed out its answers in Latin and Greek. I was the first one to get it to work.[19]\n\nIt was her efforts on this project that made her a candidate for the position at NASA as the lead developer for Apollo flight software.[6]\n\nHamilton learned of the Apollo project in 1965 and wanted to get involved due to it being \"very exciting\" as a Moon program.[23] She joined the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed the Apollo Guidance Computer for the Apollo lunar exploration program. Hamilton was the first programmer hired for the Apollo project at MIT and the first female programmer in the project,[23][24] and later became Director of the Software Engineering Division.[25] She was responsible for the team writing and testing all onboard in-flight software for the Apollo spacecraft's Command and Lunar Module and for the subsequent Skylab space station.[26][27][18] Another part of her team designed and developed the systems software.[28] This included error detection and recovery software such as restarts and the Display Interface Routines (also known as the Priority Displays), which Hamilton designed and developed.[29] She worked to gain hands-on experience during a time when computer science courses were uncommon and software engineering courses did not exist.[18]\n\nHer areas of expertise include systems design and software development, enterprise and process modeling, development paradigm, formal systems modeling languages, system-oriented objects for systems modeling and development, automated life-cycle environments, methods for maximizing software reliability and reuse, domain analysis, correctness by built-in language properties, open-architecture techniques for robust systems, full life-cycle automation, quality assurance, seamless integration, error detection and recovery techniques, human-machine interface systems, operating systems, end-to-end testing techniques, and life-cycle management techniques.[18][20] These techniques are intended to make code more reliable because they help programmers identify and fix errors sooner in the development process.\n\nIn one of the critical moments of the Apollo 11 mission, the Apollo Guidance Computer, together with the on-board flight software, averted an abort of the landing on the Moon. Three minutes before the lunar lander reached the Moon's surface, several computer alarms were triggered. According to software engineer Robert Wills, Buzz Aldrin entered the codes to request that the computer display altitude and other data on the computer's screen. The system was designed to support seven simultaneous programs running, but Aldrin's request was the eighth. This action was something he requested many times while working in the simulator. The result was a series of unexpected error codes during the live descent. The on-board flight software captured these alarms with the \"never supposed to happen displays\" interrupting the astronauts with priority alarm displays.[30]\nHamilton had prepared for just this situation years before:\n\nThere was one other failsafe that Hamilton likes to remember. Her \"priority display\" innovation had created a knock-on risk that astronaut and computer would slip out of sync just when it mattered most. As the alarms went off and priority displays replaced normal ones, the actual switchover to new programmes behind the screens was happening \"a step slower\" than it would today.\n\nHamilton had thought long and hard about this. It meant that if Aldrin, say, hit a button on the priority display too quickly, he might still get a \"normal\" response. Her solution: when you see a priority display, first count to\nfive.[31]\n\nBecause of the flight software's system-software's error detection and recovery techniques that included its system-wide \"kill and recompute\" from a \"safe place\" restart approach to its snapshot and rollback techniques, the Display Interface Routines (AKA the priority displays) together with its man-in-the-loop capabilities were able to be created in order to have the capability to interrupt the astronauts' normal mission displays with priority displays of critical alarms in case of an emergency. This depended on our assigning a unique priority to every process in the software in order to ensure that all of its events would take place in the correct order and at the right time relative to everything else that was going on.[39]\n\nHamilton's priority alarm displays interrupted the astronauts' normal displays to warn them that there was an emergency \"giving the astronauts a go/no-go decision (to land or not to land)\".[40] Jack Garman, a NASA computer engineer in mission control, recognized the meaning of the errors that were presented to the astronauts by the priority displays and shouted, \"Go, go!\" and they continued.[41] Paul Curto, a senior technologist who nominated Hamilton for a NASA Space Act Award, called Hamilton's work \"the foundation for ultra-reliable software design\".[28]\n\nHamilton later wrote of the incident:\n\nThe computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough to recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks than it should be performing. It then sent out an alarm, which meant to the astronaut, 'I'm overloaded with more tasks than I should be doing at this time and I'm going to keep only the more important tasks'; i.e., the ones needed for landing ... Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software. The software's action, in this case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones ... If the computer hadn't recognized this problem and taken recovery action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful Moon landing it was.\n\n— Letter from Margaret H. Hamilton, Director of Apollo Flight Computer Programming MIT Draper Laboratory, Cambridge, Massachusetts, titled \"Computer Got Loaded\", published in Datamation, March 1, 1971[42]\n\nIn 1976, Hamilton co-founded with Saydean Zeldin a company called Higher Order Software (HOS)[43] to further develop ideas about error prevention and fault tolerance emerging from their experience at MIT working on the Apollo program.[44][45] They created a product called USE.IT, based on the HOS methodology they developed at MIT.[46][47][48] It was successfully used in numerous government programs[49][50] including a project to formalize and implement C-IDEF, an automated version of IDEF, a modeling language developed by the U.S. Air Force in the Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing (ICAM) project.[51] In 1980, British-Israeli computer scientist David Harel published a proposal for a structured programming language derived from HOS from the viewpoint of and/or subgoals.[52] Others have used HOS to formalize the semantics of linguistic quantifiers,[53] and to formalize the design of reliable real-time embedded systems.[54]\n\nHamilton was the CEO of HOS through 1984[44] and left the company in 1985. In March 1986, she founded Hamilton Technologies, Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company was developed around the Universal Systems Language (USL) and its associated automated environment, the 001 Tool Suite, based on her paradigm of development before the fact for systems design and software development.[35][55][56]\n\nHamilton has been credited with naming the discipline of \"software engineering\".[1][57][58][59] Hamilton details how she came to make up the term \"software engineering\":\n\nWhen I first came up with the term, no one had heard of it before, at least in our world. It was an ongoing joke for a long time. They liked to kid me about my radical ideas. It was a memorable day when one of the most respected hardware gurus explained to everyone in a meeting that he agreed with me that the process of building software should also be considered an engineering discipline, just like with hardware. Not because of his acceptance of the new 'term' per se, but because we had earned his and the acceptance of the others in the room as being in an engineering field in its own right.[39]\n\nWhen Hamilton started using the term \"software engineering\" during the early Apollo missions,[60] software development was not taken seriously compared to other engineering disciplines,[61] nor was it regarded as a science. Hamilton was concerned with legitimizing software development as an engineering discipline.[62] Over time the term \"software engineering\" gained the same respect as any other technical discipline.[57][63] The IEEE Software September/October 2018 issue celebrates the 50th anniversary of software engineering.[64] Hamilton talks about \"Errors\" and how they influenced her work related to software engineering and how her language, USL, could be used to prevent the majority of \"Errors\" in a system.[65] With USL, rather than continuing to test for errors, her program was designed to keep most errors out of the system from the beginning.[66] USL was created after her knowledge and experience from the Apollo mission, in which she determined a mathematical theory for systems and software.[67] This method was then, and still is, highly impactful to the field of software engineering. Writing in Wired, Robert McMillan noted: \"At MIT she assisted in the creation of the core principles in computer programming as she worked with her colleagues in writing code for the world's first portable computer\".[68] Hamilton's innovations go beyond the feats of playing an important role in getting humans to the Moon. According to Wired's Karen Tegan Padir: \"She, along with that other early programming pioneer, COBOL inventor Grace Hopper, also deserve tremendous credit for helping to open the door for more women to enter and succeed in STEM fields like software.\"[69][70]\n\nIn 2017, a \"Women of NASA\" LEGO set went on sale featuring minifigures of Hamilton, astronauts Mae Jemison and Sally Ride, and NASA's first Chief of Astronomy, Nancy Grace Roman. The set was initially proposed by Maia Weinstock as a tribute to the women's contributions to NASA history, and Hamilton's section of the set features a recreation of her famous 1969 photo posing with a stack of her software listings.[71][72]\n\nIn 2019, to celebrate 50 years after the Apollo landing, Google decided to make a tribute to Hamilton. The mirrors at the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility were configured to create a picture of Hamilton and the Apollo 11 by moonlight.[73]\n\nMargo Madison, a fictional NASA engineer in the alternate history series For All Mankind, was inspired by Hamilton.[74]\n\nHamilton has a sister, Kathryn Heafield.[86]\n\nShe met her first husband, James Cox Hamilton,[87] in the mid-1950s while attending college. They were married on June 15, 1958, the summer after she graduated from Earlham.[88][87] She briefly taught high school mathematics and French at a public school in Boston, Indiana.[88][16] The couple then moved to Boston, Massachusetts,[16] where they had a daughter, Lauren, born on November 10, 1959.[6] They divorced in 1967 and Margaret married Dan Lickly two years later.[87][89]",

    "fullText": "The Texas City disaster was an industrial accident that occurred on April 16, 1947, in the port of Texas City, Texas, United States, located in Galveston Bay. It was the deadliest industrial accident in U.S. history and one of history's largest non-nuclear explosions.\n\nThe explosion was triggered by a mid-morning fire on board the French-registered vessel SS Grandcamp (docked at port), which detonated her cargo of about 2,300 tons (about 2,100 metric tons) of ammonium nitrate.[1] This started a chain reaction of fires and explosions aboard other ships and in nearby oil-storage facilities, ultimately killing at least 581 people, including all but one member of Texas City's volunteer fire department.[2]: 100\n\nThe disaster drew the first class action lawsuit against the United States government, on behalf of 8,485 plaintiffs, under the 1946 Federal Tort Claims Act.\n\nThe Port of Texas City is located in a protected harbor inland from Galveston, with relatively straight access to the Gulf of Mexico.[2]: 6  The port expanded greatly during World War II, as many wartime chemical and oil plants were located in or near the city. In 1946, some 4,000 ships loaded or unloaded cargo in the port.[2]: 9  The growth of the town caused a housing shortage, and housing for Black and Hispanic residents was located close to the port.[2]: 10  The nearest neighborhood was only .5 miles (0.80 km) away from the site of the explosion.[2]: 11  Within 1 mile (1.6 km) there were six major chemical or oil companies, nine piers, eleven warehouses, a grain elevator, and many homes.[2]: 12\n\nWhile oil and chemicals had been the major export, the port also began shipping ammonium nitrate in 1945.[2]: 15  The ammonium nitrate, needed either as fertilizer or an explosive, was manufactured in Nebraska and Iowa and shipped to Texas City by rail before being loaded onto ships.[3] The dedicated Texas City Terminal Railway provided final mile service directly to the port.[2]: 11  Export of ammonium nitrate increased significantly in the postwar years as ammunition manufacturing was converted into fertilizer manufacturing, to be sent for export to rebuild war-torn Europe.[2]: 20\n\nSS Grandcamp was a recently re-activated 437-foot-long (133 m) Liberty ship. Originally named SS Benjamin R. Curtis in Los Angeles in 1942, the ship served in the Pacific theater and was mothballed in Philadelphia after the war.[4] In a Cold War gesture, the ship was assigned by the U.S. to the French Line to assist in the rebuilding of France, along with other efforts in Europe. Accordingly, she was captained by a French crew led by Captain Charles de Guillebon. Along with the ammonium nitrate—a very common cargo on the high seas—she was carrying small-arms ammunition, machinery, and bales of sisal twine on the deck.[2]: 19  Her engine was undergoing repairs while docked and thus the ship was inoperable.[2]: 32\n\nAnother ship in the harbor, SS High Flyer, was docked about 600 feet (200 m) away from Grandcamp. The ammonium nitrate aboard the two ships, and fertilizer in an adjacent warehouse, were intended for export to farmers in Europe. Grandcamp had arrived from Houston, where the port authority did not permit the loading of ammonium nitrate.\n\nGrandcamp had a mixed cargo, containing chiefly ammonium nitrate, but also twine, peanuts, tobacco, some small arms ammunition, engineering equipment, and cotton.[2]: 1  The ammonium nitrate was manufactured in a patented process, mixed with clay, petrolatum, rosin and paraffin wax to avoid moisture caking. It was packaged in 100 pounds (45 kg) paper sacks.[2]: 20  Longshoremen reported the bags were warm to the touch before loading.\n\nHigh Flyer held an additional 961 short tons (872 t) of ammonium nitrate[1] and 1,800 short tons (1,600 metric tons) of sulfur.[citation needed]\n\nGrandcamp arrived in port on April 11, 1947, and began loading 2,500 short tons (2,300 t) of fertilizer on April 14, which were to be sent to France.[2]: 19  The storage deck of Grandcamp was divided into five storage holds, with a fuel oil bunker located between Hold 3 and Hold 4. The fertilizer was to be added to Hold 2 and Hold 4. The loading continued until interrupted by rain on the evening of the 15th. Loading was set to continue on the morning of the 16th, with the last 600 short tons (540 t) set to be loaded into the partially full Hold 4.[2]: 19, 35\n\nOn Wednesday, April 16, 1947, around 8 a.m., smoke was spotted in the cargo hold of Grandcamp while it was still moored. Longshoremen used a gallon jug of water and two fire extinguishers, but they had no effect and the cargo hold filled with smoke. The longshoremen were then ordered to leave the hold. At this point, the captain of Grandcamp ordered that no water be used, lest the cargo be ruined. Instead, he ordered all hatches sealed and the hold to be filled with steam in an attempt to smother the fire.[2]: 2  This was unlikely to be effective, as ammonium nitrate is an oxidizer, thus neutralizing the extinguishing properties of steam. The steam may have contributed to the fire by converting the ammonium nitrate to nitrous oxide, while augmenting the already intense heat in the ship's hold.[5] Around 8:30 a.m. the stevedores who were fighting the fire were ordered off the ship, likely because the heat had become too intense and there were concerns that the small arms ammunition could cook off.[2]: 31\n\nWhile the port had fire hydrants, it lacked its own fire engines. A call for outside help was sent at 8:37.[2]: 31  Responding fire departments included the Texas City volunteer fire department and the Republic Oil Refining Company firefighting team.[2]: 2  As crews fought the fire, the hatch on Hold 4 blew off from the pressure of the steam. A column of yellow-orange smoke billowed out, the typical color for nitrogen dioxide fumes.[1] The fire and its unusual-looking smoke attracted a crowd of about 500 spectators (including many children) along the shoreline, who believed they were at a safe distance.[6] Around 9:00, the fire abated slightly, but the steam suppression system was still actively heating Hold 4. Most of the crew had disembarked the ship, and Captain Guillebon was taking a headcount on the pier.[2]: 34\n\nAt 9:12 a.m., the ammonium nitrate reached an explosive threshold and the Grandcamp detonated. The exact cause is unknown, but the likeliest explanation is that the heat of the fire caused the fuel oil bunker adjacent to Hold 4 to split, pouring fuel onto the hot, decomposing fertilizer, creating an impromptu ANFO mixture that was susceptible to detonation.[2]: 35  The Grandcamp was entirely obliterated. The resulting explosion caused utter destruction within 2,000 feet (610 m) and extreme damage throughout the port. The tremendous blast produced a 15 ft (4.6 m) tsunami and a shockwave, levelling nearly 1,000 buildings on land.[2]: 3  The tsunami was responsible for a significant portion of onlooker deaths.[2]: 37\n\nFlying shrapnel resulted in ignition of refineries and chemical tanks along the waterfront. Falling bales of burning twine from Grandcamp's cargo added to the damage, and her anchor was hurled across the city. Two sightseeing airplanes flying nearby were blown out of the sky,[7] while 8 miles (13 km) away, half of the windows in Galveston were shattered.[8] The explosion blew almost 6,350 short tons (5,760 t) of the ship's steel into the air, some at supersonic speed.\n\nThe Monsanto Chemical Company plant adjacent to the slip where Grandcamp was docked suffered the brunt of the first explosion. Of its 574 employees and contractors, 234 were killed, and 200 more were injured. Every man of the Monsanto fire fighting team, which were laying hose reels opposite the Grandcamp, was killed.[2]: 37–38\n\nThe exact damage caused by the first explosion is not fully ascertainable, as the second explosion wreaked further havoc and came before a survey of the damage could be done.[2]: 38\n\nSeven ruptured oil tanks at the Republic Refinery began to burn, letting off thick clouds of black smoke.[2]: 39  Burning sulfur in a dockside warehouse created acrid fumes.[2]: 40\n\nOfficial casualty estimates came to a total of 567, including all the crewmen who remained aboard Grandcamp. All but one member of the 28-man Texas City volunteer fire department were killed in the initial explosion on the docks while fighting the shipboard fire. With fires raging throughout Texas City, first responders from other areas were initially unable to reach the site of the disaster.\n\nStill, 112 people within 500 ft (150 m) of the Grandcamp survived, including many witnesses who would allow for later reconstruction of the events.[2]: 37–38\n\nThe first explosion had set Highflyer free from its moorings, and it had drifted across the harbor, coming to rest against SS Wilson B. Keene. Her crew stayed aboard for an hour before the smoke of the burning oil and sulfur forced them to leave. In the afternoon, two men boarded Highflyer searching for injured crewmembers. They noted that her cargo was ablaze and reported it to someone on the harborfront. This message seems to have gone unheeded for several hours until it was realized that this indicated a serious problem. Only around 11 p.m. did tugboats attempt to pull Highflyer away from the docks. Despite having cut her anchor, they were unable to move her. They fled the area around 1 a.m. the next day (April 17). Ten minutes later, at 1:10 a.m., Highflyer exploded, killing two more people. According to witnesses, the explosion was more powerful than that of Grandcamp. Casualties were light since the docks had already been evacuated, but the second explosion exacerbated the damage to nearby ships and buildings. The blast destroyed the nearby Wilson B. Keene. The steel frame of Highflyer had been heated until glowing, and these chunks rained down upon Texas City setting mass fires.[2]: 4–5, 40–41  One of the propellers was blown off and subsequently found nearly a mile inland. It is now in a memorial park near the anchor of Grandcamp.\n\nThe Texas City disaster is generally considered the worst industrial accident in U.S. history. Witnesses compared the scene to the fairly recent images of the 1943 air raid on Bari and the much larger devastation after an atomic bomb was dropped at Nagasaki.\n\nOf the dead, 405 were identified and 63 have never been identified. The latter remains were placed in a memorial cemetery in the north part of Texas City near Moses Lake. An additional 113 people were classified as missing, for no identifiable parts were ever found. This figure includes firefighters who were aboard Grandcamp when she exploded. There is some speculation that there were hundreds more killed but uncounted, including visiting seamen, undocumented laborers and their families, and an untold number of travelers. More than 800 people were left orphaned or widowed.[2]: 6  However, there were also some survivors among people as close as 70 feet (21 m) from the dock. The victims' bodies quickly filled the local morgue. Several bodies were laid out in the local high school's gymnasium for identification by family or friends.\n\nMore than 5,000 people were injured, with 1,784 admitted to 21 area hospitals. More than 500 homes were destroyed and hundreds damaged, leaving 2,000 homeless. The seaport was destroyed, and many businesses were flattened or burned. Over 1,100 vehicles were damaged and 362 freight cars were obliterated; the property damage was estimated at $100 million[3] (equivalent to $1,100,000,000 in 2024). This number may not encompass the full scope of damage: a further $500 million of oil products burned (equivalent to $5,499,000,000 in 2024).\n\nA 2-short-ton (1.8-metric-ton) anchor of Grandcamp was hurled 1.62 miles (2.61 km) and found in a 10-foot (3 m) crater. It was installed at a memorial park. The other main 5-short-ton (4.5-metric-ton) anchor was hurled 1⁄2 mile (800 m) to the entrance of the Texas City Dike. It rests on a \"Texas-shaped\" memorial at the entrance. Burning wreckage ignited everything within miles, including dozens of oil and chemical tanks. The nearby city of Galveston was covered with an oily fog that left deposits over every exposed outdoor surface.\n\nSome of the deaths and damage in Texas City were due to the destruction and subsequent burning of several chemical plants (including Monsanto and Union Carbide), oil storage, and other facilities near the explosions. Twenty-seven of the twenty-eight members of Texas City's volunteer fire department and three of four members of the Texas City Heights Volunteer Fire Department who were on the docks near the burning ship were killed. One firefighter, Fred Dowdy, who had not responded to the initial call, coordinated other firefighters arriving from communities up to 60 miles (100 km) away. Alvin Fussell, sole survivor of the Heights Volunteer firefighters, was driving to work in Alvin when he heard of the fire on the radio. Eventually 200 firefighters arrived from as far away as Los Angeles. Fires resulting from the cataclysmic events were still burning a week after the disaster, and the process of body recovery took nearly a month. All four fire engines of Texas City were twisted and burned husks.\n\nThe cause of the initial fire on board Grandcamp was never determined. It may have been started by a cigarette discarded the previous day, meaning the ship's cargo had been smoldering throughout the night when the fire was discovered on the morning of the explosion.[1] Historian Hugh Stephens later identified human error as the cause, and cites numerous reasons as to why a minor fire became such a severe incident.[2]: 6\n\nStephens identifies as root causes the expansion of the port, the proximity of dangerous port operations to the rest of Texas City, a lack of community awareness of the danger posed by chemical hazards, and a lack of safety preparation.\n\nSmoking was commonplace at the time. While officially prohibited at the port, such prohibitions were not enforced and smoking was widespread.[2]: 28–29\n\nStephens notes that in interviews and written accounts, few residents of Texas City seemed to understand the danger of the port, as exemplified by the large crowd that assembled to watch the Grandcamp burn. Stephens suggests that in an era before disasters like Bhopal (1984), or Superfund legislation (1986), the sense of danger from chemicals was amorphous. \"Before the accident, Texas City's citizens felt secure because such a disaster had never happened and they could therefore assume it never would.\"[2]: 13  Stephens also points out that Texas City was a boomtown in a time when the rest of the country was still recovering from the Great Depression, in which most of the city owed its prosperity to the oil and chemical industry, which may have further led to lax attitudes.[2]: 14\n\nThe danger of ammonium nitrate may not have been well known at the time. While Army manuals classified it as a high explosive, general belief (and even guidance from the Department of Agriculture) held that fertilizer was not dangerous under typical conditions.[2]: 21–22  However, the danger was not unknown. The Port of Houston had forbidden the loading of fertilizer in 1946.[2]: 24\n\nIn the months before the disaster, local Catholic priest William F. Roach remarked on the concerning industrial conditions by stating \"I feel like I’m sitting on a keg of dynamite.\"[9]\n\nNeither the Port of Texas City, the Texas City Terminal Railway, the City itself, nor any of the oil refineries, had a disaster preparedness plan—which even at the time was regarded as inadequate.[2]: 13–14  The Port itself had no Port authority that could regulate both land and sea operations. Thus, safety was fragmented between companies and between land and sea. The end of military supervision at the end of the war also played a role. Safety authority should have transferred from the military back to the United States Coast Guard, but the Coast Guard failed to take preventative actions and safety instead returned to the hands of private parties.[2]: 16–17  Texas City also failed to police or regulate the dock; such matters were left to security hired by the Terminal Railway.[2]: 27\n\nThe disaster received national media attention, with offers of assistance coming from around the country. Several funds were established to handle donations, particularly the Texas City Relief Fund, created by the city's mayor Curtis Trahan.[2]: 104–105  One of the largest fundraising efforts for the city and the victims of the disaster was organized by Sam Maceo, one of the two brothers who ran organized crime in Galveston at the time. Maceo organized a large-scale benefit on the island, featuring entertainers including Phil Harris, Frank Sinatra, and Ann Sheridan.[2]: 104–105 [10] In the end, the Texas City Relief Fund raised more than $1 million ($15 million in today's terms). Payouts for fire insurance claims reached nearly $4 million ($55.7 million in today's terms).[2]: 104–105\n\nWithin days of the disaster, major companies that had lost facilities in the explosions announced plans to rebuild in Texas City and in some cases to expand their operations. Some companies implemented policies of retaining all of the hourly workers who had previously worked at destroyed facilities with plans to use them in the rebuilding. Cost estimates of the industrial reconstruction were estimated at approximately $100 million ($1.41 billion adjusted for inflation).[2]: 104–105\n\n\"Commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the explosion [...], just as the Phoenix bird symbolizes resurrection from the ashes of despair, the 'Phoenix Fountain' epitomizes courage and the triumph of the human spirit. [...] Chewelah, Washington Artist David Govedare was commissioned by Mayor Charles T. Doyle [...] [to] produce this twelve foot sculpture from half inch cor-ten steel. Architect Joseph Allen Hoover and City Engineer James McWhorter designed the fountain built by Texas City's Public Works Department.\"[11]\n\nMany of the legal cases seeking compensation were combined into Elizabeth Dalehite, et al. v. United States, under the recently enacted Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). On April 13, 1950, the district court found the United States government responsible for a litany of negligent acts of omission and commission by 168 named agencies and their representatives, in the manufacture, packaging, and labeling of ammonium nitrate. This was further compounded by errors in transport, storage, loading, fire prevention, and fire suppression, all of which led to the explosions and the subsequent carnage.\n\nOn June 10, 1952, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned this decision, finding that the United States maintained the right to exercise its own \"discretion\" in vital national matters. The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed that decision (346 U.S. 15, June 8, 1953), in a 4-to-3 opinion, noting that the district court had no jurisdiction under the federal statute to find the government liable for \"negligent planning decisions\" which were properly delegated to various departments and agencies. In short, the FTCA clearly exempts \"failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty\", and the court found that all of the alleged acts in this case were discretionary in nature.[12]\n\nIn its dissent, the three justices argued that, under the FTCA, \"Congress has defined the tort liability of the government as analogous to that of a private person\", i.e., when carrying out duties unrelated to governing. In this case, \"a policy adopted in the exercise of an immune discretion was carried out carelessly by those in charge of detail\", and that a private person would certainly be held liable for such acts. A private person is held to a higher standard of care when carrying out \"inherently dangerous\" acts such as transportation and storage of explosives.\n\nAccording to Melvin Belli in his book Ready for the Plaintiff! (1965), Congress acted to provide some compensation after the courts refused to do so.[13] The Dalehite decision was eventually \"appealed\" to Congress, where relief was granted by means of legislation (Public Law 378, 69 Stat. 707 (1955)).[14] When the last claim had been processed in 1957, 1,394 awards totaling nearly $17 million had been made.",

    "fullText": "A private jet crashed at a regional North Carolina airport and erupted into flames Thursday, killing seven people, including retired NASCAR star Greg Biffle and three members of his family, officials said.\n\nHere are some things to know about the crash.\n\nThe plane took off Thursday morning from Statesville Regional Airport, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of Charlotte. Shortly after takeoff, the jet turned back toward the airport and crashed while attempting to land, according to tracking data posted by FlightAware.com.\n\nVideo from WSOC-TV showed first responders rushing onto the runway, where flames burned near scattered wreckage.\n\nInvestigators have said it is too early to determine what caused the crash. There was some drizzle and clouds at the time, according to AccuWeather.\n\nStatesville Regional Airport offers corporate aviation facilities for Fortune 500 companies and several NASCAR teams, according to its website.\n\nAccording to a joint statement released by the victims' families, there were seven people aboard the plane, including Greg Biffle; his wife, Cristina Grossu Biffle; their son, Ryder; and Greg Biffle's daughter, Emma.\n\nThe statement identified the other victims as Craig Wadsworth, Dennis Dutton and Dutton's son, Jack, all “beloved by many in the NASCAR community.”\n\n“Each of them meant everything to us, and their absence leaves an immeasurable void in our lives,” the statement said.\n\nBiffle, 55, won more than 50 races across NASCAR’s three circuits, including 19 at the Cup Series level. He also won championships in both the lower-tier national Truck and Xfinity Series — the first driver to do so — and spent almost his entire career driving for Roush Fenway Racing, headquartered about 40 miles south of the crash site.\n\nWadsworth, a longtime behind-the-scenes employee with several NASCAR teams, was friends with Biffle and had helped him with odd jobs, including delivering supplies to places hit by Hurricane Helene a year ago, according to Wadsworth's roommate, Benito Howell.\n\nBiffle joins a somber roll of athletes who died in plane or helicopter crashes.\n\nThe plane was a Cessna C550, a popular mid-sized business jet with an excellent reputation, aviation safety expert Jeff Guzzetti said. Flight records show the plane was registered to a company run by Greg Biffle.\n\nThe plane was scheduled to fly to Sarasota, Florida, and then to Treasure Cay airport in the Bahamas before returning.\n\nBiffle's plane was built in 1981 and would have likely cost between $1 million and $10 million, depending on how it was outfitted, Guzzetti said. The Cessna 550 Citation has two engines and typically seats six to eight passengers.",

    "title": "Most millionaires don't consider themselves wealthy. So what does it really mean to be rich?",
    "description": "New data shows that having at least $1 million doesn’t necessarily mean you’re rich. Here’s what it really takes to feel financially secure today.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nJust one third (36%) of the nation’s wealthiest citizens — those with at least $1 million in investable assets — consider themselves wealthy, according to Northwestern Mutual’s 2025 Planning and Progress study.\n\nFurther, nearly half (49%) of American millionaires say their financial planning needs improvement, citing the possibility of outliving their savings, the impact of taxes in retirement, and potential long-term care needs as their top financial concerns.\n\nThis gap may be surprising, but it highlights how rising costs, longer lifespans, and shifting expectations have redefined what it means to feel rich in modern America.\n\nOne reason most millionaires don’t consider themselves wealthy is because our definition of wealth has changed over time.\n\n“Being a millionaire used to mean you had done really well and ‘made it,’” said Tom Mathews, CFEd, CPA, and author of \"How Money Works.\" “Today, it really just means you’ve crossed an outdated line.”\n\nMathews explained the problem isn’t necessarily that people have less money today, but rather, they have less certainty and control around their finances. “Things like inflation, rising taxes, market volatility, and the escalating cost of housing, healthcare, and education have changed what financial security feels like,” he said. “A million dollars on paper doesn’t stretch the way it used to, especially when most of that net worth is tied up in illiquid assets like homes, retirement accounts, or businesses.”\n\nThere’s also the issue of longevity. With people living longer, a seven-figure portfolio may not seem substantial when it’s expected to fund decades of living expenses and rising medical costs.\n\nIn other words, Mathews said, many people might look wealthy on paper, but that doesn’t mean they feel financially secure.\n\nIf millionaires don’t necessarily feel wealthy, what does it take to feel rich in today’s economy?\n\nAccording to Charles Schwab’s 2025 Modern Wealth Survey, Americans need an average net worth of $839,000 to be financially comfortable, and $2.3 million to feel wealthy.\n\nAdditionally, 63% of survey respondents said it feels like it takes more money to be wealthy today when compared with last year, citing the impact of inflation (73%), a worsened economy (62%), and higher taxes (48%) as the top reasons.\n\nBut experts say feeling wealthy isn’t just about how much money you have. The key is achieving true financial security.\n\n“The real takeaway is that wealth is no longer about accumulation. It’s about confidence,” Mathews said. “Confidence comes from education, strategy, and structure.” He added that when people understand how money works, they stop guessing or reacting to headlines and start making more informed decisions. “That’s when wealth finally feels like wealth,” he said.\n\nReaching true financial security is a personal journey; everyone has their own idea of what that looks like. However, there are financial moves you can make to improve your financial situation and feel more secure.\n\nCreate a clear financial plan: The Northwestern Mutual Study found that millionaires are much more likely to report higher levels of financial discipline, confidence, and clarity than the average American. Having a clear understanding of your budget, financial goals, and long-term wealth-building strategy can make you feel more confident in your future.\n\nPrioritize paying off debt and saving more: Your net worth is a key indicator of your financial health. And the formula for improving your net worth is fairly simple: Increase what you own (assets) and decrease what you owe (debts). That’s why it’s smart to prioritize paying down debt and increasing your savings to build a higher net worth over time.\n\nSeek help from a professional: There’s no shame in asking for help. In fact, according to the survey, millionaires are more than twice as likely to work with a financial advisor than the general public (74% vs. 34%, respectively). Consulting a professional can help you better understand your finances and create a plan with your specific goals in mind.\n\nLearn the difference between cash and cash equivalents, plus examples and when these low-risk options make sense for savers.\n\nYour personal cash burn rate shows how fast you spend money each month. Learn how to calculate it and use it to protect your savings.\n\nThese AI tools for freelancers can help you run a more efficient business. Because as a freelancer, more free time can mean more money in your bank account.\n\nThe Beige Book, a report published by the Federal Reserve, gathers real-world business insights and helps guide future Fed policy decisions.\n\nHow many millionaires are there in America, and how can you join their ranks? Here’s a closer look at millionaires in the U.S. and their financial habits.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is easing some federal restrictions on marijuana.\n\nTrump signed an executive order on Thursday that will reclassify marijuana to a Schedule III drug, putting it on par with drugs like ketamine and anabolic steroids.\n\n\"We have people begging for me to do this, people that are in great pain,\" Trump said during an event in the Oval Office, flanked by several doctors.\n\nThe order falls short of fully legalizing marijuana, but it will make it easier for researchers to study the drug.\n\nTrump said that he had been lobbied to make the change by people with extreme pain, incurable diseases, and seizure disorders, among others. The president noted the substance's medical uses, including as a \"substitute for addictive and potentially lethal opioid painkillers.\"\n\nThe move could also bring tax relief to marijuana businesses operating in states that have already legalized the substance.\n\nMarijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug, a category for substances with \"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse,\" according to the Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\nSchedule III drugs, on the other hand, have a \"moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.\"\n\nMarijuana stocks surged last week amid widespread rumors of Trump's impending order. Most of the sector's most prominent names continued trending upward with this week on mounting speculation for the pro-cannabis policy decision.\n\nNews of Trump signing the executive order continued to boost the industry's biggest players. Tilray Brands, typically seen as a leader among cannabis stocks, jumped 6% today while Aurora Cannabis rose 9% and Canopy Growth Corporation spiked 11%.\n\nThese cannabis stocks are all relatively small cap and are prone to price swings, but the signing of an executive order is a highly bullish catalyst for the industry.\n\nAs he campaigned for a third time in 2024, Trump signaled that he would take a friendlier approach toward marijuana than he did during his first term.\n\n\"I promised to be the president of common sense, and that is exactly what we're doing,\" Trump said on Thursday.\n\nHe said that he would vote for a ballot measure in Florida aimed at legalizing marijuana for recreational use in the state. That measure garnered 56% of the vote but ultimately fell short of the 60% required for passage.\n\nTrump also said in 2024 that he supported enacting laws to make it easier for marijuana businesses to operate.",

    "fullText": "The nation's largest HR trade group has been sued by a woman who alleges it revoked a job offer because it didn't want her medical service dog in the office.\n\nThe lawsuit filed Tuesday by Fiona Torres against the Society for Human Resource Management says she is diabetic, and the dog can detect changes in her blood-sugar levels faster and more reliably than a top-tier glucose monitor.\n\nSHRM says it \"fully complied\" with the Americans with Disabilities Act in offering Torres an alternative \"reasonable accommodation\" for her health condition.\n\nTorres' lawsuit was filed less than two weeks after SHRM was ordered to pay $11.5 million in an unrelated race discrimination and retaliation case.\n\nThe new complaint alleges that in June 2024, SHRM offered Torres a role as a senior specialist in its product management department at its office in Alexandria, Virginia, then revoked the offer in July because she wanted to bring her dog to work.\n\nTorres said SHRM's offer to accommodate her medical needs was to allow her to keep food, water, and an insulin pump at her desk, which she felt was insufficient.\n\n\"I was ready and able to work,\" Torres said in an email to Business Insider through her attorney. \"They said they were eager to have me until they found out I had a disability and a service dog.\"\n\nThe complaint quotes an email from SHRM to Torres denying her accommodation request.\n\n\"[I]t does not appear there are any reasonable accommodations that would allow you to perform the essential functions of the role,\" SHRM wrote, according to the complaint.\n\nSHRM spokesman Eddie Burke declined to comment on the specifics of the suit, saying the organization was still reviewing the legal papers.\n\n\"We support the ADA and are actively committed to supporting employees through fair, respectful, and legally compliant accommodation processes,\" he said. \"We fully complied with the ADA in this matter and, in consultation with outside legal counsel, met all of our obligations to provide reasonable accommodations to Fiona Torres.\"\n\nLori Kisch, a lawyer for Torres, told Business Insider that SHRM's alleged conduct was \"ironic\" given that it provides information and resources to help HR professionals follow laws such as the ADA.\n\n\"They can't argue that they don't understand the law, and their actions are a reckless indifference to the law,\" she said.\n\nTorres' case, filed in federal court in Virginia, follows a lawsuit brought by a former SHRM employee that alleged race discrimination and retaliation. Rehab Mohamed, a Black and Egyptian instructional designer, claimed her SHRM manager held her to higher standards than white employees. A jury found SHRM liable for $11.5 million in damages.\n\nSHRM has said it plans to file an appeal and that the verdict \"does not reflect the facts, the law, or the truth of how\" it operates.",

Winterfest is here, and that means lots of free stuff. As has become tradition in Fortnite, Epic Games has brought back the Winterfest Cabin, which is full of free cosmetics waiting to be opened.\n\nThere are 14 free gifts available in the cabin, and you can open one each day. In past years, these gifts would stack--if you missed a day, you'd be able to open two the following day. But it doesn't work that way this year. This time, you really can only open one present each day, no matter what. So be sure to keep up with them, or else you might miss out on some of the gifts.\n\nAs you can see from the graphic, this year's collection of gifts includes two free skins, two back blings, two pickaxes, two musical instruments, a glider, a weapon wrap, a Fortnite-original jam track based on Carol of the Bells, a contrail, and a few sprays and emoticons for good measure.\n\nThe skins are in the two large presents in the back on the left side of the room, but you won't be able to open them at the start. You can unlock the Glacial Dummy skin after opening seven other presents, which means he'll be available on Christmas day, And you can get Cheeks, the hamster man, only after you've picked every other present, which means he'll unlock on New Year's Eve.\n\nBeyond those two skins, you can unlock the presents in any order you want. And despite the fact there's a Hogwarts student chilling in the cabin while the Harry Potter movie theme plays, none of the free gifts have anything to do with the Harry Potter franchise.\n\nFor a better look at some of the free rewards, as pulled by fortnite.gg, you can pull from this year's Winterfest Cabin, scroll on.

Fortunately, I can usually gauge how crowded a lounge is by the presence of a line at the entry.\n\nA lot of lounges I've visited don't allow new visitors when they're close to capacity, so finding a seat is usually not an issue.\n\nIf I'm not familiar with a lounge's layout, I'll take a lap to see all the available seating. I love a comfortable chair with built-in USB ports so I can charge my phone, so I'll look for that type of seating first.\n\nI also like to sit away from the buffet, bar, and restrooms so I can have as quiet an atmosphere as possible.\n\nFood varies widely from lounge to lounge, from chef-curated menus to bowls of trail mix and grab-and-go snacks, but there are typically plenty of hot food offerings.\n\nThey can be tempting, but I don't have that \"it's free, and it's there\" mentality, so I won't load up my plate unless I'm starving or know I won't be eating for a while. I don't want to feel too full or bloated before a long flight.\n\nThe bar is always a happening spot for travelers, but I take it easy on the alcohol some lounges give out for free.\n\nI might have a drink once in a while, but I don't want to get dehydrated before a long flight or lose my inhibitions to the point where I'm not watching my belongings or the time.\n\nEven if I'm tired and a lounge has comfy, reclining chairs, I don't sleep in airport lounges. I'm always too nervous I'll miss my flight.\n\nI've never had a lengthy layover during which I was that exhausted, plus most lounges have time limits on how long people can be inside them.\n\nGetting off my feet and relaxing is usually enough of a break if I'm tired.\n\nUnless a lounge is virtually empty, I don't take up more than one seat or put my backpack on its own chair. I get frustrated when I'm looking for a seat, but many are unavailable because people are using them as storage.\n\nUsing headphones is also a cardinal rule in airport lounges, although I often see people being inconsiderate by streaming or using FaceTime without them.\n\nI also wouldn't engage in some behaviors I see in lounges that I find gross, such as removing shoes to put bare feet on airport furniture or taking care of personal grooming — like clipping nails — outside a restroom.\n\nLounges provide a comfortable, home-like environment, but I try to remember that they are public spaces. I wish other people would, too.\n\nI love having lounge access, but I won't leave my flight's terminal to seek one out unless my layover is at least two hours long.\n\nEven then, I hesitate to go unless I'm familiar with the airport. I never want to miss a flight just because I wanted some extra comfort before it.\n\nThis story was originally published on July 25, 2024, and most recently updated on December 18, 2025.",

    "fullText": "A Kansas tribe said it has walked away from a nearly $30 million federal contract to come up with preliminary designs for immigrant detention centers after facing a wave of online criticism.\n\nThe Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation 's announcement Wednesday night came just over a week after the economic development leaders who brokered the deal with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement were fired.\n\nWith some Native Americans swept up and detained in recent ICE raids, the deal was derided online as “disgusting” and “cruel.\" Many in Indian Country also questioned how a tribe whose own ancestors were uprooted two centuries ago from the Great Lakes region and corralled on a reservation south of Topeka could participate in the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts.\n\nTribal Chairman Joseph “Zeke” Rupnick nodded to the historic issues last week in a video address that called reservations \"the government’s first attempts at detention centers.” In an update Wednesday, he announced that he was “happy to share that our Nation has successfully exited all third-party related interests affiliated with ICE.”\n\nThe Prairie Band Potawatomi has a range of businesses that provide health care management staffing, general contracting and even interior design. And Rupnick said in his latest address that tribal officials plan to meet in January about how to ensure “economic interests do not come into conflict with our values in the future.”\n\nA tribal offshoot hired by ICE — KPB Services LLC — was established in April in Holton, Kansas, by Ernest C. Woodward Jr., a former naval officer who markets himself as a “go-to” adviser for tribes and affiliated companies seeking to land federal contracts.\n\nThe Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation said in 2017 that Woodward’s firm advised it on its acquisition of another government contractor, Mill Creek LLC, which specializes in outfitting federal buildings and the military with office furniture and medical equipment.\n\nWoodward also is listed as the chief operating officer of the Florida branch of Prairie Band Construction Inc., which was registered in September.\n\nAttempts to locate Woodward were unsuccessful. A spokesperson for KPB said Woodward is no longer with the LLC but she declined to say whether he was terminated. Woodward did not respond to an email sent to another consulting firm he’s affiliated with, Virginia-based Chinkapin Partners LLC.\n\nA spokesperson for the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation said the tribe divested from KPB. While that company still has the contract, “Prairie Band no longer has a stake,” the spokesperson said.\n\nThe spokesperson said Woodward is no longer with the tribe's limited liability corporation, but she declined to say whether he was terminated.\n\nThe ICE contract initially was awarded in October for $19 million for unspecified “due diligence and concept designs” for processing centers and detention centers throughout the U.S., according to a one-sentence description of the work on the federal government’s real-time contracting database. It was modified a month later to increase the payout ceiling to $29.9 million.\n\nSole-source contracts above $30 million require additional justification under federal contracting rules.\n\nTribal leaders and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security haven’t responded to detailed questions about why the firm was selected for such a big contract without having to compete for the work as federal contracting normally requires. It’s also unclear what the Tribal Council knew about the contract.\n\n“That process of internal auditing is really just beginning,” the tribal spokesperson said.\n\nHollingsworth reported from Mission, Kansas, and Goodman from Miami.",

    "description": "China warns that a massive $11.1 billion U.S. weapons sale to Taiwan could spark war, calling the island a \"powder keg\" amid rising tensions.",
    "fullText": "China denounced the United States for approving an $11.1 billion weapons package for Taiwan, warning that the deal risks turning the island into a \"powder keg\" and driving the region toward \"military confrontation and war.\"\n\nThe unprecedented sale includes 82 HIMARS launchers paired with 420 ATACMS long-range missiles, a combination that would give Taiwan new deep-strike capability across the Taiwan Strait, along with 60 self-propelled howitzers, advanced UAV systems, military software packages and anti-armor weapons.\n\nBeijing accused Taiwan’s leadership of \"seeking independence through force\" and claimed Washington is using the island to \"contain China,\" rhetoric that signals heightened tensions even as the U.S. frames the package as essential to bolstering Taiwan’s self-defense.\n\n\"The ‘Taiwan independence’ forces on the island seek independence through force and resist reunification through force, squandering the hard-earned money of the people to purchase weapons at the cost of turning Taiwan into a powder keg,\" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said.\n\nChina’s Missile Surge Puts Every Us Base In The Pacific At Risk — And The Window To Respond Is Closing\n\n\"This cannot save the doomed fate of ‘Taiwan independence’ but will only accelerate the push of the Taiwan Strait toward a dangerous situation of military confrontation and war. The U.S. support for ‘Taiwan Independence’ through arms will only end up backfiring. Using Taiwan to contain China will not succeed.\"\n\nU.S. officials have not yet detailed delivery timelines, but the sale reflects Washington’s push to accelerate Taiwan’s defenses amid growing concern over China’s military pressure campaign. The HIMARS and ATACMS combination is expected to draw particular attention from Beijing because it would allow Taiwan to target PLA staging areas, ships and infrastructure from mobile launchers, a capability China has repeatedly warned against.\n\nIn its notification to Congress, the State Department said the proposed sales would advance \"U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient’s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.\"\n\nThe department added that the weapons would \"help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance and economic progress in the region.\"\n\nUnder longstanding U.S. policy, Washington provides Taiwan with arms it deems necessary for the island’s self-defense while maintaining a \"One China\" policy and not supporting a declaration of formal independence. China argues that any enhancement of Taiwan’s defenses encourages separatism, while U.S. officials say the purpose of such sales is to preserve stability and deter conflict.\n\nHigh Stakes On The High Seas As Us, China Test Limits Of Military Power\n\nThe package now enters a 30-day congressional review period, during which lawmakers could file a resolution attempting to block it, a step Congress has never taken for an arms sale to Taiwan. Once the review period ends, contracting and production begin, a process that typically stretches over several years and contributes to a backlog that once reached $20 billion in undelivered U.S. weapons Taiwan has already purchased.\n\nChina has a track record of responding to major Taiwan arms sales with military demonstrations, including large-scale PLA drills, increased air and naval activity near the island and sanctions on U.S. defense firms. Analysts say Beijing’s sharp rhetoric suggests additional military signaling is likely, though China did not immediately announce specific countermeasures.\n\nThe latest sale marks a significant boost to Taiwan’s conventional firepower. In recent months, Beijing has stepped up pressure across the strait with near-daily PLA air and naval patrols, record incursions around the island and high-profile exercises meant to signal its ability to encircle Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan’s Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung thanked the U.S. Wednesday for its \"long-term support for regional security and Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities,\" which he said are key to deterring a conflict in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nOriginal article",

    "description": "Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released new photos from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, including some showing him with powerful people.",
    "fullText": "Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released a new batch of photos obtained from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, with some featuring tech titans Bill Gates and Sergey Brin.\n\nThe latest batch comes ahead of the December 19 deadline for the Justice Department to release its own Epstein-related files through the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Thursday's release marks the latest documents the committee has made public from the files it obtained from the Epstein estate through a subpoena earlier this year.\n\nInclusion in the photos isn't an indication of wrongdoing, and some of the pics appear to have been taken at a conference attended by other business professionals.\n\nEpstein — who killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex-trafficking charges, and who in 2008 pleaded guilty to a lesser sexual offense — has long been the subject of conspiracy theories.\n\nHe amassed a fortune worth over $600 million at the time of his death and maintained ties with some of the most powerful people in the world, including President Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Steve Bannon, and the former Prince Andrew.\n\nThe relationship between Gates and Epstein has been known for years.\n\nThey met several times — Gates has said the meetings were about philanthropy — and had ties to some of the same people. Epstein sought to establish a philanthropic organization funded by Gates and housed at JPMorgan Chase, a project that never came to fruition.\n\nEpstein has also named Boris Nikolic, a former advisor to Gates, as a backup executor for his estate.\n\nIn the past, Gates has said that he \"made a mistake in judgment\" when asked about his relationship with the pedophile, calling it \"foolish\" in an interview with the Journal this year.\n\nThe House Oversight's document dump did not say when or where the photos were taken or the identities of the women in the photos.\n\nThe billionaire has appeared in the Oversight Committee's Epstein releases before: In September, an email was released that included Epstein's 2014 schedule, which listed a \"tentative breakfast party w/Bill Gates.\"\n\nEarlier this month, a photo was released of Gates with one of Epstein's pilots.\n\nA representative for Gates did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment about the new photos.\n\nEpstein, who maintained a deep relationship with JPMorgan Chase, referred Google cofounder Sergey Brin to the bank as a client in 2004. He later connected Brin with members of the bank who could advise the tech billionaire on tax issues.\n\nSome of the photos of Brin appear to have been taken at events organized by The Edge, a now-dormant organization that arranged conferences about ideas. Epstein also attended some of these events.\n\nIn the foreground of one of the photos, Brin appears with New York Times columnist David Brooks.\n\nA representative for Brin did not immediately respond to a request for comment to Business Insider about the photographs.\n\nA spokesperson for Brooks said the journalist attended the event in 2011 \"to speak with noted and important business leaders to inform his columns.\"\n\n\"Mr. Brooks had no contact with him before or after this single attendance at a widely-attended dinner,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nSalar Kamangar, an early Google employee and later the CEO of YouTube, was also featured in Thursday's photo drop. He appeared to be photographed at the same 2011 event as Brin and Brooks.\n\nNeither Kamangar nor representatives for Google immediately responded to Business Insider's request for comment about the new photos.",

    "fullText": "A Kennedy Center board member accused the White House of lying about the organization’s “unanimous” vote to change the center’s name to the “Trump-Kennedy Center,” claiming that her dissent was censored.\n\nOn Thursday, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that the Trump-controlled board “voted unanimously” for the name change. Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), who sits on the center’s board, posted a video to X after the announcement making it clear that she was on the call when the decision was made and was muted so she could not voice her dissenting opinion.\n\n“What you may hear is that there was a unanimous vote to rename the Kennedy Center the Trump Center,” Beatty said. “Be clear, I was on that call and as I tried to push my button to voice my concern, to ask questions, and certainly not to vote in support of this, I was muted. Each time I tried to speak I was muted. Participants were not allowed to voice their concerns who were online yet it was said at the end it was a unanimous vote.”\n\nFor the record. This was not unanimous. I was muted on the call and not allowed to speak or voice my opposition to this  move. Also for the record, this was not on the agenda. This was not consensus. This is censorship. https://t.co/D1zGV7xiWV pic.twitter.com/npNvSIy6sV\n\n— Rep. Joyce Beatty (@RepBeatty) December 18, 2025\n\nShe continued: “Clearly, the Congress has a say in this. This center – the Kennedy Center – was created by the Congress. I think it is important for us to know that this is just another attempt to evade the law, and not let the people have a say.”\n\nThe president named himself a chairman of the Kennedy Center earlier this year after taking office. He hinted at the name change in October in a Truth Social post.\n\nThe proposal to change the name of the center to the Trump-Kennedy Center was also lambasted online by members of President John F. Kennedy’s family on Thursdasy.\n\n“Perhaps the board isn’t aware that the Kennedy Center is the memorial to the president of the United States, John F. Kennedy,” Tim Shriver, JFK’s nephew, wrote on X. “Would they rename the Lincoln Memorial? The Jefferson? That would be an insult to great presidents. This too is an insult to a great president.”\n\nPerhaps the board isn’t aware that the Kennedy Center is 𝗧𝗛𝗘 memorial to the president of the United States, John F. Kennedy.

Kennedy,” Shriver, JFK’s niece, wrote. “It was named in his honor. He was a man who was interested in the arts, interested in culture, interested in education, language, history.

It is beyond wild that he would think adding his name in front of President Kennedy’s name is acceptable. It is not.”\n\nJoe Kennedy III added that altering the Kennedy Center could “no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says.”\n\nIn July, House Republican’s introduced a bill that aimed to strip former President Kennedy’s name from the center, turning it into the Trump Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nThe center’s name change was part of legislation introduced by Rep. Bob Onder (R-Missouri) called the Make Entertainment Great Again (MEGA) Act. Onder noted in his bill proposal that Trump was intended “to preserve the integrity of the fine arts by ending woke programming and rebalancing the Kennedy Center’s $234 million budget” since being elected chairman.\n\nThe post Kennedy Center Board Member Says Opposition to Trump Renaming Was Censored as JFK Family Condemns Move: ‘An Insult’ appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "title": "The 12 comfiest sweatsuits for women that feel cozy and put-together",
    "description": "I did the hard work of testing the best and comfiest sweatsuits for women, and these are the winners.",
    "fullText": "If it takes 10,000 hours to become an \"expert\" at something, then I'm easily an expert at wearing sweatsuits. I tomy career fully remote five years ago, I've amassed no less than 22 sweatsuits which comprise my daily uniform. The best matching sweatsuits I've tried look more put together than separates, so I can transition from my home office to running errands and back again without any outfit changes.\n\nMy favorite sweatsuit comes from Spanx (more specifically, the Air Essentials Wide-Leg Pants and Half-Zip Sweatshirt). It's made with a lightweight, luxurious-feeling fabric (though I found the Anrabess Women's 2-Piece Sweatsuit to be a solid alternative at a fraction of the price). I'm also a huge fan of Gap's VintageSoft Boyfriend Joggers and Raglan Sweatshirt. They're warm, cozy, and come in tons of fun colors (which is why I bought three!).\n\nI remember the first time I put on Spanx's AirEssentials sweatsuit and quickly understood the hype (our own editors and Oprah are big fans). The fabric felt luxurious, stretchy and super soft. It remains one of the comfiest things I've ever had on my body.\n\nThough the pants come in petite and long inseams, Spanx recommends the regular length for someone 5-foot-7. So I selected the Wide-Leg Pants in a size Medium, with a Half-Zip sweatshirt in a size Small. Both fit me impeccably.\n\nI wear the whole set with crisp, white sneakers and oversized sunglasses, and the finished look is downright fancy. That's a feeling I usually find difficult to achieve in sweats. Another little bonus is that the fabric offers UPF 50+ protection.\n\n\"What sets this sweater apart is its oversized silhouette, which lends it a more intentional, wearable shape than any other sweatshirt. It drapes beautifully, and the ribbed hem and banded cuffs add just enough structure to keep it from feeling boxy. Though the crewneck sweater that I'm wearing above is sold out, there's still lots of stock in the V-neck version.\n\nGap's CashSoft Boot Sweater Pants are perhaps my favorite piece in the whole CashSoft line. The boot-cut silhouette is the real differentiator here: instead of the straight or jogger shape most sweat pants default to, this cut elongates the leg and balances out bulkier winter tops. It gives the pants a more \"finished\" look, almost like a soft-knit version of trousers. Plus, it helps that these are available in both petite and tall lengths so that you can get the perfect fit.\n\nAs someone who has always switched between leggings, jeans, and sweatpants for cozy weekend days, this pant beats all of them in comfort, warmth, and style. I'm planning to purchase it in both black and white, so I can pair it with almost anything.\" —Samantha Crozier, style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nRead \n\n\"These are the ultimate cold weather sweatpants. They feel so warm and cozy, and the fleece interior is baby soft. Aesthetically inspired by track pants, the Beyond Yoga sweats are sporty chic, with a cute split hem at the bottom is a cute sporty touch and retro contrast piping trim down the side of the legs. While the fit is somewhat relaxed, the pants are form-fitting, with a mid-rise waist and an ever-so-slight flare. I'm not normally a matching-set girlie, but I felt very cool wearing these with the matching LuxeFleece Piper Oversized Sweatshirt.\" — Maria Yagoda, freelance writer, Insider Reviews\n\nOther styles from Beyond Yoga come in a wider size range. Learn \n\nThough the design on this Gap pullover and jogger set is classic, the quality is top-notch. The fabric is cozy and warm, though not overly so. The fit is roomy but not oversized, making it perfect for layering. I love that the top and bottom are sold separately and both come in three lengths.\n\nIf I truly love something in my wardrobe, I'm the type of person who will buy two. Rarely, though, do I buy three of a kind, but I did with this sweatsuit because I reached for it so often. (Actually, it's four if you count the set I gifted my sister for Christmas.) It's easy to load up because there are lots of vibrant and neutral colors to choose from, and Gap is regularly adding new ones to the mix.\n\nThis is Amazon's number one best-seller in women's tracksuits for good reason. The stretchy, silky-soft, medium-weight fabric is much more expensive-looking than I anticipated. I chose a rich, dark brown color called Coffee. When I opened the zippered plastic bag it came in, it was exactly the hue I expected. I also love that the top looks equally stylish with leggings or jeans.\n\nStill, I should note that this is sold as a set, so it's not ideal for people who (like me) size differently in tops and bottoms. Still, if you're looking for a budget-friendly option that looks luxe, it's hard to beat this price.\n\nRead \n\nI'm a long-time fan of Vuori's elevated athleisure, and I regularly pack items from the brand when I'm traveling. Their Restore fleece collection might be my favorite yet. The French terry fabric is nice and warm without feeling too heavy. I appreciate that the hoodie has a half zip, making it easier to pull over my head without messing up my hair and allowing me to adjust the warmth. The bottoms have multiple design details that set them apart from your basic sweatpants: a pintuck down the front, exposed ties and a stitched logo on the back.\n\nI chose the Chia colorway, which is a versatile mauvy-brown. The fit is true to size with a slightly oversized silhouette that is roomy but not baggy. I just wish there were length options for the joggers like there are with the Performance joggers I love so much.\n\nAs far as textiles are concerned, Buck Mason stands above the competition. Home to some of our favorite basic t-shirts, the brand makes equally notable athleisure. The 100% cotton jersey sweats are designed to retain their shape, despite washing or napping in them. They come pre-washed, too, giving them a lived-in feel from the first wear (this time it was at the nail salon, where I immediately got a compliment). The mid-weight fabric is airy yet substantial — a perfect combination for comfort.\n\nI tend to be in-between size, so I went up in these but wished I had sized down instead. The fit is generously oversized. Still, they look more polished than your typical sweats, especially the mockneck top.\n\nAthleta makes my favorite work pants that feel like sweatpants. Recently, I sampled their Seasoft sweats, and (no surprise here) I was thoroughly pleased.\n\nThis lightweight Athleta sweatsuit is great for warmer months thanks to a breathable, machine-washable fabric and breezy silhouette. While it's equally great for lounging or running errands, this would definitely be the sweatsuit I choose for sportier activities, like a long walk outdoors. It's also ideal for travel since the material is wrinkle-resistant. I'm especially enamored with the quarter-zip top, which has stylish ribbed detailing around the zipper. I also love that the bottom hem has a drawcord to adjust the fit.\n\n\"This $220 sweatsuit is the best investment I've made as a working mom. I can do school drop-off without having to get fully dressed,\" writes deputy editor Conz Preti in her review of the pima cotton outfit sold as a two-piece set. \"I got the lavender color set that has an accent of red on the sleeves. The cotton is super soft and light, and the look is relaxed — which I strive to be in the mornings rushing out the door.\n\n\"I can wear the sweatsuit with sneakers or rain boots, and as the days get colder, I can easily throw a jacket on top. Because of the relaxed look, I can wear anything underneath, like a tee or a tank top. I've gotten lots of compliments from other moms at school, and I'm always happy to share my secret.\"\n\nNothing compares to being enveloped in an extra oversized sweatsuit. Lululemon's oversized Scuba set delivers on that front. Still, I don't feel like I'm swimming in it, thanks to the sweatshirt's cropped waist. My favorite details are the sweatshirt's gold zipper and large stitched logo on the hood. They elevate it from a typical sweatshirt, making me more inclined to wear it out when I'm running errands.\n\nI was a little unsure of what size to pick in the top since the sizes are grouped XS/S, M/L and XL/XXL. I'm usually between a small and a medium, so I sized up to M/L, but in retrospect, I would have been happier with the XS/S. I mistakenly sized up in the bottoms, too, but shouldn't have due to the already oversized fit.\n\nOn the coldest days, I reach for a sweatsuit from Athleta's Forever Fleece collection — its warmth is unrivaled. The plush fleece has a soft, brushed interior that has the perfect amount of stretch for comfort. Still, it's adequately breathable.\n\nThe sweatshirt is a generous 28 inches long, which adds warmth and lets it pair well with leggings. Both the half-zip sweatshirt and the high-rise joggers are liberally oversized, which works well if you plan on layering clothes underneath. If I had to do it over, I might have preferred to size down, though.\n\nIf you haven't heard of Popflex, you've certainly heard of one highly notable fan: Taylor Swift. It's been heavily speculated that the \"lilac short skirt\" Swift sings about in \"imgonnagetyouback\" is the Popflex Pirouette Skirt, so we simply had to check out the inclusive activewear brand for ourselves.\n\nOne of our favorite pieces is this ingeniously designed zipped hoodie, which pairs perfectly with these versatile sweats with a high- or low-rise waist depending on how you roll them.\n\n\"The hoodie is more fitted at the hips than at the waist, which produces a bubbled-over look rather than hanging straight down like most zip hoodies. The sleeves are similarly bubbled at the wrists, so the look is oversized but still fitted. I love the slightly off-the-shoulder opening and the materials are supersoft,\" writes deputy editor Lauren Savoie. \"The 1X/3X is generously sized; I usually wear a 3X and I felt like I had plenty of extra room in the hoodie.\"\n\nRead our full Popflex review to learn more about our favorite styles.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

    "description": "The Coldplay \"kiss cam\" led to harassment for Kristin Cabot, the woman in the video, she says. That should make us all feel bad about the internet.",
    "fullText": "I still feel bad about watching the Coldplay \"kiss cam\" video.\n\nAfter the woman who was caught in the embarrassing moment spoke this week about harassment she endured when the video went viral over the summer … well, I think we should all feel bad.\n\nThis wasn't any of our business. And our reaction to the video says a lot more about us, and about online culture, than it could ever say about the people who were filmed embracing.\n\nI think we can agree that a potential romance between a CEO and an underling isn't appropriate. But the extreme reactions to the video — being doxxed, getting 500 to 600 calls a day, and 50 to 60 death threats, she told The New York Times — weren't about workplace conduct or potential relationship transgressions.\n\nKristin Cabot also spoke to the Times of London this week. She told the newspaper that she might have understood all the attention had she been famous. \"But I'm not some celebrity, I'm just a mom from New Hampshire,\" she told the newspaper. \"Even if I did have an affair, it's not anybody's business.\"\n\nExactly. Everyone, chill. Don't find some random person on the internet and call them at home and yell at them. Come on.\n\nWhen it comes to the idea of the internet doxxing and harassing people, we imagine something like 4chan, or some anonymous sinister force victimizing some innocent person for political or ideological reasons. But what Cabot is describing isn't 4chan trolls. It's people at her local grocery store, and people willing to say mean things using their real names and faces.\n\nThere's a long history of \"the internet\" grabbing onto some viral moment with a stranger and hanging them out to dry. Think of \"West Elm Caleb,\" a man whom several women on TikTok realized they had all met on dating apps. Or \"Couch Guy,\" a young man who TikTok was convinced was cheating on his girlfriend in a viral video. Online mobs doxxed and harassed them in real life.\n\nWhat always felt off to me about the \"kiss cam\" story was that, sure, it was a funny little viral moment. Haha. I watched it and thought it was amusing for a second. But the way it blew up got weird. It became a big national news story. (We covered it at Business Insider, and I wrote about it, too.) It should've been a gag for 2 hours; instead, it made headlines for days.\n\nWe should feel bad that this got so out of control! Yes, I laughed at the video. No, I didn't feel compelled to use facial recognition software to identify the people in it, nor did I tweet at them or call them at home. But some jerks actually did that! And my harmless chuckling eventually led to a cascade of real-world harm to someone who didn't live a public life and whose crime was a dismissible case of misdemeanor canoodling.\n\nIn the interview with The New York Times, Cabot talks about how she's taken accountability for her actions and accepted the consequences of losing her job. We, the internet mob, should do the same: take accountability for being a small part of something that snowballed way out of control.\n\nIf you find yourself fiending for a healthy outlet for messy gossip and drama that you can yell about online, there is an endless buffet for you awaiting on Bravo and ESPN. Let 2026 find you at peace.",

    "fullText": "Erebor Bank, Palmer Luckey's finance startup backed by some of the biggest names in tech, got one step closer to launching after it cleared another key federal hurdle this week.\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. approved Erebor on December 16 with conditions: The bank is subject to a strict capitalization requirement and must have investors ready to provide more funding if called upon.\n\nThe bank still requires final approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. It received preliminary approval from the OCC in October.\n\nTodd Baker, a senior fellow at Columbia University and a consultant to fintech companies who isn't involved with Erebor, said in an email that he would expect Erebor to get approval to open in early 2026.\n\nBaker said in an email that one of the FDIC's requirements — that the bank invoke a capital-call agreement that would require unnamed parties to chip in more cash if certain triggers occur — is \"highly unusual\" but \"entirely appropriate given the expectation that the bank will be taking on significant risks associated with its tech and crypto-focused business plan.\"\n\nA lawyer listed in regulatory documents as an Erebor spokesperson didn't reply to a comment request.\n\nWith funding from Joe Lonsdale and Peter Thiel, Erebor's valuation was reported to be about $2 billion earlier this year. Regulatory documents showed that the bank has brought on talent from both Luckey's tech circles as well as bank and bank-regulatory circles; earlier this month, a cryptocurrency event featured remarks by Erebor's Suzanne Dannheim, a former Goldman Sachs employee.\n\nErebor's founding team set out an ambitious timeline in its pitch to investors. The bank stressed founder Palmer Luckey's \"political network\" — he has contributed large sums to President Donald Trump and other Republican organizations — as a key asset.\n\nWith this recent round of regulatory approval, it may come close to meeting its proposed timeline.\n\nThe FDIC approval process kicked off on July 28, which means it received a green light in roughly 5 months. The median application processed last year took over eight months.\n\nSeveral other new bank applications emphasizing digital services are pending with the OCC and other regulators.\n\nMichele Alt, a bank-licensing consultant, said Erebor's quick turnaround at the FDIC is cause for celebration.\n\n\"The prior average was indicative of an unnecessarily slow-moving process and highly risk averse bureaucracy,\" she said in an email to Business Insider. \"I'm delighted to see more efficient processing of bank charter applications.\"",

    "fullText": "Sky TV has emerged as one of the leading television providers in the UK. While any long-term plan adds up over time, the best Sky TV deals and plans can keep your spending to a minimum.\n\nWe've rounded up some of the best Sky TV deals and plans that are active at the time of writing. These plans feature Sky Stream, which means that you can stream your viewing options over WiFi without any extra hardware. Some deals, like Essential TV, offer you Sky's lowest ever price, while other plans are just handy bundles. All options throw in access to ad-supported Netflix and Discovery Plus.\n\nJust keep in mind that most Sky plans and services are available through long-term contracts (usually 24-month commitments), so it's important to read the fine print before signing up. Sky's website notes that prices may change during the 24-month contract. Most deals only apply to new Sky TV customers.\n\nSky TV also offers a \"build your own\" option, with plans starting at £15/month, and other packages that require a satellite dish or other equipment. If you'd prefer to browse plans at your own leisure, you can head directly to Sky TV's deals page.\n\nSky TV is available across a variety of devices, so you're not just confined to watching on your TV at home. The Sky Go app, for on-the-go streaming, is available on phones, tablets, and laptops.\n\nAll the Sky TV plans we've highlighted include one of the two base packs, either Sky Essential or Sky Ultimate. Sky Essential includes Sky Atlantic (plus Netflix and Discovery Plus) and over 100 other channels. Sky Ultimate carries everything found in Sky Essential, in addition to more than 35 premium channels (such as Sky Max and Sky Witness).\n\nSky also has several deals when you bundle broadband and TV. The broadband deals offer anywhere from 150 to 300 Mbps full fibre broadband with Sky Essential or Sky Ultimate TV (plus other add-ons, such as Sky Sports or Sky Cinema). Prices range from £35 to £55 a month.\n\nA broadband connection is a necessity for both the Sky Stream puck and Sky Glass TV. Sky recommends a minimum speed of 25Mbps. This minimum requirement could change depending on your desired package. Watching in UHD or adding an extra Sky Stream puck device will bring that minimum up to at least 30Mbps.\n\nYou can explore a full roundup of current deals on the Sky website.

In January, the Supreme Court ruled against TikTok and upheld the divest-or-ban law.\n\nSince then, TikTok has been facing a looming deadline to find a US buyer. The app's future remained in limbo for months as the White House repeatedly extended the deadline and administration officials sought to work out a deal.\n\nIn September, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that approved the sale of TikTok's US operation for around $14 billion.\n\nTrump said at the time that Oracle and Larry Ellison would be part of the deal, and Michael Dell and Rupert Murdoch may also be involved.

    "description": "Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot says a 15-year financial guarantee from Google was the key to unlocking billions in project financing from JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.",
    "fullText": "The \"crypto miner\" label is becoming a relic of the past for Hut 8 (HUT).\n\nIn a move that signals a massive strategic shift, Hut 8 announced a $7 billion deal to build a data center complex in Louisiana for Anthropic (ANTH.PVT). The move effectively trades the volatility of bitcoin (BTC-USD) for the high-margin stability of AI infrastructure.\n\n\"We think that the value of energy will continue to go up, and so for us, we [had] to be patient and figure out what was a fair deal that added value to our customers, but that drove a strong return to our shareholders,\" Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid.\n\nThe market is rewarding the transformation. The energy infrastructure company's stock surged roughly 20% on Wednesday following the announcement as investors cheered its potential to secure blue-chip partners in a crowded field.\n\nBeyond the one-day pop, the stock has been a standout in the mining-to-AI pivot, fueled by the company's deep energy assets and its strategic partnership with American Bitcoin (ABTC), a Trump family enterprise in which Hut 8 holds a 60% stake. Year to date, Hut 8 stock is up 90%.\n\nThe linchpin of the Louisiana project is a financial guarantee from Google (GOOG, GOOGL), which guarantees payments of the 15-year lease if Fluidstack, an AI cloud infrastructure provider, cannot meet them. The deal secures 245 megawatts (MW) of capacity, with the possibility to scale up to 2,300 MW within that timeframe — a move that could swell the total lease value to $17.7 billion.\n\n\"We're very excited because it's the first domino to fall,\" Genoot said. \"If we're able to continue to scale and build up to that full strategic partnership on 2,300 MW, we see a lot of growth upside for the company and the deal overall.\"\n\nThe creditworthiness was the key. Genoot noted that without Google's involvement, securing project financing from titans like JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) at favorable rates would have been nearly impossible.\n\nHe added that Google has a \"strong core business,\" including diversified cash flows from Search, YouTube, and cloud services, making the tech giant's pledge the ultimate security for a 15-year infrastructure play.\n\nHowever, securing the money is only half the battle. Competitors have seen their stocks hammered due to construction delays. Genoot claims Hut 8 has de-risked the execution side, partly by issuing a \"conservative delivery schedule\" and tapping local labor.\n\nThe company has turned to established industrial partners, including Jacobs Engineering for design and local contractors like Cajun Electric for electrical services. By scheduling the first data hall delivery for Q2 2027, Genoot said the company is avoiding the \"crunch\" of unrealistic timelines that has plagued the sector.",

    "description": "People were outraged by the president's recent use of this particular expression. Experts in political science and mental health say the term tells quite the story.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump recently leveled one of his commonly used terms in a statement attacking iconic actor and director Rob Reiner shortly after he and his wife, Michele Singer, were found dead at their home on Sunday.\n\nThe president took to his Truth Social platform on Monday to seize on the opportunity to slam Rob Reiner, who was a critic of Trump, and for baselessly attributing the Hollywood filmmaker’s death to “Trump Derangement Syndrome” — a phrase Trump and his supporters often use to attack those who criticize the president, his policies and his rhetoric.\n\nLife: Psychologists React To THAT Post From Trump About Rob Reiner's Death\n\n“Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS,” Trump wrote in part on the social media platform.\n\nTrump’s vile post about Reiner garnered wide condemnation, with many on social media describinghis remarks as“disgusting.” Rocker Jack White took to Instagram to slam the president, writing: “Trump you disgusting, vile, egomaniac, loser, child. Neither he nor any one of his followers can defend this gross, horrible insult to a beautiful artist who gave the world so much.”\n\nThe president also garnered a rare rebuke from many MAGA supporters and a number of the president’s most loyal advocates. He was further criticized when he doubled down on his attacks on Reiner while speaking to reporters at the Oval Office hours later.\n\nThe concept of a so-called “derangement syndrome” has been used against critics of past presidents before. But Trump has a history of frequently using the phrase against his naysayers himself. He had also used the expression against those who opposed him during his first term as president.\n\nLife: How To Do That 'Defying Gravity' Riff Without Murdering Your Voice\n\nAlexandra Cromer, a licensed professional counselor with Thriveworks, believes that Trump’s habit of leveling the phrase “Trump Derangement Syndrome” reveals a lot about his leadership style.\n\n“It reveals that he is not a leader that values, welcomes, or is willing to receive feedback,” she told HuffPost. “This also is a behavior pattern that we see in people with narcissistic tendencies; projection of perceived criticism onto someone else.”\n\nCromer explained that by Trump calling his critics “deranged,” he’s essentially seeking to undermine “the authenticity of the feedback.”\n\n“This reveals that his leadership style is very rigid and very one-dimensional. He is the one to give directions and all others must comply,” she said. “This is a tremendously unhealthy way to receive criticism or any other form of feedback. Psychologically, we know that feedback is critical to not only growth [and] prosperity, but overall health and wellness.”\n\nLife: The Funniest Posts From Women This Week (Dec. 6-12)\n\nShe later continued, “shutting down criticism by engaging in stereotyping and blaming of the source can also be viewed as abusive behavior — that is, behavior that attempts to inflict psychological harm and maintain power structures.”\n\nHallie Kritsas, a licensed mental health counselor and therapist with Thriveworks who specializes in self-esteem, workplace issues and anxiety, told HuffPost that she believes the term “Trump Derangement Syndrome” is “polarizing and emotionally activating.”\n\n“It comes across as a threat and will more than likely increase stress and divide groups in two different ones versus unifying them,” she said.\n\nJacob Neiheisel, associate professor of political science at the University at Buffalo College of Arts and Sciences, told HuffPost that he thinks Trump’s frequent use of the phrase is “meant to be dismissive of his opposition” and intended to “give his followers cover for dismissing similar criticisms that they might hear.”\n\nLife: The Most Popular Dog Names Of 2025\n\n“I think his use of the term reflects his deep-seated disdain for dissent,” he said. “Trump’s leadership style is certainly not one that is welcoming of a ‘team of rivals’ type of approach, but rather one that demands loyalty and a willingness to do political combat on his behalf.”\n\nNeiheisel thinks that the “Trump Derangement Syndrome” phrase has caught on with so many Trump supporters because it “allows them to adopt a similar orientation toward dissent in their own social environments.”\n\n“Simply dismissing the opposition as having a form of mental illness allows them to protect their own attitudes and beliefs, inoculating them against any negativity directed toward Trump,” he added.\n\nNeiheisel thinks that Trump’s attack on Reiner after his death hit “a new low.”\n\nLife: We Asked Actual Historians About Trump's New Plaques — And They Have THOUGHTS\n\n“Republicans had the moral high ground in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s murder and were able to use the negative things said about Kirk after his death to attack Democrats,” he said. “With Trump’s response, that high ground is gone. I think that’s why we saw a number of Republicans condemning Trump’s remarks.”\n\nKritsas believes that Trump’s statements about the iconic director “violated what some might view as a time to grieve and have decency in a moment of loss.”\n\nCromer said that Trump’s harsh words for Reiner was likely particularly upsetting to so many people because the filmmaker was a “universally liked person.”\n\n“While Rob was not a perfect person (because nobody is), he demonstrated consistent prosocial behavior patterns and centered his personal values at the forefront of his personal and professional life,” she said.\n\n“Further, Trump’s remarks state a belief that someone was murdered because they didn’t like Trump; an assertion that can be viewed as narcissistic by inserting himself into a situation that had nothing to do with him in any contextual way,” she continued.\n\nCromer later added that overall, Trump’s remarks about Reiner “communicates a lack of respect for psychological and personal boundaries for those affected by this incident.”\n\nMedical Examiner Report States Rob And Michele Reiner’s Cause Of Death\n\n2 Of Rob Reiner's Children Release Statement On Parents' Deaths\n\nTrump Blames Rob Reiner For His Own Death In Truth Social Post",

    "fullText": "Americans working with a financial advisor average $132,000 in retirement savings, versus $62,000 for those without one.\n\nThose with advisors plan to retire at 64 compared to 66 for non-advised savers.\n\nAdvised savers are more likely to have emergency funds and long-term plans accounting for economic volatility.\n\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nDoubling your retirement savings may sound like a dream scenario, especially since far too many Americans end up with way less money than they need to support themselves in their 401(k)s, IRAs, and other retirement investment accounts.   In reality, though, ending up with twice as much as the average American doesn't have to be as hard as it seems and it doesn't necessarily require you to make a huge income or to sacrifice all fun spending.\n\nInstead, there's one really simple factor that can give you the best chance of doubling your retirement savings. Unfortunately, many Americans don't know what it is and aren't doing it. You don't have to be one of those Americans. Instead, here's what you need to do to build a big nest egg that beats the average.\n\nNorthwestern Mutual's 2024 Planning and Progress study revealed the simple step that Americans have taken to double their retirement savings. According to the research, those who work with a financial advisor have around twice the retirement investment account balances compared to people who try to manage their retirement investing all on their own with no professional advice.\n\nThe research showed that those who have a financial advisor guiding them have around $132,000 in retirement savings, compared with $62,000 among those with no advisor. Those who have an advisor were also planning to retire at a much younger age -- 64, versus 66 for those who have no advisor assisting them. Being able to retire at a younger age is within reach when you have twice the money in your retirement plan, so this is not a surprise.\n\nIt's not just that people working with an advisor were richer, either. Those who had help with managing their money were significantly more likely to have a long-term plan in place that takes economic ups and downs into account. They were also more likely to have emergency savings that can help keep them out of debt and that makes investing for retirement possible, and they were much more likely to feel financially secure.",

    "title": "SLO County won’t cap housing growth across county anymore — except in one town",
    "description": "The San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors’ decision will allow for a maximum of 25 new homes in one unincorporated town next year.",
    "fullText": "Parts of San Luis Obispo County are set to see the number of allowed housing units increase next year — and the infamously building-averse Los Osos is in line to allow more homes.\n\nOn Tuesday, the San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors held a hearing on growth rate allocations for unincorporated parts of the county, which dictate the maximum number of home permits that can be issued each year.\n\nDuring the meeting, county long range planner Dominic Delporto said in 2025, builders only used around 11% of the maximum countywide dwelling unit allocation, or 112 dwelling units requested out of 1,036 allowed.\n\nOn a more local level, the Nipomo Mesa Water Conservation Area saw 27% of its 134-unit maximum allocation utilized, according to the staff report. Conversely, Los Osos’ 25-dwelling unit allocation went unfilled because though several applications were filed, they were still in the use permit process, long-range planning division manager Corey Hahn said.\n\nAfter receiving a review of countywide dwelling unit allocations for 2025, the board turned its attention to the next year and the changes recommended by staff — namely, the elimination of growth rate limits for the Nipomo Mesa and across the county.\n\nLos Osos, which was under a building moratorium from 1988 to October 2024, was the only exception to the removal of growth rate limits.\n\nLos Osos Community Services District board member Chuck Cesena said the CSD, Golden State Water Co. and S&T Mutual Water Co. — the three water purveyors who tap into the Los Osos Groundwater Basin — found the county staff’s justification for an 0.4% growth rate “unpersuasive.”\n\n“The (Basin Management Committee) also noted the uncertainties in the transient model, but recognized correctly that the model uncertainty implies the impacts may be underestimated as well as overestimated,” Cesena said. “Said another way, uncertainty isn’t a green light, it’s a warning sign.”\n\nDelparto said the county’s local coastal program requires a 1% growth cap for Los Osos, but the annual growth rate is to be established based on reviews of groundwater data, the true limiting factor for the community.\n\nBut the sources of groundwater data that the county relies on weren’t all in agreement on how much the community allows to grow.\n\nWhile the Los Osos Basin Management Committee’s “transient model — which simulates groundwater levels and seawater intrusion in the basin using existing data — recommended that the county adopt a 0% growth rate for Los Osos for 2026, county groundwater sustainability director Blaine Reely said the Board should adopt a growth rate of 0.4%, maintaining the previous year’s maximum of 25 new dwelling units.\n\nThat 0.4% growth rate would essentially be a “rerun” of the current year’s allocation, though of course that’s no guarantee that the allocations will be filled, Hahn said.\n\nLos Osos Community Services District general manager Ron Munds said as data on the health of the Los Osos Groundwater Basin is somewhat spotty — and won’t have a five-year average for water levels established until 2028 — proceeding with caution in expanding the number of allocated dwelling units is the best practice.\n\nSeawater intrusion continues to be an issue for the basin, and must be fully accounted for in any talks of expanding housing in Los Osos — something Munds said he didn’t feel was done in the county staff’s recommended amendment.\n\nMunds said while staff such as Reely may have an idea of what the right amount of water pumping should look like, “they do not know the operational challenges we face on a daily basis, which include water quality issues like seawater intrusion, nitrate contamination, emerging contaminants like PFAS, but also the pumping distribution and constraints that we are trying to implement to maximize the quantity of water that we can pump on any given day to the community.”\n\n“The rate of intrusion is what needs to be steady and confirmed to take the cloud of uncertainty, which I feel is a distraction in this conversation today, out of the discussion,” Munds said. “On that note, one of the county consultants stated that there’s ample time to react to the uncertainty, which I believe is an irresponsible comment and approach when it comes to protecting our community’s only water supply.”\n\nDespite the Los Osos CSD’s warnings of overtapping the basin, the Board voted 4-1 to approve the staff’s amendment, with Supervisor Jimmy Paulding the sole “no” vote, removing growth caps for the unincorporated parts of the county save for Los Osos’ 0.4% cap.\n\nSupervisor Bruce Gibson argued that Los Osos’ cap was a “conservative response” to the concerns voiced by the Los Osos CSD.\n\nAccording to the county staff’s presentation, the 0.4% growth rate for next year had already been reduced from 0.6% to 0.4% to try to address these concerns, though a 0.8% growth rate is prescribed for 2027.\n\nStarting in 2028 and beyond, growth rates can be established based on a five-year rolling average that is currently in the data collection stage, according to the staff report.\n\n“We could certainly justify 0.6% as per the growth management ordinance that’s set out, but keeping the growth rate at 0.4% so we can continue the efforts to exercise the transient model for some different scenarios is more than protective of the groundwater,” Gibson said.\n\nGibson said he supported eliminating the growth cap in the rest of unincorporated San Luis Obispo County because the number of permit requests haven’t approached the cap in recent years.\n\nPaulding said he voted against the growth rate changes because he couldn’t support the elimination of growth caps for the Nipomo Mesa Water Conservation Area.\n\n“It’s no secret that the bulk of the housing that we’re seeing in the unincorporated areas in San Luis Obispo County is occurring in the community of Nipomo,” Paulding said. “This growth management ordinance only looks at when a building permit is processed — it’s not looking at what the number of units in the overall pipeline are based on land use approvals, so it doesn’t give us a good tool to actually measure what’s coming and whether or not we have the infrastructure, resources and services to support that growth.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Speaker Mike Johnson had a ready-made refrain when asked why Republicans weren't moving to extend federal health care subsidies: their party wanted to help 100% of Americans with their costs, not just the 7% of Americans enrolled in Affordable Care Act plans.\n\nBut not 100% of his conference agreed.\n\nA rare revolt from the moderate wing of the party has upended Johnson's plans. Four Republicans this week signed onto a Democratic discharge petition that guarantees that the House will vote on extending the ACA subsidies sometime in January, with Republican leaders now powerless to stop it.\n\nFor Democrats, it was vindication of a months-long strategy, starting with the government shutdown in the fall, that pushed the expiration of the ACA support to the forefront of politics. Republicans from competitive districts most at risk of losing their seats in next year's midterms felt the political pressure as they heard from constituents about their skyrocketing premiums.\n\n“Nothing has changed with House Republican leadership, but something has changed within their own ranks,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar, chair of the House Democratic Caucus.\n\nFlanked by his caucus Thursday on the Capitol steps, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries demanded that Johnson allow a vote on the three-year extension of ACA subsidies before lawmakers leave for the holidays: “Not tomorrow. Not next week. Not next year. Today.”\n\nJohnson refused, saying it will “be on the floor that first week of January when we return.”\n\nLawmakers prepare to leave in limbo\n\nThe impasse left lawmakers with a cliffhanger as they headed home for the holiday break. Republican leaders now face growing pressure to appease centrist members who are threatening to side with Democrats to approve an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies for three years.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune has to confront the issue as well. Any ACA bill clearing the House would simply push the fight to the Senate, which has already rejected a three-year extension.\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has been meeting and discussing possible compromise bills that would extend the subsidies but put new limitations on them. But they would not consider anything until January.\n\nThune told reporters Thursday that a three-year extension of “a failed program that’s rife with fraud, waste and abuse is not happening.”\n\nYet Republican leaders in both chambers have not offered a plan that fully addresses members’ concerns about the sharp insurance cost increases many Americans are expected to face in 2026 and potentially beyond.\n\nThe White House has been engaged in discussions about the healthcare proposals but has largely allowed House Republicans to sort out their internal divisions and coalesce around a plan on their own, according to a senior administration official involved in the talks who was granted anonymity to discuss private discussions.\n\nHouse Republicans on Wednesday passed a 100-plus-page health care package centered on long-standing GOP priorities, including expanding coverage options for small businesses and the self-employed. The bill would also rein in pharmacy benefit managers — middlemen that manage drug costs and process insurance claims.\n\nJohnson touted the measure as “a bigger and better and more important thing for 100% of Americans, not just 7% of Americans.” But some Republicans who face tough reelection bids remain fixated on the looming spike in ACA costs.\n\nThe holidays provide Johnson with a brief window to try to persuade moderates to abandon the effort. The discharge petition froze once it reached the 218-signature threshold, meaning that while only four Republicans have publicly signed on, more may be willing to support the Democratic bill.\n\nRep. Ryan Mackenzie, one of the four Republicans who signed the Democratic petition, said it has “generated more conversations” and that “hopefully over the next three weeks, we will actually see some changes in some bipartisan efforts that actually can generate a meaningful vote that gets 218 in the House and 60 in the Senate.”\n\n“I think allowing a vote is critically important,” Mackenzie said. “I think everybody should be able to put up their votes on the board, and they should be able to let everybody in the American public see how they voted on these individual issues.”\n\nLeader Jeffries' waiting game pays off\n\nFor months, Jeffries refused to support a one-year extension of ACA subsidies that a bipartisan group of lawmakers had been pursuing, dismissing it as a “non-starter” and “a laughable proposition.”\n\nInstead, he held firm on a three-year extension with no income caps or cost offsets. That strategy paid off, as GOP moderates were forced to move in his direction when Johnson refused to allow any vote on an ACA extension.\n\nJeffries has faced criticism this year from progressive members of his caucus and grassroots groups who have urged him to push back more forcefully against Trump and Republicans. But on Thursday, much of the party rallied behind him on the Capitol steps, with several lawmakers praising his approach.\n\n“As Leader Jeffries has said all along, this is the only real plan on the table,” said Aguilar.\n\nStill, while Democrats have secured a vote, insurance costs for millions are set to rise next year, and passage of a three-year ACA subsidies extension remains a long shot even if it does pass the House. Senate Republicans have already rejected the three-year extension, but some GOP senators who are open to a deal on the subsidies said a House vote could provide momentum.\n\n“We could have a vehicle — if we could get Republicans and Democrats behind it — then we could send it back,” said GOP Sen. Thom Tillis, adding that it “means that there’s still a chance.”\n\nFor Democrats, the fight has also allowed them to unify around a message they believe could prove potent on the campaign trail.\n\n“The Republican health care crisis is unacceptable, unconscionable, and un-American,” Jeffries said.\n\nThe decision by four Republicans to break with party leadership and join Democrats is only the latest sign of discontent in the narrowly divided House.\n\nJohnson has argued that the criticism directed at his leadership — and lawmakers repeatedly bypassing leadership to force votes — is inevitable given the slim GOP majority. He said he lacks the advantages of a large majority, where “the speaker had a long stick that he would administer punishment.”\n\n“I don’t have that, because we have a small margin,” he said. Of the ACA extensions, Johnson said leadership had “talked about it at length” with GOP moderates, describing the conversations as “some intense fellowship.”\n\n“Everybody’s in good spirits now and everybody understands what’s happening,” he added.\n\nSome GOP members, however, don’t appear to share that assessment. There was lingering discontent as lawmakers headed home for the holidays.\n\n“I don't know how we did not vote on a good bipartisan extension,” said GOP Rep. Don Bacon, adding that Democrats will use the health care issue “like a sledgehammer” on the campaign trail.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., insisted that Republicans are finishing the year “as united as we've ever been.”\n\n“We set out on a course to do big things, not little things, and that means we’re going to have some differences along the way.”",

    "fullText": "Concerns are growing about how polluted water from roadways is affecting not just the environment but human populations as well.\n\nIn a study published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology Letters, researchers out of the Guangdong Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution and Health took a closer look at tiny particles shed from car tires and the toxic chemicals that they can release over time.\n\nOver the course of the study, 150 urine samples were collected from three different populations across South China. The participants included adults, children, and pregnant women.\n\nThe team discovered that the chemical 6PPD and its toxic byproduct, 6PPD-quinone, were common pollutants in the urine of those tested. In fact, the chemicals were detected in 60-100% of samples.\n\nWhile the researchers acknowledged that both 6PPD and 6PPD-quinone were prevalent in the environment, they noted that there was a lack of studies to determine if these harmful chemicals were making their way inside humans. Since the chemicals are known to be highly toxic to aquatic animals, there are concerns that humans could face similar dangers.\n\nAccording to NOAA Fisheries, scientists developed a test to detect 6PPD-quinone in fish, shellfish, and other marine mammals. They hope that the tool will allow them to track the chemical's movement and buildup in food webs. This could lead to a better understanding of its risks to ecosystems and better stormwater management systems.\n\nIn a study published in Environmental Research, scientists pointed to tire particles as the leading contributor to microplastic pollution. These tiny particles derived from fossil fuels have been linked to a number of severe health issues, including an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurological disorders.\n\nHenry Obanya, a researcher from the University of Portsmouth and lead author of the study, detailed the team's findings in an essay for The Conversation, pushing for the reclassification of harmful chemicals such as 6PPD and 6PPD-quinone.\n\n\"We urgently need to classify tire particles as a unique pollution category,\" Obanya wrote. He noted that because of the array of chemicals used to create tires, we may not know the true impact of the contamination in our bodies until more research is conducted.\n\n\"Tire particles tend to be made from a complex mix of synthetic and natural rubbers, along with hundreds of chemical additives,\" Obanya added. \"This means the consequences of tire pollution can be unexpected and far reaching.\"\n\nHow concerned are you about microplastics in your body?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "TREMONTON, Utah (ABC4) — A sacred rock with petroglyphs important to the Northwestern Band (NWB) of the Shoshone Nation has been restored and returned to its original location after it spent decades at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints meetinghouse.\n\nThe petroglyphs are around 1,200 years old, and they were created by the Fremont people, who were ancestors of the NWB of the Shoshone Nation. The effort to restore the petroglyphs and return them took over a decade, and it involved the NWB of the Shoshone Nation, the state of Utah, and conservators working with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nGrand Canyon trail closures announced for 2026 construction\n\nAccording to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the rock was removed from its original location in the northern Utah mountains about 80 years ago, and it spent the majority of that time outside of the Tremonton meetinghouse.\n\nRyan Saltzgiver, history sites curator for the Church History Department, said that it’s unknown exactly why the 2,500-pound rock was brought to the church, but in 2011, it was discovered by amateur archeologists.\n\nSaltzgiver said that they’ve spent the time since that discovery working with the NWB of the Shoshone Nation and the Utah State Historic Preservation Office to bring everyone together and create a plan for preservation and repatriation.\n\nBYU students’ book supporting mental health nonprofits\n\nBrad Parry, vice chair of the NWB of the Shoshone Nation, said, “Putting it back for us is putting a puzzle piece back into place. Our history is so fractured with a lot of things that happened to us. To have these positive things now that are coming out — it’s rebuilding our history. And I can’t overstate that.”\n\n“We do have a moral and ethical obligation to care for things like this that are in our possession — and in particular to return those things that are, in this case, very sacred objects to those rightful owners,” Saltzgiver said.\n\nThe restoration process was very involved, as conservators chosen by Church historians cleaned years of lichen growth from the rock. They had to clean it without damaging the surface or the petroglyphs, and conservators wound up using soap and water, nontoxic biocide, and steam.\n\nHow to make ABC4 your preferred news source on Google\n\nMegan Randall, an objects conservator with the Midwest Art Conservation Center, said, “Even if it’s not the cleanest, in a couple months or a year, it will continue to sort of clean itself with the application of the biocide. There’s not that many people out there who do this, which makes our work very interesting and varied.”\n\nRandall also highlighted the spiritual importance of the petroglyphs to the tribe. “We want to make those visible and appreciable by the people who find value in this, which is also us,” she said.\n\nThe rock was returned to its original location near the Utah-Idaho border, joining its companion petroglyphs. A ceremony was held, including a blessing from a Shoshone tribal spiritual leader.\n\n“This rock was meant to be here. It’s like this rock knows it’s home,” Parry said.\n\nTimeline: Court proceedings for Tyler Robinson, man accused of killing Charlie Kirk\n\nUTA to upgrade bus fleet using $41 million in federal funding\n\nCapitol Conversations: Rep.

    "description": "You can't even play full songs in ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "When ChatGPT first launched, it was strictly about dealing with text. You could ask it to write you a poem, to check your code for errors, or to build you a grocery list from a recipe. Fast forward three years, and the app has changed completely—for better or for worse. Not only has ChatGPT's large language model (LLM) improved dramatically from GPT-3.5 to GPT-5.2, but the bot has gone multimodal. It can understand text, but also images, video, and the internet at large. 2025's ChatGPT is hardly the same product as 2022's.\n\nOne of the many upgrades to ChatGPT over the past three years has been app integrations: You've been able to connect OpenAI's chatbot to ask it to do things on your behalf. You could connect to Expedia to ask ChatGPT for help booking a hotel, Zillow to ask the bot to help you find an apartment, or Canva for help with creating a slide. Whether these integrations are any more useful than simply using the respective app itself is perhaps up to each user, but these integrations exist all the same.\n\nFidji Simo, OpenAI's CEO of applications, announced the integration in a Substack post on Tuesday. Among other updates, like a new image gen model and new writing tools, Simo revealed new app integrations for the chatbot, including OpenTable, Salesforce, Clay, Lovable, and, of course, Apple Music. At the time, details were limited, but now, the integration is officially live.\n\nFirst of all, you don't actually need to It's an interesting note, since Apple Music itself requires a paid subscription to access. But with ChatGPT, you can access elements of the services without paying—keyword \"elements.\"\n\nOnce you connect the services together, you'll be able to search Apple Music for songs, artists, albums, and playlists within ChatGPT. In addition to music discoverability, you can also generate playlists, and listen to clips of songs you find. ChatGPT doesn't specify how long those clips are, but if they base it off of iTunes, it could be anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. If you thought this integration was all about listening to Apple Music tunes while using ChatGPT, think again: You'll still need Apple Music itself for the listening side of things.\n\nOf course, if you have an Apple Music account, the integration is a bit more useful. If so, you'll be able to add songs, albums, and playlists to your Apple Music library that you found or generated from ChatGPT.\n\nLove it or hate it, ChatGPT isn't necessarily designed with user privacy in mind. After all, part of the company's business model is training its LLMs on your ChatGPT interactions—unless you specifically opt out. As such, the idea of connecting your Apple Music subscription to ChatGPT raises some privacy alarm bells in my mind. Apple Music doesn't have the most sensitive user information in your digital portfolio, but it does contain quite a bit of extra data ChatGPT can collect from you.\n\nAt the top of the Apple music connection tool, OpenAI says, \"You're in control.\" The company is adamant that ChatGPT \"always respects\" your preferences on training data, and is held to the permissions you've already set. That said, the company also warns that by using apps, you run the risk of falling victim to attack: If hackers decide to attack ChatGPT, your data could get swooped up. You'll also end up sharing data points like your IP address and approximate location, as well as ChatGPT data with Apple Music. (The data sharing goes both ways here.)\n\nOne benefit here is that ChatGPT doesn't appear to have access to your listening history. While the app can create playlists for you, it can't actually see what you're choosing to listen to in Apple Music itself.\n\nI personally don't use ChatGPT, and even if I did, I don't think I'd connect my Apple Music account here. I find the discoverability within the app itself fine for my needs, and when it isn't, the greater internet already helps me find new music. I'm not sure I'd feel the benefits of ChatGPT's intelligence here, especially when it comes with the risk of keeping all my Apple Music data in yet another location.\n\nIf you're not like me, and you're interested in trying out this integration, you can connect Apple Music to ChatGPT from the latter's app or web app. Head to the sidebar, choose Apps, then find and select \"Apple Music.\"",

    "description": "You can connect apps like Photoshop, Apple Music, and Slack to ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "Earlier this year, OpenAI announced ChatGPT apps. Not the ChatGPT app, mind you: That's been out for more than a couple years now. ChatGPT apps, on the other hand, are programs that work within ChatGPT. You can access them in any given conversation with ChatGPT—in fact, they may appear based on the context of the conversation.\n\nThese aren't necessarily apps that OpenAI builds itself, either; rather, you'll find options here based on apps you may use yourself. The initial batch of apps included with the feature's rollout included Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Figma, Expedia, Spotify, and Zillow—big apps you've likely used before.\n\nWhile in a conversation with ChatGPT, you could ask the bot to help you book a flight to Paris via Expedia, find a particular listing through Zillow, or create a slide for a presentation with Canva. From OpenAI's perspective, this adds a host of additional functionality to ChatGPT the company couldn't offer itself. OpenAI doesn't need to build an apartment-hunting tool into ChatGPT; it can just pull in Zillow. It also doesn't escape me that the more apps that OpenAI folds into ChatGPT, the less likely it is you'll need to leave ChatGPT to do something in another app—but that's none of my business.\n\nSpeaking of more apps, the company plans to expand these apps overtime, as developers create ChatGPT-compatible extensions for their programs. That was part of yesterday's news: OpenAI is now letting developers submit apps to ChatGPT en masse. What's more, these apps will be hosted in an \"app directory,\" though many online are taking to calling it an app store. (There's no payment necessary, however, so app directory might really be a more apt description.) You'll find this new app directory in the sidebar of ChatGPT, appropriately called \"Apps.\"\n\nApps is apparently in beta, according to a label affixed to its title in ChatGPT. Here, you'll find a rotating slide featuring an ad for some of the service's biggest apps, like Canva and Zillow, and, below it, rows of apps to choose from. Right now, the apps are sorted into \"Featured,\" \"Lifestyle,\" and \"Productivity,\" with no option that includes all the apps. (But they seem to be entirely split across Lifestyle and Productivity.) There are a lot of options here already. Some made headlines this week, like Photoshop and Apple Music, while others arrived more quietly, like Asana, Uber, and Target. It's not just traditional apps like Zillow or Spotify that are getting the app treatment here, either. OpenAI is also considering \"connector\" services, like Google Drive, as \"apps.\"\n\nYou can click on any app in the directory to see what you can do with it. Slack, for example, says you can look up your chats and messages to summarize threads, generate recaps, and come up with responses. You can check on your Asana tasks to generate progress reports and status updates. Outlook says you can create \"talking points\" and generate follow-ups from your emails and calendar events. While there's a brief summary underneath each title, you'll need to click through to each service to see the full picture of what it actually offers.\n\nHere are the apps I'm seeing at this time. Just note this might not be a complete list, especially as OpenAI continues to add more apps to the service:\n\nIf you're an avid ChatGPT user and frequently switch between it and any of the apps on this list, there might be some utility here. Maybe coders will find the integration with Hugging Face and Lovable to be beneficial, while Photoshop users might take advantage of the AI image editing tools this integration provides. But I'm still left feeling like this is more gimmick than anything else: I don't need to connect my Slack to ChatGPT to generate follow-ups for me: I'm perfectly capable of responding to emails myself, and managing my own calendar, so no need to connect Outlook or another email client to the bot. Maybe a future update will sell me on connecting generative AI to all aspects of my work and personal life, but so far, I'm still not convinced.",

Thank you so much. I am so grateful. To all my team-mates, coaches, I am so grateful,\" Agyemang said after receiving the award on Thursday.\n\n\"To my family, who have supported me all this year and throughout my career - even if it hasn't been that long - I love you.\n\n\"A big thank you to God for this opportunity. I am so thankful.\"\n\nAgyemang was also nominated for the Kopa Trophy for the world's best under-21 female player.\n\nShe has been on loan at Brighton from Arsenal since September 2024, with the Seagulls re-signing her on loan in August after her success with England.\n\nLast season, she scored five goals in 22 appearances as Brighton came fifth in the Women's Super League - their highest finish in the competition.\n\nHowever, Agyemang is set to miss the rest of the 2025-26 season after rupturing her anterior cruciate ligament while playing for the Lionesses in October.",

    "fullText": "After an intense debate on player availability and the timing of the tournament, the focus has begun to shift to the pitch as another mid-season edition of the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) kicks off in Morocco on Sunday.\n\nOn the face of it, the two main talking points ahead of the 2025 finals are whether the host nation can extend their world record run of 18 consecutive wins and claim just a second title, and if Mohamed Salah will finally lift the trophy with Egypt.\n\nThe 33-year-old's future at Liverpool has dominated headlines since his explosive assertion on 6 December that he has been \"thrown under the bus\" by the club.\n\nAfter making his return from the bench at Anfield last Saturday, Salah will now be focused on his fifth attempt to clinch the continent's biggest prize - especially after two previous defeats in finals.\n\nBut concentrating on just two topics would not do justice to a unique tournament characterised by unpredictability.\n\nIvory Coast delivered a remarkable home success in February last year, having sacked their coach during the group stage, while Senegal's fine form was underlined by their win over England in June.\n\nElsewhere, Nigeria aim to go one better than at the 2023 finals but fellow heavyweights Cameroon appear, from the outside, to be in chaos - with both countries looking to make amends after missing out on the 2026 Fifa World Cup.\n\nWith seven different winners from the past eight editions, Morocco 2025 is certain to be a compelling watch as sides battle for a trophy hailed as the \"holy grail of African football\" by Benin assistant coach Tunde Adelakun.\n\n\"It's so hard to win the Africa Cup of Nations. People love us a lot, but if [you] win they will never forget you,\" Morocco midfielder Sofyan Amrabat told the BBC World Service.",

    "fullText": "Team Europe have been named the BBC Sports Personality Team of the Year 2025 after their thrilling victory at the Ryder Cup.\n\nCaptain Luke Donald led the Europeans to a first win on American soil since 2012 with a 15-13 triumph in New York.\n\nAgainst a volatile home crowd at Bethpage Black, Europe claimed just their fifth victory in the USA since the tournament's inception in 1927.\n\nThe Europeans set the stage for one of the most dramatic days in Ryder Cup history by taking an 11½-4½ lead into Sunday's final day.\n\nIt was the first time either side had held a seven-point lead before the final day, and Europe only needed three points to clinch victory.\n\nNo side had ever come back from more than a four-point deficit to triumph, but the USA staged a superb fightback to claw themselves back into contention.\n\nHowever, Europe just managed to hold on to secure their first away win since the 'Miracle at Medinah' in 2012.\n\n\"As a lot of other sports people in this room know, it's an honour to be a part of these teams,\" said Rory McIlroy as he collected the award for Team Europe alongside Tommy Fleetwood.\n\nMcIlroy, who won BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2025, added: \"We're up here as two of the 12 players. We also had the captain, vice captain and all of the backroom team - we could not have done what we did without all of them.\"",

    "fullText": "As if two games in 48 hours were not enough, Crystal Palace now face an additional two-legged play-off to keep their European dream alive.\n\nThursday's frustrating 2-2 draw with Finnish champions KuPS left Palace outside the automatic last-16 places in the Conference League, Europe's third-tier competition.\n\nThe Eagles, who are making their debut in major European competition, will have to play additional matches on 19 February and 26 February for the right to play in the knockout stage after finishing 10th in the table.\n\nBoss Oliver Glasner named an under-strength team packed with fringe and academy players because of the tight turnaround.\n\nNo sooner had the referee blown the final whistle at Selhurst Park, Glasner's attention immediately switched to Saturday's Premier League match at Leeds United.\n\nTwo first-team matches in 48 hours will be followed by a Carabao Cup quarter-final at Arsenal next Tuesday - and now Palace, who were demoted from the Europa League to the Conference League over ownership rules, face two additional European games in the new year.\n\nHaving appeared in the Conference League play-off round in August before the league phase, Palace could end the season having played 68 matches in all competitions, including the Community Shield.\n\n\"With the demotion, we got the play-offs in August and with this result we get the play-offs in February,\" said Glasner after Thursday's match.\n\n\"The result is not what we wanted. It's a game we could easily have won.\n\n\"The only thing I don't like is that Leeds now know our starting line-up because there are only 11 players who didn't start - and nobody will start both games.\"",

    "fullText": "Golfer Rory McIlroy has been voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2025 after clinching the career Grand Slam and playing a key role in Europe's Ryder Cup win.\n\nThe 36-year-old from Northern Ireland achieved golfing immortality in April when he won the Masters at Augusta National to complete the set of all four majors.\n\nHe became just the sixth man - and first European - to achieve the Slam, joining Americans Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods, and South Africa's Gary Player, in accomplishing the feat.\n\nHaving won the US Open, The Open and US PGA Championship by 2014, McIlroy had to wait another 11 years to make his \"dreams come true\".\n\nHe then played a key role in Europe's first Ryder Cup win in the United States since 2012, contributing three and a half points to his team's triumph.\n\nMcIlroy also delighted his home crowd by winning the Irish Open for a second time, with further successes at the Players Championship and the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, before topping off a stellar year with his seventh Race to Dubai title.\n\n\"Wow,\" McIlroy said after receiving the award. \"First of all, I would like to congratulate all of the other finalists. I know how much hard work and dedication it takes, so it is a pleasure to just be in this room. I feel truly honoured to just be a part of it.\n\n\"2025 has been the year I made my dreams come true. From Augusta to the Ryder Cup and everything in between. It's the year dreams are made of.\"\n\nEngland rugby union player Ellie Kildunne came second, with Formula 1 driver Lando Norris in third.\n\nJust minutes before collecting his individual award, McIlroy - along with Tommy Fleetwood - collected the Team of the Year award after Team Europe were honoured for their Ryder Cup success.",
