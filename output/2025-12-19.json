    "description": "Love it or loathe it, there’s no escaping it — Jake Paul vs. Anthony Joshua is Friday night in Miami.",
    "fullText": "This weekend of action needs no introduction.\n\nLove it or loathe it, there’s no escaping it — Jake Paul vs. Anthony Joshua is Friday night in Miami, and the noise around it has been impossible to ignore.\n\nAfter five years of boxing in relatively controlled environments, Paul finally steps into a bout that offers no safety net, no asterisks and no soft landing. This is his chance to silence the skeptics and show that he belongs in the sport as more than just a novelty act chasing headlines.\n\nFor Joshua, the responsibility — and the opportunity — sits squarely in his fists. One emphatic statement against the YouTuber-turned-boxer would not only bring the Paul experiment to a crashing halt, but also send “AJ” into 2026 with momentum, relevance and the attention of a U.S. audience suddenly invested in the next chapter of his career.\n\nBut that’s not all that’s happening …\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the five biggest things to look out for this weekend in the world of boxing:\n\nIt feels less like a question of \"if\" and more of a matter of when Paul will get flattened Friday night — and that view isn’t rooted in any lack of respect.\n\nI’ve long since run out of ways to dress up how brave Paul is for taking this fight, but bravery has a habit of bleeding into recklessness when the gap is this vast. There’s a thin line between the two, and Paul is straddling it.\n\nJoshua is levels above him in every conceivable department, several rungs higher on every ladder you care to climb. I don’t doubt for a second that AJ stops Paul on Friday, but there’s just enough curiosity in the chaos to make it unmissable as a spectacle.\n\nStrip it back and it’s boxing in its rawest form. “Step right up, place your bets, and see how long the smaller novice can survive with a seasoned professional before getting knocked out.”\n\nAfter a brief spell of sizing his man up, it will last precisely as long as Joshua decides it should — and you can take that to the bank.\n\nThere’s every chance this is just another colossal marketing exercise from Jake Paul — albeit one that could come with a very real physical cost.\n\nEven if Paul ends the night face down and unconscious, he still gets to walk away claiming he had the nerve to share a ring with an athlete as big, powerful and proven as Anthony Joshua.\n\nThe sheer number of eyes that will land on this Netflix card only drags Most Valuable Promotions further into the mainstream, and the inevitable memes that follow will do nothing but extend Paul’s reach globally in a sport he appears genuinely invested in.\n\nAnd it’s worth remembering: He’s rebuilt before. After losing to Tommy Fury in 2023, he somehow found himself back in the spotlight mixing it up with — checks notes — Mike Tyson.\n\nWins don’t always end with your hand raised, and Paul might just be playing the long game.\n\nJust over a week ago, WBC lightweight champion Caroline Dubois was still in kind of a career limbo.\n\nThe 24-year-old had turned down two offers from Most Valuable Promotions in an attempt to lure her away from Boxxer and had nothing lineup up in terms of action.\n\nBut a week in boxing can change a lot. Finally agreeing to terms on the third offer — joining a host of female talent, including world champions Ellie Scotney and Alycia Baumgardner — and Dubois is now an MVP fighter, and even better, has been thrown onto the undercard in Miami on Friday night.\n\nDubois defends her WBC title at 135 pounds against Italy’s Camilla Panatta in what is expected to be a routine victory, before moving into a busy 2026 where the hit list is plentiful for “Sweet” Caroline.\n\nDubois has grown rapidly in ability and confidence over the past 18 months, and she’s targeting Baumgardner and fellow Brit Terri Harper next year in an attempt to follow in her big brother’s successful footsteps of headlining major cards.\n\nAfter making his return to the ring in August following a 26-year absence, Ike “The President” Ibeabuchi is back (again) on Christmas Eve (obviously) fighting 45-year-old Kabiru Towolawi.\n\nHeadlining a fight card called “Redemption” in Lagos, Nigeria, Ibeabuchi continues his quest to become world heavyweight champion at 52.\n\nThe card will be streamed on prizefighting.tv, and there is a heavy lean on the narrative that Ibeabuchi is en route to bigger and better things in the sport, specifically breaking then-45-year-old George Foreman's record as the oldest heavyweight champion.\n\nIf delusion is your cup of tea, then check out the press release championing Ibeabuchi’s second coming:\n\n“If Ike can dismantle a tough, active opponent like Kabiru, the comeback is no longer a 'story' — it is a reality. The fact that he has maintained his physique and his focus for nearly three decades should strike fear into the hearts of current champions. He isn't just fighting for a paycheck; he is fighting for a miracle.”\n\nSpeaking of Africa, Matchroom is in Ghana on Saturday night to promote itrs first show on the African continent.\n\nBritish light heavyweights Craig Richards and Dan Azeez headline a bill inside Accra's Legon Sports Stadium in a real crossroads fight between two extremely likable fighters.\n\nA loss for either Richards (35) or Azeez (36) would surely push him close to the exit door of a sport that has provided them both with the esteemed British title and numerous nights of domestic barnburners.\n\nBut for the winner? A big night in the opposite corner to rising Ben Whittaker could be the prize on offer.",

    "description": "WWE star GUNTHER explains the differences between his retirement matches with John Cena and Goldberg.",
    "fullText": "After two major wins this year, GUNTHER now has the unique distinction of retiring John Cena and Goldberg, both of whom are considered legends within WWE. Outside of their high-profile status in WWE, though, \"The Ring General\" indicates that Cena and Goldberg vastly differ. During a new interview with TMZ's \"Inside The Ring,\" he explained how.\n\n\"Very different situation I think because Goldberg was also way more limited than John was. John was just a better wrestler over all his whole career. It's not like it dig to Goldberg. He didn't get famous by putting on in-ring master classes. That was never his thing, so it was a very different situation,\" GUNTHER said when asked to contrast his encounters with Cena and Goldberg.\n\n\"Also the magnitude of it. Obviously, Goldberg is a big name, but it's not comparable to what John Cena represents or the following he has, what he carries with him, and the connection that people have to him. It was hard to compare.\"\n\nGUNTHER's faceoff with Goldberg came at WWE Saturday Night's Main Event on July 12, which ended with the latter passing out to the former's sleeper hold. At SNME on December 13, GUNTHER again emerged victorious with his sleeper hold, this time by making Cena, a conduit of perseverance, tap out.\n\nFollowing their retirement matches, Goldberg and Cena have officially hung up their wrestling boots, or sneakers in Cena's case, at the ages of 58 and 48, respectively. Cena remains a part of the WWE family through his role as an ambassador.\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"Inside The Ring\" with a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "No matter what happens this weekend, Mainz will spend the winter break at the bottom of the Bundesliga table. Despite that hard fact, the Rheinhessen will at least have European football to offer their fans in the coming 2026 calendar year. Heading into the Bundesliga’s 15th matchday, Mainz have still only won one solitary league fixture. In Europe, they’ve been a different beast.\n\nThursday night’s 2-0 home win over Samsunspor gave Mainz four wins in the Conference League this autumn. With the 2025/26 UEFA Europa Conference League group phase now complete, Mainz have finished 7th place in the table and will not have to contest the February playoff round. Come March, the Palatinate club will compete in the Round-of-16 phase of the competition.\n\nOnce again, the team was able to deliver its  fans a magical European evening.\n\nAfter the full time whistle, newly appointed FSV head coach Urs Fischer spoke of a “trying match that featured lots of suffering” when speaking to German broadcaster RTL. Mainz’s de-facto leader on the pitch – tapped by Fischer to serve up higher than usual in the No. 10 slot – didn’t exactly feel the same way. Nadiem Amiri led the FSV cheers in his usual trademark fashion.\n\n“It was very important for me to come out and perform like this again today,” Amiri told RTL. “To finally feel fit and free. It’s a huge step for the club and for us [as a team] a small set in the right direction.“\n\nAmiri’s sunk the crucial 2-0 from the penalty spot shortly after the restart. The latest conversion makes it seven straight penalties for the club’s designated taker. The 29-year-old’s interviewer naturally wished to know if he modeled himself after Bundesliga record breaker Harry Kane.\n\n“Harry Kane is on a totally different level than me,” Amiri answered. “But he’s definitely a role model from whom I learn. I think I’m good at taking penalties, but I have to keep it up.“\n\n“I think today was by far our best performance of the season,” Amiri assured his interviewer. “We were organized on the ball and against the ball. sensational. We can build on this performance.“",

    "title": "Kyle Whittingham on why now was the right time to step down and his post-Utah future",
    "description": "In first interview with the media since stepping down as Utah’s head coach, Whittingham spoke about his decision and what the future holds",
    "fullText": "In his first interview with the media since stepping down as Utah’s head coach last Friday, Kyle Whittingham addressed why now was the right time for him to walk away from the program he’s been in charge of for the past 21 seasons.\n\n“Well, the program’s in a good place right now,” he said after practice Thursday. “As I’ve said many times after last season, it just didn’t sit right with anybody, particularly me, and so came back and fortunately we were able to get the ship righted and everything’s on track.\n\n“Program, like I said, is in a good spot. Got good coaches, coach (Morgan) Scalley will come in and do a great job, got good players, so now is the time.”\n\nWhittingham will coach his final game for Utah in the Dec. 31 Las Vegas Bowl vs. Nebraska.\n\n“This team has been one of my favorite years. The team attitude, the leadership, the work ethic, just the personality and the feel, the vibe of the team is outstanding and having the chance to be around these guys one more month and go to battle one more time with them is something I wanted to do,” Whittingham said.\n\nThe future for Whittingham after he finishes his 266th game as head coach of the Utes is still up in the air. The language used in last Friday’s announcement was “stepping down,” not “retiring,” and moments after the decision was announced, multiple national reporters, including The Athletic’s Stewart Mandel, reported that Whittingham could pursue other coaching opportunities.\n\n“Whittingham, 66, is not retiring, according to a source close to the coach, and may pursue other coaching opportunities,” Mandel wrote on X.\n\nPer’s Whittingham’s latest contract with Utah, he would serve as a “Special Assistant to the Athletics Director” for two years following retirement. That position would pay him $3.45 million per year and Whittingham would not be required to provide more than 10 hours of consulting in a week.\n\nBut is Whittingham’s desire to coach “out of his system” and is he ready to step away from the sidelines completely?\n\n“I don’t know if it’s ever out of your system. I mean it’s in your blood and so I don’t know about that,” he said. “That being said, I’m not sure what I’m going to do, but when you got the coaching in your blood, it just doesn’t go away.”\n\nAsked if this was not a retirement, Whittingham responded, “Who knows? We’ll see. I’m just stepping down and step away and reevaluate things.”\n\nAs for what the process of deciding whether to pursue other opportunities or move into his special assistant role at Utah looks like, it’s pretty simple for Whittingham.\n\n“If my phone rings, I answer it, I like who’s calling? Then we’ll see. Yeah, that’s pretty much the process,” Whittingham said.\n\nUltimately, Whittingham’s decision to step down seemed to come down to his feeling that now was the right time to transition the program over to Scalley.\n\nAdditionally, Whittingham said multiple times on Thursday that he didn’t want to “overstay his welcome” after 21 years in charge of the program.\n\n“I’m a free agent. I’m in the transfer portal,” Whittingham said to laughs. “So yeah, it’s a different feel, but like I said, I’m at peace and I did not want to be that guy that overstayed his welcome and people just saying, ‘Hey, when’s this guy going to leave?’\n\n“That was not my intention ever and I hope I didn’t do that. I’m sure with some people I did do that, but to me the timing is right.”\n\nIt’s still Whittingham’s team until after the Las Vegas Bowl. Aside from the players who have entered the transfer portal, Whittingham said Thursday that Utah has just three opt-outs so far for the New Year’s Eve bowl game — offensive tackle Spencer Fano, offensive tackle Caleb Lomu and defensive end Logan Fano, all of whom have declared for the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nOther than that, Whittingham is expecting everyone, including quarterback Devon Dampier, to play in the Las Vegas Bowl.\n\n“As far as not playing in the game, I think that what we have right now is what we’re going to the game with. I hope so,” Whittingham said.\n\nUtah, favored by 16.5 points against a Nebraska team that will be missing its starting quarterback and running back, has plenty of motivation to send Whittingham out with his 178th win at Utah.\n\n“It means a lot to me. … That’s a coach that believed in me to come in here after being at New Mexico and just had full trust in me and the offense to do what we do and that’s just huge respect from him and just what he’s done for this program,” Dampier said.\n\n“I got to finish well for him.”\n\nWhile Whittingham’s post-Utah future is still unclear as of this week, the program’s future is Scalley, who was announced as Utah’s next head coach last Saturday.\n\nWhittingham gave his full endorsement to Scalley, who played at Utah and coached for nearly two decades under Whittingham and now will lead the Utes starting in the 2026 season.\n\n“He’s organized. He’s really good with Xs and Os. He’s really good at connecting with players. His culture ideas, my culture ideas align perfectly. We both have a lot of the same recruiting strategies and thoughts, evaluation-wise, how you navigate the portal, all that stuff,” Whittingham said.\n\n“It’s very consistent and I think that there’s going to be far more similarities than change. Now he’ll put his own stamp on the program and make no mistake, but way back when I took over for Urban (Meyer) if it’s not broke, don’t fix it. We hung on to a lot of the stuff that Urban did here, but (Scalley) has been here a lot of years. He’s a Utah Man through and through, and so I think it’s going to be a good situation.”\n\nScalley is in the process of building his staff right now and he will be introduced as Utah’s head coach in a press conference on Jan. 6.",

    "title": "NFL Predictions: 3 Plus Money Bets to Target for Week 16",
    "description": "Targeting value in Week 16 NFL betting? We break down three plus-money predictions worth backing, with matchup analysis, betting angles, and odds insight.",
    "fullText": "Plus-money props are where opportunity meets context, and this week offers plenty of both.\n\nA rookie quarterback heading on the road is being undervalued by the market, while two proven veterans are playing with real money on the line as contract incentives come into focus.\n\nMotivation, matchup, and usage all align to create outsized NFL picks at longer odds.\n\nSince returning to the lineup, J.J. McCarthy looks rejuvenated, throwing five touchdown passes against vulnerable Washington and Dallas defenses. The Giants profile similarly when it comes to stopping offenses near the goal line, making this another spot where efficiency should show up on the scoreboard.\n\nNew York ranks bottom five in red-zone defense and is riding an eight-game losing skid, allowing 31.5 points per game. This is a defense that struggles to stop drives, and the Minnesota Vikings are well-positioned to take advantage. McCarthy has also shown he’s not afraid to push the ball downfield, ranking second in air yards per attempt while benefiting from the second-best protection rate in the league at 88 percent.\n\nMinnesota’s red-zone tendencies further support the Over. The Vikings have been ineffective running the ball near the goal line to the point that C.J. Ham handled the short-yardage touchdown last week. As a result, Minnesota ranks among the most pass-heavy teams in the red zone. All signs point toward McCarthy clearing 1.5 passing touchdowns.\n\nStefon Diggs has incentive money firmly in play with three games remaining. He’s three receptions shy of a $500K bonus, and 13 catches away from another $500K, putting a total of $1 million on the line. Diggs has recorded at least three receptions in all but one game this season, but has been quieter recently in a pair of run-heavy matchups against the Bills and Giants.\n\nThat could change this week against Baltimore, a defense allowing the sixth-most receptions to wide receivers. If Diggs wants to make a real push toward that second incentive at 80 catches, the volume needs to start building now. With the Jets up next and a Week 18 matchup against Miami that could turn run-heavy if playoff positioning is settled, this sets up as a spot where Diggs is motivated, and the matchup finally cooperates.\n\nFollow me here, because this angle makes sense. Nick Folk has been one of the most reliable kickers in the league, converting 96.2 percent of his attempts, the best mark in the NFL. This also happens to be his final indoor game of the season before trips to the Meadowlands and Orchard Park in Weeks 17 and 18, where kicking conditions become far less predictable.\n\nFolk sits at 25 made field goals and has significant incentives in play, earning $375K at 27 makes and another $500K if he reaches 30. He kicks for an offense that struggles to finish drives and draws another favorable matchup against the Saints this week. Indoors, the leash is longer, and there’s a real chance the coaching staff is more aggressive with long attempts than they’d consider outdoors. Folk has missed just one kick all season and is 7-for-8 from 50-plus, which could turn a few borderline decisions into field goal tries with real incentive-driven upside.\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "fullText": "Three games concluded* the third phase of the Copa del Rey 2025/26, this Thursday (18).\n\n*Granada vs. Rayo Vallecano still needs to be played and is scheduled for January 6.\n\nAnd, with Burgos' 3-1 victory over Getafe, the teams from Spain's second division broke a 30-year record in the tournament.\n\nThis is because the 2025/26 edition has become the one with the highest number of second division teams in the round of 16 in the last three decades.\n\nThere are five teams fighting to be among the top eight in the competition this season.\n\nBesides Burgos, the clubs Albacete, Cultural Leonesa, Deportivo La Coruña, and Racing Santander are the representatives of Spain's \"second division\" in the round of 16.\n\nGranada is also in the \"Serie B\" and, therefore, if they eliminate Rayo Vallecano, they will match the number of participants from 30 years ago in the round of 16.\n\nThere were six teams: Badajoz, Mallorca, Palamós, Rayo, Toledo, and UE Lleida.\n\nThis Thursday (18), Athletic Bilbao and Real Betis (La Liga teams) eliminated Ourense CF and Real Murcia (third division teams) with victories of 1-0 and 2-0, respectively.\n\nBarcelona (2-0 over Guadalajara), Real Madrid (3-2 over Talavera), Elche (1-0 over Eibar), Real Sociedad (2-1 over Eldense), Valencia (2-0 over Sporting Gijón), Osasuna (4-2 over Huesca), Atlético de Madrid (3-2 over Atlético Baleares), and Alavés (1-0 over Sevilla) are the other teams (all from La Liga) qualified for the round of 16 of the Copa del Rey 2025/26.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": "Joe Buck will be part of ESPN’s first game lineup to call the Los Angeles Dodgers vs. New York Mets game.",
    "fullText": "Joe Buck will be part of ESPN’s first game lineup to call the Los Angeles Dodgers vs. New York Mets game on April 15, as he announced on SI Media with Jimmy Traina. This marks Buck’s second consecutive year being part of ESPN’s first broadcast.\n\nDespite ESPN and Major League Baseball reaching a deal to air 30 regular-season games, Buck is only scheduled to call the Dodgers-Mets game. Last season marked the first time Buck called a nationally broadcasted baseball game since 2021, after leaving Fox for ESPN.\n\nIn 2022, Buck and Troy Aikman signed a multiyear deal with ESPN to become the voices of Monday Night Football. Despite shifting his focus mostly to the NFL, Buck returned for an MLB game alongside Chip Caray in the St. Louis Cardinals' booth in 2024.\n\nBuck and Caray also have fathers who were sports broadcasters. Joe Buck worked alongside his father, Jack, as a Cardinals radio and television broadcaster from 1991 to 2007.\n\nHe also called the PGA Tournament and hosted an alternate broadcast in 2022. The 56-year-old broadcaster prefers calling baseball games earlier in the season because he feels more prepared.\n\n“For someone who hasn’t been involved in the game for four years, and I did Opening Day last year, I think it’s easier to launch off the beginning of the season because it’s not looking back,” Buck told Traina.\n\nBuck also believes calling a game featuring the back-to-back World Series champions will make his job easier.\n\n“It’s a Dodger game, I think it’s Dodger-Mets so, there’s a lot to talk about. I mean, I could probably do it right now. The Dodgers, half their lineup’s going to end up in the Hall of Fame. They’re easy names.”\n\nWhile Buck didn’t officially rule out calling a game later in the season or during the playoffs, he acknowledged it would be much more challenging.\n\n“I’m not prepared to do that without putting myself in solitary confinement for a month and trying to catch up with everything that’s gone on,” Buck said.\n\nBefore Buck’s four-year absence from baseball, he was one of the most recognizable voices in the sport. He served as Fox’s lead play-by-play announcer from 1996 to 2021. During that time, Buck called 23 World Series and 21 All-Star Games, the most by any play-by-play announcer on network television.\n\nBuck will receive the 2026 Ford C. Frick Award, which is presented annually to a broadcaster for major contributions to baseball. Buck and his father will become the first father-son duo to receive the award.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams will need to be at their best Thursday night to pick up a huge NFC West Division win against the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nBut they'll have to do that without Davante Adams.\n\nThe superstar wide receiver is on the sideline, not on the field, leaving Matthew Stafford to rely on Puka Nacua and a bunch of down-the-depth-chart WRs beyond him.\n\nThe Rams are slight underdogs, likely in part due to Adams' absence. But with Stafford, they still have a great chance.\n\nMORE: ACL recovery timeline impacts when Patrick Mahomes, Micah Parsons will return\n\nDavante Adams is out Thursday night against the Seahawks due to injury.\n\nAdams was listed as doubtful for the game originally, both with knee and hamstring issues, and didn't practice all week.\n\nHe has been fantastic for the Rams this season, catching 60 passes for 789 yards and 14 touchdowns.\n\nMORE: Bills may not win the AFC East — but they sent a clear warning to the rest of the NFL\n\nWithout Adams, the depth chart is a bit unclear. Konata Mumpfield saw the third-most snaps a week ago. The Rams also have Tutu Atwell, Jordan Whittington and Xavier Smith, in addition to a full tight end assortment to choose from.\n\nThe Rams will get the helpful \"mini-bye\" after this that should allow Adams to recover and make it back out on the field sooner rather than later.\n\nJaxson Dart has a 50% head injury problem\n\nTrevor Lawrence had a game never before done by an NFL quarterback\n\nThe Packers had a chance to sign an all-time great for $5 million and passed\n\nTua Tagovailoa's contract looks like a nightmare\n\nPatrick Mahomes' injury has fans asking Tom Brady ACL question\n\nThis Mike Tomlin horrible streak is hard to believe",

    "fullText": "The Detroit Tigers continued to add pitching depth to the organization, signing right-hander Inohan Paniagua and left-hander Enmanuel De Jesus to minor league contracts, re-signing left-handers Sean Guenther and Carlos Peña, and extending a non-roster invitation to De Jesus for spring training.\n\nPaniagua, 23, is a power right-hander who bolsters Detroit’s lower-level pitching depth. Signed out of the Dominican Republic, he has spent much of his professional career developing as a starter. His fastball reaches the mid-90s, and the Tigers will continue to evaluate his secondary offerings as they determine whether his future is best suited for the rotation or a relief role as he advances through the system.\n\nDe Jesus, 27, adds experienced left-handed depth and versatility. The Venezuelan native has pitched at the Triple-A level and has worked both as a starter and reliever, giving Detroit a flexible option capable of covering multiple innings. While he has yet to establish himself at the major league level, De Jesus has shown an ability to generate swings and misses and will get an extended look in big league camp as a non-roster invitee.\n\nGuenther, 28, returns on a minor league deal after spending last season in the Tigers’ system. A former Rule 5 pick by Miami, Guenther has big league experience and has primarily worked out of the bullpen. He relies on a fastball-slider combination and provides additional left-handed relief depth at the upper levels of the organization.\n\nPeña also returns to the Tigers after previously pitching in the system. The left-hander adds further organizational depth and familiarity with Detroit’s player development staff. While he is expected to open the season in the minors, Peña gives the Tigers another experienced arm as they build out their pitching inventory.\n\nThe moves underscore Detroit’s emphasis on pitching depth across all levels of the organization. None of the signings are expected to immediately impact the major league roster, but they provide the Tigers with added flexibility entering spring training and the 2026 season.\n\nFollow me on \"X\" @rogcastbaseball",

    "fullText": "The Baltimore Ravens got star quarterback Lamar Jackson back at practice on Thursday, but three players were listed with new injuries.\n\nJackson has been getting consistent rest on Wednesdays, and a minor illness was even more reason to keep him at home. He returned to practice as a full participant and will likely be off the injury report altogether by the end of the week.\n\nWide receiver Zay Flowers, center Tyler Linderbaum, and John Jenkins were all added to the injury report on Thursday. Flowers has a neck injury, which is always cause for concern, though it did not stop him from practicing in full. Linderbaum was limited by a knee injury, while Jenkins was absent due to an illness.\n\nAbsences from Flowers and Linderbaum would be huge losses for the Ravens offense, especially heading into a matchup with the Patriots’ top-10 defense. Both will be important to monitor on Friday’s injury report.\n\nHere is the Ravens’ full Thursday injury report (* denotes change in status):\n\nLB Jay Higgins (knee, designated to return from injured reserve)\n\nLT Ronnie Stanley (knee/ankle) *\n\nThe Ravens have not yet placed Buchanan on injured reserve. That move should come later in the week; the team may be waiting to see if Higgins is ready to be activated from his own IR stint. The undrafted rookie is in the first week of his 21-day return window and may need some more time to ramp up.\n\nAn absence from Awuzie is a real possibility after two straight missed practices, which would put T.J. Tampa in a bigger role. The second-year cornerback has held up when asked to play this year, though he has only seen extended time in two games.\n\nHarbaugh said that veterans like Stanley, Smith, and presumably Van Noy were dealing with the typical late-season wear-and-tear and needed some extra rest on Wednesday. The returns of all three on Thursday bodes well for their availability this weekend.\n\nBateman is on track to return from his one-game absence, while Keondre Jackson and Okoye are unlikely to miss any time at all.\n\nThe Patriots’ injury report featured upgraded statuses for two players. Defensive tackle Christian Barmore (non-injury related/other) and linebacker Christian Elliss (illness) both returned to practice after missing Wednesday’s session. Cornerbacks Carlton Davis (hip) and Marcus Jones (knee) and linebackers Harold Landry (knee) and Robert Spillane (ankle) all logged their second absences in a row. All four starters could miss Sunday’s matchup in Baltimore, which would be a major boost to an offense that has struggled against elite defenses this year.",

    "fullText": "When the Golden State Warriors return to the court on Thursday night, they will be without a pair of key rotational pieces against the Phoenix Suns. The Warriors will be missing veteran big man Al Horford and guard Pat Spencer on Thursday night in Phoenix.\n\nHorford has been missing time with a sciatica injury. Horford has missed seven of the last eight games, including four straight. Thursday night will be his fifth straight missed game. ESPN's Nick Friedell reports that Horford is still around another week away from returning from to the court as he continues to rehab from his sciatica injury.\n\nHorford said he is feeling better in his rehab — but he thinks he’s probably another week away from returning as he continues to deal with a sciatica issue.\n\n— Nick Friedell (@NickFriedell) December 18, 2025\n\nHorford has played 13 games in his first season for the Warriors, averaging 5.6 points on 32.1% shooting from the field and 29.8% from deep to go along with 4.4 rebounds per contest.\n\nWhile Horford is out on Thursday with his sciatica injury, Spencer is ruled out against the Suns for personal reasons. With Spencer and Horford out, Steve Kerr will have to lean on Golden State's depth, with players like Quinten Post, Brandin Podziemski, De'Anthony Melton and Gary Payton II potentially seeing a bigger role on Thursday night in Phoenix.\n\nThe Warriors will tip off against the Suns at 6 p.m. PT on Thursday night in the desert.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Warriors Wire! \n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Injury Report: Al Horford, Pat Spencer out vs. Suns",

The immediate future has the Buffalo Bills coming to town looking to build their playoff resume, while Browns fans hope for 2026 NFL draft positioning and another chance for QB Shedeur Sanders to prove something.\n\nThe first injury report of the week was loaded with players sitting out, a majority on the home team’s side.

He’s good on the edge. He’s fast. He’s played inside a little bit. He’s played on the edge.”\n\nGainer recorded 27 tackles and 2.5 sacks in his one season at UNC. He finished his college career with 237 total tackles.\n\n“He played inside at Florida State, if I remember, in college,” Maye said. “He moved to the edge once he got to North Carolina. So, I know he was with Vegas, and it’s good to see him back. I think everybody’s just trying to see what they can do just to help us, whether it’s on game day, throughout practice or whatever he can do.”\n\nGainer appeared in 17 games as a rookie with the Las Vegas Raiders, playing mostly in a special teams capacity. The 25-year-old provides good size to the practice squad and a great motor, according to Maye.\n\n“I know he’s going to work hard, and I know he’s got a good work ethic,” Maye said.\n\nMike Vrabel-Bashing Radio Host Shreds Patriots Coach Amid Josh McDaniels Debate",

The deal reportedly contains $40 million in guaranteed money.\n\nThe 29-year-old was originally slated to hit free agency after this season, which he began as a member of the Las Vegas Raiders. He had asked for a trade from the team during the offseason and finally got one to Jacksonville at the trade deadline.\n\nThe Jaguars gave up fourth- and sixth-round picks for Meyers and got a reliable receiver. Meyers posted his first career 1,000-receiving yard season last year in Vegas and has followed it up with 707 yards this season, 355 of them in six games with the Jaguars. His tenure in Jacksonville has also coincided with a 5-1 run for the team, which leads the AFC South with a 10-4 record.\n\nA $20 million average annual value places Meyers 25th among current wide receiver contracts via OverTheCap, right behind Tampa Bay Buccaneers star Mike Evans.",

    "fullText": "Tennessee radio personality Jared Stillman has become a notorious critic of New England Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel.\n\nThe Nashville-based host blasted Vrabel earlier this season when he claimed the team’s 8-2 start should be credited to the addition of offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, not the head coaching change.\n\nNow he is back at it, this time claiming Vrabel is “itching” to get rid of McDaniels so that he can hire one of his previous coordinators.\n\n“I know Vrabel-ese, and I know Mike Vrabel,” Stillman said. “I assume that Mike Vrabel is just itching to get Josh McDaniels out of there so that he can hire one of his loser buddies like Todd Downing or Tim Kelly. I can feel it!\n\n“And you can call me a hater or whatever you want to call me, I can just sense it.”\n\nStillman went on to say that the only thing keeping the Patriots from winning a Super Bowl in the near future is Vrabel’s ego.\n\n“The only thing in my opinion that’s going to keep Mike Vrabel, and Drake Maye, and Josh McDaniels, from winning the Super Bowl at some point over the next five years, is Mike Vrabel’s ego,” Stillman said. “And Josh McDaniels is the epitome of the downside of the great Mike Vrabel.”\n\nStillman’s criticism centered on a moment when Vrabel was asked about McDaniels’ success as a play caller, and he answered with praise for the entire coaching staff.\n\nThat is a bad thing in Stillman’s eyes.\n\nThe self-proclaimed hater likened Vrabel’s answer to a moment when he was coaching the Tennessee Titans and was asked about the then-quarterback Wil Levis’ performance. Vrabel once again praised the entire staff, as opposed to just crediting the individual.\n\nWhich, again, apparently is a bad thing.\n\n“Josh McDaniels is a Super Bowl-winning offensive coordinator who got Mac Jones to the Pro Bowl as a rookie,” Stillman said. “And they have the 23-year-old second coming of Aaron Rodgers without the baggage and drama at quarterback. And Vrabel can’t be happy?”\n\nDrake Maye Raves About Former North Carolina Teammate After Patriots Signing",

    "description": "In the suit, McPhee says she was placed on leave to stop her from testifying before a federal grand injury investigating the NFLPA and the Major League Baseball Players Association, according to ESPN's report.",
    "fullText": "Heather McPhee, associate general counsel for the NFL Players Association since 2009, filed a federal lawsuit Thursday, alleging that former executive director Lloyd Howell Jr. and two current top union executives conspired to prevent her from cooperating with a criminal investigation into union finances, as reported by ESPN's Don Van Natta Jr.\n\nMcPhee was placed on paid administrative leave on Aug. 14 after she was the subject of multiple employee complaints, per Van Natta and ESPN's Jeff Passan, that reportedly included accusations of failing to follow supervisors' directions, bullying colleagues and disrupting the union's work environment.\n\nIn the suit, McPhee says she was placed on leave to stop her from testifying before a federal grand injury investigating the NFLPA and the Major League Baseball Players Association, according to ESPN's report.\n\nMonths before she was placed on leave, she made allegations that sparked an FBI investigation into the NFLPA, the MLBPA and OneTeam Partners, their $2 billion licensing company.\n\nMcPhee is reportedly seeking at least $10 million in damages, according to the suit, in which she accuses Howell of illegal misconduct, sex discrimination, breach of fiduciary duty and retaliation, per ESPN.\n\nHowell, who became the NFLPA's executive director in 2022, resigned on July 17. He stepped down after a tumultuous month of criticism that stemmed from Pablo Torre and Mike Florio reporting that the NFL and NFLPA covered up a ruling on a collusion grievance. An arbitrator, Christopher Droney, found that, in the wake of Deshaun Watson signing a fully-guaranteed $230 million contract with the Cleveland Browns ahead of the 2022 season, league executives encouraged team owners to reduce the amount of guaranteed money players received in subsequent contracts.\n\nDroney, though, concluded that he couldn't prove by a \"clear preponderance\" that NFL teams followed suit. Still, the details revealed from that 2022 annual owners' meeting were indelible, and so was the fact that the NFLPA reportedly agreed with the NFL to keep the collusion grievance findings under wraps. That left a stain on Howell's reputation, as did other matters, chief among them his reported spending of union funds for visits to strip clubs.\n\nAfter McPhee initially flagged concerns within the NFLPA in November 2024 regarding senior executives potentially violating labor laws governing conflicts of interest and the fulfillment of fiduciary duties, as reported by ESPN, she alleges that union leaders targeted her \"in order to conceal and deflect their own misconduct and failures.\"\n\nMcPhee questioned the legality of a senior executive incentive plan proposed by OneTeam Partners that would have paid millions of dollars in bonuses to Howell, MLBPA executive director Tony Clark and others, per ESPN, which also reported that McPhee states in the suit that she opposed Howell's decision to keep the collusion grievance findings secret.\n\nThe suit says, according to ESPN, that the union leaders signing a confidentiality agreement with the NFL \"raised concerns about a potential violation of the NFLPA's duty of fair representation to players.\"\n\nWhen union leaders discovered McPhee was in line to testify as a grand jury witness about what she deemed to be criminal misconduct by Howell and others, she alleges she was removed from meetings and cut off from the board and players.\n\nShe was then placed on leave due to her \"workplace behavior.\" McPhee believes that was a tactic to prevent her from cooperating with the DOJ.",

    "description": "Rutgers Wrestling falls against a ranked Oklahoma team, picks up win over Drexel.",
    "fullText": "The Rutgers wrestling team split its weekend matches, falling to then-No. 20 Oklahoma 19-14 but beating unranked Drexel 28-12. Oklahoma’s win saw them jump up into the No.15 spot according to the NWCA Coaches Poll. The Scarlet Knights were ranked at No.12 before moving down to No.19.\n\nDespite the result, Rutgers got off to a really hot start in their dual against Oklahoma. The Knights took home four victories in the first six bouts and built an 11-6 lead heading into the final four. This run was highlighted by a No. 13/9 Dylan Shawver major decision over Carter Schmidt,13-3, and a No. 26/28 Anthony White Major decision over Layton Schneider, 8-0. Unfortunately for the Knights, their run would stop here. Rutgers was beaten in four straight bouts, allowing Oklahoma to secure victory. Both 174-pounder No. 9/4 Lenny Pinto and HWT No.22/19 Hunter Catka fought their opponent tough, but neither could find a way to pull off a victory against their ranked opponents.\n\nFormer Knight and 184-pounder No.11 Brian Soldano found his way back to the banks for this match after becoming a Sooner. He delivered Oklahoma a 9-6 decision over No. 15/18 Shane Cartagena-Walsh.\n\nThe heavier weights for Rutgers, who struggled against Oklahoma, fared much better against Drexel. The Knights finished the duel with five straight wins and seven wins overall. This streak was highlighted by Pinto securing a fall over No.18/13 Jesiah Queen, Cartagena-Walsh securing a major decision over Ethan Wilson, 18/16 197-pounder Remy Cotton securing a major decision over No.31 Ibrahim Ameer, and Catka securing a tech fall over Dom Petracci to cement Rutgers 16 point win.\n\nThe season as a whole started strong for Rutgers. The Knights started 5-0 in the duals, cruising over schools like Centenary, Gardner-Webb, Bloomsburg, Navy, and Davidson. The team also took home first place in the Keystone Classic, where Pinto, 141-pounder Joseph Olivieri, and 125-pounder Ayden Smith brought home individual titles for their weight class. Rutgers would finish the tournament with 159 team points. The next highest was Penn at 140 team points.\n\nHowever, once Rutgers played No.10 NC State and No.20 Oklahoma, they struggled, dropping both duals in tough fashion. Despite their win over unranked Drexel, things will only get harder for the Knights from here, as their next dual is a date with No.1 Penn State in Happy Valley to kick off conference play, one week before No.13 Michigan comes to town. The Big Ten is widely regarded as the best conference in wrestling, so Rutgers will have to step up and win some ranked duals to show that it still deserves to be a ranked program itself.\n\nThe first bout for the Knights in their match at Penn State will be at 4 pm on January 10th.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams will be without wide receiver Davante Adams for the Week 16 game against the Seattle Seahawks, which will have huge playoff implications.\n\nAdams landed on the injury report once again this week with a hamstring issue. He was on the Week 15 injury report with the hamstring, also, but aggravated the issue and was forced to exit last week's game early.\n\nAdams didn't practice at all this week before drawing the doubtful tag and being ruled out on Thursday night ahead of kickoff.\n\nHere's what we know about his return timeline.\n\nAt this point, Adams should be considered week to week.\n\nAdams' injury isn't a season-ending issue, so he will be back at some point. When that is, remains to be seen.\n\nNFL Network's Ian Rapoport said earlier on Thursday that the hope is Adams could return next week, but that is far from certain.\n\n\"So, don't expect him to play tonight, but the hope is, next game, if there's enough time to recover, we could see Davante out there.\"\n\nBut, earlier in the week, Rapoport floated the possibility that Adams could miss the rest of the regular season with his hamstring injury.\n\n\"There are only a couple types of injuries this time of year: there's an injury where a guy is fine, there's an injury where he's back for the playoffs, and then he's done,\" Rapoport said. \"The hope is that this is one of those he's back for the playoffs.\"\n\nWhat Adams has going for him next week is the Rams will enjoy a mini-bye thanks to their Thursday night game in Week 16, giving him 11 days with Los Angeles playing on Monday night in Week 17.\n\nAnother positive for Adams was his ability to do at least some work in pre-game warm-ups on Thursday night.\n\nWe should get our next update on Adams at the top of next week, but if not it won't come any later than Thursday, when Los Angeles drops its first injury report of the week.\n\nWhy CeeDee Lamb's 2 missed practices aren't a concern for Week 16\n\nQuinn Ewers can end 21-year drought for Texas quarterbacks\n\nBroncos' NFL record could be shattered by Dolphins in 2026\n\nWhat Patrick Mahomes tearing 2 ligaments means for recovery timeline\n\nJaguars offense in midst of streak not seen in NFL this season",

    "fullText": "A little over 24 hours before Texas A&M (11-1, 7-1 SEC) hosts Miami (10-2) in the first round of the College Football Playoff, the Aggie media team, which released a tease of the uniform Texas A&M will wear, maroon jerseys, while an updated video on Thursday night provided a glimpse at the full uniform, which will rival Miami's regular white road look.\n\nAccording to the video, Texas A&M will enter Kyle Field on Saturday wearing maroon helmets, maroon jerseys, and white pants, which is the standard home look. The only exception was the blackout look against Mississippi State earlier this season, which resulted in a 31-9 win over the Bulldogs.\n\nHowever, the Aggies tricked all of us earlier this week after hinting at a potential blackout, which would have been a first for an early 11:00 a.m. kickoff. Still, whatever the Aggies wear isn't going to magically help this team get past the Hurricanes, who will field one of the best defenses in the country, and one of the more electrifying playmakers in freshman wide receiver Malachi Toney.\n\nHead coach Mike Elko is hoping that playing at home three weeks after losing to Texas on the road to end the regular season is the recipe for success, paired with a solid week of practice. The news is that star running back Le'Veon Moss, who has missed the last six games due to an ankle injury, is \"questionable\" to play on Saturday. At the same time, senior linebacker Scooby Williams and safety Bryce Anderson are \"probable\" with 75% chance to take the field.\n\nEither way, Texas A&M's best path to facing Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl is for starting quarterback Marcel Reed to play at an elite level, both in the pocket and with his legs, against a Miami defensive line led by Rueben Bain, who is looking to ruin the Aggies' offensive game plan.\n\nEvery era has led to this. #GigEm | #BTHOmiami pic.twitter.com/3zcz2bRZwp\n\n— Texas A&M Football (@AggieFootball) December 18, 2025\n\nTexas A&M will host Miami on Saturday at 11:00 a.m. with coverage on ABC and ESPN.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M will wear maroon/maroon/white vs. Miami in the CFP",

    "description": "On getting lucky, making mistakes, and what's next.",
    "fullText": "it's a privilege to write a piece with this title. so before jumping in, thank you.\n\nbelow is a recap of the incredible year we had at TRMNL. how we got lucky, mistakes made along the way, and what's next.\n\ni live in a small town. when asked what i do for work i reply \"IT.\" last year i joined the local Cattlemen's Association.\n\nneedless to say, TRMNL is fully remote. this year we grew from a few friends hacking on nights and weekends to 25+ across 4 continents, 6 countries, and 3 facilities. the latest one is actually under construction and i'll talk more about it later.\n\nremote has become the standard for software companies, but hardware is a bit trickier. in the future i'd like more face to face environments so we can move faster. in < 90 days we're hosting our first team retreat.\n\nanyway. TRMNL is proud to have dedicated support, operations, marketing, open source, and core engineering members. learn more about each person here.\n\nwe launched on Kickstarter in June 2024 with a single device, the TRMNL OG. i always wanted to legally name something OG and now governments around the globe have our EC licenses filed in their digital coffers.\n\nour firmware runs on ESP32s, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and beyond. you can even run TRMNL in your browser (Chrome, Firefox) or join 1,500+ people using our web app with their own hardware. which by design we have no way of even detecting.\n\nto meet customer demand in 2025 we rebuilt our Framework UI kit, render pipeline, and firmware. perhaps most important, this year we improved our utility with 100s of new plugins. in January 2025 we had ~60, today we have over 700. nearly 90% of publicly listed TRMNL plugins are built and maintained by the TRMNL community.\n\ni should have put this section at the top.\n\nTRMNL exists because most products do not respect the most valuable currency: our attention. most products do not respect privacy. most products stop working when the maker says \"i quit.\" most products cannot be self-repaired. most products need to charge every weekend.\n\nour vision is to help you stay focused in an increasingly distracting world. we do that with ambient technology, as few emails and notifications as possible, and a thoughtful team who cares.\n\nas a rule we don't kiss and tell, but here's what i can share: 10s of 1000s of homes and offices use TRMNL.\n\nwe got here without a single ad on Facebook or Instagram or Ticky Tocky. our \"analytics stack\" is a free dashboard, visible to all. should i lock that down?\n\nthese outcomes let us provide for our families and make TRMNL better every day at $0 additional cost to customers.\n\nif one day we stop getting lucky, we'll open source everything.\n\ni've never run a hardware company. i've never made products for consumers, or used Discord, or written C++. before TRMNL i sold (mostly boring) B2B software.\n\nso this year i learned to depend on a team of specialists who dream and bring ideas to fruition. but we (i) didn't get everything right. here are some of those blunders:\n\nin each case we found a solution, but with more experience we could have avoided spending the Good Will reserves.\n\ni'll posit that a single theme carried us through the mistakes: ownership.\n\nwhen TRMNL screws up we don't hide it. we invite the community to help make it right and we observe Hammurabi's Code. our engineers are available on live chat nearly 24 hours a day. some companies behave otherwise. but TRMNL customers are smart, and smart people have sophisticated BS detectors. as mom always said: do not insult the hand that feeds you.\n\nanother scary endeavor in 2025 was bootstrapping our own logistics network and warehouse tech. TRMNL runs 2 facilities, with a 3rd underway, where all devices are assembled and shipped by our team. call me old fashioned, but it's important that my desk is just a few steps from a packing station.\n\nfinally, we started investing in the community via the Creator Fund. over $20,000 has been distributed in its first 2 months and we couldn't be happier with downstream effects. whether you write code, speak another language, or design 3D models, TRMNL wants to reward you for making a difference.\n\nbeyond the usual suspects of pushing bugs directly to master or waiting 5 months to implement a popular feature request, a few grey swans appeared.\n\nwe mitigated each issue with smart people and debate-driven solutions. some of our tariff bills are still frozen by UPS. every lost shipment or damaged device was replaced at our expense.\n\nand this is kind of the other side of entrepreneurship generally. every team shows up when things are good. the measure of an organization's resolve is whether they keep hacking when things go wrong.\n\nmark my words: more is coming out than has come out.\n\nfrom products to features, enterprise solutions, even better pricing, federating the open source ecosystem, IRL events...\n\na few teasers. i intend to launch our 3rd product in-person, Spring 2026 at our Berlin warehouse. customers in the region will receive a physical invitation in the mail.\n\nwe're grateful for the opportunity you gave us in 2025. it's our turn to give back in 2026. to those who celebrate, Merry Christmas and happy New Year.",

    "description": "Physicist doubts work like Higgs boson identification achievable now as academics are expected to 'keep churning out papers'",
    "fullText": "Peter Higgs, the British physicist who gave his name to the Higgs boson, believes no university would employ him in today's academic system because he would not be considered \"productive\" enough.\n\nThe emeritus professor at Edinburgh University, who says he has never sent an email, browsed the internet or even made a mobile phone call, published fewer than 10 papers after his groundbreaking work, which identified the mechanism by which subatomic material acquires mass, was published in 1964.\n\nHe doubts a similar breakthrough could be achieved in today's academic culture, because of the expectations on academics to collaborate and keep churning out papers. He said: \"It's difficult to imagine how I would ever have enough peace and quiet in the present sort of climate to do what I did in 1964.\"\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian en route to Stockholm to receive the 2013 Nobel prize for science, Higgs, 84, said he would almost certainly have been sacked had he not been nominated for the Nobel in 1980.\n\nEdinburgh University's authorities then took the view, he later learned, that he \"might get a Nobel prize – and if he doesn't we can always get rid of him\".\n\nHiggs said he became \"an embarrassment to the department when they did research assessment exercises\". A message would go around the department saying: \"Please give a list of your recent publications.\" Higgs said: \"I would send back a statement: 'None.' \"\n\nHiggs revealed that his career had also been jeopardised by his disagreements in the 1960s and 70s with the then principal, Michael Swann, who went on to chair the BBC. Higgs objected to Swann's handling of student protests and to the university's shareholdings in South African companies during the apartheid regime. \"[Swann] didn't understand the issues, and denounced the student leaders.\"\n\nHe regrets that the particle he identified in 1964 became known as the \"God particle\".\n\nHe said: \"Some people get confused between the science and the theology. They claim that what happened at Cern proves the existence of God.\"\n\nAn atheist since the age of 10, he fears the nickname \"reinforces confused thinking in the heads of people who are already thinking in a confused way. If they believe that story about creation in seven days, are they being intelligent?\"\n\nHe also revealed that he turned down a knighthood in 1999. \"I'm rather cynical about the way the honours system is used, frankly. A whole lot of the honours system is used for political purposes by the government in power.\"\n\nHe has not yet decided which way he will vote in the referendum on Scottish independence. \"My attitude would depend a little bit on how much progress the lunatic right of the Conservative party makes in trying to get us out of Europe. If the UK were threatening to withdraw from Europe, I would certainly want Scotland to be out of that.\"\n\nHe has never been tempted to buy a television, but was persuaded to watch The Big Bang Theory last year, and said he wasn't impressed.",

    "description": "Read this article on the Lovable blog",
    "fullText": "Today, we're announcing that Lovable has raised $330 million in Series B funding at a $6.6 billion valuation, led by CapitalG and Menlo Ventures' Anthology fund.\n\nAdditional investors in this round include the venture arms of leading companies building the future of work: NVentures (NVIDIA’s venture capital arm), Salesforce Ventures, Databricks Ventures, T.Capital (Deutsche Telekom), Atlassian Ventures, and HubSpot Ventures. They’re joined by Khosla Ventures, DST Global, EQT Growth, Kinship Ventures, and returning investors Accel, Creandum, and Evantic, among others.\n\nWe launched Lovable to empower the 99% — the people who've had ideas but lacked the technical skills to bring them to life. Now, we're watching a transformation unfold in real time.\n\nA new category of people has emerged: builders. They're the product manager who wants to show, not just tell. The marketer with projects stuck in engineering backlogs. The ops team using outdated software for internal tooling. The nurse who sees a better way to visualize patient journeys. The artist in need of a website with an e-commerce platform integration—in time for the holidays. The founder turning a side hustle into the main thing.\n\nAnd they're building at a scale we never imagined:\n\nLet’s look at what builders are doing in large enterprises, like Klarna and Deutsche Telekom:\n\nJorge Luthe, Senior Director of Product at Zendesk:\n\nThanks to Lovable’s rapid prototyping and real-time collaboration capabilities, we’ve dramatically streamlined our product development process. What once took six weeks — from idea to working prototype — now takes just three hours. This shift has enabled our product management, UX, and engineering teams to collaborate faster and more effectively than ever before.\n\nShipping real products in production:\n\nDharmin Parikh, Director of Product at Uber AI:\n\nLovable makes it easy for our teams to create interactive prototypes and move from idea to decision with less friction.\n\nJonathan Abrahamson, Chief Product and Digital Officer at Deutsche Telekom:\n\nAI is transforming how enterprises build and validate products. For a 2,000-person product & engineering organization, this goes far beyond faster prototypes. It demands a new approach to how the best ideas come to life. Lovable shares that perspective, and their vision pairs naturally with how we will develop and ship products at Deutsche Telekom.\n\nAnd founders are building new businesses, too:\n\nThis investment accelerates our work in three key areas:\n\nDeeper integrations. Builders don't work in isolation. They use Notion for docs, Linear for tickets, Jira for sprints, Miro for brainstorms. Lovable already connects to these tools, and we're going deeper — so the context you've already built informs what you create next.\n\nEnhanced collaboration and governance. As more teams adopt Lovable, they need the features enterprises expect. We're continuing to invest in making Lovable ready for organizations of every size.\n\nInfrastructure to take products from prototype to production. Lovable isn't just for demos. With built-in hosting, databases, authentication, and payments, people ship real products — not just mockups. We're continuing to build out the capabilities that make this possible.\n\nHere’s why these firms are working with Lovable.\n\nLaela Sturdy, Managing Partner at CapitalG:\n\nLovable has done something rare: built a product that enterprises and founders both love. The demand we're seeing from Fortune 500 companies signals a fundamental shift in how software gets built. We're proud to lead this round and support Lovable's vision of making software creation accessible to everyone.\n\nMatt Murphy, Partner at Menlo Ventures:\n\nLovable is a beloved product for all the right reasons. They've done what was previously unimaginable by turning a latent market of tens of millions of people into web developers and content creators. We love category builders like our previous early investments in Uber and Anthropic—companies that have the opportunity to be enormous. Lovable is showing exactly that trajectory.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow, Co-founder and General Partner at Kinship Ventures:\n\nWhat makes Lovable compelling is how accessible it is to non-technical founders. You don’t need to write code to get started—you need clarity of thought. Imagine that idea scrawled on the back of a napkin can magically turn into a working prototype with a real codebase with just one sentence. That’s what Lovable unlocks for founders. Lovable gives founders a new kind of agency and confidence. And, most importantly, speed. That shift is deeply aligned with how we think about empowerment at Kinship.\n\nThis is the age of the builder. A seismic shift in what's possible. The story belongs to the teachers, product managers, founders, and dreamers who now have the tools to bring their ideas to life. See their stories.",

    "title": "Trump Is Doubling Down on His Disastrous A.I. Chip Policy",
    "description": "National security shouldn’t ever have a price.",
    "fullText": "President Trump announced last week that he would allow China to buy an advanced artificial intelligence chip, the H200, from the American company Nvidia, doubling down on a misguided decision he made over the summer to sell China another advanced chip, the H20. The H200 is about six times as powerful and will be an even greater boon to China’s military and A.I. development.\n\nMr. Trump explained that in return, the U.S. government will charge a 25 percent fee on all sales of the H200. But U.S. national security and technological dominance shouldn’t ever have a price — let alone such a low one.\n\nFor years, both the Trump and Biden administrations had successfully sought as large a lead as possible over China in A.I. In 2018, the first Trump administration wisely cut off key companies in China from the most advanced chip-making equipment. In 2020, Mr. Trump helped reverse the deployment of nonsecure Chinese 5G telecommunications networks by Britain and other allies by banning the sale of advanced chips to the Chinese tech giant Huawei. The Biden administration substantially expanded those controls and added new ones. Both administrations said that China would use American-made chips to develop more sophisticated A.I. and modernize its military.\n\nHampered by those policies, China has struggled to make advanced A.I. chips, despite a push of around $200 billion starting in 2014. None of China’s chips are close to matching the capacity of the H200. Huawei, a leading Chinese chipmaker, projects that it will not be able to match the H200’s performance until the end of 2027 at the earliest — and even that estimate sounds optimistic.\n\nIn addition to making less capable chips, China struggles to make them in large quantities. Trump administration officials testified in June that China will make just 200,000 chips per year — not even enough for a single data center. By contrast, Taiwan, the United States and the rest of the democratic world will produce more than 10 million far-superior chips per year. All told, China will produce a total computing power that is a mere 1 percent to 3 percent of what U.S. companies will produce.\n\nThe chief executive of DeepSeek, a prominent A.I. company in China, admitted in 2024 that access to chips was the company’s biggest impediment. In the summer of 2025, DeepSeek reportedly tried and failed to train a new system on Chinese chips. When DeepSeek released its latest model several weeks ago, it acknowledged that the system still lags behind U.S. versions and cited computing limitations as the key reason.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump’s announcement last week, Chinese companies jumped at the chance to buy the H200 — more evidence that America’s chip advantage is real.\n\nThe Trump administration argues that selling chips to China will keep China “addicted” to American products and undermine its efforts to improve production. But China knows better. In the days since Mr. Trump announced his decision to sell the H200, there have been reports that China will invest an additional $70 billion to improve its domestic production of chips. According to a report on Sunday in the Global Times, which is controlled by China’s ruling party, Nvidia’s advanced chips would be used only until Chinese tech companies can transition to domestic alternatives.\n\nIt’s all part of the same pattern, whether the product is solar panels, electric vehicles or telecommunications: China imports Western technology until its own production catches up; then it cuts out American companies. President Xi Jinping has long said that relying on others for core technology “is like building a house on someone else’s foundation.”\n\nIt should be obvious that the United States should not sell China advanced technology that China could use to target American troops and intelligence officers. Advanced A.I. will improve China’s cyber operations, intelligence analysis and weaponry. According to reports, the Trump White House has concluded that Alibaba, one of China’s biggest A.I. companies, provides technology support for the Chinese military, including some of its operations against U.S. targets. (Alibaba has denied this claim.) Other reports suggest that DeepSeek evades U.S. export controls and aids Chinese military and intelligence operations. Chinese procurement documents show that the People’s Liberation Army is also trying to get its hands on advanced U.S. chips.\n\nThe bipartisan House committee on China was right when it said last week that China will use the H200 to “strengthen its military capabilities and totalitarian surveillance,” and when it recommended tightening export controls rather than loosening them.\n\nThe Trump administration is well aware of how much A.I. matters to national security, which makes its decision even more baffling. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, last week proclaimed, “The future of American warfare is here, and it’s spelled ‘A.I.’” And when the Department of Justice recently announced charges against two individuals accused of smuggling H200s to China, it underscored the national security issues: “These chips are the building blocks of A.I. superiority and are integral to modern military applications. The country that controls these chips will control A.I. technology; the country that controls A.I. technology will control the future.”\n\nFor now, that country is the United States. In 2017, Li Keqiang, China’s premier at the time, told Mr. Trump during a meeting in Beijing that China would come to dominate all technologies, including A.I., and that America would export little more than soybeans and corn. Last week’s decision helps make that unlikely dream a reality.\n\nBen Buchanan is an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies and an adviser to A.I. and cybersecurity companies.

    "description": "This post will introduce a tutorial on how to build an app for ChatGPT using Apollo Client and Apollo MCP Server. You’ll have what you need to get started with our opinionated stack for building these apps.",
    "fullText": "Building Apps for ChatGPT with Apollo MCP Server and Apollo Client\n\nIn early October, OpenAI introduced the ChatGPT Apps SDK with a handful of launch partners. These “apps” could be invoked by ChatGPT via Model Context Protocol (MCP) and would be embedded directly into the ChatGPT interface. In their intro video, they showed use cases like asking for flights, hotel locations, house listings, and more, including teasing the idea of asking follow up questions to ChatGPT.\n\nImagine your application being part of the conversation, allowing the user to ask follow up questions, and having your app be responsive to those questions. These are action-oriented conversational apps where the LLM can take action on behalf of a user with rich interactive UIs.\n\nThis idea quickly caught fire, and now the MCP apps spec is proposing a standardized approach to create these kinds of experiences, with other AI vendors sure to follow suit. We’re excited about the potential here, and are working on tools to abstract away all of the AI provider details from you with a great developer experience, allowing you to focus on building your app instead of worrying about vendor idiosyncrasies and evolving standards.\n\nWe want this to be a true “build once” solution where you can deploy your app anywhere that supports one of the protocols that we will support. This way, you don’t need to host a separate MCP Server, and build a separate app, for every provider and sub-protocol that emerges.\n\nYou can instead focus on your customers.\n\nThis post will introduce a tutorial on how to build an app for ChatGPT using Apollo Client and Apollo MCP Server. By the end of it, you’ll have what you need to get started with our opinionated stack for building these apps. If you prefer to dive into the template and follow along, you can find the repo here.\n\nBased on the OpenAI documentation and examples, to build one of these apps you would:\n\nWe don’t want you to have to do any of this. You shouldn’t have to focus on any of the inner workings of this sub-protocol, or even think about MCP. Your front-end engineers shouldn’t have a new dependency on your platform engineers. Instead, you should be able to focus on building exciting and compelling experiences for your customers.\n\nInstead of this feeling like learning 100% how to build apps from scratch, this should be 90% reusing what you already know about building apps, and 10% learning about the specifics of this new paradigm.\n\nWe wanted to make this as easy as possible and decided to reach for tools that are already familiar to many of our users: Apollo MCP Server and Apollo Client. If you want to follow along in this tutorial, you can find all the code in our OpenAI Apps SDK demo.\n\nTo build this app we have two components: a React app and Apollo MCP Server. This solution works without any additional MCP Server configuration. The client gets to focus on their application, not the MCP server configuration.\n\nStarting in our main.tsx file, we create an ApolloClient instance and ApolloProvider, very similar to how we would on a traditional React app, but we’re going to import them from @apollo/client-ai-apps instead of the normal location. This is an Apollo Client integration package, similar to @apollo/client-nextjs. This allows us to do a lot of setup and details behind the scenes of dealing with data being exchanged over MCP.\n\nNow we can use the normal useQuery and useMutation hooks as we normally would!\n\nFor example, I can write a component that gets my TOP_PRODUCTS:\n\nLooks pretty normal, but what is that @tool directive on the operation? That is allowing you to declare in your app a tool that will be exposed to the LLM, including a name and description. At the same time, we are registering the operation that will be executed when this tool is called (and therefore the data that should be delivered as part of this tool), and the graphql variables become the input schema for the tool!\n\nThis is really exciting because we’re able to declare so much with so little code. Also, these are on-the-fly tool declarations. I don’t need a platform team to create these tools for me on an MCP server!\n\nAnother important aspect of this solution is showing the right component based on what tool was called by the LLM. It turns out we’ve had this problem solved for years now with React Router!\n\nTo do this, we provide a useToolEffect hook, which works the same way as a useEffect, but allows you to run the effect based on which tool was executed.\n\nUsing this hook, and a very familiar navigate function from react-router, I can express that when the “Top Products” tool is called, I should navigate to the /home view.\n\nThe magic of this solution really comes from a custom Vite plugin called the ApplicationManifestPlugin which extracts all the operations, tools, and metadata from your React app and generates a .application-manifest.json file:\n\nThis plugin runs during dev and build time and generates a file that looks something like this:\n\nWhat you’ll see contained in this manifest is everything that the Apollo MCP Server needs to automatically generate the resource and tools for your app. There’s no need to create or configure any of this on the MCP Server. It will automatically pick it up based on your manifest file.\n\nAnd that’s it! You can build your React app and declare tools alongside the data declarations and the tooling will do the rest. At the time this post was written, you would then test your app in ChatGPT using developer mode. OpenAI outlines how to try the app in their documentation.\n\nWith the MCP apps spec hot off the press, and likely other providers working on an answer to ChatGPT’s AppsSDK, we have a very important goal: To abstract away all of the provider details from you with a great developer experience, allowing you to focus on building your app instead.\n\nWe want this to be a true “build once” solution where you can deploy your app anywhere that supports one of the protocols that we will support. This way, you don’t need to host a separate MCP Server, and build a separate app, for every provider and sub-protocol that emerges.\n\nYou can instead focus on your customers.\n\nThis solution is exciting for platform engineers because it doesn’t require them being in the loop and becoming a blocker for the frontend teams they are looking to empower. A single Apollo MCP Server powers apps across providers and accelerates platform engineering. For frontend engineers, this removes the burden of sub-protocol concerns and lets them focus on building high-quality user experiences.\n\nIt’s important to note that these apps are still very, very early.\n\nRemember many, many years ago when “apps” first appeared on the iPhone? Many people didn’t understand why they needed a mobile app when they already had a website. It’s kind of funny looking back now because we had no idea what we were even looking at or how much it would change and shape our future.\n\nThat’s about where we are now with these conversational chat apps. Customers and companies alike don’t yet “get” these apps. The app store just launched. But once these things fall into place, and we hit an industry mind share, we believe we’re going to see an explosion of conversational, chat-based applications.\n\nTry out building apps for ChatGPT today with Apollo Client and Apollo MCP Server by going to our Template Repo and following the README. We’d love to hear what you think.",

    "description": "Apple says it can now collect any money a developer owes the tech giant at any time.",
    "fullText": "Apple on Wednesday released an updated developer license agreement that gives the company permission to recoup unpaid funds, such as commissions or any other fees, by deducting them from in-app purchases it processes on developers’ behalf, among other methods.\n\nThe change will impact developers in regions where local law allows them to link to external payment systems. In these cases, developers must report those payments back to Apple to pay the required commissions or fees.\n\nThe changed agreement seemingly gives Apple a way to collect what it believes is the correct fee if the company determines a developer has underreported their earnings.\n\nApple’s policies in this area are complex, but the change could impact developers in markets like the EU, U.S., and, now, Japan, where developers using external payment systems may be required to pay Apple varying fees or commissions depending on local law. (In the U.S., the legality of these commissions is still being disputed. A federal appeals court earlier this month ruled that a district court should consider allowing Apple to collect some commission, though not the full 27% fee it previously charged.)\n\nIn its new developer agreement, Apple states it will “offset or recoup” what it believes it is owed, including “any amounts collected by Apple on your behalf from end-users.” This means Apple could recoup funds from developers’ in-app purchases — like those for digital goods, services, and subscriptions — or from one-time fees for paid applications.\n\nAdditionally, Apple notes that it has the right to collect this money “at any time” and “from time to time,” meaning developers could face surprise deductions if Apple believes they’ve miscalculated what they owe.\n\nThe agreement doesn’t specify how Apple will determine whether it’s owed money.\n\nThe types of developer payments that vary over time are limited and include commissions, fees, and taxes. Among these is the Core Technology Fee (CTF) in the EU, which currently costs €0.50 for each first annual install exceeding one million in the past 12 months. In January 2026, Apple will transition from the CTF to a new fee, called the Core Technology Commission (CTC), a more complicated percentage-based fee. Apple will collect the CTC from apps that use external payment methods or are distributed under its alternative business terms for the EU.\n\nThe updated developer agreement also gives Apple the right to collect unpaid amounts from any “affiliates, parents, or subsidiaries” related to the account that owes money. In practical terms, that means Apple could collect the money from developers’ other apps, or from apps published by a parent company.\n\nThese changes are detailed in Schedules 2 and 3, section 3.4, which focuses on the delivery of applications to end users.\n\nThese are not the only modifications to the agreement. Apple is also introducing sections devoted to its age assurance technology, new terms for iOS apps in Japan, and other requirements.\n\nOf interest, Apple is defining requirements for voice-based assistants (like AI chatbots) that are activated via the side button on the iPhone and is banning recordings made without user awareness. This includes audio and video recordings, as well as screen recordings, which are often used by developers to identity issues users face when navigating apps or to locate bugs.\n\nTo be clear, Apple isn’t banning these recordings outright. The company is simply adding language that says: “Your Application may not be designed to facilitate Recordings of others without their awareness.” How Apple will interpret that rule remains to be seen.\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment ahead of publication.",

    "fullText": "Margaret Elaine Hamilton (née Heafield; born August 17, 1936) is an American computer scientist. She directed the Software Engineering Division at the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, where she led the development of the on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo Guidance Computer for the Apollo program. She later founded two software companies, Higher Order Software in 1976 and Hamilton Technologies in 1986, both in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nHamilton has published more than 130 papers, proceedings, and reports, about sixty projects, and six major programs. She coined the term \"software engineering\", stating, \"I began to use the term 'software engineering' to distinguish it from hardware and other kinds of engineering, yet treat each type of engineering as part of the overall systems engineering process.\"[1][2][3]\n\nOn November 22, 2016, Hamilton received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from president Barack Obama for her work leading to the development of on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo Moon missions.[4]\n\nMargaret Elaine Heafield was born August 17, 1936, in Paoli, Indiana,[5] to Kenneth Heafield and Ruth Esther Heafield (née Partington).[6][7] The family later moved to Michigan,[8] where Margaret graduated from Hancock High School in 1954.[6]\n\nShe studied mathematics at the University of Michigan in 1955 before transferring to Earlham College, where her mother had been a student.[9][10] She earned a BA in mathematics with a minor in philosophy in 1958.[9][11] She cites Florence Long, the head of the math department at Earlham, as helping with her desire to pursue abstract mathematics and become a mathematics professor.[12]\n\nShe says her poet father and headmaster grandfather inspired her to include a minor in philosophy in her studies.[13]\n\nIn Boston, Hamilton initially intended to enroll in graduate study in abstract mathematics at Brandeis University.[6] However, in mid-1959, Hamilton began working for Edward Norton Lorenz, in the meteorology department at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[14] She developed software for predicting weather, programming on the LGP-30 and the PDP-1 computers at Marvin Minsky's Project MAC.[15][16][17] Her work contributed to Lorenz's future publications on chaos theory, as acknowledged by Lorenz himself.[14] At the time, computer science and software engineering were not yet established disciplines; instead, programmers learned on the job with hands-on experience.[18] She moved on to another project in the summer of 1961, and hired and trained Ellen Fetter as her replacement.[14]\n\nFrom 1961 to 1963, Hamilton worked on the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Project at the MIT Lincoln Lab,[16] where she was one of the programmers who wrote software for the prototype AN/FSQ-7 computer (the XD-1), used by the U.S. Air Force to search for possibly unfriendly aircraft.[5] She also wrote software for a satellite tracking project at the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories.[16] The SAGE Project was an extension of Project Whirlwind, started by MIT to create a computer system that could predict weather systems and track their movements using simulators. SAGE was soon developed for military use in anti-aircraft air defense. Hamilton said:\n\nWhat they used to do when you came into this organization as a beginner, was to assign you this program which nobody was able to ever figure out or get to run. When I was the beginner they gave it to me as well. And what had happened was it was tricky programming, and the person who wrote it took delight in the fact that all of his comments were in Greek and Latin. So I was assigned this program and I actually got it to work. It even printed out its answers in Latin and Greek. I was the first one to get it to work.[19]\n\nIt was her efforts on this project that made her a candidate for the position at NASA as the lead developer for Apollo flight software.[6]\n\nHamilton learned of the Apollo project in 1965 and wanted to get involved due to it being \"very exciting\" as a Moon program.[23] She joined the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed the Apollo Guidance Computer for the Apollo lunar exploration program. Hamilton was the first programmer hired for the Apollo project at MIT and the first female programmer in the project,[23][24] and later became Director of the Software Engineering Division.[25] She was responsible for the team writing and testing all onboard in-flight software for the Apollo spacecraft's Command and Lunar Module and for the subsequent Skylab space station.[26][27][18] Another part of her team designed and developed the systems software.[28] This included error detection and recovery software such as restarts and the Display Interface Routines (also known as the Priority Displays), which Hamilton designed and developed.[29] She worked to gain hands-on experience during a time when computer science courses were uncommon and software engineering courses did not exist.[18]\n\nHer areas of expertise include systems design and software development, enterprise and process modeling, development paradigm, formal systems modeling languages, system-oriented objects for systems modeling and development, automated life-cycle environments, methods for maximizing software reliability and reuse, domain analysis, correctness by built-in language properties, open-architecture techniques for robust systems, full life-cycle automation, quality assurance, seamless integration, error detection and recovery techniques, human-machine interface systems, operating systems, end-to-end testing techniques, and life-cycle management techniques.[18][20] These techniques are intended to make code more reliable because they help programmers identify and fix errors sooner in the development process.\n\nIn one of the critical moments of the Apollo 11 mission, the Apollo Guidance Computer, together with the on-board flight software, averted an abort of the landing on the Moon. Three minutes before the lunar lander reached the Moon's surface, several computer alarms were triggered. According to software engineer Robert Wills, Buzz Aldrin entered the codes to request that the computer display altitude and other data on the computer's screen. The system was designed to support seven simultaneous programs running, but Aldrin's request was the eighth. This action was something he requested many times while working in the simulator. The result was a series of unexpected error codes during the live descent. The on-board flight software captured these alarms with the \"never supposed to happen displays\" interrupting the astronauts with priority alarm displays.[30]\nHamilton had prepared for just this situation years before:\n\nThere was one other failsafe that Hamilton likes to remember. Her \"priority display\" innovation had created a knock-on risk that astronaut and computer would slip out of sync just when it mattered most. As the alarms went off and priority displays replaced normal ones, the actual switchover to new programmes behind the screens was happening \"a step slower\" than it would today.\n\nHamilton had thought long and hard about this. It meant that if Aldrin, say, hit a button on the priority display too quickly, he might still get a \"normal\" response. Her solution: when you see a priority display, first count to\nfive.[31]\n\nBecause of the flight software's system-software's error detection and recovery techniques that included its system-wide \"kill and recompute\" from a \"safe place\" restart approach to its snapshot and rollback techniques, the Display Interface Routines (AKA the priority displays) together with its man-in-the-loop capabilities were able to be created in order to have the capability to interrupt the astronauts' normal mission displays with priority displays of critical alarms in case of an emergency. This depended on our assigning a unique priority to every process in the software in order to ensure that all of its events would take place in the correct order and at the right time relative to everything else that was going on.[39]\n\nHamilton's priority alarm displays interrupted the astronauts' normal displays to warn them that there was an emergency \"giving the astronauts a go/no-go decision (to land or not to land)\".[40] Jack Garman, a NASA computer engineer in mission control, recognized the meaning of the errors that were presented to the astronauts by the priority displays and shouted, \"Go, go!\" and they continued.[41] Paul Curto, a senior technologist who nominated Hamilton for a NASA Space Act Award, called Hamilton's work \"the foundation for ultra-reliable software design\".[28]\n\nHamilton later wrote of the incident:\n\nThe computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough to recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks than it should be performing. It then sent out an alarm, which meant to the astronaut, 'I'm overloaded with more tasks than I should be doing at this time and I'm going to keep only the more important tasks'; i.e., the ones needed for landing ... Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software. The software's action, in this case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones ... If the computer hadn't recognized this problem and taken recovery action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful Moon landing it was.\n\n— Letter from Margaret H. Hamilton, Director of Apollo Flight Computer Programming MIT Draper Laboratory, Cambridge, Massachusetts, titled \"Computer Got Loaded\", published in Datamation, March 1, 1971[42]\n\nIn 1976, Hamilton co-founded with Saydean Zeldin a company called Higher Order Software (HOS)[43] to further develop ideas about error prevention and fault tolerance emerging from their experience at MIT working on the Apollo program.[44][45] They created a product called USE.IT, based on the HOS methodology they developed at MIT.[46][47][48] It was successfully used in numerous government programs[49][50] including a project to formalize and implement C-IDEF, an automated version of IDEF, a modeling language developed by the U.S. Air Force in the Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing (ICAM) project.[51] In 1980, British-Israeli computer scientist David Harel published a proposal for a structured programming language derived from HOS from the viewpoint of and/or subgoals.[52] Others have used HOS to formalize the semantics of linguistic quantifiers,[53] and to formalize the design of reliable real-time embedded systems.[54]\n\nHamilton was the CEO of HOS through 1984[44] and left the company in 1985. In March 1986, she founded Hamilton Technologies, Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company was developed around the Universal Systems Language (USL) and its associated automated environment, the 001 Tool Suite, based on her paradigm of development before the fact for systems design and software development.[35][55][56]\n\nHamilton has been credited with naming the discipline of \"software engineering\".[1][57][58][59] Hamilton details how she came to make up the term \"software engineering\":\n\nWhen I first came up with the term, no one had heard of it before, at least in our world. It was an ongoing joke for a long time. They liked to kid me about my radical ideas. It was a memorable day when one of the most respected hardware gurus explained to everyone in a meeting that he agreed with me that the process of building software should also be considered an engineering discipline, just like with hardware. Not because of his acceptance of the new 'term' per se, but because we had earned his and the acceptance of the others in the room as being in an engineering field in its own right.[39]\n\nWhen Hamilton started using the term \"software engineering\" during the early Apollo missions,[60] software development was not taken seriously compared to other engineering disciplines,[61] nor was it regarded as a science. Hamilton was concerned with legitimizing software development as an engineering discipline.[62] Over time the term \"software engineering\" gained the same respect as any other technical discipline.[57][63] The IEEE Software September/October 2018 issue celebrates the 50th anniversary of software engineering.[64] Hamilton talks about \"Errors\" and how they influenced her work related to software engineering and how her language, USL, could be used to prevent the majority of \"Errors\" in a system.[65] With USL, rather than continuing to test for errors, her program was designed to keep most errors out of the system from the beginning.[66] USL was created after her knowledge and experience from the Apollo mission, in which she determined a mathematical theory for systems and software.[67] This method was then, and still is, highly impactful to the field of software engineering. Writing in Wired, Robert McMillan noted: \"At MIT she assisted in the creation of the core principles in computer programming as she worked with her colleagues in writing code for the world's first portable computer\".[68] Hamilton's innovations go beyond the feats of playing an important role in getting humans to the Moon. According to Wired's Karen Tegan Padir: \"She, along with that other early programming pioneer, COBOL inventor Grace Hopper, also deserve tremendous credit for helping to open the door for more women to enter and succeed in STEM fields like software.\"[69][70]\n\nIn 2017, a \"Women of NASA\" LEGO set went on sale featuring minifigures of Hamilton, astronauts Mae Jemison and Sally Ride, and NASA's first Chief of Astronomy, Nancy Grace Roman. The set was initially proposed by Maia Weinstock as a tribute to the women's contributions to NASA history, and Hamilton's section of the set features a recreation of her famous 1969 photo posing with a stack of her software listings.[71][72]\n\nIn 2019, to celebrate 50 years after the Apollo landing, Google decided to make a tribute to Hamilton. The mirrors at the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility were configured to create a picture of Hamilton and the Apollo 11 by moonlight.[73]\n\nMargo Madison, a fictional NASA engineer in the alternate history series For All Mankind, was inspired by Hamilton.[74]\n\nHamilton has a sister, Kathryn Heafield.[86]\n\nShe met her first husband, James Cox Hamilton,[87] in the mid-1950s while attending college. They were married on June 15, 1958, the summer after she graduated from Earlham.[88][87] She briefly taught high school mathematics and French at a public school in Boston, Indiana.[88][16] The couple then moved to Boston, Massachusetts,[16] where they had a daughter, Lauren, born on November 10, 1959.[6] They divorced in 1967 and Margaret married Dan Lickly two years later.[87][89]",

    "fullText": "The Texas City disaster was an industrial accident that occurred on April 16, 1947, in the port of Texas City, Texas, United States, located in Galveston Bay. It was the deadliest industrial accident in U.S. history and one of history's largest non-nuclear explosions.\n\nThe explosion was triggered by a mid-morning fire on board the French-registered vessel SS Grandcamp (docked at port), which detonated her cargo of about 2,300 tons (about 2,100 metric tons) of ammonium nitrate.[1] This started a chain reaction of fires and explosions aboard other ships and in nearby oil-storage facilities, ultimately killing at least 581 people, including all but one member of Texas City's volunteer fire department.[2]: 100\n\nThe disaster drew the first class action lawsuit against the United States government, on behalf of 8,485 plaintiffs, under the 1946 Federal Tort Claims Act.\n\nThe Port of Texas City is located in a protected harbor inland from Galveston, with relatively straight access to the Gulf of Mexico.[2]: 6  The port expanded greatly during World War II, as many wartime chemical and oil plants were located in or near the city. In 1946, some 4,000 ships loaded or unloaded cargo in the port.[2]: 9  The growth of the town caused a housing shortage, and housing for Black and Hispanic residents was located close to the port.[2]: 10  The nearest neighborhood was only .5 miles (0.80 km) away from the site of the explosion.[2]: 11  Within 1 mile (1.6 km) there were six major chemical or oil companies, nine piers, eleven warehouses, a grain elevator, and many homes.[2]: 12\n\nWhile oil and chemicals had been the major export, the port also began shipping ammonium nitrate in 1945.[2]: 15  The ammonium nitrate, needed either as fertilizer or an explosive, was manufactured in Nebraska and Iowa and shipped to Texas City by rail before being loaded onto ships.[3] The dedicated Texas City Terminal Railway provided final mile service directly to the port.[2]: 11  Export of ammonium nitrate increased significantly in the postwar years as ammunition manufacturing was converted into fertilizer manufacturing, to be sent for export to rebuild war-torn Europe.[2]: 20\n\nSS Grandcamp was a recently re-activated 437-foot-long (133 m) Liberty ship. Originally named SS Benjamin R. Curtis in Los Angeles in 1942, the ship served in the Pacific theater and was mothballed in Philadelphia after the war.[4] In a Cold War gesture, the ship was assigned by the U.S. to the French Line to assist in the rebuilding of France, along with other efforts in Europe. Accordingly, she was captained by a French crew led by Captain Charles de Guillebon. Along with the ammonium nitrate—a very common cargo on the high seas—she was carrying small-arms ammunition, machinery, and bales of sisal twine on the deck.[2]: 19  Her engine was undergoing repairs while docked and thus the ship was inoperable.[2]: 32\n\nAnother ship in the harbor, SS High Flyer, was docked about 600 feet (200 m) away from Grandcamp. The ammonium nitrate aboard the two ships, and fertilizer in an adjacent warehouse, were intended for export to farmers in Europe. Grandcamp had arrived from Houston, where the port authority did not permit the loading of ammonium nitrate.\n\nGrandcamp had a mixed cargo, containing chiefly ammonium nitrate, but also twine, peanuts, tobacco, some small arms ammunition, engineering equipment, and cotton.[2]: 1  The ammonium nitrate was manufactured in a patented process, mixed with clay, petrolatum, rosin and paraffin wax to avoid moisture caking. It was packaged in 100 pounds (45 kg) paper sacks.[2]: 20  Longshoremen reported the bags were warm to the touch before loading.\n\nHigh Flyer held an additional 961 short tons (872 t) of ammonium nitrate[1] and 1,800 short tons (1,600 metric tons) of sulfur.[citation needed]\n\nGrandcamp arrived in port on April 11, 1947, and began loading 2,500 short tons (2,300 t) of fertilizer on April 14, which were to be sent to France.[2]: 19  The storage deck of Grandcamp was divided into five storage holds, with a fuel oil bunker located between Hold 3 and Hold 4. The fertilizer was to be added to Hold 2 and Hold 4. The loading continued until interrupted by rain on the evening of the 15th. Loading was set to continue on the morning of the 16th, with the last 600 short tons (540 t) set to be loaded into the partially full Hold 4.[2]: 19, 35\n\nOn Wednesday, April 16, 1947, around 8 a.m., smoke was spotted in the cargo hold of Grandcamp while it was still moored. Longshoremen used a gallon jug of water and two fire extinguishers, but they had no effect and the cargo hold filled with smoke. The longshoremen were then ordered to leave the hold. At this point, the captain of Grandcamp ordered that no water be used, lest the cargo be ruined. Instead, he ordered all hatches sealed and the hold to be filled with steam in an attempt to smother the fire.[2]: 2  This was unlikely to be effective, as ammonium nitrate is an oxidizer, thus neutralizing the extinguishing properties of steam. The steam may have contributed to the fire by converting the ammonium nitrate to nitrous oxide, while augmenting the already intense heat in the ship's hold.[5] Around 8:30 a.m. the stevedores who were fighting the fire were ordered off the ship, likely because the heat had become too intense and there were concerns that the small arms ammunition could cook off.[2]: 31\n\nWhile the port had fire hydrants, it lacked its own fire engines. A call for outside help was sent at 8:37.[2]: 31  Responding fire departments included the Texas City volunteer fire department and the Republic Oil Refining Company firefighting team.[2]: 2  As crews fought the fire, the hatch on Hold 4 blew off from the pressure of the steam. A column of yellow-orange smoke billowed out, the typical color for nitrogen dioxide fumes.[1] The fire and its unusual-looking smoke attracted a crowd of about 500 spectators (including many children) along the shoreline, who believed they were at a safe distance.[6] Around 9:00, the fire abated slightly, but the steam suppression system was still actively heating Hold 4. Most of the crew had disembarked the ship, and Captain Guillebon was taking a headcount on the pier.[2]: 34\n\nAt 9:12 a.m., the ammonium nitrate reached an explosive threshold and the Grandcamp detonated. The exact cause is unknown, but the likeliest explanation is that the heat of the fire caused the fuel oil bunker adjacent to Hold 4 to split, pouring fuel onto the hot, decomposing fertilizer, creating an impromptu ANFO mixture that was susceptible to detonation.[2]: 35  The Grandcamp was entirely obliterated. The resulting explosion caused utter destruction within 2,000 feet (610 m) and extreme damage throughout the port. The tremendous blast produced a 15 ft (4.6 m) tsunami and a shockwave, levelling nearly 1,000 buildings on land.[2]: 3  The tsunami was responsible for a significant portion of onlooker deaths.[2]: 37\n\nFlying shrapnel resulted in ignition of refineries and chemical tanks along the waterfront. Falling bales of burning twine from Grandcamp's cargo added to the damage, and her anchor was hurled across the city. Two sightseeing airplanes flying nearby were blown out of the sky,[7] while 8 miles (13 km) away, half of the windows in Galveston were shattered.[8] The explosion blew almost 6,350 short tons (5,760 t) of the ship's steel into the air, some at supersonic speed.\n\nThe Monsanto Chemical Company plant adjacent to the slip where Grandcamp was docked suffered the brunt of the first explosion. Of its 574 employees and contractors, 234 were killed, and 200 more were injured. Every man of the Monsanto fire fighting team, which were laying hose reels opposite the Grandcamp, was killed.[2]: 37–38\n\nThe exact damage caused by the first explosion is not fully ascertainable, as the second explosion wreaked further havoc and came before a survey of the damage could be done.[2]: 38\n\nSeven ruptured oil tanks at the Republic Refinery began to burn, letting off thick clouds of black smoke.[2]: 39  Burning sulfur in a dockside warehouse created acrid fumes.[2]: 40\n\nOfficial casualty estimates came to a total of 567, including all the crewmen who remained aboard Grandcamp. All but one member of the 28-man Texas City volunteer fire department were killed in the initial explosion on the docks while fighting the shipboard fire. With fires raging throughout Texas City, first responders from other areas were initially unable to reach the site of the disaster.\n\nStill, 112 people within 500 ft (150 m) of the Grandcamp survived, including many witnesses who would allow for later reconstruction of the events.[2]: 37–38\n\nThe first explosion had set Highflyer free from its moorings, and it had drifted across the harbor, coming to rest against SS Wilson B. Keene. Her crew stayed aboard for an hour before the smoke of the burning oil and sulfur forced them to leave. In the afternoon, two men boarded Highflyer searching for injured crewmembers. They noted that her cargo was ablaze and reported it to someone on the harborfront. This message seems to have gone unheeded for several hours until it was realized that this indicated a serious problem. Only around 11 p.m. did tugboats attempt to pull Highflyer away from the docks. Despite having cut her anchor, they were unable to move her. They fled the area around 1 a.m. the next day (April 17). Ten minutes later, at 1:10 a.m., Highflyer exploded, killing two more people. According to witnesses, the explosion was more powerful than that of Grandcamp. Casualties were light since the docks had already been evacuated, but the second explosion exacerbated the damage to nearby ships and buildings. The blast destroyed the nearby Wilson B. Keene. The steel frame of Highflyer had been heated until glowing, and these chunks rained down upon Texas City setting mass fires.[2]: 4–5, 40–41  One of the propellers was blown off and subsequently found nearly a mile inland. It is now in a memorial park near the anchor of Grandcamp.\n\nThe Texas City disaster is generally considered the worst industrial accident in U.S. history. Witnesses compared the scene to the fairly recent images of the 1943 air raid on Bari and the much larger devastation after an atomic bomb was dropped at Nagasaki.\n\nOf the dead, 405 were identified and 63 have never been identified. The latter remains were placed in a memorial cemetery in the north part of Texas City near Moses Lake. An additional 113 people were classified as missing, for no identifiable parts were ever found. This figure includes firefighters who were aboard Grandcamp when she exploded. There is some speculation that there were hundreds more killed but uncounted, including visiting seamen, undocumented laborers and their families, and an untold number of travelers. More than 800 people were left orphaned or widowed.[2]: 6  However, there were also some survivors among people as close as 70 feet (21 m) from the dock. The victims' bodies quickly filled the local morgue. Several bodies were laid out in the local high school's gymnasium for identification by family or friends.\n\nMore than 5,000 people were injured, with 1,784 admitted to 21 area hospitals. More than 500 homes were destroyed and hundreds damaged, leaving 2,000 homeless. The seaport was destroyed, and many businesses were flattened or burned. Over 1,100 vehicles were damaged and 362 freight cars were obliterated; the property damage was estimated at $100 million[3] (equivalent to $1,100,000,000 in 2024). This number may not encompass the full scope of damage: a further $500 million of oil products burned (equivalent to $5,499,000,000 in 2024).\n\nA 2-short-ton (1.8-metric-ton) anchor of Grandcamp was hurled 1.62 miles (2.61 km) and found in a 10-foot (3 m) crater. It was installed at a memorial park. The other main 5-short-ton (4.5-metric-ton) anchor was hurled 1⁄2 mile (800 m) to the entrance of the Texas City Dike. It rests on a \"Texas-shaped\" memorial at the entrance. Burning wreckage ignited everything within miles, including dozens of oil and chemical tanks. The nearby city of Galveston was covered with an oily fog that left deposits over every exposed outdoor surface.\n\nSome of the deaths and damage in Texas City were due to the destruction and subsequent burning of several chemical plants (including Monsanto and Union Carbide), oil storage, and other facilities near the explosions. Twenty-seven of the twenty-eight members of Texas City's volunteer fire department and three of four members of the Texas City Heights Volunteer Fire Department who were on the docks near the burning ship were killed. One firefighter, Fred Dowdy, who had not responded to the initial call, coordinated other firefighters arriving from communities up to 60 miles (100 km) away. Alvin Fussell, sole survivor of the Heights Volunteer firefighters, was driving to work in Alvin when he heard of the fire on the radio. Eventually 200 firefighters arrived from as far away as Los Angeles. Fires resulting from the cataclysmic events were still burning a week after the disaster, and the process of body recovery took nearly a month. All four fire engines of Texas City were twisted and burned husks.\n\nThe cause of the initial fire on board Grandcamp was never determined. It may have been started by a cigarette discarded the previous day, meaning the ship's cargo had been smoldering throughout the night when the fire was discovered on the morning of the explosion.[1] Historian Hugh Stephens later identified human error as the cause, and cites numerous reasons as to why a minor fire became such a severe incident.[2]: 6\n\nStephens identifies as root causes the expansion of the port, the proximity of dangerous port operations to the rest of Texas City, a lack of community awareness of the danger posed by chemical hazards, and a lack of safety preparation.\n\nSmoking was commonplace at the time. While officially prohibited at the port, such prohibitions were not enforced and smoking was widespread.[2]: 28–29\n\nStephens notes that in interviews and written accounts, few residents of Texas City seemed to understand the danger of the port, as exemplified by the large crowd that assembled to watch the Grandcamp burn. Stephens suggests that in an era before disasters like Bhopal (1984), or Superfund legislation (1986), the sense of danger from chemicals was amorphous. \"Before the accident, Texas City's citizens felt secure because such a disaster had never happened and they could therefore assume it never would.\"[2]: 13  Stephens also points out that Texas City was a boomtown in a time when the rest of the country was still recovering from the Great Depression, in which most of the city owed its prosperity to the oil and chemical industry, which may have further led to lax attitudes.[2]: 14\n\nThe danger of ammonium nitrate may not have been well known at the time. While Army manuals classified it as a high explosive, general belief (and even guidance from the Department of Agriculture) held that fertilizer was not dangerous under typical conditions.[2]: 21–22  However, the danger was not unknown. The Port of Houston had forbidden the loading of fertilizer in 1946.[2]: 24\n\nIn the months before the disaster, local Catholic priest William F. Roach remarked on the concerning industrial conditions by stating \"I feel like I’m sitting on a keg of dynamite.\"[9]\n\nNeither the Port of Texas City, the Texas City Terminal Railway, the City itself, nor any of the oil refineries, had a disaster preparedness plan—which even at the time was regarded as inadequate.[2]: 13–14  The Port itself had no Port authority that could regulate both land and sea operations. Thus, safety was fragmented between companies and between land and sea. The end of military supervision at the end of the war also played a role. Safety authority should have transferred from the military back to the United States Coast Guard, but the Coast Guard failed to take preventative actions and safety instead returned to the hands of private parties.[2]: 16–17  Texas City also failed to police or regulate the dock; such matters were left to security hired by the Terminal Railway.[2]: 27\n\nThe disaster received national media attention, with offers of assistance coming from around the country. Several funds were established to handle donations, particularly the Texas City Relief Fund, created by the city's mayor Curtis Trahan.[2]: 104–105  One of the largest fundraising efforts for the city and the victims of the disaster was organized by Sam Maceo, one of the two brothers who ran organized crime in Galveston at the time. Maceo organized a large-scale benefit on the island, featuring entertainers including Phil Harris, Frank Sinatra, and Ann Sheridan.[2]: 104–105 [10] In the end, the Texas City Relief Fund raised more than $1 million ($15 million in today's terms). Payouts for fire insurance claims reached nearly $4 million ($55.7 million in today's terms).[2]: 104–105\n\nWithin days of the disaster, major companies that had lost facilities in the explosions announced plans to rebuild in Texas City and in some cases to expand their operations. Some companies implemented policies of retaining all of the hourly workers who had previously worked at destroyed facilities with plans to use them in the rebuilding. Cost estimates of the industrial reconstruction were estimated at approximately $100 million ($1.41 billion adjusted for inflation).[2]: 104–105\n\n\"Commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the explosion [...], just as the Phoenix bird symbolizes resurrection from the ashes of despair, the 'Phoenix Fountain' epitomizes courage and the triumph of the human spirit. [...] Chewelah, Washington Artist David Govedare was commissioned by Mayor Charles T. Doyle [...] [to] produce this twelve foot sculpture from half inch cor-ten steel. Architect Joseph Allen Hoover and City Engineer James McWhorter designed the fountain built by Texas City's Public Works Department.\"[11]\n\nMany of the legal cases seeking compensation were combined into Elizabeth Dalehite, et al. v. United States, under the recently enacted Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). On April 13, 1950, the district court found the United States government responsible for a litany of negligent acts of omission and commission by 168 named agencies and their representatives, in the manufacture, packaging, and labeling of ammonium nitrate. This was further compounded by errors in transport, storage, loading, fire prevention, and fire suppression, all of which led to the explosions and the subsequent carnage.\n\nOn June 10, 1952, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned this decision, finding that the United States maintained the right to exercise its own \"discretion\" in vital national matters. The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed that decision (346 U.S. 15, June 8, 1953), in a 4-to-3 opinion, noting that the district court had no jurisdiction under the federal statute to find the government liable for \"negligent planning decisions\" which were properly delegated to various departments and agencies. In short, the FTCA clearly exempts \"failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty\", and the court found that all of the alleged acts in this case were discretionary in nature.[12]\n\nIn its dissent, the three justices argued that, under the FTCA, \"Congress has defined the tort liability of the government as analogous to that of a private person\", i.e., when carrying out duties unrelated to governing. In this case, \"a policy adopted in the exercise of an immune discretion was carried out carelessly by those in charge of detail\", and that a private person would certainly be held liable for such acts. A private person is held to a higher standard of care when carrying out \"inherently dangerous\" acts such as transportation and storage of explosives.\n\nAccording to Melvin Belli in his book Ready for the Plaintiff! (1965), Congress acted to provide some compensation after the courts refused to do so.[13] The Dalehite decision was eventually \"appealed\" to Congress, where relief was granted by means of legislation (Public Law 378, 69 Stat. 707 (1955)).[14] When the last claim had been processed in 1957, 1,394 awards totaling nearly $17 million had been made.",

    "fullText": "A private jet crashed at a regional North Carolina airport and erupted into flames Thursday, killing seven people, including retired NASCAR star Greg Biffle and three members of his family, officials said.\n\nHere are some things to know about the crash.\n\nThe plane took off Thursday morning from Statesville Regional Airport, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of Charlotte. Shortly after takeoff, the jet turned back toward the airport and crashed while attempting to land, according to tracking data posted by FlightAware.com.\n\nVideo from WSOC-TV showed first responders rushing onto the runway, where flames burned near scattered wreckage.\n\nInvestigators have said it is too early to determine what caused the crash. There was some drizzle and clouds at the time, according to AccuWeather.\n\nStatesville Regional Airport offers corporate aviation facilities for Fortune 500 companies and several NASCAR teams, according to its website.\n\nAccording to a joint statement released by the victims' families, there were seven people aboard the plane, including Greg Biffle; his wife, Cristina Grossu Biffle; their son, Ryder; and Greg Biffle's daughter, Emma.\n\nThe statement identified the other victims as Craig Wadsworth, Dennis Dutton and Dutton's son, Jack, all “beloved by many in the NASCAR community.”\n\n“Each of them meant everything to us, and their absence leaves an immeasurable void in our lives,” the statement said.\n\nBiffle, 55, won more than 50 races across NASCAR’s three circuits, including 19 at the Cup Series level. He also won championships in both the lower-tier national Truck and Xfinity Series — the first driver to do so — and spent almost his entire career driving for Roush Fenway Racing, headquartered about 40 miles south of the crash site.\n\nWadsworth, a longtime behind-the-scenes employee with several NASCAR teams, was friends with Biffle and had helped him with odd jobs, including delivering supplies to places hit by Hurricane Helene a year ago, according to Wadsworth's roommate, Benito Howell.\n\nBiffle joins a somber roll of athletes who died in plane or helicopter crashes.\n\nThe plane was a Cessna C550, a popular mid-sized business jet with an excellent reputation, aviation safety expert Jeff Guzzetti said. Flight records show the plane was registered to a company run by Greg Biffle.\n\nThe plane was scheduled to fly to Sarasota, Florida, and then to Treasure Cay airport in the Bahamas before returning.\n\nBiffle's plane was built in 1981 and would have likely cost between $1 million and $10 million, depending on how it was outfitted, Guzzetti said. The Cessna 550 Citation has two engines and typically seats six to eight passengers.",

    "title": "Most millionaires don't consider themselves wealthy. So what does it really mean to be rich?",
    "description": "New data shows that having at least $1 million doesn’t necessarily mean you’re rich. Here’s what it really takes to feel financially secure today.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nJust one third (36%) of the nation’s wealthiest citizens — those with at least $1 million in investable assets — consider themselves wealthy, according to Northwestern Mutual’s 2025 Planning and Progress study.\n\nFurther, nearly half (49%) of American millionaires say their financial planning needs improvement, citing the possibility of outliving their savings, the impact of taxes in retirement, and potential long-term care needs as their top financial concerns.\n\nThis gap may be surprising, but it highlights how rising costs, longer lifespans, and shifting expectations have redefined what it means to feel rich in modern America.\n\nOne reason most millionaires don’t consider themselves wealthy is because our definition of wealth has changed over time.\n\n“Being a millionaire used to mean you had done really well and ‘made it,’” said Tom Mathews, CFEd, CPA, and author of \"How Money Works.\" “Today, it really just means you’ve crossed an outdated line.”\n\nMathews explained the problem isn’t necessarily that people have less money today, but rather, they have less certainty and control around their finances. “Things like inflation, rising taxes, market volatility, and the escalating cost of housing, healthcare, and education have changed what financial security feels like,” he said. “A million dollars on paper doesn’t stretch the way it used to, especially when most of that net worth is tied up in illiquid assets like homes, retirement accounts, or businesses.”\n\nThere’s also the issue of longevity. With people living longer, a seven-figure portfolio may not seem substantial when it’s expected to fund decades of living expenses and rising medical costs.\n\nIn other words, Mathews said, many people might look wealthy on paper, but that doesn’t mean they feel financially secure.\n\nIf millionaires don’t necessarily feel wealthy, what does it take to feel rich in today’s economy?\n\nAccording to Charles Schwab’s 2025 Modern Wealth Survey, Americans need an average net worth of $839,000 to be financially comfortable, and $2.3 million to feel wealthy.\n\nAdditionally, 63% of survey respondents said it feels like it takes more money to be wealthy today when compared with last year, citing the impact of inflation (73%), a worsened economy (62%), and higher taxes (48%) as the top reasons.\n\nBut experts say feeling wealthy isn’t just about how much money you have. The key is achieving true financial security.\n\n“The real takeaway is that wealth is no longer about accumulation. It’s about confidence,” Mathews said. “Confidence comes from education, strategy, and structure.” He added that when people understand how money works, they stop guessing or reacting to headlines and start making more informed decisions. “That’s when wealth finally feels like wealth,” he said.\n\nReaching true financial security is a personal journey; everyone has their own idea of what that looks like. However, there are financial moves you can make to improve your financial situation and feel more secure.\n\nCreate a clear financial plan: The Northwestern Mutual Study found that millionaires are much more likely to report higher levels of financial discipline, confidence, and clarity than the average American. Having a clear understanding of your budget, financial goals, and long-term wealth-building strategy can make you feel more confident in your future.\n\nPrioritize paying off debt and saving more: Your net worth is a key indicator of your financial health. And the formula for improving your net worth is fairly simple: Increase what you own (assets) and decrease what you owe (debts). That’s why it’s smart to prioritize paying down debt and increasing your savings to build a higher net worth over time.\n\nSeek help from a professional: There’s no shame in asking for help. In fact, according to the survey, millionaires are more than twice as likely to work with a financial advisor than the general public (74% vs. 34%, respectively). Consulting a professional can help you better understand your finances and create a plan with your specific goals in mind.\n\nLearn the difference between cash and cash equivalents, plus examples and when these low-risk options make sense for savers.\n\nYour personal cash burn rate shows how fast you spend money each month. Learn how to calculate it and use it to protect your savings.\n\nThese AI tools for freelancers can help you run a more efficient business. Because as a freelancer, more free time can mean more money in your bank account.\n\nThe Beige Book, a report published by the Federal Reserve, gathers real-world business insights and helps guide future Fed policy decisions.\n\nHow many millionaires are there in America, and how can you join their ranks? Here’s a closer look at millionaires in the U.S. and their financial habits.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is easing some federal restrictions on marijuana.\n\nTrump signed an executive order on Thursday that will reclassify marijuana to a Schedule III drug, putting it on par with drugs like ketamine and anabolic steroids.\n\n\"We have people begging for me to do this, people that are in great pain,\" Trump said during an event in the Oval Office, flanked by several doctors.\n\nThe order falls short of fully legalizing marijuana, but it will make it easier for researchers to study the drug.\n\nTrump said that he had been lobbied to make the change by people with extreme pain, incurable diseases, and seizure disorders, among others. The president noted the substance's medical uses, including as a \"substitute for addictive and potentially lethal opioid painkillers.\"\n\nThe move could also bring tax relief to marijuana businesses operating in states that have already legalized the substance.\n\nMarijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug, a category for substances with \"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse,\" according to the Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\nSchedule III drugs, on the other hand, have a \"moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.\"\n\nMarijuana stocks surged last week amid widespread rumors of Trump's impending order. Most of the sector's most prominent names continued trending upward with this week on mounting speculation for the pro-cannabis policy decision.\n\nNews of Trump signing the executive order continued to boost the industry's biggest players. Tilray Brands, typically seen as a leader among cannabis stocks, jumped 6% today while Aurora Cannabis rose 9% and Canopy Growth Corporation spiked 11%.\n\nThese cannabis stocks are all relatively small cap and are prone to price swings, but the signing of an executive order is a highly bullish catalyst for the industry.\n\nAs he campaigned for a third time in 2024, Trump signaled that he would take a friendlier approach toward marijuana than he did during his first term.\n\n\"I promised to be the president of common sense, and that is exactly what we're doing,\" Trump said on Thursday.\n\nHe said that he would vote for a ballot measure in Florida aimed at legalizing marijuana for recreational use in the state. That measure garnered 56% of the vote but ultimately fell short of the 60% required for passage.\n\nTrump also said in 2024 that he supported enacting laws to make it easier for marijuana businesses to operate.",

    "fullText": "The nation's largest HR trade group has been sued by a woman who alleges it revoked a job offer because it didn't want her medical service dog in the office.\n\nThe lawsuit filed Tuesday by Fiona Torres against the Society for Human Resource Management says she is diabetic, and the dog can detect changes in her blood-sugar levels faster and more reliably than a top-tier glucose monitor.\n\nSHRM says it \"fully complied\" with the Americans with Disabilities Act in offering Torres an alternative \"reasonable accommodation\" for her health condition.\n\nTorres' lawsuit was filed less than two weeks after SHRM was ordered to pay $11.5 million in an unrelated race discrimination and retaliation case.\n\nThe new complaint alleges that in June 2024, SHRM offered Torres a role as a senior specialist in its product management department at its office in Alexandria, Virginia, then revoked the offer in July because she wanted to bring her dog to work.\n\nTorres said SHRM's offer to accommodate her medical needs was to allow her to keep food, water, and an insulin pump at her desk, which she felt was insufficient.\n\n\"I was ready and able to work,\" Torres said in an email to Business Insider through her attorney. \"They said they were eager to have me until they found out I had a disability and a service dog.\"\n\nThe complaint quotes an email from SHRM to Torres denying her accommodation request.\n\n\"[I]t does not appear there are any reasonable accommodations that would allow you to perform the essential functions of the role,\" SHRM wrote, according to the complaint.\n\nSHRM spokesman Eddie Burke declined to comment on the specifics of the suit, saying the organization was still reviewing the legal papers.\n\n\"We support the ADA and are actively committed to supporting employees through fair, respectful, and legally compliant accommodation processes,\" he said. \"We fully complied with the ADA in this matter and, in consultation with outside legal counsel, met all of our obligations to provide reasonable accommodations to Fiona Torres.\"\n\nLori Kisch, a lawyer for Torres, told Business Insider that SHRM's alleged conduct was \"ironic\" given that it provides information and resources to help HR professionals follow laws such as the ADA.\n\n\"They can't argue that they don't understand the law, and their actions are a reckless indifference to the law,\" she said.\n\nTorres' case, filed in federal court in Virginia, follows a lawsuit brought by a former SHRM employee that alleged race discrimination and retaliation. Rehab Mohamed, a Black and Egyptian instructional designer, claimed her SHRM manager held her to higher standards than white employees. A jury found SHRM liable for $11.5 million in damages.\n\nSHRM has said it plans to file an appeal and that the verdict \"does not reflect the facts, the law, or the truth of how\" it operates.",

Winterfest is here, and that means lots of free stuff. As has become tradition in Fortnite, Epic Games has brought back the Winterfest Cabin, which is full of free cosmetics waiting to be opened.\n\nThere are 14 free gifts available in the cabin, and you can open one each day. In past years, these gifts would stack--if you missed a day, you'd be able to open two the following day. But it doesn't work that way this year. This time, you really can only open one present each day, no matter what. So be sure to keep up with them, or else you might miss out on some of the gifts.\n\nAs you can see from the graphic, this year's collection of gifts includes two free skins, two back blings, two pickaxes, two musical instruments, a glider, a weapon wrap, a Fortnite-original jam track based on Carol of the Bells, a contrail, and a few sprays and emoticons for good measure.\n\nThe skins are in the two large presents in the back on the left side of the room, but you won't be able to open them at the start. You can unlock the Glacial Dummy skin after opening seven other presents, which means he'll be available on Christmas day, And you can get Cheeks, the hamster man, only after you've picked every other present, which means he'll unlock on New Year's Eve.\n\nBeyond those two skins, you can unlock the presents in any order you want. And despite the fact there's a Hogwarts student chilling in the cabin while the Harry Potter movie theme plays, none of the free gifts have anything to do with the Harry Potter franchise.\n\nFor a better look at some of the free rewards, as pulled by fortnite.gg, you can pull from this year's Winterfest Cabin, scroll on.

    "description": "As a frequent flyer, there are things I'd never do in an airport lounge, such as sleeping or stuffing my face at the buffet.",
    "fullText": "I travel often — at least once a month — and I like having access to Delta Sky Clubs through my co-branded Delta credit card and Priority Pass, a membership that gets me into more than 1,500 airport lounges worldwide.\n\nThese two programs usually allow me to find a lounge I can use regardless of the airport I'm at or the airline I'm flying.\n\nI enjoy using airport lounges because they're usually quieter and less crowded than waiting at the gate. I also like having access to a nicer, less-crowded restroom, and of course, the complimentary food and beverages are pretty sweet, too.\n\nAs a frequent traveler, here are five things I never do in an airport lounge.\n\nMost airport lounges have a variety of seating, from desk-like workspaces with electrical outlets to comfortable upholstered couches you might find in a living room.\n\nI don't pick the first open seat I see unless the lounge is super crowded and I feel as if it's my only option. Fortunately, I can usually gauge how crowded a lounge is by the presence of a line at the entry.\n\nA lot of lounges I've visited don't allow new visitors when they're close to capacity, so finding a seat is usually not an issue.\n\nIf I'm not familiar with a lounge's layout, I'll take a lap to see all the available seating. I love a comfortable chair with built-in USB ports so I can charge my phone, so I'll look for that type of seating first.\n\nI also like to sit away from the buffet, bar, and restrooms so I can have as quiet an atmosphere as possible.\n\nFood varies widely from lounge to lounge, from chef-curated menus to bowls of trail mix and grab-and-go snacks, but there are typically plenty of hot food offerings.\n\nThey can be tempting, but I don't have that \"it's free, and it's there\" mentality, so I won't load up my plate unless I'm starving or know I won't be eating for a while. I don't want to feel too full or bloated before a long flight.\n\nThe bar is always a happening spot for travelers, but I take it easy on the alcohol some lounges give out for free.\n\nI might have a drink once in a while, but I don't want to get dehydrated before a long flight or lose my inhibitions to the point where I'm not watching my belongings or the time.\n\nEven if I'm tired and a lounge has comfy, reclining chairs, I don't sleep in airport lounges. I'm always too nervous I'll miss my flight.\n\nI've never had a lengthy layover during which I was that exhausted, plus most lounges have time limits on how long people can be inside them.\n\nGetting off my feet and relaxing is usually enough of a break if I'm tired.\n\nUnless a lounge is virtually empty, I don't take up more than one seat or put my backpack on its own chair. I get frustrated when I'm looking for a seat, but many are unavailable because people are using them as storage.\n\nUsing headphones is also a cardinal rule in airport lounges, although I often see people being inconsiderate by streaming or using FaceTime without them.\n\nI also wouldn't engage in some behaviors I see in lounges that I find gross, such as removing shoes to put bare feet on airport furniture or taking care of personal grooming — like clipping nails — outside a restroom.\n\nLounges provide a comfortable, home-like environment, but I try to remember that they are public spaces. I wish other people would, too.\n\nI love having lounge access, but I won't leave my flight's terminal to seek one out unless my layover is at least two hours long.\n\nEven then, I hesitate to go unless I'm familiar with the airport. I never want to miss a flight just because I wanted some extra comfort before it.\n\nThis story was originally published on July 25, 2024, and most recently updated on December 18, 2025.",

    "fullText": "A Kansas tribe said it has walked away from a nearly $30 million federal contract to come up with preliminary designs for immigrant detention centers after facing a wave of online criticism.\n\nThe Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation 's announcement Wednesday night came just over a week after the economic development leaders who brokered the deal with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement were fired.\n\nWith some Native Americans swept up and detained in recent ICE raids, the deal was derided online as “disgusting” and “cruel.\" Many in Indian Country also questioned how a tribe whose own ancestors were uprooted two centuries ago from the Great Lakes region and corralled on a reservation south of Topeka could participate in the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts.\n\nTribal Chairman Joseph “Zeke” Rupnick nodded to the historic issues last week in a video address that called reservations \"the government’s first attempts at detention centers.” In an update Wednesday, he announced that he was “happy to share that our Nation has successfully exited all third-party related interests affiliated with ICE.”\n\nThe Prairie Band Potawatomi has a range of businesses that provide health care management staffing, general contracting and even interior design. And Rupnick said in his latest address that tribal officials plan to meet in January about how to ensure “economic interests do not come into conflict with our values in the future.”\n\nA tribal offshoot hired by ICE — KPB Services LLC — was established in April in Holton, Kansas, by Ernest C. Woodward Jr., a former naval officer who markets himself as a “go-to” adviser for tribes and affiliated companies seeking to land federal contracts.\n\nThe Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation said in 2017 that Woodward’s firm advised it on its acquisition of another government contractor, Mill Creek LLC, which specializes in outfitting federal buildings and the military with office furniture and medical equipment.\n\nWoodward also is listed as the chief operating officer of the Florida branch of Prairie Band Construction Inc., which was registered in September.\n\nAttempts to locate Woodward were unsuccessful. A spokesperson for KPB said Woodward is no longer with the LLC but she declined to say whether he was terminated. Woodward did not respond to an email sent to another consulting firm he’s affiliated with, Virginia-based Chinkapin Partners LLC.\n\nA spokesperson for the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation said the tribe divested from KPB. While that company still has the contract, “Prairie Band no longer has a stake,” the spokesperson said.\n\nThe spokesperson said Woodward is no longer with the tribe's limited liability corporation, but she declined to say whether he was terminated.\n\nThe ICE contract initially was awarded in October for $19 million for unspecified “due diligence and concept designs” for processing centers and detention centers throughout the U.S., according to a one-sentence description of the work on the federal government’s real-time contracting database. It was modified a month later to increase the payout ceiling to $29.9 million.\n\nSole-source contracts above $30 million require additional justification under federal contracting rules.\n\nTribal leaders and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security haven’t responded to detailed questions about why the firm was selected for such a big contract without having to compete for the work as federal contracting normally requires. It’s also unclear what the Tribal Council knew about the contract.\n\n“That process of internal auditing is really just beginning,” the tribal spokesperson said.\n\nHollingsworth reported from Mission, Kansas, and Goodman from Miami.",

The U.S. support for ‘Taiwan Independence’ through arms will only end up backfiring. Using Taiwan to contain China will not succeed.\"\n\nU.S. officials have not yet detailed delivery timelines, but the sale reflects Washington’s push to accelerate Taiwan’s defenses amid growing concern over China’s military pressure campaign. The HIMARS and ATACMS combination is expected to draw particular attention from Beijing because it would allow Taiwan to target PLA staging areas, ships and infrastructure from mobile launchers, a capability China has repeatedly warned against.\n\nIn its notification to Congress, the State Department said the proposed sales would advance \"U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient’s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.\"\n\nThe department added that the weapons would \"help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance and economic progress in the region.\"\n\nUnder longstanding U.S. policy, Washington provides Taiwan with arms it deems necessary for the island’s self-defense while maintaining a \"One China\" policy and not supporting a declaration of formal independence. China argues that any enhancement of Taiwan’s defenses encourages separatism, while U.S. officials say the purpose of such sales is to preserve stability and deter conflict.\n\nHigh Stakes On The High Seas As Us, China Test Limits Of Military Power\n\nThe package now enters a 30-day congressional review period, during which lawmakers could file a resolution attempting to block it, a step Congress has never taken for an arms sale to Taiwan. Once the review period ends, contracting and production begin, a process that typically stretches over several years and contributes to a backlog that once reached $20 billion in undelivered U.S. weapons Taiwan has already purchased.\n\nChina has a track record of responding to major Taiwan arms sales with military demonstrations, including large-scale PLA drills, increased air and naval activity near the island and sanctions on U.S. defense firms. Analysts say Beijing’s sharp rhetoric suggests additional military signaling is likely, though China did not immediately announce specific countermeasures.\n\nThe latest sale marks a significant boost to Taiwan’s conventional firepower. In recent months, Beijing has stepped up pressure across the strait with near-daily PLA air and naval patrols, record incursions around the island and high-profile exercises meant to signal its ability to encircle Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan’s Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung thanked the U.S. Wednesday for its \"long-term support for regional security and Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities,\" which he said are key to deterring a conflict in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nOriginal article",

    "description": "Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released new photos from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, including some showing him with powerful people.",
    "fullText": "Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released a new batch of photos obtained from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, with some featuring tech titans Bill Gates and Sergey Brin.\n\nThe latest batch comes ahead of the December 19 deadline for the Justice Department to release its own Epstein-related files through the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Thursday's release marks the latest documents the committee has made public from the files it obtained from the Epstein estate through a subpoena earlier this year.\n\nInclusion in the photos isn't an indication of wrongdoing, and some of the pics appear to have been taken at a conference attended by other business professionals.\n\nEpstein — who killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex-trafficking charges, and who in 2008 pleaded guilty to a lesser sexual offense — has long been the subject of conspiracy theories.\n\nHe amassed a fortune worth over $600 million at the time of his death and maintained ties with some of the most powerful people in the world, including President Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Steve Bannon, and the former Prince Andrew.\n\nThe relationship between Gates and Epstein has been known for years.\n\nThey met several times — Gates has said the meetings were about philanthropy — and had ties to some of the same people. Epstein sought to establish a philanthropic organization funded by Gates and housed at JPMorgan Chase, a project that never came to fruition.\n\nEpstein has also named Boris Nikolic, a former advisor to Gates, as a backup executor for his estate.\n\nIn the past, Gates has said that he \"made a mistake in judgment\" when asked about his relationship with the pedophile, calling it \"foolish\" in an interview with the Journal this year.\n\nThe House Oversight's document dump did not say when or where the photos were taken or the identities of the women in the photos.\n\nThe billionaire has appeared in the Oversight Committee's Epstein releases before: In September, an email was released that included Epstein's 2014 schedule, which listed a \"tentative breakfast party w/Bill Gates.\"\n\nEarlier this month, a photo was released of Gates with one of Epstein's pilots.\n\nA representative for Gates did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment about the new photos.\n\nEpstein, who maintained a deep relationship with JPMorgan Chase, referred Google cofounder Sergey Brin to the bank as a client in 2004. He later connected Brin with members of the bank who could advise the tech billionaire on tax issues.\n\nSome of the photos of Brin appear to have been taken at events organized by The Edge, a now-dormant organization that arranged conferences about ideas. Epstein also attended some of these events.\n\nIn the foreground of one of the photos, Brin appears with New York Times columnist David Brooks.\n\nA representative for Brin did not immediately respond to a request for comment to Business Insider about the photographs.\n\nA spokesperson for Brooks said the journalist attended the event in 2011 \"to speak with noted and important business leaders to inform his columns.\"\n\n\"Mr. Brooks had no contact with him before or after this single attendance at a widely-attended dinner,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nSalar Kamangar, an early Google employee and later the CEO of YouTube, was also featured in Thursday's photo drop. He appeared to be photographed at the same 2011 event as Brin and Brooks.\n\nNeither Kamangar nor representatives for Google immediately responded to Business Insider's request for comment about the new photos.",

    "description": "A Kennedy Center Board member accused the White House of lying about the vote to change the center's name to the Trump Kennedy Center.",
    "fullText": "A Kennedy Center board member accused the White House of lying about the organization’s “unanimous” vote to change the center’s name to the “Trump-Kennedy Center,” claiming that her dissent was censored.\n\nOn Thursday, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that the Trump-controlled board “voted unanimously” for the name change. Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), who sits on the center’s board, posted a video to X after the announcement making it clear that she was on the call when the decision was made and was muted so she could not voice her dissenting opinion.\n\n“What you may hear is that there was a unanimous vote to rename the Kennedy Center the Trump Center,” Beatty said. “Be clear, I was on that call and as I tried to push my button to voice my concern, to ask questions, and certainly not to vote in support of this, I was muted. Each time I tried to speak I was muted. Participants were not allowed to voice their concerns who were online yet it was said at the end it was a unanimous vote.”\n\nFor the record. This was not unanimous. I was muted on the call and not allowed to speak or voice my opposition to this  move. Also for the record, this was not on the agenda. This was not consensus. This is censorship. https://t.co/D1zGV7xiWV pic.twitter.com/npNvSIy6sV\n\n— Rep. Joyce Beatty (@RepBeatty) December 18, 2025\n\nShe continued: “Clearly, the Congress has a say in this. This center – the Kennedy Center – was created by the Congress. I think it is important for us to know that this is just another attempt to evade the law, and not let the people have a say.”\n\nThe president named himself a chairman of the Kennedy Center earlier this year after taking office. He hinted at the name change in October in a Truth Social post.\n\nThe proposal to change the name of the center to the Trump-Kennedy Center was also lambasted online by members of President John F. Kennedy’s family on Thursdasy.\n\n“Perhaps the board isn’t aware that the Kennedy Center is the memorial to the president of the United States, John F. Kennedy,” Tim Shriver, JFK’s nephew, wrote on X. “Would they rename the Lincoln Memorial? The Jefferson? That would be an insult to great presidents. This too is an insult to a great president.”\n\nPerhaps the board isn’t aware that the Kennedy Center is 𝗧𝗛𝗘 memorial to the president of the United States, John F. Kennedy.

Kennedy,” Shriver, JFK’s niece, wrote. “It was named in his honor. He was a man who was interested in the arts, interested in culture, interested in education, language, history. He brought the arts into the White House, and he and my Aunt Jackie amplified the arts, celebrated the arts, stood up for the arts and artists.”\n\nThe Kennedy Center was named after my uncle, President John F Kennedy.

It is beyond wild that he would think adding his name in front of President Kennedy’s name is acceptable. It is not.”\n\nJoe Kennedy III added that altering the Kennedy Center could “no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says.”\n\nIn July, House Republican’s introduced a bill that aimed to strip former President Kennedy’s name from the center, turning it into the Trump Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nThe center’s name change was part of legislation introduced by Rep. Bob Onder (R-Missouri) called the Make Entertainment Great Again (MEGA) Act. Onder noted in his bill proposal that Trump was intended “to preserve the integrity of the fine arts by ending woke programming and rebalancing the Kennedy Center’s $234 million budget” since being elected chairman.\n\nThe post Kennedy Center Board Member Says Opposition to Trump Renaming Was Censored as JFK Family Condemns Move: ‘An Insult’ appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "title": "The 12 comfiest sweatsuits for women that feel cozy and put-together",
    "description": "I did the hard work of testing the best and comfiest sweatsuits for women, and these are the winners.",
    "fullText": "If it takes 10,000 hours to become an \"expert\" at something, then I'm easily an expert at wearing sweatsuits. I tomy career fully remote five years ago, I've amassed no less than 22 sweatsuits which comprise my daily uniform. The best matching sweatsuits I've tried look more put together than separates, so I can transition from my home office to running errands and back again without any outfit changes.\n\nMy favorite sweatsuit comes from Spanx (more specifically, the Air Essentials Wide-Leg Pants and Half-Zip Sweatshirt). It's made with a lightweight, luxurious-feeling fabric (though I found the Anrabess Women's 2-Piece Sweatsuit to be a solid alternative at a fraction of the price). I'm also a huge fan of Gap's VintageSoft Boyfriend Joggers and Raglan Sweatshirt. They're warm, cozy, and come in tons of fun colors (which is why I bought three!).\n\nI remember the first time I put on Spanx's AirEssentials sweatsuit and quickly understood the hype (our own editors and Oprah are big fans). The fabric felt luxurious, stretchy and super soft. It remains one of the comfiest things I've ever had on my body.\n\nThough the pants come in petite and long inseams, Spanx recommends the regular length for someone 5-foot-7. So I selected the Wide-Leg Pants in a size Medium, with a Half-Zip sweatshirt in a size Small. Both fit me impeccably.\n\nI wear the whole set with crisp, white sneakers and oversized sunglasses, and the finished look is downright fancy. That's a feeling I usually find difficult to achieve in sweats. Another little bonus is that the fabric offers UPF 50+ protection.\n\n\"What sets this sweater apart is its oversized silhouette, which lends it a more intentional, wearable shape than any other sweatshirt. It drapes beautifully, and the ribbed hem and banded cuffs add just enough structure to keep it from feeling boxy. Though the crewneck sweater that I'm wearing above is sold out, there's still lots of stock in the V-neck version.\n\nGap's CashSoft Boot Sweater Pants are perhaps my favorite piece in the whole CashSoft line. The boot-cut silhouette is the real differentiator here: instead of the straight or jogger shape most sweat pants default to, this cut elongates the leg and balances out bulkier winter tops. It gives the pants a more \"finished\" look, almost like a soft-knit version of trousers. Plus, it helps that these are available in both petite and tall lengths so that you can get the perfect fit.\n\nAs someone who has always switched between leggings, jeans, and sweatpants for cozy weekend days, this pant beats all of them in comfort, warmth, and style. I'm planning to purchase it in both black and white, so I can pair it with almost anything.\" —Samantha Crozier, style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nRead \n\n\"These are the ultimate cold weather sweatpants. They feel so warm and cozy, and the fleece interior is baby soft. Aesthetically inspired by track pants, the Beyond Yoga sweats are sporty chic, with a cute split hem at the bottom is a cute sporty touch and retro contrast piping trim down the side of the legs. While the fit is somewhat relaxed, the pants are form-fitting, with a mid-rise waist and an ever-so-slight flare. I'm not normally a matching-set girlie, but I felt very cool wearing these with the matching LuxeFleece Piper Oversized Sweatshirt.\" — Maria Yagoda, freelance writer, Insider Reviews\n\nOther styles from Beyond Yoga come in a wider size range. Learn \n\nThough the design on this Gap pullover and jogger set is classic, the quality is top-notch. The fabric is cozy and warm, though not overly so. The fit is roomy but not oversized, making it perfect for layering. I love that the top and bottom are sold separately and both come in three lengths.\n\nIf I truly love something in my wardrobe, I'm the type of person who will buy two. Rarely, though, do I buy three of a kind, but I did with this sweatsuit because I reached for it so often. (Actually, it's four if you count the set I gifted my sister for Christmas.) It's easy to load up because there are lots of vibrant and neutral colors to choose from, and Gap is regularly adding new ones to the mix.\n\nThis is Amazon's number one best-seller in women's tracksuits for good reason. The stretchy, silky-soft, medium-weight fabric is much more expensive-looking than I anticipated. I chose a rich, dark brown color called Coffee. When I opened the zippered plastic bag it came in, it was exactly the hue I expected. I also love that the top looks equally stylish with leggings or jeans.\n\nStill, I should note that this is sold as a set, so it's not ideal for people who (like me) size differently in tops and bottoms. Still, if you're looking for a budget-friendly option that looks luxe, it's hard to beat this price.\n\nRead \n\nI'm a long-time fan of Vuori's elevated athleisure, and I regularly pack items from the brand when I'm traveling. Their Restore fleece collection might be my favorite yet. The French terry fabric is nice and warm without feeling too heavy. I appreciate that the hoodie has a half zip, making it easier to pull over my head without messing up my hair and allowing me to adjust the warmth. The bottoms have multiple design details that set them apart from your basic sweatpants: a pintuck down the front, exposed ties and a stitched logo on the back.\n\nI chose the Chia colorway, which is a versatile mauvy-brown. The fit is true to size with a slightly oversized silhouette that is roomy but not baggy. I just wish there were length options for the joggers like there are with the Performance joggers I love so much.\n\nAs far as textiles are concerned, Buck Mason stands above the competition. Home to some of our favorite basic t-shirts, the brand makes equally notable athleisure. The 100% cotton jersey sweats are designed to retain their shape, despite washing or napping in them. They come pre-washed, too, giving them a lived-in feel from the first wear (this time it was at the nail salon, where I immediately got a compliment). The mid-weight fabric is airy yet substantial — a perfect combination for comfort.\n\nI tend to be in-between size, so I went up in these but wished I had sized down instead. The fit is generously oversized. Still, they look more polished than your typical sweats, especially the mockneck top.\n\nAthleta makes my favorite work pants that feel like sweatpants. Recently, I sampled their Seasoft sweats, and (no surprise here) I was thoroughly pleased.\n\nThis lightweight Athleta sweatsuit is great for warmer months thanks to a breathable, machine-washable fabric and breezy silhouette. While it's equally great for lounging or running errands, this would definitely be the sweatsuit I choose for sportier activities, like a long walk outdoors. It's also ideal for travel since the material is wrinkle-resistant. I'm especially enamored with the quarter-zip top, which has stylish ribbed detailing around the zipper. I also love that the bottom hem has a drawcord to adjust the fit.\n\n\"This $220 sweatsuit is the best investment I've made as a working mom. I can do school drop-off without having to get fully dressed,\" writes deputy editor Conz Preti in her review of the pima cotton outfit sold as a two-piece set. \"I got the lavender color set that has an accent of red on the sleeves. The cotton is super soft and light, and the look is relaxed — which I strive to be in the mornings rushing out the door.\n\n\"I can wear the sweatsuit with sneakers or rain boots, and as the days get colder, I can easily throw a jacket on top. Because of the relaxed look, I can wear anything underneath, like a tee or a tank top. I've gotten lots of compliments from other moms at school, and I'm always happy to share my secret.\"\n\nNothing compares to being enveloped in an extra oversized sweatsuit. Lululemon's oversized Scuba set delivers on that front. Still, I don't feel like I'm swimming in it, thanks to the sweatshirt's cropped waist. My favorite details are the sweatshirt's gold zipper and large stitched logo on the hood. They elevate it from a typical sweatshirt, making me more inclined to wear it out when I'm running errands.\n\nI was a little unsure of what size to pick in the top since the sizes are grouped XS/S, M/L and XL/XXL. I'm usually between a small and a medium, so I sized up to M/L, but in retrospect, I would have been happier with the XS/S. I mistakenly sized up in the bottoms, too, but shouldn't have due to the already oversized fit.\n\nOn the coldest days, I reach for a sweatsuit from Athleta's Forever Fleece collection — its warmth is unrivaled. The plush fleece has a soft, brushed interior that has the perfect amount of stretch for comfort. Still, it's adequately breathable.\n\nThe sweatshirt is a generous 28 inches long, which adds warmth and lets it pair well with leggings. Both the half-zip sweatshirt and the high-rise joggers are liberally oversized, which works well if you plan on layering clothes underneath. If I had to do it over, I might have preferred to size down, though.\n\nIf you haven't heard of Popflex, you've certainly heard of one highly notable fan: Taylor Swift. It's been heavily speculated that the \"lilac short skirt\" Swift sings about in \"imgonnagetyouback\" is the Popflex Pirouette Skirt, so we simply had to check out the inclusive activewear brand for ourselves.\n\nOne of our favorite pieces is this ingeniously designed zipped hoodie, which pairs perfectly with these versatile sweats with a high- or low-rise waist depending on how you roll them.\n\n\"The hoodie is more fitted at the hips than at the waist, which produces a bubbled-over look rather than hanging straight down like most zip hoodies. The sleeves are similarly bubbled at the wrists, so the look is oversized but still fitted. I love the slightly off-the-shoulder opening and the materials are supersoft,\" writes deputy editor Lauren Savoie. \"The 1X/3X is generously sized; I usually wear a 3X and I felt like I had plenty of extra room in the hoodie.\"\n\nRead our full Popflex review to learn more about our favorite styles.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

    "description": "The Coldplay \"kiss cam\" led to harassment for Kristin Cabot, the woman in the video, she says. That should make us all feel bad about the internet.",
    "fullText": "I still feel bad about watching the Coldplay \"kiss cam\" video.\n\nAfter the woman who was caught in the embarrassing moment spoke this week about harassment she endured when the video went viral over the summer … well, I think we should all feel bad.\n\nThis wasn't any of our business. And our reaction to the video says a lot more about us, and about online culture, than it could ever say about the people who were filmed embracing.\n\nI think we can agree that a potential romance between a CEO and an underling isn't appropriate. But the extreme reactions to the video — being doxxed, getting 500 to 600 calls a day, and 50 to 60 death threats, she told The New York Times — weren't about workplace conduct or potential relationship transgressions.\n\nKristin Cabot also spoke to the Times of London this week. She told the newspaper that she might have understood all the attention had she been famous. \"But I'm not some celebrity, I'm just a mom from New Hampshire,\" she told the newspaper. \"Even if I did have an affair, it's not anybody's business.\"\n\nExactly. Everyone, chill. Don't find some random person on the internet and call them at home and yell at them. Come on.\n\nWhen it comes to the idea of the internet doxxing and harassing people, we imagine something like 4chan, or some anonymous sinister force victimizing some innocent person for political or ideological reasons. But what Cabot is describing isn't 4chan trolls. It's people at her local grocery store, and people willing to say mean things using their real names and faces.\n\nThere's a long history of \"the internet\" grabbing onto some viral moment with a stranger and hanging them out to dry. Think of \"West Elm Caleb,\" a man whom several women on TikTok realized they had all met on dating apps. Or \"Couch Guy,\" a young man who TikTok was convinced was cheating on his girlfriend in a viral video. Online mobs doxxed and harassed them in real life.\n\nWhat always felt off to me about the \"kiss cam\" story was that, sure, it was a funny little viral moment. Haha. I watched it and thought it was amusing for a second. But the way it blew up got weird. It became a big national news story. (We covered it at Business Insider, and I wrote about it, too.) It should've been a gag for 2 hours; instead, it made headlines for days.\n\nWe should feel bad that this got so out of control! Yes, I laughed at the video. No, I didn't feel compelled to use facial recognition software to identify the people in it, nor did I tweet at them or call them at home. But some jerks actually did that! And my harmless chuckling eventually led to a cascade of real-world harm to someone who didn't live a public life and whose crime was a dismissible case of misdemeanor canoodling.\n\nIn the interview with The New York Times, Cabot talks about how she's taken accountability for her actions and accepted the consequences of losing her job. We, the internet mob, should do the same: take accountability for being a small part of something that snowballed way out of control.\n\nIf you find yourself fiending for a healthy outlet for messy gossip and drama that you can yell about online, there is an endless buffet for you awaiting on Bravo and ESPN. Let 2026 find you at peace.",

    "fullText": "Erebor Bank, Palmer Luckey's finance startup backed by some of the biggest names in tech, got one step closer to launching after it cleared another key federal hurdle this week.\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. approved Erebor on December 16 with conditions: The bank is subject to a strict capitalization requirement and must have investors ready to provide more funding if called upon.\n\nThe bank still requires final approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. It received preliminary approval from the OCC in October.\n\nTodd Baker, a senior fellow at Columbia University and a consultant to fintech companies who isn't involved with Erebor, said in an email that he would expect Erebor to get approval to open in early 2026.\n\nBaker said in an email that one of the FDIC's requirements — that the bank invoke a capital-call agreement that would require unnamed parties to chip in more cash if certain triggers occur — is \"highly unusual\" but \"entirely appropriate given the expectation that the bank will be taking on significant risks associated with its tech and crypto-focused business plan.\"\n\nA lawyer listed in regulatory documents as an Erebor spokesperson didn't reply to a comment request.\n\nWith funding from Joe Lonsdale and Peter Thiel, Erebor's valuation was reported to be about $2 billion earlier this year. Regulatory documents showed that the bank has brought on talent from both Luckey's tech circles as well as bank and bank-regulatory circles; earlier this month, a cryptocurrency event featured remarks by Erebor's Suzanne Dannheim, a former Goldman Sachs employee.\n\nErebor's founding team set out an ambitious timeline in its pitch to investors. The bank stressed founder Palmer Luckey's \"political network\" — he has contributed large sums to President Donald Trump and other Republican organizations — as a key asset.\n\nWith this recent round of regulatory approval, it may come close to meeting its proposed timeline.\n\nThe FDIC approval process kicked off on July 28, which means it received a green light in roughly 5 months. The median application processed last year took over eight months.\n\nSeveral other new bank applications emphasizing digital services are pending with the OCC and other regulators.\n\nMichele Alt, a bank-licensing consultant, said Erebor's quick turnaround at the FDIC is cause for celebration.\n\n\"The prior average was indicative of an unnecessarily slow-moving process and highly risk averse bureaucracy,\" she said in an email to Business Insider. \"I'm delighted to see more efficient processing of bank charter applications.\"",

    "fullText": "Sky TV has emerged as one of the leading television providers in the UK. While any long-term plan adds up over time, the best Sky TV deals and plans can keep your spending to a minimum.\n\nWe've rounded up some of the best Sky TV deals and plans that are active at the time of writing. These plans feature Sky Stream, which means that you can stream your viewing options over WiFi without any extra hardware. Some deals, like Essential TV, offer you Sky's lowest ever price, while other plans are just handy bundles. All options throw in access to ad-supported Netflix and Discovery Plus.\n\nJust keep in mind that most Sky plans and services are available through long-term contracts (usually 24-month commitments), so it's important to read the fine print before signing up. Sky's website notes that prices may change during the 24-month contract. Most deals only apply to new Sky TV customers.\n\nSky TV also offers a \"build your own\" option, with plans starting at £15/month, and other packages that require a satellite dish or other equipment. If you'd prefer to browse plans at your own leisure, you can head directly to Sky TV's deals page.\n\nSky TV is available across a variety of devices, so you're not just confined to watching on your TV at home. The Sky Go app, for on-the-go streaming, is available on phones, tablets, and laptops.\n\nAll the Sky TV plans we've highlighted include one of the two base packs, either Sky Essential or Sky Ultimate. Sky Essential includes Sky Atlantic (plus Netflix and Discovery Plus) and over 100 other channels. Sky Ultimate carries everything found in Sky Essential, in addition to more than 35 premium channels (such as Sky Max and Sky Witness).\n\nSky also has several deals when you bundle broadband and TV. The broadband deals offer anywhere from 150 to 300 Mbps full fibre broadband with Sky Essential or Sky Ultimate TV (plus other add-ons, such as Sky Sports or Sky Cinema). Prices range from £35 to £55 a month.\n\nA broadband connection is a necessity for both the Sky Stream puck and Sky Glass TV. Sky recommends a minimum speed of 25Mbps. This minimum requirement could change depending on your desired package. Watching in UHD or adding an extra Sky Stream puck device will bring that minimum up to at least 30Mbps.\n\nYou can explore a full roundup of current deals on the Sky website.

    "fullText": "TikTok reached a deal with a group of investors to form a new joint venture for its US business, according to an internal memo viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe deal, which TikTok expects to close in January, comes more than a year after Congress passed a law that forced its owner, ByteDance, to divest from its US operations or face a ban, because TikTok was deemed a \"foreign adversary-controlled\" company.\n\nThe new US joint venture will operate independently in areas like US data protection and training its content recommendation algorithm while still connecting to TikTok's global product and business lines like e-commerce and advertising, per the memo from company CEO Shou Chew.\n\nThe announcement is the culmination of a lengthy battle for survival by TikTok, which briefly went dark in the US in January to comply with the divest-or-ban law.\n\nTikTok and ByteDance had sought recourse through the courts, arguing that the law — the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act — violated the First Amendment. In January, the Supreme Court ruled against TikTok and upheld the divest-or-ban law.\n\nSince then, TikTok has been facing a looming deadline to find a US buyer. The app's future remained in limbo for months as the White House repeatedly extended the deadline and administration officials sought to work out a deal.\n\nIn September, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that approved the sale of TikTok's US operation for around $14 billion.\n\nTrump said at the time that Oracle and Larry Ellison would be part of the deal, and Michael Dell and Rupert Murdoch may also be involved. Vice President JD Vance said the buyer group would include \"four or five world-class investors.\"\n\nTikTok did not respond to a request for comment. The White House referred Business Insider to TikTok.",

    "description": "Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot says a 15-year financial guarantee from Google was the key to unlocking billions in project financing from JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.",
    "fullText": "The \"crypto miner\" label is becoming a relic of the past for Hut 8 (HUT).\n\nIn a move that signals a massive strategic shift, Hut 8 announced a $7 billion deal to build a data center complex in Louisiana for Anthropic (ANTH.PVT). The move effectively trades the volatility of bitcoin (BTC-USD) for the high-margin stability of AI infrastructure.\n\n\"We think that the value of energy will continue to go up, and so for us, we [had] to be patient and figure out what was a fair deal that added value to our customers, but that drove a strong return to our shareholders,\" Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid.\n\nThe market is rewarding the transformation. The energy infrastructure company's stock surged roughly 20% on Wednesday following the announcement as investors cheered its potential to secure blue-chip partners in a crowded field.\n\nBeyond the one-day pop, the stock has been a standout in the mining-to-AI pivot, fueled by the company's deep energy assets and its strategic partnership with American Bitcoin (ABTC), a Trump family enterprise in which Hut 8 holds a 60% stake. Year to date, Hut 8 stock is up 90%.\n\nThe linchpin of the Louisiana project is a financial guarantee from Google (GOOG, GOOGL), which guarantees payments of the 15-year lease if Fluidstack, an AI cloud infrastructure provider, cannot meet them. The deal secures 245 megawatts (MW) of capacity, with the possibility to scale up to 2,300 MW within that timeframe — a move that could swell the total lease value to $17.7 billion.\n\n\"We're very excited because it's the first domino to fall,\" Genoot said. \"If we're able to continue to scale and build up to that full strategic partnership on 2,300 MW, we see a lot of growth upside for the company and the deal overall.\"\n\nThe creditworthiness was the key. Genoot noted that without Google's involvement, securing project financing from titans like JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) at favorable rates would have been nearly impossible.\n\nHe added that Google has a \"strong core business,\" including diversified cash flows from Search, YouTube, and cloud services, making the tech giant's pledge the ultimate security for a 15-year infrastructure play.\n\nHowever, securing the money is only half the battle. Competitors have seen their stocks hammered due to construction delays. Genoot claims Hut 8 has de-risked the execution side, partly by issuing a \"conservative delivery schedule\" and tapping local labor.\n\nThe company has turned to established industrial partners, including Jacobs Engineering for design and local contractors like Cajun Electric for electrical services. By scheduling the first data hall delivery for Q2 2027, Genoot said the company is avoiding the \"crunch\" of unrealistic timelines that has plagued the sector.",

    "description": "People were outraged by the president's recent use of this particular expression. Experts in political science and mental health say the term tells quite the story.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump recently leveled one of his commonly used terms in a statement attacking iconic actor and director Rob Reiner shortly after he and his wife, Michele Singer, were found dead at their home on Sunday.\n\nThe president took to his Truth Social platform on Monday to seize on the opportunity to slam Rob Reiner, who was a critic of Trump, and for baselessly attributing the Hollywood filmmaker’s death to “Trump Derangement Syndrome” — a phrase Trump and his supporters often use to attack those who criticize the president, his policies and his rhetoric.\n\nLife: Psychologists React To THAT Post From Trump About Rob Reiner's Death\n\n“Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS,” Trump wrote in part on the social media platform.\n\nTrump’s vile post about Reiner garnered wide condemnation, with many on social media describinghis remarks as“disgusting.” Rocker Jack White took to Instagram to slam the president, writing: “Trump you disgusting, vile, egomaniac, loser, child. Neither he nor any one of his followers can defend this gross, horrible insult to a beautiful artist who gave the world so much.”\n\nThe president also garnered a rare rebuke from many MAGA supporters and a number of the president’s most loyal advocates. He was further criticized when he doubled down on his attacks on Reiner while speaking to reporters at the Oval Office hours later.\n\nThe concept of a so-called “derangement syndrome” has been used against critics of past presidents before. But Trump has a history of frequently using the phrase against his naysayers himself. He had also used the expression against those who opposed him during his first term as president.\n\nLife: How To Do That 'Defying Gravity' Riff Without Murdering Your Voice\n\nAlexandra Cromer, a licensed professional counselor with Thriveworks, believes that Trump’s habit of leveling the phrase “Trump Derangement Syndrome” reveals a lot about his leadership style.\n\n“It reveals that he is not a leader that values, welcomes, or is willing to receive feedback,” she told HuffPost. “This also is a behavior pattern that we see in people with narcissistic tendencies; projection of perceived criticism onto someone else.”\n\nCromer explained that by Trump calling his critics “deranged,” he’s essentially seeking to undermine “the authenticity of the feedback.”\n\n“This reveals that his leadership style is very rigid and very one-dimensional. He is the one to give directions and all others must comply,” she said. “This is a tremendously unhealthy way to receive criticism or any other form of feedback. Psychologically, we know that feedback is critical to not only growth [and] prosperity, but overall health and wellness.”\n\nLife: The Funniest Posts From Women This Week (Dec. 6-12)\n\nShe later continued, “shutting down criticism by engaging in stereotyping and blaming of the source can also be viewed as abusive behavior — that is, behavior that attempts to inflict psychological harm and maintain power structures.”\n\nHallie Kritsas, a licensed mental health counselor and therapist with Thriveworks who specializes in self-esteem, workplace issues and anxiety, told HuffPost that she believes the term “Trump Derangement Syndrome” is “polarizing and emotionally activating.”\n\n“It comes across as a threat and will more than likely increase stress and divide groups in two different ones versus unifying them,” she said.\n\nJacob Neiheisel, associate professor of political science at the University at Buffalo College of Arts and Sciences, told HuffPost that he thinks Trump’s frequent use of the phrase is “meant to be dismissive of his opposition” and intended to “give his followers cover for dismissing similar criticisms that they might hear.”\n\nLife: The Most Popular Dog Names Of 2025\n\n“I think his use of the term reflects his deep-seated disdain for dissent,” he said. “Trump’s leadership style is certainly not one that is welcoming of a ‘team of rivals’ type of approach, but rather one that demands loyalty and a willingness to do political combat on his behalf.”\n\nNeiheisel thinks that the “Trump Derangement Syndrome” phrase has caught on with so many Trump supporters because it “allows them to adopt a similar orientation toward dissent in their own social environments.”\n\n“Simply dismissing the opposition as having a form of mental illness allows them to protect their own attitudes and beliefs, inoculating them against any negativity directed toward Trump,” he added.\n\nNeiheisel thinks that Trump’s attack on Reiner after his death hit “a new low.”\n\nLife: We Asked Actual Historians About Trump's New Plaques — And They Have THOUGHTS\n\n“Republicans had the moral high ground in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s murder and were able to use the negative things said about Kirk after his death to attack Democrats,” he said. “With Trump’s response, that high ground is gone. I think that’s why we saw a number of Republicans condemning Trump’s remarks.”\n\nKritsas believes that Trump’s statements about the iconic director “violated what some might view as a time to grieve and have decency in a moment of loss.”\n\nCromer said that Trump’s harsh words for Reiner was likely particularly upsetting to so many people because the filmmaker was a “universally liked person.”\n\n“While Rob was not a perfect person (because nobody is), he demonstrated consistent prosocial behavior patterns and centered his personal values at the forefront of his personal and professional life,” she said.\n\n“Further, Trump’s remarks state a belief that someone was murdered because they didn’t like Trump; an assertion that can be viewed as narcissistic by inserting himself into a situation that had nothing to do with him in any contextual way,” she continued.\n\nCromer later added that overall, Trump’s remarks about Reiner “communicates a lack of respect for psychological and personal boundaries for those affected by this incident.”\n\nMedical Examiner Report States Rob And Michele Reiner’s Cause Of Death\n\n2 Of Rob Reiner's Children Release Statement On Parents' Deaths\n\nTrump Blames Rob Reiner For His Own Death In Truth Social Post",

    "fullText": "Americans working with a financial advisor average $132,000 in retirement savings, versus $62,000 for those without one.\n\nThose with advisors plan to retire at 64 compared to 66 for non-advised savers.\n\nAdvised savers are more likely to have emergency funds and long-term plans accounting for economic volatility.\n\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nDoubling your retirement savings may sound like a dream scenario, especially since far too many Americans end up with way less money than they need to support themselves in their 401(k)s, IRAs, and other retirement investment accounts.   In reality, though, ending up with twice as much as the average American doesn't have to be as hard as it seems and it doesn't necessarily require you to make a huge income or to sacrifice all fun spending.\n\nInstead, there's one really simple factor that can give you the best chance of doubling your retirement savings. Unfortunately, many Americans don't know what it is and aren't doing it. You don't have to be one of those Americans. Instead, here's what you need to do to build a big nest egg that beats the average.\n\nNorthwestern Mutual's 2024 Planning and Progress study revealed the simple step that Americans have taken to double their retirement savings. According to the research, those who work with a financial advisor have around twice the retirement investment account balances compared to people who try to manage their retirement investing all on their own with no professional advice.\n\nThe research showed that those who have a financial advisor guiding them have around $132,000 in retirement savings, compared with $62,000 among those with no advisor. Those who have an advisor were also planning to retire at a much younger age -- 64, versus 66 for those who have no advisor assisting them. Being able to retire at a younger age is within reach when you have twice the money in your retirement plan, so this is not a surprise.\n\nIt's not just that people working with an advisor were richer, either. Those who had help with managing their money were significantly more likely to have a long-term plan in place that takes economic ups and downs into account. They were also more likely to have emergency savings that can help keep them out of debt and that makes investing for retirement possible, and they were much more likely to feel financially secure.",

    "title": "SLO County won’t cap housing growth across county anymore — except in one town",
    "description": "The San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors’ decision will allow for a maximum of 25 new homes in one unincorporated town next year.",
    "fullText": "Parts of San Luis Obispo County are set to see the number of allowed housing units increase next year — and the infamously building-averse Los Osos is in line to allow more homes.\n\nOn Tuesday, the San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors held a hearing on growth rate allocations for unincorporated parts of the county, which dictate the maximum number of home permits that can be issued each year.\n\nDuring the meeting, county long range planner Dominic Delporto said in 2025, builders only used around 11% of the maximum countywide dwelling unit allocation, or 112 dwelling units requested out of 1,036 allowed.\n\nOn a more local level, the Nipomo Mesa Water Conservation Area saw 27% of its 134-unit maximum allocation utilized, according to the staff report. Conversely, Los Osos’ 25-dwelling unit allocation went unfilled because though several applications were filed, they were still in the use permit process, long-range planning division manager Corey Hahn said.\n\nAfter receiving a review of countywide dwelling unit allocations for 2025, the board turned its attention to the next year and the changes recommended by staff — namely, the elimination of growth rate limits for the Nipomo Mesa and across the county.\n\nLos Osos, which was under a building moratorium from 1988 to October 2024, was the only exception to the removal of growth rate limits.\n\nLos Osos Community Services District board member Chuck Cesena said the CSD, Golden State Water Co. and S&T Mutual Water Co. — the three water purveyors who tap into the Los Osos Groundwater Basin — found the county staff’s justification for an 0.4% growth rate “unpersuasive.”\n\n“The (Basin Management Committee) also noted the uncertainties in the transient model, but recognized correctly that the model uncertainty implies the impacts may be underestimated as well as overestimated,” Cesena said. “Said another way, uncertainty isn’t a green light, it’s a warning sign.”\n\nDelparto said the county’s local coastal program requires a 1% growth cap for Los Osos, but the annual growth rate is to be established based on reviews of groundwater data, the true limiting factor for the community.\n\nBut the sources of groundwater data that the county relies on weren’t all in agreement on how much the community allows to grow.\n\nWhile the Los Osos Basin Management Committee’s “transient model — which simulates groundwater levels and seawater intrusion in the basin using existing data — recommended that the county adopt a 0% growth rate for Los Osos for 2026, county groundwater sustainability director Blaine Reely said the Board should adopt a growth rate of 0.4%, maintaining the previous year’s maximum of 25 new dwelling units.\n\nThat 0.4% growth rate would essentially be a “rerun” of the current year’s allocation, though of course that’s no guarantee that the allocations will be filled, Hahn said.\n\nLos Osos Community Services District general manager Ron Munds said as data on the health of the Los Osos Groundwater Basin is somewhat spotty — and won’t have a five-year average for water levels established until 2028 — proceeding with caution in expanding the number of allocated dwelling units is the best practice.\n\nSeawater intrusion continues to be an issue for the basin, and must be fully accounted for in any talks of expanding housing in Los Osos — something Munds said he didn’t feel was done in the county staff’s recommended amendment.\n\nMunds said while staff such as Reely may have an idea of what the right amount of water pumping should look like, “they do not know the operational challenges we face on a daily basis, which include water quality issues like seawater intrusion, nitrate contamination, emerging contaminants like PFAS, but also the pumping distribution and constraints that we are trying to implement to maximize the quantity of water that we can pump on any given day to the community.”\n\n“The rate of intrusion is what needs to be steady and confirmed to take the cloud of uncertainty, which I feel is a distraction in this conversation today, out of the discussion,” Munds said. “On that note, one of the county consultants stated that there’s ample time to react to the uncertainty, which I believe is an irresponsible comment and approach when it comes to protecting our community’s only water supply.”\n\nDespite the Los Osos CSD’s warnings of overtapping the basin, the Board voted 4-1 to approve the staff’s amendment, with Supervisor Jimmy Paulding the sole “no” vote, removing growth caps for the unincorporated parts of the county save for Los Osos’ 0.4% cap.\n\nSupervisor Bruce Gibson argued that Los Osos’ cap was a “conservative response” to the concerns voiced by the Los Osos CSD.\n\nAccording to the county staff’s presentation, the 0.4% growth rate for next year had already been reduced from 0.6% to 0.4% to try to address these concerns, though a 0.8% growth rate is prescribed for 2027.\n\nStarting in 2028 and beyond, growth rates can be established based on a five-year rolling average that is currently in the data collection stage, according to the staff report.\n\n“We could certainly justify 0.6% as per the growth management ordinance that’s set out, but keeping the growth rate at 0.4% so we can continue the efforts to exercise the transient model for some different scenarios is more than protective of the groundwater,” Gibson said.\n\nGibson said he supported eliminating the growth cap in the rest of unincorporated San Luis Obispo County because the number of permit requests haven’t approached the cap in recent years.\n\nPaulding said he voted against the growth rate changes because he couldn’t support the elimination of growth caps for the Nipomo Mesa Water Conservation Area.\n\n“It’s no secret that the bulk of the housing that we’re seeing in the unincorporated areas in San Luis Obispo County is occurring in the community of Nipomo,” Paulding said. “This growth management ordinance only looks at when a building permit is processed — it’s not looking at what the number of units in the overall pipeline are based on land use approvals, so it doesn’t give us a good tool to actually measure what’s coming and whether or not we have the infrastructure, resources and services to support that growth.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Speaker Mike Johnson had a ready-made refrain when asked why Republicans weren't moving to extend federal health care subsidies: their party wanted to help 100% of Americans with their costs, not just the 7% of Americans enrolled in Affordable Care Act plans.\n\nBut not 100% of his conference agreed.\n\nA rare revolt from the moderate wing of the party has upended Johnson's plans. Four Republicans this week signed onto a Democratic discharge petition that guarantees that the House will vote on extending the ACA subsidies sometime in January, with Republican leaders now powerless to stop it.\n\nFor Democrats, it was vindication of a months-long strategy, starting with the government shutdown in the fall, that pushed the expiration of the ACA support to the forefront of politics. Republicans from competitive districts most at risk of losing their seats in next year's midterms felt the political pressure as they heard from constituents about their skyrocketing premiums.\n\n“Nothing has changed with House Republican leadership, but something has changed within their own ranks,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar, chair of the House Democratic Caucus.\n\nFlanked by his caucus Thursday on the Capitol steps, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries demanded that Johnson allow a vote on the three-year extension of ACA subsidies before lawmakers leave for the holidays: “Not tomorrow. Not next week. Not next year. Today.”\n\nJohnson refused, saying it will “be on the floor that first week of January when we return.”\n\nLawmakers prepare to leave in limbo\n\nThe impasse left lawmakers with a cliffhanger as they headed home for the holiday break. Republican leaders now face growing pressure to appease centrist members who are threatening to side with Democrats to approve an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies for three years.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune has to confront the issue as well. Any ACA bill clearing the House would simply push the fight to the Senate, which has already rejected a three-year extension.\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has been meeting and discussing possible compromise bills that would extend the subsidies but put new limitations on them. But they would not consider anything until January.\n\nThune told reporters Thursday that a three-year extension of “a failed program that’s rife with fraud, waste and abuse is not happening.”\n\nYet Republican leaders in both chambers have not offered a plan that fully addresses members’ concerns about the sharp insurance cost increases many Americans are expected to face in 2026 and potentially beyond.\n\nThe White House has been engaged in discussions about the healthcare proposals but has largely allowed House Republicans to sort out their internal divisions and coalesce around a plan on their own, according to a senior administration official involved in the talks who was granted anonymity to discuss private discussions.\n\nHouse Republicans on Wednesday passed a 100-plus-page health care package centered on long-standing GOP priorities, including expanding coverage options for small businesses and the self-employed. The bill would also rein in pharmacy benefit managers — middlemen that manage drug costs and process insurance claims.\n\nJohnson touted the measure as “a bigger and better and more important thing for 100% of Americans, not just 7% of Americans.” But some Republicans who face tough reelection bids remain fixated on the looming spike in ACA costs.\n\nThe holidays provide Johnson with a brief window to try to persuade moderates to abandon the effort. The discharge petition froze once it reached the 218-signature threshold, meaning that while only four Republicans have publicly signed on, more may be willing to support the Democratic bill.\n\nRep. Ryan Mackenzie, one of the four Republicans who signed the Democratic petition, said it has “generated more conversations” and that “hopefully over the next three weeks, we will actually see some changes in some bipartisan efforts that actually can generate a meaningful vote that gets 218 in the House and 60 in the Senate.”\n\n“I think allowing a vote is critically important,” Mackenzie said. “I think everybody should be able to put up their votes on the board, and they should be able to let everybody in the American public see how they voted on these individual issues.”\n\nLeader Jeffries' waiting game pays off\n\nFor months, Jeffries refused to support a one-year extension of ACA subsidies that a bipartisan group of lawmakers had been pursuing, dismissing it as a “non-starter” and “a laughable proposition.”\n\nInstead, he held firm on a three-year extension with no income caps or cost offsets. That strategy paid off, as GOP moderates were forced to move in his direction when Johnson refused to allow any vote on an ACA extension.\n\nJeffries has faced criticism this year from progressive members of his caucus and grassroots groups who have urged him to push back more forcefully against Trump and Republicans. But on Thursday, much of the party rallied behind him on the Capitol steps, with several lawmakers praising his approach.\n\n“As Leader Jeffries has said all along, this is the only real plan on the table,” said Aguilar.\n\nStill, while Democrats have secured a vote, insurance costs for millions are set to rise next year, and passage of a three-year ACA subsidies extension remains a long shot even if it does pass the House. Senate Republicans have already rejected the three-year extension, but some GOP senators who are open to a deal on the subsidies said a House vote could provide momentum.\n\n“We could have a vehicle — if we could get Republicans and Democrats behind it — then we could send it back,” said GOP Sen. Thom Tillis, adding that it “means that there’s still a chance.”\n\nFor Democrats, the fight has also allowed them to unify around a message they believe could prove potent on the campaign trail.\n\n“The Republican health care crisis is unacceptable, unconscionable, and un-American,” Jeffries said.\n\nThe decision by four Republicans to break with party leadership and join Democrats is only the latest sign of discontent in the narrowly divided House.\n\nJohnson has argued that the criticism directed at his leadership — and lawmakers repeatedly bypassing leadership to force votes — is inevitable given the slim GOP majority. He said he lacks the advantages of a large majority, where “the speaker had a long stick that he would administer punishment.”\n\n“I don’t have that, because we have a small margin,” he said. Of the ACA extensions, Johnson said leadership had “talked about it at length” with GOP moderates, describing the conversations as “some intense fellowship.”\n\n“Everybody’s in good spirits now and everybody understands what’s happening,” he added.\n\nSome GOP members, however, don’t appear to share that assessment. There was lingering discontent as lawmakers headed home for the holidays.\n\n“I don't know how we did not vote on a good bipartisan extension,” said GOP Rep. Don Bacon, adding that Democrats will use the health care issue “like a sledgehammer” on the campaign trail.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., insisted that Republicans are finishing the year “as united as we've ever been.”\n\n“We set out on a course to do big things, not little things, and that means we’re going to have some differences along the way.”",

    "fullText": "Concerns are growing about how polluted water from roadways is affecting not just the environment but human populations as well.\n\nIn a study published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology Letters, researchers out of the Guangdong Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution and Health took a closer look at tiny particles shed from car tires and the toxic chemicals that they can release over time.\n\nOver the course of the study, 150 urine samples were collected from three different populations across South China. The participants included adults, children, and pregnant women.\n\nThe team discovered that the chemical 6PPD and its toxic byproduct, 6PPD-quinone, were common pollutants in the urine of those tested. In fact, the chemicals were detected in 60-100% of samples.\n\nWhile the researchers acknowledged that both 6PPD and 6PPD-quinone were prevalent in the environment, they noted that there was a lack of studies to determine if these harmful chemicals were making their way inside humans. Since the chemicals are known to be highly toxic to aquatic animals, there are concerns that humans could face similar dangers.\n\nAccording to NOAA Fisheries, scientists developed a test to detect 6PPD-quinone in fish, shellfish, and other marine mammals. They hope that the tool will allow them to track the chemical's movement and buildup in food webs. This could lead to a better understanding of its risks to ecosystems and better stormwater management systems.\n\nIn a study published in Environmental Research, scientists pointed to tire particles as the leading contributor to microplastic pollution. These tiny particles derived from fossil fuels have been linked to a number of severe health issues, including an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurological disorders.\n\nHenry Obanya, a researcher from the University of Portsmouth and lead author of the study, detailed the team's findings in an essay for The Conversation, pushing for the reclassification of harmful chemicals such as 6PPD and 6PPD-quinone.\n\n\"We urgently need to classify tire particles as a unique pollution category,\" Obanya wrote. He noted that because of the array of chemicals used to create tires, we may not know the true impact of the contamination in our bodies until more research is conducted.\n\n\"Tire particles tend to be made from a complex mix of synthetic and natural rubbers, along with hundreds of chemical additives,\" Obanya added. \"This means the consequences of tire pollution can be unexpected and far reaching.\"\n\nHow concerned are you about microplastics in your body?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "TREMONTON, Utah (ABC4) — A sacred rock with petroglyphs important to the Northwestern Band (NWB) of the Shoshone Nation has been restored and returned to its original location after it spent decades at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints meetinghouse.\n\nThe petroglyphs are around 1,200 years old, and they were created by the Fremont people, who were ancestors of the NWB of the Shoshone Nation. The effort to restore the petroglyphs and return them took over a decade, and it involved the NWB of the Shoshone Nation, the state of Utah, and conservators working with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nGrand Canyon trail closures announced for 2026 construction\n\nAccording to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the rock was removed from its original location in the northern Utah mountains about 80 years ago, and it spent the majority of that time outside of the Tremonton meetinghouse.\n\nRyan Saltzgiver, history sites curator for the Church History Department, said that it’s unknown exactly why the 2,500-pound rock was brought to the church, but in 2011, it was discovered by amateur archeologists.\n\nSaltzgiver said that they’ve spent the time since that discovery working with the NWB of the Shoshone Nation and the Utah State Historic Preservation Office to bring everyone together and create a plan for preservation and repatriation.\n\nBYU students’ book supporting mental health nonprofits\n\nBrad Parry, vice chair of the NWB of the Shoshone Nation, said, “Putting it back for us is putting a puzzle piece back into place. Our history is so fractured with a lot of things that happened to us. To have these positive things now that are coming out — it’s rebuilding our history. And I can’t overstate that.”\n\n“We do have a moral and ethical obligation to care for things like this that are in our possession — and in particular to return those things that are, in this case, very sacred objects to those rightful owners,” Saltzgiver said.\n\nThe restoration process was very involved, as conservators chosen by Church historians cleaned years of lichen growth from the rock. They had to clean it without damaging the surface or the petroglyphs, and conservators wound up using soap and water, nontoxic biocide, and steam.\n\nHow to make ABC4 your preferred news source on Google\n\nMegan Randall, an objects conservator with the Midwest Art Conservation Center, said, “Even if it’s not the cleanest, in a couple months or a year, it will continue to sort of clean itself with the application of the biocide. There’s not that many people out there who do this, which makes our work very interesting and varied.”\n\nRandall also highlighted the spiritual importance of the petroglyphs to the tribe. “We want to make those visible and appreciable by the people who find value in this, which is also us,” she said.\n\nThe rock was returned to its original location near the Utah-Idaho border, joining its companion petroglyphs. A ceremony was held, including a blessing from a Shoshone tribal spiritual leader.\n\n“This rock was meant to be here. It’s like this rock knows it’s home,” Parry said.\n\nTimeline: Court proceedings for Tyler Robinson, man accused of killing Charlie Kirk\n\nUTA to upgrade bus fleet using $41 million in federal funding\n\nCapitol Conversations: Rep.

    "title": "ChatGPT Works With Apple Music Now, for Some Reason",
    "description": "You can't even play full songs in ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "When ChatGPT first launched, it was strictly about dealing with text. You could ask it to write you a poem, to check your code for errors, or to build you a grocery list from a recipe. Fast forward three years, and the app has changed completely—for better or for worse. Not only has ChatGPT's large language model (LLM) improved dramatically from GPT-3.5 to GPT-5.2, but the bot has gone multimodal. It can understand text, but also images, video, and the internet at large. 2025's ChatGPT is hardly the same product as 2022's.\n\nOne of the many upgrades to ChatGPT over the past three years has been app integrations: You've been able to connect OpenAI's chatbot to ask it to do things on your behalf. You could connect to Expedia to ask ChatGPT for help booking a hotel, Zillow to ask the bot to help you find an apartment, or Canva for help with creating a slide. Whether these integrations are any more useful than simply using the respective app itself is perhaps up to each user, but these integrations exist all the same.\n\nFidji Simo, OpenAI's CEO of applications, announced the integration in a Substack post on Tuesday. Among other updates, like a new image gen model and new writing tools, Simo revealed new app integrations for the chatbot, including OpenTable, Salesforce, Clay, Lovable, and, of course, Apple Music. At the time, details were limited, but now, the integration is officially live.\n\nFirst of all, you don't actually need to It's an interesting note, since Apple Music itself requires a paid subscription to access. But with ChatGPT, you can access elements of the services without paying—keyword \"elements.\"\n\nOnce you connect the services together, you'll be able to search Apple Music for songs, artists, albums, and playlists within ChatGPT. In addition to music discoverability, you can also generate playlists, and listen to clips of songs you find. ChatGPT doesn't specify how long those clips are, but if they base it off of iTunes, it could be anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. If you thought this integration was all about listening to Apple Music tunes while using ChatGPT, think again: You'll still need Apple Music itself for the listening side of things.\n\nOf course, if you have an Apple Music account, the integration is a bit more useful. If so, you'll be able to add songs, albums, and playlists to your Apple Music library that you found or generated from ChatGPT.\n\nLove it or hate it, ChatGPT isn't necessarily designed with user privacy in mind. After all, part of the company's business model is training its LLMs on your ChatGPT interactions—unless you specifically opt out. As such, the idea of connecting your Apple Music subscription to ChatGPT raises some privacy alarm bells in my mind. Apple Music doesn't have the most sensitive user information in your digital portfolio, but it does contain quite a bit of extra data ChatGPT can collect from you.\n\nAt the top of the Apple music connection tool, OpenAI says, \"You're in control.\" The company is adamant that ChatGPT \"always respects\" your preferences on training data, and is held to the permissions you've already set. That said, the company also warns that by using apps, you run the risk of falling victim to attack: If hackers decide to attack ChatGPT, your data could get swooped up. You'll also end up sharing data points like your IP address and approximate location, as well as ChatGPT data with Apple Music. (The data sharing goes both ways here.)\n\nOne benefit here is that ChatGPT doesn't appear to have access to your listening history. While the app can create playlists for you, it can't actually see what you're choosing to listen to in Apple Music itself.\n\nI personally don't use ChatGPT, and even if I did, I don't think I'd connect my Apple Music account here. I find the discoverability within the app itself fine for my needs, and when it isn't, the greater internet already helps me find new music. I'm not sure I'd feel the benefits of ChatGPT's intelligence here, especially when it comes with the risk of keeping all my Apple Music data in yet another location.\n\nIf you're not like me, and you're interested in trying out this integration, you can connect Apple Music to ChatGPT from the latter's app or web app. Head to the sidebar, choose Apps, then find and select \"Apple Music.\"",

    "description": "You can connect apps like Photoshop, Apple Music, and Slack to ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "Earlier this year, OpenAI announced ChatGPT apps. Not the ChatGPT app, mind you: That's been out for more than a couple years now. ChatGPT apps, on the other hand, are programs that work within ChatGPT. You can access them in any given conversation with ChatGPT—in fact, they may appear based on the context of the conversation.\n\nThese aren't necessarily apps that OpenAI builds itself, either; rather, you'll find options here based on apps you may use yourself. The initial batch of apps included with the feature's rollout included Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Figma, Expedia, Spotify, and Zillow—big apps you've likely used before.\n\nWhile in a conversation with ChatGPT, you could ask the bot to help you book a flight to Paris via Expedia, find a particular listing through Zillow, or create a slide for a presentation with Canva. From OpenAI's perspective, this adds a host of additional functionality to ChatGPT the company couldn't offer itself. OpenAI doesn't need to build an apartment-hunting tool into ChatGPT; it can just pull in Zillow. It also doesn't escape me that the more apps that OpenAI folds into ChatGPT, the less likely it is you'll need to leave ChatGPT to do something in another app—but that's none of my business.\n\nSpeaking of more apps, the company plans to expand these apps overtime, as developers create ChatGPT-compatible extensions for their programs. That was part of yesterday's news: OpenAI is now letting developers submit apps to ChatGPT en masse. What's more, these apps will be hosted in an \"app directory,\" though many online are taking to calling it an app store. (There's no payment necessary, however, so app directory might really be a more apt description.) You'll find this new app directory in the sidebar of ChatGPT, appropriately called \"Apps.\"\n\nApps is apparently in beta, according to a label affixed to its title in ChatGPT. Here, you'll find a rotating slide featuring an ad for some of the service's biggest apps, like Canva and Zillow, and, below it, rows of apps to choose from. Right now, the apps are sorted into \"Featured,\" \"Lifestyle,\" and \"Productivity,\" with no option that includes all the apps. (But they seem to be entirely split across Lifestyle and Productivity.) There are a lot of options here already. Some made headlines this week, like Photoshop and Apple Music, while others arrived more quietly, like Asana, Uber, and Target. It's not just traditional apps like Zillow or Spotify that are getting the app treatment here, either. OpenAI is also considering \"connector\" services, like Google Drive, as \"apps.\"\n\nYou can click on any app in the directory to see what you can do with it. Slack, for example, says you can look up your chats and messages to summarize threads, generate recaps, and come up with responses. You can check on your Asana tasks to generate progress reports and status updates. Outlook says you can create \"talking points\" and generate follow-ups from your emails and calendar events. While there's a brief summary underneath each title, you'll need to click through to each service to see the full picture of what it actually offers.\n\nHere are the apps I'm seeing at this time. Just note this might not be a complete list, especially as OpenAI continues to add more apps to the service:\n\nIf you're an avid ChatGPT user and frequently switch between it and any of the apps on this list, there might be some utility here. Maybe coders will find the integration with Hugging Face and Lovable to be beneficial, while Photoshop users might take advantage of the AI image editing tools this integration provides. But I'm still left feeling like this is more gimmick than anything else: I don't need to connect my Slack to ChatGPT to generate follow-ups for me: I'm perfectly capable of responding to emails myself, and managing my own calendar, so no need to connect Outlook or another email client to the bot. Maybe a future update will sell me on connecting generative AI to all aspects of my work and personal life, but so far, I'm still not convinced.",

    "fullText": "After an intense debate on player availability and the timing of the tournament, the focus has begun to shift to the pitch as another mid-season edition of the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) kicks off in Morocco on Sunday.\n\nOn the face of it, the two main talking points ahead of the 2025 finals are whether the host nation can extend their world record run of 18 consecutive wins and claim just a second title, and if Mohamed Salah will finally lift the trophy with Egypt.\n\nThe 33-year-old's future at Liverpool has dominated headlines since his explosive assertion on 6 December that he has been \"thrown under the bus\" by the club.\n\nAfter making his return from the bench at Anfield last Saturday, Salah will now be focused on his fifth attempt to clinch the continent's biggest prize - especially after two previous defeats in finals.\n\nBut concentrating on just two topics would not do justice to a unique tournament characterised by unpredictability.\n\nIvory Coast delivered a remarkable home success in February last year, having sacked their coach during the group stage, while Senegal's fine form was underlined by their win over England in June.\n\nElsewhere, Nigeria aim to go one better than at the 2023 finals but fellow heavyweights Cameroon appear, from the outside, to be in chaos - with both countries looking to make amends after missing out on the 2026 Fifa World Cup.\n\nWith seven different winners from the past eight editions, Morocco 2025 is certain to be a compelling watch as sides battle for a trophy hailed as the \"holy grail of African football\" by Benin assistant coach Tunde Adelakun.\n\n\"It's so hard to win the Africa Cup of Nations. People love us a lot, but if [you] win they will never forget you,\" Morocco midfielder Sofyan Amrabat told the BBC World Service.",
