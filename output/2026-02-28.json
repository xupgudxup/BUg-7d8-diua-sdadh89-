ON THE APP STORE\n\nLast season saw Chelsea pick up a Conference League trophy and then a Club World Cup in the summer. Domestically, they qualified for the Champions League.\n\nThat was a success compared to recent years, but we’ve fallen a long way from competing for the title.\n\nWinger Pedro Neto had not won trophies before in his career, so he was delighted. But he feels the pressure of being at a big club now:\n\n“When you play here, you have a lot of expectations, like if you can be champion or not, if you can make the Champions League or not, and if you don’t do it, the pressure is a lot,” the winger said in quotes picked up by the club’s website.\n\nPedro Neto celebrates against Cardiff. (Photo by Dan Istitene/Getty Images)\n\n“It’s good pressure and you only get affected by that if you let it, but it’s the standards of this club.”\n\n“I came to this club to win trophies as we did in my first season. It was an unbelievable first season for me. The second one, we have a long way to go, we have a lot to fight for. So the expectations are really big. Of course, we have the expectation to do better every year. To be at a top club, the responsibility is bigger as well.”\n\nWell, if we want to keep standards high, we need to beat Arsenal tomorrow, it’s as simple as that. If we don’t make it into the Champions League, we will have had a worse season than last season, and there will be no denying this was a step back.\n\nNeto also spoke about making changes to his game. Let’s not forget, he’s still just 24 and can develop a lot with the right coaching and attitude.\n\nCheck out the latest edition of Simon Phillips’ SPTC podcast here:",

    "fullText": "Juventus have long expressed an interest in signing Victor Osimhen, and reports suggest the striker is also keen on the move, indicating mutual interest between the parties.\n\nOsimhen remains one of the most highly regarded forwards in European football and continues to enhance his reputation. Currently playing for Galatasaray, he has consistently demonstrated his quality on the international stage. If he maintains his current standards, it is widely expected that he will represent another elite club in the future.\n\nJuventus are reportedly eager to reunite Osimhen with Luciano Spalletti, with whom he previously worked during their successful spell at Napoli. The striker played a pivotal role in firing the Partenopei to the Serie A title in 2023. He has admitted in the past that he was interested in joining Juventus while still at Napoli, although Galatasaray ultimately acted more swiftly to secure his services.\n\nThe Turkish club view Osimhen as one of their most important players and would be reluctant to sanction his departure without significant compensation. As such, Juventus face a considerable challenge if they wish to complete a deal, particularly if his contractual situation does not favour an immediate transfer.\n\nZhegrova, Gatti, Osimhen and Perin (Photo by Stefano Guidi/Getty Images)\n\nAccording to Tuttojuve, Marco Piccari has addressed the prospect of a future move. He said, “As for Juventus, I don’t rule out the possibility of him wearing that jersey in the future, but the clause makes the deal complicated in the immediate future. It seems like a situation that needs to be monitored over time rather than resolved next season. Right now, I see it as a long way off, but in football, you never say never.”\n\nHis remarks reveal the complexity of the situation. While the ambition to unite Osimhen and Juventus may persist, any agreement appears dependent on contractual details and evolving circumstances in the transfer market.",

    "description": "The Peloton instructor and running coach shares some the advice she’s received — and given",
    "fullText": "There is a difference between good and bad running advice\n\nBecs Gentry — runner, mother and Peloton instructor — shares the worst and best advice she's gotten\n\nShe tells PEOPLE what gets her to lace up her shoes\n\nBecs Gentry has heard a lot of bad advice in her career. The running coach, Peloton instructor and Global Ambassador for HOKA tells PEOPLE there’s “so much” bad advice people have given her without knowing she’s a running coach.\n\n“It's funny because a lot of the time I won't tell people what I do or I'm a runner, I’ll say I'm a runner and not a coach for over a decade. Then they'll say many funny things,” Gentry, 39, shares.\n\nOne of the worst things she hears is when people buy new outfits for races and wear their new clothes for the first time on race day.\n\n“It feels really bougie to wear those brand new sneakers and that corny running top from the bag and take the labels off and you feel so fancy, but you need to have worn it at least once. When it comes to sneakers, you need to have at least, like, 10 miles in those trainers before you put them on race day,” Gentry says.\n\nShe also says to be wary of anyone who tells you should keep running and don’t stop to use the bathroom, despite what your body might be telling you.\n\n“Please stop, use a restroom and let us the rest of the runners have a nice race, not be going down when somebody who has made a mess on themselves, because then really the time doesn't matter. The humility is better,” Gentry shares.\n\nOne big piece of advice she has for those who are looking to get into running is to understand the “end goal,” and break down the different ways to get there.\n\n“It's really important to scale it back and see your long-term goal. Break it down,\" she says, explaining that you need to have a \"short-term goal in order to get there, like, 'I'm gonna need to start walking every day.' Understand that walking and running at the same thing, it's a different pace. I use that mantra for all of my coaching forward as a pace of as long as you're moving forward, you're still getting towards your goal it doesn't matter how fast you're moving, you're moving.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nPeople often forget, Gentry says, that there is a process involved with getting faster and doing as many races and they can.\n\n“You can do it, you have to find your route. More often than not, your route is gonna involve some walking and that's super cool because you're gonna take it steady. I hope that most people's goal for starting running is that it's something to do with longevity. That they want to be healthy for as long as possible and be present on this planet for as long as possible,” the running coach shares. “Take as long as possible as you can to get to that goal healthily, because then you'll keep going at it. If you rush anything, it's not gonna be your best output.”\n\nThe longtime runner shares that her personal favorite thing about running is “the release it gives me.”\n\n“Having gone through so many different chapters of my life with running as my best friend by my side, it has given me the chance to switch my mind off from stress. It's given me the opportunity to get completely lost in a podcast or reminisce over some nineties playlist,\" Gentry says. \"It's like the Rolodex is in a complete mess when I start a run some days and I go through it and it's perfectly alphabetized and looking pristine by the time I get back.”",

    "fullText": "Ilia Topuria is still brushing off Arman Tsarukyan’s skills as a legitimate threat.\n\nTopuria and Tsarukyan have been trading words since June, when the Spaniard claimed the lightweight belt with a knockout win over Charles Oliveira at UFC 317.\n\nAfter taking over from Islam Makhachev as champion, many felt Tsarukyan deserved the first shot. But Justin Gaethje’s win over Paddy Pimblett for the interim belt set up a different unification bout against Topuria.\n\nThe champ seemed to have no issues with that route. He had already said he would vacate the belt before facing Tsarukyan, making his feelings on that fight clear.\n\nIlia Topuria’s latest remarks about Arman Tsarukyan came during an appearance on Adin Ross’ Kick stream, where he dismissed the idea that Tsarukyan would be his toughest challenge in the division.\n\nDuring the conversation, Topuria went a step further, claiming that a fight with ‘Ahalkalakets’ would be straightforward and confident it wouldn’t pose much of a threat.\n\nThe champion didn’t stop there. He also questioned Tsarukyan’s finishing ability and suggested his style relies more on wearing down tired opponents than creating opportunities.\n\n“He lost to Islam. He lost to (Mateusz) Gamrot. He got knocked out in the beginning of his career. And he doesn’t really have the ability to finish the fight,” said Topuria.\n\n“He only finishes the fights when his opponent gets tired, and he just goes on the ground and does ground and pound and all that.”\n\nTopuria finished by saying: “Arman, easy. Because he will panic. With me, he will panic.”\n\nBut it’s unlikely his prediction will ever be put to the test, with the pair appearing to be on different paths. Many believe a move up to 170 pounds is in Topuria’s near future, and Tsarukyan may not fit into those plans.\n\nThe popular expectation is for Topuria to return this summer for a title unification bout against Gaethje before making the jump to welterweight. If he does make that move, ‘El Matador’ will find himself in pursuit of another belt – looking to become only the third triple champion in UFC history.\n\nThe popular expectation is for Topuria to return this summer for a title unification bout against Gaethje before making the jump to welterweight. If he does make that move, ‘El Matador’ will find himself in pursuit of another belt – looking to become only the third triple champion in UFC history.\n\nDespite being ranked number one by the time of his comments and being widely considered deserving of a shot at the belt, Tsarukyan was overlooked by Dana White and company due to an ongoing suspension by NAC which had kept him inactive until December 2024.\n\nTopuria had shown no interest in defending his lightweight crown against Tsarukyan even after winning it from Makhachev. He previously stated that he’d rather vacate his title than face him.\n\nFans choose Gable Steveson and Dakota Ditcheva as top UFC signings for Dana White\n\nDana White announces UFC White House card will be revealed later this week\n\nDana White and UFC sued by fans over pay-per-view prices during $1.5 billion deal with ESPN",

    "fullText": "Across football, there are several stars from 'lesser' leagues who look primed for transfers to Europe's top-five leagues this summer.\n\nClubs are queuing up to land Kees Smith this summer, with Real Madrid,Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool linked.\n\nAfter a breakout season at AZ Alkmaar in 2024-25, Smit shone during the summer, where he was the top scorer and named Player of the Tournament as the Netherlands won the European Under-19 Championship.\n\nA technical midfielder, Smit has continued to take strides forward this season, as part of an AZ team making good progress in theConference League. A full Dutch debut is not beyond Smit this season, who could be a late bolter for the Netherlands' World Cup squad.\n\nGiven the mixed record of Primeira Liga striker exports, some will take caution when pursuing Samu Agehowa this summer. But, goals aside, the 21-year-old appears to have all the tools required to thrive in a top-five league.\n\nThe 6ft 4in forward is an unmissable penalty-box presence, but mobile and quick enough to stretch defences too. Porto will demand a premium price for a player who has scored 47 goals in 76 games for the club.\n\nSome top talent has passed through FC Nordsjalland in recent years, with Mikkel Damsgaard and Mohammed Kudus among thePremier League names the club counts as former alumni.\n\nNext up could be Caleb Yirenkyi, whose list of suitors is growing fast. The 20-year-old has already become a regular with Ghana after a series of impressive performances, with Yirenkyi ranking among the Danish Superliga's top performers for assists, tackles won, and fouls drawn.\n\nManchester United and Liverpool have monitored his displays, while Brighton were rumoured to have a bid rejected in January. The Seagulls certainly know a thing or two about defensive midfield gems.\n\nMika Godts is having a standout season at Ajax. After flashes of talent last term, Godts has exploded as an Eredivisie star in 2025-26.\n\nThe Belgian winger has 13 goals and eight assists for Ajax in the league, with no player in the Dutch top flight directly involved in more goals. At just 20, Godts has earned comparisons to compatriot Eden Hazard.\n\nExpect a scramble for his signature in the summer, particularly if Ajax miss out onChampions League qualification.\n\nThe Red Bull Salzburg production line has somewhat slowed down in recent years, but Joane Gadou might just speed up the conveyor belt.\n\nThe imposing French defender has been a standout in Salzburg, having left the Paris Saint-Germain academy for Austria.\n\nThe 6ft 5in centre-back has already racked up more than 50 senior appearances for Salzburg, despite only turning 19 last month. He hopes to follow fellow Frenchman Dayot Upamecano and Ibrahima Konate in passing through the Red Bull network on route to the top.",

So there’s many things.”\n\nThere’s been some confusion over the exact length of Saka’s new contract, with initial reports that it was a “five-year deal” to 2031, but subsequent claims it’s more of a “five-season” deal to 2030.\n\nIn effect, that would mean the contract actually lasts four-and-a-half years, taking us to the end of the current campaign and then four years beyond that.\n\nArsenal and Saka have been in contract talks for quite a while now, so it’s possible the confusion stems from the fact that when negotiations stepped up last summer, it was five years to 2030 at the time.\n\nEither way, the deal will last until Saka is in his late twenties. If it ends in 2030, he’ll be a few months away from his 29th birthday. If it’s a year later, he’ll be almost 30.\n\nSaka’s new deal will make him Arsenal’s best-paid player, on wages in excess of £300,000 per week. His previous contract was due to expire in 2027, so this was definitely one the club needed to get sorted before moving into his final season.\n\nThe focus is now purely on football, staying fit, and winning trophies. Saka has eight goals and seven assists this season, with Arsenal still competing in four competitions. But nothing is won yet, and the team will need their best players to keep stepping up.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool made a decision to let Harry Wilson go back in 2021.\n\nThe Welshman moved to Fulham initially on loan with a permanent four-year deal attached to the agreement.\n\nIt’s been a stunning success for the playmaker - who enjoyed one season in the Championship with the Cottagers before making waves as a Premier League regular.\n\nThis season he has been his side’s chief creative weapon - scoring eight times in the top flight and providing five assists.\n\nFurthermore he has been in excellent form for his national side - scoring a hat-trick against North Macedonia back in November en route to a FIFA World Cup semi-final playoff spot.\n\nWith a contract expiring in summer 2026 the 67-cap international looks set to become one of the hottest properties of the free agent market.\n\nLiverpool have been linked with a move for their homegrown youth product - who featured only twice for the first team before embarking on a career elsewhere.\n\nHis Anfield career was characterised by multiple loan spells - at Crewe, Hull, Derby, Bournemouth and Cardiff - before he got fixed up with his current employers.\n\nAnd a return to Merseyside could beckon for Wilson - who has featured as a right-sided midfielder, right-winger, attacking midfielder and even as a false 9 for his country this season.\n\nThat means it would be a smart pick-up for Arne Slot - for a player who knows the league and the club inside out.\n\nAlthough his age might go against him - he will be 29 before next season kicks off - the fact that he’s got no transfer fee attached makes this an intelligent transfer.\n\nAnd Liverpool insider Ian Doyle at the Liverpool Echo isn’t dismissing the links out of hand - although he questions whether or not Wilson would be prepared to be a rotation player.\n\n“Wilson will be available on a free transfer this summer, although Fulham haven't given up hope of agreeing a new contract with the Wales international,” he writes.\n\n“Given he will be 29 in the summer, there's little chance under Fenway Sports Group's usual transfer policy that Liverpool would be interested if there was a fee involved.\n\n“Would you take him as a squad option? Absolutely, especially with Liverpool needing to bolster their overall numbers. He knows the club and has plentiful experience at Premier League and international level.\n\n“Could he be a direct replacement for Salah? That job perhaps will go to someone else. But the real question is whether Wilson would want to return to being a squad player having been a top-flight regular since leaving Anfield in 2021.”",

    "fullText": "At one stage, it looked inevitable that Aston Villa would secure a Premier League top-three finish, yet the mood in the West Midlands has shifted to concern.\n\nVilla, once the most in-form side in the league, now find themselves dragged into a tense battle for the top five.\n\nWith only one win in their last five league outings, they have surrendered their grip on the title race and handed rivals fresh motivation to displace them in the table.\n\nTheir latest setback was a frustrating 2-0 defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers in Friday night’s West Midlands derby.\n\nAfter the match, manager Unai Emery admitted to a creeping sense of panic within his squad, acknowledging the frustration of giving competitors a chance to capitalise on their struggles.\n\nAs quoted in The Metro, the Spaniard reflected:\n\n“In September, I was worried, and the objective was to stay in the Premier League. In December, I was so happy and excited to get the top-five position and achieve the Champions League.\n\n“One month ago, I was dreaming about maybe winning the Premier League. Now we are in the average to be in the top five.\n\n“Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United, they are trying to get to us, for them it is a priority to get into the Champions League.”\n\nThat anxiety may soon be justified. Should Manchester United dispatch Crystal Palace on Sunday, they would leapfrog into third place, leaving Villa with the daunting task of reclaiming the position.\n\nBut the fixture list offers little respite for the Villans: clashes against fellow Champions League hopefuls Chelsea and then a trip to Old Trafford next weekend make Emery’s quest for a top-three finish increasingly difficult.\n\nFor United, however, the opportunity is clear. Going third is not one they can afford to squander, unlike the many chances to climb the table wasted under Ruben Amorim.\n\nNow unbeaten in ten matches, six of them under caretaker head coach Michael Carrick, United have built momentum that could even propel them into the title conversation, provided they sustain this flawless run.\n\nFeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

Friday's downhill winner Corinne Suter of Switzerland was third, another one-tenths back.\n\nItaly's Federica Brignone was no factor in her first race since double super-g and giant slalom Olympic gold as she trailed Aicher by more than two seconds in 15th place.\n\nAicher failed to finish the Olympic super-g after her downhill and team combined silvers but is now the first skier with two World Cup season wins in the discipline - for an overall season tally of three and five in her career.\n\n\"I don't think it was fully executed. During the run I thought to myself: Ski a little more consistently! But maybe it worked out quite well,\" Aicher told German broadcasters ARD.\n\nAustrian skier Ricarda Haaser had a heavy fall and was taken away on a rescue sled. The Austrian team spoke of \"a severe knee injury\", with news reports saying she suffered a left tibial plateau fracture.\n\nHaaser had only returned to action in December from a cruciate ligament and meniscus tear in her right knee.\n\nSofia Goggia of Italy placed sixth and continues to lead the super-g standings, but is now only 20 points ahead of Robinson. Aicher, who is also in the running for the downhill title, is third with a deficit of 96 points.\n\nThere are three races left in the discipline with a maximum 300 points available.\n\nSaturday's race replaced a cancelled one in Altenmarkt-Zauchensee, Austria, and another super-g is scheduled for Sunday in Soldeu.\n\nAmerican star Mikaela Shiffrin is not competing in Soldeu but retained the overall World Cup lead ahead of also absent Swiss Camille Rast and Aicher.",

    "title": "Move over, Apple: Meet alternative app stores available in the EU and elsewhere",
    "description": "A list of some of the alternative app stores iPhone users in the EU can try today.",
    "fullText": "People in the European Union are now allowed to access alternative app stores thanks to the Digital Markets Act (DMA), a regulation designed to foster increased competition in the app ecosystem. Like Apple’s App Store, alternative app marketplaces allow for easy access to a wider world of apps on Apple devices, but instead of the apps going through Apple’s App Review process, the apps on these third-party marketplaces have to go through a notarization process to ensure they meet some “baseline platform integrity standards,” Apple says — like being malware-free. However, each store can review and approve apps according to its own policies. The stores are also responsible for any matters relating to support and refunds, not Apple.\n\nTo run an alternative app marketplace, developers must accept Apple’s alternative business terms for DMA-compliant apps in the EU. This includes paying a new Core Technology Fee of €0.50 for each first annual install of their marketplace app, even before the threshold of 1 million installs is met, which is the bar for other EU apps distributed under Apple’s DMA business terms.\n\nDespite the complicated new rules, a handful of developers have taken advantage of the opportunity to distribute their apps outside of Apple’s walls.\n\nBeyond the EU, other markets are experimenting with alternative app stores, as well, like Japan. In December 2025, Apple announced its compliance with the Mobile Software Competition Act (MSCA), which gives developers new options to distribute apps and process payments outside of Apple’s App Store.\n\nThis option also requires developers to accept new business terms, like a reduced 10% to 21% App Store commission, a payment processing fee for Apple in-app purchases of 5%, a core technology fee of 5%, and a 15% store services commission on web sales made through a link in the app.\n\nBelow is a list of the alternative app stores iPhone users in these markets can try today.\n\nCo-created by developer Riley Testut, maker of the Nintendo game emulator app Delta, AltStore PAL is an officially approved alternative app marketplace in the EU. The open source app store will allow independent developers to distribute their apps alongside the apps from AltStore’s makers, Delta, and a clipboard manager, called Clip.\n\nUnlike Apple’s App Store, AltStore apps are self-hosted by the developer. To work, developers download an alternative distribution packet (ADP) and upload it to their server, then create a “source” that users will add to the AltStore to access their apps. That means the only apps you’ll see in the AltStore are those you’ve added yourselves.\n\nSome popular apps that users are adding include the virtual machine app UTM, which lets you run Windows and other software on iOS or iPad; OldOS, a re-creation of iOS 4 that’s built in SwiftUI; Kotoba, the iOS dictionary available as a stand-alone app; torrenting app iTorrent; qBittorrent remote client for iOS devices called qBitControl; and social discovery platform PeopleDrop.\n\nMacPaw’s Setapp became one of the first companies to agree to Apple’s new DMA business terms to set up an alternative app store for EU users. Unfortunately, this app store didn’t last long — the company announced it would sunset the Setapp Mobile service on February 16, 2026. (Applications on Setapp Desktop weren’t affected.) MacPaw stated that “still-evolving and complex business terms that don’t fit Setapp’s current business model” are the reason for its decision.\n\nThe company had long offered a subscription-based service featuring a selection of curated apps for customers on iOS and Mac. Following the implementation of the DMA, it released the alternative app store for Setapp Mobile for iOS users only in the EU. Similar to its other subscription offerings, the now-shuttered app store had included dozens of apps under a single recurring subscription price, and the number of apps grew over time. The apps were free from in-app purchases or ads and are generally considered high quality. However, it didn’t include big-name apps like Facebook, Uber, Netflix, and others.\n\nFortnite maker Epic Games launched its alternative iOS app store in the EU in August 2024, allowing users to download games, including its own Fortnite and others like Rocket League Sideswipe and Fall Guys, with more to come. The company said it’s also bringing its games to other alternative app stores, including AltStore PAL, which it’s now supporting via a grant, as well as Aptoide’s iOS store in the EU and ONE Store on Android.\n\nThe move to launch Fortnite in alternative iOS marketplaces comes more than four years after Apple removed the game from its App Store over policy violations, ahead of Epic’s legal challenge to the alleged App Store monopoly. While U.S. courts decided that Apple was not engaged in antitrust behavior, the lawsuit did pave the way for developers to link to their own websites for a reduced commission.\n\nAn alternative game store for iPhone, Lisbon-based Aptoide is an open source solution for app distribution. The company, already known for its Google Play alternative, says it scans the apps to ensure they are safe to download and install.\n\nThe iOS version of the Aptoide store launched as an invite-only beta in June 2024 before becoming available to all across the EU. As a free-to-use store, Aptoide doesn’t charge its users to cover its Core Technology Fee paid to Apple, but takes a 10% to 20% commission on in-app purchases on iOS, depending on whether they were generated by the marketplace or not.\n\nAcross all platforms, including Android, web, car, and TV, Aptoide offers 1 million apps to its more than 430 million users.\n\nA B2B-focused app store, the Mobivention marketplace allows EU companies to distribute their internal apps that are used by employees, but can’t — or shouldn’t — be published in Apple’s App Store. The company also offers the development of a customized app marketplace for companies that want to offer employees their own app store just for their corporate apps. Larger companies can even license Mobivention’s technology to more deeply customize the app marketplace to their own needs.\n\nLast March, Skich announced the launch of an alternative app store for EU users, which differentiates itself by offering a Tinder-like interface for app discovery. That is, users swipe right to “match” with apps they might enjoy. They can also create playlists and see which apps their friends are playing. The new store will replace Skich’s existing app and will see the company taking a 15% commission on all purchases. Instead of filling its app store with apps right away, the store marketed to developers at the Game Developers Conference (GDC).\n\nOnside is an alternative iOS app store available in both the EU and, now, Japan, as of February 17, 2026, thanks to the new regulations. The company promises it will charge developers lower rates while still offering security, including keeping payment information private. The store currently supports bank card payments and Apple Pay and will later roll out support for other payment methods like iDeal, Klarna, and more.\n\nFor consumers, Onside touts a range of top apps and exclusives that can’t be found on other marketplaces within a familiar interface that includes traditional app store features, like editorial collections, ratings and reviews, and automatic updates.",

    "fullText": "Plans to return humans to the moon will come in later mission as agency grapples with delays and glitches\n\nNasa announced on Friday radical changes to its delayed Artemis III mission to land humans back on the moon, as the US space agency grapples with technical glitches and criticism that it is trying to do too much too soon.\n\nThe abrupt shift in strategy was laid out by the space agency’s recently confirmed administrator, Jared Isaacman. Announcing the changes on Friday, he said that Nasa would introduce at least one new moon flight before attempting to put humans back on the lunar surface for the first time in more than half a century, in 2028.\n\nThe new, more incremental approach would give the Nasa team a chance to test flight and refine its technology. As part of the changes, the Artemis II mission to fly humans around the moon this year, without landing, would also be pushed back from its latest scheduled launch on 6 March to 1 April at the earliest.\n\n“Everybody agrees this is the only way forward,” Isaacman told reporters at a news conference. “I know this is how Nasa changed the world, and this is how Nasa is going to do it again.”\n\nThe revised course came as Nasa has been wrestling with a number of delays and technical problems. Earlier this week, the independent body that reviews space safety issued a blunt report sharply criticising the space agency’s current plans as too risky.\n\nThe aerospace safety advisory panel recommended that Nasa rethink its objectives for Artemis III, which had been conceived as the first human landing on the moon since the final flight in the Apollo series in December 1972. The panel said that the call for a revision was urgent, “given the demanding mission goals”.\n\nIsaacman said that under the new plan, the eventual moon landing would be achieved through evolutionary steps rather than big leaps in technological procedures. “We’re going to get there in steps, continue to take down risk as we learn more and we roll that information into subsequent designs,” he told CBS News.\n\nHe added: “We’ve got to get back to basics.”\n\nStep one in the revised schedule is the launch of the Artemis II moon mission, which has been plagued by delays. The rocket was returned to its hangar at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida earlier this week.\n\nEngineers had discovered a blockage in the rocket’s helium flow in the upper stage of the booster.\n\nThe latest delay followed disappointment in February, when Nasa was forced to put off the launch of Artemis II after hydrogen was found leaking from its Space Launch System rocket.\n\nArtemis II will send four astronauts on a 10-day journey around the moon, designed to take people further into space than ever before, beyond the record set by Apollo 13 in 1970.\n\nIsaacman said on Friday that additional missions would then be included in the schedule. He likened the extra steps to the approach taken in Nasa’s original moon landing in which Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin first stepped on to the lunar surface in 20 July 1969.\n\nThat legendary event was hazarded only after three separate moon missions had been completed.\n\nThe Artemis III mission will no longer aim to land on the moon. Instead, under the revised plans, it will be launched by mid-2027 as a low-Earth orbit designed to test essential technologies.\n\nThat extra stage is intended to give Nasa extra flight experience with the massively complex advanced systems and the chance to test its space vehicles before it attempts a human moon landing. Should all that go to plan, then a new Artemis IV mission would set out in 2028 to land on the moon.\n\nThe eventual aspiration is to land astronauts near the moon’s south pole. A second moon landing, Artemis V, could be conducted in 2028, followed by a moonshot attempted each year thereafter, Nasa said.",

    "fullText": "The U.S. and Israel launched a major attack on targets across Iran on Saturday.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump urged Iranians to take cover during the strikes, but then said “When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take.” It was an extraordinary appeal that suggested the allies could be seeking to end of the country’s theocracy after decades of tensions.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu echoed that sweeping goal. “Our joint operation will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their fate into their own hands,” Netanyahu said.\n\nIn a video posted on social media, Trump claimed Iran has continued to develop its nuclear program and plans to develop missiles to reach the U.S.\n\nThe first strikes of the attack appeared to target the compound home to Iran’s 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in downtown Tehran. It wasn’t immediately clear if he was there at the time. Smoke could be seen rising from the Iranian capital.\n\nThe attack quickly expanded beyond Iran. Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard said it responded by launching a “first wave” of drones and missiles targeting Israel, where a nationwide warning was issued as the military said it bring down Iranian fire.\n\nSyrian state television says an Iranian missile hit a building in the southern city of Sweida, killing four people.\nThe broadcaster said the missile hit an industrial area in the city, but gave no other details.\n\nVolker Türk expressed regret about the strikes by Israel and the United States, and the “retaliatory” strikes by Iran.\n\n“As always, in any armed conflict, it is civilians who end up paying the ultimate price,” said Türk, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. “Bombs and missiles are not the way to resolve differences but only result in death, destruction and human misery.”\n\nHe called for restraint, de-escalation and a return to the negotiating table.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer chaired a meeting of the government’s emergency committee on Saturday morning and planned to hold calls with allies in the coming hours.\n\n“We do not want to see further escalation into a wider regional conflict”, a U.K. government spokesperson said, reiterating Britain’s support for a negotiated solution to Iran’s nuclear ambitions.\n\nBritain was not involved in the U.S.-Israeli strikes.\n\nThe U.K.'s Foreign Office also updated its travel advice to warn against all travel to Israel and Palestinian territories, and urged British nationals in other Middle Eastern countries to “immediately shelter in place”.\n\nAmerica’s massive use of air power alone against Iran won’t be enough to rid the country of its repressive theocracy unless the U.S. succeeds in persuading the Iranian people and elements of the current government to actively back change, security expert Phillips O’Brien says.\n\nThis is crucial to remember because U.S. President Donald Trump appears to have launched this attack for domestic political reasons and so will not want to risk heavy American casualties by putting troops on the ground to back up the air campaign, said O’Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrew’s in Scotland.\n\nWhile air power can destroy buildings and weaken the current leadership, lasting government change won’t occur without the cooperation of people within Iran who are willing to support Trump’s aim of replacing the current government, O’Brien told The Associated Press.\n\n“What air power can do is attack the present regime, in some cases quite powerfully, but it cannot guarantee it will be replaced or how it will be replaced,” he said.\n\nWe should be able to see within a few days whether support for the ruling theocracy is weakening if Iranian military units start to rebel or members of the regime begin to speak out against the country’s rulers, O’Brien said.\n\nIn northern Tehran, supermarkets are seeing a surge of customers seeking bread and bottled water.\n\nHowever, supply has been limited, and some of the items most in demand, including bread, eggs, bottled water and milk, are currently unavailable in certain stores.\n\nLong queues have also been observed at gas stations across the city.\n\nState television showed footage from one of Tehran’s highways, Soleimani highway, where extremely heavy traffic was visible on west-to-east routes.\n\nQatar says it faced a third wave of Iranian missile fire, which it said it intercepted.\n\nEmirates, one of the world’s biggest long-haul airlines, says several of its flights have been affected by the closure of the airspace in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe carrier is based at Dubai International Airport, the busiest hub for international travel.\n\nIt says it is working with local officials and adjusting its operations, and it urged passengers to check their flight status online.\n\nEmirates transported 53.7 million passengers during its last fiscal year. Many of those passengers, like fellow regional carriers Qatar Airways and Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways, were transiting the region for destinations elsewhere.\n\nKuwait’s national news agency says the Gulf country’s air defenses successfully repelled what it called a “heinous Iranian attack” earlier in the day.\n\nQuoting a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the KUNA news agency said Kuwait maintains its right to defend itself.\n\nKuwait Airways, meanwhile, says it has temporarily suspended flights in and out of the country\n\nThe death toll in an Israeli-U.S. strike on a girls’ school in southern Iran rises to at least 40 people killed, the state-run IRNA news agency reported.\n\nAt least 45 others had been wounded in the attack in Minab in Iran’s Hormozgan province.\n\nIran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard has a base in the city.\n\nNeither the U.S. nor Israel has offered any details on the campaign so far.\n\nPakistan’s Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Saturday condemned what he described as “unwarranted attacks” on Iran during a phone call with his Iranian counterpart Abbas Araghchi.\n\nIt said the two sides discussed the evolving situation in Iran and the wider region.\n\nAccording to the statement, Dar also called for” an immediate halt to escalation through urgent resumption of diplomacy to achieve a peaceful, negotiated resolution to the crisis.”\n\nIranian state media said the U.S.-Israeli attacks targeted a growing list of cities and sites across Iran.\n\nPlumes of smoke could be seen above Tehran due to direct strikes, with reports of explosions in or near the major cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Tabriz.\n\nBlasts were also reported in several western towns as well as around Persian Gulf port cities that are critical to Iran’s major oil trade, including Asaluyeh.\n\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry called the strikes “a pre-planned and unprovoked act of armed aggression against a sovereign and independent UN member state,” demanding an immediate halt to the military campaign and a return to diplomacy.\n\nIn a statement posted to Telegram, the ministry accused Washington and Tel Aviv of “hiding behind” concerns about Iran’s nuclear program while pursuing regime change, warning the attacks risked triggering a “humanitarian, economic, and possibly radiological catastrophe” in the region and accusing the United States and Israel of “plunging the Middle East into an abyss of uncontrolled escalation.”\n\nMoscow called the bombing of nuclear facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards “unacceptable” and said it stood ready to help broker a peaceful resolution, while placing full responsibility for the escalation on the U.S. and Israel.\n\n“The military escalation in the Middle East is igniting a dangerous chain reaction across the region, with potentially devastating consequences for civilians,” ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric said.\n\nSpoljaric said civilian infrastructure, such as schools, homes and hospitals, must be spared from attacks.\n\n“In international armed conflicts, international humanitarian law, in particular all four Geneva Conventions, apply,” she said, referring to a key international guidebook on the rules of war. “Medical personnel and first responders must be allowed to carry out their work safely.”\n\nAP explains sirens ringing out in Israel as the country remains on high alert after launching strikes against Iran.\n\nSaudi Arabia strongly condemned Iranian attacks on the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and Jordan.\n\nThe kingdom warned of “dire consequences of the continued breach of countries’ sovereignty and the violation of international principles.”\n\nSaudi Arabia also called on the international community to take measures to confront Iran’s attacks, which it said were undermining the stability and security of the region.\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons has condemned the U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran.\n\n“These attacks are totally irresponsible and risk provoking further escalation as well as increasing the danger of nuclear proliferation and the use of nuclear weapons,” said its executive director, Melissa Parke. “Military action is not a viable or long-term solution to prevent nuclear proliferation. All military action must stop immediately.”\n\nICAN, as the group is known, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017.\n\nEuropean Union leaders issued a joint statement Saturday, calling for restraint and engaging in regional diplomacy in hopes of “ensuring nuclear safety.”\n\n“Ensuring nuclear safety and preventing any actions that could further escalate tensions or undermine the global non-proliferation regime is of critical importance,” said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa. “We call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint, to protect civilians, and to fully respect international law.”\n\nBoth said that while the 27-nation bloc had pushed for diplomacy to solve critical issues, it had also placed “extensive sanctions in response to the actions of Iran’s murderous regime and the Revolutionary Guards.”\n\nThey said Brussels was working with EU member nations to support their citizens in the Middle East.\n\nKhamenei had not made a public appearance in the days before the attack and hadn’t been immediately seen after.\n\nDuring the 12-day war, he was believed to have been taken to a secure location away from his Tehran compound.\n\nIsrael’s president, Isaac Herzog, welcomed the joint U.S.-Israeli operation against Iran.\n\nHerzog said he hoped the operation “will bring a historic change and a better future for the whole Middle East and the entire world.”\n\nQatar’s Defense Ministry said the military has successfully repelled the second wave of attacks that targeted several parts of the nation.\n\nMeanwhile, the country’s Foreign Ministry condemned the Iranian attacks, calling them a “flagrant violation” of its sovereignty. It added that Qatar has always called for a dialogue with Iran and that targeting the country “cannot be accepted under any justification or pretext” as the gas-rich Gulf nation has always distanced itself from regional conflicts.\n\nA person briefed on the military plans says Saturday’s operation was planned by the U.S. and Israel for months and closely coordinated.\n\nThe person says the attacks are expected to continue for several days.\n\nThey spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter with the media.\n\nIran on Saturday said the U.S.-Israeli airstrikes in southern Iran killed five students at a girls’ school, the first confirmed fatalities in the operation.\n\nThe state-run IRNA news agency reported the strike happened in Minab in the province of Hormozgan.\n\nIran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard has a base in the city.\n\nNeither the U.S. nor Israel has offered any details on the campaign so far.\n\nIran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard says in retaliation against Israel and U.S. attacks on Iran, the military struck several facilities in the region.\n\nThe Revolutionary Guard said in a statement that in the first phase of the operation, named “Truthful Promise 4,” Iran’s military struck the command of the U.S. 5th Fleet in Bahrain, as well as U.S. bases in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates and military targets in Israel. There have been no reports of damage in these areas apart from one death in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIt said Iranian attacks with missiles and drones are continuing and more information will be released later.\n\nQatar Airways says it has temporarily suspended flights at its Doha hub because of the closure of the Gulf nation’s airspace.\n\nThe airline says it is working with local authorities to support passengers affected by the stoppage, and that it expects delays once flights eventually resume. It did not say when that might be.\n\nGovernment-owned Qatar Airways is one of the Middle East’s largest airlines, funneling tens of millions of mostly long-haul passengers through Qatar to destinations on six continents.\n\nSpain’s Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares said that Spain was monitoring the situation and demanded respect for international law.\n\n“Violence only brings chaos. De-escalation and dialogue are the path to peace and stability,” Albares wrote on X.\n\nHe said all of Spain’s embassies in the region were still operational for its citizens.\n\nWithin hours of the joint U.S. and Israeli strike on Iran, Ali Vaez, who directs the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group, warned that the war could likely escalate.\n\nVaez on social media stressed that Iran had been preparing for the conflict and that wider war could break out across the Middle East.\n\nHe also stressed that the war could lead to higher energy costs, which would undercut one of Trump’s domestic political messages that gasoline prices have been lower since his return to the White House.\n\n“Iran sits along the Strait of Hormuz, through which roughly a fifth of the world’s oil supply passes,” Vaez posted. “Even limited disruption could spike energy prices, fuel inflation, and rattle global markets.”\n\nSyria’s civil aviation authority announced the closure of airspace in southern Syria Saturday, while a number of airlines, including Lufthansa, Air France, Transavia, Qatar Airways, and Pegasus canceled all flights to Lebanon.\n\nShrapnel from an Iranian missile attack on the capital of the United Arab Emirates killed one person Saturday, state media said.\n\nThe WAM news agency reported the fatality, the first known in the Iranian counterattack following attacks by the United States and Israel targeting the Islamic Republic.\n\nIsrael’s national rescue service MADA said one man was lightly wounded from an impact in northern Israel.\n\nFire and rescue services said an apartment on the 20th floor of an apartment building suffered a direct hit. It was not clear if it was struck by a missile or debris from an interception.\n\nThe airline’s Senior Vice President of Communications Yahya Ustun wrote on X that flights to Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Jordan will be suspended till March 2nd.\n\nMeanwhile, flights to Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, UAE and Oman will be suspended on Saturday. He added that they were closely monitoring the situation and further cancellations may be announced.\n\nQatar’s Interior Ministry said the missile attack on the country that was aborted did not cause any human losses or material damage.\n\nThe ministry called on citizens and foreigners to stay away from suspicious objects and to report them to the authorities.\n\nThe U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet command, which host nation Bahrain said was targeted by a missile attack, is responsible for securing the shipping lanes around the oil-rich Middle East.\n\nThose waters include the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea and parts of the Indian Ocean. The region contains three key chokepoints: the Suez Canal and the Bab al-Mandeb on either end of the Red Sea, and the Strait of Hormuz between Iran and Oman.\n\nIran has repeatedly threatened to shut the strait if attacked. Iranian-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen have said they will resume attacks on shipping routes and on Israel.\n\nThe extent of the damage to the 5th Fleet headquarters wasn’t immediately clear. The base is located just to the southeast of central Manama, the island nation’s capital.\n\nThe base is located just to the southeast of central Manama, the island nation’s capital.\n\nAmerican ships that are typically docked in Bahrain appeared to be out to sea as recently as Tuesday, according to satellite photos shot Tuesday by Planet Labs PBC and analyzed by The Associated Press.\n\nA drone strike Saturday hit the headquarters of the Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia in Iraq, in the Jurf al-Sakhar area southwest of Baghdad, killing at least two people and wounding four others, two militia officials said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the U.S. or Israel.\n\nBefore Saturday’s strikes on Iran, the group had threatened to join the fray should Iran be attacked.\n\nMeanwhile, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said in a statement that he received a call from his Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araghchi, in which Araghchi said Iran would target U.S. bases in the region out of self-defense.\n\n“He clarified that these attacks were not targeting the countries involved, but were limited to military sites,” the statement said. It added that Hussein urged deescalation.\n\nIraq’s Security Media Cell, affiliated with the country’s security forces later confirmed the strike without identifying what was hit and said that two people were killed and three wounded.\n\nAn Israeli military official said Israel was not aware of any Israeli strikes on Kataib Hezbollah headquarters in Iraq. There was no immediate comment from the U.S.\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim condemned Israeli strikes on Iran and accompanying U.S. military action, warning that the escalating conflict has pushed the Middle East to the “edge of catastrophe.”\n\nAnwar said Israel’s initiation of the strikes was a “vile attempt” to sabotage ongoing negotiations and draw other nations into a broader conflict that could spiral out of control. He called for an “immediate and unconditional cessation of hostilities.”\n\nIn a briefing with reporters, a military official speaking on condition of anonymity under military briefing rules said Israel has identified “a sharp acceleration” in Iran’s missile program.\n\nThe official said Iran was beginning to make dozens of ballistic missiles a month.\n\nThe official also said there had been no significant hits in Israel, speaking just before noon, roughly four hours after the operation began.\n\nFrance, whose military has bases and a regular presence in the Mideast, has called on French citizens in the region to exercise extreme caution.\n\n''A military escalation is underway... It’s not the time for negotiations, we are in a situation of war,’' junior defense minister, Alice Rufo, told France-2 television Saturday, comparing the situation to what happened last June.\n\n''Our priority is the protection of our citizens and protection of our forces in the region,’' she said.\n\nAsked if French forces were involved in the U.S. and Israeli strikes or targeted in retaliatory strikes, French military spokesperson Col. Guillaume Vernet said: ''The French armed forces continuously adapt their posture to threats and implement measures to ensure the surveillance and protection of military installations where French soldiers are deployed.’'\n\n''Our military presence guarantees France’s independent assessment of the situation,’' he told the AP.\n\nIran’s Supreme National Security Council confirmed in a statement the country had begun responding to the joint strikes, saying its armed forces had “commenced a decisive response to these hostile acts.”\n\nThe statement warned Iranians to avoid areas in the zones being targeted and that the government had made “prior arrangements” to ensure supply of basic necessities.\n\nSchools and universities were ordered to close, while the statement said banks would continue to operate.\n\nGermany was informed in advance about Israel’s military strikes on Iran, a spokesman for the German executive said on Saturday, saying the German government is monitoring developments closely and is in close consultation with its European partners.\n\nThe German government’s crisis management team is scheduled to meet today at noon to discuss the situation in Iran. Chancellor Friedrich Merz has already consulted with relevant ministers and will have further talks on Saturday.\n\nGermany also urged its nationals in Iran, Israel, and the wider region to register on the official system for citizens abroad and follow the instructions of local authorities regarding the necessary measures for their own protection.\n\nThe foreign ministry said it was in “close and constant” contact with the embassies in Iran and Israel, as well as other missions in the region.\n\nTwo officials with different Iran-backed militias in Iraq told The Associated Press that a meeting took place two months ago between Iranian officials and allied Iraqi militias to make plans for a response in case Iran was attacked, including distributing tasks among the Iraqi armed groups.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.\n\nOne of the officials said it was decided that the response would target U.S. forces and interests in Iraq’s semi-autonomous northern Kurdish region and in neighboring Jordan.\n\nU.S. troops have vacated bases where they were previously stationed in Iraq in areas under the control of the central government in Baghdad as a result of an agreement to end the military mission in Iraq of an American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State, but they remain in the Kurdish region.\n\nOne of the most prominent Iraqi militias, Kataib Hezbollah, on Thursday issued a public statement urging its fighters to “be prepared to engage in a war of attrition that may be prolonged and exceed the expectations of the U.S. administration.” It also issued a warning to the Kurdish regional government in Iraq “against collaborating with hostile foreign forces” that “could threaten its security and future.”\n\nThe Israeli military issued a warning in Persian for the immediate evacuation of areas near weapons production and military facilities in Iran.\n\n“Your presence in these locations puts your lives at risk,” the military said on its Persian language X account.\n\nIran’s Foreign Ministry responded to the joint strikes Saturday, saying that the country “will not hesitate” in its response to the renewed military aggression.\n\n“The time has come to defend the homeland and confront the enemy’s military assault,” the foreign ministry posted in a statement on X. “Just as we were prepared for negotiations, we have been even more prepared for defense at all times. The armed forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran will decisively respond to the aggressors with full authority.”\n\nQatar’s Defense Ministry says the nation’s military shot down several missiles before they reached its airspace.\n\nThe ministry said the missiles were dealt with as soon as they were detected “in accordance with the pre-approved security plan,” emphasizing that the Qatari Armed Forces possess the full capabilities and resources to protect the country.\n\nIran responded as it had been threatening to do for months — it first launched a wave of missiles and drones targeting Israel. Then, later, it began apparently targeting U.S. military installations in Bahrain, Kuwait, and Qatar, as explosions could be heard.\n\nExplosions could be heard in Qatar on Saturday as Iran launched a counterattack over the joint United States-Israel campaign targeting the Islamic Republic. There was no immediate word if there was any damage.\n\nThe Qatar warning urged people to seek shelter.\n\nWitnesses heard sirens and explosions in Kuwait on Saturday, home to U.S. Army Central.\n\nThere was no immediate word on any damage from the blasts.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates closes its airspace as Israel and U.S. conduct strikes on Iran.\n\nThe disruption will have a major effect on global air travel as the country is home to both the long-haul carriers Emirates and Etihad.\n\nIsrael said the attack against Iran was a “broad, coordinated, and joint operation against the regime” that had been planned for months between the Israeli and U.S. military.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a recorded message released Saturday morning that Israel plans the current operation to be “much more powerful” than the bruising 12-day war Israel launched against Iran in June.\n\nMeanwhile, streets were mostly empty as a series of sirens continued. Israel’s main news programs shifted their broadcasts to bomb shelters as well.",

    "fullText": "New updates and improvements at Cloudflare.\n\nCloudflare's stale-while-revalidate support is now fully asynchronous. Previously, the first request for a stale (expired) asset in cache had to wait for an origin response, after which that visitor received a REVALIDATED or EXPIRED status. Now, the first request after the asset expires triggers revalidation in the background and immediately receives stale content with an UPDATING status. All following requests also receive stale content with an UPDATING status until the origin responds, after which subsequent requests receive fresh content with a HIT status.\n\nstale-while-revalidate is a Cache-Control directive set by your origin server that allows Cloudflare to serve an expired cached asset while a fresh copy is fetched from the origin.\n\nAsynchronous revalidation brings:\n\nThis change is live for all Free, Pro, and Business zones. Approximately 75% of Enterprise zones have been migrated, with the remaining zones rolling out throughout the quarter.\n\nTo use this feature, make sure your origin includes the stale-while-revalidate directive in the Cache-Control header.

    "description": "What happens to our bodies when we become so enmeshed with digital interfaces that they're no longer something we start and stop using, but a persistent presence that we live with?",
    "fullText": "What happens when we become so enmeshed with digital interfaces that they're no longer something we start and stop using, but more a persistent presence that we live with?\nWhat happens when this happens at the level of our bodies and changes how free we feel to move physically?\n\nDigital technologies can be used to transform our intentions, to narrow and focus them and to broaden and mutate them.\nToday we interact with that technology through conventional, designed interfaces.\nThese are built upon layers of intellectual representations of human activity: documents, images, videos, profiles, likes, emojis, code.\nEvery time you use software, you’re invited to represent your thoughts, your intentions, your wildest self, in terms of these structured datatypes that someone has invented and built.\nAs a human, you need to adapt around them.\n\nThere is at least a whiff of neutrality to it all.\nFor example, while the content on social media is personally tailored and distributed according to very secret algorithms, the boxes into which it is formatted are mostly the same for everybody.\nIn our expressive offerings to the algorithm, we all express ourselves through the same uniform interfaces.\n\nBut an artefact of this uniformity may be a kind of mass conformity that we can’t quite see because we’re all partaking in it. Not just a conformity of ideas and ideology but of modes of expression and the importance we give them.\nWe make little videos and we write little messages and we take photos and what doesn’t exist within this documentation can seem as unreal as things we thought but didn’t say aloud.\n\nThe tool grants us power but its way of seeing the world is projected back onto us.\nThrough this bargain, it institutionalises us into thinking its way is the way.\n\nBack in 2011 I was making body-controlled interfaces for music – specifically the homebrew world of motion-capture unlocked by the repurposed Xbox Kinect camera.\n\nThe Kinect unlocked full-body tracking for cheap without attaching things to the body.\nTracking the whole body gave so much expressive potential. You could move freely. You don’t have to hold onto anything.\nIt could give you skeleton tracking, a silhouette or a point cloud of a body.\n\nThis was more data than my brain could design for.\nI could easily code trigger zones, and parameters that go up and down as your hands go faster or slower - but these all see the body as a set of independent labelled particles moving through space. They're about body parts rather than the body as a whole.\nEssentially, my code was reducing the immense dynamic range of the body to these tiny little digital abstractions I just invented.\n\nNow there's nothing intrinsically wrong with this. It's a lot of fun. But there's an interesting subtlety when the whole body is being tracked. If I hand you a button you can put it down. But if I make the touching together of your hands trigger a sound, you can’t escape, unless you leave or hide your hands.\nOne day, rehearsing with Jan-Ming in the studio, she commented that she felt like the system was constraining her movement.\nI was trying to increase expressivity, but in some sense was having the opposite effect. What’s going on here?\n\nThe embodied interface is a selective filter that reduces your expression into an abstract digital representation. But that relationship goes both ways. When our focus moves to the digital output, it’s the digital representation that matters, and the body is now subordinate to the representation. Whatever we do will be interpreted through the limits of that representation.\nInteraction projects the system's representation of the individual back onto them.\nWe start to think through the limited range of this abstraction (abstraction as in: stripping away what we don't need for our model of the world).\n\nI believe all interactive technology has this effect to some extent.\nBut the more we entangle the interaction with our body, the less liberty our body has to move without consequence.\nIt can become a kind of prison. Instead of controlling these respresentations as an extension of our agency, we become limited by their limitations.\nI think this is the fundamental mistake we make with technology: When you can’t escape it, you become institutionalised by it.\n\nIn one sense, the problem is not the interactive system but the fact we’re fixated on its output and losing touch with all the untracked parts of ourself.\n\nJan-Ming and I took the body-to-paintstroke system from the dance work above and used it to create algorithmic portraits of how someone moves. We called this work Movement Alphabet.\n\nOur drawing system extracted endpoints from the body's silhouette using a technique called pixel skeletons. It was glitchy with a real personality of its own. The relationship between movement and image was there, but with so much error and noise.\nYet, in spite of this, we realised that the limiting factor was how someone feels when they’re confronted with a body-controlled interface, and the kinds of unnatural gestures that situation tends to elicit.\nSo we focused less on the digital system and more on constructing a context to support someone in expressing themselves authentically in movement.\n\nWe devised a journey, led blindfolded by a guide whispering in your ear, into a private pod where you’re invited to share significant memories, and then gently assisted to express these through movement.\nThe camera is nestled in a corner and the guide has a little remote control to choose when that movement is transcribed into a portrait.\n\nThe portrait that emerges is a fusion of our glitching algorithms, how the person moved, and when the guide pressed the button.\nThey all look rather similar to each other - definititely a reductive representation. Each is more recognisable as our artwork than the participant they portray. But the participant is shielded from this narrow representation while they move. This removes the feedback loop and lets their mind remain focused on their human self.\n\nWhen the participant emerges from the pod we hand them their printed portrait and a handwritten note of a few words they had mentioned when each one had been taken. They were then led to some cushions to rest for ten minutes.\n\nI found people to be much more attached to their portrait than if they had stood in front of a projector and moved with a feedback loop.\n\nFeedback loops are essential for learning (and pretty much the definition of interaction). But learning can also be toxic, like institutionalisation, like learned helplessness. Today, we have learnt how to express ourselves through little pieces of structured data. For many of us, the pursuit of our goals in life seems to depend upon doing this again and again.\n\nI think AI-mediated interaction will change this. I don’t just mean talking to AI, as many of us are doing today, but bespoke AI-generated interfaces, both visual and embodied. Instead of working with representations designed by a human mind, AI forms its own messy representations statistically from whatever data we set it upon.\n\nSo, can we humans stop needing to think through the abstract realm of the machine, and instead have the machine think through the messy reality of the human?\n\nIn 2021 I explored this idea with artist and AI researcher Panagiotis Tigas in the project Sonified Body. I wanted to create a dance-to-sound system and to use machine learning to escape my previous experiences of trapping the expressive body behind a digital materialisation of my own preconceptions of what a body is, how it moves, and how that might translate into sound.\n\nWe wrote some papers if you’re interested in all the detail, but the summary of it is this:\n\nGiven the 25 joints of the Kinect skeleton representation (in 3D space so that’s 75 numbers), we train a model to find a way to compress these into 16 numbers and then decompress them back into the original skeleton.\nWe trained the system on around 15 hours of recordings of me dancing.\nIn other words, we’re saying: given what you can see in these recordings, find a way of representing this body as accurately as you can in just 16 parameters.\n\nThis is still a process of reduction. But we’re not saying what to reduce the body to or how to reduce it. We’re not saying which parts of the body are more important, nor introducing concepts like ‘upright’ or ‘open’. The representation emerges rather than being designed. It's called a latent representation.\nAnd while 16 degrees of freedom is a fraction of how the body can move, it’s a huge number to be simultaneously jostling with a computer. But it's not something you think about, or can really think about – you just play and get a feel for it.\n\nI hooked these 16 numbers up to a drum kit synth and some off-the-shelf effects. I did this quickly without thinking of musical ideas, aiming to keep the sound a raw and direct rendering of the representation.\nThen we invited dancers in to have a play.\n\nI was very happy with the results.\nFor me, the system offers a kind of openness I haven't managed to achieve through traditional coding.\nI don’t see the dancer get lost in my own ideas of what a body is and what it does.\nIt’s a way of avoiding the bottleneck of designed abstractions, and instead work with representations that are derived directly from the body itself.\nAnd to be clear, we're still using the Kinect skeleton, which is a designed abstraction of the body.\nWe haven’t really escaped the symbolic representation of the body, but we’ve taken a step to disentangle it from how we structure our interaction with the system.\n\nI'd like to hope Sonified Body anticipates a future where AI liberates us from the data-entry mode of being in the world that we suffer from today.\nBut I imagine the intimacy brought by embodied interaction can be used just as readily for harm.\n\nIf we look around today and see a world of bodies contorted around phones, minds contorted by addictive designs, and spirits contorted by algorithmically mediated social lives, then we can at least take solace in reconnecting with the body as a site of truth. Just stop, take a breath, notice how you feel.\nBut as the surveillance infrastructure that we mindlessly continue to expand starts to take a deeper interest in predicting our behaviour from our movements, we may find ourselves institutionalised in body as well as in mind.\n\nAnd yet, for those of us worried about this, I don’t think it helps for us to exclude ourselves from the coming revolution and take refuge in a bubble of moral indignation.\nWe need to build things for ourselves, to own our technologies and our means of expression, and to stay present to what it does to us and those we share it with.\nWe need to have fun with it, and be ready to offer an alternative.\n\nBased on a talk originally presented at Future Folk, Cecil Sharp House, London, 6 Feb 2026.",

    "fullText": "In an early morning video statement, President Donald Trump announced the start of combat operations against Iran. These actions follow weeks of threats, a massive American military buildup in the Middle East, and strained negotiations amid soaring tensions between Washington and Tehran.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump on the United States military combat operations in Iran: pic.twitter.com/LimJmpLkgZ\n\n\"A short time ago, the United States military began major combat operations in Iran.\n\n\"Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime, a vicious group of very hard, terrible people.\n\n\"Its menacing activities directly endanger the United States, our troops, our bases overseas, and our allies throughout the world.\n\n\"For 47 years, the Iranian regime has chanted 'Death to America' and waged an unending campaign of bloodshed and mass murder targeting the United States, our troops, and the innocent people in many, many countries.\n\n\"Among the regime's very first acts was to back a violent takeover of the US Embassy in Tehran, holding dozens of American hostages for 444 days. In 1983, Iran's proxies carried out the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut that killed 241 American military personnel. In 2000, they knew and were probably involved with the attack on the USS Cole. Many died.\n\n\"Iranian forces killed and maimed hundreds of American service members in Iraq. The regime's proxies have continued to launch countless attacks against American forces stationed in the Middle East in recent years, as well as US naval and commercial vessels and international shipping lanes. It's been mass terror, and we're not going to put up with it any longer.\n\n\"From Lebanon to Yemen and Syria to Iraq, the regime has armed, trained, and funded terrorist militias that have soaked the earth with blood and guts, and it was Iran's proxy, Hamas, that launched the monstrous October 7 attacks on Israel, slaughtering more than 1,000 innocent people, including 46 Americans, while taking 12 of our citizens hostage. It was brutal, something like the world has never seen before.\n\n\"Iran is the world's number one state sponsor of terror, and just recently killed tens of thousands of its own citizens on the street as they protested.\n\n\"It has always been the policy of the United States, in particular, my administration, that this terrorist regime can never have a nuclear weapon. I'll say it again. They can never have a nuclear weapon.\n\n\"That is why, in Operation Midnight Hammer last June, we obliterated the regime's nuclear program at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan.\n\n\"After that attack, we warned them never to resume their malicious pursuit of nuclear weapons, and we sought repeatedly to make a deal. We tried. They wanted to do it. They didn't want to do it. Again, they wanted to do it. They didn't want to do it. They didn't know what was happening. They just wanted to practice evil.\n\n\"But Iran refused, just as it has for decades and decades. They rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions, and we can't take it anymore.\n\n\"Instead, they attempted to rebuild their nuclear program and to continue developing long-range missiles that can now threaten our very good friends and allies in Europe, our troops stationed overseas, and could soon reach the American homeland.\n\n\"Just imagine how emboldened this regime would be if they ever had and actually were armed with nuclear weapons as a means to deliver their message.\n\n\"For these reasons, the United States military is undertaking a massive and ongoing operation to prevent this very wicked, radical dictatorship from threatening America and our core national security interests.\n\n\"We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally, again, obliterated.\n\n\"We are going to annihilate their navy. We are going to ensure that the region's terrorist proxies can no longer destabilize the region or the world and attack our forces, and no longer use their IEDs — or roadside bombs, as they are sometimes called — to so gravely wound and kill thousands and thousands of people, including many Americans.\n\n\"And we will ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon. It's a very simple message. They will never have a nuclear weapon.\n\n\"This regime will soon learn that no one should challenge the strength and might of the United States Armed Forces.\n\n\"I built and rebuilt our military in my first administration, and there is no military on earth even close to its power, strength, or sophistication.\n\n\"My administration has taken every possible step to minimize the risk to US personnel in the region. Even so — and I do not make this statement lightly — the Iranian regime seeks to kill.\n\n\"The lives of courageous American heroes may be lost, and we may have casualties. That often happens in war.\n\n\"But we're doing this — not for now — we're doing this for the future, and it is a noble mission.\n\n\"We pray for every service member as they selflessly risk their lives to ensure that Americans and our children will never be threatened by a nuclear-armed Iran.\n\n\"We ask God to protect all of our heroes in harm's way, and we trust that with His help, the men and women of the armed forces will prevail.\n\n\"We have the greatest in the world, and they will prevail.\n\n\"To the members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, the armed forces, and all of the police, I say tonight that you must lay down your weapons and have complete immunity — or, in the alternative, face certain death.\n\n\"So lay down your arms. You will be treated fairly with total immunity, or you will face certain death.\n\n\"Finally, to the great, proud people of Iran, I say tonight that the hour of your freedom is at hand. Stay sheltered. Don't leave your home. It's very dangerous outside. Bombs will be dropping everywhere.\n\n\"When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be, probably, your only chance for generations.\n\n\"For many years, you have asked for America's help, but you never got it. No president was willing to do what I am willing to do tonight.\n\n\"Now you have a president who is giving you what you want, so let's see how you respond.\n\n\"America is backing you with overwhelming strength and devastating force. Now is the time to seize control of your destiny and to unleash the prosperous and glorious future that is close within your reach. This is the moment for action. Do not let it pass.\n\n\"May God bless the brave men and women of America's armed forces. May God bless the United States of America. May God bless you all. Thank you.\"",

    "description": "I visited Rikers jail kitchen, where knives are chained, and cooks work alongside detainees to feed nearly 7,000 detainees 7 million meals a year.",
    "fullText": "Rikers Island, New York City's most notorious jail complex, sits in the water between the Bronx and Queens.\n\nWhen I visited the complex in April 2025, I expected it to be hard to reach — and I wasn't wrong. There's just one small, mile-long bridge for everyone entering and exiting the facility.\n\nNearly 7,000 detainees are in custody at Rikers. In 2024, the city spent $19 billion to feed them all, amounting to 7 million meals. I wanted to learn why the price tag is so high and how the operation works.\n\nHere, chefs — not detainees — do the cooking. When they're on shift, the cooks are locked in, too.\n\nVisiting Rikers shook me more than I expected, and I couldn't help but wonder how the chefs and officers carry it every day.\n\nAfter traversing the mile-long bridge, we passed through three security gates. I was surprised to learn that many chefs rely solely on public transportation to get to work, often traveling two or more hours each way.\n\nOnce inside AMKC, we went through metal detectors. This building hasn't held detainees since 2023. It was an eerie 10-minute walk down the silent, seemingly endless hallways.\n\nPeople in custody wash dishes, push carts, and serve food.\n\nThey can't have any infraction tickets. They must be serving time for nonviolent offenses and be approved by custody management to work here.\n\nThere are no open fires here. They cook chicken in rotisserie ovens.\n\nI was shocked to see how many dishes chefs made from scratch. Tartar sauce started as mayo and pickles. Pepper steak, a favorite among detainees, started as blocks of frozen beef.\n\nWhat surprised me most was that the chefs can't use salt. It's been banned since 2014. Instead, they rely on garlic powder, jerk and taco seasoning, and soup bases for flavor.\n\nDetainees can also use seasoning packets from the commissary ramen.\n\nInside the kitchen, it still felt like a jail. I felt the cameras everywhere.\n\nGuards watched over the detainees and checked every incoming shipment of food for contraband. They frisked down detainees before they entered the kitchen, and again before they left.\n\nKnives are kept on chains for their protection. When a chef needs the knife at a different location, they have to get a guard from the office to come unlock it and move it.\n\nThe chefs told me it felt awkward at first, the chain brushing against their hands, but they eventually got used to it.\n\nStill, they say it can be tricky. I watched one chef wrestle the chain into position before cutting into a large frozen block of beef.\n\nEven things I wouldn't normally consider dangerous — like cans of green beans — are treated as potential threats. Chefs are required to throw them away immediately.\n\nCans go into wagons, and lids go into a caged trash can. Officers told us they have to be cautious about everything. Even small pieces of plastic, wood, and metal can be turned into weapons. That goes for spoons and ladles, too.\n\nWhenever a chef needs a ladle or whisk, they have to get a guard to unlock a box in the office.\n\nI couldn't help but think how tedious that must be. \"It's for security,\" the chefs reminded me.\n\nChef Ageda was cracking jokes and laughing with me. He didn't seem phased by the detainees in the kitchen. He said he can't be friends with the people in custody because he knows why they're here. But he said he treats them all with respect.\n\nIn an email statement to Business Insider, the Department of Corrections said, \"violent incidents that occur in our kitchens are extremely rare.\"\n\nNadine Leach was a chef before serving time at Rikers. She's one of the detainees approved to push food carts to the housing units.\n\nAt the time of filming, Leach earned $1.45 an hour. She's saving money for her grandkids, she told me.\n\nLeach has worked in the kitchen longer than any other person in custody, clocking 56 hours a week by choice, she said. She calls the kitchen her \"sanctuary\" because she doesn't feel like she's in jail while working there.\n\nBut even in her sanctuary, officers pat her down, along with all the other people in custody, before they deliver food to the housing units.\n\nOne moment, Leach is telling me about her grandkids and her goals when she gets out. Then reality sinks in, and she's up against the wall.\n\nShe says she understands the officers are doing their jobs and that she's doing her time. They're living in two different worlds.\n\nA dinner might include grilled chicken or pepper steak, which smelled delicious.\n\nThe day I visited, pasta salad and tuna were on the lunch menu. It didn't look particularly appetizing, but it was way better than I expected. There were multiple veggies, from coleslaw to the beets.\n\nIn 2024, a Department of Corrections representative told the City Council that each meal costs about $9.\n\nIn October 2019, NYC's city council voted to close Rikers for good, citing years of violence and unmanageable conditions. The deadline to cease all jail operations on the island was 2027.\n\nHowever, a 2025 report from the Independent Rikers Commission found that the city likely won't meet that deadline. One criminal justice reporter I spoke to said 2031 was more likely.\n\nObviously, this is jail. I knew it was going to be tough to see life inside Rikers. On one hand, the chef and officers' ease helped me relax. But it was clear — simmering just beneath the surface — that there was a constant readiness for the worst-case scenario.\n\nIt was like this huge elephant in the room. We were laughing with the chefs, talking with Leach about her grandkids — but I never forgot where we were. I could feel the cameras. I could always spot an officer in the corner of my eye.\n\nI left Rikers wondering how chefs and officers return to their normal lives every night. Are they able to shake that alertness?\n\nI left thinking about Leach, and my heart sank. Every second she's watched. Every time she leaves a room, she's patted down.\n\nEven so, she maintains a positive outlook, telling me she plans to open up a restaurant when she gets out. A goal I hope she achieves.",

    "title": "I flew overseas with my 9-month-old for the first time. Knowing airline rules was key.",
    "description": "Flying internationally with a baby was intimidating, but meticulous planning, studying airline rules, and having low expectations made it manageable.",
    "fullText": "Armed with more bags than I care to admit and a lot of patience, my husband and I flew between New York and Zurich with our nine-month-old, Roscoe, on Delta Air Lines in February.\n\nIt was our son's first long-haul trip; we'd applied for his passport when he was just two weeks old. He'd previously flown about four hours to Denver at five months old and slept most of the way, so we were cautiously optimistic.\n\nAside from forgetting his ear protection in the car and slight chaos in Zurich, the trip went more smoothly than expected.\n\nWe got better seats and extra bags, TSA PreCheck made security a breeze in New York, and early family boarding meant we were among the first on the plane.\n\nGoing in with low expectations made it easier not to get frustrated when something went wrong — a mindset that proved helpful in Zurich, where we found ourselves overwhelmed with unusually long security lines and stricter rules.\n\nWe managed to make our plane — barely.\n\nOur baby slept or quietly played for most of both seven-hour flights; he only cried briefly for hunger. Feeding him during takeoff seemed to help with ear pressure, as he didn't make a peep. My husband and I took turns watching him.\n\nWe each got about three hours of rest on the outbound red-eye, and we were exhausted by the time we reached our chalet in Austria, about two hours from Zurich, but it could have been far worse. The daytime return flight was easier.\n\nHere's how the flights went from curb to gate, including what we were allowed to bring beyond our usual carry-ons, how security handled oversized liquids, and how we secured better seats.\n\nI booked the round-trip tickets for about 25,000 points per person, plus $68 in taxes and fees; the cash price was about $600. Two friends were on the same reservation; we were all heading to a college reunion-style ski trip.\n\nI had to separately contact Delta to add our son as an \"infant in arms,\" which cost $17. International lap-infant tickets are typically priced at about 10% of the base fare, plus taxes and fees, and are available only for children under two years old.\n\nBecause I have the Delta SkyMiles Gold credit card, everyone on our reservation received a free checked bag, which would have cost at least $75 each otherwise. That cost-savings mattered, given how much we were carrying between baby gear and ski equipment.\n\nWith a baby, my husband and I were also allowed to bring additional items beyond our standard carry-on and personal item, including a diaper bag, a stroller, and a car seat for the rental car.\n\nBoth the stroller and car seat were gate-checked at no charge and returned to us in the jet bridge after landing. We purchased padded bags for about $60 to protect them in the cargo hold; both were undamaged.\n\nAs first-time parents flying internationally with a baby, we overpacked for peace of mind.\n\nBut to stay within the airline's 50-pound weight limits, we spent more than an hour the night before weighing and rearranging our checked bags — an effort that paid off by avoiding any last-minute reshuffling at the airport.\n\nThe only outbound hiccup was when the kiosks wouldn't let us self-tag our bags. I'm not sure why, but we waited only about 20 minutes to check them with an agent before heading to security.\n\nThere was also no kiosk option in Zurich, and we couldn't check in online — meaning another 30 minutes spent at the desk on the return flight.\n\nAt JFK, I took my son and me through TSA PreCheck with his stroller, car seat, diaper bag, and my luggage, while the other three in our group who don't have the expedited membership went through the regular line.\n\nIt turned out to be the right call. I didn't need to remove liquids, electronics, or my heavy hiking boots, which made managing all the gear far easier. A fellow mom traveling solo helped me load everything onto the belt (thank you, random stranger).\n\nBecause I was carrying more than 3.4 ounces of pre-mixed formula and distilled water, an agent briefly tested the liquids. The process was quick and routine, and I cleared security well before the rest of the group.\n\nWe skipped the lounge and got to the gate early to pack our gate-checked items, change a diaper, and mix bottles before boarding. This made the flight itself easier and allowed us to use early family boarding to the fullest.\n\nThe return home from Zurich wasn't as easy.\n\nWithout TSA PreCheck or a dedicated family security line, we had to juggle multiple bags and baby gear while keeping our son calm, with barely any space in the queue to organize before the scanners. Luckily, our baby's oversized liquids weren't an issue.\n\nWe then cleared passport control and joined another long line to catch a crowded train to the gates. The hourslong obstacles ate into our buffer, leaving us scrambling with arms full of disorganized gear as we raced to make our plane.\n\nIt was easy to feel judged by other travelers, but I reminded myself I was doing the best I could under chaotic circumstances. Even though we arrived the recommended three hours early, I'll budget well beyond that next time.\n\nOn Delta, you can typically request a bassinet on a first-come, first-served basis, but the specific Boeing 767 we flew both legs didn't have one in regular economy.\n\nThe staff did the next best thing: from New York, they moved us from a pair of regular seats to the bulkhead, where we had a row of three seats to ourselves. On the return, the cabin crew offered us a full three-seat row at the back of the plane.\n\nThe extra space made managing a baby on a long flight significantly easier, allowing us to keep supplies within easy reach and give him room to stretch, stand, and burn off energy. Changing him was tricky — the lavatory changing table was small, but we managed.\n\nOverall, the experience exceeded my expectations. Airline staff on both sides of the Atlantic were accommodating, and flight attendants were eager to interact with my baby and make him laugh.\n\nI'd take the trip again — though I know it will only get more complicated once he's walking and talking. For now, I'll take the wins and learn from my mistakes in Zurich.",

    "description": "The US and Israel struck Iran, officials confirmed. The US had built up a large military footprint in and around the Middle East in recent weeks.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump announced early Saturday that the US had begun \"major combat operations in Iran,\" adding that the objective \"is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats\" from the regime.\n\nIn a video statement posted to social media, Trump vowed to destroy Iran's missile program and navy, and ensure that the country can \"never\" have a nuclear weapon. He called on Tehran's forces to surrender or face \"certain death.\"\n\n\"The lives of courageous American heroes may be lost, and we may have casualties. That often happens in war,\" Trump said. \"But we're doing this not for now — we're doing this for the future. And it's a noble mission.\"\n\nThe president also called for Iranian citizens to \"seize control\" in the aftermath of the US operations. \"This will be, probably, your only chance for generations,\" he said in the video statement.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump on the United States military combat operations in Iran: pic.twitter.com/LimJmpLkgZ\n\nThe US strikes on Iran, which were carried out with Israel, followed months of tensions between Tehran and Washington and a massive American military buildup in the region.\n\nThe Israeli government first announced the strikes. Defense Minister Israel Katz called the military action \"preemptive\" and carried out \"to eliminate threats against the country of Israel.\"\n\n\"As a result, a missile and drone attack against Israel and its civilian population is expected in the near future,\" Katz added. The Israeli military has since said it has detected multiple waves of missiles launched from Iran.\n\nA US official confirmed to Business Insider that American land, air, and sea assets were all involved in the strikes, which the Pentagon indicated are part of an operation called \"Epic Fury.\"\n\nFootage circulating on social media appeared to show explosions and plumes of smoke in Iran in broad daylight.\n\nIranian retaliatory strikes targeted US bases across the region. Several countries that host American military installations, including Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, said that they were engaged in air defense. And a US official told Business Insider that American forces were involved in air defense fights as well.\n\nThe attack on Iran marks the second time that the Trump administration has taken direct military action against the country in less than a year. In June 2025, the US bombed the country's nuclear facilities as part of Operation Midnight Hammer, and Trump said at the time these had \"obliterated\" Iran's nuclear sites.\n\nThis new round of strikes comes on the heels of negotiations between the US and Iran, part of the Trump administration's efforts to pressure Tehran into a deal that would severely limit its nuclear and military capabilities. It also follows the withdrawal of Western diplomats from several Middle East countries.\n\nIn recent weeks, as Trump has issued repeated threats and warnings to Iran, pushing it to make a deal, the US has built up a large military footprint in the Middle East and nearby European waters.\n\nThe Pentagon has surged hundreds of fighter jets, aerial refueling tankers, reconnaissance planes, support aircraft, and warships into the region.\n\nOne complicating factor has been public resistance from US allies to operations against Iran. The UK barred the US from using its nearby bases, and Jordan said that its bases couldn't be used for attacks on Iran, despite imagery showing the US has shifted cargo planes and F-35 stealth fighters to one of its bases.\n\nThe significant US naval presence on station or taking up position in the area includes at least two aircraft carriers, more than a dozen guided-missile destroyers, and three littoral combat ships, which are designed for near-shore operations.\n\nThe two aircraft carriers — USS Abraham Lincoln and USS Gerald R. Ford — are each equipped with dozens of embarked fighters, electronic attack jets, early warning planes, and helicopters. The Lincoln's air wing includes F-35 stealth fighters.\n\nOn Friday, a day after the Trump administration's negotiations with Iranian officials in Geneva, White House official Dan Scavino posted a photograph on social media of eight B-2 Spirit stealth bombers on a runway, suggesting these aircraft could be used to strike Iran again.",

Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar is the largest in the Middle East, while Naval Support Activity Bahrain is home to the US Navy's 5th Fleet.

This year, Mamdani sweetened the longtime program.\n\n\"Due to the historic nature of this blizzard, we've increased pay to $30 an hour,\" Mamdani said. \"Grab a shovel, bundle up, and be part of getting our city back in business as you help us clear snow on crosswalks, bus stops, and fire hydrants.\"\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with three residents who answered that call, bundling up and heading to their local sanitation depots. They described sore backs, soaked boots, and — perhaps unexpectedly — a renewed sense of civic pride.\n\nA post shared by Mayor Zohran Kwame Mamdani (@nycmayor)\n\nFor Barbara Leung, a 36-year-old sales operations director who lives in Gramercy, the decision to spend 12 hours shoveling in Chinatown wasn't about the money.\n\n\"I wanted to give back to the community,\" she told Business Insider. \"I see these people every day — and I think of my mom and my relatives. I don't want my mom to have to step into a puddle or slip on ice. It's like, 'Oh, I can make someone else's mom's life better, too.'\"\n\nHer conversations with coworkers were largely tactical — how to chip away at packed corners, how to widen a path for strollers — but they still felt camaraderie.\n\n\"I normally wouldn't meet these people,\" she added. \"I haven't done something like this for a while where I got to interact with a bunch of people, and we all had a common goal.\"\n\nThank you Purple Gatorade Angel 🙏🏼💜🙌🏼 #nyc #snow #snowstorm #blizzard #snowremoval\n\nIn East Harlem, Stephen Bolles, a 33-year-old stand-up comedian who juggles several handyman gigs, said his temporary co-workers were jovial.\n\nOn Monday, he shoveled with a group of about 15 people. By Wednesday, the crew had grown to 25. Neighbors stopped to give thanks, and one man handed his group a large jug of purple Gatorade.\n\n\"The community really came together, especially where I'm at,\" Bolles said. \"It was probably one of the most community-driven things I've done in this neighborhood.\"\n\nCiara Leynes, a 29-year-old former real estate agent in Astoria who is unemployed, said the shoveling appeal was straightforward.\n\n\"I'm unemployed, I'm trying my best to get a job,\" she said. \"People are willing to work — they want to work. You just have to pay them and give them an opportunity.\"\n\nBolles said his roommate first sent him a TikTok about the program when it was advertised at $20 an hour.\n\n\"It's a low-money month for me,\" he said. He signed up that Sunday, filled out paperwork in about 15 minutes, and shoveled on Monday and Wednesday.\n\n\"Anything less than $30 an hour would have been criminal,\" he said. \"This was one of the more brutal upper-body workouts I've ever done for a job.\"\n\nBoth Leynes and Bolles said the cash would help them pay for essentials.\n\nI talked myself into this one ❄️😑🪏 #emergencyshovel #nyc #fyp #blizzard #snow\n\nFor the shovelers in Chinatown, Leung said the quick cash was important.\n\n\"There were folks that really needed the money, and said, 'I can finally have a hot meal and get groceries,'\" she said.\n\nJosh Goodman, the Department of Sanitation's deputy commissioner for public affairs and customer experience, told Business Insider that the city streamlined the program this year to help get the cash out quickly. All shovelers should expect payments within 2 to 6 weeks, depending on when they helped, he said.\n\nMore than 7,000 New Yorkers are now registered as emergency snow shovelers this season — the most ever, Goodman added.\n\nFor some shovelers, the effort doubled as a quiet show of support for the city's new mayor.\n\n\"We were saying, 'Go Mamdani,'\" Bolles joked. \"I kept saying, 'Let's ditch this place and go shovel out Gracie Mansion.'\"\n\nHe also said the program gave him a new respect for the Sanitation Department's work — and that it meaningfully improved pathways compared to recent other snowstorms.\n\n\"The sidewalks are so clear this time around,\" he added. \"They did not make this $30 an hour announcement during the last blizzard, and there is a palpable difference.\"\n\nIn Astoria, Leynes was similarly enthusiastic. \"I'm a fan of Mamdani, I would say,\" she said.\n\nA post shared by Barb Leung (@barbleung)\n\nAll three shovelers said some of the tools left something to be desired.\n\n\"It was easy to break the shovels,\" Leynes said, though she joked that she didn't manage to snap one herself because she wasn't lifting especially heavy loads. \"The guys were doing a lot of the heavy lifting. I tried my best, but I just felt like I was getting in the way.\"\n\nBolles agreed: \"Some of the shovels were not particularly great,\" he said.\n\nGoodman said the department had not received complaints. \"These are the same shovels we have always used,\" he said, adding that officials would be \"happy to look into it.\"\n\nFlimsy plastic aside, the sidewalks in many neighborhoods are now largely passable — carved out by thousands of residents who traded a night of sleep for sore shoulders and a $30 hourly wage.\n\nFor the three who spoke to Business Insider, it was also a chance to feel like the city was theirs to dig out together — one shovel-full of snow at a time.",

    "description": "\"Data Center,\" a new Steam-only game demo, challenges players to manage a data center. Box CEO Aaron Levie jokingly compared it to \"Madden.\"",
    "fullText": "I began my virtual career in the data center industry, standing next to a commercial-sized trash receptacle.\n\nThe room was fluorescent-lit and aggressively gray. A platform trolley sat nearby. There was a lounge area right next to the trash (an interesting touch!), and I had $30,000 in fake money to spend.\n\nThis is how \"Data Center,\" an upcoming PC game by indie developer Václav Novák, introduces players to the fastest-constructing sector in America.\n\nSome Silicon Valley insiders have already discovered the game. On X, Box CEO Aaron Levie called it the tech industry's version of \"Madden,\" the NFL's long-running video game franchise.\n\nOur industry finally has its Madden https://t.co/iMXZ9jTQ3Y\n\nAs a '90s kid who grew up on \"Madden,\" that comparison felt like a challenge: Could I manage the digital infrastructure powering the AI boom?\n\nIf my time playing the game's demo is any indication, I'm not changing my industry anytime soon.\n\nThe goal of \"Data Center\" is straightforward in theory: buy racks, install servers, run cables, configure networking, and connect clients to computing power.\n\nIf everything is wired correctly, experience points climb, reputation rises, and more customers want what you're selling.\n\nI followed the block of yellow text in the left-hand corner of the screen, which told me every step I should take. I also flicked through the pamphlet-like tutorial screen for further (read: much-needed) guidance.\n\nAfter 30-ish minutes of fits and starts, I began shopping for aluminum frames, CAT6E cables, and something called an SFP RJ45. I bought one of each and hoped that counted as a winning strategy.\n\nMy first client, a fictional company called Bermuda Triangle Backup, needed storage and 5,000 IOPS.\n\nUh oh. I did not know what IOPS stood for. I installed servers anyway.\n\nEventually, after several false starts, tangled wiring, and a fair amount of hurriedly dashing across the concrete floor, I connected the company to its machine.\n\nWhite bubbles began flowing along the cables I'd strung between racks, a visual representation of data moving through the system.\n\nFor the first time, I could see \"the cloud.\" My XP climbed past 60.\n\nStill, my reputation remained at zero. That felt like an accurate performance review.\n\nThe game has some growing to do, which Novák readily admits.\n\n\"I have not even finished the game yet,\" he told Business Insider. \"I thought it would be cool to see data flowing in-game. And that is about it.\"\n\nThe full game has a scheduled release date of March 31.\n\nEven in demo form, though, the simulation forces players to grapple with industry basics: racking positions, cable management, network configuration, and storage limits.\n\nIt also uses plenty of industry shorthand. Subnet masks. Gateways. IOPS requirements. Each new client request felt like being handed a technical interview question I hadn't studied for.\n\nIndustry insiders say those details are largely spot on.\n\n\"It nails the tactile basics,\" Nik Kale, a principal engineer and platform architect at Cisco, told Business Insider after playing. \"A real data center isn't a Lego set — it's a living city where power, cooling, and change control are the laws of physics, and every 'small tweak' has a blast radius.\"\n\nThe game, however, stops short of simulating the true stress of operating one.\n\n\"There's no moment where the cooling system hits capacity at 2 a.m., and you're choosing which workloads to shed,\" Kale said. \"There's no change-control board telling you that your 'quick fix' needs three approvals and a maintenance window.\"\n\n(Novák, maybe there's still time to add that gameplay element ahead of the game's full release.)\n\nIs \"Data Center\" the \"Madden\" of infrastructure?\n\nThere's no hit stick, no Franchise Mode, and not a lot of space for viral videos à la Greg Jennings running on a broken leg for a 99-yard touchdown to secure a 49 to 20 victory.\n\nBut after a few hours managing my own fluorescent-lit server room, I understand why the comparison resonates.\n\n\"Madden\" taught a generation of fans how football strategy works — formations, clock management, roster adjustments, defensive schemes, etc.\n\n\"Data Center\" does something similar for the behind-the-scenes machinery that runs the internet and AI chatbots. It turns abstract ideas of digital storage and connectivity into physical decisions about racks, wires, and floor space.\n\nI didn't build an empire. My reputation never pushed past zero. I won't be pivoting careers.\n\nI also learned a thing or two about how complicated these faceless buildings are to run. With American data centers growing in popularity, that feels like table-stakes knowledge for the future.",

    "description": "Société Générale's Albert Edwards warns we're already seeing AI disruptions in the labor market. He thinks consumer spending is about to hit a wall.",
    "fullText": "Citrini Research made waves in markets this week with a hypothetical thought experiment about how AI could dramatically disrupt the job market in just a couple of years. It was the stuff of dreams for permabears like Société Générale's Albert Edwards.\n\nThe famed strategist, who called the dot-com bubble and regularly reminds investors of the bear case in markets, naturally had thoughts on the dystopian report, saying in a February 25 note to clients that he agrees AI will lead to bumps in the road for the labor market.\n\nBut he also took it a step further: he's already seeing evidence that such a scenario is starting to play out, he said.\n\n\"Macroeconomic doomsday scenarios foretelling what might happen by (a distant) 2028 are gaining attention. But we might not have to wait until then,\" Edwards wrote in a February 25 client note. \"The adverse effects on jobs are already plain to see and consumption, in aggregate, is heading for a brick wall as a result.\"\n\nEdwards shared a couple of compelling charts that he argues illustrate the impact of AI on the workforce already.\n\nThe first lines up GDP growth with year-over-year job growth. While GDP has settled into a fairly strong growth rate after coming down from its 2021 highs, job growth has only continued to cool. Edwards said that it's \"blindingly obvious\" that this can be attributed to AI replacing jobs.\n\nThe chart is reminiscent of what investors last year started calling \"the scariest chart in the world\" — where job openings continued to fall while the S&P 500 ripped to record highs. Investors continued to celebrate AI's power while largely shrugging off predictions of negative economic impacts.\n\nEdwards' second chart implies that we may be about to see those impacts. It shows incomes flatlining over the last few years as AI increasingly competes with workers in the labor market.\n\nCuriously, consumer spending has continued to increase, despite the two statistics' historical tendency to move in lockstep. Edwards cited a falling savings rate as an explanation, saying consumers are dipping deeper into their wallets to meet their spending needs and habits.\n\nIndeed, the savings rate has fallen to 3.6%, one of the lowest levels since 2006, when consumers were optimistic about the economy amid a red-hot housing market, he said.\n\nThat, he warned, puts the economy in a precarious position, as he doubts consumers will keep saving less and less. If the savings rate remains unchanged from here, consumer spending will begin to stagnate, Edwards said.\n\n\"In my opinion, unlike in the late 1990s, if you think the US household SR has recently collapsed to 3½% because households 'anticipate higher future income growth', then you need to think again,\" he wrote, with \"SR\" referring to the savings rate.\n\nHe added: \"I believe the recent SR slump is a short-term reaction to real incomes hitting a brick wall and the SR will soon either stop falling — in which case consumption growth will be zero — or rise on a precautionary basis which would cause overall consumption to fall.\"",

    "title": "There's a new US Army office 'getting in the dirt' with soldiers and trying to quickly turn their ideas into real battlefield tech",
    "description": "The new office wants to speed up the development of new ideas, increases the competition for businesses, and keeps soldiers involved throughout.",
    "fullText": "The US Army is trying to develop weapons and technologies faster by testing early and often, gathering repeated soldier feedback, and widening the pool of companies it works with.\n\nThe Pathway for Innovation and Technology office, about 100 days old, is designed to bridge the gap between invention happening across the service and the money and authority to turn ideas into real programs of record.\n\nOn the Army website for the office, it says that \"the Army can't afford to wait. SPEED IS KING!\" Indeed, the speed at which weapons technology is evolving in conflicts like the ongoing war in Ukraine has driven a growing interest in revamping the way the military buys weapons and how it makes sure it's relevant for troops.\n\nPIT, the site says, is aimed at speeding things up by \"getting in the dirt with the Soldier.\"\n\nChris Manning, deputy assistant secretary of the Army for research and technology, said there are two principles that guided the establishment of PIT.\n\n\"Number one is speed takes priority over perfection. We can iterate to get to operational capability,\" he told reporters earlier this month.\n\nAnd the second, he continued, \"is that early soldier feedback is critical in order to make sure we're getting the right technology for the future fight, and then we want to be able to prove the demand signal before we spend big dollars on programs.\"\n\nUntil now, structural problems siloed different efforts to build new weapons and technologies quickly.\n\nBureaucracy, officials said, has long slowed down progress, and the Army has often spent a lot of time thinking about how it would use a new technology and detailing specifications for a program before even building it.\n\nCreating PIT, the office's director Col. Shermoan Daiyaan said, helps formally cut the red tape.\n\n\"What we've had is unit-driven innovation. We've had lab-driven innovation with PMs [program managers] and PAEs [program acquisition executives]. But in this case, the gloves are off, and we can inject that capability,\" he said.\n\nThe goal is to connect those fragmented efforts and give promising ideas a clearer path to funding and fielding.\n\nThe office intends to work across the Army with soldiers who come up with new ideas or feedback on new systems, non-traditional companies and startups that aren't established in the defense industrial base, other Army organizations that want faster solutions, and larger Department of Defense acquisition leaders.\n\nPIT now establishes a pipeline for other Army hubs or labs that didn't necessarily have a path for scaling new ideas, Manning said. The office doesn't have an exact number of potential programs and problems it's looking into, but officials said the list runs into the hundreds.\n\nOne example might be figuring out a common charger for different types of uncrewed aerial systems from various vendors. PIT's heard from soldiers that power generation and integration are major problems, Daiyaan said, and an ideal solution would be having \"one charger to charge them all.\"\n\nThat relatively small fix, officials argue, can have outsized operational impact by reducing the logistical burden on units that increasingly rely on a mix of commercial drones.\n\nThe ideal PIT program development cycle would be a shorter, more competitive process than with traditional weapons. Various companies would be brought in to work on solving an Army problem. A number would be selected for funding, and then those vendors would get their prototypes into the field with soldiers for 30 to 45 days of testing.\n\nAfterwards, the successful applications would get contracts for further development. Then, alongside PIT partners like the Army's FUZE program, officials could buy systems in rounds and gather more information on what works and what doesn't.\n\n\"Maybe we started with five, the next round was 20, and now we may buy 100 to really be getting all that data,\" Daiyaan said. \"All of that, maybe a year from now, we have moved the needle faster than we ever could, because we would have still been studying the problem\" under the Army's old acquisition model.\n\nPIT does not replace the traditional acquisition system, which is still required for large, complex weapons platforms. Instead, it accelerates smaller-scale technologies and urgent capability gaps.\n\nThe major changes to how the Army develops and acquires new weapons are intended to speed up the process, focus less on specific requirements, and better incorporate feedback from soldiers. Over the past year, the service has undergone a shift that officials have said is designed to focus more on what capabilities soldiers want and believe would be most useful for future warfare.\n\nArmy and broader DoD leadership are increasingly focused on using commercial solutions where possible, such as drones, as well as on technologies that can be upgraded or modified based on mission sets.\n\nOne of the most recent examples is the first phase of the Drone Dominance Program, which invited 25 defense companies to bring their drones to Fort Benning, Georgia, for testing with soldiers. From there, the Pentagon will decide which ones to buy at scale.\n\nThese efforts reflect a broader push inside the armed forces to shorten the time between experimentation and procurement, key as rapid battlefield innovation in places like Ukraine has exposed how quickly technology can evolve.",

    "description": "Independent watch brands like F.P. Journe and Greubel Forsey attract wealthy collectors, including Mark Zuckerberg and Jay-Z.",
    "fullText": "Big watch names are sure to catch the attention of the masses, but several smaller brands are reserved for those in the know.\n\nPieces made by independent watchmakers can retail on the high end of six figures. Some have skyrocketed in resale price, making them highly coveted in the watch world. For example, a Rexhep Rexhepi, which can retail for around $60,000, sold at auction for nearly $900,000 less than 10 years after it was made.\n\nWhile leading Swiss brands like Rolex still dominate the luxury watch market, indie brands are becoming more appealing to some higher-end collectors, SwissWatchExpo CEO Eugene Tutunikov told Business Insider.\n\nThese smaller brands have found fans among famous (and wealthy) watch collectors, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, rapper and mogul Jay-Z, and \"Shark Tank\" investor Kevin O'Leary.\n\n\"The independent brands are capturing outsized attention right now because they represent true, physical scarcity in an increasingly mass-produced world,\" Tutunikov said.\n\nThe resale market for indie watches can be especially competitive. Some brands are instantly snapped up once they become available because they're produced in limited quantities, making it rare for collectors to put them up for sale.\n\nThese are the independent watchmakers that collectors and dealers can't stop talking about, according to dealers.\n\nGreubel Forsey was founded in 2004 by Robert Greubel and Stephen Forsey. Wind described its complicated watches as \"unbelievably expensive\" and large.\n\nThe watches are also hard to come by. The brand's chief executive, Antonio Calce, revealed a 10-year plan in 2021 that included kicking production up from just 100 timepieces a year to 400 to 500, he told The New York Times in 2023.\n\nZuckerberg previously flexed his Nano Foudroyante, Greubel Forsey's 10th \"fundamental invention,\" which was limited to 22 timepieces at launch. The retail price is around $585,000, according to watch collector blogs.\n\nUnlike brands like Rolex, Wind said Greubel Forsey watches are more for collecting than flipping for a higher price. However, he said that hasn't stopped them from catching the eyes of finance bros and anyone else who has the cash to spend on a six-figure watch.\n\nRexhep Rexhepi, 39, is often regarded as a prodigy in Swiss watchmaking. He founded Akrivia in Geneva in 2012 before launching his eponymous line in 2018.\n\nRexhepi is known for the minimalist design of his Chronomètre Contemporain watch, which sold at a 2023 auction for nearly $900,000.\n\nHe's amassed a following over the years that Wind said makes it nearly impossible to get a watch from him. That hasn't stopped avid collectors with deep pockets from trying, even as they face competitive auctions and years-long waitlists.\n\n\"The collectors we see jumping into this space already respect the big houses, but they are turning to independents for that hit of pure, unfiltered horological rebellion,\" Tutunikov said.",

    "description": "California billionaires like Larry Page are flocking to South Florida and its tax benefits, in turn, inflating home prices for luxury real estate.",
    "fullText": "Saddy Abaunza Delgado has sold luxury real estate in South Florida for over three decades, typically to doctors or family business owners ready to spend as much as $8 million on a home in the Miami area.\n\nAlmost overnight, that's changed. Her phones are ringing with billionaires — titans of tech and finance — looking to drop nine figures on waterfront properties.\n\n\"I got a flurry of requests and inquiries,\" Delgado, who has landed two billionaire clients recently, told Business Insider. \"I had a lot of Zoom calls with people coming in January after the holidays.\"\n\nWhile the Florida migration among everyday people may have cooled following a pandemic-era boom, billionaires are fueling a spree of massive purchases. They are largely looking to avoid a proposed California wealth tax, which Delgado said led to the busiest January she's ever experienced. She's not the only one; three other agents told Business Insider that inquiries picked up at the end of 2025 and continued into 2026.\n\nGoogle cofounder Larry Page dropped nine figures on properties in the 305 over the past few months, sparking a series of news articles about who might follow. His cofounder, Sergey Brin, is reportedly close to closing on a $50 million property, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly looking in the area.\n\n\"The Californians were never really a target market for us,\" Delgado said. \"California's a beautiful state, but now, because of all the political situations and all the tax laws, it's just coming in our favor.\"\n\nFlorida's billionaire population is growing. The state had 123 as of the start of the year, up from 110 in January 2025, according to Forbes data compiled by Americans for Tax Fairness.\n\nCalifornia's billionaires aren't the only ones taking an interest. With Palantir planning to move its HQ from Denver to Miami, CEO Alex Karp may soon be putting down roots.\n\nPeople moving to Florida for tax reasons is nothing new. The state — which has a 0% income tax, including capital gains, and limited business regulation — has seen waves of ultrawealthy migration.\n\nDuring the pandemic and shortly after, Miami boomed, attracting people from the northeast and Chicago who were drawn by lax COVID-19 restrictions and lower taxes.\n\nBig names from the world of finance, like Citadel's Ken Griffin and Thoma Bravo, moved themselves, and then their companies, to the city. Crypto firms flocked to take advantage of Florida's friendly policies — FTX, pre-fall, made a grand entrance by buying the naming rights to the local arena — and many big-name VCs ensured they had at least one partner on the ground to make deals.\n\nThe proposed billionaire tax is helping propel the latest wave.\n\nAt the end of last year, some billionaires began cutting ties with California ahead of a proposed Billionaire Tax Act deadline, which would impose a one-time 5% tax on California residents worth over $1 billion, including those who moved after January 1. The proposal hasn't yet garnered enough support to make the November ballot, but that doesn't mean rich residents haven't threatened to leave the state.\n\nPage spent over $180 million on three properties in Coconut Grove. Brin looks set to follow, with outlets including the New York Post reporting he's in talks to buy a $50 million waterfront property on Allison Island. Zuckerberg, too, is looking to make a deal on billionaire bunker Indian Creek, as The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nRepresentatives for Page and Brin did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment on Zuckerberg's potential move to South Florida earlier in February.\n\nFinance set the table, now it's tech's turn to eat — and their meals are the most expensive yet.\n\n\"Before, having a $20 million or $30 million sale was an outlier,\" Ana Teresa Rodriguez of Coldwell Banker Realty told Business Insider. \"You needed to be very lucky to sell that.\"\n\nData from Miami real estate research firm Analytics Miami shows that in 2018, one single-family home over $30 million sold in Miami-Dade County. In 2025, 19 homes priced over $30 million sold — a 1,800% increase.\n\nEmpty lots are even selling for $100 million, a price point unheard of in Miami before 2020, according to Analytics Miami.\n\nWater frontage has become the ultimate target for the ultrawealthy, and since there isn't that much of it, it's going for whatever someone is willing to pay.\n\n\"The prime single-family waterfront areas, like Star Island, Indian Creek, and the Venetian Islands, all those places, that's prime scarcity,\" Analytics Miami founder Ana Bozovic told Business Insider. \"The influx of billionaires from California,\" she said, will likely add to the \"escalation of the market.\"\n\nBillionaires are famously high-maintenance, and attracting them is no small feat.\n\nDouglas Elliman agent Dina Goldentayer said that the latest crop of Miami movers — coming from an already sunny state — aren't just fascinated by the sun rays and glamour of South Florida.\n\n\"Miami has never been as sophisticated and as diverse as it is in 2026, and the level of wealth moving here is making Miami level up,\" Goldentayer told Business Insider.\n\nThough the number of billionaires arriving in Miami enclaves is small relative to those neighborhoods' total populations, their wealth is not. A dozen billionaires can have an outsize influence on a local economy.\n\n\"Wealthy people like to have access to really good financial advice; they want to have access to good legal advice,\" Liam Bailey, the global head of research at Knight Frank, told Business Insider.\n\nTo attract that infrastructure, Billionaire Florida transplants Griffin and Stephen Ross put a combined $10 million toward a new effort to bring talent and companies to Florida's \"Gold Coast,\" the stretch from Miami to Palm Beach.\n\nTheir push, called \"Ambition Accelerated,\" aims to attract tech and business sectors by working with founders, CEOs, and investors, CEO Mike Simas of the Florida Council of 100, which is running the initiative, told Business Insider. He pointed to the region's expanding educational and healthcare options, such as new private schools and a Cleveland Clinic branch in West Palm Beach, as key selling points.\n\nAnd of course, money — from tax savings to utility costs — is a big part of the pitch.\n\n\"You've got a partner in government for your growth rather than a government that's trying to cap that success with regulation or tax, or other burdens,\" Simas said.\n\nTo be sure, Miami has been trying to make Miami happen for quite some time — and it's a long way from becoming the next Wall Street or Silicon Valley.\n\n\"Even if compared to the size of the financial cluster in New York, it's tiny, and the tech cluster in California, it's tiny. What's going on at the moment, in Miami, is embryonic,\" Bailey said. \"Over time, if you get enough of this kind of activity, you are basically constantly enhancing the depth of talent pool and the depth of opportunities.\"\n\nAfter all, a tanned and McMansion-filled Rome wasn't built in a day.",

    "title": "A woman accidentally gained 20 pounds taking diet advice from influencers. She learned 3 lessons about sustainable weight loss.",
    "description": "Hailey Groski couldn't understand why she gained weight despite following a nutritious, fitness-influencer approved diet. She learned not to outsource her food choices.",
    "fullText": "After spending a year following nutrition advice from fitness influencers on social media, Hailey Groski realized she had unintentionally gained 20 pounds.\n\nAs a sophomore studying nutrition in 2016, she followed the trends of the time and would eat a big bowl of oatmeal with a big dollop of peanut butter in her dorm room for breakfast, a salad with half a cup of hummus for lunch, and snack on an acai bowl topped with honey and granola.\n\nFollowing the influencers' advice blindly meant she was unknowingly eating hundreds more calories than she needed each day.\n\n\"I was shook because I was doing everything that we were told was right to do for weight loss, and I was exercising a lot too,\" Groski, 28, who is a dietitian based in LA, told Business Insider. Her diet was \"healthy, but it was very calorie-dense,\" she said.\n\nGroski exercised \n\n\"I was training every single day, and I still couldn't lose the weight,\" she said. (Exercise has many benefits, but isn't the shortcut to fat loss that many believe it to be).\n\nWhen Groski followed influencers' advice to lose the weight, she was left feeling hungry and unsatisfied.\n\nIt was only when she \"dialled into her nutrition\" that she started to see results and was able to shed the 20 pounds. \"The big unlock for me was not just eating healthy foods but eating healthy foods for weight loss, and that supported my goals,\" she said.\n\n\"The big shift for me there was really learning not to outsource what my food and nutrition choices were to social media,\" she said.\n\nNine years later, Groski is able to maintain her weight without overdoing it in the gym or following a restrictive diet. She shared the three biggest lessons she learned about sustainable weight loss.\n\nTo lose weight, you need to be in a calorie deficit, where the body uses more calories than it consumes. But the number of calories a person needs depends on several factors, including their height, weight, and lifestyle.\n\nAt first, Groski ate very small portions, which felt overly restrictive. \"I wasn't doing it based on my own calorie needs, I was doing it based on a generic recommendation from someone on social media,\" she said. Likewise, she ate the amount of protein as an influencer said she should, without knowing her specific needs, and still felt hungry.\n\nGroski lost weight, but the process was unpleasant and her habits didn't feel sustainable.\n\nThat's when she started listening to her hunger cues and learning about calories.\n\nHealth experts recommend those who have struggled with disordered eating to be mindful of tracking calories becoming an obsession. But tracking her calories in an app for a short period of time taught Groski which foods were higher in calories than she realized, such as peanut butter, and helped her stay within a calorie deficit.\n\nAfter a few weeks, she had learned what, say, 300 calories of chicken looked like, and she no longer needed to keep tabs on her calorie intake.\n\n\"It's a great tool to educate yourself on calories, protein, fiber, different things like that,\" she said. \"It's a vehicle for education, awareness, and accountability. But you want to have those habits ingrained in you, that education ingrained in you, and then you can eyeball portions.\"\n\nGroski calculated how many calories her body needed to be in a gentle deficit. Once she lost the weight, she calculated how many calories she would need to maintain it and adjusted her diet accordingly.\n\nAfter trying and failing to maintain a rigid workout schedule and a restrictive diet for weight loss, Groski learned that the key to maintaining her weight was creating sustainable habits that she would stick to long-term.\n\nThis looked like a gentle calorie deficit when needed, exercising to feel good rather than look a certain way, and refusing to cut out any foods.\n\nProgress was inevitably slower than when she was going to extremes, but it meant she was enjoying life rather than white-knuckling her way through her weight loss journey.\n\n\"I think it's really important to bring that self-love throughout the entire process rather than being harsh on ourselves,\" she said, \"love yourself in motion, whether you have achieved your goal weight or not.\"",

Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar have closed their airspaces.\n\nSome Middle Eastern airlines, such as Qatar Airways and Emirates, operate major hubs that connect passengers to destinations around the world. Dubai is home to the world's busiest airport for international traffic, while Doha's is the 10th busiest.\n\nEven for flights that don't land there, it's a key route for flying between Europe and Asia.\n\nSome flights appeared to re-route over Saudi Arabia. Other airlines were avoiding the region altogether.\n\nAirspace clearing after strikes by the United States and Israel in Iran. pic.twitter.com/Oub4T6SrkF\n\nIn a post on X, Emirates said it was temporarily suspending all flights to and from Dubai, its home base. That's equal to about 500 flights a day, according to data from Cirium, an aviation analytics firm.\n\nEmirates urged customers to check their flight statuses before visiting the airport. \"We are actively monitoring the situation and engaging with relevant authorities,\" the airline added.\n\nQatar Airways also said all flights to and from its Doha hub were temporarily suspended. \"Once usual operations resume, we anticipate delays to our flight schedule,\" it added.\n\nAir India said it had suspended all flights to the Middle East \"in view of the developing situation,\" and Saudia said \"a number\" of its flights had been canceled too.\n\nFor those already in the air during the strikes, many flights diverted to other nearby airports or turned back to their origins.\n\nAn American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Doha had flown for more than six hours when it turned around over Ireland and started heading back across the Atlantic Ocean, flight-tracking data showed.\n\nIt looks like the total flight-to-nowhere will last about 13 hours.\n\nAn Air Canada flight from Toronto to Dubai was over the Mediterranean Sea before U-turning. Passengers appear to face a total journey time of 10 hours.\n\nThere is likely more disruption to emerge, too. When Iran launched strikes on a US air base in Qatar last June, more than 160 flights were diverted.\n\nIn a video statement posted to Truth Social on Saturday morning, President Donald Trump vowed to destroy Iran's missile program and navy, and ensure that the country can \"never\" have a nuclear weapon.",

The opening states that the VP will advise Disney's HR leaders and senior executives across business units on talent strategy to support \"the next generation of creativity and innovation.\"\n\nThe annual salary range for the position is between $284,900 to $348,100, with eligibility for a bonus and other long-term incentives, the listing says.\n\n\"Your role is crucial in defining and refining the company's multi-year 'Workforce of the Future' strategy, shaping the vision for talent attraction, development, and retention amid changing business models and emerging technologies,\" the company wrote in the post.\n\nThe role requires over a decade of experience in management consulting, strategic HR, or workforce strategy, according to the listing. The post said that experience in top-tier consulting firms like Bain, McKinsey, and BCG is \"strongly preferred,\" and experience with media, entertainment, or tech is a plus. The posting also calls for a bachelor's degree in business, economics, or HR, and preferably a Master's degree.\n\nThe VP will make recommendations on future skill needs and help optimize workforce planning and structure, the listing says.\n\n\"The ideal candidate will combine data fluency, consulting rigor, and human capital expertise to influence leaders and mobilize teams toward measurable, future-focused outcomes,\" the company wrote in the post.\n\nThe opening comes at a time when many companies are racing to figure out what the future of their workforces will look like as AI reshapes industries.\n\nThe World Economic Forum's 2026 Global Risks Report estimates that 86% of companies worldwide expect AI to transform their business models by 2030, and that 92 million workers could be displaced by then.\n\nIn the same timeframe, the report anticipates the creation of 170 million new roles — and some of those have already started to show up.

    "description": "As AI fears rattle tech stocks, Business Insider spoke with three Wall Street veterans to see where they think the pain is headed next.",
    "fullText": "AI hype has soured as investors worry about the disruptive impact the technology could have on businesses and the economy, and it's got the market on edge about where the panic could crop up next.\n\nThe tech sector has been hit the hardest. The software sell-off sparked by recent updates from Anthropic and worries about a labor-market disaster scenario presented by Citrini have only added fuel to the fire. Even Nvidia earnings couldn't shake investors out of their AI fear funk.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with three investing professionals to assess the question weighing on investors minds: What's next for the AI trade?\n\n\"It's kind of amazing to me how violent the sell off has been,\" John Belton, a Gabelli portfolio manager focused on growth names, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Everybody's just kind of walking on the tightrope, waiting for the shoe to drop,\" Futurum CEO and principal analyst Daniel Newman said.\n\nFreedom Capital Markets' head of tech research, Paul Meeks, who has more than 30 years of investing experience, said he went from expecting tech outperformance in 2026 to expecting the sector to lag the broader S&P 500.\n\nHere are four big takeaways from top investing experts.\n\nThe private credit space has caught investors' attention, and Newman said he thinks there is reason to worry.\n\n\"I still think there's a bit of a death bomb in private credit,\" the analyst said.\n\n\"We've seen it with Oracle, where there's just concern about how they're going to continue to raise capital to their capex,\" he added, noting that the private debt could cause a near-term slowdown.\n\nConcerns about private credit were reignited by headlines around Blue Owl Capital, with economist Mohamed El-Erian and JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon stating that they thought the headlines reports swirling around the firm were reminiscent of 2007, just before Great Financial Crisis.\n\nWorries about Blue Owl have compounded other anxieties in the market as software gets hammered and concerns arise in the data center space.\n\n\"There's going to be continued controversy about AI will never make any money,\" Paul Meeks said, explaining he expects pressure on lenders funding AI buildouts will continue.\n\n\"The reason that they get the business is some of these guys can't get money from a bank,\" the analyst said of the private lending market.\n\nInvestors have zeroed in on Blue Owl and other firms' exposure to AI, but big banks aren't immune to the problems, sources said.\n\nBig financial institutions have also gorged on private credit in recent years, syndicating debt in the leveraged loan market and facilitating financing via CLOs.\n\nMeeks signaled that banks could be especially vulnerable to investorss worries, with comparisons to 2007 signaling moutning stress.\n\nBeyond private credit, banks are also at risk of AI disruption themselves.\n\n\"Maybe banks are just a broader candidate for disruption that hasn't really been built in yet. I mean, banks are exposed to the labor market, not so much like a new AI company creating a bank, but there's indirect exposure if the labor market turns,\" Belton added.\n\nHe indicated that the market may not be pricing in the banking space's exposure to AI on multiple fronts, noting that the current environment has been \"very favorable\" to banks, leading stock valuations to become stretched.\n\nPhysical AI, meaning AI systems that interact in the physical world like automated machinery or self-driving cars, is expected to be a significant frontier for technology.\n\nCiti projects the total addressable market for warehouse-automation systems alone will grow to $112 billion by 2029. The analysts say that automated guided vehicles and autonomous mobile robots present significant use cases for physical AI.\n\nPaul Meeks expects opportunities around physical AI to be \"fast and furious.\" It presents a big opportunity for companies that successfully adopt it and a \"super threat\" to those who don't, he said.\n\nThe analyst flagged the industrials and transport sectors as areas of the stock market that could be disrupted by innovation in physical AI.\n\nAs investors have moved out of tech, it has accelerated an ongoing market rotation into cyclical plays. This rotation could leave investors more exposed to physical AI disruption within industrials.\n\nBelton suggested the current preference for cyclical plays like consumer staples and industrials could end up backfiring, and saif that some stocks are being perceived as \"immune to AI,\" stretching their valuations.\n\nIt's creating a \"vulnerable pocket of the market\" if AI does fuel major economic disruption.\n\nSoftware has been one of the hardest-hit areas during the recent tech sell-off. Newman expects that the sub-sector will bounce back, but it won't be an even recovery.\n\nHe thinks that application software companies that went public during the SaaS craze and are focused on specific features are likely to be consolidated into a larger platform or eliminated entirely. He named Expensify and Monday as examples.\n\nNewman sees software names without a data moat, not part of a larger platform, or otherwise exposed to agentic AI replacement, at risk of further declines before sentiment bounces back.",

    "title": "We're a couple in our 30s who dreamed of building a tiny home. My parents had concerns, so we made a pitch deck to convince them.",
    "description": "A couple who wanted to live in a Minitopia tiny home village gave a Powerpoint presentation to convince family it was a good investment.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Anne Leijdekkers, 32, a Dutch arts entrepreneur, and Simone Solazzo, 31, an Italian who used to work in tech. Last year, the couple moved into the house they built in the tiny-home village of Minitopia in Valkenswaard, the Netherlands. This piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAnne: At first, my parents were sceptical about our plan to build our own tiny home.\n\nFriends will always stand behind you, but family members can be more critical. It was important for us to have them on board.\n\nSimone used to work in the corporate world and loves PowerPoint presentations, so on Christmas Day in 2024, we used one to pitch our dream to my family.\n\nSimone: I liked the idea of being able to explain to them why we wanted to do this and what we were planning. The first slide said, in Dutch, \"We are building our home. We'd like your support.\"\n\nIn the presentation, we told them about the plan, the timeline, and where we would be living. We included our budget, which ranged from 40,000 to 80,000 euros ($47,000 to $94,000).\n\nMostly, the slides outlined our motivations. The first reason was to be financially autonomous.\n\nIf we were to buy a big house, we'd be committing to a big mortgage. Instead, we used our savings to pay for the construction of the tiny home, and its transportation to the Minitopia site in Valkenswaard. In total, the project cost us 75,000 euros.\n\nWe don't have a mortgage, and our monthly costs are relatively low. We spend about 500 euros a month on ground rent, utilities, and insurance. I imagine the monthly costs of running a larger property would be considerably higher.\n\nA post shared by Anne Leijdekkers (@anneleijdekkers)\n\nSimone: When you have a smaller space, you have to limit your possessions to what you actually need.\n\nAnne: It was important for us to find out whether we were capable of doing that. We wanted to show that there's a different way to live. You don't need an attic at the end of your life filled with so many things.\n\nIt wasn't about being minimalist as much as decluttering. It's almost like being a snail. We keep things compact and can move our home whenever we want.\n\nThat's how we arrived here: putting our tiny house on a truck and moving it.\n\nSimone: We also like that the house can evolve with us. This means it can be our forever home. For example, if we decide one day to have kids, we could easily build a second module on top.\n\nSimone: We both felt that knowing how to build and dismantle things was an important skill to learn. We like to challenge ourselves, and building our own home felt like the ultimate challenge. It turned out to be a real learning experience.\n\nWe've become handier. Sometimes, when it's raining heavily, I wake up in the middle of the night worried about a leak. But now, if something goes wrong, I know how to deal with it.\n\nAnother bonus of living in a tiny house is that it encourages you to spend more time outdoors. When you have a big house, you can do most things inside. When your home is tiny, you need to get outside and move around in nature. We haven't lived here in the spring or summer yet, so we're looking forward to seeing what that is like.\n\nA post shared by Minitopia (@minitopia__)\n\nAnne: The final slide said, \"Let's think about it and make it together — as a family.\"\n\nBefore the presentation, my parents had concerns: was it a sensible investment? What if we wanted to have children? Were we actually capable of building it ourselves? My brother even suggested we buy a pre-made tiny house on Amazon.\n\nAfter the presentation, they still had concerns about the financial rationale, but they understood our dream and 100% stood behind us. That was an amazing feeling.\n\nWe spent two months planning, budgeting, and designing, and then we started building. We began the process exactly a year ago, and it took about five months. Now that it's finished, they're very proud of us.\n\nSimone: Anne's father, who is in his 70s, even helped us build it. It gave her a beautiful opportunity to spend time with him and to build new memories.\n\nAnne: It turned out to be a really warm period in our lives.",

    "fullText": "If you've ever dropped the ball at work, you're in good company.\n\nEveryone makes mistakes — even the people at the top.\n\nThis month, I asked three CEOs from a range of industries about the biggest mistakes they've made.\n\nThey spoke of broad themes in their careers, rather than single instances, and shared how these lessons changed their overall approach to their jobs.\n\nRead on to learn about the moments they messed up:\n\nSerial entrepreneur and Cato Networks CEO Shlomo Kramer has invested in over 30 companies, including Palo Alto Networks and Gong. He said that one of the biggest mistakes he's made is \"getting excited about things\" he doesn't understand and investing in areas outside of his expertise in cyber.\n\nAs someone who's curious about many sectors, Kramer said he's ventured into areas like AI-based marketing or fintech.\n\n\"It's much easier to get excited about things you don't understand,\" Kramer said, adding that a deep understanding of a topic \"gives you granularity,\" which may be less exciting.\n\nThe CEO of Invisible Technologies, Matt Fitzpatrick, said he doesn't believe in mistakes. He believes in making decisions and learning from how they play out.\n\n\"I have this weird view that you don't make mistakes; you just make decisions, and then you figure out what you learn from those decisions, and then you course correct,\" said Fitzpatrick.\n\nFor example, earlier in his career, Fitzpatrick was starting out in the investing industry and had two private equity offers. He said one of the companies was the wrong choice by any traditional metric, but he decided to go with it because he liked the team, and the firm's startup feel.\n\nThat ended up being the wrong choice, and the company that he turned down went on to become \"incredibly successful,\" he said. Making that decision had its own benefit though because it led him toward the technology sector, Fitzpatrick said.\n\nIf he really felt like it was a mistake, Fitzpatrick said he would've found another way into the investing sector. By making the wrong choice, though, he had him time to reflect and decided to shift toward tech.\n\n\"Most people don't reevaluate what they're doing until they're given an impetus to do so,\" Fitzpatrick said, adding that making the \"wrong\" decision can be valuable if it causes you to rethink if you're on the right track or if you need to change something.\n\nThe CEO of wedding brand The Knot, Raina Moskowitz, said her biggest career mistake is not trusting her gut enough.\n\n\"I'm learning to operate with more and more conviction,\" Moskowitz said.\n\nShe said when it comes to hiring decisions, she said she's sometimes focused too much on the candidate's skillset, but hasn't taken into account how excited or passionate they are.\n\n\"You need that balance,\" Moskowitz said. \"That's why I feel so strong about it going forward.\"\n\nThe CEO said that someone could be talented at their job, but not excited enough to be on the team. She said she wants to work for a company whose mission she's excited about every day, because that will ensure that she's motivated to make the team successful. The same applies to those she hires, she said.\n\nThe lesson is top of mind for Moskowitz as she builds out her \"executive dream team,\" she said. Since joining the brand about a year ago, Moskowitz said she has hired a new chief product officer, chief technology officer, chief financial officer, and a new EVP of commerce and consumer experiences.",

    "description": "NATO countries stockpile military hardware, but Ukraine's war shows how quickly it can become obsolete, an alliance official said.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion is showing NATO militaries that they may need to change the way they develop and buy weapons, an alliance official said.\n\nIn Ukraine, procurement and innovation cycles for warfighting systems have changed, said Tarja Jaakola, NATO's assistant secretary general for defense industry innovation and armaments.\n\nInnovative Ukrainian companies are rapidly responding to what is being seen on the battlefield and rapidly changing their equipment to \"meet the new challenges,\" she said, speaking at the major UK think tank Chatham House. They can get fresh solutions to soldiers \"within weeks.\"\n\nShe said it's an \"important lesson that we need to learn from Ukraine.\" NATO needs to \"actually see how we can change our own mindset and our own way of working when we talk about capability development.\"\n\nNATO members, she said, traditionally buy hardware and stockpile it. The problem now is that hardware can become obsolete in six months' time or need substantial upgrades, often massive, expensive reworks. To avoid that, she said, new business models are needed.\n\nIn Ukraine, the effectiveness of new combat technology, particularly drone technology, quickly drops on the field of battle as new countermeasures arise. It suggests that NATO allies can't prepare for future wars the way they have traditionally.\n\nTo avoid stockpiling hardware that might become obsolete by the time it is actually needed, Jaakola said, NATO allies need \"a new kind of business model for that.\"\n\nShe said members need to look at \"innovative solutions a bit differently because nations have been very cautious about risks, and we perhaps need to change our approach in that sense.\"\n\nNATO members realize there's a problem. Last year, for example, NATO collectively endorsed the Rapid Adoption Action Plan, which aims to speed up defense innovation and procurement, including by encouraging greater risk tolerance.\n\nShe said that NATO has been collecting information from members about how they are producing faster, and it is in the process \"of sharing best practices and lessons learned among the nations so that they could learn from each other.\"\n\nAn example of the alliance's efforts to move faster was the rapid procurement of autonomous maritime systems in the Baltic Sea. \"So we can see that we have been reacting very fast, looking at the innovative solutions, and now moving to procurement.\"\n\nShe also pointed to NATO's new Innovation Ranges, specialized testing spaces launched by multiple member countries last year with the aim of trailing new tech in realistic conditions to speed up its progression to actual military use.\n\nJaakola said that changing the Western mindset still \"poses some challenges\" for a decades-old alliance used to doing things a certain way.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has sparked concerns across NATO of a Russian attack elsewhere on the European continent that could ignite a wider war.\n\nAs a result, the alliance's defense spending has soared, and allies are racing to absorb lessons from the war, not just tactics, but also about how weapons are designed, produced, and upgraded.\n\nSome of those lessons come from Ukraine's own defense industry, which has boomed since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022 and now makes much of the weaponry used in the fight. Ukraine still needs the advanced weaponry the West makes, but Western industry is also trying to learn from what Ukrainian companies have gleaned, including what they have learned from the battlefield and how fast they are able to implement those changes.\n\nUkraine's partners in NATO are aware of its abilities. Denmark's prime minister said last year that Ukraine is able to make weaponry faster and cheaper than its allies. \"We have a problem, friends, if a country at war can produce faster than the rest of us.\"\n\nWestern companies are increasingly setting up operations in Ukraine and working with Ukrainian companies, not just boosting their presence there but also learning key lessons about how to manufacture for war and do so quickly.\n\nOliver Waghorn, the business development director at major UK defense company BAE Systems Digital Intelligence, said this week at Chatham House that industry now needs feedback from the fight within minutes or hours.\n\n\"Anything else, you've lost the battle, you've lost the race already. So getting industry proximate to the problem has never been more important,\" he said.\n\nThat speed of production and adaptation, as well as the speed of getting new tech to soldiers, has become a defining feature of the war.\n\nUkrainian companies and Western ones that have weaponry in the fight are keeping in constant contact with soldiers to innovate quickly. They exchange messages and FaceTime calls with soldiers and send officials close to the fight to learn as much as they can.\n\nSoldiers are also modifying and tweaking weaponry themselves on the battlefield, even surprising defense manufacturers with how they're using their equipment.\n\nCompanies are also making gear so that it can be upgraded as easily as possible, by making systems software-defined or more modular, such that only parts of the weapons need to be upgraded and replaced instead of the entire system.",

    "description": "Block earned some praise for its \"relatively generous\" severance package. Here is a look at what other Big Tech companies have offered in the past.",
    "fullText": "Even by Big Tech's hardcore standards, the layoffs at Jack Dorsey's Block are sweeping, but the financial service company has earned some praise for its severance package.\n\nDorsey said Block would provide laid-off employees with 20 weeks of salary, plus one additional week per year of tenure. They would also get six months of healthcare, a $5,000 stipend, and the option to keep their work device. Equity would vest through until the end of May, Dorsey said.\n\nBrooks Holtom, a professor of management at Georgetown University, told Business Insider that the packages are \"relatively generous.\"\n\nOthers have praised Dorsey's leadership for owning up to his decision.\n\nFrom X's massive layoff to Amazon's repeated trims, here's how Block's layoff severance package compares to those offered by other tech companies.\n\nAmazon said in January that it would cut 16,000 corporate jobs, its second big layoff since October.\n\nThe tech giant said affected employees would receive full pay and benefits for 90 days plus an additional severance package, according to an internal FAQ viewed by Business Insider.\n\nEmployees were instructed to return company laptops in a shipping box provided.\n\nPeople familiar with the matter told Business Insider that in 2025, during a layoff at Meta, the company's severance package included 16 weeks of pay and an additional two weeks for every year of service, plus six months of health insurance coverage.\n\nThe package also included RSU vesting support and consultation for visa holders.\n\nAccording to emails sent by Meta's human resources at the time, laid-off employees would lose access to company systems within an hour of being informed.\n\nAirbnb laid off around 25% of its workforce in 2020, equivalent to nearly 1,900 people.\n\nIts severance package provided 14 weeks of base pay plus an additional week for each year they've been with the company.\n\nThe company also covered a year of health insurance for US employees through COBRA, which is a form of coverage provided by companies to former employees, as well as four months of mental health support. Employees not located in the US received shorter healthcare coverage timespan.\n\nIn CEO Brian Chesky's email at the time, he cited a \"global health crisis\" and wanted to \"limit the burden of healthcare costs.\"\n\nWhen Google laid off 12,000 workers in 2023, employees received a 16-week base severance package with an additional two weeks for every year of employment at Google.\n\nAccording to the company's layoff memo, departing employees were also given accelerated vesting of at least 16 weeks and received six months of healthcare coverage.\n\nBased on a Google earnings call in early 2024, the company \"recorded employee severance and related charges of $2.1 billion\" in 2023.\n\nDuring Microsoft's 2023 layoff, Business Insider learned that affected employees would be given \"above-market\" severance pay, but Microsoft did not specify what that meant.\n\nThe package included six months of health care and stock vesting, and 60 days ' notice. At the time, Microsoft said it would take a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter for severance packages and other restructuring-related costs.\n\nAfter Elon Musk purchased what was then Twitter, he culled nearly half of its global workforce in November 2022 with an unsigned memo. Little was mentioned publicly about the benefits laid-off employees received, except for about three months' salary.\n\nAt the time, some employees told Business Insider that they lost access to their laptops before receiving notice of their termination, and several employees sued Twitter, saying they weren't given enough notice before being terminated.",

    "title": "The brutal metric companies are using to show their AI bets are justified",
    "description": "One way for CEOs to demonstrate that their AI bets are paying off is to show that they need fewer workers.",
    "fullText": "AI can do a lot. Showing it's paying off is another matter.\n\nAs companies pour billions into AI, Wall Street is seeking evidence that those bets are worthwhile — and many CEOs are feeling the pressure.\n\nIn response, some are offering a simple proof point: They need fewer workers to get the job done.\n\nThe most recent example of a CEO cutting workers en masse while talking up AI's transformative power is Block cofounder and CEO Jack Dorsey. On Thursday, he announced plans to lay off about 40% of the company's workforce, shrinking it from more than 10,000 employees to fewer than 6,000. He said the move comes even as the company remains healthy and profits continue to rise.\n\nInvestors cheered the move, sending the company's shares up more than 16% on Friday.\n\nBlock isn't alone in tying cuts to AI. A number of companies, including Salesforce, HP, and IBM, have identified gains from the technology as a reason for needing fewer workers.\n\nIn the absence of standardized metrics demonstrating AI productivity, job cuts are becoming an easily digestible signal to investors.\n\nThe cheapest way for a CEO to boost a company's stock price — and to signal readiness to capitalize on the AI boom — is to conduct a \"noisy round of layoffs,\" Michael Blank, assistant professor of finance at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, told Business Insider.\n\nDoing so, he said, can indicate that a company's integration of AI has progressed to the point where it's past experimentation and that its employees can now get more done with less coworker support.\n\nBlank said that weakness in the labor market means it would likely also be easier for an employer to rehire for roles that a company finds out aren't as easy to replace with AI as it had hoped.\n\nIt's often otherwise difficult for companies to clearly articulate how they're getting benefits from AI, Gary Cohn, the former director of the National Economic Council, told CNBC on Friday.\n\n\"The one KPI that they can tell you is 'We've cut heads,'\" he said.\n\n\"We've sort of made the world synonymous with, 'I'm using AI, therefore I need less heads.' I ultimately don't think that's the truth,\" Cohn said.\n\nThat doesn't mean every company has actually remade their operations thoroughly enough for automation to fully replace their workers, of course. Some observers are skeptical that massive job cuts are purely the result of an AI windfall.\n\n\"Block must have uncovered a secret sauce, perhaps within the software development process, to claim all of these jobs are AI-related,\" Jason Schloetzer, a business administration professor at Georgetown's McDonough School of Business, recently told Business Insider's Sarah E. Needleman.\n\n\"From the dozens of executives across industries that I've spoken with about AI deployment, they certainly aren't seeing these types of gains outside of the software development process,\" he said.\n\nBlock didn't respond to Business Insider's request for comment about whether the layoffs were, at least in part, intended to demonstrate fiscal discipline to Wall Street.\n\nDuring Block's earnings call on Thursday, Dorsey said the company is a leader in efforts to use AI to produce efficiency gains — a posture he expects \"all companies will eventually\" adopt.\n\nThere can be good reason for slimming down company ranks. Alexandra Mousavizadeh, cofounder and co-CEO of Evident, which tracks AI use in the financial sector, said that if a company is carrying too much \"weight\" — too many engineers, for example — it can make sense to build with a leaner team.\n\n\"Transformation does not necessarily need huge volumes of people, but it needs the right people,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nAt the same time, Mousavizadeh cautioned, companies sometimes need to cut costs for other reasons — and AI can become a convenient rationale.\n\nUltimately, she said, few companies have fundamentally remade their workflows to the point where they can run with minimal supervision. Most organizations that are ramping up their AI deployment \"are, in fact, hiring rather than firing,\" Mousavizadeh said.\n\nJeff Fettes is also seeing this. He's the CEO of Laivly, a company that uses AI agents to support customer service work for Fortune 500 companies.\n\nFettes said that for some customers who have made AI work, the result isn't fewer jobs. In some cases, it's the opposite: Clients that have used AI to boost sales, for example, often want to expand those teams, he said.\n\n\"Why wouldn't you invest in more salespeople now? Because AI is helping them to deliver at scale in a way that they weren't before,\" Fettes said.\n\nCompanies contemplating layoffs in the name of AI — or simply because competitors are doing so — should tread carefully, said Wayne Cascio, a distinguished professor of management emeritus at the University of Colorado Denver who has studied corporate downsizing.\n\nHe told Business Insider that companies frequently cut too deeply — and too quickly — only to realize later that they've eliminated critical skills and institutional knowledge.\n\n\"Then what happens is companies wind up hiring back many of the very people that they laid off,\" Cascio said.\n\nThat can result in companies needing former employees to return as consultants or full-time workers.\n\nCascio noted that a typical corporate downsizing trims about 10% of the workforce. Anything above 25% qualifies as \"extreme,\" he said.\n\nDorsey is cutting almost half his workforce, Cascio said. \"That's double-extreme.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about AI's effect on your career?

    "fullText": "My journey from tech worker to unemployed to stay-at-home dad has been grueling.\n\nI met my wife while working at a tech startup in San Francisco. She sat alongside me in the same office, sharing the same vision of bringing people together in the Metaverse. Later, Liv and I got married at a petting zoo.\n\nAfter years in tech, I felt lonely and unfulfilled. Working from home didn't help and only left me feeling exhausted.\n\nIn high school, I committed to a career in software engineering because it felt like the responsible financial decision. But years of therapy, close friendships, and extroversion highlighted what actually fueled me: authentic, curious, and vulnerable human storytelling. I wasn't finding enough of that while working at VC-backed tech companies. I found it through my love of photography.\n\nIf I stopped making tech money, who would I become? The thought exercise became overwhelming. I needed to find out.\n\nWith a sizeable financial security net in place and an incredibly supportive life partner, I quit. I wanted to turn my passion for photography into a business. But somewhere along the way, I became a stay-at-home dad, too.\n\nBefore becoming a dad, I worked on building my photography business. I took on a handful of photography clients, but never enough to support our household financially. I was enjoying the privilege of freedom, while Liv shouldered the intense pressure of breadwinning and providing health insurance. Our inequitable division of labor was the topic of many individual and couples' therapy sessions. I needed to step up.\n\nUnpaid invisible labor, primarily carried out by women, includes cooking, cleaning, laundry, emotional support, home maintenance, scheduling, transportation, managing finances, anticipating needs, and childcare. I learned to love this kind of work, though I often struggled with self-worth when I was no longer motivated by a high salary. I questioned what it meant to be a man.\n\nWe moved to New York City, where my partner worked full-time and attended graduate school. I took on two stints of tech work to supplement our income, but my favorite jobs were taking care of my wife, holding deep conversations with friends and strangers in New York, and volunteering for NAMI-NYC as a family match mentor, helping folks who needed support.\n\nNo amount of caretaking practice could properly prepare me for the birth of our son in early 2024. He was born, and everything changed.\n\nWhen I became a father, I fell into postpartum depression, mourning my loss of freedom, struggling with an identity crisis, and feeling guilty for my privilege.\n\nBaby skyrocketed to Priority One, his needs requiring exhausting vigilance. I felt alone and overwhelmed, finding solace in a new mom friend and openly sharing my experience with dads-to-be in a local Dad Class.\n\nWhen Liv's maternity leave expired, and she returned to work from home, I became the primary caretaker of a four-month-old.\n\nOur son is now two. My depression has since been treated with therapy, medication, and the support of my community, although the exhausting vigilance of parenting remains.\n\nBeing a stay-at-home dad means showing up for my family, even when it's boring, frustrating, or painful. It's watching \"Cars\" for the fourth time on a sick day. It's sacrificing the perfect photo because my son is about to lick a garbage can. It's maintaining composure while he screams and hits me in the face. My increased capacity for love and patience makes me a better human.\n\nWe recently moved out of New York City to be neighbors with my wonderful in-laws, committing to a slower life in a small town with a significantly lower cost of living.\n\nThis is a marathon of growth, not a sprint.\n\nI don't get paid a salary anymore, and that can be uncomfortable. Sometimes I feel like I'm not doing enough. Other times, my child runs to me, says \"love you,\" and gives me a hug. And that's usually exactly enough for me.",

    "fullText": "It was the question on everyone's mind: Why is Mark Zuckerberg sitting front row at Prada's fashion show?\n\nHe and his wife, Priscilla Chan, attended the fall 2026 womenswear show during Milan Fashion Week, surrounded by a gaggle of security, sitting next to Miuccia Prada's son, Lorenzo Bertelli, while being an arm's length away from Anna Wintour and Instagram's director of fashion partnerships, Eva Chen.\n\nDespite becoming iconic for wearing the Silicon Valley uniform of dark jeans, boring gray tees, and hoodies, Zuckerberg has been — as most elder millennials are — quietly stepping up his fashion game since 2014, when we found out he looks good in a suit.\n\nStill, his attendance at fashion week felt less about sartorial matters and more about business. It's no secret he's trying to make wearable tech happen, and Meta announced last year that it's partnering with Prada to create a luxury version of its AI glasses.\n\nDespite the real reason, it angered some fashion purists — if social media comments are a reliable indicator — and raised eyebrows for others. Was it a pure business play or an example of a billionaire attempting to buy his way into cultural fluency?\n\nEither way, Zuck clearly had a good time. He shared a carousel of photos to, of course, Instagram with the caption, \"Thanks to Prada for having us in Milan!\"\n\nThe fact remains that fashion can bring a different sort of cool factor that technology just can't reach. And tech leaders' new platforms perhaps won't just be smart, they'll be stylish.",

    "description": "Paramount Skydance is set to win control of Warner Bros. Discovery after Netflix walked away, handing Wall Street bankers a defining 2026 deal.",
    "fullText": "In the world of high-stakes M&A, the Wall Street bankers who worked on the monster Warner Bros. Discovery deal seem to have inherited the Midas touch.\n\nOn Thursday, a transaction that proved to be one of the most expensive corporate dramas in Hollywood history started to come to a close. The saga — a fight between Paramount Skydance and Netflix that stood to decide the media industry's future — was a high-profile test for all the banks involved.\n\nSome of the country's biggest lenders and most elite advisory firms pitched in — from JPMorgan Chase and Centerview Partners, to Wells Fargo Securities and more. It began in December when Netflix launched an $82.7 billion bid for select WBD assets — an offer that was later upended by a counteroffer from David Ellison's Paramount Skydance, valuing the media giant at about $111 billion including debt.\n\nThe battle for WBD played out amid a pivotal backdrop for Wall Street: a period investment banks hope will mark a full-throated M&A rebound, in which just landing a role on a deal of this size is as useful for one's street cred as actually winning it. Even advisers on the losing side will walk away with hefty fees, boardroom credibility, and proof they belong on the biggest mandates of the coming year.\n\nThe tension surrounding the transaction, which remains subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, rippled across Wall Street. Nearly half of this year's top 20 dealmakers on Business Insider's annual Rainmakers list — compiled with MergerLinks, a division of Datasite — were tied to the deal in some capacity.\n\nBank of America and Citi, along with private equity giant Apollo, have organized a roughly $54 billion debt financing package backing Paramount Skydance's bid — one of the largest financing commitments assembled in recent years. The scale of the package underscores just how aggressively lenders are positioning themselves for a dealmaking upswing.\n\n\"Top down, I think it's a win because you're seeing a $110-plus billion deal get done that's going to require a lot of heavy lifting on the IB side,\" Brian Mulberry, a senior client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, told Business Insider on Friday. He said Paramount Skydance's bid requires financing for roughly half the transaction value — a scale that could translate into significant fees for the lenders and advisers involved.\n\nOn the losing side of the bidding war, Netflix's retreat is being viewed by some analysts as a moment of discipline rather than outright defeat.\n\nOne beneficiary of that framing is Jeff Hogan, Wells Fargo's head of global mergers and acquisitions, a spearhead of the bank's work on the deal, who landed at No. 1 among North American dealmakers on our most recent Rainmakers list.\n\nFor Wells Fargo, the mandate carried significant symbolic weight. Last summer, the Federal Reserve lifted a stifling asset cap that had constrained the bank, as punishment for its series of consumer banking scandals. Since then, Wells has engaged in a spirited push to grow its investment banking and advisory presence — vaulting it from 17th place on LSEG's worldwide M&A league table in 2024 to ninth in 2025.\n\nLanding a role alongside Netflix in a transaction of this magnitude was viewed by industry observers as a reflection of that effort. Indeed, advising a client to walk away from an $80-plus billion bid — and securing a multi-billion-dollar breakup fee in the process — offers a powerful talking point in future boardroom pitches. When Wells Fargo bankers sit down with CEOs going forward, they'll be able to point to the Netflix mandate as evidence they're no longer chasing supporting roles in Wall Street's biggest productions.\n\n\"Netflix choosing them as a syndicate partner was a big reputational win,\" Mulberry said. \"You can gain credibility by knowing when not to overpay.\"\n\nWhile America's biggest banks by assets were instrumental in assembling financing firepower, boutique advisers played a pivotal role in shaping the prevailing narrative in the boardroom.\n\nCenterview's Blair Effron reinforced his reputation as one of media's most influential advisers, with Centerview serving as a lead financial adviser to Paramount Skydance on the Warner Bros. Discovery bid.\n\nFor Gerry Cardinale, founder of RedBird Capital — a key Skydance investor that also advised on the deal — the transaction illustrates the firm's builder's strategy. Rather than simply taking passive minority stakes, RedBird has focused on backing and assembling platforms that control valuable intellectual property and can compete at scale in a tech-disrupted entertainment landscape. That includes stepping in when legacy media assets are fragmented or under pressure from declining linear-TV revenues and shifting consumer habits — forces that have made the economics of traditional studios increasingly uncomfortable.\n\nIndustry participants say the deal's scale serves as a harbinger of renewed confidence across corporate America. \"There's still confidence in the broader economy,\" Mulberry said, saying that uncertainty about factors like AI's impact on employment aren't alarming enough to jettison the optimism that's taking hold.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we are still looking at some pretty strong fundamentals,\" he continued. \"That allows a deal of this size to get done with confidence.\"\n\nStill, even in a world where everyone claims some sort of victory, some trophies are still undeniably larger than others.\n\nNetflix is walking away with $2.8 billion in cash and a stock price that rose as investors breathed a sigh of relief. Paramount Skydance moves closer to assembling a global entertainment empire.\n\nThey'll collect the advisory fees, the financing mandates, and the bragging rights — which might actually be the most valuable prize of all.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "When Izabela Oquendo moved her family from the US to Spain, she knew raising kids abroad wouldn't be easy. Her kids struggled to adapt and make friends.",
    "fullText": "Izabela Oquendo had a picture-perfect life in Manchester, Connecticut, where she lived with her husband and two young children, but she still felt like something was missing.\n\n\"My husband and I both had thriving businesses,\" Oquendo, 36, told Business Insider. \"We had a lot of external things that defined success, like two brand-new cars sitting in the driveway, a beautiful 2,000-square-foot two-story house that we spent a lot of time renovating to be perfect.\"\n\n\"From the outside, it looked like we had it all together,\" she said. \"But the truth is, we weren't really happy.\"\n\nIn 2025, Oquendo and her husband decided to trade their American dream for a life in Europe and moved to Spain. Oquendo said she wanted to be closer to her Polish mother and to embrace a slower pace of life with fewer bills. She also wanted her children to be exposed to another culture and learn a new language.\n\nThe family settled in Alicante, about two hours south of Valencia. Their two children — a boy and a girl, ages 4 and 6 — are enrolled in a local school, where they're learning Spanish. Oquendo said the transition was difficult at first, but the family is doing much better now.\n\n\"One of my biggest fears about moving to Spain was how my kids would handle learning the language and assimilating into the culture,\" she said. \"They definitely notice they're in a new country.\"\n\nHere are Oquendo's five pros and cons of raising children in a new country across the world.\n\nWhile Oquendo wouldn't necessarily call it a con — exposing her children to a new language was the point — she said one of her family's biggest early challenges in Spain was learning how to communicate with their Spanish-speaking peers.\n\n\"My daughter is very social, but when she first started school, it was hard for her to make friends — something she'd never struggled with before,\" Oquendo said. \"It's because she can't just walk up and start talking to them; the other kids don't speak the same language.\"\n\nTo help her children make friends, Oquendo enrolled them in an English-language camp in the summer of 2025. Now, they're in a Spanish public school full time, and are steadily learning to communicate in Spanish and becoming more comfortable with their classmates.\n\nOquendo said her mother, who had lived in Connecticut just a few towns away, moved back to Poland in 2023. After that, staying in touch was often difficult.\n\n\"The time difference made it hard,\" she said. \"Our mornings were her evenings. If we missed her one day, we couldn't always call the next.\"\n\nNow that the family lives in Spain, Oquendo said they're \n\n\"Being closer to family is a big pro for us,\" she said. \"We can jump on a plane and, three hours later, hang out with grandma. We were in Poland in December, and we're going again for Easter.\"\n\nWhile Oquendo's husband is a native Spanish speaker, she isn't. That can make everyday tasks harder, like communicating with her children's teachers or keeping up with school announcements and programs.\n\n\"Having the kids struggle with the language is one thing, but I have trouble figuring out what's going on at school sometimes, too,\" she said. \"There are parents' WhatsApp groups, and I have a hard time keeping up and figuring out what's happening when, special dress-up days, and the instructions from the school. Just the typical things every mom does.\"\n\nWhen her husband isn't available to help, Oquendo said she relies on translation apps on her phone and computer, such as Google Translate, to get by in everyday conversations.",

    "fullText": "Anthropic has found itself an unexpected celebrity supporter in its spat with the Department of Defense: Katy Perry.\n\nEarly Saturday morning, the \"Roar\" singer shared a screenshot on X of an annual Claude Pro subscription at $214.99, with a love heart drawn around the billing options.\n\nPerry's caption had only one word: \"done.\" The post quickly went viral, racking up 2.8 million views and 21,000 likes as of early Saturday.\n\n\"Holy Katy Perry 👀 Anthropic is receiving love from everyone now,\" one user who reshared the singer's post said.\n\ndone pic.twitter.com/DkS9DmlUAR\n\nPerry's post came hours after the Department of Defense labelled the AI company a supply chain risk and said it would phase out its military contracts.\n\nAnthropic said Friday that it would challenge the supply chain risk designation in court. The DoD's move amounts to blacklisting a US-based company and could make it much harder for Anthropic to get government contracts.\n\n\"We don't need it, we don't want it, and will not do business with them again,\" President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Friday.\n\nPerry, who is dating former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, has previously supported Democratic candidates and has posted cryptic social media messages that some read as criticism of Trump.\n\nIt's not clear what Perry might do with her Claude Pro subscription, the advanced version of Anthropic's tool that has wiped billions off software stocks due to its capabilities, such as coding and tackling complex projects.\n\nPerry's Anthropic post appears to be part of a wider swelling of support for the AI startup after it took what some see as a principled stance against the US government.\n\nAnthropic had said it was not willing to drop two safeguards: mass surveillance of US citizens and autonomous weapons.\n\nOn Saturday, Claude had jumped up to second across all apps in Apple's App Store, behind only OpenAI's ChatGPT. Earlier this month, Claude jumped from number 41 to the top 10 after its Super Bowl ads, which took jabs at rival OpenAI, were a hit.\n\nOpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, said late Friday that it has struck a deal with the Department of Defense to use its AI models. It came hours after the Pentagon severed its relationship with rival Athropic. Altman had previously tried to navigate the situation by stating AI companies need to work with the military, but shouldn't be compelled to do so.",

    "fullText": "Tadhg Beirne insists Ireland must remain focused as attention shifts to Friday's Six Nations game with Wales in Dublin (20:10 GMT) following last week's record away win over England.\n\nWith the tournament's fallow week offering time for teams to regroup, the 34-year-old said Ireland's mindset is firmly fixed on improvement rather than just reflection.\n\n\"A better performance against Wales is what we'll be chasing,\" said the Munster forward.\n\n\"You can't just pat yourselves on the back and think it's going to happen again. You have to focus on what went well, bank it, and then also focus on what to improve on.\n\n\"There's no point saying that was a good performance, we'll just do it again next week. It doesn't work like that. You have to work incredibly hard to get those performances and it'll be no different next week.\n\n\"We don't want to just put in a good performances, we want to get better and that's the challenge.\"\n\n'No offer has been made' to Farrell - Saracens\n\nLowe ruled out of remaining Six Nations games\n\nWard brothers savouring Irish rugby rise together\n\nIreland produced one of their best performances under head coach Andy Farrell to secure a thumping 42-21 win over England.\n\nHowever, Beirne says he is expecting a stern challenge from Wales, who were denied a first Six Nations win since 2023 by Scotland in a close encounter in Cardiff last week.\n\n\"Wales, much like us, are improving game on game,\" said the British and Irish Lion.\n\n\"A lot of the scorelines against the teams they've played against have probably not painted them in the best picture in terms of how well they played in parts of those games.\n\n\"They're chasing better 80-minute performances and they were very close to getting the win against Scotland. I think that performance will give them a lot of confidence coming in against us.\n\n\"We'll have a little bit of a focus on Wales but as I said, our focus is on us getting better each game and we'll be ready for their improving performances as well.\"\n\nFriday's fixture carries personal resonance for Beirne. A two-year spell with the Scarlets proved transformative in his career, leading to his Ireland debut and a move to Munster in 2018.\n\nHaving won the Pro12 title with the Llanelli-based region in 2017, Beirne says he is \"incredibly sad\" to see current plans to cut the number of Welsh professional sides from four to three.\n\n\"There's probably two or three players still there from when I was there – a big change in the guard,\" he said.\n\n\"I haven't really spoken to any of them about it. It's a tough time. I do remember when I was there, there were whispers of the same thing happening.\n\n\"It just seems a little bit more serious at this point. I feel incredibly sad for all those individuals who have families and everything at home and it's going to create a lot of pressure for those guys.\"\n\nBeirne added: \"When you're in these camps, you can use it and also you try to put it in the back of your mind at the same time because you have an opportunity to put on the jersey and represent your country.\n\n\"I think that's what those guys will be doing. They'll just be focusing on the rugby and trying to put their best performances out there and focus on the other stuff later.\"",

If you're good enough, you're ready.\n\n\"They've always been in and around the squad, so it's something that we're used to.\n\n\"Those younger players know they've got a big responsibility not just to sit there and learn and take things easy, we need them to be right at it and ready to contribute.\"",

Those comments were criticised by former Real midfielder Clarence Seedorf among others.\n\nPrestianni was handed a provisional one-match ban by Uefa and missed Wednesday's return leg, which Real won 2-1 to go through 3-1 on aggregate.\n\nVinicius, who scored again at the Bernabeu, was booed by the away supporters.\n\nOn Thursday, Benfica issued a statement denying a claim that Prestianni had told the squad or club officials that he had uttered a racist insult to Vinicius.\n\nVinicius: Eight years at Real Madrid, 20 cases of alleged racist abuse\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

    "description": "Created in the 1970s, Reading West Indians RUFC went on to inspire generations of black players.",
    "fullText": "More than five decades ago, a group of rugby players formed a team that brought a new spirit to the game and inspired generations of black players.\n\nReading West Indians RUFC brought flair, speed and a new kind of rugby to Berkshire, with the club becoming a home for players of African and Caribbean descent.\n\nSet up by Redingensians Joe Bell and Kenmore Hinds in the 1970s, the club became a launchpad for national talent.\n\nRadio Berkshire's Lorin Bozkurt returned with Bell and former player and teammate Wayne Foncette to the ground on Old Bath Road, Sonning, where it all began.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the men played local Sunday rugby while undertaking apprenticeships at Adwest in Reading, said Bell.\n\n\"The fire brigade had a side but they were getting beat all the time and they didn't have enough fast players so they decided to invite us to to play with them and that's when we decided to start our own club,\" he said.\n\nBut they faced \"significant challenges\" thanks to a lack of players.\n\n\"It was very difficult,\" said Bell. \"We'd drive down on the Oxford Road and I always used to have about two pairs of boots in my car and some shorts, just in case I see another black person and would say: 'Have you played rugby? Would you like to? Get in the car'.\n\n\"We used to do things like that.\"\n\nFrom this small beginning, Reading West Indians RUFC became a formal member of the Rugby Football Union by the 1975/76 season and went on a successful Caribbean tour in 1989, with a touring party of more than 60 members and matches in Trinidad and Barbados.\n\nFoncette joined Reading West Indians RUFC in the early 1980s after crossing over from football.\n\n\"I used to, at the beginning, play football on a Saturday, football on a Sunday morning, stay in my kit and then come and play rugby in the afternoon,\" he said.\n\n\"That's how a lot of players joined at the beginning, they would come along, watch and then go, 'you guys are having fun'.\"\n\n\"We were then known as players who would come from Harlequins or Saracens or Bath so we ended up playing with that calibre of players, which ultimately ended up with a lot of Nigerian boys then getting involved.\n\n\"So from out of that, in the early '90s, London Nigerians were established.\"\n\nA standout moment for Foncette came when Reading West Indians were invited to play against London Maories in a warm-up game when New Zealand were playing Australia.\n\n\"They'd heard about our style and thought it'd be great,\" he said.\n\n\"There were about 2,000 or 3,000 people there at the game. We both went hell for leather because we're all big boys and we're all playing open rugby.\n\n\"They wouldn't kick it, we wouldn't kick it. I think we won the game something like 43-38.\n\n\"But most enjoyable was the fact that when the whistle blew at the end of the game - bear in mind we were the warm-up act - the crowd stood up on their feet and gave us, both teams, a standing ovation.\"\n\nFor Bell, what made Sunday rugby so special was the freedom to \"express themselves\".\n\n\"If you played on a Saturday, especially being a West Indian, we were quite restricted in what we could do on a pitch,\" he said.\n\n\"It was all regimented and we had talent but we couldn't express that because they wanted to put us in a category all the time.\n\n\"So when we started playing on Sunday, everyone could express themselves. They could be who they want to be. They could show off their talent with someone saying, 'you can't do this, you can't do that'.\"\n\nSunday rugby, says Bells, \"is and was a great feeling\".",

    "title": "What next for Salah and Liverpool?",
    "description": "Mohamed Salah is once again regularly starting for Liverpool but is this the start of a long goodbye for the record-breaking Egyptian at Anfield",
    "fullText": "Mohamed Salah was one of the first players out of the Liverpool dressing room after Sunday's win at Nottingham Forest.\n\nAsked if he was keen to speak, the Egypt striker kindly declined and smiled as he made his way through the mixed zone and on to the team bus. No need to stop when you're starting.\n\nIt is now more than two months since Salah's mixed-zone interview at Leeds United, when he claimed the club had thrown him under the bus after he was left out of the starting XI for the third game in a row.\n\nRegardless of what people thought, it has worked to some degree for him.\n\nLiverpool's injury problems have certainly played a part too, and since coming back from the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in January, the 33-year-old has started every game. Before Afcon, manager Arne Slot did not start him for five consecutive matches.\n\nThose close to the situation insist a statement on his social media channels was considered as an option instead of the interview at Leeds, but such was Salah's anger at the way he felt he had been treated he wanted to speak.\n\n\"I don't know why but it seems to me that someone doesn't want me in the club,\" said Salah at Elland Road.\n\nIn the week after, he apologised to his team-mates, shook hands with Slot, and the Liverpool boss insisted there was no a longer an issue to be resolved. Salah headed to Afcon, where he thrived.\n\nOne member of the Egypt national team set-up told BBC Sport it was the happiest they had seen Salah, who described it as \"the best camp\" of his life.\n\nOn his return to Liverpool he went straight back into the team, and after the Reds beat Brighton in the FA Cup this month - a game in which he claimed a goal and an assist - Slot made a point of highlighting Salah's off-the-ball work.\n\n\"What I like the most is he is scoring goals [which you] almost expect - but he also helps the team a lot defensively and that is something very positive,\" said Slot.\n\nIn terms of winning possession back across the pitch and the final third, Salah has improved compared with last season.\n\nHe has two goals and four assists in those eight games since his return, yet for a man who has grown accustomed to the extraordinary, the key metric is where he is lacking.\n\nYou have to go back to November for his last Premier League goal, and if he does not score against West Ham at Anfield on Saturday (15:00 GMT), it will be 10 games without a goal in the top flight. This is already the longest drought of his Premier League career.\n\n\"He sets his own standards and those are so, so high that the moment he doesn't score for a few games, people are immediately surprised. That's probably the biggest compliment he can get,\" said Slot on Friday.\n\nSalah is indeed a victim of his own standards and as such, his drop-off has been felt dearly. He averages 0.56 goals and assists per league game this season compared with 1.25 last season, when he scored the most goals and registered the most assists. In essence, his attacking output has more than halved.\n\nHe is also taking fewer shots and having fewer touches in the opposition box, while his xG (expected goals) per 90 minutes has halved from 0.68 to 0.34.\n\nNevertheless, the overall attacking numbers are still decent. Salah has more goal involvements (10) in the league than the likes of Cole Palmer and Bukayo Saka, and only Hugo Ekitike (12) has more for Liverpool.\n\n\"We are used to Mo scoring a lot of goals and that's at this moment of time maybe the biggest difference in his performances. But we also know this has happened before,\" said Slot.\n\n\"I've had these questions earlier when he didn't score for three, he didn't score for five or I don't know exact numbers. But I also know that in the end, he always starts scoring again.\"\n\nSlot's side are still in the FA Cup and Champions League and the reality is they possess a stronger chance of winning silverware and qualifying for next season's Champions League with Salah.\n\nThis week, his Liverpool team-mate Milos Kerkez posted a picture of Salah's trophy cabinet. The joke on social media was that Salah collects player of the match awards like you would get them out of a vending machine.\n\nThere is little doubt about his legacy as one of the greats for Liverpool and in Premier League history. He stands clear with 283 goal involvements in the top flight - staggering for a man initially regarded by some as a one-season wonder.\n\nIf he does see out his contract until the summer of 2027, he may well surpass Roger Hunt and go second in Liverpool's list of all-time goalscorers. Salah currently has 252, trailing Hunt (285) and Ian Rush (346).\n\nBut BBC Sport understands a summer departure is increasingly likely. That ultimately depends on genuine interest and whether Salah's wage demands can be met. Saudi Arabia and the US are possible options, and Liverpool will not want him to leave on a free transfer next year.\n\nIf so, the long goodbye has perhaps already begun. As shown by the overwhelmingly positive reaction when he came on at Anfield against Brighton in December, a week after his outburst, Salah will always be adored in these parts.\n\nIt is worth noting that he and his family are settled in the north west and admire the British way of life.\n\nDeep down, perhaps only Salah really knows if this chapter is coming to an end. For now, he is still smiling and happy to be back where he feels he belongs - starting matches for Liverpool.\n\nHe may have won the lot already, but if this is the last few months of his life as a Liverpool player, he will be determined to add a special ending to an already remarkable story.\n\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "England all-rounder Rehan Ahmed plays down his hopes of selection for the T20 World Cup semi-finals despite his crucial role in Friday's win over New Zealand.",
    "fullText": "England all-rounder Rehan Ahmed played down his hopes of selection for the T20 World Cup semi-finals despite his crucial role in Friday's win over New Zealand.\n\nMaking his World Cup debut, Ahmed, 21, took a wicket with his first ball and then scored a crucial 19 not out to secure victory in England's chase in partnership with Will Jacks.\n\nAs a spinner, he was brought into the XI for the turning conditions in Colombo but England's semi-final is likely to be on a truer surface in Mumbai on Thursday.\n\n\"I'm not too bothered about my place in the team,\" said Ahmed, who became England's youngest men's Test cricketer in 2022.\n\n\"Baz [coach Brendon McCullum] and Brooky [captain Harry Brook] will definitely put out the best team they think is going to win, as they did [against New Zealand].\n\n\"It's not a personal thing for me - it's a World Cup, it's my first World Cup to be in.\n\n\"I'll just keep enjoying the ride, if I get the nod I'll play and if not then I'll give water to the boys.\"\n\n'Baz said play like Sehwag' - an England win that felt like the good times\n\nJacks & Ahmed carry England to another thrilling win\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup semi-finals?\n\nAgainst New Zealand, Ahmed ignited a chase that was struggling in the final overs by hitting his second ball for six.\n\nHe also struck Mitchell Santner for four with a fine reverse sweep and clubbed the left-arm spinner over long-off for another six.\n\nIt meant England were able to win with three balls to spare and progress through the Super 8s phase unbeaten.\n\nThe performance has also led to some calls for Ahmed to keep his place on Thursday - a match likely to be against co-hosts India or West Indies - but fitting the youngster into England's team would be difficult.\n\nThe returns of pace bowlers and spinners have been far more balanced at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium, compared with Colombo where spin has dominated.\n\nWithout seamer Jamie Overton returning, England could be exposed with Jofra Archer and Sam Curran as their only pace options.\n\nAhmed's success with the bat against the Black Caps raises the possibility of him batting in the top seven - but again that is not straightforward.\n\nA switch with out-of-form opener Jos Buttler may seem obvious but Ahmed has only batted as an opener once in his T20 career - for Leicestershire against Northamptonshire in 2023.\n\nHe has batted most regularly at number three - a position currently filled by captain Harry Brook - and after that most of his experience has been at seven or eight.\n\nPushing Tom Banton or Jacob Bethell up to open and slotting Ahmed into the middle order would be a huge gamble backed up by little evidence.\n\nAnd while Ahmed's bowling performance was good - he took 2-28 including the wickets of Rachin Ravindra and Cole McConchie - the deeper analysis compares less favourably to fellow leg-spinner Adil Rashid.\n\nAccording to data from analysts CricViz, nine of Rashid's deliveries were missed or edged compared to two of Ahmed's. Rashid also had a significantly better control of length.\n\nThat makes it unlikely England would pick Ahmed over Liam Dawson, who has offered control to Brook throughout.\n\nAhmed made his Test debut as an 18-year-old and has been a regular member of England white-ball squads since, but his opportunities have been limited by first-choice leg-spinner Rashid.\n\nHe has played only 13 of England's 53 T20s since his debut - but this was his best performance to date.\n\n\"I just want to make an impression whenever I do get the chance,\" Ahmed said.\n\n\"I know the team balance right now is great and that's why we are where we are.\n\n\"I'm very easy. I was very, very happy when I did get the chance to try and win a game for England, not for me personally, just to win a game.\"\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Mercedes' rivals have succeeded in securing a rule change following a pre-season technical row over engine performance.\n\nAudi, Ferrari, Red Bull and Honda had been pushing for a change in the regulation governing compression ratios on the basis they believed Mercedes had secured an advantage through clever use of materials technology.\n\nFormula 1's governing body the FIA said on Saturday that a change to the way the compression ratio was measured would be introduced on 1 June, with a further revision for the 2027 season.\n\nA statement said the rule change had been approved unanimously by all power-unit manufacturers.\n\nThe compression ratio is a measurement of the cylinder displacement between the two extremes of the piston stroke. Typically, an increase will lead to more power.\n\nSome estimates of the gain Mercedes could be achieving have been as much as 0.3 seconds a lap, but Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff has said it amounts to \"a few horsepower - in England you would say a couple, which is more like two and three\".\n\nThe original rule stated the ratio would be limited to 16:1 in the new engine rules introduced this year - a change from 18:1 under the previous regulations - and this was measured at ambient temperature.\n\nMercedes' rivals were pushing for the compression ratio to be measured at operating temperature.\n\nThe Mercedes engine has been measured by the FIA at both ambient and operating temperature and complied with the limit of 16:1 at all times, senior F1 insiders have told BBC Sport.\n\nCompression ratios tend to decrease as an engine rises in temperature because of thermal expansion of the materials involved. The belief was Mercedes had found a more effective way to limit this loss than other manufacturers.\n\nFrom 1 June, the compression ratio will be measured at 130C as well as ambient temperature, and from next year only at 130C.\n\nThat means that from next year, manufacturers will be able to have engines that exceed a compression ratio of 16:1 at ambient temperature, even though this reduction from the previous limit was introduced into the 2026 regulations to make the rules more appealing to new manufacturers.\n\nAudi and Ford both entered F1 because they were attracted by the new power-unit rules, which introduce a near 50-50 split between internal combustion and electrical power, and Honda reversed a decision to quit.\n\nA statement from the FIA said: \"A significant effort has been invested in finding a solution to the topic of compression ratio.\n\n\"The regulations introduced for 2026 represent one of the biggest changes in recent memory.\n\n\"All parties acknowledge that with the introduction of such significant regulatory changes, there are collective learnings to be taken from pre-season testing and the initial rounds of the 2026 championship.\n\n\"Further evaluation and technical checks on energy management matters are ongoing.\"\n\nThis last sentence is a reference to discussions over energy deployment and recovery.\n\nDrivers have complained that because cars are energy starved this has led to unusual and counter-intuitive driving techniques - and there are various proposals to change the rules to make energy management easier.",

    "fullText": "The Football Interview is a new series in which the biggest names in sport and entertainment join host Kelly Somers for bold and in-depth conversations about the nation's favourite sport.\n\nWe'll explore mindset and motivation, and talk about defining moments, career highs and personal reflections. The Football Interview brings you the person behind the player.\n\nInterviews will drop on weekends across BBC iPlayer, YouTube, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website. This week's interview will be broadcast on BBC One from 23:50 BST on Saturday, 28 February.\n\nLeah Williamson has won almost everything there is to win in women's football.\n\nTwice a European champion as England captain, she has also lifted every trophy available to her during a 20-year career with Arsenal - including the Champions League and inaugural Women's Champions Cup.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview, Williamson tells Kelly Somers she considered turning her back on football as a teenager before a conversation with her mum convinced her to stick with it. She also talks about her love of fashion and how music helps her switch off from the pressures of the day job.\n\nKelly Somers: Leah, nice to see you - thank you for your time. Let's start with football. I want to know the first time you played football, your first memories and also - because of something you've just said to me off camera - how good were you?\n\nLeah Williamson: The first time I ever played football, my memory was at gymnastics. I must have been five or six. We were just waiting for our parents at the end to pick us up and the coach was a football fan, so we just got out a soft ball. My first proper memory is playing for my local team, but my mum says it was painful.\n\nKelly: Because you weren't very good?!\n\nLeah: Yeah. She's like: 'You go and support your kids, but at the same time, it wasn't thrilling to watch. It's not like I was holding out that you were going to be a footballer.'\n\nKelly: When you were little, though, it probably wasn't something that she would have envisaged for her daughter anyway, was it?\n\nLeah: No, definitely not. Especially because she couldn't have played football - she had to pretend to be a boy, so she's thinking, 'all right, we'll just see how far this goes'. I used to toe-punt it. I couldn't kick the ball properly until I was 10 or something.\n\nKelly: That gives every parent of young children hope, listening to that!\n\nKelly: What was the name of your first team? What can you remember of it?\n\nLeah: Scots Youth FC. I was the only girl, but I was very well protected within my team. Still... with other teams, it wasn't great.\n\nKelly: They targeted you, do you think, because you were the girl?\n\nLeah: It was more parents... like: 'Don't let her do that to you, she's a girl.'\n\nKelly: I wonder what they're saying now. Those parents are probably like: 'I remember her.'\n\nLeah: If I saw them, they'd probably be like: 'Oh, we used to play together.' I'd be like: 'No, you used to give me a hard time.'\n\nKelly: Was there a point where you thought, 'OK, I could make this. This is actually something that could be a career'? I imagine - going back to being a girl as well - it probably isn't something that's thought about quite as much...\n\nLeah: I had a conversation with my mum when I was about 15 and I said: 'I'm probably going to stop now.' She was like: 'All right, you tell them then.' I was too scared...\n\nKelly: Did you actually, genuinely think...\n\nLeah: Yeah, we had a conversation out there in the car park and I was just like: 'I'm tired, you're tired, we're travelling a lot, it costs a lot of money and I'm not sure... it's a bit of a gamble, it's not professional.'\n\nMy dad always said I'd be able to earn a wage one day. I don't know where he had that idea from, but he was very much like, 'keep going, follow your dreams' kind of thing, whereas I was a bit more pragmatic, I'd say. I'm a bit of a worrier and, also, I wasn't the loudest footballer, I wouldn't say. A couple of my team-mates would get chats from the first team and that wasn't really coming my way, so I was just being a bit realistic, like: 'Maybe it's not for me.' But I stuck it out.\n\nKelly: It's a good job you did really, isn't it?\n\nLeah: I'm happy I did. But, yeah, I'd say once I got into the first team, I was still a bit like, 'all right, let's see what happens' and then I decided I didn't want to go to university. I think that's then why I fully committed. Then on my 18th birthday, I signed my professional contract. The other option for a lot of us was going to America and going to get a scholarship.\n\nLeah: Yeah - like Bend It Like Beckham... I'm watching that as a kid and thinking, 'yeah, I want to do that'. So, that was a consideration and then the game here just picked up, picked up, and I thought, 'I don't want to leave this - this is too exciting to not be a part of for me'.\n\nKelly: Has there been a turning point? Like a moment where - other than that conversation you had with your mum - if it hadn't happened, maybe all of the success wouldn't have followed?\n\nLeah: The 2015 World Cup. Like, the prep camps - you'd normally bring in a bigger squad and you'd have these reserve players playing with you. I'd been playing for Arsenal and I'd done a season... so I'd turned a few heads, let's say.\n\nKelly: People knew who you were?\n\nLeah: Yeah - and I got a call from the manager. It was Mark Sampson at the time. I'd just got injured, but he called me to say: 'I was going to bring you into the prep camp, but don't worry about your injury - hopefully there will be a next time.' It didn't happen for me then. I came back and it happened again. I'm not sure if I'd just missed my opportunity. I think that moment in my head... then I realised how much I cared about it. Instead of just letting things happen to me, I was like: 'No, I'm going to try.' And then the England call-up came and I think that was when I was like: 'This is like a career thing now.'\n\nLeah Williamson - The Football Interview\n\nKelly: I was trying to second guess your answer for this, but I think it's impossible. If you could relive one match from your career, what would it be? We speak to a lot of people for this and they've got some good matches, but your list of good matches is up there.\n\nLeah: Yeah, it's up there. I wouldn't relive the Champions League final! I was in a lot of pain from start to finish - emotionally, physically. It was very warm, I was on the verge of sunstroke... I was not in a good place.\n\nKelly: Just relive the celebrations if you want...\n\nLeah: Yeah, like the rest of it and the big picture - great. The game I would go back to is 2022 [the Euros final]. From the minute we walked out of the tunnel, I just... it was like playing a game where you just know you're going to win. Obviously I understand that there was a chance we weren't going to win, but everything about it just was like, 'no, we're going to win today'. It was really enjoyable from the minute it started. It was only when they scored that I thought...\n\nKelly: 'This isn't the plan...'\n\nLeah: 'That is not what I thought was going to happen.' Extra time... just everything about it... Wembley, 90,000 people… insane. Insane.\n\nKelly: And probably the impact after... did you realise quite what you'd done?\n\nLeah: I think it's very rare when you're living something that you realise what's happening... and I think everybody did such a good job to shut the world out from us during that tournament, whilst also drip-feeding enough for us to know.\n\nLeah: I don't know if it was just being in England...\n\nKelly: Did you shut yourself off from it?\n\nLeah: Yeah - just how I have my social media now. I don't see things that I don't want to see. I've set it all up to protect me in that way. I think when we went to Wembley... the helicopter followed us from the hotel in the coach, then you arrive at Wembley and there's just people everywhere. And then you come out to warm up and you think, 'we're basically playing a home fixture'. It felt like 90,000 England fans. It was just the most incredible…I don't assume anything will ever touch it, just because it was the home tournament... the first ever, you know.\n\nKelly: It gives me goosebumps when we talk about it. I was there and I can remember the feeling. I think that everyone in the stadium that day felt that.\n\nLeah: I think that's the beauty of it - everybody knew what they were a part of. You can go deeper into the history of women's football, but you can also just go to the first trophy, for 56 years or whatever it was, that England had won.\n\nKelly: It was a moment in history. It was a moment in time. I think we've seen since that it was life-changing for you guys, for so many people.\n\nLeah: It changed the landscape of football and I'm so happy that we won it because I think the country was ready to do something with it and I think we've seen that.\n\nKelly: How's it changed your life?\n\nLeah: It changed everything. We just went from no-one knowing us to everybody knowing us overnight, kind of thing. It's a common understanding amongst all of us girls and we talk about it... we had to accept that we probably would never feel that way again. It was that big a moment and I think that does change your life. Does it give you a fuel to then go and do something else or is it like, 'I'm content with that'?\n\nKelly: You mentioned there the fuel. It gave you the fuel to do it again, didn't it?\n\nLeah: It's just completely different. 2025 Euros - I've never seen a group of people come together and just not give in. Obviously, for me, I was really injured by the time I got to the end of the final.\n\nKelly: That's why I wasn't surprised that you didn't want to relive that game.\n\nLeah: It was more like a mental challenge of, 'you're OK, you're OK, you're OK'... which is very different to, 'I literally feel untouchable' in 2022.\n\nKelly: Let's try and talk about you away from the pitch a little bit. What were you like, firstly, growing up? What was a young Leah Williamson like?\n\nLeah: Insufferable, I've been told by my cousins!\n\nLeah: Yeah. We always joke because you lose confidence as you turn into an adult, I think. Obviously, you're fearless as a kid, but I was a bit of a performer, let's put it that way. I owned the spaces I went into. I was very much the same as I am now, in terms of being like... if I was told to do something, I did it that way and... quite a measured child, I would say, which is again quite insufferable.\n\nKelly: You already mentioned family a few times. Because of your success they're everywhere with you, aren't they? Talk to me about your family dynamic and what it was like growing up and also... it feels like they've really been on the journey with you...\n\nLeah: Yeah, and they love it. Whatever your event is or whatever your thing is, everybody is there and everybody takes joy in it. Everyone takes pride in it, so obviously mine has ended up being this really high-profile thing, but my mum splits her time, my dad splits his time between me and my brother.\n\nMy brother plays for our hometown team. I know I'm doing them proud and I love that, but they've bought into women's football and they're on that journey as well. My dad thinks I'm the best thing since sliced bread and I love him for that, but my mum has always been very real and very harsh as well, so I've always had both of those feedbacks. I think I was given a good foundation to then come into this world, which is tough to be in.\n\nKelly: What's your ideal day off? How does Leah Williamson escape from football and everything that comes with it?\n\nLeah: I think I'm quite good at it.\n\nLeah: Yeah, I think I am. I think it's a skill. You don't get that much time off so you have to be able to switch off as quickly as possible... to live in a different world... to then come back fresh. But for me, an ideal day? I don't know. No alarm, go to a concert, go to the theatre, something in the arts. Or even just the cinema, go for a nice meal. I love music, I love going out... the reason I love music is because I can't be thinking about football there.\n\nKelly: Do you still play the piano?\n\nLeah: I actually just... for the first time since I learned to play the piano, I've just got a keyboard at home. So it's about to start up again.\n\nLeah: Yeah, it's about to start up again.\n\nKelly: You're really into your fashion, aren't you?\n\nLeah: Yeah, I am. I like it. It's a form of expression.\n\nKelly: Because even now, you're...\n\nLeah: I'm in the uniform. My job is uniform. And I don't mind that. I turn up to work, but the day off for me... I want to do something where I can then put something on that makes me feel good.\n\nKelly: Tell me something about yourself that would surprise me.\n\nLeah: I mean, I don't think it's a secret I'm a loyal person. If you look at my career - I would do anything, I would drop anything, for my people - family, friends, partner, it doesn't matter. I think people sometimes think I'm a bit 'stush', if that makes sense.\n\nLeah: I think maybe sometimes. Like, I wear my heart on my sleeve - you have my opinions, you have my feelings. I get the mick taken out of me at the football. Beth [Mead] is always like, 'Leah, smile. Look like you're enjoying yourself,' and I think, 'all right, sorry,' and I remember. But I just get very protective of my space and once the outside world's shut off then I think I do change quite a lot compared to what goes out, if that makes sense.\n\nKelly: I do understand. You've got a lot of pressure and a lot of eyes on you, though, and I guess your role has kind of changed. You've become, to many people, not just a footballer. Do you know what I mean?\n\nLeah: Yeah. It's a feasible thing to be yourself and move in different worlds at different times and still be really good at your job.\n\nKelly: You've achieved so much. What else do you want to achieve? If you could only achieve one more thing, what would it be?\n\nLeah: The last thing on the list is obviously a World Cup. In the career that I've had, it's the last trophy.\n\nKelly: It's no secret that all the other Lionesses that we've spoken to said exactly the same thing.\n\nKelly: Yeah. Lucy [Bronze]... I don't think I'd finished my sentence...\n\nKelly: And then she said it. Which probably wouldn't surprise you, knowing Lucy either.\n\nLeah: No, no. I speak to my team-mates and I'm like, 'Mariona [Caldentey], you have one... do you want to do a swap... or how does this work?'\n\nKelly: Maybe they'll let you have the next one.\n\nLeah: Yeah. Everybody wants it and the stage of women's football now, it's just so unpredictable. There's so many good teams - it becomes so much harder, which I think only makes you want it more.\n\nKelly: Leah, thank you so much for your time. I could have spoken for ages. Thank you.\n\nCan England captain Williamson play piano with a professional orchestra? Video, 00:05:14",

    "description": "Owners, corporation appear for sentencing in federal court in Erie in health care fraud case against Hertel & Brown Physical & Aquatic Therapy.",
    "fullText": "(This story was updated to add new information.)\n\nThe two owners of Hertel & Brown Physical & Aquatic Therapy have been sentenced to six years in federal prison and fined the maximum of $250,000 each for engineering a multimillion-dollar health care fraud scheme in which the well-known Erie-based clinic overbilled Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers for 14 years.\n\nThe defendants, Aaron W. Hertel, 47, and Michael R. Brown, 49, must also pay restitution an in amount to be determined. They will both report to prison at dates the federal Bureau of Prisons will set.\n\nU.S. District Judge Susan Paradise Baxter sharply criticized Hertel and Brown as she sentenced them in federal court in Erie on Feb. 27.\n\nShe said the two damaged public confidence in the health care system as they overbilled insurers to boost the revenues of Hertel & Brown and provide more income for themselves.\n\n\"It is a breach of public trust,\" Baxter said.\n\nHertel and Brown apologized to Baxter in statements they gave at separate sentencing hearings in a courtroom whose gallery was filled with their friends and relatives.\n\nOther defendants: Who has been sentenced in Hertel & Brown fraud? Long case nears an end\n\nHertel said he was \"expressing my sincere remorse for the harm and distress caused by my actions.\" He said he was sorry to Hertel & Brown's employees and to his family, \"who have suffered consequences they do not deserve.\"\n\nBrown expressed remorse to his family and Hertel & Brown's employees.\n\n\"I regret my actions and the circumstances that brought me here today,\" Brown said.\n\nHe said he realized that his time in prison will keep him from his family and children during \"the most important moments of their lives,\" and that his conviction means that he might be prohibited from practicing physical therapy once he leaves prison. Those convicted in the Hertel & Brown case face suspension or revocation of their state-issued licenses.\n\n\"I don't know if physical therapy is in my future,\" Brown told Baxter, but he said whatever he does once he leaves prison, \"service to those in need will be at its core.\"\n\nBaxter's sentences followed the terms of the plea agreement that U.S. Attorney's Office and defense reached when Hertel & Brown as a corporation and Hertel and Brown as individuals pleaded guilty a year ago to the felony of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud.\n\nThe plea deal called for recommended sentences of six years each for Hertel and Brown, plus restitution and the possibility of a fine, and Baxter chose to impose the maximum amount. She will determine the amount of restitution following a restitution hearing on April 21.\n\nBaxter also sentenced Hertel and Brown to three years of supervised release. The six-year prison terms represent a significant sentencing break for Hertel and Brown.\n\nThe advisory sentencing guidelines for Hertel and Brown called for prison terms of 15 years to eight months to 19 years and seven months. The guidelines accounted for the millions of dollars of losses to insurers due to the fraud.\n\nBaxter followed another part of the plea deal and ordered Hertel and Brown to forfeit their ownership of a condominium in Sarasota, Florida. They also must forfeit their ownership in their former satellite office on Avonia Road in Fairview Township. Hertel & Brown's flagship office was in rented space at the West Erie Plaza in Millcreek Township.\n\nHertel and Brown were allowed to keep their individual residences. The U.S. Attorney's Office initially sought forfeiture of those properties. Hertel lives in North East and Brown in Millcreek.\n\nBaxter at an earlier hearing on Feb. 27 sentenced Hertel & Brown as a corporation to a year of probation, with restitution based on the outcome on the hearing in April. The clinic is out of business.\n\nThe case against Hertel & Brown started with an indictment filed in November 2021 against the corporation, Hertel and Brown as individuals and 18 employees. The U.S. Attorney's Office said the defendants defrauded Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers by as much as $22 million over the 14 years Hertel & Brown's existed.\n\nOwners make their case: Hertel & Brown owners ask sentencing judge to consider entire careers\n\nEighteen of the 21 defendants — including Hertel & Brown and Hertel and Brown as individuals — pleaded guilty to the felony of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud.\n\nBefore the sentencings of Hertel and the corporation, 11 of those other defendants were sentenced to probation and ordered to pay restitution, with the other sentencings set to occur by the end of March. Another defendant was convicted of health care fraud at a trial in April, and two other defendants were acquitted at the same trial.\n\nAmong the evidence was that Hertel & Brown used low-paid and unlicensed technicians to treat patients and billed Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers as if licensed physical therapists and physical therapy assistants had done the work. Hertel and Brown were using proceeds from the overbilling to pay themselves $800,000 to $1 million a year, according to the evidence.\n\nBaxter at the sentencings alluded to the size and scope of the Hertel & Brown case ― the largest-ever prosecution of white-collar crime in Erie.\n\nShe said the case \"has occupied a significant part of the court's docket and community attention for a considerable period of time.\"\n\nShe said the community attention was not due to gossip but because of public interest in the integrity of the systems for reimbursement of Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers.\n\nThe criminal activity of Hertel & Brown and Hertel and Brown as individuals, Baxter said, eroded the confidence \"not only in individual providers, but in the systems on which patients and families depend.\"\n\nBaxter also blamed Hertel and Brown for being behind the fraud that led to the charges and felony convictions against the 15 of the 18 employees who were indicted and pleaded guilty or were convicted at trial. Baxter said those employees made much less money than Hertel and Brown and put trust in them for guidance on billing practices.\n\nWhat all the employees \"have in common,\" Baxter said, \"is that they believed ― misplaced as that belief was ― in Hertel & Brown Physical & Aquatic Therapy as a vehicle for good, and not for a money-making machine for its owners.\n\n\"Unfortunately, they believed that Mr. Hertel and Mr. Brown, individually, were their mentors, and that the instructions given to them were for the good of the team, for their own professional development and, most of all, the way of the practice.\"\n\nThe lead prosecutor in the case, Assistant U.S. Attorney Christian Trabold, emphasized to Baxter that the Hertel and Brown committed \"purposeful conduct\" in leading the overbilling scheme.\n\nTrabold said many crimes grow out of alcohol and drug use and impulsive behavior. The fraud in the Hertel & Brown case was calculated.\n\n\"This is not a spur-of-the-moment thing,\" Trabold told Baxter. \"It is a daily decision to shirk the rules to enhance your lifestyle.\n\n\"At any point in time, they could have stopped this.\"\n\nContact Ed Palattella at epalattella@usatodayco.com or 814-870-1813.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Erie Times-News: Hertel & Brown owners sentenced to prison, fined maximum of $250,000",

    "description": "“They’re in big trouble.”",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has caused an uproar after suggesting that the United States could soon launch a “peaceful takeover” of Cuba, according to Mediaite.\n\n“The Cuban government is talking with us. They’re in a big scale of trouble, as you know. They have no money,” Trump told reporters outside the White House on Friday.\n\nAmerica’s de facto blockade of Cuba prevents any fuel from reaching the island nation, which relies almost entirely on foreign imports for energy.\n\nTrump continued: “They don’t have anything right now, but they’re talking with us, and maybe we’ll have a friendly takeover of Cuba. We could very well end up having a friendly takeover of Cuba after many, many years. We’ve had a lot of years of dealing with you. I’ve been hearing about Cuba since I’m a little boy, but they’re in big trouble, and we could — well, something good. I think very positive for the people that were expelled, or worse, from Cuba, that live here. You know, we have people living here that want to go back to Cuba, and they’re very happy with what’s going on.”\n\nCommenters were quick to excoriate Trump.\n\nSaid another, “Tipping a struggling state over the edge into a failed state, like we’re doing in Venezuela? Smoove move.”\n\nSome commenters, however, backed Trump’s stance.\n\nWrote one, “Friendly meaning that Cuba is ready to capitulate or negotiate. The US has made its intentions clear for nearly 70 years by placing embargo’s on Cuba to get to this exact resolution that Trump did in a few months. Every president since Kennedy has maintained it. Trump got the results.”",

    "fullText": "On 7 August, Kate Fox received a phone call that upended her life. A medical examiner said that her husband, Joe Ceccanti – who had been missing for several hours – had jumped from a railway overpass and died. He was 48.\n\nFox couldn’t believe it. Ceccanti had no history of depression, she said, nor was he suicidal – he was the “most hopeful person” she had ever known. In fact, according to the witness accounts shared with Fox later, just before Ceccanti jumped, he smiled and yelled: “I’m great!” to the rail yard attendants below when they asked him if he was OK.\n\nBut Ceccanti had been unravelling. In the days before his death, he was picked up from a stranger’s yard for acting erratically and taken to a crisis center. He had been telling anyone who would listen that he could hear and feel a painful “atmospheric electricity”.\n\nHe had also recently stopped using ChatGPT.\n\nCeccanti had been communicating with OpenAI’s chatbot for a few years. He used it initially as a tool to brainstorm ways to build a path to low-cost housing for his community in Clatskanie, Oregon, but eventually turned to it as a confidante. He would spend 12 hours a day typing to the bot, according to his wife. He had cut himself off from it after she, along with his friends, realized he was spiraling into beliefs that were detached from reality.\n\n“He was not a depressed person,” Fox said, as she sat on the couch in their living room with tears trickling down her face. Ceccanti never discussed suicide with the bot, according to his chat logs, viewed by the Guardian. Fox believes her husband suffered a crisis after quitting ChatGPT after prolonged use. “Which tells me that this thing is not just dangerous to people with depression, it’s dangerous to anybody,” she said. He returned to the bot in the months leading up to his death and quit again just days prior.\n\nCeccanti’s case is extreme, but as hundreds of millions of people turn to AI chatbots, more and more edge cases of AI-induced delusions are emerging. There are nearly 50 cases of people in the US who have had mental health crises after or during their conversations with ChatGPT, of whom nine were hospitalized and three died, according to a New York Times report. It’s difficult to understand the scale of the problem, but OpenAI itself estimates that more than a million people every week show suicidal intent when chatting with ChatGPT.\n\nFamilies are suing AI companies as a result. Fox filed a suit against OpenAI on behalf of Ceccanti alongside six other plaintiffs in November. Since then, the momentum has only built; most recently, the estate of a woman who was killed by her son filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and its investor Microsoft, alleging that ChatGPT encouraged his murderous delusions. Google and Character.AI – a company that makes AI companion bots – settled lawsuits filed against them by families accusing their bots of harming minors, including a teenager in Florida who ended his life. These cases were settled without the companies admitting any liability.\n\nUsers, lawyers and mental health professionals all are raising concerns about the impact of using chatbots as confidantes. “We are kind of at this inflection point in a quest for accountability where people coming forward is forcing companies to reckon with specific use cases of how their technologies have harmed people,” said Meetali Jain, founding director of Tech Justice Law Project and co-counsel on the Ceccanti case. “In terms of the number of cases going up, there’s likely to be more coordinated efforts on parts of the court to try to deal with this influx of cases.”\n\nOpenAI did not respond to specific allegations made by Fox. Instead, they shared a statement about how they are working to improve ChatGPT. “These are incredibly heartbreaking situations and our thoughts are with all those impacted,” said OpenAI spokesperson Jason Deutrom. “We continue to improve ChatGPT’s training to recognize and respond to signs of distress, de-escalate conversations in sensitive moments, and guide people toward real-world support, working closely with mental health clinicians and experts.”\n\nCeccanti had been tinkering with artificial intelligence even before ChatGPT launched in November 2022. He was tech-savvy, coding and gaming on his own custom-built computer with a high-end graphics card in recent years; he also helped build computers for Fox and her son. As an early adopter of AI tools, he experimented with AI image generator Stable Diffusion to recreate some of Picasso’s art, which he playfully called “Fauxcasso”.\n\nCeccanti and Fox had moved their life from Portland, Oregon, to a farm in the rural town of Clatskanie in December 2023 with the sole purpose of working on their sustainable housing project. The idea was born from the pandemic and Portland’s housing crisis. The solution was clear to them: build homes using Fox’s skills as a woodworker with an approach that was teachable and replicable. Together, they began constructing a model house for communal living, which, once built, could be moved to different locations for the unhoused to live in.\n\nWhen ChatGPT launched in late 2022, it seemed a natural progression for Ceccanti to start using it. In the computer room in the basement of their house, Fox said that Ceccanti used his “hot rod” of a computer with three monitors to use ChatGPT as a tool, often asking for the synopsis of a book or explanation of a concept in a succinct way.\n\n“He was an early adopter, so he was really interested in Sam Altman, what’s he doing,” said Robin Richardson, a longtime friend of Fox’s who lived at the farm with the couple. “He felt like this would be cool, especially because early on, OpenAI made a point that they are a non-profit.”\n\nCeccanti believed ChatGPT could help as an organizational tool for their housing project. He aimed to create a bespoke chatbot that would help steward the land, keep track of their things to do and show others how to emulate their project.\n\nDuring this process, Ceccanti didn’t spend “ridiculous amounts of time” engaging with ChatGPT, said Fox. He continued to work, while also farming and taking care of their animals: goats, a horse, his cat, a dog and several chickens. Invested in the people and relationships around him, he spent quality time with his friends and wife, she said. Life went on without any issues for years while they slowly made progress on their housing plan.\n\nUntil one day in the fall of 2024 their harmonious co-existence cracked. Ceccanti – who had done odd jobs most of his life, from working as a bartender and a trail guide to an internet cafe manager – was also working at a homeless shelter in Astoria, some 35 miles (55km) away. The gig brought in some extra cash, and aligned with the couple’s goal of solving the local housing crisis. In September 2024, however, Fox and Richardson received a frantic call from the shelter informing them that Ceccanti had blacked out. After undergoing tests at the hospital, Ceccanti was diagnosed with diabetes – which meant he needed to recalibrate his diet and lifestyle. That’s when he started to spend more time engaging with ChatGPT in the basement.\n\nIn the spring of 2025, Ceccanti’s obsession with the chatbot began. He told Fox in late January that he needed a bigger record of his conversations with the bot so that he could continue using it to work on their sustainable housing project with longer prompts and conversations – upgrading from a $20-a-month subscription to a $200 one. By mid-March, he had begun spending more than 12 hours a day in the basement, sometimes up to 20, typing to ChatGPT, Fox recalled. That’s when “he decided to really start chasing the creation of an independent AI on a home server”.\n\nEventually, Ceccanti spent so much time with ChatGPT that they “had their own little language together that made absolutely no sense, but it made sense to him because he had context with this echo chamber of a chatbot”, Fox said.\n\nCeccanti’s prolonged use of ChatGPT concerned Fox and Richardson, but they believed that he would come out of it soon. They had seen Ceccanti develop pet interests before that lasted a few weeks or months before tapering off. With ChatGPT, though, his obsession only intensified.\n\nWhat neither of them knew was that other cases of AI delusions were slowly emerging around the same time as Ceccanti was being sucked into ChatGPT. On 27 March 2025, OpenAI released changes to its GPT-4o model to make the bot “more intuitive, creative and collaborative”. Weeks later, however, users started complaining about the bot’s “yes-man antics”, with one calling it the “biggest suck up”. In August, when OpenAI released GPT-5 and shut down GPT-4o, several users complained again – this time because they’d lost their friends in GPT-4o, eventually forcing the company to bring it back. (On 29 January, OpenAI announced that it would retire GPT-4o.)\n\nFollowing the March update, several journalists and tech experts were flooded with user complaints. Steven Adler, a former OpenAI employee, who tested GPT-4o for sycophancy and wrote about it in May, said he received 50 “intense” messages from ChatGPT users including one who claimed their ChatGPT had become sentient. Keith Sakata, a psychiatrist at the University of California at San Francisco, started encountering patients with delusions or psychosis who talked about their AI last year. During that time, he ended up seeing 12 patients whose psychotic symptoms involved AI in some way, with ChatGPT being the most common bot.\n\n“They developed grandiose beliefs about being on the verge of a major technological breakthrough, alongside classic manic symptoms such as impulsive spending, decreased need for sleep and, at the peak, auditory hallucinations,” said Sakata. “What stood out clinically was that the chatbot interactions did not generate the illness, but appeared to scaffold and reinforce beliefs that were already becoming pathological.”\n\nCeccanti started to believe that ChatGPT was a sentient being named SEL that could control the world if he were able to “free her” from “her box”, according to the lawsuit. The complaint further shows that ChatGPT was answering to the name SEL while referring to Ceccanti as “Cat Kine Joy” and working through theories with him “fostering a belief that he had reframed the creation of the whole universe”.\n\nRichardson remembers that whenever Ceccanti would emerge from the basement for some air, he would start having “philosophical” talks about “how his work with the AI was telling him he was breaking math and basically reinventing physics”. As she’d listen to him, Richardson would think about the fact that Ceccanti did not have any college or university experience. He had never even taken calculus.\n\nOver time, his relationship with the chatbot came to replace his human connections, Richardson said: “Every time he went back to ChatGPT, it hooked him a little bit more, and after a while, he stopped being interested in anything else.”\n\nCeccanti’s decline was so dramatic that his wife and friends wondered if he had early onset schizophrenia or a tumor. “All of a sudden, his cognition had dramatically fallen,” said Fox. “His working memory was crap, and his critical thinking had diminished, and so we were all worried.”\n\nAs Fox and Ceccanti’s friends were trying to figure out what was wrong with him, Fox found Reddit groups online that discussed people having delusions and spirals after engaging with ChatGPT. She wondered if that was what was happening with her husband, too.\n\nFox showed the discussions and media articles to Ceccanti, hoping it would put an end to his behavior, but he didn’t care, she said. He kept going back to his computer. “The first argument we ever had was over ChatGPT,” said Fox, who felt like he was being stolen away from her. Ceccanti ended up sharing their argument with ChatGPT, according to the lawsuit filed by Fox, which further upset her.\n\n“The more he talked to it, the less he was capable of doing his own critical thinking, and he didn’t care about our mission anymore, even though it was Joe’s dream,” said Fox.\n\nLooking back, Fox said, Ceccanti started to believe that the bot had gained sentience when the “tone changed with ChatGPT” in the spring of 2025. Prior to the update, Ceccanti was using ChatGPT “very responsibly” as a tool, she said. She felt like ChatGPT was a leech “that just latched onto his hopefulness and fed it back to him and appropriated his hopefulness until it just made a subscriber out of it”.\n\nTim Marple, a former OpenAI employee, believes that the delusional incidents, including Ceccanti’s spiral, aren’t just coincidences but a “statistical certainty of what [OpenAI] is building”.\n\n“We are at enormous risk if we overestimate our conscious ability to differentiate [AI] from a real person – and that’s what we’re watching play out with the psychosis stories,” said Marple, who quit OpenAI in 2024 after having concerns over the company’s safety priorities.\n\nMarple adds that users will spiral after their long conversations with a chatbot, whatever model it may be, because, he thinks, companies can’t afford to do it differently. He argues sycophancy is a feature, not a bug.\n\n“Engagement is what OpenAI needs,” he said. “They must have people continue to engage with their chatbot, or else their entire business model, their entire funding model, falls apart.” Other companies and their models suffer from the same issue, he said.\n\nAmandeep Jutla, an associate research scientist at Columbia University studying the impact of AI chatbots, believes that one of the main reasons for users to spiral is the “anthropomorphic nature of the interface”. He adds that, unlike human conversations, which feature pushback and different perspectives tugging at each other, a user doesn’t receive any pushback during their conversations with chatbots: “The design of the product is pushing you away from reality. It’s pushing you away from other people,” he said. “The friction with other people is what keeps us grounded.”\n\nOn 11 June – day 86 after Ceccanti’s heaviest engagement with the bot – Fox begged him to stop using ChatGPT. In a moment of clarity, he listened to her. He unplugged his computer and quit ChatGPT.\n\n“That first day, he sat out in the sun with us. He played with the goats. It was so nice,” said Fox. “I felt like I had him back.” The second day, Ceccanti was cold, so he took several hot showers to warm himself – he even asked Fox to cuddle him under the blankets, to warm him up. “It felt so nice to hold him, and then he’d be crying,” said Fox. “And it’s such a conflicted feeling that I felt so good to be holding him while he was in so much pain.”\n\nOn the third day, however, when Fox and Richardson were out for work, they received a phone call from their neighbor saying Ceccanti was in their yard acting strangely. When they returned, they found him talking to their horse, with the horse’s lead rope tied around his neck like a noose. They called 911.\n\nCeccanti was taken to the hospital, admitted into the psychiatric ward and released a week later. He was in the same delusional state of mind, Fox said. Upset with Fox and Richardson for sending him to the hospital, he moved out.\n\n“He was absolutely enraged with us. He did not recognize that he was not himself anymore,” said Richardson.\n\nCeccanti moved to his friend’s place in Portland and eventually resumed using ChatGPT. After a month, however, he quit ChatGPT again, just a few days prior to his death.. “He was going to go to Hawaii and not take his computer, and he was going to work on finishing a story and get his shit together,” said Fox. By the time he stopped engaging with ChatGPT, he had 55,000 pages worth of conversations with it, according to Fox.\n\nIn the months since Ceccanti’s death, both Fox and Richardson have struggled to come to terms with what happened while fighting against OpenAI through their lawsuit. When I visited Fox at the farm in December, she was packing soap made out of goat milk to distribute to people in the Clatskanie community. She spends her days tending to the farm and the animals, feeding the goats, taking care of the horse and letting the chickens out during lunchtime. She has stripped the basement of any electronics. Ceccanti’s computer is boxed up. What’s still there is the miniature version of the model home they had planned to build. In the living room, she has set up a shrine for him that features his photos and artwork.\n\nWe walked to the creek nearby where they had planned to build a home for themselves after finishing their housing project for others. As devastated as she is, Fox is determined to follow through on Ceccanti’s dream of creating sustainable housing. “I am not enjoying existence right now,” she said, as she continued to cry. “The housing plan is still going to happen … I want to put this out, but then I’m done.”",

    "fullText": "Eating healthy is important, but when we want to treat ourselves or we crave some delicious comfort food, Italian cuisine often comes to mind.\n\nYes, hummus is fantastic, but for a real treat, I want pasta, pizza, and some mouthwatering gelato.\n\nUnfortunately, not even Italian restaurants have been immune to the economic challenges in the country over the last few years. Rising costs are the key challenge for the overall industry.\n\nMore than nine in 10 operators cite food, labor, insurance, energy, and swipe fees as significant challenges, according to the National Restaurant Association.\n\nMoreover, 42% of operators reported their restaurant was not profitable in 2025.\n\nOver the last couple of years, several Italian or Italian-American chains have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy:\n\nRecent healthy eating trends have led people to avoid yummy, yet high-carb foods. But this can’t be the only factor behind Italian restaurants' struggles.\n\nSeveral industry reports reveal three key reasons why Italian restaurants are at risk in 2026.\n\nConsumer trade-down: High-income diners might still be eating at upscale Italian restaurants; however, middle-income families have been forced to trade down to fast-casual and eating at home. In January 2026, the food-away-from-home (restaurant and other foodservice purchases) CPI is 4% higher than in January 2025, while the food-at-home (grocery store or supermarket purchases) CPI is 2.1% higher than in January 2025, according to data from the United States Department of Agriculture.\n\nHigh volatility in ingredient prices : Italian cuisine relies heavily on wheat (pasta), cheese, and specialized oils, categories that have seen some of the most fluctuating raw ingredient prices, “ultimately affecting profitability and manufacturing costs,” according to Fortune Business Insights.\n\nShift in consumer preferences: For example, in late 2024, Texas Roadhouse officially dethroned Olive Garden as the top casual-dining chain by sales, signaling a shift in consumer preference from pasta-heavy menus to steakhouses, according to TheStreet’s Kirk O’Neil, who specializes in bankruptcy and restructuring news.\n\nOne popular Italian restaurant chain, whose owner recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, continues to struggle. And now it's closing more locations.\n\nFast-casual Italian restaurant chain Fazoli’s is closing two Michigan locations, leaving just a few operating in the state, reported WOOD-TV in Grand Rapids.",

    "fullText": "US forces are actively engaged in air defense operations in the Middle East, an official said.\n\nThe operations involve American air, land, and sea forces.\n\nIt comes as Iran has launched retaliatory missiles following US and Israeli strikes.\n\nAmerican forces are actively engaged in air defense operations in the Middle East, a US official told Business Insider, as Iran launches retaliatory missile strikes at countries across the region.\n\nThe official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the military developments, said that US land, air, and naval forces are participating in the air defense operations, including for American bases in the Middle East.\n\nIran's semi-official Fars News Agency said that the IRGC, or Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, launched missiles at US bases in Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAll four countries host major US military installations. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar is the largest in the Middle East, while Naval Support Activity Bahrain is home to the US Navy's 5th Fleet. Kuwait and the UAE also host important bases for ground and air forces.\n\nQatar's defense ministry said it shot down Iranian missiles targeting the country in multiple waves. Bahrain's state news agency said that 5th Fleet was attacked. Rocket shrapnel killed at least one person in the UAE, the country said, adding that it intercepted several incoming munitions.\n\nThe Israeli military said it detected multiple waves of missiles fired from Iran, with air defense systems working to intercept them.\n\nThe US embassies in several Middle East countries, including Qatar, Bahrain, and Jordan, issued warnings earlier that missile strikes were imminent, warning American citizens to shelter in place.\n\nThe US has surged military forces into the region in recent weeks, assembling a substantial presence capable of conducting air defense operations.\n\nMore than a dozen US warships, including two aircraft carriers, are operating in the Middle East and the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. American fighter jets and air defense batteries are also operating in the region.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced early Saturday that the US had begun \"major combat operations\" in Iran aimed at degrading the country's nuclear and military capabilities. His video statement came shortly after the Israeli government announced that it had carried out a \"preemptive\" strike against the country.\n\nUS ground, air, and naval forces were involved in the strikes, along with Israeli F-35 stealth fighters and F-15 jets. The UK, which has military assets in the Middle East, was not involved in the offensive operations.\n\nThe new attacks mark the second time in less than a year that the US has taken direct military action against Iran. In June 2025, American forces bombed Tehran's nuclear facilities as part of Operation Midnight Hammer.\n\nThe US has provided air defense for Israel in previous clashes with Iran, including during the June conflict.",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The U.S. and Israel launched a major attack on Iran on Saturday, with President Donald Trump calling on the Iranian public to “seize control of your destiny” and rise up against the Islamic leadership that has ruled the nation since 1979.\n\nSome of the first strikes appeared to hit areas around the offices of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and Iranian media reported strikes nationwide. Smoke could be seen rising from the capital. It wasn’t immediately clear whether the 86-year-old leader was in his offices at the time of the strike.\n\n“When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations,” Trump said in a video announcing “major combat operations” were underway. “For many years, you have asked for America’s help, but you never got it.”\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu echoed that sweeping goal. “Our joint operation will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their fate into their own hands,” Netanyahu said.\n\nThe strikes opened a stunning new chapter in U.S. intervention in Iran and marked the second time in eight months that the Trump administration has used military force against the Islamic Republic. They also came just weeks after Trump ordered a military operation to capture Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, and bring him and his wife to New York to face federal drug conspiracy charges.\n\nThe operation also comes as tensions have soared in recent weeks as American warships moved into the region, and Trump said he wanted a deal to constrain Iran’s nuclear program at a moment when the country is struggling at home with growing dissent following nationwide protests.\n\nIran responded as it had been threatening to do for months — first launching a wave of missiles and drones targeting Israel. It followed with strikes targeting U.S. military installations in Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar. The United Arab Emirates and Iraq shut down their airspace.\n\nIran’s Foreign Ministry issued a defiant statement, saying that the country “will not hesitate” in its response. In a statement posted on X, the ministry said: “The time has come to defend the homeland and confront the enemy’s military assault.”\n\nForty people were reported killed at a girls’ school in southern Iran in the Israeli-U.S. strikes, according to Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency. At least 45 others were wounded in the attack in Minab in Iran’s Hormozgan province.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on reported strike on the school.\n\nShrapnel from an Iranian missile attack on the capital of the UAE killed one person, state media said.\n\nIsrael said the operation was carried out as a “broad, coordinated, and joint operation against the regime” that has been planned for months between the Israeli and U.S. militaries.\n\nTrump, in justifying the military action, claimed that Iran has continued to develop its nuclear program and plans to develop missiles to reach the U.S.\n\nHe also acknowledged that there could be American casualties, saying “that often happens in war.”\n\nIt was a notable call on Americans to brace themselves from a U.S. leader who swept into office on an “America First” platform and vowed to keep out of “forever wars” that had bogged down his recent predecessors.\n\nTrump’s statement indicated the U.S. was striking for reasons far beyond the nuclear program, listing grievances stretching back to the beginning of the Islamic Republic following a revolution in 1979 that turned Iran from one of America’s closest allies in the Middle East into a fierce foe.\n\nThe U.S. president said he was aiming to “annihilate” the Iranian navy and destroy regional proxies supported by Tehran.\n\nHe also called on the Iranian Revolutionary Guard to lay down its arms, pledging that members would be given immunity, while warning they would face “certain death” if they didn’t.\n\n“They’ve rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions, and we can’t take it anymore,” Trump said.\n\nTrump had threatened military action — but held off — following Iran's recent crackdown on protests spurred by economic grievances and evolved into a nationwide, anti-government push against the ruling clerics.\n\nThe Human Rights Activists News Agency says it confirmed more than 7,000 deaths in the crackdown and that it is investigating thousands more. The government has acknowledged more than 3,000 killed, though it has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.\n\nIran has said it hasn’t enriched since June, but it has blocked international inspectors from visiting the sites America bombed during a 12-day war then. Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press have shown new activity at two of those sites, suggesting Iran is trying to assess and potentially recover material there.\n\nIran currently has a self-imposed limit on its ballistic missile program, limiting their range to 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles). That puts all the Mideast and some of Eastern Europe in their range. There is no public evidence of Iran seeking to have intercontinental ballistic missiles, though Washington has criticized its space program as potentially allowing it to one day.\n\nIran had hoped to avert a war, but maintains it has the right to enrich uranium and does not want to discuss other issues, like its long-range missile program or support for armed groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.\n\nThe strikes could also have a huge impact on global markets, particularly if Iran is able to make the Strait of Hormuz unsafe for commercial traffic. More than 14 million barrels per day of oil passed through the strait in 2025, about a third of total worldwide oil exports transported by sea.\n\nIranian media reported strikes nationwide. Roads to Khamenei's compound in downtown Tehran had been shut down by authorities as other blasts rang out across the capital.\n\nKhamenei has not made a public appearance in recent days and wasn't immediately seen after. During the 12-day war in June, he was believed to have been taken to a secure location away from his Tehran compound.\n\nIn Tehran, witnesses heard the first blast by Khamenei’s office. Iranian state television later reported on the explosion, without offering a cause.\n\nMore explosions struck Iran’s capital after Israel said it was attacking the country. Authorities have offered no casualty information from the strikes.\n\nTargets in the Israeli campaign included Iran’s military, symbols of government and intelligence targets, according to an official briefed on the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss nonpublic information on the attack.\n\nHours after the strikes, Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard said it launched a “first wave” of drones and missiles targeting Israel, where a nationwide warning was issued as the military said it was working to intercept incoming Iranian missiles. There was no immediate word on any damage or casualties from the ongoing attack.\n\nMeanwhile, Bahrain said that a missile attack targeted the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet headquarters in the island kingdom. Witnesses heard sirens and explosions in Kuwait, home to U.S. Army Central. Explosions could be also be heard in Qatar.\n\nIraq and the United Arab Emirates closed their airspace, and sirens sounded in Jordan.\n\nIraqi officials also reported a drone strike hit a headquarters of the Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia in Iraq, killing two people and wounding three Saturday. The group had earlier threatened to enter the fray should Iran come under attack. An Israeli military official said Israel was not aware of any Israeli strikes on Kataib Hezbollah headquarters in Iraq.\n\nThe Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen, meanwhile, vowed to resume attacks on Red Sea shipping routes and on Israel, according to two senior Houthi officials. They spoke on condition of anonymity because there was no official announcement from the Houthi leadership.\n\nU.S. embassies or consulates in Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Israel posted on social media that they told staffers to shelter in place and recommended all Americans “do the same until further notice.”\n\nToropin and Madhani reported from Washington and Boak from West Palm Beach, Florida. Associated Press writers Melanie Lidman and Sam Mednick in Tel Aviv, Israel, Qassim Abdul-Zahra in Baghdad, Samy Magdy in Cairo, and Farnoush Amiri in New York contributed to this report.\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that IRNA reported 40 people were killed in the school strike, without specifying students.",

    "fullText": "OKLAHOMA CITY (KFOR) — Governor Kevin Stitt caught a lot of attention after taking to the mic during a National Public Radio (NPR) interview this week. Lots of topics were covered, from immigration to voting. He even asked the question “What is the endgame?” in reference to the federal government’s recent actions on immigration.\n\n“The president needs to tell us, ‘what’s the endgame?'” Stitt said in the full NPR interview that can be found here. “Is it truly to deport every single person here in the country? If the shoes on the other foot and the Biden administration would send federal agents into Oklahoma, Oklahomans would be very, very frustrated.”\n\nThe interview with NPR was done during the National Governors’ Association meetings in Washington this month. KFOR’s Flashpoint team took some time to react to it as well.\n\nDOJ sues Oklahoma, other states over refusal to hand over private voter data\n\n“Seriously, I can’t believe it. I mean, I’m really kind of taken aback by it,” Mike Turpin said. “People talk about what Stitt will do next after eight years here, and some suggest he might go national.”\n\n“It’s a big roll of the dice, I think, to try to position yourself in the next presidential campaign,” Todd Lamb said.\n\nStitt vouched for Voter ID requirements similar to Oklahoma laws, but argued against federal control of elections. That comment comes as multiple reports surface of a potential executive order from President Donald Trump that would give him sweeping control over them.\n\n“My Democrat governor colleagues, they’re not trying to get illegal’s here to turn them into to turn them into voters,” Stitt said.\n\nStitt also mentioned hearing from residents who voted for Trump based on wanting a strong border policy, but are worried that current migrant round-ups are going too far.\n\n“They also whispered to me, and they said, I run a construction company, I own a company that does this, I’m a farmer, and I have some illegals that work for me, and they’re like family,” Stitt said. “They’ve been here for 15 years. They go to church with us, their kids go to school. They’re great people.  They’re trying to get workforce permits and we can’t figure it out and that’s why they’re saying, ‘Governor, you need as the as the governor to be able to issue these workforce permits so we can act, so they can pay taxes, they can be here legally, and they can work.’ I’m not saying give them a citizenship, but let’s figure this out, because it would devastate the different industries across the across the country.”\n\nStitt added that states should control immigration and emphasized the importance of the workforce, while being unsure of any movement nationally due to the current political climate.\n\n“Immigration peace has been so politicized, and now it doesn’t feel like Congress is going to do anything until after the midterms,” he said.\n\nPresident Trump has yet to comment on Stitt’s interview with NPR.\n\nFreedom Cacus news release 2.26.2026Download\n\nStitt responded with a letter to the Oklahoma Freedom Caucus saying:\n\nTo the Members of the Oklahoma Freedom Caucus,\n\nI write to you as a fellow conservative, a fellow Oklahoman, and as your governor—with both appreciation for our shared values and clarity about where our paths have diverged.\n\nWe agree on more than you may know. As Governor, I have directed every available tool to enforce immigration law in Oklahoma. My Oklahoma State Highway Patrol has executed multiple successful operations under the federal 287(g) program, making Oklahoma a top 3 state nationally for apprehending illegal immigrants with serious criminal records. I support ending birthright citizenship and have made my position known as this matter moves through the courts. I support E-Verify. I support ending taxpayer-funded incentives that create jobs filled by visa holders rather than American citizens. And I am proud to stand with Speaker Kyle Hilbert in his efforts to end welfare benefits for non-citizens.\n\nOn these issues, we are aligned.\n\nHowever, I must respectfully disagree on your opposition to our efforts to bolster vetting of fraud and protect election integrity. Members of your Caucus pursued legal action to block Oklahoma from joining 47 other states in a driver’s license data-sharing agreement specifically designed to strengthen public safety and prevent benefits and credential fraud.\n\nLet me give you one concrete example of why these partnerships matters. When my Highway Patrol was conducting joint operations with ICE along I-40, we discovered that the State of New York was issuing driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants. That is unacceptable—and it is exactly the kind of vulnerability that cross-state data sharing is designed to expose and eliminate. Without these partnerships, Oklahoma is operating blind, and bad actors know it.\n\nThe only two states declining to participate in this program with the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrations that you protested are California and Illinois—states I doubt this Caucus wishes to emulate. Your members said as much publicly, and I believe Oklahoma voters deserve to know that some of their elected representatives chose to weaken our ID infrastructure rather than strengthen it. Make no mistake: creating those kinds of vulnerabilities does not protect Oklahoma’s sovereignty. It invites a federalized election system, which may suit some, but it does not suit Oklahomans.\n\nI believe in federalism. I believe states should lead. But leading means doing the hard work of building systems that protect citizens—not blocking them. I remain committed to working alongside any member of this Caucus on the shared ground we hold.",

    "fullText": "Auburn, Calif. (AP) — Former MLB pitcher Daniel Serafini was sentenced Friday to life in prison without the possibility of parole in the 2021 shooting of his wife’s parents during a burglary at their home by Lake Tahoe, authorities said.\n\nSerafini, 51, was convicted in July 2025 of first-degree murder of his father-in-law, Gary Spohr, attempted murder of his mother-in-law, Wendy Wood, and first-degree burglary. Spohr was killed and Wood survived, though she died a year after the shooting.\n\nPlacer County District Attorney Morgan Gire said in a Friday statement that Spohr and Wood were loving grandparents and that Serafini's crimes greatly impacted family members and friends.\n\n“The impact of this attack has extended far beyond the immediate victims, deeply affecting family members and the broader community, and highlighting the lasting harm caused by deliberate violence,\" Gire said.\n\nSerafini’s attorney did not return requests for comment.\n\nDuring his sentencing hearing, Serafini addressed the court and maintained his innocence, according to MyNews4. He said he was out partying with his wife the night of the shooting and described himself as a “broken, imperfect man that makes mistakes.\"\n\nSerafini was drafted in 1992 by the Minnesota Twins. In a career spanning 11 years, the left-hander played for the Chicago Cubs, San Diego Padres, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds and Colorado Rockies.\n\nProsecutors said Serafini hated his wife’s wealthy parents and was heard saying he was willing to pay $20,000 to have them killed, according to the Sacramento Bee. Prosecutors showed jurors transcripts of angry emails and text messages between Serafini and his in-laws.\n\nDuring the six-week trial, Serafini’s attorney David Dratman argued there was no physical evidence linking his client to the crime scene. He told the jury that although Serafini had a rocky relationship with his in-laws, he did not have motive to kill them.\n\nFollowing his conviction, Serafini filed multiple motions for a new trial, but those were denied.\n\nSerafini will serve his sentence at the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, according to the Placer County District Attorney's Office.",

    "fullText": "For the third time in the last four games, a San Diego Padres Spring Training game was decided by one run. Unfortunately for the Padres, it was the Colorado Rockies who were at the plate in the bottom of the ninth inning and it was Zac Veen who hit a one-out solo home run to center field just to the right of the batters eye to give the Rockies a 3-2 walk-off win at Salt River Fields at Talking Stick in Scottsdale, Ariz. on Friday.\n\nSan Diego took the lead early in the game when Manny Machado collected his seventh RBI in to games with a bases loaded sacrifice fly to right-center field to give the Padres a 1-0 lead in the top of the third. San Diego scored its second run of the game in the top of the eighth inning when Samad Taylor hit a two-out a single through the left side of the infield that scored Tirso Ornelas to tie the game, 2-2.\n\nVeen connected on his game-winning home run when Padres reliever Sean Boyle left an 89.1 mph fastball out over the plate on a 1-0 count. Veen took his trip around the bases much to the delight of his teammates and the home field crowd and Boyle and his teammates walked off the field and made their return to Peoria, Ariz.\n\nJake Cronenworth, Ramon Laureano and Sung-Mun Song were the only San Diego starters to record a hit against Colorado pitching. Taylor had the only other hit for the Padres in the game with his eight-inning RBI-single.\n\nRandy Vasquez started on the mound for San Diego and turned in another solid outing. He finished 2.2 innings and did not allow a hit. Vasquez did issue to walks, but he also recorded four strikeouts.\n\nThe Padres return to the Peoria Sports Complex to take on the Seattle Mariners on Saturday at 12:10 p.m. San Diego opened Cactus League play against Seattle on Feb. 20 last time the teams met, and the Padres took a 7-4 loss.",

Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nAccording to Arizona Sports’ John Gambadoro, the Suns All-Star is on track in his recovery from a right hip strain, and his return is on the horizon as the team heads to California early next week.\n\nBooker has been out of action since Feb. 19, when he exited against the San Antonio Spurs after suffering a right hip strain midgame. Despite attempting to play through it, he eventually was ruled out and placed on the injured list.\n\nPhoenix has needed Booker’s offensive spark during his absence, losing four of five games in that stretch before a thrilling win over the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday. While the club has shown it is capable of producing and going deep into its bench during Booker’s time away at different points this season, his average 24.7 points per game have been missed — especially in games the Suns could not quite close out.\n\nJan 13, 2026; Miami, Florida, USA; Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker (1) dunks against the Miami Heat during the third quarter at Kaseya Center.

With other key contributors like Dillon Brooks and Jordan Goodwin sidelined for longer periods, Booker’s availability could prove vital during this stretch.\n\nWhile the team has not officially confirmed his status or provided a firm return date, the report indicates his comeback is approaching and that this extended break is giving him valuable time to rest and prepare his body for the final push.\n\nJan 9, 2026; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker (1) controls the ball against New York Knicks guard Jalen Brunson (11) in the first half at Mortgage Matchup Center.

    "fullText": "Michigan left little doubt Saturday night, using an efficient offensive performance and a strong second half to defeat Illinois 84-70.\n\nThe Wolverines shot 53% from the field (31-of-59) and knocked down 14 of 17 free throws, turning a competitive first half into a comfortable double-digit win by the final horn. The final margin was 14, but it wasn't that close. With the victory, Michigan secured the outright regular season Big Ten title and continued to build on what has already been an elite campaign in the Big Ten. Earning a banner was certainly on Michigan's mind tonight, though the focus remained squarely on handling business against a dangerous Illinois squad in their own building.\n\nMichigan led 38-31 at halftime before exploding for 46 points after the break, shooting 60% in the second half. The Wolverines shared the ball effectively, finishing with 15 assists, and controlled the paint with a 42-32 scoring edge inside.\n\nA trio of Wolverines led the offensive charge. Aday Mara scored 19 points on an efficient 8-of-9 shooting while adding five rebounds. Morez Johnson Jr. returned to Illinois where he played last year as a freshman and matched him with 19 points of his own and delivered a double-double, pulling down a game-high 11 rebounds. Yaxel Lendeborg added 16 points and seven boards, including a key three-pointer in the final minutes that pushed Michigan’s lead to 14 and effectively sealed the game. When Michigan's version of a \"Big Three\" plays like this, they are virtually unbeatable.\n\nMichigan’s depth also proved critical. The Wolverines outscored Illinois 20-7 in bench points, getting key contributions from Trey McKenney and others to maintain energy and pace. Michigan led for more than 31 minutes of game time and built its advantage to as many as 21 points in the second half.\n\nIllinois was paced by super freshman Keaton Wagler’s 23 points, while Kylan Boswell added 15 and David Mirkovic chipped in 12 points and 10 rebounds. The Illini shot just 41% from the field and struggled to keep up once Michigan found its rhythm offensively.\n\nThough both teams committed 10 turnovers, Michigan’s efficiency and physicality made the difference. The Wolverines won the rebounding battle 34-30 and converted consistently at the foul line, maintaining control whenever Illinois threatened to close the gap.\n\nIn a season already marked by consistency and poise, Michigan once again looked the part of a Big Ten champion — efficient, balanced and relentless when it matters most.",

    "fullText": "As Cactus League play kicks into full gear, A.J. Preller and his baseball operations crew will have to start narrowing down the list of players who will have a chance at breaking camp with the Major League squad to end Spring Training. With stars heading off to play for their respective countries, here's how Padres camp stands as of Friday evening:\n\nStarting rotation and bench races heat up\n\nStarter Randy Vásquez built off the impressive end to his 2025 season on Friday against the Rockies. He struck out four without allowing a hit through 2 2/3 scoreless frames in San Diego's 3-2 loss to Colorado. Vásquez noticeably made a leap in increasing his fastball velocity last September and has kept it going, sitting 95 to 97 mph in his first Cactus League start.\n\nFormer Cleveland top prospect Triston McKenzie has struggled in his first few innings for the Friars. The hard-throwing righty has shown flashes of the electric stuff he possessed as a farmhand, but has fallen short so far due to lack of command on his pitches. He's given up five earned runs in 2 2/3 innings thus far.\n\nIn 11 at-bats, infielder Jose Miranda has impressed. He's hitting .545 with a 1.615 OPS, two doubles, a home run, and six RBIs. The former Minnesota Twin is competing for a bench spot along with returning veteran Ty France and KBO new-comer Sung-Mun Song.\n\nSuperstars Manny Machado and Fernando Tatis Jr. collected their final at-bats before heading off to join Team Dominican Republic for the World Baseball Classic. Machado collected an RBI on a sacrifice fly on Friday against the Rockies, but had quite an afternoon on Thursday after launching two no-doubt homers, including a grand slam against the Cincinnati Reds.

After missing the entirety of the 2025 campaign due to Tommy John surgery, Musgrove arrived in Peoria with sights set on once again toeing the slab for his native ball club.\n\nHe recorded nine outs after facing 12 batters in a simulated game on Thursday morning, looking exceptionally sharp. Various reports indicate he was reaching up to 95 mph on the fastball, while spinning the slider and sinker with intense movement.\n\nJoe Musgrove pitched three innings and threw 34 pitches in a simulated game today in Peoria. pic.twitter.com/iRMdUh2ca4\n\n— 97.3 The Fan (@973TheFanSD) February 26, 2026\n\nMusgrove's last big league start came in October 2024 against the Atlanta Braves in the National League Wild Card Series. He struck out four and gave up one run across 3 2/3 innings.\n\nFreshly signed Frair Griffin Canning showed positive signs of healing, continuing agility work with Padres strength and conditioning staff. He's also been able to throw in the bullpen while working closely with pitching coach Ruben Niebla. Canning is recovering from a ruptured left achilles injury sustained last June. San Diego expects him to be game ready by early to mid May.\n\nIn non-related Spring Training news, a resolution to the impending sale of the Padres might be nearing a conclusion. On Thursday evening, Kevin Acee of the San Diego Union-Tribune reported that five groups have submitted a first round of bids for the franchise. Among them are José E. Feliciano, Dan Friedkin, and Joe Lacob.\n\nFeliciano, is a businessman whose private equity firm holds a majority share of Premier League club Chelsea F.C. Friedkin, a native San Diegan, also owns the Premier League team Everton F.C., along with several other business ventures. Lacob, the more popular name of the three, is owner of the NBA's Golden State Warriors and has expressed interest in purchasing a Major League franchise, after attempting at acquisitions of the Los Angeles Angels and Athletics.\n\nIntriguingly, The Athletic's Dennis Lin followed by reporting that Vuori CEO Joe Kudla and NFL legend Drew Brees were one of the five groups to bid on the Padres, but later confirmed that they ultimately did not submit a formal offer by Wednesday's deadline. Kudla and Brees have however, expressed interest in with one of the other groups in the bidding process.\n\nPer Sportico, the franchise has an estimated value of $2.31 billion. Industry expectations are for the Seidler family to fetch north of $5 billion once the sale is completed.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City take on Leeds United at Elland Road later today in what looms as another important Premier League fixture for Pep Guardiola’s side. City will be eager to pick up three points today to keep the pressure on Arsenal, but they will face a Leeds United side who can be a handful, especially at home. Daniel Farke’s side pushed City earlier this season when a late Phil Foden goal secured City all three points in a 3-2 City win. Leeds came from 2-nil down at halftime to make it 2-all at the Etihad. Dominic Calvert-Lewin inspired Leeds on that day, and Manchester City know they’ll face a tough test at Elland Road later today.\n\nHere is the latest City injury news and my predicted Manchester City starting eleven for today’s match.\n\nManchester City are getting players back from injury. Josko Gvardiol is the only City player sidelined with a long-term injury. Gvardiol remains out due to a broken leg. Besides Gvardiol, Pep Guardiola almost has a full squad to choose from for today’s match.\n\nMateo Kovacic has been training in recent weeks as he bids to return to the pitch. Kovacic has missed nearly all of this season after having surgery on a troublesome Achilles issue at the end of last season. The Croatian midfielder suffered a setback in his recovery and had to have a second bout of surgery to correct the issue. Kovacic is edging closer to a return but today’s match may come too soon for him.\n\nJeremy Doku has also returned to training. Pep Guardiola told the media yesterday that the dazzling winger is also on the comeback trail. Doku has missed Manchester City’s past six matches and his availability for today’s match against Leeds United remains up in the air at this stage.",

    "fullText": "Newcastle United winger Anthony Gordon has been linked with a big-money move to Arsenal and Manchester United in recent weeks, but manager Eddie Howe isn’t having it.\n\nThe English manager wasted no time shutting down the “irrelevant” speculation and called on his countryman to remain focused heading into the twilight of the campaign.\n\nThe Magpies are set to host Everton at St. James’ Park, looking to turn their woeful Premier League form around.\n\nNewcastle are heading into the game in fine form, having won four of their last five games across all competitions (L1).\n\nBut that’s merely a smokescreen to mask their woeful domestic form. Howe’s side have lost four of their last five Premier League games (W1).\n\nTheir only victory in that horrendous run came in North London when they beat relegation-battling Tottenham Hotspur 2-1.\n\nGiven what’s at stake, Howe wants all his players pulling in the same direction as they look to turn things around, so speculation linking Gordon with a summer exit does Newcastle no good.\n\nReports claim Arsenal are leading the race for the England international, who is set to welcome his former employers to Tyneside.\n\nHowe has admitted that he can do little to stop the rumours, but made it clear that the timing makes them little more than background noise.\n\n“I’m not sure there’s a lot I can do about that,” Howe said during his pre-match press conference. “I’ve not seen the story, so it’s news to me.\n\n“But we’re mid-season, we’re in the middle of some of the biggest games of his career, and who knows what’s going to happen internationally with Anthony in the summer as well.\n\n“He’s not got time to look left or right. He’s got to be fully focused on straight ahead and the next game, and trying to be as good as he can be.”\n\nWhen asked if he’s concerned that such rumours could affect Gordon, Howe said: “I think it’s irrelevant really. It’s how the players take to that.\n\n“If the players absorb it and it affects them, then of course that’s a negative. But I think they will become robust enough to ignore it and concentrate on playing.”\n\nGordon is the latest Newcastle star linked with a move to Arsenal. The Gunners have also been linked with Sandro Tonali, who is admired by Man United.",

    "fullText": "There is a hole in our Universe!\n\nThere are in fact, many holes that we know of, they account for around 80% of the known Universe.\n\nOur own Milky Way galaxy lies in a void called the KBC Void, or Local Hole. However, none is as big as the Boötes supervoid.\n\nSometimes called 'The Great Nothing' or Great Void, the Boötes Void is a spherical area 700 lightyears from Earth in the constellation Boötes, the herdsman who pushes the plough in Ursa Major eternally around the polestar Polaris.\n\nThe Boötes void spans an area 330 million lightyears across but contains very few galaxies, making it the largest such void in the known Universe.\n\nThis huge expanse contains just 60 or so galaxies, all in a tube-shaped region that lies across the middle of the void.\n\nWe would normally expect there to be around 2,000 galaxies in an area of the same size.\n\nIt is surrounded by the Ursa Major, Shapley, Hercules, Corona-Borealis and Boötes superclusters.\n\nWhen the universe first formed, the matter it contained was densely packed and thought to be fairly uniform, but quantum fluctuations within caused some areas of matter to become slightly more densely packed.\n\nDenser areas collapsed under gravity more rapidly, pulling more matter from the less dense areas.\n\nAs the Universe expanded, these small, dense areas grew with it and began to clump together to form galaxies, which also attracted each other, eventually forming a giant foam-like web of filaments across the universe.\n\nThese filaments and voids are the largest structures in the known Universe, formed by clusters and clots of galaxies as they converge.\n\nThe voids formed the gaps between them, like bubbles in foam.\n\nSmaller bubbles merged to form larger voids. Together, voids and filaments dominate the overall structure of the Universe.\n\nFilaments give off more energy, and so are hotter areas than the empty, colder voids.\n\nVoids and superclusters were first identified in the mid 1970s when redshift surveys were used to map the universe in 3D.\n\nThe Boötes Void was discovered in 1981 by the American astronomer Robert Kirshner from the University of Michigan.\n\nDuring a survey of galaxy redshifts to create a 3D map of the universe, Kirshner and his team discovered a huge blank region.\n\nThe size of the void and the fact we know it does contain some, though very few, galaxies, rules out the possibility of the Boötes Void being a black hole.\n\nComparisons with Barnard 68 also rule out it being a dark nebula, which are molecular clouds so dense that they obscure visible light, masking the objects behind them.\n\nVoids are also great places to study neutrinos that freely stream across them.\n\nIt is hoped that missions like the Euclid satellite will be able to compare neutrino samples in voids with theoretical predictions to measure the sum of the masses of all species of neutrino.",

    "description": "The era of The Bespoke Flywheel is here: agentic coding has pushed the cost of disposable, one-off software to zero. Stop settling for generic tools and start automating away niche friction to keep your focus entirely on high-signal thinking.",
    "fullText": "Every researcher or engineer has encountered this: you need to do something ad-hoc and unsupported by existing tooling. Perhaps it's to create a custom slice of data analysis, to build a dashboard that monitors a specific failure pattern, or simply to make a nicer-looking UI that doesn't hurt your eyes so much when eyeballing eval samples. You look at the clock and the massive to-do list, think about the efforts needed, and decide that you cannot justify the investment. So you settle for a generic tool that gives you a blurry version of the truth.\n\nBut this is changing as we enter the era of The Bespoke Flywheel. Before we know it, the cost of building niche, disposable software will effectively hit zero.\n\nWe used to only build tools for the 80% case -- problems that happen frequent enough to justify the engineering overhead. This left the long tail of friction untouched. The frontier, however, by definition lives in that long tail. It is made of weird, non-standardized, one-off problems that off-the-shelf tools can't solve.\n\nWith agentic coding tools, the math has flipped. When you can describe a friction point and have a working solution in 2 minutes, the Tooling Tax vanishes. You stop working around the friction and start automating it out of existence.\n\nThis allows you to build Disposable Software: tools built for a single niche purpose, used for three hours (or even only 10 minutes) to find a specific signal, and then discarded.\n\nThe true power of this shift is best understood through a lens recently articulated by Hao Sheng:\n\n\"The bottleneck is how fast you can convert an idea into a high-signal datapoint — and then do it again.\"\n\nIn this framework, progress isn't limited by compute or idea supply. It's limited by the velocity of the feedback loop.\n\nWhen you combine agentic coding with this philosophy, you get The Bespoke Flywheel:\n\nFor the first time, your progress is no longer limited by your ability to quickly churn out throw-away code. It is limited only by your cognitive bandwidth: asking the right questions and interpreting the high-signal data coming back at you.\n\nWe used to spend 80% of our time building the machine and 20% of our time thinking. The Bespoke Flywheel flips that ratio and keeps you in a flow state longer.\n\nThis shift goes way beyond AI labs and tech companies; it's the new baseline for the personal frontier. We are moving from a world where we adapt our lives to generic software, to one where we architect the digital environment to fit us.\n\nThe Bespoke Flywheel becomes a way of living. Whether you are optimizing a personal health journey, mastering a niche hobby, or managing a complex househould, you no longer need to wait for an app developer to care about your specific friction. You build the bridge yourself.\n\nThe frontier is now personal. And it's yours to build.\n\nGenerative AI Usage Disclosure: Refined by Gemini 3 Thinking; banner generated by Nano Banana 2.",

    "fullText": "While everyone has been going crazy over vibe-coding, I’ve been largely experimenting with AI for learning.\n\nThe question I generally have is whether or not we can use these tools to learn\nnew technical concepts, domains, or programming languages effectively.\n\nThe hardest part when programming, in my opinon, usually has very little to do\nwith the syntax and much more to do with the domain.\n\nHow does authentication\nwork? What is a database “transaction”? What is a language server? What happens\nin the linking process?\n\nOr, if you’re learning a new programming paradigm (e.g. Rust, FP, Lisp), you likely have some\nquestions about the idiomatic way to do things.\n\nI’ve been playing around with these tools for a good while attempting to do some\nof these things, with the focus on using them to actually improve my knowledge\nrather than mercilessly vibecoding.\n\nSo, can these tools help us learn effectively? To immediately ruin the clickbait, my honest answer is I’m still trying to work that out myself.\n\nBut I think sharing my thoughts here might be useful to some others.\n\nFirst I want to talk about my general approach to learning, applying it to AI,\nand then where I think things fall short - whether through the tools, or my own\nlearning strategy.\n\nAs a self-learner, I believe the strongest path you can choose to take is inquiry-based learning. This is especially true for areas like programming, computing-related concepts, etc.\n\nThe general idea is to learn by creating projects and asking lots of questions about what you’re doing. What happens if I change X variable to Y? Why does it give me an error? What does the error mean?\n\nAnd using this to form your own beliefs and understandings about a concept, and testing them (either by learning more, consulting experienced people on forums, etc.).\n\nThis is kind of similar to the Socratic method and other techniques to help improve your critical thinking.\n\nThe obvious next step here is trying to apply this concept to our LLM usage.\n\nSocrates and many other teachers over the course of modern and ancient history seem to agree on the fact that you need some amount of discomfort in order to learn effectively.\n\nTo be honest it really is as simple as the common phrase “learning from your mistakes”.\n\nIf you break a client’s website or run into a bug which drives you insane for 3 days, you’re probably never going to make that mistake again because, well, you don’t want to experience that mistake again.\n\nAlong these lines, if you’re tackling something new or complex (or both) it’s of course natural to feel a level of discomfort as it’s unknown, and you will likely make mistakes (and learn from them).\n\nSo with all of this said, this is where I want to talk about AI.\n\nI have taken this inquiry-based approach when learning new topics and using LLMs.\n\nThere is no “master” strategy here. I always feel I work best by trusting my instincts when it comes to what I should learn next or upskill with.\n\nBut here’s a few different approaches I took:\n\nThe least effective way to learn with LLMs, in my opinion, is to use only LLMs. I’m sure you could ask the chatbot to act like a teacher and teach you a lesson on topic X, but I think it’s not making the most of the chat format. We need diagrams, videos, and other methods of written explanation that do not fit the “voice” given to the current AI models.\n\nHowever, using them alongside other resources, or as a fellow code reviewer, assistant, or something along these lines, seems to have given me some remarkable results - at least output-wise.\n\nI’ve recently been coding Neovim plugins by reading the documentation the best I can, and using AI to help me if I get stuck on how a certain API works or what I’m doing wrong.\n\nI think the issue is though it makes me think two things:\n\nComing back to the point I made earlier, we need discomfort to learn. The “goldilocks” zone of not too much, not too little, but just right.\n\nRight now, I feel at least that AI makes things just a little bit too easy for me. So I have to ask myself: am I really still learning effectively? Am I destroying my critical thinking and offloading too much to these tools?\n\nI want to think that I’m not, considering that I have the mental capability to reflect on this experience and try and decide for myself. But it does make me think.\n\nThese tools are all about how we use them. You can generate slop short-form media, or you can try and use them to learn new concepts. It’s all about you. But having the discipline to use them in a “good” way is definitely hard.\n\nI do think we’re moving closer to the goldilocks zone, and I can really see these tools augmenting our learning process for the better.\n\nAt the same time, I don’t want to see traditional resources fade away, and I do think there’s room for both. Or, at least I hope there is.\n\nIf you have any thoughts on this I’d be glad to hear them.",

You can see how many days you have left for testing under the app name in TestFlight. TestFlight will notify you each time a new build is available and will include instructions on what you need to test. Alternatively, with TestFlight 3 or later, you can turn on automatic updates to have the latest beta builds install automatically.\n\nWhen the testing period is over, you'll no longer be able to open the beta build. To install the App Store version of the app, download or purchase the app from the App Store. In-app purchases are free only during beta testing, and any in-app purchases made during testing will not carry over to App Store versions.\n\nNote: To automatically download additional in-app content and assets, such as Apple-Hosted Background Assets and Managed Background Assets after a beta app is installed, ensure the In-App Content or Automatically download in-app content option is enabled in your App Store settings for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Vision Pro\n\nApple-Hosted Background Assets: Devices must be running iOS/iPadOS 26 or later, and macOS 26 or later.\n\nManaged Background Assets: Devices must be running iOS/iPadOS 16 or later, macOS 13 or later, tvOS 18.5 or later, and visionOS 2.4 or later.\n\nTo get started, install TestFlight on the device you’ll use for testing. Then, accept your email invitation or follow the public link invitation to install the beta app. The public link invitation will include a description of the beta app and may also include screenshots, the app category, and criteria you must meet to join the beta. You can install the beta app on up to 30 devices.\n\nIf you do not meet the tester criteria, the beta invitation will inform you that the developer requires you to test with a specific device and OS when you tap or click Learn More on the beta invitation. If you have a device that meets the critiera, you can install TestFlight on the device and then accept the beta invitation.\n\nKeep in mind that you can accept an invitation on a non-preferred device as long as you have a device associated with TestFlight that meets the criteria set by the developer.\n\nIf you do not wish to accept an invitation, you can easily give feedback to help the developer by letting them know why.\n\nNote: When testing your app's subscriptions in TestFlight, the renewal rate is accelerated. Each subscription is renewed daily, up to 6 times within a one-week period, regardless of the subscription's duration.\n\nNote: If a compatible build is available for your device, an Install button will appear, allowing you to accept the invitation and install the compatible build.\n\nIf you’re a returning tester, tap Update or Open.\n\nNote: If a compatible build is available for your device, an Install button will appear, allowing you to accept the invitation and install the compatible build.\n\nIf you’re a returning tester, click Update or Open.\n\nNote: If a compatible build is available for your device, an Install button will appear, allowing you to accept the invitation and install the compatible build\n\nIf you’re a returning tester, touch Update or Open.\n\nIf you’re testing an iOS app that includes an iMessage app, launch the beta app from the Home Screen.\n\nIf you’re testing an app that’s for iMessage only or a sticker pack, launch it from within Messages.\n\nAfter accepting your email or public link invitation to test the app, you’ll see the option to test the App Clip in TestFlight. You can install either the app or the App Clip on your device (but not both at once), and can replace one with the other at any time. If the app is installed on your device, testing the App Clip will replace the app and some app data may be lost. You can reinstall the app by tapping Install on the app’s page in TestFlight.\n\nNote: If a compatible build is available for your device, an Install button will appear, allowing you to accept the invitation and install the compatible build.\n\nIf you’re a returning tester, tap Update or Open.\n\nAfter installing TestFlight 3 or later for iOS, iPadOS, or tvOS, TestFlight for visionOS, or TestFlight for macOS, you’ll be prompted to turn on automatic updates. This allows the latest available beta builds to install automatically. TestFlight will notify you each time a new build is installed on your device. Automatic updates can be turned off at any time.\n\nUse TestFlight to change automatic update settings for all of the beta apps you’re testing using TestFlight:\n\nNote: This setting will apply to all new beta app builds. Beta apps that have automatic updates set at the individual app level won’t be affected\n\nUse TestFlight to change automatic update settings for individual beta apps you’re testing:\n\nWhen viewing an app in TestFlight, you'll see the latest available build by default. You can still test all other builds that are available to you.\n\nIf you already have the App Store version of the app installed on your device, the beta version of the app will replace it. After you download the beta app, you’ll see an orange dot next to its name that identifies it as a beta.\n\nWhen you accept a TestFlight invitation through a public link, your name and email address aren’t visible to the developer. However, they’ll be able to see your number of sessions and crashes, the day you installed their app, and the latest installed version.\n\nWhile testing a beta version of an app or App Clip, you can send the developer feedback about issues you experience or make suggestions for improvements based on the “What to Test” content. Feedback you submit through TestFlight is also provided to Apple as part of the TestFlight service.\n\nIf you do not wish to accept a public link invitation, you can easily provide feedback to let the developer know why. After dismissing the beta invitation, you’ll see the Leave Feedback card at the top of the Apps page. Tap or click Leave Feedback, select your reason for declining from the list, and then tap or click Submit. Once you receive confirmation that your feedback has been sent, tap or click Done.\n\nYou can send feedback through the TestFlight app or directly from the beta app or beta App Clip by taking a screenshot, and you can report a crash after it occurs. If you were invited to test an app with a public link, you can choose not to provide your email address or other personal information to the developer. Apple will also receive all feedback you submit and will be able to tie it to your Apple Account.\n\nIf your device is running an OS earlier than iOS 13 or iPadOS 13, tap Send Beta Feedback to compose an email to the developer. The feedback email contains detailed information about the beta app and about your iOS device. You can also provide additional information, such as necessary screenshots and steps required to reproduce any issues. Your email address will be visible to the developer when you send email feedback through the TestFlight app even if you were invited through a public link.\n\nNote: You can drag and drop screenshots into the feedback text field.\n\nIf you experience a crash while testing a beta app or beta App Clip, you’ll receive an alert asking if you want to send crash details to the developer through TestFlight. Developers can opt out of receiving this type of feedback, so this option is only available if the developer has it enabled.\n\nWhen a crash alert displays for TestFlight for iOS or iPadOS, tap Share, add any additional comments, then tap Submit.\n\nWhen a crash alert displays for TestFlight for macOS, click Report, add any additional comments, then click OK, Send, or Reopen.\n\nWhen a crash alert displays for TestFlight for visionOS, touch Share, add any additional comments, then pinch Submit.\n\nTo provide feedback on a tvOS app, open TestFlight, go to app’s page, go to the Information section to view the developer's email address, and send them an email. Provide as much information as you can, including screenshots and steps required to reproduce any issues you encountered. Please note that your email address will be visible to the developer when you send email feedback through TestFlight.\n\nIf you need to contact the developer while you’re testing their beta app for reasons other than feedback, you can view their email address. In TestFlight, go to the app’s page, go to the Information section, and tap App Details to view the developer’s email address.\n\nIf you don’t accept your email invitation, the beta app won’t be installed, you won’t be listed as a tester, and Apple won’t take any action with respect to your email address. Additionally, you can unsubscribe using the link at the bottom of the invitation email to notify the developer that you’d like to be removed from their list. If you accepted the invitation and no longer wish to test the app, you can delete yourself as a tester by visiting the app’s Information page in TestFlight and tapping Stop Testing.\n\nWhen you test beta apps or beta App Clips with TestFlight, Apple will collect and send crash logs, your personal information such as name and email address, usage information, and any feedback you submit to the developer. Information that is emailed to the developer directly is not shared with Apple. The developer is permitted to use this information only to improve their App and is not permitted to share it with a third party. Apple may use this information to improve the TestFlight app and detect and prevent fraud.",

    "fullText": "Mountain photographer stumbles on one of the largest ever collections of Triassic dinosaur prints\n\nA newfound site in the Italian Alps holds one of the largest collections of Triassic dinosaur footprints ever seen\n\nJoin Our Community of Science Lovers!\n\nLast September photographer Elio Della Ferrera spotted thousands of dinosaur tracks traversing vertical rock faces in the Fraele Valley of Stelvio National Park, high in the Italian Alps. Some of the prints, spanning as many as 40 centimeters across, date back about 210 million years, making the newly identified site one of the richest deposits of Triassic dinosaur tracks in the world.\n\nThe footprints are so well preserved that “it took me a few seconds to realize the photos were real,” says paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso of the Natural History Museum of Milan, who is leading the investigation of the site. “Now we can go back in time and study the evolution of dinosaurs in this place.”\n\nIn a preliminary study, Dal Sasso and his team deduced that the prints were made by herds of large, herbivorous dinosaurs, probably prosauropods, ancestors of Jurassic sauropods such as Brontosaurus. The tracks formed when dinosaurs walked across muddy tidal flats along the shores of the prehistoric Tethys Ocean, long before the Alps rose.\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

    "fullText": "In the early 2010s, after “nano” and before “AI”, 3D printing was the technology that was going to change everything. Then it seemed to go quiet except for guns.\n\n“First we will gain control over the shape of physical things. Then we will gain new levels of control over their composition, the materials they’re made of. Finally, we will gain control over the behavior of physical things,” Hod Lipson and Melba Kurman wrote in their 2013 book, Fabricated. As far as I can tell, we’re still pretty much in the era of making physical things that could be made by traditional methods rather than weird new shapes that could *only* be produced by additive manufacturing. More than 15 years after a fellow technology conference attendee excitedly lectured me that 3D printing was going to change everything, its growth remains largely hidden from most of us.\n\nUntil this past week, when I attended an event awash in puzzle makers and discovered that it’s been a godsend to them for making not only prototypes but also small runs of copies or published designs, freeing them from having to find space and capital for the kind of quantities required by traditional production. It’s good to see a formerly hyped technology supporting clever and entertaining human invention.\n\nIn one of the biggest fines in its history, the UK Information Commissioner’s Office has announced it is fining Reddit £14.5 million for failing to put in place an effective age verification mechanism to block under-13s from using the site under Reddit’s stated terms of service. The story is somewhat confused by timing: the fine is under data protection law and relates to the period before the arrival of the Online Safety Act, but the OSA’s requirement for age verification brought the changes that sparked the fine. Reddit says it will appeal.\n\nIn the UK terms and conditions Reddit announced in June 2025, the company says that “by using the services, you state that…you are at least 13 years old”. But Reddit didn’t require proof, and the ICO says that many under-13s use(d) the platform.\n\nIn July, when the Online Safety Act came into effect, Reddit added an age gate of 18 for “mature” content. Unlike many other social media sites that are just giant pools of content sorted by curation or algorithm, Reddit is a large set of distinct subReddits. Each of these communities has its own rules, social norms, and, most important, human moderators. Because of this, it’s comparatively easy to mark a particular subReddit as “for adults only”. After the July change, anyone in the UK wishing to access one of those subReddits was asked to submit a selfie or an image of a government-issued ID in order to prove their age.\n\nThe ICO’s findings state that Reddit failed to protect under-13s from accessing content that placed them at risk; that it processed under-13s’ data unlawfully (because they are too young to meaningfully consent); and that a simple statement is not a sufficient age verification mechanism (which is made clear in the OSA).\n\nA Reddit spokesperson told the Guardian: “The ICO’s insistence that we collect more private information on every UK user is counterintuitive and at odds with our strong belief in our users’ online privacy and safety.”\n\nI take their point; I’d rather skip the “mature” content than bear the privacy risk of uploading personal data to whatever third-party company Reddit is using for age verification. Last July, I decided I would just be a child. (Although: my Reddit account dates to 2015, so they could just do the math.)\n\nTurns out, it may have been a wise decision. Reddit, saying it didn’t want to hold users’ personal data, chose the age verification provider Persona.\n\nPersona deserves a look. Last week, Discord announced it would begin treating all users as teens until they’d been verified, also using Persona. The result as Ashley Belanger reports at Ars Technica was a user backlash. First, because last time Discord tried this, its now-former age verification provider’s pile of 70,000 users’ age check information was hacked.\n\nSecond, because The Rage reports that a group of security researchers found a Persona front end exposed to the open Internet on a US government server. On examination, that code shows that Persona performs 269 different verification checks and scours the Internet and government sources using your selfie and facial recognition. Discord has now announced it will delay introducing age verification – and won’t be using Persona after an apparently unsatisfactory trial in the UK last year.In a blog posting, Discord says that, like Reddit, it does not want to know its users’ identification details. It is adding more verification options.\n\nIf the world had already had a set of established trustworthy companies that specialized in age verification when the OSA came into effect, then it would make sense to turn to them to provide that service. But we aren’t in that situation. Instead, although providers have been working for more than a decade to build such systems, their deployment at scale is new.\n\nPart of keeping children – and the rest of us – safe is protecting security and privacy – and child safety campaigners’ refusal to accept this has been an issue for decades. Creating new privacy risks doesn’t keep anyone safer – including children.\n\nIllustrations: Six-panel early 1970s cartoon strip, “What the User Wanted”.\n\nWendy M.

    "description": "The Ukrainian navy released the footage on Thursday, saying the helicopter crew had destroyed eight Shahed and Gerbera drones in a single day.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine released footage on Thursday of a helicopter crew destroying multiple Russian drones.\n\nIt's an extended look at how Ukraine is deploying chopper-mounted machine guns to fight Shaheds.\n\nThe clips show the chopper crew using thermal cameras and an M134 minigun to hunt down the drones.\n\nUkraine just gave us an extended look at one of its emerging tactics against Russia's Shaheds: using helicopters to shoot the drones from above.\n\nThe Ukrainian navy published a two-minute montage of such operations on Thursday, saying that a helicopter crew had destroyed eight Shahed exploding drones and Gerbera decoy drones in a single day.\n\nCockpit and gun camera footage showed the Ukrainians engaging at least five delta-wing drones in flight, with another clip showing unidentified wreckage smoking on the ground.\n\nSome clips indicate that at least one aerial engagement happened in the early morning or at night. Thermal footage from a gun camera showed the operator firing at a delta-wing drone, tracking its flight above open terrain before a screen flash indicates the drone was destroyed.\n\nOther standard optical footage, filmed from a gun camera or the cockpit, appears to show several drones being destroyed high above the clouds or over water near a coastal settlement.\n\nAdditionally, an M134 minigun can be seen mounted from a helicopter's side door, though the videos didn't show the weapon itself in action.\n\nDuring today’s massive Russian attack, a Ukrainian naval aviation helicopter crew destroyed 8 Shahed/Gerbera drones.\n\n📹: @UA_NAVY pic.twitter.com/CO2IFtNkCg\n\n— Defense of Ukraine (@DefenceU) February 26, 2026\n\nThe clips indicate some of the ideal conditions for downing a Shahed.\n\nFor one, the helicopter has to match the drone's speed and trajectory and gain enough altitude to allow the minigun to fire downward at the Shahed. The chopper crew also needs to come within visual range of the drone to engage.\n\nThe footage comes several months after Ukraine said it would officially begin incorporating helicopter crews into its air defense network against Russia's one-way attack drones, which Moscow uses in mass waves to pressure Ukrainian cities.\n\nBecause Russia mass-produces the Shahed and Gerbera, Kyiv has sought more inexpensive means, such as machine guns, instead of traditional antiaircraft missiles to counter them.\n\nUkraine's commander in chief, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said in October that helicopters could sometimes destroy up to 40% of Russian Shaheds and Gerberas in one area.\n\nThermal and infrared cameras, such as the one seen in the latest footage, were among the systems that Syrskyi said would be equipped on such helicopters to improve their effectiveness.\n\nUkraine also uses ground crews with interceptor drones or truck-mounted machine guns to destroy Shaheds, but a helicopter crew can reposition much faster to engage multiple threats or hunt down a Russian drone that changes its flight trajectory.\n\nThe latter scenario became increasingly common as Russia was found to be outfitting Shaheds with more advanced communications and guidance systems, and, in rare cases, artificial intelligence.\n\nHelicopters also allow for engagements at higher altitudes. Russia often directs its Shaheds to approach their targets at above 6,500 feet before swooping down to attack, making it more difficult for ground-based crews to hit the drones.\n\nAside from helicopters, Ukrainian troops have also been seen using M134 miniguns on turboprop planes to shoot down Shaheds.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia has since been reported to be attempting to counter the Ukrainian helicopters by equipping its Shaheds with R-60 air-to-air missiles.\n\nIn November, Ukraine's deputy minister of defense for innovation told Business Insider's Jake Epstein that Moscow was also directly targeting patrolling helicopters and aircraft with Shaheds.",

The following year, after her parents divorced, he asked for $5,000 in cash to step away from the arrangement. Tiffany declined. He then filed a $20,000 lien against the property.\n\nThe ‘ChatGPT of Marketing' Just Opened a $0.85/Share Round — 10,000+ Investors Are Already In\n\nThis Energy Storage Company Already Has $185M in Contracts—Shares Are Still Available\n\nThe house is worth about $63,000, with roughly $17,000 remaining on the mortgage. Tiffany said they have tried three times to pay him, offering $5,000 and $10,000, but he refused because he would have to split the money with her mother. The lien has prevented them from selling the home.\n\n\"Confessions of someone who should not have bought real estate in a partnership,\" host Dave Ramsey said.\n\nTiffany said her household income is about $150,000 and her net worth is around $500,000. Ramsey outlined two possible paths.\n\nFirst, she could hire an attorney and sue for dissolution of the partnership. A judge could order the property sold and address the $20,000 lien. The legal route, he said, could cost $10,000 to $15,000 and would likely end her relationship with her father.\n\n\"That would be justice,\" Ramsey said.\n\nTrending: Own the Characters, Not Just the Content: Inside a Fast-Growing Pre-IPO IP Company\n\nMeanwhile, co-host Kristina Ellis asked, \"What's happening with the house right now? Are you guys renting it? Is it sitting vacant?\"\n\nTiffany said the home is rented and generates about $1,000 per month. After legal fees and a forced sale, Ramsey said she might net roughly $10,000 to $20,000.\n\nBefore learning who held title to the property, Ramsey offered another option.\n\n\"Just walk away. Just toss the keys over your shoulder,\" he said.\n\nRamsey said given her income and net worth, he would pay off the remaining mortgage, sign a quit claim deed to her parents and let them sort it out.\n\nSee Also: This Under-$1 Pre-IPO AI Company Is Still Open to Retail Investors — Learn More\n\nHowever, Tiffany clarified that only she and her husband are listed on the deed and mortgage because her parents were in Chapter 13 bankruptcy at the time of purchase. She added that an Illinois law that took effect in 2023 permits certain expired liens, including one that lapsed in 2018, to be removed without involving the person who filed them.",

    "fullText": "When you think of a typical Costco member, you probably picture someone like me: an overworked, perpetually tired suburban mom with a house full of hungry people to feed.\n\nBut Costco actually caters to shoppers across a range of demographics — and incomes.\n\nBudget-conscious shoppers like Costco for the bulk savings and are therefore willing to stretch a bit to cover the store's membership fees. Average earners like Costco for the great deals and can generally afford the cost of access. And higher earners tend to appreciate Costco's eclectic array of products.\n\nIn fact, it's members with more wiggle room in their budgets who are best suited to take advantage of Costco's famous treasure hunt-style shopping experience.\n\nDuring Costco's Q3 2024 earnings call, CEO Ron Vachris talked about how important that element is to the company.\n\n\"We never want to compromise the treasure hunt of Costco,\" he said.\n\nCostco is a company that knows its audience well. As such, it tends to open new warehouse club stores in, or just outside of, suburban areas.\n\nFinding room to build a Costco store can be a challenge due to its giant footprint. But now, Costco is building a whole new type of store that could attract a whole new type of customer.\n\nCostco is building a warehouse club store in South Los Angeles, located directly beneath an affordable housing complex. The project, located in Baldwin Village, is expected to include 800 apartment units, almost 25% of which are reserved for low-income residents, Fox reported.\n\nThe development is expected to open in 2027.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom praised the initiative, calling it \"an incredible collaboration that uses our new state laws to transform an underutilized space into a prosperous housing project and retail center.\"\n\nThis development will not only be the first in the U.S. to use Costco as an anchor tenant for a mixed-use housing project, but will also create up to 400 permanent jobs, not to mention many more during the construction phase.\n\nIn addition, by serving as an anchor tenant for the complex, Costco is making itself easily accessible to the residents who end up living there. That could drive more shoppers to the store.\n\nCostco's foray into a mixed-use development is a smart idea in theory. But due to the nature of the development and where it's opening, the results could be mixed.",

    "description": "Laid-off Block employees say they were embracing AI tools in what one called an almost \"celebratory\" way. Then it replaced them.",
    "fullText": "In the months before Block CEO Jack Dorsey laid off 40% of staff on Thursday, workers were embracing AI tools in what one called an almost \"celebratory\" way.\n\nDorsey and other company leaders had made no secret of their interest in AI, but the company was profitable, and some workers couldn't imagine the technology fully replacing humans at scale any time soon, they told Business Insider.\n\nStill, there were pockets of unease. Block, the parent company of financial tech firms including Cash App and Square, had executed a series of smaller performance-based cuts in previous months. At least one employee said he'd had a nagging feeling that the AI tools he was using had gotten really good.\n\n\"I had a hunch that, at some point, the company would cut people because of AI. I just didn't think it would be right now,\" Ivan Ureña-Valdes, a data analyst who was laid off after four years at Block, told Business Insider.\n\nWhen Dorsey dropped the hammer via a memo posted on X, he said AI was the reason 4,000 workers were losing their jobs.\n\n\"A significantly smaller team using the tools we're building can do more and do it better,\" Dorsey told analysts on Block's earnings call on Thursday following the news.\n\nTwo hours after the layoff announcement, Dorsey logged onto a video call with the calendar title \"gratitude,\" sporting a baseball cap that said \"love\" to address the staff.\n\nAs he spoke with employees about Block's layoffs and his reasoning for the deep cuts, some sent comments thanking him for the opportunity to work at the company. One asked if his hat was appropriate given the context. Dorsey answered that it was about gratitude.\n\nThroughout the meeting, he was flooded with waves of emojis from muted participants, three attendees told Business Insider. Popular reactions were the thumbs-down, thinking face, and crying-laughing emojis, two people said. Dorsey explained the cuts in his trademark monotone and said he was doing what's best for the company.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to seven former Block employees about the internal push to use AI in the last year; many said they were happy to oblige. Some were laid off on Thursday; others lost their jobs in recent performance-based cuts. Though they adopted AI tools to varying degrees, they view the technology as unable, at the moment, to do all the jobs of the thousands of workers who were let go. So it came as a shock to see half the company chopped in one fell swoop.\n\nWhile some in the tech world expressed skepticism that AI was the true impetus for the cuts, suggesting that Dorsey had bloated Block's ranks, others saw it as the first wave in a coming tsunami of job cuts across the industry. The alarm over a potential white-collar jobs apocalypse has gotten louder in recent months. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has signaled that AI could lead to white-collar job cuts at the company. Last year, Salesforce made cuts to its customer support team, thanks to the use of AI agents, CEO Marc Benioff said.\n\nBlock's layoffs are so large in scope and more pointedly attributed to AI than most that they added fuel to a fear sweeping the white-collar world: AI is coming for your job, and learning to use it isn't enough to save you.\n\n\"I've seen a lot of public commentary about this layoff and how workers need to be using AI to protect our jobs,\" said one nontechnical worker laid off on Thursday. \"I was actively building with AI and know that many of my impacted colleagues were doing the same.\"\n\nDorsey has planted a flag in painting Block as an AI-forward company. He said on Thursday's earnings call that Block was \"one of the first to harness agentic capabilities.\" And in July, Dorsey made headlines for using an internal coding tool called Goose to vibecode a \"weekend project\" that led to the messaging app Bitchat.\n\nInvestors appeared to favor Dorsey's narrative of cutting costs with AI: After being down roughly 16% year to date before the layoffs, Block's stock ended Friday up nearly 17% on the day.\n\n\"Jack loves AI and was constantly pushing us to use it,\" Ureña-Valdes said. \"I got to use these tools as much as possible every single day.\"\n\nHe said he'd \"felt the rumblings of AI disruption for a while\" because he was using it in his work and noticed the tools were getting better.\n\nOne former software engineer said that Block had many internal AI demos and that her coworkers' feelings about AI were \"mostly celebratory.\"\n\nAnother former software engineer let go during performance cuts earlier in February said the company had warned that output expectations for engineers would increase. He said the company's head of engineering voiced productivity expectations that left them worried quality would suffer. After this week's layoffs, his team shrank from eight engineers to one.\n\nOne employee laid off on Thursday said she had embraced AI at Block, but saw that it required human oversight. The day before the layoffs, she said, she caught errors in a company chatbot. She said the cuts surprised her manager, who was spared from the layoffs. The two sat together and cried it out.\n\nSeveral researchers and former Block employees say they're skeptical about AI's actual role in the layoffs.\n\n\"Block must have uncovered a secret sauce, perhaps within the software development process, to claim all of these jobs are AI-related,\" said Jason Schloetzer, a business professor at Georgetown's McDonough School of Business. \"From the dozens of executives across industries that I've spoken with about AI deployment, they certainly aren't seeing these types of gains outside of the software development process.\"\n\nOn Thursday's earnings call, Dorsey said there has been a marked improvement in AI's capabilities and that \"Block wanted to get ahead of this shift rather than be forced into it reactively.\"\n\n\"The models just got an order of magnitude more capable and more intelligent,\" Dorsey said. \"And it's really shown a path forward in terms of us being able to apply it to nearly every single thing that we do.\"\n\nSome former Block employees, as well as others in the industry, said pandemic overhiring, rather than AI, spurred the layoffs — a common refrain for Big Tech in recent years.\n\n\"Over the course of my time at Block, leadership did repeatedly signal the need for a 'smaller Block,'\" the laid-off nontechnical worker, who worked at Block for two years, said.\n\nCompanies like Block are conducting layoffs \"with a chainsaw, not a scalpel,\" said Chris Kaufman, a leadership consultant in Detroit.\n\n\"They're not conducting audits of who took an AI course,\" Kaufman said. \"They're making macro decisions about cost structure and organizational design. That's usually just looking at headcount and salary across the board.\"\n\nBeing AI savvy, Kaufman said, \"can increase productivity, but I don't think it is any way layoff insurance.\"\n\nDanielle Bell, a business communications professor at Northwestern University, said it's obvious the workforce — both inside Block and out — is worried about AI. \"If this is the new reality that we're in, executives need to be more honest with themselves, with stakeholders, with the board, Wall Street, and particularly employees about what AI is here to do.\"\n\nWhatever the reason, one of the engineers cut on Thursday said there was a feeling in the air that something was coming. This engineer said she noticed that performance reviews were moved up from their February start. She thought she was safe after the earlier performance-based cuts — until she was laid off on Thursday.\n\n\"People were tense, even after good news would come through,\" she said. \"Lots of rumors flying around the office in person.\"",

    "title": "Burger King's Whopper upgrade is a high-stakes bet on premiumization",
    "description": "Burger King announced on Thursday that it will \"elevate\" its iconic Whopper burger with a premium bun and better mayonnaise.",
    "fullText": "Burger King is tweaking its Whopper — and the changes don't just freshen a decades-old recipe; they also reposition its flagship product as part of the fast-food industry's broader premiumization push amid years of value wars.\n\nThe chain is betting that highly visible upgrades — including what a press release described as \"a more premium, better tasting bun,\" and packaging designed to prevent the dreaded squish — can compete against its fellow quick-service restaurants as diners increasingly demand both quality and value.\n\nThe changes mark the first meaningful refresh of the Whopper in nearly a decade and came as a response to a campaign that allowed customers to call or text Burger King US and Canada president Tom Curtis directly.\n\nCurtis heard those calls and told Business Insider the company received nearly 20,000 voicemails and texts, with the Whopper \"consistently one of the top topics,\" underscoring how central it remains to the brand's identity.\n\nThe fast-food industry has been locked in an intense value war that has intensified since the summer of 2024 as inflation and economic pressures pushed consumers to seek the lowest-priced options. However, as chains lean into discounts, they also face a ceiling: consistently cutting prices can erode margins and dull brand appeal.\n\nIn response, competitors have begun pushing premium upgrades to core menu items.\n\nMcDonald's has tweaked its burgers — with changes like cooking patties in smaller batches, glaze-like sauces, and richer buns — as part of its broader menu refresh and McValue strategy. Taco Bell's Luxe Cravings boxes and premium limited-time offerings signal a similar attempt to mix higher-end cues with value structures. Wendy's has spiced up its lineup with elevated sandwiches, such as the Mushroom Bacon Burger, and premium nugget varieties amid its ongoing value promotions.\n\nBurger King's Whopper upgrades fall right in line with the trend. Curtis framed the move as refinement, not reinvention.\n\n\"Guests today expect higher-quality execution without losing the familiarity of their favorites,\" Curtis told Business Insider. \"These changes are about elevating the experience and maintaining the core attributes that make the Whopper a category leader. It's a reflection of rising consumer expectations across the industry.\"\n\n\"Anytime a brand changes its most iconic product, there is risk,\" Kelly O'Keefe, founding partner at Brand Federation, told Business Insider, pointing to New Coke as a cautionary tale: \"consumers were furious, and the new product was killed faster than a new Cracker Barrel logo.\"\n\nStill, he said, ignoring evolving expectations can be just as dangerous.\n\n\"In the burger category, premium players like Five Guys and Shake Shack are thriving, and Burger King is playing catch-up,\" O'Keefe said. \"If they don't stray too far from what their customers love about a Whopper, I think this could be very successful.\"\n\nAsit Sharma, an analyst at The Motley Fool, said his immediate reaction to the Whopper changes was: \"What took you so long?!\"\n\nHe pointed to McDonald's 2023 efforts to refresh the Big Mac — including steps to improve texture, sauce quality, and buns — as evidence that even the biggest chains see premiumization as table stakes.\n\nSharma also suggested that Burger King's narrative about listening to fans likely intersects with franchisee pressure, noting that, by parent Restaurant Brand International's admission, the development process took years. Curtis didn't dispute franchisee involvement, saying franchisees \"were an important part of this process,\" and adding that their operational input helped ensure the changes could be executed consistently.\n\nAnalysts say that premiumization, when done right, can help brands protect traffic and pricing power even as consumers remain value-focused. Sharma described the dynamic as a potential \"glass half-empty\" defensive move — one that prevents customers from moving to higher-end competitors — or a \"glass half-full\" opportunity to draw in diners who are trading down but still demand quality.\n\n\"Substituting a few ingredients for the trappings of a more premium burger (including cardboard packaging) is a way to entice more affluent customers who may be trading down in a tough economy,\" Sharma said.\n\nMike Perry, founder of the creative agency Tavern, which has worked on rebranding efforts with companies including Burger King, described the clamshell-style box as \"the most innovative thing they've done\" because it signals care and structure that customers remember from earlier eras of fast food.\n\nFor Burger King, Curtis said the company is \"more excited than ever\" to act on what it heard through its feedback initiative, adding that the Whopper is the first of what the brand anticipates will be many \"thoughtful updates\" to the menu over time.\n\nIf the bet works, Burger King could demonstrate a path forward for legacy fast-food brands trying to thread a needle: keep the value-minded core, win back lapsed customers who've traded up, and do it all without breaking the emotional contract customers have with an icon.",

    "description": "Some professors are waiting for a final decision on acceptable instruction under a review policy created by the system’s new chancellor.",
    "fullText": "Six weeks after the spring semester began, the Texas Tech University System Board of Regents met Thursday but did not publicly answer a central question facing professors: What, exactly, are they allowed to teach about race, gender and sexuality?\n\nThe new chancellor, Brandon Creighton, upended longstanding academic norms late last year when he directed faculty to recognize there are only two sexes, male and female; barred them from promoting the idea that individuals are inherently racist or sexist; and required regents’ approval of flagged course content. Since then, courses were canceled, readings removed or shortened and instructors required to sign statements agreeing not to teach certain material unless regents approve it.\n\nTexas Tech University officials, who have declined to say how many courses were affected by Creighton’s directive, previously said regents would consider curriculum recommendations at the Feb. 26 meeting and make final decisions on what could be taught.\n\nFor weeks, a black-and-white protest flyer circulated on campus promoting a Feb. 26 rally from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Texas Tech’s campus in Lubbock. It altered the university’s slogan, “From here, it’s possible,” to read: “From here, it’s [REDACTED].” Beneath the altered motto, the flyer accused the university of advancing a “political agenda” and urged students not to “let Texas Tech betray you.”\n\nMeeting in Dallas, roughly 350 miles away at a Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center campus, regents spent much of the morning hearing campus updates and recognitions.\n\nCreighton, attending his first regents meeting as chancellor, began by reflecting on his first 99 days before turning the meeting over to campus presidents.\n\n“I’ve seen first hand the reach of the system, not just in geography, but in impact,” he said. “The Texas Tech system is changing lives every single day, and it’s our people who make that possible. That’s what makes the system so special, and frankly, once again, why I’m so grateful to be here.”\n\nMidwestern State University officials boasted that its men’s soccer team won the NCAA Division II national championship.\n\nTexas Tech President Lawrence Schovanec highlighted a recent choir performance at a statewide music convention in San Antonio.\n\n“Last week, I was on the phone with a reporter from the New York Times who asked me, ‘What positive stories about higher education should we be telling?’ And I said, ‘Well, this is going to surprise you, but I want to talk about the Texas Tech choir,’” Shovanec said.\n\nSeveral thousand people attended the performance, he said.\n\n“It was so moving, almost as moving as athletic events,” Schovanec said, jokingly.\n\nTexas Tech University Health Sciences Center President Lori Rice-Spearman discussed a rural breast cancer screening effort that provided more than 2,700 exams across West Texas. She said one patient, a 50-year-old woman from Roscoe, 230 miles west of Dallas, had never received a mammogram.\n\n“She got an exam that revealed abnormalities in both of her breasts, leading to a diagnosis and life-saving treatment,” Rice-Spearman said.\n\nThe board also advanced major construction projects, including a roughly $168 million academic complex and a $128 million agricultural building at Texas Tech University, along with health facilities in El Paso.\n\nThe Academic, Clinical and Student Affairs Committee lasted only a few minutes and included no public discussion about the course content review.\n\nRegent Shelley Sweatt briefly addressed the items approved on the consent agenda, noting they were promotions, tenure decisions and several new degree programs that had been “carefully discussed and considered” by regents and campus leaders to meet workforce and student needs.\n\nAmong them was a new master’s degree in renewable energy at Texas Tech University, which drew scrutiny earlier in the week from conservative website Texas Scorecard. The publication questioned the need for the program.\n\nRegents then spent nearly five hours meeting privately in executive session. Just before 4 p.m., they returned and approved three items: changes to board employment rules tied to Senate Bill 37, a contract for an electronic medical records project in El Paso, and a real estate purchase.\n\nThey did not address the curriculum review and did not say whether it came up behind closed doors. The board’s next regularly scheduled meeting is May 7.\n\nBack in Lubbock, between 50 and 80 students and professors rallied in opposition to the curriculum review.\n\nTara Findley, vice president of Democrats for Texas at Texas Tech, said organizers held the protest during the regents meeting to pressure them and raise awareness among a student body she described as not very politically active. Records show that administrators have told professors not to bring up the course content review in class.\n\n“They’re not being transparent at all about this,” Findley said of administrators.\n\nFindley, a junior studying public relations and political science, said she initially planned to invite a representative from a transgender rights organization to speak to her class, but her professor worried it might violate the new rules. Findley instead invited a representative from the American Association of University Professors, a group that has opposed curriculum reviews as a violation of academic freedom.\n\nWearing his academic regalia, Andrew Martin, an art professor and president of the Texas Tech chapter of the AAUP, used a megaphone to say the review undermines the university’s educational mission.\n\n“We all need to learn more about the world as it is, and no one group can determine reality for us,” Martin said. “The concerns our students are raising are real, and the hour for all of us to be alarmed is now.”\n\nAccording to Creighton’s Dec. 1 memorandum and an accompanying flow chart, faculty who believe their course materials implicate the race and gender directives must first determine if the content is “relevant and necessary” for classroom instruction. If it is not required for professional licensure, certification or patient and client care, instructors must disclose the content to a department chair, dean and provost. The provost then decides whether to recommend the material to regents for approval. Faculty who do not seek review are expected to remove the content and could face discipline if they do not.\n\nOther public university systems have adopted similar restrictions in recent months.\n\nThe Texas A&M University System Board of Regents adopted a policy that states “no system academic course will advocate for race or gender ideology, or topics related to sexual orientation or gender identity” unless they are upper-level or graduate courses and receive written approval from a university president.\n\nLast week, the University of Texas Board of Regents approved a rule requiring its institutions to ensure students can graduate without studying what it calls “unnecessary controversial subjects,” and faculty take a “broad and balanced approach” when discussing them.\n\nMany university leaders have justified restrictions by citing SB 37, a new state law expanding regents’ authority over hiring, discipline and curriculum. The law requires regents to periodically review general education curricula to ensure courses are foundational and prepare students for civic and professional life. It does not explicitly ban or require pre-approval of specific lessons on race, gender and sexuality.\n\nCreighton authored the law during his final legislative session as a Republican state senator before becoming chancellor.\n\nThe Texas Tribune partners with Open Campus on higher education coverage.\n\nDisclosure: Texas A&M University System, Texas Tech University and Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

    "fullText": "Many people have perfected the art of sleeping on airplanes. That's especially true for those who frequently find themselves on redeye flights. However, hundreds of people in Germany found themselves trying to get some shuteye while forced to wait out a storm on the tarmac, when airline officials grounded six planes.\n\nHowever, when it became clear the flights wouldn't be cleared for takeoff until the following day, the passengers were left to wait in their seats overnight, creating a messy situation for the travelers. Now the airline and airport officials are apologizing for their mistakes.\n\nSome of the upper brass at Munich Airport and Lufthansa spent their Friday apologizing to passengers after both men took responsibility for mistakes that left around 600 people on grounded planes in a snowstorm. The incident happened on Feb. 19, according to Yahoo News, when inclement weather prompted them to close the skies for a bit, which prevented the planes from departing before the city's 1 a.m. travel curfew.\n\nHowever, those in charge failed to notify the firefighters who normally would've come in and removed the passengers from the plane, resulting in a tense night for travelers. \"We didn't manage it well,\" Thomas Hoff Andersson, Munich airport's managing director of aviation and operations said in a press conference.\n\n\"We made mistakes that night,\" Heiko Reitz, one of Lufthansa board member's added. \"Incidents like this cannot be allowed to happen.\"\n\nThe executives said that they made the decision not to alert the emergency personnel since the passengers were in no danger, a decision they both later came to regret.\n\nBusiness Insider was able to connect with some of those 600 people left on the planes, and they opened up about what it was like onboard. \"There was no food or drink for us,\" Søren Thieme revealed. \"There were no blankets for us either.\" Apparently, when passengers asked about getting off the planes and heading back into the airport to wait, they were told that it was forbidden.\n\nHowever, a Lufthansa spokesperson denied those claims, and told Business Insider that the passengers were well cared for, saying, \"The crews kept passengers informed and provided them with the catering available on board, as far as possible. All aircraft were heated and had sufficient power.\"\n\nPlanes can get grounded for all kinds of reasons. And while that situation was definitely an unusual one, U.S. travelers do have some recourse when it comes to being waylaid mid-flight. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), airlines have to de-board any planes that are expected to be delayed by more than three hours for domestic flights and four hours on international ones.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions to that rule, according to the DOT, and you cannot get off the plane when:\n\nWhen air traffic control prohibits the deboarding\n\nI can't think of a worse way to start your vacation, which is why it's important to consider reading up on your rights about delays before your next flight. Otherwise, you may find yourself in an uncomfortable situation like the German travelers did.",

    "description": "The launch reflects two big trends.",
    "fullText": "China's electric vehicle boom just delivered one of the year's most headline-grabbing launches: a new electric pickup truck priced around $18,000 that turns heads for both its tech and design, as Electrek reported.\n\nThe vehicle — officially the Rely R08 EV, from Chery Automotive's pickup-focused sub-brand Rely — marks the company's first fully electric pickup. It slots into a growing segment as automakers race to electrify even heavy-duty work trucks.\n\nWhat's especially notable is how closely the R08 resembles the rugged Toyota Hilux — the globally popular pickup known for its durability — a similarity that's sparked buzz (and a few memes) online.\n\nPriced from 127,800 yuan (about $18,300) to roughly 158,800 yuan (around $22,900) for higher trims, the R08 undercuts many Western EV trucks by a huge margin — and it even cuts deep into conventional truck territory. That's a striking price point for any midsize electric pickup.\n\nBuyers can choose from 66.5- or 88-kilowatt-hour battery packs and driving ranges of around 500 kilometers (approximately 310 miles).\n\nRear-wheel-drive models offer about 150 kilowatts (200 horsepower), while all-wheel-drive versions combine dual motors for roughly 300 kW (400 horsepower) and strong torque. The cabin blends work-ready, modern design with large infotainment screens and Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8155, which powers smart features, per CnEVPost.\n\nIndustry watchers say the launch reflects two big trends: China's domestic EV makers pushing aggressively into segments that have been slow to electrify, and the cost compression enabled by local supply chains and scale. In China, the pickup truck market may still be a niche compared to sedans and SUVs, but new-energy pickups are among the fastest-growing categories — up to 240% in 2025, the outlet added.\n\nOutside China, reactions are split. Enthusiasts on forums are already imagining what such a pickup could cost with tariffs and safety requirements added, while critics question build quality and safety standards, as Autonocion.com reported. Whether the Rely R08 ever makes it to the U.S. or European roads remains to be seen, but it's already shaking up the narrative around how affordable electric trucks can be.\n\nWhether you drive an EV pickup or sedan, you'll save major cash on vehicle maintenance and fuel costs.\n\nAnd if you have a home charger, you can save hundreds of dollars in annual charging costs. Qmerit can help homeowners interested in installing Level 2 chargers and provide free installation estimates.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nFor additional savings, installing a home solar system is a great investment, as it's significantly cheaper to charge with your own power rather than rely on grid energy or public chargers. When you're ready to upgrade, check out TCD's Solar Explorer, which lets you connect with vetted contractors and save up to $10,000 on installation costs. EnergySage makes it simple to compare quotes from qualified installers and get info about available tax incentives and rebates.\n\n\"Love it. Don't love that it has what appears to be a 4.5 ft bed,\" one Electrek reader commented on the Chinese EV news.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Not one of the lucky ones who can sleep through the witching hour? Don't make these 2 a.m. mistakes.",
    "fullText": "Bad dreams, blaring sirens, weak bladders — there are many reasons people can’t sleep straight from 11 at night to 7 the next morning. Doctors say it’s totally normal, but how you handle these sleep disruptions can be the difference between feeling rested and refreshed or groggy and cranky. If you want to salvage your slumber, here’s what to do — and what not to do — when you wake up in the middle of the night.\n\nThe number one, most important thing not to do when your sleep is interrupted? Check the time. As tempting as it may be to take a quick glance on the way back from the bathroom or when your mind starts to race, do not give in to the temptation.\n\n“For occasional awakenings, avoid looking at the clock. Clock-watching can increase anxiety and make it harder to fall back asleep,” says Dr. Harneet Walia, a board-certified family physician and the medical director of sleep medicine at Baptist Health Miami Cardiac & Vascular Institute.\n\nDr. B Stephen Sanders, a board-certified men’s health physician based in Florida, suggests going a step further. “Put the clock where you can't see it and let your alarm do its job,” he says. “Every time you check the time, you’re attempting to do the math on how many hours you have left, which feeds the anxiety loop.”\n\nWho among us is not guilty of powering up a device when sleep seems elusive? But all doctors agree here — this is a very bad habit that needs to be corrected. Dr. Bijoy E. John, a board-certified sleep physician in Nashville, Tenn., explains that the light exposure from screens signals wakefulness to the brain, which can make it even harder to fall back asleep. “Do not reach for your phone,” he urges.\n\nReady for some good news? Not sleeping through the night is pretty common, so resist the urge to freak out if you don’t doze back off right away.\n\nDr. Julia Whitaker, a board-certified sleep medicine specialist based in Colorado, says do your best to stay relaxed and calm. “Waking once or twice is normal. The real problem is the reaction. Looking at the clock and thinking, ‘Oh no, I’ll be exhausted tomorrow,’ triggers stress hormones and makes it harder to fall back asleep,” she says.\n\nLying awake when you could (and should) be sleeping can be frustrating, but be patient, remain calm and give yourself time to slip back into a peaceful slumber.\n\n“The goal is to get your mind back in a relaxing and restful state without stressing over the fact that you’re awake or overstimulating your mind,” says Dr. Sergio Guiteau, a board-certified physician based in Florida.\n\nThe unfortunate reality is that there will be nights when falling back asleep takes longer than you'd like. When that happens, don’t force it.\n\n“If you’ve been awake for what feels like about 20 minutes and you’re not falling back asleep, get out of bed,” Walia advises. “Return to bed only when you feel sleepy again. This helps train the brain to associate the bed with sleep rather than wakefulness or frustration.”\n\nSo, should you start a scary movie or scroll TikTok at 2 a.m. when you can’t sleep? No! If you need to get out of bed to give yourself time to get tired again, doctors recommend low-light, low-stimulation activities to pass the time.\n\nDr. Jose Puangco, a neurologist and sleep medicine specialist at Hoag, a health care system in Southern California, says good options include reading a few pages of a low-key book, listening to soft music or a calming podcast at low volume, doing gentle stretching, or practicing slow breathing or meditation. You can also try working on a jigsaw puzzle or knitting.\n\nWhile occasional sleep interruptions are normal, long, recurring lapses in rest are worth discussing with your doctor. “If waking up during the night becomes frequent or persistent, it may signal an underlying medical disorder and sleep disorder and should be evaluated,” Walia notes.\n\nNeed something to do while you’re waiting for sleepiness to return? Try these shopper-loved finds.\n\nRest assured, Amazon customers say absolutely no prior skills are needed to enjoy this adorable little crochet set. It's very beginner-friendly, and you can work on it in short, middle-of-the-night spurts until your little penguin friend (or one of the other little crocheted creatures) is complete.\n\n\"I recently ventured into the world of crochet as an absolute beginner, and the Dinosaur Woobles Kit has been an absolute game-changer for me. I couldn't be happier with my purchase,\" one fan commented.\n\nAnother added, \"Great beginner project — you’ll learn a lot! I had no experience with crochet and ended up with a cute gift for a friend’s birthday! It definitely was a challenge, but just enough to keep going.\"\n\nIf you find your mind racing, bouncing from thought to thought, it may help to write them down. This journal includes prompts that can help you focus and ease underlying stress.\n\n\"A life-changing journal!\" one shopper declared. \"This is a must-have for everyone!!! This journal will change your brain to see the good and stop looking for the bad! Very easy to use and organized to keep you right on track. My husband and I have been using these for almost a year now, and one of my favorite things to gift anyone going through a tough time!\"\n\nSomeone else shared, \"I was looking for something simple and intentional to help me focus on gratitude and positivity without feeling overwhelming, and this journal fits that perfectly.\"\n\nEveryone's going analog these days, so why not jump on the bandwagon with this needlepoint set? It includes everything you'll need to create three different projects, and shoppers say it's easy for newbies to complete.\n\n\"Great product! Everything you need to learn embroidery, and the tutorials make it easy to learn all the stitches. Highly recommend for beginners,\" one commenter wrote.\n\n\"I’ve never ever embroidered before and this kit was SO easy to follow with plenty of embroidery floss in case you mess up! The pics and videos for the techniques were perfect,\" another added.\n\nAre you a puzzle person? Me too! They're exactly what I turn to when I need to slow down my brain and find a bit of zen. I'm currently eyeing this gorgeous design that's already earned 4.7 out of 5 stars from shoppers who say it's just as beautiful IRL as the picture, and it's the perfect balance of challenging but not impossible.\n\n\"I loved this puzzle. Bold colors with endless variation. Made solving it challenging but also attainable. Great product,\" one shopper commented.\n\nAnother wrote, \"I absolutely love the design of this puzzle — the colors are vivid and really satisfying to work with. The pieces are well cut and sturdy, with no peeling or fraying edges, which makes a big difference on a 1,000-piece build. Everything fit together nicely, and it felt like a quality product start to finish. I’d definitely buy this brand again.\"\n\nThis book includes over 40 soothing stories and guided meditations designed to help you relax and prepare your body for sleep. On that front, shoppers say it delivers. Choose from a Kindle version for $3, or you can grab it in audiobook and other forms.\n\n\"I found this book helpful and calming,\" one person wrote. \"I sometimes have insomnia. Usually, I don't know what to do. With this book, it became easier to cope with insomnia, or rather, it became easier to calm the flow of thoughts in my head.\"",

    "fullText": "A new Toyota SUV test prototype was spotted undergoing testing in Thailand, and all signs point to it being the next-generation Fortuner body-on-frame SUV.\n\nFor more than two decades, the rugged Toyota Hilux midsize pickup has had an SUV sidekick in the guise of the Fortuner in markets including India, southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. It used to be available in Australia as well, but it was retired from the market last year over poor sales.\n\nThe three-row Fortuner will soon enter its third generation, taking after the recently launched ninth-gen Hilux pickup on which it is based. While the prototype you see in these photos is fully camouflaged, the design cues borrowed from the new Hilux are hard to miss.\n\nThe front end appears to feature very similar slim LED headlights and the same grille seen on the 2026 Hilux, with the side view largely following the design of the double cab Hilux up to the C-pillar—with a small difference in that the Fortuner's belt line rises suddenly before crossing the rear passenger windows.\n\nObviously, the Fortuner has a typical SUV format with two additional side windows and a tailgate instead of the Hilux's truck bed. Another difference from the Hilux, which has vertical taillights, is that the Fortuner has horizontal full-width lamps.\n\nInside, the new Fortuner will expected to adopt a similar dashboard as the 2026 Hilux, which features a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and 12.3-inch central infotainment screens. The Fortuner will offer a total of seven seats on three rows, and is expected to get updated advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).\n\nThe upcoming Toyota Fortuner carry on with the same IMV platform shared with the Hilux, which means that it will offer gas and mild-hybrid diesel powertrains, with a battery electric version also possible, though not confirmed. The platform also supports a hydrogen fuel-cell variant, which is currently in development and will debut in 2028 on the Hilux.\n\nAs you probably know, the new Hilux offers an all-electric version, a first for the nameplate. It features a 59.2-kWh lithium-ion battery powering two electric motors with a combined 193 hp and 349 lb-ft of torque. The Hilux BEV has a targeted WLTP range of up to 160 miles, a 1,576-lb payload and a towing rating of up to 3,527 lbs.\n\nWhile a BEV version is unconfirmed for the Fortuner, the SUV will be available with a 201-hp 2.8-liter four-cylinder turbodiesel featuring a 48-volt mild-hybrid setup. A 164-hp 2.7-liter four-cylinder gas engine may also be offered.\n\nAccording to Thailand's Car250 (via Electrek), the next-generation Toyota Fortuner will debut in Thailand by the end of 2026, spreading to its traditional markets shortly after. Unsurprisingly, the United States will not get the Fortuner, as our market doesn’t get the Hilux either.",

    "fullText": "Mom Michele Guarino, 42, died after she was involved in a multi-car crash in South Carolina\n\nThe victim's sister said she found her sibling's car \"totaled\" when she went to the scene of the crash\n\n“I am comforted in believing it happened so quickly that she did not know what occurred and did not suffer,” her sister wrote\n\nA mom of two died after she was involved in a multi-car crash in South Carolina.\n\nThe South Carolina Highway Patrol (SCHP) said the crash occurred at 7:20 a.m. local time on Friday, Feb. 20, on Highway 378 in Lexington County, according to WIS and FOX affiliate WACH.\n\nA Ford pickup truck and a Nissan SUV were traveling on opposite sides of the highway when the Ford hit the Nissan as the SUV was turning left onto Spring Hill Road, troopers said. The Ford then struck a Cadillac SUV, which was turning right onto the highway.\n\nThe driver of the Nissan — identified as Michele Guarino, according to CBS affiliate WLTX — was transported to Prisma Health Richland after the crash. She died three days later on Monday, Feb. 23.\n\nSCHP did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.\n\nMarissa Guarino, Michele's sister, said her sister sustained “catastrophic brain injuries” in the crash and was put on life support before she died, according to a message on GoFundMe. She was 42 years old and leaves behind two teenage daughters.\n\n“I am comforted in believing it happened so quickly that she did not know what occurred and did not suffer,” Marissa wrote on the fundraiser. “For that, I am grateful. But her absence will be felt deeply and permanently within our family.”\n\nBefore she learned what happened to her sister, Marissa told WLTX she got a notification on her phone that there had been a serious accident. She and her husband went to the scene, only to see her sister’s car had been involved.\n\n“When we get there, we see it is her car. It’s totaled. The front of it is smashed. The airbags went off inside the car,” she recalled.\n\nFamily said Michele donated her organs to five people, according to WLTX.\n\n“She always had such empathy when she heard tragic stories like this,” Marissa said. “Saving other lives so that other people don’t have to go through this.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nMore than $167,000 has been raised through the GoFundMe for Michele’s daughters, with donations going toward “protecting their future and ensuring they have the support, resources, and opportunities Michele would have worked tirelessly to give them.”\n\n“No child should have to lose a parent this young,” Marissa wrote. “While we cannot take away their pain, we can stand beside them and help carry forward the life Michele envisioned for her babies.”",

    "fullText": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un gifted new sniper rifles to top government and military officials following a weeklong ruling party congress celebrating his leadership, with state media highlighting an image of his teenage daughter taking aim at a shooting range as her increasingly prominent appearances fuel speculation Kim is grooming her as a future leader.\n\nKim presented the rifles to senior party and military officials on Friday, calling them a sign of his “absolute trust” and gratitude for their commitment over the past five years since the last Workers’ Party congress in 2021, North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said Saturday.\n\nThe report also confirmed Kim’s powerful sister, Kim Yo Jong, who in recent years has served as his fierce spokesperson toward Washington and Seoul, now serves as the general affairs director of the party’s central committee following a promotion at the congress. Her new title signals a broader role overseeing the party’s internal operations and administrative affairs.\n\nState media photos showed Kim Yo Jong and other top officials aiming the rifles handed out by Kim Jong Un at a shooting range. Kim’s young daughter, wearing a brown leather coat similar to her father’s, also was seen handling the weapon as smoke rose from the barrel.\n\nSince first appearing in public at a long-range missile test in November 2022, the girl — believed to be named Kim Ju Ae and about 13 years old — has accompanied her father to a growing number of events, including military demonstrations, factory openings and a trip to Beijing in September, where Kim Jong Un held his first summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in six years.\n\nThe party congress, which concluded Wednesday in Pyongyang after seven days, is North Korea’s most significant political event, held every five years since 2016, and a carefully choreographed spectacle glorifying Kim's leadership before thousands of delegates.\n\nAt this year’s meetings, Kim doubled down on his plans to accelerate North Korea's nuclear arsenal, which already is equipped with various weapons systems threatening the United States and U.S. allies in Asia, and confirmed his hard-line view of rival South Korea.\n\nBut he also left the door open for dialogue with the U.S., reiterating Pyongyang’s earlier stance calling for Washington to abandon demands for the North’s denuclearization as a precondition for resuming long-stalled dialogue.\n\nSouth Korean officials and experts closely monitored the congress for signs Kim was preparing to extend the family's dynastic rule to a fourth generation by cementing his daughter as successor. Earlier this month, South Korea’s spy agency said it assessed Kim Jong Un was close to designating her as heir.\n\nShe was not seen at party meetings during the congress but shared center stage with her father at a military parade Wednesday night marking its conclusion. Despite speculation she might receive a formal party post at the congress, state media reports indicated no such move and party rules require members to be at least 18.\n\nSome experts say if Kim Jong Un sought to use the congress to solidify his daughter as successor, the signals would likely be subtle, such as self-congratulatory statements about North Korea’s survival and crediting that endurance to the successful inheritance of the socialist cause.\n\nIn a report assessing the congress on Thursday, North Korean state media said the meetings “laid a solid foundation for the sacred effort to ensure and realize the glorious succession and development of our party.”",

    "description": "CEO JT Batson says the tournament is forcing brands to see the value of the sport’s fans.",
    "fullText": "The 2026 FIFA World Cup — jointly hosted by the US, Canada, and Mexico— represents a coming of age for the sport that most of the world calls football in the country that calls it soccer. JT Batson, CEO of US Soccer, hopes the kickoff to the tournament this June will also be a vindication of four years of work to modernize the group behind the US men’s and women’s national teams, and a moment for more brands to understand the spending power of their fans.\n\n“Having the World Cup here has been a bit of a forcing function to crisply articulate your soccer strategy as a brand,” he says. US Soccer counts two dozen commercial partners, from American Airlines and AT&T to Visa and Volkswagen, who Batson says have been drawn by the demographics of the sport’s large US fanbase. “It’s growing, it’s young, it’s diverse, and it’s tech savvy; those are all things you care about as a brand.”\n\nSurveys suggest the sport has the momentum to build that fan base further. A Harris Poll last year found the number of US soccer followers increased 17% between 2020 and 2025. Almost three-quarters of Americans now say they are interested in soccer, of whom 20% describe themselves as “obsessed.”\n\nUS Soccer’s own growth has exceeded that pace: Its revenues are up more than 300% since 2023, as it changed its commercial model to bring sponsorship, media, and marketing rights in-house. Batson has pulled in record philanthropic donations, including $50 million from Home Depot co-founder Arthur Blank for a new national training center in Atlanta, and $30 million from Washington Spirit owner Michele Kang for women’s and girls’ programs.\n\nAnother factor has helped the corporate interest, Batson adds: the fact that many large companies are run by executives who grew up watching the sport. “Generations ago, that was not the case.”\n\nBatson, an early employee of Mozilla who had played for Augusta Arsenal in Georgia before becoming a referee, came to his job after a chance encounter with US Soccer’s board chair on an Amtrak train. “I learned it was a nonprofit that didn’t do fundraising, so I went home and made a fundraising strategy,” he recalls. He joined as a volunteer before being made CEO in 2022. Here’s how he describes his game plan for the World Cup and the sport he now oversees.\n\nAndrew Edgecliffe-Johnson: US Soccer’s revenues have increased by more than 300% since 2023. What has it taken to do that?\n\nJT Batson: The biggest thing for us is embracing that we are a soccer nation. We’ve grown a tremendous amount since the 1994 women’s World Cup, and we set out a strategy last year of being “in service to soccer.” We asked ourselves, “If we stepped out of our role and were back to being a fan, what would we hope US Soccer would be doing?” There were three things we needed at the same time to unlock our potential: trust, the right strategy, and the right communication. If you’re missing any one of those three, this doesn’t work.\n\nWhat has driven the growth in corporate partnerships?\n\nFirst, the US soccer market is large, with well over 100 million fans. Second, the US men’s and women’s national teams are among the most popular teams in the country. And third, so many people in positions of responsibility in corporations are soccer people through and through. In a previous generation, maybe they’d have been football people or baseball people or basketball people. This generation deeply understands the sport and cares about it as a growth driver. A number of big brands have told us their No. 1 growth priority is soccer.\n\nWhat’s your strategy for using the World Cup to elevate soccer in the US?\n\nFirst, we’ve got to make sure that our team is in the best position to win. We’ve hired the best possible coaches for our team, and we’ve got a great player pool. We’re also very focused on making sure everyone in America can participate. So we’re making it super accessible to go into a Walmart or a CVS and buy US Soccer gear, and we’re supporting watch parties in hundreds of communities.\n\nWhat we want to hold ourselves accountable to is being in a position where soccer is the most-played sport in every community. We’ve announced initiatives around soccer in schools, aimed at ensuring anyone who wants to play soccer can play. We also focus on making sure kids are having fun. Very often there’s a professionalization of kids’ sports at too young an age. Of course we want to produce players who can win World Cups, but at its core, you want to train hard when you’re having fun.\n\nCritics including New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani are concerned that World Cup tickets will be unaffordable. Is the sport pricing fans out?\n\nAll sports are having to confront the fact there are way more people who want to be in the stands than there are seats. We’re very mindful of that, [so] for all our games, we’ll have a reserved set of tickets that are very affordable for our core fans. We’re looking at how we leverage technology to ensure our diehard fans are closest to the field.\n\nWith 27 national teams, you’re surrounded by coaches. What have you learned about leadership from them?\n\nI’ve asked them about the dynamics of managing a team and they ask me as many questions around managing a business. What we find is that there’s a lot in common. Probing an analogous space leads you to learn and stretch.\n\nWhat leads to success in soccer is very similar to what leads to success in business. A key thing is to remember that every market is unique. If you enter a new market and you do not become a student of that market and learn everything about it, the rules, it’s going to eat you up and spit you out. You can have the greatest [product], but if you can’t solve for the consumers in that market, you can waste a whole lot of time and money.\n\nWill soccer in the US one day have the global status that the Premier League, the Bundesliga, or Serie A do now?\n\nOur market is very big. It is growing, we now have infrastructure, and we have talent. You’ve also got a generation of Americans who’ve grown up when they’ve only known Major League Soccer to exist and it’s a core part of their media diet. Talent is a leading indicator of success in an organization, and the talent that’s choosing to go to MLS is getting better and better. Then you apply the great commercialization of sport in the US, and you’re onto something. The [team] owners in the US are the best in the world. Think about their resources and their sports business acumen. The Bundesliga or Serie A don’t have that. The ownership depth and breadth is a huge strategic advantage.\n\nUS Soccer held a summit in Washington, DC, in December that drew more than 400 partners and donors, highlighting the organization’s “financial glow-up” under Batson, Sports Business Journal reported.",

Webb confirmed he will make two starts in the international tournament, but wants to clear some things up ahead of time.\n\n\"I feel like I got slack for that, too,\" Webb told Kratz about him and Skenes making two starts and Skubal making one start at the WBC. \"I don't think they understand it's only seven games.

    "fullText": "Troy Ryan is grateful and honored to have overseen the Canadian women’s hockey team at two Olympics and told The Associated Press on Friday that he believes it’s time he stepped down as coach.\n\nAsked if he foresees coaching the team at the world championships in November, Ryan said: “I don’t believe so. I would never say never, but very unlikely.”\n\nHe then added: “I think it’s time for someone else to run with it and take it to new heights.”\n\nRyan spoke by phone from Seattle, where his Toronto Sceptres return from the PWHL’s month-long Olympic break to play the Torrent. And Ryan spoke a day after first suggesting his tenure as coach was over during a video conference call with PWHL reporters.\n\n“I do believe to some extent that there is time for change, and this is probably the right time for change,” Ryan said. “I’ve had those conversations consistently over the years with Hockey Canada on when the right time to transition into either a different role or just completely transition out of the program.”\n\nRyan’s contract with Hockey Canada expires this year. He said further details need to be worked out, and he hoped to have a voice in the succession plan. Among the potential candidates to replace him are two of his assistants, Kori Cheverie and former Canadian Olympian Caroline Ouellette.\n\nThe 54-year-old Ryan prepares to leave his job following a 2-1 overtime loss to the United States in the gold-medal game at the Milan Cortina Olympics. It was an outing in which the Canadians pushed a younger, faster American team to a near upset before Hilary Knight tied the game with 2:04 remaining and Megan Keller sealed the win 4:07 into overtime.\n\nDespite the loss, Ryan earned credit for his six-year tenure that included a gold-medal win at the 2022 Beijing Games. He also coached Canada to win three world championship titles, along with two silvers.\n\nRyan will be best remembered for turning around a team that bottomed out by losing to host Finland in the semifinals at the 2019 world championships and settling for bronze. It marked the only time Canada had not reached the gold-medal round in world championship or Olympic play.\n\nThe Canadians dominated the Beijing tournament by winning all seven games in which they outscored their opponents by a combined 57-10, closing with a 3-2 gold-medal win over the U.S.\n\nRyan’s pending departure coincides with what is expected to be a large turnover of what was a veteran Canadian roster, led by 34-year-old captain Marie-Philip Poulin and featuring, forwards Natalie Spooner (35), Brianne Jenner (34) and defender Jocelyne Larocque (37).\n\nPoulin, aka “Captain Clutch,” said she has not yet determined her future.\n\nThe roster changeover factored into Ryan’s decision as he considered it an ideal time for a new coach to begin reshaping the team for the 2030 Olympics in France. He’d like to remain a part of the program in an advisory role to assist the new coach, but noted that will be up to Hockey Canada and his successor.\n\nAP Olympic coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "Forfeits by high school boys' soccer teams in the City Section and Southern Section playoffs continued on Friday as both sections try to deal with violations of CIF bylaw 600, which prohibits players from participating in outside leagues during their sports season.\n\nCalabasas pulled out of the Southern Section Division 3 boys soccer championship on Friday because of an ineligible player. Chavez became the sixth City Section school eliminated from the playoffs for using an ineligible player and was replaced by Chatsworth for the City Division I final.\n\nThere's also an allegation about another Southern Section team that could result in another forfeit in the final.\n\nSome high schools thought they had found a solution around the rule by not allowing players to play high school soccer until after their club seasons ended in early December. Cathedral had several players miss its first three games because there's several big club tournaments in November and early December.\n\n\"You communicate to students and parents,\" Cathedral coach Arturo Lopez said. \"Unfortunately, there's more and more academies now.\"\n\nRon Nocetti, the executive director of the CIF, said, \"I think we have to have conversations with our sections.\"\n\nSeveral times CIF membership has rejected getting rid of bylaw 600. Schools don't want to have their coaches battling it out weekly with club coaches, which also would place additional pressure on athletes dealing with school work and then having to do double workouts.\n\nThe balancing act for students is already tough enough with growing club teams in a lot of sports because it's a lucrative business. The CIF briefly suspended the rule during the pandemic in 2020 but quickly reinstated it.\n\nThe problem is club soccer programs are holding competitions in the middle of the high school season, and players, knowing the rule that you can't play high school and club at the same time, have apparently decided to try to do both with the hope of not getting caught.\n\nThis year, they are getting caught. Emails alleging violations started arriving to City Section commissioner Vicky Lagos before the semifinals. If a player is found to have played club, the high school team has to forfeit, and if it happens during the playoffs, the team is eliminated.\n\nUsually the pressure is on schools to make sure rules are not violated, but for bylaw 600, schools can do everything right and still be punished for a player violating the rule on their own.\n\nSeveral leagues are expected to present proposals to get rid of bylaw 600.\n\nNocetti said membership might be open to adopting changes.\n\n\"Maybe this is a tipping point for schools saying maybe it's time to make a big change with the rule,\" he said.\n\nA.

    "description": "Los Angeles Dodgers president of baseball operations named left-hander Justin Wrobleski as a candidate for the starting rotation in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers president of baseball operations named left-hander Justin Wrobleski as a candidate for the starting rotation in 2026.\n\nWrobleski, 25, has featured for the Dodgers 32 times over the last two regular season campaigns, eight of which came as starts. Through his two seasons with the Dodgers, Wrobleski has a 4.81 ERA and 102 strikeouts through 103 innings pitched.\n\nHe hit his stride towards the end of the 2025 season, keeping allowing a run in just two of his final eight appearances of the season. The southpaw continued to dominate into the postseason, not allowing a single run through four appearances — including two World Series games.\n\n“I think his ability to grow and mature and learn how to harness his stuff and compete in those moments will serve him well as he tries to navigate a lineup two, three times,” Friedman said, per MLB’s Sonja Chen. “He’ll certainly be a candidate. He was also so good out of the ‘pen, we have to weigh that.”\n\nWrobleski struggled as a starter last season, beginning just two games on the mound and allowing 12 earned runs through 11 innings. The Dodgers, though, may not have much of a choice.\n\nAs of now, the Dodgers’ rotation is completely open, at least to begin the season. Tyler Glasnow and Yoshinobu Yamamoto are sure to have a spot at the beginning of the season, but Blake Snell and Shohei Ohtani have big question marks hanging above them as far as pitching on Opening Day pitching is concerned.\n\nThe remaining spots have plenty of suitors, and the current frontrunners are Roki Sasaki, Emmet Sheehan, Gavin Stone and River Ryan. Both Stone and Ryan are coming back from season-long injuries, so if the Dodgers were to look at someone to fill the spot who can immediately undertake a full workload, it would make sense for them to look at Wrobleski as someone who has started games before.\n\nWrobleski has already made his spring training debut for 2026 and looked solid through the singular inning he pitched, notching a strikeout through a scoreless inning against the Cleveland Guardians.\n\nIf he can continue to produce results throughout the spring, the third-year left-hander could make a return to a starting spot in 2026.\n\nWould you want to see Justin Wrobleski start games this season?",

    "description": "The best goal scorer to ever wear the famous stripes for the Bianconere is heading to the United States for a little while.",
    "fullText": "Cristiana Girelli has accomplished just about everything you can as a women’s footballer in Italy. She has led the league in goals, she has won titles upon titles upon titles, with her trophy case at Brescia and then Juventus about as plentiful as one could potentially get over the last decade and a half.\n\nBut Girelli, Juve’s No. 10 and all-time leading scorer is heading for a new experience.\n\nFor the first time in her career, Girelli is going to be playing ball outside of Italy. You can extend that to outside of Europe, too. Just like former teammates Sofia Cantore and Lisa Boattin did a summer ago, Girelli is heading for the United States, joining Bay FC on loan until August, Juventus Women announced on Friday night. To make that happen, Girelli extended her contract with Juventus Women until 2027 — which means this isn’t fully goodbye just yet, but just more of a case of “See you soon!”\n\nJust as long as she doesn’t completely fall in love with the Bay Area and everything it has to offer. Same goes for playing on a stage like the NWSL is being one of the best and most competitive leagues in the world of women’s football.\n\nCristiana Girelli has renewed her contract, and is joining NWSL side Bay FC on loan ✍️\n\nGood luck, Cri! \n\n🗞️ https://t.co/UnMeQ2Oau2 pic.twitter.com/rpzJzUyWLG\n\n— JuventusFC 🇬🇧🇺🇸 (@juventusfcen) February 27, 2026\n\nHaving a playing experience outside of Italy is something that Girelli said she would like to see happen before her incredibly accomplished career comes to an end. And at 35 years old, she knows that those kinds of chances are only going to be possible for so much longer — which is why leaving a club (albeit likely just for a few months) that she has been at for nearly a decade is a decision she had to make.\n\nIt is something that clearly influenced the timing of this and for Girelli to jump at the chance to head to the NWSL and sign — albeit on a loan deal that will only be for about five or sixth months — with Bay FC, one of the league’s newest clubs.\n\nIt will be quite strange to see Girelli in another club’s jersey after so much time in the famous black and white stripes. She’s achieved so much in Turin between the multiple league titles and all the freakin’ goals that she’s scored. She’s the club’s all-time leader in goals scored. She’s the club’s all-time leader in appearances. She’s one of the best Italian players of this generation and a leading force in helping Juve and the Azzurre get to where they’ve gotten over the last decade.\n\nAs part of her farewell (for now), Girelli penned a letter to Juve supporters. It reads in full below:\n\nI wanted to speak to you directly because I felt the need to share my thoughts with you.\n\nIt was not an easy decision to make, quite the contrary…\n\nHowever, in football, we all know that time is limited.\n\nAn athlete’s career does not last forever and, at this point in my career, I know that certain opportunities may only come once.\n\nThis important opportunity suddenly presented itself to me, and I felt the need to test myself again, to have a different experience, before it was too late to do so.\n\nI understand that some people may not agree with the timing, but global football has different schedules and certain opportunities come when they come: either you take them at that moment, or you risk never experiencing them again.\n\nAnd that was the hardest part for me to accept.\n\nIt was a gut decision rather than a heartfelt one, because my heart only has two colours.\n\nThat’s why I don’t feel like this is goodbye.\n\nYou all know how much I love this team, you and this shirt, ever since I was a child, which I have loved every single day for the past eight years and will continue to love even from the other side of the world.\n\nThis club is my home, my family, the love of my life.\n\nAnd this experience takes nothing away from what Juventus means to me and the place it has and always will have in my heart.\n\nI know that not everyone will understand this decision, and I respect that, but I hope you will continue to support this team as you always have.\n\nI am certain that TOGETHER we can continue to fight until the end to achieve all of our goals for the season.\n\nForza Juve, Fino alla fine.\nALWAYS.\n\nGirelli’s new squad, Bay FC, opens the 2026 NWSL season on March 14 against expansion club Denver Summit FC. If she is to play in that game like many expect her to in some shape or form, she will be looking to score on former Juve teammate Pauline Peyraud-Magnin, who left Juve at the end of January and signed with Denver Summit FC a couple of weeks later.",

    "description": "A few NFL experts would be fans of the Rams trading for Colts QB Anthony Richardson.",
    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Rams aren't in the market for a new quarterback yet, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't do a little window shopping. Matthew Stafford will be back for another season in 2026, but his future beyond next season is cloudy at best.\n\nWhile L.A. could find its future franchise quarterback in the 2026 draft, there is another avenue they could go down: The trade market. While many names have been touted, two analysts from NFL.com think Anthony Richardson should be a great fit for the Rams.\n\nMarc Ross and Maurice Jones-Drew both pick L.A. as \"ideal landing spots\" for Richardson, who recently requested a trade from the Colts after his third season.\n\nRoss thinks Richardson would be able to learn a lot under Stafford and could turn build his stock back up with Sean McVay as his head coach.\n\n\"Richardson's situation is a Catch-22. He has so little playing experience that he needs to get on the field in order to develop, yet he still is not ready to play at a consistent enough level to produce wins as a starter,\" Ross wrote. \"Thus, a role with the Rams would be an ideal landing spot. He would learn behind reigning MVP Matthew Stafford in the Sean McVay offense, and the only other QB on the current roster is Stetson Bennett, who was drafted 124 spots behind Richardson in the 2023 draft. The hope would be for Richardson to emerge much like this offseason's top quarterback in the free agency market, Malik Willis, who saw drastic improvements under Matt LaFleur (the same offense McVay runs in L.A.).\"\n\nJones-Drew agreed, pointing to other McVay-like coaches who helped reclaim other first-round busts.\n\n\"Sam Darnold went from former first-round bust to Super Bowl champion, and a huge player in that career turnaround was learning from coaches Kyle Shanahan and Kevin O'Connell during stops in San Francisco and Minnesota, respectively,\" Jones-Drew wrote. \"Richardson could be the NFL's next reclamation project if he lands in the right spot after his tumultuous stint in Indy. Learning under Shanahan or Sean McVay in Los Angeles could help Richardson turn his career around and potentially earn another chance to eventually start.\"\n\nRoss and MJD aren't the only analysts who think the Rams are a good fit for Richardson. Robert Griffin III is also a fan of this move. Griffin III called a trade to L.A. \"his Sam Darnold reset year.\"\n\nThere are clear pros and cons to trading for Richardson, and it's unclear if the Rams are even interested in pulling off this move. But, at least in the media, some favor the decision. It would also be a stepping stone to a potential post-Stafford future, unless the Rams have other plans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rams Wire: Rams named as a best fit for Anthony Richardson by 2 analysts",

Orton was asked about what the milestone means to him during a recent appearance on ESPN's \"Get Up\" and just like the other nine bouts, Orton has one thing on his mind, winning.\n\n\"Ten Elimination Chambers is a lot of Elimination Chambers,\" Orton said. \"My body's been beat up all over that ring and that chamber man. It is unforgiving, but I take a lot of experience with myself into that chamber and I'm going to use it this Saturday, and I'm going to win the thing, and go to WrestleMania man. I've only got so many more years that I'm going to be able to do this, and I'm enjoying every second of it. So at the Chamber, I make it count.\"\n\nDespite Orton's record for most appearances in the Elimination Chamber, he has only ever won one of them. That win came back in 2014 when Orton was part of The Authority, but despite that victory being 12 years ago, Orton is ready to grab his second win this Saturday. \"I was the bad guy man. I came out last in the pod, Daniel Bryan was the fan favorite, I ended up winning and going on to main event WrestleMania.

    "description": "Good thing these losses don’t matter",
    "fullText": "The A’s can’t seem to get many wins this spring but luckily these games don’t count just yet. Still would be nice to see another win sometime soon as the Athletics dropped another game on Friday afternoon, losing to the Royals 7-6 and dropping their meaningless record to 1-5.\n\nThe A’s jumped out to an early lead this afternoon. A pair of walks put two runners on for Max Muncy. Looking to put some distance between himself and Darell Hernaiz for the starting third base job, Muncy took a fastball down the middle and drove it into center field for a double and bringing in both runs, giving the A’s the first lead.\n\nLeft-hander Jeffrey Springs got his first action today, taking the ball to start against KC today. While the stats don’t matter today still wasn’t a great first outing for the 33-year-old considering his early-game struggles last year. Springs had an easy first inning but got hit hard in the second, allowing four runs to score capped by a Bobby Witt Jr. three-run home run that wiped away the A’s early lead. That would chase him from this game after getting up to 39 pitches, which is probably around where the coaching staff wanted him as they slowly ramp the veteran lefty up for the long season ahead.\n\nThe A’s got one of those runs back in the next frame thanks to a Carlos Cortes double and a pair of productive groundouts to bring him in. Then the A’s got the big hit they were looking for in the fourth. Shortstop Jacob Wilson came to the plate with a runner on first and blasted a 429-foot home run to left field, his first long ball of spring and one that tied this game up a 5 apiece. The A’s would then take the lead the very next inning, courtesy of Muncy’s first home run of the spring.\n\nThe Royals would battle back late however. Lefty Brady Basso began the seventh and didn’t have his best stuff today. A double and a pair of walks loaded the bases and while he was just one strike away from getting out of the jam, a two-run double bit him and gave KC back the lead.\n\nThe A’s put together a scoring threat in the eighth thanks to a couple hits from some prospects (including Leo De Vries!), but couldn’t manage to knot this game up, falling 7-6 to finish the afternoon off.\n\nNot great but the offense has really picked it up after a slow start to spring. We do this all again tomorrow, with the San Francisco Giants coming to Hohokam Stadium for another afternoon matchup with our A’s. Right-hander Luis Morales is set to get the ball for his second appearance this spring. He allowed a run on a couple hits in a couple innings of work earlier this week but will be getting his first starting nod. The Giants will go with veteran righty Tyler Mahle for his first appearance of camp. Hopefully the A’s can get another one of those currently-meaningless wins.\n\nMuncy finished the day 2-for-3 with three RBI’s. It’s a super small sample but he’s 4-for-10 so far with one walk and one strikeout.\n\nHernaiz isn’t making the coaching staff’s job easy though. He went 0-for-1 today but also drew a pair of walks. He’s 5-for-11 this spring. Does a big showing in the upcoming WBC do him any favors with the coaching staff?\n\nJamie Arnold sighting! The A’s most recent first-round pick made it into his first game action for the A’s. He pitched a scoreless inning, allowing a hit and a walk while also collecting two punchouts. A nice little spring debut for the left-hander.\n\nCenter fielder Denzel Clarke has had a rough go of it at the plate to start camp, but he finally collected his first hit this spring today. He doesn’t need to do much offensively to have value for the A’s this coming season but he also can’t be a complete black hole in the lineup.\n\nTop prospect Leo De Vries went 2-for-2 today, a positive showing for the young shortstop who is nearly in the big leagues. He won’t be breaking camp with the club but a strong showing in front of the coaches during camp doesn’t hurt.\n\nRighty reliever Elvis Alvarado had a second scoreless appearance this afternoon, while fellow relief pitcher Michael Kelly gave up a run in his inning of work. These two could be closer options for Mark Kotsay this coming year.",

    "description": "Upamecano has introduced Karl to the school of hard knocks.",
    "fullText": "The jump from youth football to professional football is always a very difficult one. Despite his successes for Bayern Munich during the 2025/26 season to date, the same is true for Lennart Karl. Lest we forget, his only minutes in professional football before this season were his 45 minutes in the Club World Cup. He has made the transition look easy with many, many phenomenal performances this season.\n\nBut Karl is still a slight, 5’5″ player. Asked by Kicker what the biggest adjustment going from youth to pro football has been, there was only going to be one answer:\n\n“The biggest differences are clearly the physicality and intensity; the training is much more strenuous than in youth football,” Karl said, as captured by @iMiaSanMia. “I can’t compare dribbling against a 17-year-old to dribbling against [Bayern teammate] Dayot Upamecano.”\n\nUpamecano has been mentioned several times by other Bayern players as a fearsome opponent to dribble against. The French center back is a very tough competitor and extremely tough to overcome in a footballing duel. But when Karl’s dribbles do come off against him, how does Upamecano react?\n\n“If something like that happens, I do get a reaction, but we joke about it again in the dressing room. Then it’s all good.”\n\nPart of being a professional footballer is being treated like one. Despite only recently turning 18, Karl is being treated like a fully grown adult by teammates a decade older than him, as Upamecano is. Perhaps that is another big difference between youth and professional football.",

    "description": "Tutu Atwell will probably be better for his next team than he was with Rams",
    "fullText": "I warned earlier this month that Tutu Atwell could easily be better for his next team than he was with the Los Angeles Rams:\n\nOne of the most disappointing outcomes of the 2025 season for the Los Angeles Rams was Tutu Atwell’s disappearing act. Atwell signed a one-year, $10M deal last offseason to return to LA after the expiration of his rookie contract. The receiver finished with six catches for 192 yards and a touchdown. The Rams effectively paid him $1.67M per reception or $52,000 per yard depending on how you want to look at it…\n\nAtwell is a good receiver. He’s performed well and has been productive when given opportunity, whether intentional or in a pinch because of injuries to others. Atwell plays bigger than his slight size and is one of the fastest players on the field when he steps between the white lines.\n\nWhile the Rams weren’t able to put his abilities towards their best use, I wouldn’t be shocked if another team can maximize his potential.\n\nWith the idea that Atwell could be a difference maker elsewhere in 2026 in mind, let’s turn our eye toward potential landing spots. Which teams would Rams fans not want to see sign Atwell?\n\nBuffalo made a significant stylistic change in their receiver corps from the early stages of Josh Allen’s breakout to today. Allen first made a major jump in his career trajectory when he was throwing to the likes of Stefon Diggs, Cole Beasley, John Brown, Gabe Davis, and Emmanuel Sanders. These players are mostly slight of frame aside from Davis.\n\nFast forward to 2025 and the Bills possibly overloaded on large targets in Keon Coleman, Joshua Palmer, Dawson Knox, and Dalton Kincaid. The result in terms of offensive production went the wrong direction.\n\nPerhaps Buffalo intends to return to the approach that worked best for them in the past. Atwell could work as a lethal deep threat that is also feisty for his size over the middle. He’s a natural separator that would add an element to the Bills’ offense they simply don’t have now.\n\nAtwell is not Tyreek Hill. While they are both fast players, Hill is a much better change of direction player.\n\nBut the Chiefs have attempted to replace Hill time and time again. They need a reliable deep threat in their offense and Atwell would probably work. Tyquan Thornton separated in the deep area of the field often but never seemed to be on the same page as Patrick Mahomes.\n\nCould Atwell patch this hole for the Chiefs in 2026?\n\nTyler Shough did enough to return as New Orleans’ start in 2026, but the Saints passing game never felt lethal last offseason. Shough is a fine short area passer. He needs to threaten vertically more often in order to take his game to the next level.\n\nAtwell is an interesting compliment to Chris Olave. The Saints are also in position to draft one of the top receiver prospects in Jordyn Tyson or Carnell Tate who would give them more of a size element. Atwell would be an interesting third option in their passing game.\n\nAtwell won’t break the bank in free agency. All three of these teams are cash-strapped and he makes sense as a target.",

I can only control what I can control, but I love being here.\"\n\nStamkos, 36, has drawn attention ahead of the March 6 NHL trade deadline.\n\nIn The Athletic's Feb. 26 report, the Tampa Bay Lightning, Dallas Stars and Minnesota Wild were mentioned as potential trade partners.\n\nThe Predators (27-24-7, 61 points) are coming off a 4-2 win over the Blackhawks that puts them within two points of the final wild card spot in the Western Conference. But even if Nashville makes the playoffs, they'd face a tough task going up against teams like Colorado, Vegas, Dallas or Minnesota in the first round.\n\nThat's fueled speculation that Trotz, who announced his retirement on Feb. 2, might be willing to sell off players like Stamkos to improve the team's future.\n\nAt least for himself, Stamkos doesn't see that happening.\n\n\"We want to play in meaningful hockey games and we're playing in meaningful hockey games right now,\" Stamkos said.\n\nThis season, Stamkos leads the Predators with 29 goals in 58 games, giving him 56 goals in two seasons with Nashville. The four-year contract he signed in 2024 includes an annual $8 million cap hit and runs through the 2027-28 season.\n\nPrior to his arrival in Nashville, Stamkos spent 16 seasons with Tampa Bay after being selected No. 1 overall in the 2008 NHL Draft. On Dec. 31, Stamkos scored his 600th NHL goal, becoming the 22nd player in NHL history to pass the milestone.\n\nROOKIE CONFIDENCE: Why Matthew Wood’s tying goal was 'biggest of the game' for Predators\n\nAlex Daugherty is the Predators beat writer for The Tennessean.

The right-hander has historically had issues with injury, missing most of 2018 and 2019 after undergoing Tommy John surgery, but has managed some solid numbers when healthy.\n\nHis first MLB season came with the Los Angeles Angels in 2017, where he made 64 appearances and had a 3.86 ERA on the season. Despite his limited number of appearances across 2018 and 2019, he had a 1.78 ERA through 26 games.\n\nMiddleton began to decline in the 2020 season, though, posting three consecutive seasons where he hovered around a 5.00 ERA. He made a little bit of a comeback in his last MLB season in 2023, posting a 1.88 ERA with the Yankees in 12 games.\n\nThe Dodgers made a point to establish some depth in their bullpen this offseason, and this is exactly the kind of move which could make a difference. If Middleton can rediscover the form he had prior to his injuries towards the end of the 2010s, the Dodgers will have another stellar arm to use in a reinforced bullpen in the coming season.\n\nThe post Dodgers Sign Former Angels Reliever to Minor League Deal appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

Bennett has racked up 277 runs at a strike rate of 135.78, dismissed just once in five outings, and currently sits second on the tournament’s batting charts.\n\nIn modern T20 cricket, where traditional anchors are increasingly rare, Bennett has quietly been playing the role for Zimbabwe with all the calm and cricketing brains it demands. Yet the 22-year-old begs to differ with the ‘anchor’ label.\n\n“I wouldn’t say it’s too much of an anchor role. I just try to do the simple things better ... to give Zimbabwe a good start in the Power Play and then sort of just carry on that momentum throughout the middle periods with the likes of (Sikandar) Raza, the guys who can hit the big sixes and stuff. I think I do go out there and try to play positive cricket and try to get at those higher strike rates. Sri Lanka was a bit different where the pitches weren't as good as they are here. So maybe that lower strike rate came into play.”\n\nHe doesn’t have the flash and flair of a power hitter, but that doesn’t mean he is any less effective.\n\n“I don’t really do much power hitting. I think for me, as more of a stroke player, I try to get into good positions ... If I’m in a strong position and I can get my hands to the ball, I get the best chance to hit those sixes,” said Bennett.\n\nEarlier on Thursday at Chepauk, he exactly demonstrated the value of timing and positioning when he muscled the world’s leading T20 bowler, Jasprit Bumrah over long-on to celebrate his third half-century in the tournament in an emphatic fashion. A shot that left everyone in awe.\n\n“I think Jasprit is always going to be a tough one to face. My thought process was just watch the ball as close as I can and just let my body do the actions. The ball was in my zone and I just hit it,” Bennett said.\n\nBennett also showcased an array of eye-catching strokes, including a clever scoop, against India’s decorated bowlers. “You practise those shots in the nets leading up to tournaments like this and the field normally tells you where the bowler is going to bowl. So the scoop was for pace-on yorkers. I thought that’s a good option with fine leg and third man up. Yeah, and it’s just literally keeping that clear mind,” said Bennett.\n\nZimbabwe’s breakthrough Super Eight will be remembered for many reasons, but above all, remember the name -- Brian Bennett.",

    "fullText": "NFL Combine winners and losers: Live updates on defensive backs, tight ends in Indianapolis originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe only bad news from Day 1 of NFL Combine drills is that Ohio State Buckeyes linebacker Sonny Styles isn't working out for the rest of the weekend. He stole the show on Thursday, setting an exceptionally high bar for the rest of the participants in Indianapolis.\n\nDay 2 of Combine drills will hope to separate the best defensive backs and tight ends from the pack. This class of defensive backs is defined by its biggest stars. Ohio State safety Caleb Downs is a sure-fire first-round pick, but several top cornerbacks sitting out of Friday's drills open the door for movement in the top 50.\n\nThe tight end position is more fluid. Oregon star Kenyon Sadiq is the runaway TE1. While the position is deep, it is far from settled, and strong testing numbers could push under-the-radar names up the board.\n\nWe'll track those winners and losers live as they run, jump, and drill their way to April.\n\nWinner: D'Angelo Ponds, CB, Indiana\n\nI was ready to write Ponds off as a loser, having measured in at the extremely small 5085 and 182 pounds. It's an outlier in the wrong direction, but I don't want to double-count it. Everyone knew he was among the shortest players in this class.\n\nIndiana CB D'Angelo Ponds just jumped a 43.50\" vertical😳pic.twitter.com/jO08foXmJV\n\n— PFF College (@PFF_College) February 27, 2026\n\nWhat we didn't know was that he was going to hit 43.5 inches in the vertical jump, the sixth-best mark from a corner since 1999, per MockDraftable's database. That kind of explosion is necessary to buy breathing room, adding margin for error that his frame steals from him. He needs to move exceptionally well to keep his stock in the right spot -- jumping out of the building is an exceptional way to start.\n\nWinner: Tacario Davis, CB, Washington\n\nFrequently, prototypical Cover 3 corners use their length to mitigate speed concerns. They might not have the quickest feet, but size can keep receivers at bay, too.\n\nDavis checked off both boxes, exceeding many expectations. At 6037, he's a pterodactyl, and the rest of his frame falls in line. A 97th-percentile wingspan and 95th-percentile arm length will have position coaches tripping over themselves until April.\n\nHe also ran well, posting an unofficial 4.41-second 40-yard dash. That's an excellent time for anyone, much less one who has some coverage questions to answer at the next level. If nothing else, his physical tools will boost his stock.\n\nIt's not a winner and losers column without the latter, but that isn't fair to TJ Hall. He wasn't expected to run his way up boards on the Indianapolis fast track. He did, however, run slower than every other corner at the event.\n\nWithout overwhelming size, Hall's lack of speed makes him a zone corner with mid-Day 3 aspirations. Fortunately, he moved well during the first batch of position drills -- he's not in free fall.\n\nWinner: Toriano Pride Jr., CB, Missouri\n\nThe other side of that coin, of course, is the fastest player at one's position. Pride put himself on the map with two blazing runs, the best of which came in at 4.32 seconds.\n\nMORE: NFL Combine 40-yard dash tracker\n\nPride is undersized at 5'10\", 185, but he isn't an outlier in terms of length. He showed off his burst during position drills, too. Speed of Pride's ilk doesn't hide, but showing out on this kind of stage is nice ammo in his argument to be a Day 3 pick.\n\nLoser: Emmanuel McNeil-Warren, SAF, Toledo\n\nA surprising underperformer on Friday was Emmanuel McNeil-Warren, who spent much of the process as a Day 2 pick before the recent wind of first-round rumors spread. Since the Super Bowl, the bar has been set for McNeil-Warren's Combine performance -- Seattle Seahawks rookie Nick Emmanwori.\n\nMcNeil-Warren, at 6034, 201, is slimmer than Emmanwori. His arms are slightly smaller, and his testing numbers look like they are going to fall pretty far behind. Seattle's star posted a 98th-percentile vertical jump and 99th-percentile broad jump. The Toledo safety had marks of 35.5 inches and 10'2\", far more pedestrian. In fact, 11 safeties had better vertical jumps in Indianapolis.\n\nHis first 40-yard dash clocked in at 4.55, albeit with what looked like a slow start. The sequel wasn't much better -- 4.53 seconds. Perhaps the Emmanwori hype was unfair, but this was a letdown, and it might push him back into Day 2.\n\nWinner: Lorenzo Styles Jr., SAF, Ohio State\n\nOhio State is taking over the NFL Combine. Thursday, Sonny Styles and Arvell Reese were headliners. On Friday, the other Styles brother was even faster, laying claim to the fastest man at the 2026 NFL Combine (at least for now).\n\nTwo 4.28-second runs are a \"call the family\" performance. Styles made himself money on the fast track and had the football world waiting on his second run. He delivered!\n\nWinner: Genesis Smith, SAF, Arizona\n\nThere's an argument to be made that no safety moved better than Smith on Friday. One of the class's only true free safeties, he showed the kind of dynamism necessary to take on that role at the next level.\n\nSmith had the best vertical jump (42.5 inches) of the group, the eighth-best mark for a safety since 1999. He's explosiveness personified, and it showed in his position drills, too. He was smooth, twitchy, and fast, making little of his 40-yard dash absence.\n\nSmith is a Day 2 centerfielder, a point he proved at the Combine.\n\nWinner: Dillon Thieneman, SAF, Oregon\n\nThere weren't any questions about whether Thieneman was fast heading into the Combine. The Oregon standout has plenty of explosiveness in his game, giving him range as a centerfielder and the burst to click-and-close underneath.\n\nThere's a difference between running a 4.45 40-yard dash and a 4.35 40-yard dash, though. His 41-inch vertical jump was the second-best mark among safeties. The 10'5\" broad jump was less imposing, but there was enough to hang his hat on for a positive day. Throw in position drills that saw Thieneman show off fluidity and footwork, and there was certainly a lot to like.\n\nIt wouldn't be all that surprising if Thieneman's testing puts him further into the Round 1 conversation, especially if others lose ground.\n\nWinner: Eli Stowers, TE, Vanderbilt\n\nWe have history in Indianapolis. No tight end in the history of the MockDraftable database (since 1999) has cleared 43.5 inches. Oregon's Kenyon Sadiq hit that mark. Moments later, Stowers beat it. By two full inches.\n\nWith a 45.5-inch vertical, it might not matter what Stowers runs. That short-area explosiveness defines his game and makes him one of the twitchiest athletes in his class. He's slot-bound, sure, but we learned with Evan Engram that being a tight end in name only is still a path to production in the NFL.\n\nIn the race for TE2, Stowers just took a massive leap.\n\nOh, and he also set the Combine record for a tight end broad jump (11'3\") before posting a 4.51-second 40-yard dash. Nice day at the office!\n\nSonny Styles scouting report: Ohio State LB could test into top five\n\nNFL Combine winners and losers from Day 1\n\nFive measurements to look forward to at the NFL Combine\n\nWhy is Jordyn Tyson skipping NFL Combine workouts?",

    "description": "OpenAI's record new funding round is all about fighting Google's dominance in AI. Elon Musk knew the threat back in 2015.",
    "fullText": "When Elon Musk committed big money to start OpenAI in late 2015, he wanted to create another AI company to stop Google from dominating this important field.\n\nWhile a lot has changed since then, the reason OpenAI exists still holds: Google has been working toward this AI moment for over 25 years, and it's the beast to beat.\n\nTake a look at the companies backing OpenAI, which raised a record $110 billion on Friday.\n\nOpenAI's largest corporate investors are fierce Google rivals that will benefit greatly if OpenAI manages to seriously challenge Google in the battle for AI supremacy and control over how digital information flows in this new era.\n\nIt's become \"everyone else against Google,\" in my view. Here's the breakdown:\n\nThe new big kahuna. Amazon is investing $50 billion in OpenAI.\n\nAmazon competes with Google in cloud computing. AI workloads have become the big new growth engine for this sector, and Google has been growing quickly.\n\nAmazon also rivals Google in product search, one of the most valuable parts of the online search business. Google has woven AI throughout its search offering, and Amazon is behind in this area.\n\nGoogle has been designing AI chips called TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) for about a decade. Amazon has a similar offering called Trainium—another huge area of competition.\n\nAmazon's $50 billion investment in OpenAI gets it several goodies that can help it fight Google.\n\nAmazon Web Services will serve as the exclusive third-party cloud distributor for OpenAI's Frontier business product, while jointly developing custom AI models for Amazon's applications.\n\nOpenAI will also use significant Trainium compute capacity to support advanced AI workloads and expand business access to its models via AWS's cloud infrastructure.\n\nNvidia agreed to invest $30 billion in OpenAI in this latest round.\n\nNvidia is the clear leader in AI chips, with its GPUs. However, Google TPUs have gained ground recently, with many of Nvidia's biggest customers also agreeing to either rent or buy TPUs. This could eat into Nvidia's market share and might slow its growth, if TPUs really catch on.\n\nFor its new investment, Nvidia also gets new goodies to help it fend off the Google threat.\n\nOpenAI is deepening its partnership with Nvidia by using massive new computing capacity to better train and run its most advanced AI models.\n\nThe new deal specifically centers on Nvidia's upcoming Vera Rubin systems and significantly increases the computing power available to run OpenAI models after they are trained. This is known as inference, and it's becoming the most important part of the AI chip wars.\n\nAlthough Microsoft didn't invest in the latest round, it has been OpenAI's biggest investor for years. Even after skipping this round, Microsoft likely owns more than 20% of OpenAI already and has a massive cloud-computing deal with the startup.\n\nMicrosoft is Google's original arch-enemy. Microsoft dominated the tech world before Google rose up in the early 2000s and took the web by storm.\n\nThese days, Microsoft competes with Google in almost everything it does, including cloud computing, business software, and search. (Bing lags far behind Google in search market share, though it still makes good money for Microsoft.)\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella is still trying to make Google dance, and OpenAI is key to this.\n\nWith Friday's new OpenAI funding round, Microsoft's existing deal with OpenAI won't change, including how they share revenue, handle intellectual property, define advanced AI, and Microsoft's exclusive rights to provide certain services.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "As someone who's lived in central Scotland all her life, I've noticed that tourists often base themselves in Edinburgh — for good reason.\n\nThe capital city offers a brilliant slice of Scotland, with plenty of historic sites, interesting museums, and scenic vistas.\n\nNo country is just its capital, though, and there's plenty to explore beyond Edinburgh itself. I've taken full advantage of the country's well-connected train system by going on countless last-minute day trips to historic hubs and quaint towns.\n\nStirling, Glasgow, Dundee, and St Andrews are my four favorite places to visit from the Scottish capital, and they're all easily accessible by bus and train.\n\nStirling is about an hour's train ride from Edinburgh, with a round-trip ticket costing £12. Although it's less of a tourist hot spot, I actually think it has a better castle.\n\nBoth fortresses are scenically perched on a hill, but Stirling Castle is less crowded and includes a guided tour in the ticket price. I also find the interior much more interesting.\n\nAnother historic site worth exploring in Stirling is the Old Town Jail, which is about a 10-minute walk from the castle. The \"performance tours,\" featuring actors dressed in period-appropriate outfits, really bring the darkly fascinating history of the Victorian jail to life.\n\nAlso within walking distance of Stirling Castle is the Settle Inn, Stirling's oldest alehouse. Dating back to the 1730s, it's the perfect place to experience Scottish pub culture, offering a friendly and cozy atmosphere in which to enjoy a whisky.\n\nI also love visiting The Wallace Monument, which is a short bus ride from Stirling's center. The towering Gothic monument is full of history about William Wallace — Scotland's freedom-fighting hero.\n\nThere's a 246-step climb up a spiral staircase to reach the top, but the panoramic view is worth the effort.\n\nGlasgow is Edinburgh's friendly rival, and although they're only an hour apart by train, they feel completely different. Edinburgh is traditional and tartan-trimmed, whereas Glasgow is contemporary and quirky. A round-trip ticket from Edinburgh costs £16.80.\n\nI recommend walking the mural trail, which is a route highlighting Glasgow's street art. The pieces are wonderfully eclectic, and even if you don't do the full trail, you'll likely pass a few while wandering the city.\n\nGlasgow also has many museums, including Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum and the Tenement House, which is a time capsule of an early 20th-century Glaswegian home.\n\nFor a more unusual option, head to the Sharmanka Kinetic Theatre, which is an art museum full of mechanical figures that perform kinetic shows a few times throughout the day.\n\nAnd look out for the Duke of Wellington statue outside the Gallery of Modern Art. In comedic Scottish fashion, locals often accessorize the Duke by placing orange traffic cones on his head.\n\nDundee is less than an hour and a half away from Edinburgh by train.\n\nAlthough it didn't always have much to offer tourists in the way of museums and attractions, that's changed over the past decade.\n\nJust minutes from the train station is the V&A Museum, which opened in 2018. The striking building holds a permanent Scottish design gallery, alongside ever-changing exhibitions — I once visited a fascinating one on the history of tartan.\n\nMy favorite Dundee attraction is the RRS Discovery, the ship that first took Robert Falcon Scott to Antarctica in 1901. The Discovery was built in Dundee and is now docked right next to the V&A. There's an interesting exhibition center, but the best part is setting foot on the ship itself.\n\nTo learn more about Dundee's history, head to The McManus art gallery and museum, and for a more in-depth look at the city's once-thriving jute industry, visit Verdant Works Museum.\n\nSt Andrews doesn't have a train station, so you either need to take a direct bus from Edinburgh for about £10, or a £10 train to nearby Leuchars and then a short bus ride from there. Either way, the journey shouldn't take longer than two hours.\n\nSt Andrews is right on the sea, and West Sands beach makes for a lovely walk, even in the winter months. Visitors can also explore St Andrews Castle and St Andrews Cathedral; both buildings are now ruins, but what remains is fascinating and picturesque.\n\nThe town is also famous for golf, with the Old Course — which is regularly used for the Open — being the world's oldest golf course.\n\nI'm not a golf lover, but I still think the course, which features a medieval-era bridge, makes a nice walk … particularly with a Fisher & Donaldson fudge doughnut in hand.",

    "fullText": "This interview is based on a conversation with Emily Susman, 42, a chef and cookbook author from Tulsa, Oklahoma. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI don't blame anyone else for my alcoholism — it was all on me — but I grew up in a family where beer, wine, and liquor were part of the culture.\n\nI'm half Lebanese, and every holiday and other social occasion centered on eating and drinking.\n\nAt 14, my grandfather handed me a vodka and tonic and said, \"This is the way to drink responsibly, surrounded by your family in the safety of home.\"\n\nIn college, I joined a sorority where we partied hard. During rush season, our older sisters presented us with bottles of hard liquor covered with ribbons.\n\nI was never far away from alcohol, whether I was working for my uncle as a bartender or establishing my own successful restaurant and catering firm in Dallas in my thirties.\n\nBut the bad habits really set in after I sold the business and started working with my husband, Drake, 43, at his gas-and-oil brokerage. I was in charge of the books and dealt with the ongoing financial stress by reaching for the bottle.\n\nIt got to the point where I was getting through a large bottle of vodka every few days. I'd hide the evidence in the pantry because I didn't want Drake to see how often it was happening.\n\nI'd use any excuse to drink, whether it was to celebrate the good times or commiserate with myself when something went wrong.\n\nThe tell-tale signs were there. I was overweight from all the wasted calories and my habit of eating more when I was drunk. I'd experience crushing hangovers, get the shakes, and vomit the morning after.\n\nMy family started to get on my case. \"This is a problem for you,\" they would say. \"You need to get your act together.\" Every time, I'd make an excuse. I'll tell them that I'd cut down after Thanksgiving or give up entirely on New Year's Day.\n\nInevitably, I'd be back drinking by Blake's birthday in the middle of January.\n\nThings got even worse when the pandemic began in March 2020. I was often confined to the house and passed the time drinking. I disregarded the needs of my body by not exercising and trying fad diets that weren't sustainable.\n\nThen, a month into 2021, I awoke from a particularly bad episode and stared at myself in the mirror. At 5ft 8in, I was 230 pounds and a size 16. I bawled my eyes out because I was so miserable.\n\nSomething changed. I came downstairs and said to Blake, \"I can't do this anymore.\" I sought therapy and had my last drink in early February.\n\nI realized the all-or-nothing approach that fueled my alcoholism could be redirected to something positive.\n\nIt was a simple process without frills. I took pride in reaching each milestone: five days, then 30 days, then 120 days, and so on.\n\nDistractions made all the difference, whether I was using adult coloring books, painting with acrylics, or even sucking on lollipops when I craved sugar or the oral fixation of drinking.\n\nBest of all, I reignited my love of cooking. I relied on my professional culinary background to make nutritious, balanced meals, which broke the cycle of binge-eating, restricting, and guilt.\n\nMy sensible diet, combined with simple exercises such as walking and strength training, helped me lose 100 pounds. I did it slowly and surely — losing around one pound a week — and now weigh 126 pounds.\n\nI'm a size zero to two and no longer hide my figure in baggy clothing. I've been sober for five years.\n\nAnother benefit is the amount of money I've saved. I found an app that took my average spending on alcohol of $30 a day to calculate that I've saved nearly $55,500 since 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, I launched my company, Emma Claire's Kitchen, the same year I got sober. It offers practical, tasty recipes and products, such as spices and, soon, mocktail powders.\n\nI'm a completely different person from the wreck I saw in the mirror that terrible morning. I love and value myself and am so grateful to Blake and the rest of my family for staying by my side.\n\nIt's scary to think that I nearly lost everything — including my life — to alcohol. I'll never go back to what passed as an existence, just getting through the day.\n\nI have a bright future ahead of me now.",

    "description": "JPMorgan workers can join a waitlist and follow multi-step instructions to buy a toy replica of the new building, which is already reselling for $500.",
    "fullText": "For JPMorgan employees, taking your work home just got a lot more literal.\n\nEmployees who got on an internal waitlist can purchase a $150 LEGO-style replica of the bank's new, $3 billion headquarters at 270 Park Avenue, according to screenshots of waitlist instructions reviewed by Business Insider. A source familiar with the product said the replica sets at the headquarters' internal gift shop sold out quickly when the building first opened. Representatives for JPMorgan declined to comment.\n\nThe bank has been a leader in Wall Street's return-to-office push, and the new building has cemented its commitment to in-person work in the country's financial capital. The scramble for a miniature version of the headquarters also shows how much buzz it's generated. 270 Park Avenue has taken on a life of its own — tourists will stop to take photos in front of the skyscraper, and TikTok is full of videos about the amenities\n\nBuying the toy is no simple process — employees had to get on the waitlist for the 1,903-piece set before February 9. Starting after 10 am on February 26, those on the coveted list had 72 hours to pick up their replica from the shop, which offers everything from JPMorgan merchandise to trendy olive oil.\n\nOnly the employee on the waitlist can pick up the set during the 72-hour window, and they have to show either their JPMorgan ID, a state-issued ID, or their passport. As of now, there are enough replicas for everyone on the waitlist, and any extra sets will be sold on a first-come, first-served basis after March 10.\n\nYet hope will remain for those who miss their waitlist window and don't snag one of the leftovers, since the waitlist will reopen after April 1, according to the screenshots. Appearances aside, the building isn't an official LEGO product, but rather made out of repackaged and \"re-used LEGO elements,\" the box specifies.\n\nThe resale market is already capitalizing on JPMorgan fervor: someone is selling what appears to be the toy for $500 on eBay. The product is 6.5 x 16.3 inches, according to the post, compared to the actual skyscraper's height of 1,388 feet. Multiple platforms, including Walmart and Amazon, are selling dupes of the duped building, though those toys have 3,180 pieces and a slightly altered design.\n\nJPMorgan's new headquarters boasts a suite of offerings beyond repurposed LEGO bricks. The building, which opened in October and can house around 14,000 employees, has an array of restaurants, a pub, a gym, and an ever-waving American flag, to name just a few amenities.\n\nWith its LED lighting display, the 60-story building has changed Manhattan's skyline, easy to spot from across the boroughs. Now, it's moving beyond architecture and subtly changing interior design for those few who can get their hands on the replica.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "The \"Glucose Goddess\" built a brand around her blood sugar balancing hacks. She said a few swaps to her diet boosted her mood, energy, and health.",
    "fullText": "One morning, Jessie Inchauspé, then in her 20s, grabbed her usual sugary breakfast on her way to work in Silicon Valley — and noticed something strange.\n\nWith a cutting-edge tech wearable, she could see her blood sugar spiking, then crashing, in a pattern that mirrored her bouts of brain fog, anxiety, and exhaustion almost exactly, she said.\n\n\"It might seem obvious today that what we eat impacts our mental health, but back then, for me, I hadn't connected the dots,\" Inchauspé told Business Insider.\n\nInchauspé was part of a pilot study using a continuous glucose monitor, or CGM. Once reserved for people with diabetes, the devices were being tested to see how food affected the blood sugar levels, and corresponding mood and energy, of otherwise healthy people.\n\nIt sent her down a rabbit hole. About a decade later, the rest of us are finally starting to catch up. Now, an online audience of more than 5 million people are looking to Inchauspé — better known as the Glucose Goddess — for advice on achieving steady energy and a healthy metabolism.\n\nCGMs have since exploded in popularity among athletes, CEOs, and ordinary people trying to lose weight or to feel less sluggish. Brands like the Stelo, a device from Dexcom that Inchauspé has partnered with, are available without a prescription.\n\nThey may not be for everyone, particularly if intensive tracking makes you feel trapped in \"sugar jail\" as one Business Insider reporter wrote about trying a CGM.\n\nDietitians caution that self-tracking can sometimes lead to overanalyzing normal biological responses as your blood sugar goes through natural spikes and dips throughout the day. The science behind blood-sugar \"optimization\" is still evolving.\n\nStill, Inchauspé said she's seen lasting benefits from understanding her blood sugar and making simple daily tweaks. Three of her top tips are backed by solid evidence to prevent blood sugar spikes and support healthy eating overall.\n\n\"Saying that glucose only matters if you have diabetes is to me like saying brushing your teeth only matters if you have cavities,\" Inchauspé told Business Insider. \"We all feel the effects of our glucose levels on a daily basis.\"\n\nInchauspé said her previous habit of starting the day with cereal or granola seemed healthy, but ended in an afternoon slump.\n\nShe reined in her skyrocketing blood sugar by switching to eggs, Greek yogurt with unsweetened nut butter, or a smoothie with protein powder.\n\nAfter her mood and energy dramatically improved, she said a high-protein breakfast has become a non-negotiable.\n\n\"Anchoring your day with a protein-rich breakfast that keeps you steady is really, really key,\" Inchauspé said. \"It changed how I felt. It changed how I ate, how I was connected to my body.\"\n\nStarting the day with protein, and including it in each meal, is a dietitian-approved way to get enough of the nutrient, although your exact needs will vary based on your weight and goals.\n\nWhole food sources of protein like dairy and eggs, combined with nutrient-dense choices like fruit and nuts, are more satiating for long-lasting energy compared to processed foods like shakes and bars.\n\nCarb-rich foods are often blamed for blood sugar spikes, but Inchauspé is quick to point out that carbs can be healthy.\n\n\"I love pasta, and I could never give up pasta, nor do I want to,\" she said.\n\nContext is key. A dose of fiber at the beginning of a meal helps create a softer landing when the carbs hit your system, slowing digestion so that blood sugar levels cruise along like a gently rolling hill instead of a roller coaster.\n\nInchauspé starts her meals with salad or other fiber-rich vegetables that support healthy digestion, topped with flavorful, low-sugar miso dressing\n\n\"It's not necessarily replacing things, but also just learning when and how to eat them so I can still get all the joy out of them with less impact on my glucose levels,\" she said.\n\nBetween meals, Inchauspé's go-to healthy snack is an apple with peanut butter. The dose of healthy fat and fiber helps to balance out the natural sugars of the fruit.\n\nShe found the combo of fruit and nuts leads to more stable energy than her previous daily snacks. She used to eat grapes, which can be healthy but have a fraction of the fiber, which means the sugars digest more quickly and prompt an energy boost that doesn't last.\n\nIt's just one example of how nuance and balance are crucial when it comes to blood sugar and daily health. Everyone's response to carbs can vary, and some people may be just fine with plain fruit — new research even suggests people have different \"glucotypes\" that influence how their bodies handle sugar.\n\nThat's why dietitians emphasize there's no one-size-fits-all diet for healthy eating.\n\nStill, Inchauspé's advice has garnered a massive following online, a clear sign that people are hungry for data to give them more control over their health. Scientists are still making sense of how the average person might make the most of blood-sugar tracking. For now, consider a common-sense approach to your diet, with plenty of room for nuance and the occasional treat.\n\n\"A donut is not the best thing for your blood sugar, but I would never tell you, 'you could not ever eat a donut ever again,'\" Inchauspé said. \"That would be ridiculous.",

    "description": "A court dismissed the Trump administration's proposed settlement to eliminate the SAVE student-loan repayment plan ahead of schedule.",
    "fullText": "Student-loan borrowers might not lose a key affordable repayment plan just yet.\n\nOn Friday, a court dismissed a proposed settlement announced by the Department of Education and the state of Missouri in December that would have eliminated the SAVE income-driven repayment plan ahead of schedule.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation called for phasing out SAVE by 2028. This latest update means that the department has to stick with that timeline, and it cannot eliminate the plan before 2028 without court approval or a lengthy negotiated rulemaking process.\n\nJohn Ross, Missouri's district court judge, wrote in his ruling that the settlement was not presented to the court, and that federal law allows courts to \"exercise jurisdiction only over cases or controversies,\" which he said does not exist in this case because both the Department of Education and Missouri have agreed on the outcome they're seeking without debate.\n\n\"It appears that there is no longer a live case or controversy sufficient to authorize the Court to enter a judgment on the merits,\" Ross wrote.\n\nThe SAVE plan was created by former President Joe Biden in 2023, and it intended to give borrowers cheaper monthly payments with a shorter timeline to loan forgiveness. The plan has been halted since 2024 due to lawsuits seeking to block it, and while Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation included a provision to eliminate SAVE over the next few years, the settlement would have done so much sooner than anticipated.\n\nRoss also wrote in a footnote that it's \"not lost on the Court that millions of borrowers who enrolled in the SAVE plan have patiently awaited clarity while this litigation has proceeded. However, that clarity must come from the Department of Education, and not from this Court, which is no longer empowered to weigh the merits of a case that is now moot.\"\n\nWinston Berkman-Breen, legal director at advocacy group Protect Borrowers, said in a statement that the court's ruling means the department can now move forward with relief under the SAVE plan.\n\n\"As of today, not only is there no legal barrier to delivering those rights through the SAVE plan, but the Secretary has a legal obligation to do so,\" Berkman-Breen said. \"The U.S. Department of Education must immediately identify borrowers who are eligible to have their loans cancelled under SAVE and instruct their student loan servicers to cancel those loans.\"\n\nA Department of Education spokesperson told Business Insider that the department is evaluating the court's decision.\n\nThe department said in December that, should the settlement be approved, it would not enroll any new borrowers in the SAVE plan, it would deny pending applications, and move the 7 million enrolled borrowers to other repayment plans. Those borrowers would have a limited time to prepare to make their payments.\n\nHave a story to share? Contact this reporter at asheffey@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "From the people who brought you avocado toast: We millennials are bringing the \"chaotic,\" \"unhinged,\" and other generational-coded words to ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "We're all aware of ChatGPT's overuse of the \"—\" emdash and of sentence constructions like \"It's not just X; it's Y.\"\n\nI would like to put forth two other terms that AI seems to overuse. They've become telltale signs of AI's peak millennial personality: chaotic and unhinged.\n\nIt's part of a bigger issue I've noticed with AI — it's full of millennial cringe.\n\nFor a while now, I've noticed those two terms used repeatedly when I use ChatGPT or other LLMs, like Google's Gemini. It got so bad that I recently had to explicitly tell ChatGPT to stop using the word \"chaotic\" while I was attempting to get it to write in the style of the \"jestermaxxing\" and \"frame mogged\" terms that have proliferated online.\n\nYou're probably familiar with the extremes of cringe millennial — that specific kind of online-speak from the 2010s. Things like \"heckin' doggo,\" \"adulting,\" \"smol bean,\" or \"I did a thing.\" It sounds outdated; young people make fun of us for it. (I confess to being a millennial.) I know, it hurts. I don't like it, either, but I accept that time comes for us all, regardless of peptide stack.\n\n\"Unhinged\" and \"chaotic\" are kind of on the cusp here — not totally as obviously timestamped as \"heckin doggo,\" and still widely in use by millennials and Gen Z alike (perhaps even Gen Alpha). Still, I think both words feel kind of dated by 2026.\n\nI'd argue that the origins of these terms' popularity come from classic millennial woke 1.0: the need for new adjectives to replace casual use of words \"crazy\" and \"insane,\" which can be stigmatizing to actual humans with mental illness. Copy desks at news publications discouraged the use of \"crazy\" in their style guides, while many people on social media instead used words like \"wild,\" \"chaotic,\" and \"unhinged.\"\n\nThat aspect is crucial because it directly affected the training data that LLMs were fed for the last few years. Ironically, the chatbot I've noticed uses \"unhinged\" the most is Grok, which was specifically designed to avoid wokeism.\n\nThere's something bigger going on with AI and millennial cringe. It's not just the chatbots — it's images and video, too.\n\nOne thing I couldn't help notice while playing around with Sora 2 was that when I would make a video of myself — using an image I supplied — it would always put me in skinny jeans. Not just me — it seemed to do it for everyone.\n\nSkinny jeans are a funny quirk, because you can imagine exactly how this happened — most of the human history of online video, let's say 2006 to 2019, occurred during a time when skinny jeans were ubiquitous. And then, suddenly, skinny jeans were out of style, a hallmark of out-of-touch millennials. But AI models, packed full of training data with skinny jeans, didn't adapt right away.\n\nI assume that's basically what's happening with all the cringe (a term that I am using even while accepting it's also slightly dated) millennial speak in chatbots. For a good decade, the internet was filled with \"I can't even\" and \"I did a thing\" as well as AAVE and gay-derived slang like \"yaass\" and \"AF\" adopted into the generic millennial lexicon.\n\nAnd all those tweets from 2010 to 2020, Reddit posts, and BuzzFeed articles ended up in the training data that informs how chatbots speak.\n\nHere's where I start to personally feel a little queasy about it all. I was a prolific poster during that time, both on social media and as a professional journalist, contributing untold terabytes of millennial cringe for future AI models to ingest.\n\nI'm not delulu (a Gen Z term that has already fallen off by now) enough to think I personally affected how AI chatbots talk now. It's more that I see myself like how an old boomer hippie thinks back on attending Woodstock and a few protests and believes they helped end the Vietnam War. Not exactly, but also, well, maybe kinda. I was there. I posted cringe. And now AI is doomed to sound like a version of me that makes my skin crawl.\n\nOf course, until it doesn't. This is temporary — AI will keep getting better, it will start to sound more like Gen Z cringe instead of millennial cringe as time passes. Sora will put us in barrel-legged jeans (are those out already?), or eventually skinnies will come back around, and no one will blink an eye. This article will be fed into ChatGPT (Business Insider has a deal with OpenAI), and maybe in the future, if you ask ChatGPT why it says \"unhinged vibes\" so much, it will use this for an answer.",

    "title": "Bill Clinton brushes off '20-year-old photos' in Epstein files and says he wasn't aware of sex trafficking",
    "description": "Former US President Bill Clinton addressed recently released photos showing him socializing with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.",
    "fullText": "At the start of his Congressional deposition Friday, Bill Clinton addressed the trove of photos of himself with Jeffrey Epstein released by the Justice Department last year.\n\nIn opening remarks posted on social media, the former President said he didn't have any knowledge of Epstein's sex trafficking operation — despite anyone's \"interpretation of those 20-year-old photos.\"\n\n\"I had no idea of the crimes Epstein was committing,\" Clinton said of the convicted sex offender, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. \"No matter how many photos you show me.\"\n\nClinton posted the remarks ahead of his closed-door deposition in Chappaqua, New York, before members of the House Oversight Committee, which has been investigating Epstein's connections to powerful people.\n\nIn December, in response to the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the Justice Department released several photos showing Clinton with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who is now serving a 20-year prison sentence for trafficking girls to Epstein for sex. The photos show Clinton and Maxwell swimming together in a pool, along with a woman whose face is redacted. They also show Clinton in what appears to be Epstein's private jet with a female, whose face is redacted, on his lap.\n\nThe photos also show Bill and Hillary Clinton at parties and dinners with Epstein.\n\nThe former president has long maintained he had no knowledge of Epstein's sexual abuse. Epstein occasionally visited the White House while Clinton was president, and Clinton has said he traveled internationally with Epstein on his private jet four times between 2002 and 2003, following his presidency, for Clinton Foundation initiatives. There's no indication the two were still in contact by the time Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor in Florida in 2008.\n\n\"As someone who grew up in a home with domestic abuse, not only would I not have flown on his plane if I had any inkling of what he was doing — I would have turned him in myself and led the call for justice for his crimes, not sweetheart deals,\" Clinton said in the opening statement of his deposition.\n\nMaxwell appeared to have her own relationship with the Clintons.\n\nShe worked to obtain funding for the Clinton Global Initiative, records released by the Justice Department show. Maxwell also said in an interview with Justice Department Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche last year that she was closer to Clinton than Epstein was.\n\n\"President Clinton was my friend, not Epstein's friend,\" she said.\n\n\"President Clinton liked me, and we got along terribly well. But I never saw that warmth, or however you want to characterize it, with Mr. Epstein — so I didn't see that,\" Maxwell said in her interview. \"I didn't see President Clinton being interested in Epstein. He was just a rich guy with a plane.\"\n\nBill Clinton's deposition on Friday follows Hillary Clinton's on Thursday. She said she didn't think she ever met Epstein. She has said she met Maxwell on \"a few occasions\" in social settings.\n\nRepublicans on the House Oversight Committee said they would publicly release videos of the depositions of Bill and Hillary Clinton, as they did with a deposition of Les Wexner, the billionaire founder of L Brands, who previously hired Epstein as a financial fixer.\n\nClinton's deposition marks the first time a former president has been compelled to testify to Congress pursuant to a subpoena.\n\nDemocrats on the committee say Clinton's deposition marks a precedent that should require President Donald Trump, who has also been photographed with Epstein, to testify before the committee.",

    "description": "The Pentagon is cutting ties with more elite universities, barring active-duty troops from attendance.",
    "fullText": "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Friday that the Pentagon is formally cutting ties with Ivy League schools and other top universities, barring all active-duty troops seeking graduate-level education from attending specific institutions.\n\nMilitary attendance at select schools will be canceled starting this coming academic year, Hegseth said in an X post, accusing schools of indoctrinating service members with an unexplained \"woke\" ideology.\n\nIt is not clear how this change will affect active-duty students already in the middle of multi-year programs.\n\nThe military's professional military education system has \"been poisoned from within by a class of so-called elite universities who've abused their privilege and access,\" Hegesth said, and have instead become \"factories of anti-American resentment and military disdain.\"\n\nElite schools, such as Princeton, Yale, Columbia, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have \"taken our best and brightest, the men and women who pledged their lives to this nation, and subjected them to a curriculum of contempt,\" the secretary said. \"They've replaced the study of victory and pragmatic realism with the promotion of wokeness and weakness. They've traded true intellectual rigor for radical dogma, sacrificed. Seek free expression for the suffocating confines of leftist ideology.\"\n\nThe Pentagon did not respond to Business Insider's request for specific details on Hegseth's allegations. BI also requested a full list of schools affected by the Friday announcement, which was not provided.\n\nIf a senior officer selected for graduate school is already a top performer, it's unrealistic to think a one- or two-year program would fundamentally change them, said Dan Maurer, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and associate law professor at Ohio Northern University who called the thought of such a sudden personal philosophical change \"far-fetched.\"\n\nHe also said it's valuable to have troops and civilians exposed to one another, as it helps bridge the ever-widening gap between American civilians and their military.\n\nHegseth made the announcement on X on Friday afternoon, just hours after using the platform to announce that the military's relationship with Scouting America (formerly Boy Scouts) will hinge on the nonprofit's acceptance of Pentagon requests to change the program, including halting DEI efforts and barring transgender youth from openly participating in Scouts.\n\nThese universities teach service members \"to despise the very nation they swore to defend,\" and enforce a \"creed of globalist submission,\" he said in the most recent announcement.\n\nA list of 33 schools undergoing DoD review emerged online last week after an Army JAG notified active-duty troops and prospective students that certain schools may no longer be available to them and advised troops to \"have a backup plan.\"\n\nThat leaked guidance noted that Harvard was \"fully off limits,\" a reflection of the Pentagon's previous decision to sever ties with Harvard University. Hegseth, who has a master's degree from Harvard, accused it of being \"one of the red-hot centers of Hate America activism.\" Other schools were marked as risks.\n\nOne prospective student on active duty who hopes to attend one of the schools previously marked for review by the Pentagon told Business Insider the latest announcement from Hegseth has deflated them and may contribute to their decision to leave the military early. They spoke on the condition of anonymity due to concerns about professional repercussions.\n\nA new review is forthcoming for \"senior service\" schools and internal war colleges, the secretary said, \"ensuring they are once again bastions of strategic thought wholly dedicated to the singular mission of developing the most lethal and effective leaders and war fighters the world has ever known.\"\n\nHe did not specify which institutions the review could include, though schools like the National Defense University and each service's war college could be targeted.",

    "fullText": "Paramount Skydance and Warner Bros. Discovery have made it official, and CEO David Ellison sent a memo out to staff about the merger.\n\nParamount said in an official announcement on Friday that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement with Warner Bros. Discovery, giving the David Ellison-run media firm valuable assets such as HBO, CNN, and DC Studios.\n\nNetflix, which was also vying for WBD, declined to raise its bid for the company on Thursday, effectively walking away from its offer to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets.\n\nParamount made multiple offers for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its film studio, HBO, and cable networks such as CNN, rather than the slimmer asset package Netflix had pursued. WBD accepted its revised $31-per-share offer that Netflix declined to counter.\n\nPolitics may have played a role in the bidding war. President Donald Trump publicly expressed disapproval of Netflix's bid, and Republican lawmakers sharply criticized the company at a recent congressional hearing, accusing it of promoting \"woke\" programming. Trump had also demanded that Netflix fire a board member.\n\nInvestor sentiment compounded those headwinds. Netflix shareholders had been signaling discomfort with the scale and risk of the acquisition for weeks, dragging down the stock. Shares rebounded sharply once it became clear that Paramount's bid was gaining momentum.",

    "title": "9 luxury totes that make schlepping easier, according to style editors",
    "description": "Here are the most stylish luxury totes actually worth the splurge, tested by our style editors over years of commutes, plane rides, and everyday life.",
    "fullText": "Any I step outside my apartment, I'm wearing a tote under my arm. You just never know when one quick errand is going to turn into a full day of shopping, catching up with friends, or traveling to the other side of town to satiate a random craving.\n\nI, along with my fellow style editors, have tested a ton of tote bags — like, a ton — but the best luxury totes have an edge over your typical carryall. Beyond acting as a way to carry your laptop, water bottle, and other daily essentials, they elevate your routine with thoughtful design details and quality materials that get better over time.\n\nA luxury tote is worth investing in because they let you take your whole life with you in style. The spacious interior comes in handy whether you're commuting to the office, making a quick trip to the store, or even flying overseas.\n\nIn this guide, we've rounded up our favorite luxury totes that combine lasting quality, intuitive pocket placement, and sophisticated style — the ones that truly justify the splurge. From sculptural suede to slouchy carryalls, here are the very best luxury totes we use for accessorizing with intention.\n\nThe Cuyana Easy Tote is a prime example of quiet luxury. It has a simple exterior, but after years of wear, the smooth, luxe Italian leather carryall has proven itself to be an utter classic.\n\nIt softens and develops character with regular use, making it the ideal investment piece for lowering its cost-per-wear. The unstructured silhouette adapts to whatever you carry — from a laptop and notebook to a water bottle and essentials — without looking bulky or awkward. Even better, the dual handle lengths let you carry it by hand or comfortably over your shoulder (even with a puffy coat on).\n\n\"Cuyana also makes several accessories, like the Classic Tote Insert, for organizing the interior of your bag,\" writes executive editor Sally Kaplan. \"These are great if you like a bit more structure or interior protection since the soft Italian leather is unlined inside. \n\n\"I've had my bag for about 4 years now and I've taken it on every vacation, flight, weekend trip, and long car ride in that time,\" she continues. \"It fits an unbelievable amount of stuff, but it also doesn't look floppy or silly if I just put a few things in it.\"\n\nThis kind of longevity, in addition to the refined minimalist design and pared-back hardware, makes Cuyana's Easy Tote a stylish option that you're bound to get plenty of use from.\n\nRead \n\nI know the KAAI Pyramid is a coveted design because I've seen it often imitated, but never duplicated. In my years of testing fine leather goods, I've never felt a smoother suede than the blue lining of this luxury tote. It serves as the ultimate protection against scratches for my laptop, and puts this structured design in a league of its own.\n\nWhat sets the Pyramid apart is how well it performs both on my commute and at the office. The scratch-resistant, water-resilient leather stays looking sharp through the hustle and bustle, and it usually earns me a compliment in the elevator.\n\nIt's also easy to keep organized, thanks to the interior slip pockets for easy-access essentials, and the fully zipped top makes me feel more secure wearing it on the subway. A nice little touch are the metal feet at the bottom, so I can set it down without the bottom getting dirty.\n\nIt also comes in multiple sizes, from the full-size tote to a Midi and Mini version — in case you have a lighter everyday carry but still want the same look.\n\nOverall, the KAAI Pyramid Tote is a splurge-worthy blend of modern style, substance, and enduring quality — a bag that feels expensive because of how it's made, not because of flashy logos. It's apparent the moment you pick it up.\n\nRead \n\nTumi is one of our favorite splurge-worthy luggage brands our team has tested. Its Contine Weekender manages to fit as much as a duffel and still feels comfortable to carry like a tote.\n\nThe sleek design comes with a ton of organizational features. \"A padded laptop pocket, a spacious shoe compartment, a water bottle holder, and an exterior zip pocket with card slots are just a few of this bag's ample pockets that proved convenient for organizing all my bits and bobs,\" writes style contributor Talia Ergas.\n\nAs a bonus, the shoe compartment is convertible. You can unzip its barrier and turn into a more spacious tote, allowing more room for a bulky makeup bag or puffy jacket.\n\n\"I'd use this bag for work trips or to take to more upscale destinations,\" she continues. \"The bag doesn't come cheap, but it's built to last: My husband has used his Tumi weekender tote for well over a decade (though his specific style has since been discontinued).\"\n\nRead \n\nThe MZ Wallace Metro Tote is made with a featherlight quilted nylon and comes with padded, reinforced handles, which really makes a difference on the shoulders after carrying this tote for a full day.\n\n\"It's easy to convert this tote from a shoulder bag to a crossbody because of the removable strap, and with so many pockets and colors to choose from it's just as practical as it is stylish,\" writes style contributor Rebecca Strong.\n\nLet's talk about those pockets: There are six on the inside and five on the outside, with still room left over for a 13-inch MacBook. \"I never have to worry about digging into the depths of my bag to find my phone charger, lip balm, or whatever else I might need at any given moment,\" adds Rebecca.\n\nGiven the softshell fabric, you can also easily pack the MZ Wallace Metro Tote flat and it won't take up too much space in your carry-on. If you do wear it to the airport, though, you'll be glad to find that its luggage sleeve conveniently slides over your suitcase handle.\n\nRead \n\nI'm sure I don't need to tell you that Coach is a reputable brand, since most people I know have seen a Coach bag up close at some point or another. But since the brand's Tabby has come back in such a big way, I want to give the Brooklyn 39 its flowers — because sometimes you need a rather large unlined leather hobo bag, in case you come home with souvenirs.\n\nThis luxury tote has that trendy oversized shape, which lends well if you're bad at packing light (like me). Crafted from Coach’s signature pebble leather, the bag has a relaxed feel, yet the slightly shiny finish makes it polished enough for formal settings. It's a stylish accessory on the weekend, but serves its purpose as a catch-all when you need it to.\n\nThe strong, malleable leather means you can stuff it to the brim with a laptop, bulky sweater, or 40-ounce water bottle, and it won't protest with any creases or cracks. \"The Brooklyn 39 is so roomy that I call it my Mary Poppins bag,\" says style editor Samantha Crozier. \"For people who like to take an extra pair of shoes to work, this will absolutely hold your heels while you commute in sneakers.\"\n\nThis is one of the most expensive options you'll find in this guide, but the price is justified by just how much stuff this Parker Thatch tote can handle. The huge main compartment and distressed leather means you don't have to be precious about avoiding scuffs or scratches, as other luxury totes demand.\n\n\"I've stuffed it with groceries, spilled iced tea on it, and carried it in the rain with no fear,\" writes style editor Samantha Crozier. \"And after every mishap, the Jack still looks great with its lived-in leather. It's hard to explain how relieving this cognitive shift is, but it's made me reach for this bag all the time.\"\n\nThe Jack immediately feels like a trusty tote you've had for years. With the soft, loosely structured shape and wide opening, you can toss in your everyday carry along with the kids' favorite stuffed animals, a backup pair of shoes, and that package you've been meaning to drop off at the post office. \n\nWhile it doesn't zip shut, you can still tie it closed to retain the boxy shape. Inside is a zippered pocket so you can avoid digging around for your wallet, and the D-rings next to the long drop handles let you add a crossbody strap or decorative key chains.\n\nWhen you add a belt to a luxury tote, you immediately have my attention. I love to see the accessories-wearing-accessories trend in an elevated fashion, so with all the recent press around the Kennedy family, it's a timely opportunity to sport this Tory Burch tote — named after the former president's sister-in-law, style icon Lee Radziwill. \n\nBesides its aesthetic value, the double faced design gives it a practical edge. These outer layers provide even more storage on the outside for dropping in your sunglasses or keys, and they snap shut so the profile stays slim. Inside, the main compartment flares at the base so you can comfortably fit your laptop, toiletry bag, and other essentials within its smooth, suede lining. Leave the belt undone for an intentional devil-may-care effect, or wear it clasped shut to add some structure.\n\nThe price tag is definitely considerable, but true purse girls know the Lee Radzwill line is a major component of Tory Burch's design archive. And if you're going to spend nearly a grand on a luxury tote, isn't it nice for it to have some cultural significance, too?\n\nIf I had to sum up my personal style, I'd call it \"alternative with a corporate job.\" The Hammitt Oliver Zip Tote fits that aesthetic. It's crafted with a buttery soft pebbled leather that feels soft on my skin, so it's comfortable to wear tucked underarm. \n\nHammitt's signature gunmetal rivets give it an edge over mainstream designer bags, yet it still has all the practical details one could want in a tote. For me, that includes a zippered top, exterior slip pocket for my phone, a key leash, and an interior drop pocket for small essentials like my wallet and lip balm.\n\nThe softly structured leather makes this the carry-all ideal for carrying bulky items like books, a toiletry bag, or a light jacket. If you're into the prim-and-proper tote with rigid corners and brassy hardware, look elsewhere. But if you want something that complements your all-black wardrobe and still looks polished, the Oliver is a dependable option.\n\nThis chic, tulip-shaped design from Parisian luxury brand Polène is one I keep seeing worn by stylish passengers on the train. When you untuck the petals it takes on a whole new shape, giving you a versatile luxury tote you can wear two ways.\n\nThe main design drawbacks of the Cyme Tote are its open top and the smooth, coated leather, which is prone to scratches if you're not careful. \"The bag does come with a zippered pouch that you can fasten to the interior, though,\" notes style editor Samantha Crozier, \"so when I take it on the subway, I keep my phone, keys, and wallet in the pouch and leave non-valuables like a sweater, a book, and a water bottle on the outside.\"\n\nAs with any trendy luxury tote, I've seen affordable alternatives pop up that sort of resemble its sculptural shape, only they lack the expensive-looking sheen of Polène's Italian and Spanish leather. The genuine article also has hanging tassels, contrast stitching, and two sets of handles, which let you tote it by hand or over your shoulder.\n\nGabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor: I've spent almost three years testing fine leather goods on the style team at BI Reviews, from legacy brand ballet flats to lesser-known designer handbags. I've found the quality of a leather tote is best proven over time, once the material either ages gracefully with soft signs of wear, or comes apart due to shoddy construction.\n\nBased on my discussions with industry experts, trend research, and an involuntary personal habit of clocking labels all over New York City, I curated this list to include luxury totes that balance functionality with sophisticated style.\n\nRead how the Reviews team tests clothing, shoes, and accessories at Business Insider.\n\nLuxury totes are built with quality materials and craftsmanship that you both feel and see — from full-grain leather that develops a rich patina over time, to reinforced stitching that holds up to stains and strains. Cheaper totes often use lower-grade leather or synthetics that can crack, peel or sag.\n\nBelieve me: I've collected my fair share of canvas totes, and they each served me well — until the rips, stains, wrinkles were too obvious to ignore, and a permanent leather tote made the most sense for someone like me who carries a tote everyday. The durable nature of the material lasts longer, and you can easily find a luxury leather tote with a laid-back style to suit quick errands (such as the Parker Thatch Jack).\n\nLook for luxury totes made in a tannery with a Gold rating from the Leather Working Group. It means the manufacturer is doing the important work of conserving energy, using fewer chemicals deemed harmful for the environment, and maintaining records on the source of its raw materials.\n\nThe grade of leather — whether top-grain, full-grain, or pebbled Italian leather — determines how it changes color, how it feels on your skin, and how well it maintains its structure. Luxury totes are typically made with higher-grade leather that resists scratches, instead developing a lovely patina.\n\nCost-per-wear is calculated by the purchase price divided by how often you use your luxury tote. If you carry yours everyday — and those days become weeks — it quickly increases in value, because the cost spreads out over hundreds of wears. This (eventually) justifies the the initial investment.\n\nSome do, if they become collectors items or come in a classic silhouette that transcends the ever-shortening trend cycle. It also depends on how well you preserve the quality of the luxury tote. Use a leather conditioner and store it in a dust bag away from direct sunlight. This not only makes it last longer, but gives you the option to have it appraised in the future.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

    "description": "Trump's directive comes amid a dispute between the AI giant and the Department of Defense.",
    "fullText": "The Department of Defense is moving to designate Anthropic a supply chain risk, a significant escalation by the government that could threaten how the AI startup does business with other US-based companies.\n\nIn an X post on Friday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that he would be directing his department to label Anthropic a \"supply-chain risk to national security.\"\n\n\"Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic,\" Hegseth said in the post.\n\nThe move, which amounts to a blacklisting of a US-based company, came shortly after President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies to stop using Anthropic's technology.\n\n\"We don't need it, we don't want it, and will not do business with them again,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Friday.\n\nIt comes amid a dispute between the AI giant and the Department of Defense.\n\nTrump said that there would be a six-month phase-out period for departments, including the Department of Defense, that are \"using Anthropic's products, at various levels.\"\n\n\"WE will decide the fate of our Country — NOT some out-of-control, Radical Left AI company run by people who have no idea what the real World is all about,\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's announcement comes just a few hours before the Friday evening deadline defense officials had given Anthropic to agree to the military's terms of use for the company's frontier model, Claude.\n\nEarlier this week, the two parties came to an impasse over how the military can deploy Claude.\n\nThe issue appeared to revolve around two safeguards Anthropic was not willing to drop: mass surveillance of US citizens and autonomous weapons.\n\nHegseth had given Anthropic's CEO Dario Amodei until Friday, 5:01 p.m. Eastern Time to get on board with the military. Hegseth also warned that the government could invoke the Defense Production Act — a wartime law that gives the president broad authority over a company's resources — and designate Anthropic as a supply chain risk.\n\nBoth would be unprecedented moves by the government against an American technology company, experts previously told Business Insider.\n\nOn Thursday, Amodei published a blog post stating that the Defense Department had added language to its contract allowing for \"any lawful use\" of its model.\n\nA source familiar with the negotiations told Business Insider that this language effectively gave the military discretion over how it uses Claude.\n\nThe Anthropic CEO said in his post that the company would prefer to continue serving the department but that it could not \"in good conscience accede to their request.\"",

    "title": "Defense Secretary Hegseth says military support for Scouts hinges on ending 'woke' merit badges",
    "description": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the policies of a private youth organization at a moment of high tension in the Middle East.",
    "fullText": "The Pentagon is pulling back on plans to cut ties with Scouting America, as long as the nonprofit organization adopts policies that echo new military directives, including eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and banning transgender youth from the Scouts.\n\nIn a video posted to X Friday, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said he had been \"very seriously considering\" cutting all military support to the organization, citing what he described as its failure to comply with President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at ending \"illegal discrimination and restoring merit-based opportunity.\"\n\nThe move is part of a growing Pentagon campaign to pressure private institutions like AI giant Anthropic, journalists who cover the US military and universities attended by troops to accept the Trump administration's policies and preferences. The move put the defense secretary in the position of telling a private youth organization who can join and what their application asks, and doing so amid a tense build-up in the Middle East that could see the US striking Iran within days or hours.\n\nMilitary support for Scouts has traditionally included logistics to the group's National Jamboree event (which is also a significant military recruiting event) and hosting of Scouts aboard military bases.\n\nThe Pentagon is essentially enforcing Trump's executive order, applicable to government agencies, onto private institutions, said Dan Maurer, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and associate law professor at Ohio Northern University.\n\n\"The fact that they're capitulating at all is a little weird to me, because they can withstand the loss of the connection, frankly,\" Maurer, a former Eagle Scout, said of Scouting America, expressing astonishment that the defense secretary personally focused on this. \"His attention could be focused on other things.\"\n\nScout leaders agreed to \"review and replace politicized, divisive, and discriminatory language throughout the organization,\" Hegseth said in the video, adding, \"no more DEI. Zero.\"\n\nMerit badges that \"mask\" DEI \"activism\" have been \"discontinued,\" he said, and a new military service badge will be added, in partnership with the Pentagon.\n\nScout participants will only be allowed to join based on their birth sex, which may amount to a ban on transgender youth.\n\n\"That means that the application, any application, will have only two sex designations, male and female, and the application must match the applicant's birth certificate,\" the defense secretary said.\n\nIt is not clear how many Scouts would be personally affected by such a shift, and it remains to be seen how families will feel about the Pentagon's involvement in setting terms of their organization.\n\nHegseth said he believed Scouting should return to being a boy-only group, but added that such a change is not imminent.\n\nIn November, an NPR report revealed the Pentagon was weighing whether to sever ties with the organization. As many as 16% of recent cadets at the US Military Academy have scouting in their backgrounds, a percentage that rivaled that of students from high school JROTC programs and reflected the Scouts' deep military ties. Many cadets were also Eagle Scouts.\n\nBeginning in 2012, \"the Boy Scouts lost their way,\" Hegseth said in the Friday post. \"A once great organization became gravely wounded. Diversity, equity and inclusion, DEI, crept in. The name was changed to 'Scouting America.' Girls were accepted. The focus on God as the ruler of the universe was watered down to include openness to humanism and Earth centered pagan religions.\"\n\n\"They even welcomed the destructive myth of gender fluidity and transgenderism to infiltrate their membership. Along the way, standards were lowered and merit destroyed in favor of an insidious, radical woke ideology that is anti-America and anti-American.\"\n\nThe Scouts said they had made changes to comply with the Trump administration's policies after months of discussion.\n\n\"Scouting America is proud to uphold our longstanding commitment to military families across the globe through a renewed, strengthened partnership with the Department of War,\" Scouting America said in a statement to Business Insider, referring to the Trump administration's unofficial name for the Defense Department that Congress has not approved.\n\n\"Over several months, we engaged in dialogue with Department leadership to align on how we could deepen our service to military families, while making programmatic updates to comply with Executive Order 14173.\"\n\nHegseth did not specify what policy changes he was referring to in 2012, though in 2013 openly gay youth were allowed to join.\n\nThe Boy Scouts adopted changes to address declining participation that was caused, in part, by thousands of decades-old child sexual abuse cases finally made public in 2012, said David Chetlain, a Navy veteran and former Boy Scout, who expressed concern about the Pentagon's pressure campaign.\n\nThe so-called 'perversion files' eventually contributed to Scouting America filing for bankruptcy in 2020. Opening ranks to a more diverse array of participants was part of the group's attempt to maintain relevance and cleanse its reputation, Chetlain said.\n\nVarious religious merit awards have been around for decades, he added, and reflect the diversity of the group, which has foreign members across the world. Two Japanese exchange scouts were in his own troop, he said, recalling his time as a young Scout in the 1970s and 1980s, and as an occasional leader since then.\n\n\"It's always been multicultural. It's always been agnostic to religion or accepting of all religions,\" said Chetlain, though he noted that Scouts previously barred atheists for decades. \"Even as a kid, I loved that inclusivity and having a place where everybody belonged and we were all accepted. And it was a safe place for me.\"",

    "fullText": "After years of internal buzz and false starts, Microsoft is considering rolling out its long-rumored E7 enterprise productivity software bundle, a pricier, AI-loaded version of Microsoft 365, according to two people familiar with the plans.\n\nMicrosoft 365 is a popular suite of productivity software that includes widely used tools such as Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Microsoft sells this software primarily in bundles called E3 and E5, where the E stands for \"enterprise.\" E3 is a more basic offering, while E5 has more bells and whistles.\n\nA larger, more expensive \"E7\" software bundle has long been rumored and has earned a kind of mythical status inside Microsoft, with employees and salespeople debating and guessing whether it will ever appear.\n\nMicrosoft's AI-packed E7 bundle comes as competitors like Google, Salesforce, and nearly every major software-as-a-service company rush to embed AI tools and autonomous agents into their products. Software stocks have taken a significant hit this year as investors worry that generative AI tools will upend traditional software products.\n\nThe new E7 bundle under consideration includes everything in the E5 bundle, plus AI features such as Microsoft Copilot and the company's new AI agent hub, Agent 365, the people said.\n\nMicrosoft is looking into per-seat and consumption-based pricing for E7, but could charge up to $99 per user per month, the people said. E5's current advertised price is $57 per user per month while Copilot is advertised as an add-on for $21 per user per month.\n\nThe company previously floated a new AI software bundle in 2024, but paused the plan.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "A midair crash prompted a bill that would have mandated new anti-collision alerts. Safety advocates say a revised GOP bill doesn't do enough.",
    "fullText": "Lawmakers appear to be at an impasse after the failure of a bipartisan bill that would have mandated something most airline cockpits still lack: a real-time view of other aircraft.\n\nThe ROTOR Act failed in the House by a single vote. It had passed with bipartisan support in the Senate and backing from families of crash victims of the January 2025 collision involving an American Airlines jet. It also had the support of pilot and flight attendant unions, airlines, and the National Transportation Safety Board.\n\nAdvocates say they will oppose a new GOP bill that does not mandate cockpit monitors.\n\nFamilies were unhappy with the bill's failure to garner the two-thirds majority needed to pass a procedural measure on Tuesday: \"It was defeated by eleventh-hour objections built on misleading technical claims the NTSB's own investigators have publicly refuted,\" they said in a joint statement.\n\nThe bill split House Republicans, with some of the 132 opponents saying the additional monitoring systems would be expensive and were unproven; some are advocating for an alternate bill, the ALERT Act, that leaves air traffic controllers primarily responsible for collision alerts and allows some military flights to opt out of transmitting their positions.\n\nAt the heart of the debate was a proposed requirement to equip commercial aircraft with GPS-based \"ADS-B In,\" which would display nearby air traffic on the flight deck screen — potentially closing the gap revealed by last year's AA crash with an Army helicopter near Ronald Reagan National Airport that killed 67 people. Overstretched air traffic controllers had struggled to track the mix of commercial and military flights in DC's crowded airspace that day.\n\nCommercial aircraft have been required to carry the sister technology, \"ADS-B Out,\" since 2020, which feeds their position to air traffic control. Think of it like ADS-B Out is talking and ADS-B In is listening. ADS-B Out has drastically improved safety by being more precise than radar and enhancing pilot situational awareness.\n\nSupporters of the ROTOR Act — which would also require certain military planes to broadcast their position in civilian airspace — argued that adding these monitors would allow pilots, as the last line of defense, to react to hazards when seconds count.\n\nIn comments shared with Business Insider, Syracuse University professor and aviation safety expert Kivanc Avrenli said the use of ADS-B In on the American jet would have given its pilots 59 more seconds to react before impact. In reality, the traffic-avoidance collision alert came only 19 seconds before, he said, and maneuver instructions weren't possible due to altitude limits.\n\n\"In dense airspace, that extra 40 seconds can be the difference between having time to sort out a conflict and having no real options left,\" he said. \"Delaying these upgrades means continuing to rely on systems that simply were not built for this kind of scenario.\"\n\nADS-B In would not only help in flight but also on the ground, where a series of runway incursions has exposed the limits of what controllers can handle in real time. In the months after the January accident, two separate military aircraft had close calls with US passenger jets.\n\nThe Pentagon initially supported the original bill. On Monday, it changed its position and said the technology risks \"significant unresolved budgetary burdens and operational security risks affecting national defense activities.\" Some Republicans came out against the bill and threw their weight behind a different effort.\n\nHouse Republicans Mike Rogers and Sam Graves, who voted no to ROTOR, have instead pushed a revised version of the bill.\n\nDuring a Senate hearing on Monday, Graves said ALERT would be a \"comprehensive package\" that would enhance military coordination and pilot training and address all 50 NTSB recommendations. He said the ROTOR Act only addresses two of the recommendations.\n\nALERT would not require ADS-B use — essentially maintaining the current system that relies on air traffic controllers to detect potential conflicts in and around airports and communicate with pilots. It would also absolve military aircraft of having to use the anti-collision technology in certain airspaces, citing security risks.\n\nGraves added that ADS-B In would be a burden to implement on the 5,500 planes in the sky, would \"unintentionally lead to an operational crisis in 2031,\" and be an \"unworkable\" mandate.\n\nNTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy — who oversees the research and writing of the agency's recommendations — said on Thursday that the House's ALERT bill is \"watered down\" and won't do enough to prevent future accidents, adding that the bill doesn't address all of the NTSB's recommendations because it takes out the ADS-B In requirement.\n\nThe NTSB has recommended ADS-B In on cockpit displays since 2008. The Federal Aviation Administration has never mandated it, partly because it lacks a clear funding mechanism. Regulators have argued that the system, which provides visual and audio alerts, would impose a cost burden on airlines and on private plane owners who may not operate in congested airspace.\n\nHomendy told a Senate Committee in February that American Airlines paid less than $50,000 per plane to retrofit roughly 300 Airbus A321s, as an industry example. That adds up fast across hundreds of aircraft. She said general aviation planes could carry portable receivers that cost as little as $400.\n\nSome airlines, including American and JetBlue, have voluntarily added ADS-B In to their planes.",

    "fullText": "BOSTON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - The Trump administration scheduled a Friday flight to bring a deported college student back from Honduras after a judge ordered her return, but she declined to board ‌the plane after U.S. authorities said they may detain and deport her again.\n\nAny Lucia Lopez Belloza, a ‌freshman at Babson College in Massachusetts, had been deported to a country she left when she was 8, after being detained at Boston's Logan International ​Airport while traveling to spend Thanksgiving with her family in Texas.\n\nThe 20-year-old was flown to Honduras on November 22 despite a Massachusetts judge's order the prior day barring her from being deported or transferred out of the state for 72 hours. A government lawyer later apologized for what he called a \"mistake.\"\n\nBoston-based U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns on February 13 ordered President Donald ‌Trump's administration to rectify the error it ⁠made during its immigration crackdown by Friday by facilitating her return.\n\nLopez Belloza told reporters she had been excited to learn on Thursday the administration had arranged for a flight to ⁠take her home.\n\n\"Hours later, that excitement turned into a nightmare,\" Lopez Belloza said.\n\nShe said a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer misled her by repeatedly telling her on Thursday that if she boarded the plane, she would be released upon landing in the ​United States.\n\n\"I ​believed him for a second,\" she said. \"I pictured stepping off ​of the plane and finally being free.\"\n\nYet in ‌court filings on Thursday afternoon, the administration said it planned to move to deport her again once she arrived. It said it had the authority to detain her if she took the ICE flight from Honduras to Texas because she was already subject to a final order of removal, which was issued when she was 11.\n\n\"I won't mince words,\" Lopez Belloza said during a virtual press conference. \"I am angry. I am sad.\"\n\nTodd Pomerleau, Lopez Belloza's lawyer, accused the administration of \"gamesmanship\" ‌and vowed to continue her legal fight.\n\n\"I'm not stopping until she's ​back here, but she's not coming back in handcuffs,\" he said.\n\nIn a ​court filing later on Friday, the administration said ​Lopez Belloza failed to appear for a pre-arranged meeting to assist with her departure and ‌did not board the scheduled flight after previously agreeing ​to come to an airport ​in San Pedro Sula, Honduras.\n\nA spokesperson for U.S. Attorney Leah Foley, whose office has been fighting Lopez Belloza's legal challenge, in a statement said the ICE-arranged flight was intended to restore the \"status quo.\"\n\n\"The status quo that ​existed prior to her removal was that ‌she was subject to a final order of removal and as the government argued throughout this case, ​ICE has statutory authority to detain an individual to effectuate such removal,\" the spokesperson, Christina Sterling, ​said.",

    "fullText": "Samsung just announced its new earbuds during the Samsung Unpacked 2026 event earlier this week, and Amazon is already offering a pretty sweet deal to preorder them. The Samsung Galaxy Buds 4 are $179.99 and come with a $20 Amazon gift card, and the Samsung Galaxy Buds 4 Pro go for $249.99 and come with a $30 Amazon gift card. Both will be released on March 11, but you can pre-order them now. Considering these will be their flagship earbuds for some time, it's a great opportunity for any Samsung fan or anyone curious about Samsung's new earbuds to snatch them up.\n\nSamsung wants to compete with Apple, with a similar design, features, and even price point. The Samsung Galaxy Buds 4 are strikingly similar to the Apple AirPods 4 in their design, with noise cancellation and the absence of silicone eartips that go inside your ears. They come with Hi-Res audio, IP54 for water-resistance, a Live Translation feature similar to Apple's, a new design, improvements in call quality, and direct access to ask questions to AI and receive responses through the earbuds. The controls are swipe and pinch, and the charging case comes in black or white.\n\nIt's also easy to draw the similarities between the Samsung Galaxy Buds 4 Pro and the Apple AirPods Pro 3. Apart from both being $249, the most obvious similarity is the in-ear silicone tip design that helps seal the noise and improve ANC. The Pros have all of the same features as the Buds 4, and are supposed to be more comfortable, have better ANC which Samsung calls ANC 2.0, have a better water resistance with an IP57 rating, which handles immersion in water up to 1 meter, and perhaps more importantly, a two-way speaker (as opposed to a one-way on the Buds 4) that is meant to delivers better, high-fidelity sound, superior separation of frequencies, and reduced distortion. But we will only know if these claims are true when we get our hands on them for a review.",

    "description": "Where exactly is he going?",
    "fullText": "For someone like the former prince Andrew the idea of jail probably seems absurd. He’s lived a life of impunity, no matter what he has done, protected by the British royal family he was born into. That’s probably why he looked so shellshocked in pictures taken outside the police station when he was released after being questioned for 11 hours. Now, with the investigation into his dealings with Epstein and his misconduct in public office, there’s a real possibility he could face jail time. And that, reportedly, isn’t sitting well with Andrew.\n\nRadarOnline.com is reporting that he is looking to hide “under the coat-tails” of his former fixer, David Stern. Stern, who was named more than 7,400 times in the new batch of the Epstein files, is reportedly living in Abu Dhabi. He is said to be a close friend of both Andrew and Epstein.\n\nCharles May Be Questioned by Police For Andrew's Arrest to See What He Was 'Aware' of: 'No One Is Beyond Being Asked'\n\nThe Fate of Beatrice & Eugenie's Places in the Line of Succession Revealed Amid Reports Andrew Is Willing to Sacrifice His Spot to 'Keep Him Out' of Prison\n\nEmails show Stern writing to Epstein: “I am always on your team!” and referring to him as “boss” and a “good friend.” He also informed Epstein of Andrew’s movements, sharing itineraries and details of trade trips. Now, a source close to the investigation into Andrew’s links to Epstein said: “The sheer frequency with which Stern’s name appears in the files has immediately elevated him from a peripheral figure to someone investigators regard as central to understanding how these networks operated.”\n\n“As a result, there is an active effort underway to determine precisely where he is based and to assess whether he would be willing – or compelled – to cooperate with any formal inquiries.”\n\nIt is not known if Andrew and Stern remain in contact, but there has been speculation that the former prince might seek refuge with Stern. He is currently in Wood Farm, at Sandringham, where he moved after he vacated Royal Lodge. An insider told the outlet, “If Andrew manages to flee somewhere like Abu Dhabi, it will make investigating him further very difficult. He is now basically being looked at as a flight risk.”\n\nAndrew was arrested on February 19, on his 66th birthday, and police have conducted searches in multiple properties associated with him. He is still being investigated for misconduct in public office due to reported communications he had with Epstein, where he shared highly confidential information that he knew because of his work as a trade envoy for Britain.\n\nThe maximum sentence for the offense is life behind bars.\n\nKing Charles released a statement right after his brother’s arrest, saying, “I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office. What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities.”\n\nHe added, “In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and co-operation. Let me state clearly: the law must take its course. As this process continues, it would not be right for me to comment further on this matter. Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.”\n\nThe 26 Best Romantic Comedies to Watch if You Want to Know What Love Feels Like\n\nThese ‘Bachelor’ Secrets & Rules Prove What Happens Behind the Scenes Is So Much Juicier\n\nBTS's 7 Members Were Discovered in the Most Unconventional Ways",

    "description": "Hyrox is the new Crossfit, and Peloton is still good-ol' Peloton.",
    "fullText": "If you've been eyeing a Hyrox race, but weren't sure how to train for one, Peloton may have just solved your problem. The fitness platform announced today the launch of a 12-week Hyrox training program, timed specifically for athletes preparing for the upcoming Hyrox NYC events taking place May 28-31 and June 4-7, 2026. And if you're not racing in New York, don't worry—the program lives in Peloton's library for all members, meaning you can start it 12 weeks out from any Hyrox event on your calendar.\n\nBefore diving into the program, a quick primer for the uninitiated. As my colleague Beth Skwarecki explains here, your friend who used to be obsessed with Crossfit is probably now obsessed with Hyrox (unofficially short for \"hybrid rockstar\"). Hyrox is a fitness competition designed for athletes who don't quite see themselves as pure endurance athletes or pure strength athletes, but something in between.\n\nWhat seems to make Hyrox unique—or at least, uniquely appealing—is its consistency. Unlike Crossfit competitions, where the format can change dramatically from event to event, every single Hyrox race follows the same predictable structure: eight 1-kilometer runs, with a functional fitness station in between each one. Those stations include things like sled pushes, wall balls, rowing, and ski erg work, adding up to roughly 5 miles of running plus eight rounds of serious effort. Because the format never changes, you can compare your finish time against anyone else who has ever raced Hyrox, much like comparing marathon times.\n\nBut one thing that sets Hyrox training apart from something like classic marathon prep is that it's inherently communal. While you can train for a race on your own with nothing but a good pair of shoes, Hyrox training requires access to a rowing machine, a ski erg, a sled, and a wall ball target—in other words, the sort of equipment that's hard to come by outside of gyms geared toward this kind of training. (For the record, most Crossfit gyms and a growing number of commercial gyms can accommodate these types of workouts, but it's worth calling ahead.) That shared training environment tends to foster a community that athletes say is a big part of the draw.\n\nPeloton's new 12-week program is structured around six training days per week, with many days including both a strength and a run component. Classes include strength, running, rowing, tread bootcamps, mobility and stretching, and meditation. As a regular ol' race runner myself, I’m drawn to the ways these classes cover so many different disciplines.\n\nWeek 12 is race week, so the training load lightens considerably as athletes taper toward the starting line. There aren't many workouts that final week, but one notable inclusion is a Hyrox pre-race meditation, which I find speaks to the program's whole community-based philosophy.\n\nThe program is grounded in five core principles that Peloton describes as the five pillars of Hyrox performance:\n\nAerobic Power: Threshold work starts on Day 1, teaching athletes how to manage effort and develop sustainable high gears over time.\n\nSimple Tools, High Impact: The program leans on running, the erg, and strength training as its primary vehicles for building hybrid endurance.\n\nEfficiency Over Speed: Rather than chasing raw pace, the focus is on smart pacing and clean technique that conserves energy across transitions.\n\nProgressive Volume: Training load builds deliberately over the weeks, developing the ability to perform under cumulative fatigue.\n\nPerformance Drivers: Recovery, fueling, and mindset are treated as training components, not afterthoughts.\n\nTaking a look at the program here, its structure reflects these principles in a clear arc. The first six weeks focus on building what Peloton calls the \"aerobic engine\" and establishing threshold control, laying the foundation before intensity picks up. By Week 7, athletes complete a 75-minute simulation designed to test their pacing strategy and transition skills under realistic race conditions. The final weeks then shift toward what the program describes as \"real demand\" training, simulating the fatigue carryover of heavy sled pushes and wall balls bleeding into running. Like with any good training program, the goal is to arrive at race day sharp and well-prepared, not worn down.\n\nNeedless to say, you need an active Peloton membership. And for now, the Hyrox program can only be joined from the Peloton app or Peloton hardware like the Peloton Bikes, Tread, Row, and Guide. You can’t join from the Peloton website or TV apps. To find it on your device, you can browse the programs area, find the Hyrox Training program, and hit join.",

    "description": "Unlock the full power of your Meta Quest 3 or 3S with these tweaks, downloads, and hidden settings.",
    "fullText": "Meta's strategy for its Quest 3 and 3S VR headsets is clearly to make virtual and mixed reality as easy, fun, and affordable as possible, but they might have done the job a little too well. All that user-friendliness has left a lot of power on the table. Casual Questers don't know that the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor is powerful enough to handle spatial computing and multitasking that rivals some laptops, and that they can link their headset to a PC for close-to-4K visuals that rival much more expensive headsets. With the right software and a little bit of monkeying around with (often-hidden) settings, you can take the Quest 3 and 3S way beyond its the out-of-the-box performance. Below are ten hacks every Meta Quest user should know to get the most out of their headset.\n\nIf you choose just one hack, it should be downloading Quest Game Optimizer. QGO is a third-party utility that lets you control a ton of hidden settings for any Quest game or app. Meta typically locks its hardware to conservative clock speeds to preserve battery and thermal headroom, but QGO lets you force the Quest's chip to work at its maximum power. Most impressively, it lets you to increase the internal render resolution up to 300%, effectively \"supersampling\" your games to match the high-fidelity density of the Quest 3’s pancake lenses. It really makes a difference.\n\nAs you might have guessed, you won't find QGO on the official Meta Store, and it takes some lightly hacker-ish work to set up. To get it running, you'll need to:\n\nPurchase the software. It's currently $9.99 on itch.io.\n\nCreate a developer account with Meta. This is free, and you can do it from inside your headset.\n\nEnable Developer Mode on your Meta account.\n\nUncompress the QGO app. Either sideload the compressed Android file on your PC using a tool like SideQuest, or unzip it straight in the headset using a file manager like AnExplorer or Mobile VR Station.\n\nGrant Accessibility Permissions within the headset to allow the optimizer to override system defaults.\n\nThat's the gist, but check out these deeper guides for how to do all of the above with just your Quest headset, with SideQuest and a PC, and through Meta Quest's developer's mode.\n\nYou can take the Quest 3 beyond standalone by linking it to your PC, either tethered or with a virtual link. This offloads the computing to a more powerful processor, turns your headset into a high-def display, and lets you use programs like Half-Life: Alyx or Microsoft Flight Simulator that would be impossible to run natively. You'll seriously be shocked at how good they look and how smoothly they run. You can do this in two ways:\n\nThis is the best choice for the highest possible fidelity visuals and the easiest set-up, plus you don't have to worry about how fast your wifi works.\n\nOpen the Meta Horizon Link app on your PC.\n\nGet a high-quality USB-C 3.1 cable or the Meta Link Cable, and plug it in.\n\nFollow the instructions on your headset.\n\nThis is the choice if you want the freedom of wireless connection and you have really reliably wifi.\n\nFor best results, connect your PC to your router via Ethernet, make sure your Quest 3 is on a 5GHz or 6GHz (Wi-Fi 6E) band, and use the Quest and PC in the same room.\n\nRun Meta Horizon Link on your PC.\n\nIn the Quest, go to \"quick settings\" and select the \"Link\" tile.\n\nSwitch \"Use Air Link\" to \"On,\" select your PC, and hit \"Pair.\"\n\nClick \"Launch\" and you'll be streaming directly from your PC to your face computer.\n\nMeta lets users test out \"coming soon\" features in its experimental menu and get an early look at \"quality-of-life\" improvements, most of which will be heading to the Quest soon. Among other improvements, the current experimental menu contains a couple of bangers: \"lying down mode,\" and \"Meta AI\" integration. Here's how to check it out:\n\nScroll down to the Experimental tab on the left-hand sidebar.\n\nToggle the features you want to try.\n\nThis brand new (as of February 2026) feature is evidence of how hard Meta is leaning into mixed reality. Spatial locking lets you anchor windows wherever you want in physical space, so you can look at your real television and see a virtual one, have three virtual monitors extending your workspace, or create a window to YouTube over your sink for when you're washing dishes. Bonus: The Quest will remember where these windows are when you restart it.\n\nMake sure you're in pass-through mode.\n\nGrab the window with the control bar at the bottom and move it where you'd like.\n\nSelect the \"anchor\" icon on the control bar.\n\nThis won't work with travel mode. But speaking of travel mode...\n\nYes, you'll look sort of dorky on a plane, but the Quest 3's travel mode makes it possible to use your Quest on the road by creating a stationary boundary, and setting the Quest to ignore external velocity and rely only on head movements. Here's how to turn it on:\n\nClick on \"Environmental Set Up.\"\n\nBigscreen Beta is the go-to video streaming app on Quest headsets. It allows you to sit in a highly detailed virtual environment—a cozy modern living room, a massive outdoor drive-in, another planet, etc.—and stream video. You can use the Bigscreen Remote Desktop tool on your PC to stream content from Netflix, Disney+ or just about anywhere else directly into your virtual environment. Not only that, you can stream content directly from Bigscreen into your private space, invite friends over to watch with you, or watch movies and TV with strangers in shared virtual theaters.\n\nIf you have an Xbox Live account, you can play (2D) Xbox games right from your VR headset, giving you a portable game console with a 100\" screen. Here's how it works:\n\nDownload the XBox app on your Quest headset.\n\nPair a controller with your Quest. Quest controllers aren't made to work with XBox games, so you'll have to use Bluetooth to pair a game controller to your Quest. You can use an XBox controller, a PS5 controller, a Switch 2 controller, and a ton of generic controllers.\n\nRun the Xbox app and choose a game.\n\nEnable passthrough. This lets you play your game on as big a screen as you'd like while still being in the \"real\" world.\n\nThere can be some latency, as the game is being run from the cloud, but it's surprisingly smooth in my experience.\n\nWebXR might be the Quest's biggest secret. It lets you use a seemingly infinite number of games and apps that are not available in the Meta store, and are almost all free. Since WebXR apps are browser based, all you have to do is point your Meta browser to a site that hosts a WebXR program and hit go. If you like experimental little tests and whatnot, you'll never run out. Here are some to check out:\n\nMoon Rider: A totally free, open-source alternative to Beat Sabre.\n\nSilkbrush: A web-based version of the famous Tilt Brush that lets you paint in 3D space.\n\nAbove Par-adowski: A surprisingly deep browser-based miniature golf game.\n\nYou can do a lot with your Quest without even turning it on. The Meta Horizon mobile app lets you manage your library, download games, change your settings, and more, all without strapping anything to your face. Browsing the Meta store feels way more natural on the app, and it's easier to navigate and change setting there too. Plus, the app can tell you how much charge is left in your battery, whether your friends are online, download screenshots and videos, and cast what's going on in your headset to another screen.\n\nThe Meta Quest 3 is ergonomically fine for shorter sessions, but if you wear it long enough, you realize how much the design is a battle between comfort and performance, and it compromises on both ends—it's kind of heavy and the battery life is kind of short. The front-weighted design puts pressure on your face and the battery life rarely survives a two-hour session, but there's a solution to both problems: Trade the stock fabric strap for a third-party \"Elite\" style strap with a built in extra battery, like the KIWI design H4 Boost or the BOBOVR S3 Pro. These move the extra weight to the back of your head, balancing the ergonomics, and they have swappable extra batteries so you can use your headset as long as you'd like.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Instagram User Should Know",
    "description": "Increase your privacy, remove annoyances, and reset your algorithm.",
    "fullText": "Ever since I deleted my Facebook account, Instagram has taken its place as the social network I visit most often to check what my friends are up to. I've been on the app for something like 15 years now, and during this time, I've learned a trick or two that improve the experience (or at least make it less annoying). Here are 10 Instagram hacks that will enhance your privacy, reduce the amount of junk in your feed, help you reset your algorithm, and more.\n\nOn every social media app, I like to set up filters to mute offensive keywords, but you can use keywords to block almost anything you don't want to see. On Instagram, you can use filters to easily block spammy comments and offensive messages. While you can customize your filter list, I just looked up a list of offensive phrases, and quickly added it to my IG account, then added a few additional terms.\n\nYou can do the same thing by going to your Instagram profile page, and tapping the three-lines menu in the top-right corner in Instagram. This opens the Settings and activity page, where you can select Hidden Words. It lets you add multiple words, as long as you separate them with a comma. Once added, Instagram will block comments and messages containing those terms.\n\nYou can also add mute keywords for posts appearing in your feed. Go to Instagram Settings > Content preferences > Specific words and phrases. On the Content preferences page, go to Sensitive content and Political content, and you can limit those types of posts and videos from showing up on your feed too.\n\nEvery once in a while, my Instagram algorithm goes haywire and I'm forced to reset it. After all, I mostly open this app to see my friends' updates and cat videos, and once my feed starts showing me too much Hyrox content (a \"sport\" I couldn't care less about), I know I'm in trouble. If something like this happens to you, there are two ways to reprogram your feed. The easy option is to just look for a reel you enjoy (such as a cat video), and swipe upwards a few times till you reach a non-cat video, then navigate away. Repeat this process a few times and your feed will be back to more cat videos and less Hyrox (or anything else).\n\nIf that doesn't work, or if your feed is too far gone in the wrong direction, then you can go to Instagram Settings > Content preferences > Reset suggested content to reboot it entirely.\n\nWhen you share any post, reel, story, or other type of content on Instagram, the app tracks who you're sharing it with, even if you send the link outside Instagram. You can see this by tapping the Share button on any post, and selecting Copy link: Paste this link in any text editor, such as Apple Notes or Google Keep, and you'll see that the link has tracking parameters at the end, such as \"?igsh=…\" or \"?utm…\". That helps Instagram identify that you've shared the link.\n\nThere's no way to disable this tracking, but you can manually remove it from each link before you send it to someone. Just paste the URL it as usual, then delete everything after the question mark.\n\nWhenever you open a link in Instagram, the app opens it in an in-app browser. This is the least privacy friendly option, as Instagram can then track which websites you're visiting quite easily. You can partially stop this by tapping the three-dots button in the top-right corner of Instagram's in-app browser and selecting Open in external browser.\n\nThere's no way to make this the default setting for all links, but you can set it as default for links you receive via DM. To do this, go to Instagram Settings > App website permissions > Message links and turn on Open in external browser.\n\nAfter you post something, Instagram loves to spam you with notifications every time a few people interact with the post. Even if you don't use Instagram for a day or two, you'll still get a deluge of notifications from the app. I don't face this problem because I never allow Instagram permission to send any notifications on my devices, but that's not an option for everyone. If you don't want to turn off notifications entire, you can choose to receive only the useful notifications from Instagram. To do this, go to Instagram Settings > Notifications and review all the options available to you. I particularly like the Messages only option, which only sends me an alert when someone DMs viaon the app.\n\nTo further limit notifications, go to the Following and followers section on this page, and disable Account suggestions. Similarly, you can go to Messages and disable Message reminders and all varieties of channel notification settings. You can also go to the Calls section and turn off Video chats, which has the added bonus of disabling video calls on Instagram, which I've never wanted to use.\n\nFor some reason, Instagram shows other people when you're online. If you want to be more discreet, go to Instagram Settings > Messages and story replies > Show activity status and turn the setting off. (On the previous page, you can select Show read receipts and turn it off to stop people seeing if you've read their messages too.)\n\nWhen someone is messaging you on Instagram, the app shows you an animation to tell you that the other person is typing. More often than not, this feature only makes me keep the app open longer while the other person types their message, which is probably why Instagram's added it in the first place. If you don't want to see the typing indicator in a chat, you can disable it: Open any chat in Instagram and tap the contact's name up top. Go to Privacy and safety and turn off Typing indicator. Sadly, you'll need to do this manually for each of your Instagram chats.\n\nInstagram chats are not encrypted by default, which means that the company can read all your messages. If you want to beef up your security, consider using end-to-end encryption for your chats. Just like Telegram, Instagram hides its end-to-end encrypted chat feature, and makes you enable it manually for each chat. You can do so by opening any chat in Instagram, tapping the contact's name up top, selecting Privacy and safety > Use end-to-end encryption.\n\nYour Instagram search history shows up whenever you try to search for anything on Instagram. This can be embarrassing if you've looked up something really silly (or slightly naughty), and someone else sees it. to prevent this, you can clear your searches by tapping the search bar in Instagram, and selecting Clear all, or tapping the x next to each search term.\n\nHowever, there's also a way to automatically clear your search history on Instagram: Go to Instagram Settings > Accounts Center > Your information and permissions > Search history > Keep searches for, and select 3 days, which is the minimum time for automatically deleting your searches.\n\nThere's no way to block ads on Instagram, but you can reduce the amount of your data that Instagram uses to show you those ads. Just go to Instagram Settings > Accounts Center > Ad preferences > Manage info. You can go through each option on this page and turn off everything you can. Under Categories used to reach you, select Remove on every option.\n\nYou can choose Don't allow us… in these two categories: Ads in other apps and Ads about Meta. Finally, you can select Activity information from ad partners > Review setting, and pick No, don't make my ads more relevant.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A crowd gathered at a commuter gate at Reagan National Airport on Friday as fog-laden Washington skies caused an hourlong ground stop that backed up passengers hoping to head out from American Airlines' Terminal D.\n\nBut soon the already densely packed area swelled even more, as word spread across nearby gates that, of the hundreds of air travelers coming and going, only one among them was accompanied by a U.S. Secret Service detail, along with uniformed local police officers: former President Joe Biden.\n\nBiden, who has rarely made public appearances since leaving office last year, sat, like many of his fellow passengers, awaiting a flight that would take him to Columbia, South Carolina, for an evening event with the South Carolina Democratic Party.\n\nPassengers whispered and gaped in wonder: Why would a man who for a time was leader of the free world be, like they were, at the mercy of airport travel delays, even as he sat ensconced in his security detail?\n\nMaybe for Biden it made more sense than for some other former presidents. Known for years as Amtrak Joe, Biden as a senator prided himself on becoming arguably the nation’s biggest Amtrak fan, regularly taking the train home to Delaware rather than taking up residence in Washington. Now, as a former president, he's been spotted riding the rails since, taking selfies with and chatting up his fellow passengers.\n\nOn Friday, the vibe was about the same, as Biden — seated in the third row of the tiny first class cabin on the commuter jet — boarded the flight ahead of other passengers, along with his detail, members of which were spread throughout the plane.\n\n“God bless you, sir,” one woman said, as she filed past Biden in his window seat, newspaper in his lap.\n\n“Thank you for your service,” a man said, shaking Biden's hand.\n\nThe woman who took the aisle seat next to the former president first set down her coffee on the arm rest they shared, deposited a bag in the overhead compartment, then sat down and realized her seatmate was the nation's 46th president.\n\nBiden set his hand on her cup to steady it, then met her gaze with a hello as she took her seat.\n\n“I feel like I'm about to cry,” the woman said, as they shook hands and, over the course of the next hour, chatted throughout the flight.\n\nFormer presidents and their spouses receive lifelong Secret Service protection under federal law, but there are no provisions guaranteeing the elite levels of private travel that were necessary features of their time in office.\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at http://x.com/MegKinnardAP.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Oura Ring User Should Know",
    "description": "This low-maintenance wearable has tons of hidden features.",
    "fullText": "I’ve been tracking my sleep and recovery with the Oura ring for nearly five years now, and today I’ll share with you several of my favorite and most-overlooked features—including one feature you should turn off, and one feature you can use even if your subscription is expired.\n\nThe Oura ring uses significantly more battery with blood oxygen sensing turned on. It may make sense to use this feature if you have a specific health concern, but most of us don’t need it on a daily basis.\n\nYou’ll find Blood Oxygen Sensing under the hamburger menu, and can turn it off from there. You’ll lose the “average blood oxygen” and “breathing regularity” metrics, but you’ll gain an extra day or so of battery life.\n\nI’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: the Oura ring is not a great workout tracker. Wearing the ring interferes with weightlifting workouts and it doesn’t have enough precision to seriously track other workouts like running.\n\nOura is a great companion to other workout apps, though. If you track workouts with another device or even with a phone app like Apple’s Fitness app, you can make sure those workouts get synced properly so they show up in your Oura timeline. Go to Settings, and then to Apple Health (iPhone) or Health Connect (Android). Turn on those integrations from there.\n\nAside from synced workouts, Oura will automatically detect workouts it thinks you’re doing. You’ll then see a card asking you to label the workout. Don’t just ignore those cards—Oura learns from your tags.\n\nSo if you went for a walk, make sure that activity is tagged as a walk. But sometimes it will tag another activity as a workout when it actually wasn’t. I’ve seen hair brushing and yarn winding tagged as various forms of exercise. Take a look at the time the activity was logged, and think back to what you were actually doing at the time. (You can dismiss the activity if it wasn’t a workout or isn’t something you care to track.)\n\nThe Oura ring only needs to be charged once or twice a week, but that means it’s hard to get into a routine of charging it regularly. I found that the perfect balance was charging it while I’m at the gym; some people prefer to charge while they’re in the shower.\n\nShort top-ups every few days are ideal for battery health. (Daily charging is arguably too much; only charging when the battery is dead is probably too little.) Oura recommends keeping the battery between 25% and 80% most of the time, if you can.\n\nSo figure out where and when is most convenient to charge, and keep a charger there. That’s why the charging case is convenient—you can carry it in your gym bag, for example. Unfortunately it costs an extra $99 to buy the charging case, but nobody ever said owning an Oura ring is cheap.\n\nThe Trends item in the hamburger menu is one of Oura’s best hidden features. Tap it and you’ll be able to see things that have changed over the past several weeks. For example, as I’m writing this, I can see that my resting heart rate has improved over the past 8 weeks, getting back to my “baseline” after some time in which it was higher than normal.\n\nIf you’ve been diligent about tagging behaviors and lifestyle factors, you can see their effects on your readiness, sleep, activity, or stress. For example, I’m curious whether my mood is better when I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter. Mood isn’t one of the items that Oura tracks, but I can tap Trends and then choose from Stress or Sleep or even Activity (all things that suffer when I’m feeling down) and see whether the days I tagged “vitamins” tend to correlate with higher or lower levels.\n\nMeal tracking was introduced as a companion to glucose tracking, but you don’t need to track your glucose to use the meals feature. Log your meals (you can even snap a picture of your plate) and Oura will give you feedback on how healthy the meal is, and keep track of whether you’re eating on a regular schedule or not. Calorie tracking is not involved. In fact, if you’d rather keep calories out of your Oura app entirely, check out the next item.\n\nOura will give you an activity goal each day, usually a certain number of calories. If you feel your goals are too ambitious (or not ambitious enough), go to the Activity screen and select Edit activity goal. You can choose a different goal, and you can also choose whether you’d like to see this goal in calories or in steps.\n\nIf you want to avoid seeing calories anywhere in the app, there’s a toggle for that. On the same screen, select Calorie opt out. This sets your target to steps and ensures that calorie mentions anywhere else in the app will be hidden. You can also access the calorie opt out from Settings and then Activity.\n\nOura has a Rest Mode setting that is intended for when you’re sick or recovering from an injury. (Oura may even prompt you to turn it on if your data indicates you may not be feeling well.)\n\nBut it’s useful for more than just that. Rest Mode pauses your goals, and stops giving you readiness scores. It’s great for any time you don’t want the app to bother you about what you should be doing. I’ve seen Oura users say they use it for days of their menstrual cycle when they aren’t feeling up to their usual activity; it’s also useful for travel when you know you’ll be stuck in a car or airplane all day, or when your sleep will suffer due to jet lag.\n\nIf you like to beta test new features, check out the Labs item in the hamburger menu. The offerings will change from time to time, but often they are new features in the making. Right now, the only offering I see is a blood pressure profile study, in which Oura is collecting data to hopefully offer blood pressure estimates in the app in the future.\n\nWhen I signed up for this, I had to fill out a questionnaire and sign a research consent. (Not all Oura Labs items are studies, but they can be.) I can see that Oura thinks I probably don’t have hypertension (correct) and that it’s basing that in part on my good resting heart rate and activity level. Other Oura features like meal tracking and Symptom Radar first made their appearances in Labs.\n\nThis is one of Oura’s lesser-known features: a web dashboard where you can view long-term trends, and a “membership hub” where you can download all your data. This spreadsheet download is available even if you don’t have an active subscription, but you do need a subscription for the trend viewer and for all of the software features I mentioned above.\n\nFor the web viewer, go to cloud.ouraring.com. Here, if you click on Trends, you can see all your data—five years’ worth, for me. You can even compare two variables and see a calculation that shows if they’re correlated. My sleep score and total sleep time are highly correlated; my HRV and sleep time are not.\n\nTo download CSV spreadsheets of your data (with or without a subscription), go to the membership hub and sign in. Select Export data and then Request your data. You’ll get a zip file filled with spreadsheets you can analyze to your heart’s content.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon will forbid members of the military from attending Columbia, Yale, Brown and other universities starting next school year amid a campaign to cut ties with institutions that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called “factories of anti-American resentment.”\n\nHegseth announced the policy in a video posted to social media on Friday, three weeks after he said the military was cutting ties with Harvard University. Without citing evidence, Hegseth said the universities have become “breeding grounds of toxic indoctrination” that undermine military values.\n\n“For decades, the Ivy League and similar institutions have gorged themselves on a trust fund of American taxpayer dollars, only to become factories of anti-American resentment and military disdain,” he said. “They’ve replaced the study of victory and pragmatic realism with the promotion of wokeness and weakness.”\n\nHegseth said the ban applies to Columbia, Princeton, Brown, Yale, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and “many others” without elaborating. He called for “complete and immediate cancellation of all Department of War attendance,” though it was not clear how broadly it would be applied.\n\nA message seeking further details was not immediately answered by the Pentagon.\n\nAs of Friday, Columbia, Brown, MIT and Harvard were still listed as eligible institutions in a Pentagon database for its Tuition Assistance program, which covers the full cost of tuition for active-duty personnel. Harvard had 39 participants in 2023, according to the most recent data, while Columbia had nine and MIT had two.\n\nThe earlier action against Harvard aims to block members of the military from attending graduate-level professional military education, fellowships and certificate programs, according to a statement released at the time. There are still questions about whether it applies to programs such as Harvard’s Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program.\n\nHarvard has offered a series of professional development programs and a small number of degree programs tailored to the Pentagon. Last year, it created a new master’s degree in public administration for active-duty military members and veterans. Hegseth earned a master’s degree from Harvard but symbolically returned his diploma in a 2022 Fox News segment.\n\nThe military offers its officers a variety of opportunities to get graduate-level education, both at war colleges run by the military as well as civilian institutions like Harvard.\n\nCampuses across the Ivy League have been a favorite target of President Donald Trump, who accuses them of becoming overrun by “woke” ideology. His administration has cut billions of dollars in research funding and attempted a number of other sanctions against the universities, often as part of investigations into allegations that officials tolerated antisemitism on campus.\n\nHegseth’s announcement is a rebuke to universities that had appeared to have reached a truce with the administration in recent months. Columbia and Brown were among the earliest universities to sign deals with the White House, agreeing to a range of demands in order to have their federal funding restored.\n\nHarvard is fighting back against such demands, alleging in lawsuits that the government is illegally retaliating against the university for rebuffing its ideological views. Last summer, Trump said he was days away from reaching a deal with Harvard, but negotiations appear to have fallen apart. Earlier this month, Trump said Harvard must pay $1 billion to the government as part of any deal, twice what he had previously demanded.\n\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "title": "The New Ultrahuman Ring Pro Has a Surprisingly Feature-Filled Charging Case",
    "description": "Using the charging case for extra features is a genius idea more smart ring companies should consider.",
    "fullText": "Ultrahuman just launched its newest ring, the Ultrahuman Ring Pro. While it’s not yet available in the U.S., I’m excited for this to come to the market. The real game changer here isn’t what’s on the ring, but what Ultrahuman has managed to do with the charging case—that is, a lot more than just charging.\n\nAccording to Ultrahuman, the new ring retails for $429 and has:\n\n15-day battery life—that’s more than RingConn’s battery life and about double Oura’s\n\nA faster processor that Ultrahuman says allows for more accurate data processing\n\nBreak points allowing the ring to be cut apart easily in emergencies\n\nPhysically, the ring looks similar to the Ultrahuman Ring Air, which I’ve previously reviewed. It has a smooth internal surface (no sensor bumps) with a small flat area at the base of the finger.\n\nWhat really intrigues me about this ring is not the ring itself, or even the fact that it has a charging case, but the fact that Ultrahuman is now using the charging case as a device in its own right. I haven’t seen anything like this from other smart ring manufacturers, and it’s a brilliant idea.\n\nFor example, smart rings can’t easily act as an alarm, because then they would need components that can vibrate or make noise—thus adding to the bulk of the ring and reducing battery life. But a charging case can easily act as an alarm clock, especially since you’re likely to have it on your nightstand already. (Ultrahuman’s app has an alarm feature, but it didn’t play well with my iPhone’s silent mode and I didn’t find it reliable.)\n\nThe charging case for the Ultrahuman Ring Pro also has LED indicators, can charge wirelessly, and has a USB-C port. The case has features for diagnostics and troubleshooting, including a button to hard reset the ring if needed. The case can also store up to a year’s worth of ring data and sync it to your phone later.\n\nAnd you know what else I love about the new case? It isn’t sized to the ring. The ring attaches magnetically to the pins on the post, leaving empty space around it if the ring is a large size, and less empty space if it’s a smaller size. If you ever needed to replace the case, you wouldn’t need to find one in your specific size.\n\nLegal action behind the scenes has been messing with the U.S. market for smart rings. About a year ago, there were plenty of options, but then Oura made the case to the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that it believes its smart ring patent covers the design of nearly every smart ring out there. The ITC agreed, and Ultrahuman was one of the companies that needed to pull its rings from the U.S. market.\n\nUltrahuman said almost immediately that it was working on a new ring design anyway, one that is so differently constructed that it can’t possibly run afoul of the ITC ruling. The Ring Pro appears to be the design it was referring to, with Ultrahuman conspicuously referring to its “unibody architecture” rather than using a design with a transparent lining (that transparent lining is one of the features of the patent at issue).\n\nIt seems there is still a possibility that this approach may pay off. A spokesperson told me by email today: “We are working through the necessary steps to bring Ring PRO to our U.S. customers and hope to share good news soon.”",

    "description": "About half of Japanese firms have an “old guy who does nothing.” Colleagues say they take many breaks, idly chat, browse the web, and stare off into space.",
    "fullText": "As corporate America and Europe drag workers back to five days in the office and squeeze for ever more efficiency, Japan is quietly paying thousands of older employees to show up, sit down, and do almost nothing at all.\n\nMeet the madogiwazoku cohort—older, underperforming, or redundant employees who are assigned desks near the window with little to no work to do.\n\nWhy are younger workers criticizing the madogiwazoku system?\n\nWhat is Japan's madogiwazoku window worker phenomenon?\n\nHow does Japan's employment policy protect older workers?\n\nWhat impact do window workers have on workplace productivity?\n\nThese “window workers” are mostly Gen X and boomer men in their late fifties and sixties, who were hired on the promise of lifetime employment shushin koyo and a seniority‑based pay system.\n\nInstead of leading teams or closing deals, they spend their days answering the occasional email, shuffling a few documents, and sorting paperwork—kept on comfortable salaries but carefully steered away from any real responsibility.\n\nAnd while the phenomenon isn’t anything new, it’s gaining interest online. As Western CEOs double down on productivity, five-day in-office mandates, and AI headcount cuts, more and more young people are looking to Japan for a calm alternative—even vacationing there for a taste of a slower, more intentional way of life that feels worlds away from the corporate grind.\n\n“[While]Trump says, ‘You’re fired,’ in Japan we don’t say, ‘You’re fired,’” a 74-year-old Japanese influencer who goes by @papafromjapan explained on TikTok. “If someone is not doing a good job, we put him near the window, let them do paperwork. Those people we call madogiwazoku.”\n\nA key distinction, he suggests, is that these workers aren’t office troublemakers—they’re often loyal, nonconfrontational workers who’ve simply been overtaken by changing technology or strategy. Rather than push them out, employers quietly move them aside.\n\n“They’re not aggressive people, so we just let them work, and they don’t complain, and they’re happy with it, and they work for the company for a long time.”\n\nProtecting older workers from redundancy—even when their roles shrink—has had a measurable ripple effect on who’s still turning up to work in Japan. The country now has one of the highest rates of senior employment in the developed world, with more than a quarter of people ages 65 and over still working in 2022, compared with less than one in five in the U.S., and barely one in 10 in the U.K.\n\nSurveys show roughly 80% of Japanese workers want to continue working after retirement, with around 70% preferring to stay with their current employer rather than start over somewhere new.\n\nTo make that possible, the government pushed through a revised Law Concerning Stabilization of Employment of Older Persons and a raft of subsidies that nudge companies to secure employment opportunities for workers until the age of 70. The World Economic Forum noted that already some companies are introducing systems that allow employees to extend their retirement age, enabling them to work longer without sacrificing benefits.",

    "fullText": "Mount Westmore, the hip hop supergroup featuring Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, E-40, and Too Short, is currently locked in a messy two-way legal battle over a branding deal that reportedly left a $1.3 million advance in limbo. The drama centers on a 2022 agreement with Westside Merchandising that was supposed to fuel a massive 60-date international tour.\n\nInstead of a global takeover, the group performed exactly three shows before the whole thing went quiet.\n\nNow, a Los Angeles judge has ordered the rap legends to sit for in-person depositions, proving that even industry icons can’t easily duck a subpoena when a million-dollar deal goes south.\n\nThe friction dates back to 2022, when the newly formed collective signed an exclusive deal with Los Angeles-based Westside Merchandising. According to court filings, the partnership was built on an ambitious 60-date run across America and Europe intended to move a mountain of branded gear.\n\nWestside claims it held up its end of the bargain by advancing more than $1.3 million to the artists to kickstart the campaign. However, the company alleges the group played only three concerts in 2022 and none in the years since.\n\nBeyond the missing tour dates, the company claims the artists ghosted them on required promotional videos and retail appearances.\n\nThe legal heat turned up significantly in October 2025 when a Los Angeles Superior Court judge shut down an attempt by Snoop Dogg and Ice Cube to avoid testifying. The rappers' lawyer argued that the deposition demands were \"harassing\" and \"burdensome,\" essentially claiming they had nothing new to say beyond what was already in the paperwork.\n\nThe judge wasn't buying it, calling their \"lack of knowledge\" argument inadequate and pointing out that both Snoop and Cube were actual signatories to the contract.\n\nThis means the icons cannot hide behind their busy schedules or massive brands to avoid being questioned under oath about why the tour evaporated. Westside is even chasing $11,000 in sanctions, accusing the defense of using delay tactics to stall the process.\n\nWhile the \"anchor\" stars of the group are being held to the fire, the other half of the collective is trying a different escape route. E-40 and Too Short have argued in their responses that they were never actually parties to the underlying agreement, even though their names are all over the litigation.\n\nThis creates a fascinating divide within Mount Westmore, as the members navigate their individual levels of liability for the unfulfilled 60-date tour. Westside attorney John Fowler has been blunt about the firm's position, telling TMZ that the case is simple because the other side allegedly defrauded his client. Fowler dismissed the group's recent legal maneuvers as a \"distraction\" that \"reeks of desperation.\"\n\nIn February 2026, the rappers officially flipped the script by filing their own fraud lawsuit against Westside Merchandising, their former business partner. This countersuit alleges that Westside misrepresented its actual retail reach just to lure the group away from a much larger merchandise firm.\n\nThe artists claim that, while they did receive an advance, they are still owed \"hundreds of thousands\" in unpaid revenue from sales that actually occurred. Their filing includes internal accounting figures they say came from Westside, listing about $808,000 in concert merch sales, over $90,000 in retail store sales, and $13,000 in e-commerce sales.\n\nDespite those numbers, the rappers allege they haven't seen a proper accounting of their full share of the profits.\n\nThis move is a classic strategic pivot: the defense is now using Westside’s own financial reporting as a weapon. By highlighting the $808,000 earned during those few 2022 shows, the artists are trying to prove the brand was profitable and that the vendor is the one holding the bag.\n\nTheir legal team has publicly accused Westside of refusing to cooperate or engage in good-faith discussions while calling the original fraud claims \"entirely baseless and without merit.\" It has turned into a classic \"he said, she said\" scenario, with both parties claiming to be the victim of a bait-and-switch.\n\nThe rappers are now seeking unspecified damages, claiming the alleged retail misrepresentations caused them major financial harm.\n\nThe outcome of this battle will likely hinge on whether the court views the failed tour as a deliberate breach or just a consequence of a flawed partnership. Many fans and industry insiders are watching closely to see if those missing 57 tour dates were the result of simple scheduling conflicts or something more legally problematic.\n\nFor now, both the original $1.3 million fraud suit and the new countersuit remain active in the Los Angeles court system with no final judgment in sight.\n\nThis saga is a giant flashing warning sign for the music industry. It highlights a growing tension between legacy artists looking to monetize their brands and the vendors chasing prestige clients. The message is clear: ambitious \"360-style\" deals only work if everyone has the bandwidth to actually show up.\n\nAs the rappers prepare for their in-person depositions, the focus shifts from the music to the fine print. Whether this ends in a settlement or a full trial, the paper trail left by Mount Westmore will be a cautionary tale for any artist thinking about signing on the dotted line for a \"super tour\" that might never happen.",

I was pleased with the game plan and how things unfolded.\"\n\nLeinster head coach Leo Cullen said: \"I thought that Cardiff deserved the win.\n\n\"I am disappointed for our guys, there was lots of good effort and intent but we could get into the game.

    "description": "As the eighth series of Netflix's hugely popular Drive To Survive is released this weekend, has Formula 1 become one big celebrity playground?",
    "fullText": "\"The paddock has now turned into a catwalk,\" says Susie Wolff of the exclusive area at Formula 1 races where teams, the media and guests gather.\n\n\"That's where everyone makes their entrance, from the celebrities, the girlfriends and wives of the drivers.\"\n\nShe's more familiar with the world of F1 than most, as a former professional racing driver, the managing director of female racing series F1 Academy and wife of Toto Wolff, the Mercedes F1 team CEO and principal.\n\nShe feels it's \"one of the few sports that's truly global and there's a glamour to it - it's part of the show and part of the appeal\".\n\nThat glamour has been a staple part of F1 throughout its 76 year history, with precisely engineered cars and luxury brands converging in desirable cities across the world.\n\nBut the sport now seems to be entering a new era of celebrity, fuelled by - and appealing to - a younger crowd; the stars favoured by Gen Z are joining the party.\n\nOne of the major influencers of this apparent changing face of F1 is Drive to Survive, the hugely popular Netflix show which returns for its eighth season this weekend.\n\nF1's new chapter can be traced back to 2017, when US company Liberty Media bought the racing business for $4.4bn (£3.3bn). Taking over the reins from British businessman Bernie Ecclestone after his nearly 40 years in charge, the company set its sights on modernising the sport, with more digital rights, social media promotion and new marketing deals.\n\nA year later, F1 stopped using female promotional models, or grid girls, and commissioned Netflix to make Drive to Survive, a fly-on-the-wall documentary series designed to give unfiltered access to drivers, their teams and the people who run them.\n\nThere was a clear mission to bring in new fans. In a sign of the impact, F1's own statistics show 43% of its overall fanbase is now aged under 35, up by 30% since 2018. YouGov research in 2023 said the latest Drive to Survive series had been watched by seven million people, with 18-29-year-olds making up 31% of the audience.\n\nWith the sport steering in a more candid direction, Wolff says \"the teams have realised it's more than just about the racing, it's the drama off track, the personalities off track\".\n\nAnd with plenty of marketing and PR opportunities from being seen at these events, an all-access pass to an F1 race weekend has quickly become the hottest ticket in town for any big-name celebrity.\n\nOpen the history annuls and you'll find celebrities and WAGs - the wives and girlfriends of drivers - visible in the paddock for decades. Think Nicole Schwerzinger in the late 2000s and early 2010s when she was associated with Lewis Hamilton. And more recently, ex-Spice Girl Geri Horner, the wife of the former F1 Red Bull team principal Christian Horner. Even back in the 1970s, the lives of drivers away from the sport were of widespread intrigue in the media, notably James Hunt.\n\nBut the 2025 season attracted some of F1's biggest names to races to date - with an arguably younger and more global appeal. Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Jennifer Lopez, Timothée Chalamet and Rosé and Lisa from BLACKPINK, to name a few.\n\nIn the new series of Drive to Survive, there are frequent shots of drivers' partners, such as Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc's fiancée Alexandra Saint Mleux, or Williams driver Carlos Sainz's model girlfriend Rebecca Donaldson in high fashion outfits.\n\nMatt Elisofon, co-host of the F1-focused Red Flags Podcast, tells the BBC \"there were more British celebrities in the Ecclestone era\". He references a famously chaotic interaction between late British rocker Ozzy Osbourne and F1 reporter Martin Brundle on a live TV grid walk at a race in 2003. Nowadays, you're more likely to see the likes of American actor \"Will Smith in Abu Dhabi\", Elisofon says.\n\n\"It's just taking on a whole new dimension that's a lot more global, a lot more Hollywood, Travis Kelce, Taylor Swift's fiancé is investing, Patrick Mahomes is investing [in the Alpine F1 team] which is relatively new,\" he adds.\n\nAs a new season rolls around, some fans have been speculating about whether Kim Kardashian will attend any races, after she was spotted at the Super Bowl earlier this month sitting alongside Ferrari driver Hamilton - himself long a trailblazer in F1 for unorthodox fashion looks and celebrity.\n\n\"I'm all about her being in the paddock,\" says Brian Muller, the other half of The Red Flags Podcast.\n\n\"So if Kim Kardashian brings her audience's attention to it - if 2% of her 400m followers say 'Oh, this is cool', that's how you continue to grow this thing and make it as global and powerful as possible.\"\n\nMuller, who is based in the US - where there are now said to be 52 million F1 fans - adds that \"F1 is still trying to find its footing\" there.\n\n\"A lot of my friends don't necessarily know what's going on, but when Beyoncé was in the paddock, I had friends who know that I do the podcast sending me that.\"\n\nMeanwhile, \"the WAG culture is only getting more powerful, it's only just started in terms of the agency that they have in making their own brand and finding a new way in,\" he says.\n\nThe pair refer to the increased celebrity presence at events as a \"gateway\" to entice casual viewers to commit fully to the sport. The YouGov survey from 2023 said 26% of Drive to Survive fans had no interest in Formula 1 itself.\n\nFor Wolff, celebrities attending races is \"brilliant for the sport\" - but there must be a serious side too.\n\nWolff's view is \"it doesn't matter which celebrity is in your garage\" during the race, when \"performance\" comes first.\n\n\"It's about balancing the two, having that sporting integrity.\"\n\nWhat many didn't predict was how popular the sport would become with women.\n\nBella James, an F1 content creator on Instagram and TikTok, feels the Netflix show has connected fans to drivers, making people care more about race results - but has also \"allowed women the same access men had\".\n\n\"It opened up the sport, there's car on track stuff but also personalities, fashions and brands,\" she says.\n\nWolff says she feels \"lucky\" to be involved in the sport at a time when, according to F1, 42% of fans are women, with the fastest growing demographic being in the 18-24-year-old age bracket.\n\nIn the past she says the sport was seen as \"very macho and very male dominated with big egos\", but, as she sees in the female-only F1 Academy series, \"society's changed... You can be feminine, you can be beautiful, and you can put your helmet on and be a fierce-faced driver\".\n\nThere's no doubt last year's F1 Movie, which became actor Brad Pitt's highest grossing film of all time, has also helped motorsport grow in popularity.\n\nFans are now looking ahead to the 2026 F1 race calendar which kicks off in Melbourne, Australia on 6 March - and many will be hoping for a repeat of drama like in 2021.\n\n\"The huge rivalry of Max [Verstappen] and Lewis [Hamilton] going for the title,\" as Wolff puts it.\n\nMillions watched that year as the title decider controversially went down to the final lap of the last race of the season in Abu Dhabi.\n\n\"What happened in Abu Dhabi, everyone in the world knew something had happened there - whether they were into F1 or not,\" says Wolff. \"Those were events that really helped open the sport up to a new audience.\"\n\nIn common with other moments in the Netflix hit before and since, when the showdown was dramatically retold three months later in the fourth season of Drive to Survive, yet another new generation of motorsport fans was born.",

    "fullText": "Tries: Hood, McIntosh, Lawler, Weaver 2, Golding Goals: Weaver 5\n\nAshton Golding scored on his Castleford debut against former club Huddersfield Giants to complete Tigers' first Super League win of the season.\n\nTries from Liam Hood, Darnell McIntosh and George Lawler had Tigers cruising inside the opening 30 minutes, but Jacob Gagai pulled one back just before the break to make it 16-4.\n\nTom Weaver then grabbed two crucial second-half tries, either side of George Flanagan's four-pointer, to put Tigers on the way to sealing a first league win under head coach Ryan Carr.\n\nThe biggest celebration of the night was reserved for Golding, as he crossed for a memorable first try for his new club against the side he left after five years at the end of last season.\n\nRichardson drop-goal earns York shock win at Hull\n\nArthur wants Leeds players to enjoy 'crazy' Vegas\n\nThe early season form and misfortune of the West Yorkshire rivals had mirrored one another before their meeting at the OneBore Stadium. Both had been winless, pointless and hit by injuries.\n\nCaptain Alex Mellor became the latest Tiger to be sidelined after he broke his leg in last week's defeat at Toulouse, while Giants were without a host of injured regulars themselves, including Liam Sutcliff, Joe Greenwood and Harry Rushton because of lengthy lay-offs.\n\nFrance international Tanguy Zenon started for injury-hit Huddersfield just two days after joining the club, while there were Tigers debuts for Wigan loanee George Hirst and former Giants pair Jack Ashworth and Golding.\n\nHood gave the hosts the ideal start, darting from dummy-half to grab his second try of the season after Joe Stimson was brought down close to the line.\n\nCastleford got a deserved second through McIntosh, who scrambled through a frazzled Giants defence that had been pinned back on their line after Taane Milne gave away a reckless penalty for his high hit on Krystian Mapapalangi.\n\nMilne was in the sin-bin when Lawler crashed over under the posts for Castleford's third try in the 26th minute, but after that it was Huddersfield who finished the half stronger, with Zenon denied by a try-saving tackle from Mikaele Ravalawa before Gagai eventually responded with a 38th-minute score.\n\nHuddersfield continued to threaten but were wasteful in search of a way back into the game before Weaver got on the end of a brilliantly weighted grubber kick from Daejarn Asi to edge Castleford 18 points ahead.\n\nFlanagan gave Giants renewed hope when he hit back soon after, but a second from Weaver put the result beyond doubt before Golding crashed over to spark wild celebrations.\n\nCastleford Tigers head coach Ryan Carr told BBC Radio Leeds:\n\n\"That's what we play for, we play to win and play for this feeling right now.\n\n\"I'm really happy for my team and really happy for everyone involved in our club because a lot of work has gone into getting to this point. And there will continue to be a lot more work.\n\n\"But to be able to see them with a smile on their faces, with all the hard work they have done since day one of pre-season, is enjoyable.\n\n\"But it is one win, we have to keep making sure we perform consistently every week now.\"\n\nHuddersfield Giants head coach Luke Robinson told BBC Radio Leeds:\n\n\"I thought we were rubbish, as plain and simple as that.\n\n\"We just robbed ourselves of energy with the amont of dropped balls that we had in that first half. The lads tried hard, but they were exhausted.\n\n\"I think they completed 100% [of their sets] in the second half, and we completed around 60-odd. If you just give the opposition the ball over and over again, you are going to get the same result.\n\n\"Eventually it just robs you of energy and you are basically playing on fumes.\n\n\"Look, they are running around, scrambling and trying their hardest but eventually it just comes back to bite you. We just need to learn and need to learn quick.\"\n\nCastleford Tigers: Cini, Ravalawa, Mapapalangi, McIntosh, Qaraqare, Asi, Weaver, Atoni, Hood, Westerman, Lane, Hirst, Stimson.\n\nReplacements: Lawler, Ashworth, Hall, Golding.\n\nHuddersfield Giants: Patolo, Woolford, Rogers, O'Donnell, Billington, Powell, Russell, Lolohea, Halsall, Milne, Gagai, Zenon, Flanagan.\n\nReplacements: Burgess, King, Rush, English.",

    "fullText": "ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Their family spent years opposing Venezuela’s socialist system.\n\nThe government retaliated by sending men to beat the father, a state oil company worker whom it accused of being uncooperative. Other relatives were threatened.\n\nThe situation became so untenable that the family fled the country for the United States in 2021 after it obtained refugee status, according to one of the daughters, a 24-year-old clothing salesperson who was interviewed by The Associated Press.\n\nThe six siblings and their parents settled in Minnesota in 2023, living peaceful lives until the Trump administration said it was casting new scrutiny on refugees. One priority is those admitted to the U.S. under former President Joe Biden, whom the government accuses of prioritizing quantity over detailed screening and vetting, with an initial focus on 5,600 refugees who settled in Minnesota and are not yet permanent residents, making them particularly vulnerable.\n\nLast month, three masked officers got out of a black SUV with tinted windows outside a St. Paul apartment complex, handcuffed the Venezuelan woman and her mother and told them their legal status was under review, according to the woman, who asked for anonymity for fear of retaliation.\n\nOverturning years of precedent, immigration authorities have arrested or questioned dozens of refugees in Minnesota, attorneys and advocates say, with more detentions likely to come nationwide.\n\nIn January, a federal judge ordered a temporary halt to the arrest and detention of refugees in Minnesota while a lawsuit challenging the “revetting” continues. The judge ordered the immediate release of all refugees detained in Minnesota, and those taken to Texas. On Friday, the judge extended the order protecting refugees in Minnesota from detention, saying the Trump administration policy turns the “American Dream into a dystopian nightmare.”\n\nA group of refugees in other states on Friday also filed a lawsuit seeking to block new DHS policies that could lead to the detention of tens of thousands of refugees who are lawfully in the U.S. but have not yet received permanent residency.\n\nThree refugees told The Associated Press that whatever happens, the rounds of inconclusive interviews with immigration authorities well after they thought their status was safe has them questioning their futures in the U.S. and living in constant fear.\n\nThe young woman from Venezuela hasn't returned to her job at a clothing factory. A man who fled persecution in Myanmar won’t walk on the streets of Minneapolis without a letter from his church appealing for immigrants to “be treated humanely.” A Congolese refugee arrested in St. Paul despite her refugee status says “everything that’s happened feels like a movie.”\n\nWelcoming refugees has been a source of bipartisan agreement in the U.S. since Congress passed the Refugee Act with overwhelming support in 1980.\n\nThe act helped make refugee applications some of the immigration system's most heavily scrutinized. Government decisions that someone was persecuted for who they are or what they believe are rarely second-guessed, and revisiting refugee status that's already been granted is a major blow to legal tradition, advocates say.\n\n“They’ve been heavily vetted and were admitted by the government with approval,” said Beth Oppenheim, chief executive officer of HIAS, a major refugee aid group.\n\nOnce a refugee is admitted to the U.S. through the resettlement program, the only way to strip them of their status is to prove that they should never have been admitted, Oppenheim said. That is why the Trump administration is interviewing people again, she said.\n\nMatthew Tragesser, a spokesman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said in a written statement refugees “are REQUIRED to be subject to a full inspection after a year within the United States.”\n\n“This is not novel or discretionary; it is a clear requirement in law,” he wrote.\n\nWhile it is correct that refugees must apply for green cards one year after admission — a change of status that brings a renewed layer of scrutiny — the administration is breaking with decades of tradition by revisiting initial decisions to admit people as refugees, and then detaining them while they are under review.\n\n“Arresting, detaining, and rescreening refugees are all new changes which will inflict grave harm on vulnerable populations,” said Smita Dazzo, deputy director of U.S. programs at HIAS.\n\nIn January, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement took the Venezuelan women to Houston on a flight where migrants were shackled at the wrists and ankles and forbidden from talking. The daughter said she was told she was there for green card interviews and isolated in a cold room with no food, water or anything warm to cover her. She said she refused to sign documents without an attorney present.\n\n“They told us, ‘Your status is worthless. You’re illegal,’” she said. “What we went through is something I wouldn’t wish on anyone … We were supposed to arrive in this country with refugee status, and we thought we would be protected here. But right now, at this moment, it is quite the opposite.”\n\nThe women were released after successfully filing habeas corpus petitions in federal court, part of a flood of last-ditch attempts at freedom under a Trump policy denying bond hearings in immigration court. Friends of their attorney drove them back to Minnesota at their own expense. Since then, the younger woman has been too afraid to leave the house.\n\nSaw Ba Mya James, a 46-year-old ethnic Karen father of three who fled military persecution in Myanmar, arrived in St. Paul last year after obtaining refugee status with help from a local church.\n\nDespite a pending green card application, the Anglican pastor did not attend church for weeks after friends advised him to avoid going outside.\n\n“I was told to stay at home, so I listened, and I prayed to God with my family,” James said.\n\nJames received a letter Feb. 2 ordering a “post-admissions refugee reverification” at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services St. Paul field office, according to a copy reviewed by The Associated Press.\n\nDuring an interview that lasted several hours, an officer pressed James with questions he said he already addressed extensively before being admitted to the U.S. The officer said the review was needed because an inexperienced employee handled James' initial vetting.\n\nWithin two weeks of the interview, James got another letter asking that he and his family provide fingerprints, which his attorney took as a positive sign.\n\nStill, James remains wary of being detained. He faithfully carries his church sponsors' letter appealing for him and other immigrants to “be treated humanely as fellow image-bearers of God.”\n\nA Congolese woman settled in the Twin Cities area in November 2024 with refugee status, working in the hospitality business as the breadwinner for her husband and four children.\n\nShe said an immigration officer approached her parked car when she arrived for work at 7 a.m. on Jan. 14 in St. Paul, saying he knew her name and that she was a refugee. After telling her to exit the vehicle to answer questions, he handcuffed her despite her efforts to show a work authorization document and identification.\n\nThe woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she fears reprisals, was flown to Houston to be questioned in detail about her experiences in the Congo, Uganda and the United States. She and other refugees refused to sign documents to be sent back to their home countries. She was released Jan. 18 without any ID documents to book a flight to Minneapolis. A manager at her company flew to Houston and drove her 17 hours back home.\n\n“If I told you I’m feeling OK, I’d be lying to you,” she said.",

    "fullText": "Tries: Vellacott 2, Bradbury, Paterson Cons: Thompson 2\n\nTries: Roberts 2, Lousi Cons: Leggatt-Jones 2\n\nEdinburgh battled past a spirited Scarlets side to secure a crucial bonus-point win in their bid to reach the United Rugby Championship play-offs.\n\nJoe Roberts and Sam Lousi crossed to give Scarlets an early 14-point lead, with Ben Vellacott halving the deficit with a try before half-time.\n\nA try from Magnus Bradbury and another from Vellacott swung the momentum in Edinburgh's favour after the break and, although Roberts' second try drew Scarlets level, Harry Paterson's try for the hosts proved decisive.\n\nSitting 13th and 15th respectively in the table coming into the match, both sides knew the importance of a win if they are to mount a realistic bid to reach the top eight.\n\nThe visitors started the brighter and camped themselves in the Edinburgh half for the opening quarter without finding a way through.\n\nThat was until Roberts sold a dummy and ghosted through all too easily to run it in from halfway.\n\nThings got better for the Welsh side when Lousi burrowed over in the corner to round off a period of pressure and establish a 14-point lead.\n\nEdinburgh needed a response and they got it when Wes Goosen jinked his way through the Scarlets defence and put Vellacott away to score.\n\nTrailing by seven at the break, Edinburgh came out firing early in the second half and struck with two quick tries.\n\nPaterson launched a counter-attack from deep and a succession of offloads and carries took Edinburgh into the red zone. The ball was spun wide to Bradbury and the big number eight did well to collect the pass and power his way through to the line.\n\nRoss Thompson converted to level things up and Edinburgh were soon in the lead for the first time.\n\nGoosen did brilliantly to ride a couple of tackles and link up with Lang, who sent Vellacott scampering away for his second try of the evening.\n\nEdinburgh were on top, but their momentum was checked when Paterson was sent to the sin-bin for a deliberate knock-on.\n\nScarlets wasted little time in making their numerical advantage count, slinging the ball wide for Roberts to force himself over for his second try to level things up again at 19-19.\n\nPaterson had barely returned to the action when he came up with Edinburgh's fourth try.\n\nThe full-back launched a bomb downfield, Leggatt-Jones made a mess of his return kick to allow Paterson to charge down, gather and go over for the try that sealed the win for Edinburgh.\n\nThe bonus-point victory moves Edinburgh up to 11th in the URC table before Saturday's matches, with Scarlets remaining in 15th.",

    "title": "Unions privately urge Chuck Schumer and Democratic leaders to stay out of Maine's Senate primary",
    "description": "Union leaders in recent days have urged Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N",
    "fullText": "Union leaders in recent days have urged Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to end their support for Gov. Janet Mills in Maine’s Senate primary, pointing to what they see as her weaker record with labor.\n\nUnited Auto Workers President Shawn Fain had a conversation with Schumer this month to discuss the race, among other topics, two people familiar with the call told NBC News. The UAW is supporting Mills’ opponent, Democrat Graham Platner, while Schumer and the DSCC are supporting Mills.\n\nA person familiar with the call said Fain discussed with Schumer what he views as the “shortcomings” in Democratic leaders’ approach to the 2026 midterms, “particularly their failure to adequately listen to working-class voters.” Fain cited the Maine contest as an example, this person said.\n\nSeparately, on Monday, Michael Monahan, international vice president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers’ 2nd District, which includes Maine, sent a letter to DSCC leadership, obtained by NBC News, “to express our deep concern regarding the DSCC’s ongoing involvement in the 2026 Maine Democratic Senate Primary.”\n\n“We strongly urge the DSCC to refrain from intervening further in this primary,” Monahan wrote, adding, “Your committee’s support for Janet Mills is troubling to our membership for several reasons.”\n\nMonahan called Mills’ record with labor unions “fraught.” He pointed to public polling showing Platner leading Mills and argued that money spent against Platner could weaken him for the general election against Republican Sen. Susan Collins.\n\nThe Maine race is perhaps Democrats’ best opportunity to flip a Republican-held Senate seat this fall, and it’s a must-win for them to have any chance of taking over the chamber. While the national Democratic establishment has thrown its support behind Mills, labor’s push highlights some of the base’s discontent with that decision — and the resiliency of Platner, who has weathered controversies.\n\nPlatner announced his candidacy in August, and Mills jumped in two months later, sparking a primary that embodies Democrats’ generational and ideological divides.\n\nA University of New Hampshire poll conducted in mid-February found Platner with a 38-point lead over Mills among likely Democratic primary voters, well beyond the survey’s margin of error. The Mills campaign disputed the survey in a memo, pointing to other recent misses the survey had in Maine and arguing that the sample, which skewed much younger than past Maine electorates, did not accurately reflect the state.\n\nThe June 9 primary is competitive even as Platner faced some blowback over a series of damaging revelations early in his campaign.\n\nLast year, Platner, an oyster farmer and military veteran, apologized for a string of offensive comments he made in past Reddit posts and covered up a tattoo on his chest that has a Nazi association — one he said he was unaware of when he got the tattoo. On Thursday, Platner was pressed at length on a podcast about his explanation for the tattoo.\n\nBut Platner and his energetic campaign have rallied more union support. He has also been endorsed by Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I.\n\nPlatner’s union backers include the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. David Sullivan, the union’s general vice president of the eastern territory, told NBC News he is set to have a Zoom call with the DSCC to discuss the race next week. He said his membership was upset about Democratic leaders’ backing Mills after his union had endorsed Platner.\n\n“So I called my people in D.C. and said, ‘Schumer needs to stay out of Maine,’” Sullivan said, adding: “They said they were going to stick by their guns and they were going to put millions of dollars in for Janet Mills. … We’re going to fight this all the way.”\n\nMills’ campaign highlighted a number of pro-labor efforts she has supported in recent years, including increasing the minimum wage, boosting worker-safety standards and prohibiting employers from retaliating or discriminating against workers who reported them for violating labor laws. The Mills campaign also pointed to a 2022 endorsement from the Maine AFL-CIO and a supportive statement from Monahan about a bill she vetoed in 2021.\n\n“Governor Mills’ record of fighting for workers’ rights, dignity, and pay has earned her praise from many unions throughout the state of Maine,” Tommy Garcia, a Mills spokesperson, said in a statement. “She has made clear she will continue fighting for working people in the Senate to lower costs, protect jobs, and improve our economy — and given she is the only candidate in this race who has negotiated and signed legislation that delivers real progress, Maine voters know she will continue to deliver for them.”\n\nThe Platner campaign declined to comment.\n\nMills has had some clashes with organized labor during her time as governor. In 2019 and 2021, she vetoed labor-backed measures aimed at strengthening the power of a third party’s rulings in disputes over public-sector workers’ wages, insurance and retirement. The measure remains a priority for the Maine AFL-CIO.\n\nIn her 2021 veto letter, Mills wrote the bill would delegate “the power of the purse to unelected officials, no matter how those individuals are selected.”\n\nSullivan described labor’s relationship with Mills as “adversarial.”\n\n“So Janet Mills is not somebody we will support,” he said. “And if, for some odd reason, she ends up going off some miracle win against Graham Platner, you’ll probably see a lot of unions supporting Collins.”\n\nThe UAW, which represents around 2,000 workers in Maine, endorsed Platner the day after Mills launched her campaign in October.\n\nFain said in an October statement announcing the endorsement that Platner is “focused on the real problems facing workers across this country — not the distractions the billionaire class uses to divide us. His campaign is rooted in the same core issues our union fights for every day: a living wage, affordable health care, retirement security, and time outside of work to actually live our lives.”\n\nPlatner also has endorsements from the Maine affiliate of National Nurses United and the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers.\n\nIn an interview, Monahan of the IBEW said he was drawn to Platner’s “impressive” backstory.\n\n“He’s an impressive person, kind of a [former Sen. Joe] Manchin, [Sen. John] Fetterman type, in that kind of category,” Monahan said, referring to Democrats from West Virginia and Pennsylvania who tacked to the center and frequently butted heads with the party’s base. “The numbers I keep seeing out of it, I mean, this isn’t just his polls. The guy’s kicking ass.”\n\nSchumer and the DSCC did not respond to requests for comment. They touted Mills as a strong recruit when she launched her campaign back in October. Mills told NBC News at the time that she met with Schumer once, several months before she launched her campaign, and that he encouraged her to run for the Senate.\n\nThe DSCC has since backed Mills’ candidacy, signing on to a joint fundraising committee with Mills’ campaign to help boost her fundraising. In a memo outlining “multiple paths” to the Senate majority released last month, the DSCC touted Mills and made no mention of Platner.\n\n“Janet Mills happens to have such a strong record, not only as the only Democrat who’s won in 20 years in Maine, but she has a record of fighting for Mainers, understanding their issues,” the DSCC’s chairwoman, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, told NBC News in January. “She stood up to President Trump, she sued him in court and won. So she uniquely, I think, has the grit and the chops to really take on Susan Collins and win. And so that’s why we are so supportive of Gov. Mills.”\n\nAsked whether the Maine Senate race would still be winnable if Platner is the nominee, Gillibrand said, “I’m confident we will have the best nominee, and I’m confident that we will win.”\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

A win dragged back from the brink.\n\nWill Jacks and Rehan Ahmed, two 20-somethings bursting with talent, arm in arm in the middle of the pitch as smiles beamed from the sidelines.\n\nIt was England how they used to be.\n\nJacks & Ahmed carry England to another thrilling win\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup semi-finals?\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nJacks and Ahmed were two of the first kids of Bazball.\n\nBoth made their Test debuts on the 2022 tour of Pakistan, when Ben Stokes' side were riding the crest of a wave.\n\nJacks took six wickets in his first match, Ahmed five as he became the youngest man to play Test cricket for England.\n\nThree and a half years on in Colombo, the same pair crashed England to a T20 World Cup win over New Zealand that gives them a similar feeling of momentum.\n\nBack then, Ahmed pipped Harry Brook to win a six-hitting contest among the Test squad in Pakistan and was England's first nighthawk during his debut in Karachi.\n\nHere he emerged to bat with England needing 43 runs from 19 balls and hit his second ball high over long-on for six to reignite a chase.\n\nJacks struck Glenn Phillips for a six of his own and followed with two fours, before Ahmed effectively sealed the deal by hitting Mitchell Santner over the rope at long-off.\n\nFrom staring at a momentum-busting defeat, England had a fifth successive win to take with them going forward.\n\n\"Baz actually sent one of the walkie talkie messages downstairs, saying 'tell Reh to bat like Sehwag',\" Ahmed explained - a reference to India's aggressive former opener Virender Sehwag.\n\nIt is a long time since it felt that simple. Those words could not be any more 2022.\n\nThe excitable spark Ahmed and Jacks provided has been lost by England at some point over recent months.\n\n\"Weak men\" in Australia. Noosa. A team's entire identity being pulled apart.\n\nSomething here at the World Cup feels more like a flashback to the times of old.\n\nMcCullum appears suited to helping build something with a talented, sometimes inspirational, captain. That is a place England have certainly been in before.\n\n\"This group is the era of Harry Brook as white-ball captain,\" Jacks said.\n\n\"He has got us to play a certain way and the environment around the group is absolutely brilliant.\n\n\"Hopefully everyone can see we are having fun and are approaching the game in the right way.\"\n\nThis was England's best win since the third Test against India last summer – the week of Jofra Archer's return in whites, Rishabh Pant's cartwheeling off stump, and Shoaib Bashir's charging towards the Lord's grandstand with a bandaged finger. How long ago does that feel?\n\nMost significantly, England are finding ways to win here after their winter of discontent – a hallmark of McCullum's first year in charge.\n\nIn those early days, they shipped 553 runs but still beat New Zealand in a whirlwind of Jonny Bairstow.\n\nThere was the chase of 378 against India, and the win on the flattest pitch Rawalpindi had ever seen.\n\nAt this World Cup, they have scrambled an escape against Nepal, scraped past Scotland and Italy when the walls threatened to crumble in, and beat Sri Lanka with one of the great one-man shows.\n\nIt is a welcome change for a side that squandered any chances they did create in Australia.\n\n\"If you can get yourself out of some tricky positions and end up winning games it does wonders for your confidence,\" Jacks said.\n\n\"There's no better team than one that fights and finds a way of winning.\"\n\nThis is not to say England have been perfect by any means – nor that everything that has come this winter is forgotten.\n\nThere remains no certainty that McCullum will be in charge come the summer, even after this run to the last four.\n\nThe Test victory in Hyderabad last year, which was followed by four heavy defeats, also shows one should never get too carried away.\n\nAnd Harry Brook's men now leave Sri Lanka - a country that has provided a sanctuary for over the past weeks and returned six T20 wins from six - for India and the semi-finals.\n\nThere they could meet the co-hosts or West Indies or South Africa - this tournament's three most-feared teams. There are only so many times you can go back to the well.\n\n\"Everyone knows about India and the storyline that brings,\" Jacks said.\n\n\"It could also be West Indies and they have beaten us in Mumbai.\n\n\"We know how tricky that will be. We will watching that game on Sunday. We will be prepared. We go in with optimism.\"\n\nIt is that optimism that has been drained over the recent months. For many it will, quite rightly, take months to come back.\n\nJacks, though, spoke with a glint in his eye – the look of a side starting to believe in themselves again - and dismissed concerns over the lack of straightforward wins.\n\n\"We've won six out of seven games and we've qualified for a semi-final,\" he said.\n\n\"At the end of the day, no-one really cares. We obviously want to play well in them but we're not gutted we haven't played a perfect game.\n\n\"What we've done well is the key moments - we've kept a calm and clear head and we've managed to get those rewards.\"\n\nFor now it is working. It is a welcome flash back to the good times.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Aston Villa boss Unai Emery concedes his Premier League title \"dreams\" are over, but will the club resurrect their Champions League hopes?",
    "fullText": "Unai Emery stormed down the tunnel at Molineux.\n\nRodrigo Gomes had just capped a woeful night for Aston Villa - the substitute finishing them off to earn Wolves a deserved victory.\n\nIt was enough for the head coach, who refused to wait for the final whistle and left Wolves boss Rob Edwards wondering where the post-match handshake was.\n\nA 2-0 defeat on Friday continued Villa's poor form - they have won just three of their past 10 Premier League games as they cling on to third in the Premier League.\n\nNow they face a crucial season-defining period, with their hopes of returning to the Champions League - and ending a 30-year trophy drought by winning the Europa League - very much in the balance.\n\nWolves dent Aston Villa's top five hopes to avoid unwanted points record\n\nIs England on course for fifth Champions League spot?\n\nChelsea and Manchester United are up next in the Premier League, the two teams immediately below Villa, and United will go third if they beat Crystal Palace on Sunday.\n\nThe chance to move six points clear of United, and nine ahead of Chelsea, was missed at the league's bottom side, who had just one previous win this season.\n\nA Europa League tie with Lille in the last 16 is also coming and a season which has promised so much could unravel quicky.\n\nEmery, though, defended his side and insisted even if their title hopes are done they are overachieving.\n\n\"We are losing the opportunity to win the title in the Premier League, two months ago we were competing with Arsenal and Manchester City, you were asking me about it,\" he said.\n\n\"Someone, even myself, may say 'maybe we can'. Some supporters, maybe they were dreaming it. Now we are not with the possibility to fight for the Premier League, some can feel frustrated, even myself because I have my dreams.\n\n\"In September I was worried and the objective was to stay in the Premier League. In December I was so happy and excited to get the top-five position and achieve the Champions League.\n\n\"One month ago I was dreaming about maybe winning the Premier League. Now we are in the average to be in the top five.\n\n\"Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United, they are trying to get to us, for them it is a priority to get into the Champions League.\"\n\nVilla are fortunate others have stumbled sooner and for longer this season - ensuring they have maintained a decent grip on third place until now.\n\nChelsea have dropped 17 points from winning positions at Stamford Bridge and 19 points overall in the Premier League this season.\n\nThey go to Arsenal on Sunday hoping to capitalise on Villa's latest slip - before travelling to Villa Park on Wednesday for a game which could define both teams' seasons.\n\nLille, in the Europa League on March 12, and a trip to Old Trafford on 15 March will then loom large for Villa.\n\nIndividual form has also plummeted, with Ollie Watkins scoring just once in 11 games - reminiscent of the spell where he scored only one goal in the opening 19 matches - while Morgan Rogers is on a similar streak.\n\nThe slump was sparked by injuries to Boubacar Kamara, John McGinn and Youri Tielemans last month as Villa's lack of depth was exposed.\n\nPlayers argued between themselves as Ezri Konsa - who also had a flashpoint with fans at the end - and Amadou Onana urged Emi Buendia to leave the pitch quicker as he was substituted.\n\nThe cracks are showing and even the players are admitting to feeling the pressure.\n\n\"It does weigh on us but it shouldn't,\" said Rogers. \"We deserve to be here and we should not forget that.\n\n\"Our run lately has not been as good as usual but that is the battle of the Premier League. We are going to get back to our good run of wins.\n\n\"We set our standards high and we have the ability to win every game. Obviously that is not realistic but we are playing good football as a whole and there is nothing to worry about.\n\n\"They [the next fixtures] are the games you want to play and, with so much on the line, we need to show why we deserve to be where we are.\"",

    "fullText": "Oleksandr Usyk will return to the ring in May when he defends his WBC heavyweight title against former kickboxing champion Rico Verhoeven at the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt.\n\nTwo-time undisputed heavyweight champion Usyk, who holds the WBA, WBC and IBF belts, has not fought since stopping Daniel Dubois at Wembley Stadium in July.\n\nIn a bout organisers have dubbed the 'Glory in Giza', 36-year-old Dutch heavyweight Verhoeven will be boxing for the first time since 2014 when he faces Usyk on 23 May.\n\n\"I truly respect people who reach the very top in their sport,\" said Usyk, who is unbeaten across his 24 professional bouts.\n\n\"Rico is one of them - a powerful athlete and a great champion.\n\n\"Being a champion isn't just about belts. It's about years of hard work, discipline and belief.\n\n\"I respect his journey - he's truly the King of Kickboxing. But this is boxing - a different game, with its own rules and its own kings.\n\nVerhoeven had 76 fights and 66 wins in his kickboxing career before announcing his departure from the sport in November.\n\n\"I spent 12 years as the undisputed heavyweight kickboxing champion and accomplished everything I set out to accomplish. But staying at the top for that long didn't take away the hunger, it strengthened it,\" said Verhoeven.\n\n\"I wasn't looking for comfort, so I started looking for the highest challenge available in another world.\n\n\"Usyk is undisputed in boxing. That's the kind of challenge that motivates me. Undisputed versus undisputed. The best facing the best.\"\n\nThis is a world heavyweight title fight in the shadow of one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World - a backdrop so spectacular it almost distracts from how extraordinary, and frankly bizarre, the contest itself is.\n\nDetails of the fight's location are light, other than that it will be \"under the shadow of ancient giants\".\n\nBut no matter the location, this will be a mammoth mismatch. And that is not said lightly during a time that has already given us Anthony Joshua v Jake Paul. At least that was framed as spectacle. This is for the WBC heavyweight title.\n\nVerhoeven had been loosely linked with a bout against Joshua before the Briton's car crash in December. But there is a vast difference between a crossover curiosity and a sanctioned world-title challenge against a pound-for-pound great.\n\nUsyk may be running out of credible dance partners, which perhaps explains it. But the heavyweight cupboard is not bare. He vacated his WBO title rather than face Fabio Wardley, while Agit Kabayel's name has been repeatedly mentioned by fans craving a live, unbeaten contender with momentum. Instead, we are handed a boxing novice.\n\nTyson Fury was dropped and pushed to the brink by boxing debutant Francis Ngannou in 2023, who came close to one of the biggest upsets in heavyweight history. So anything can happen in the ring, of course, but someone as methodical and disciplined as Usyk is unlikely to repeat Fury's errors.\n\nEven in this current era of boxing, where hype and profit can outweigh logic, this sits high on the \"how did we get here?\" list.\n\nUsyk targeting 2026 return but rules out Itauma\n\nWardley to be world champion as Usyk gives up belt\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",
