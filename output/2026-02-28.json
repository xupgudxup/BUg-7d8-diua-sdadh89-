    "description": "CEO JT Batson says the tournament is forcing brands to see the value of the sport’s fans.",
    "fullText": "The 2026 FIFA World Cup — jointly hosted by the US, Canada, and Mexico— represents a coming of age for the sport that most of the world calls football in the country that calls it soccer. JT Batson, CEO of US Soccer, hopes the kickoff to the tournament this June will also be a vindication of four years of work to modernize the group behind the US men’s and women’s national teams, and a moment for more brands to understand the spending power of their fans.\n\n“Having the World Cup here has been a bit of a forcing function to crisply articulate your soccer strategy as a brand,” he says. US Soccer counts two dozen commercial partners, from American Airlines and AT&T to Visa and Volkswagen, who Batson says have been drawn by the demographics of the sport’s large US fanbase. “It’s growing, it’s young, it’s diverse, and it’s tech savvy; those are all things you care about as a brand.”\n\nSurveys suggest the sport has the momentum to build that fan base further. A Harris Poll last year found the number of US soccer followers increased 17% between 2020 and 2025. Almost three-quarters of Americans now say they are interested in soccer, of whom 20% describe themselves as “obsessed.”\n\nUS Soccer’s own growth has exceeded that pace: Its revenues are up more than 300% since 2023, as it changed its commercial model to bring sponsorship, media, and marketing rights in-house. Batson has pulled in record philanthropic donations, including $50 million from Home Depot co-founder Arthur Blank for a new national training center in Atlanta, and $30 million from Washington Spirit owner Michele Kang for women’s and girls’ programs.\n\nAnother factor has helped the corporate interest, Batson adds: the fact that many large companies are run by executives who grew up watching the sport. “Generations ago, that was not the case.”\n\nBatson, an early employee of Mozilla who had played for Augusta Arsenal in Georgia before becoming a referee, came to his job after a chance encounter with US Soccer’s board chair on an Amtrak train. “I learned it was a nonprofit that didn’t do fundraising, so I went home and made a fundraising strategy,” he recalls. He joined as a volunteer before being made CEO in 2022. Here’s how he describes his game plan for the World Cup and the sport he now oversees.\n\nAndrew Edgecliffe-Johnson: US Soccer’s revenues have increased by more than 300% since 2023. What has it taken to do that?\n\nJT Batson: The biggest thing for us is embracing that we are a soccer nation. We’ve grown a tremendous amount since the 1994 women’s World Cup, and we set out a strategy last year of being “in service to soccer.” We asked ourselves, “If we stepped out of our role and were back to being a fan, what would we hope US Soccer would be doing?” There were three things we needed at the same time to unlock our potential: trust, the right strategy, and the right communication. If you’re missing any one of those three, this doesn’t work.\n\nWhat has driven the growth in corporate partnerships?\n\nFirst, the US soccer market is large, with well over 100 million fans. Second, the US men’s and women’s national teams are among the most popular teams in the country. And third, so many people in positions of responsibility in corporations are soccer people through and through. In a previous generation, maybe they’d have been football people or baseball people or basketball people. This generation deeply understands the sport and cares about it as a growth driver. A number of big brands have told us their No. 1 growth priority is soccer.\n\nWhat’s your strategy for using the World Cup to elevate soccer in the US?\n\nFirst, we’ve got to make sure that our team is in the best position to win. We’ve hired the best possible coaches for our team, and we’ve got a great player pool. We’re also very focused on making sure everyone in America can participate. So we’re making it super accessible to go into a Walmart or a CVS and buy US Soccer gear, and we’re supporting watch parties in hundreds of communities.\n\nWhat we want to hold ourselves accountable to is being in a position where soccer is the most-played sport in every community. We’ve announced initiatives around soccer in schools, aimed at ensuring anyone who wants to play soccer can play. We also focus on making sure kids are having fun. Very often there’s a professionalization of kids’ sports at too young an age. Of course we want to produce players who can win World Cups, but at its core, you want to train hard when you’re having fun.\n\nCritics including New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani are concerned that World Cup tickets will be unaffordable. Is the sport pricing fans out?\n\nAll sports are having to confront the fact there are way more people who want to be in the stands than there are seats. We’re very mindful of that, [so] for all our games, we’ll have a reserved set of tickets that are very affordable for our core fans. We’re looking at how we leverage technology to ensure our diehard fans are closest to the field.\n\nWith 27 national teams, you’re surrounded by coaches. What have you learned about leadership from them?\n\nI’ve asked them about the dynamics of managing a team and they ask me as many questions around managing a business. What we find is that there’s a lot in common. Probing an analogous space leads you to learn and stretch.\n\nWhat leads to success in soccer is very similar to what leads to success in business. A key thing is to remember that every market is unique. If you enter a new market and you do not become a student of that market and learn everything about it, the rules, it’s going to eat you up and spit you out. You can have the greatest [product], but if you can’t solve for the consumers in that market, you can waste a whole lot of time and money.\n\nWill soccer in the US one day have the global status that the Premier League, the Bundesliga, or Serie A do now?\n\nOur market is very big. It is growing, we now have infrastructure, and we have talent. You’ve also got a generation of Americans who’ve grown up when they’ve only known Major League Soccer to exist and it’s a core part of their media diet. Talent is a leading indicator of success in an organization, and the talent that’s choosing to go to MLS is getting better and better. Then you apply the great commercialization of sport in the US, and you’re onto something. The [team] owners in the US are the best in the world. Think about their resources and their sports business acumen. The Bundesliga or Serie A don’t have that. The ownership depth and breadth is a huge strategic advantage.\n\nUS Soccer held a summit in Washington, DC, in December that drew more than 400 partners and donors, highlighting the organization’s “financial glow-up” under Batson, Sports Business Journal reported.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTeam USA will have a loaded starting rotation at the 2026 World Baseball Classic.\n\nBut when Detroit Tigers ace Tarik Skubal announced he would make just one start before returning to his MLB club, many fans of the tournament expressed their disappointment and confusion.\n\nLikely the United States No. 2 starter in the rotation, Pittsburgh Pirates superstar Paul Skenes, will make two starts at the WBC. Other members of manager Mark DeRosa's rotation could include Matthew Boyd, Nolan McLean, Joe Ryan, and Logan Webb.\n\nThe question is, why so few starts for both Skubal and Skenes? Webb, the likely Opening Day starter for the San Francisco Giants, has an answer.\n\nWebb joined \"Foul Territory\" with former Major League catcher Erik Kratz on Friday to discuss the upcoming WBC. Webb confirmed he will make two starts in the international tournament, but wants to clear some things up ahead of time.\n\n\"I feel like I got slack for that, too,\" Webb told Kratz about him and Skenes making two starts and Skubal making one start at the WBC. \"I don't think they understand it's only seven games. If I throw two, Paul throws two, and Skubal throws one... those are studs throwing those other games.\"\n\n\"I don't think they understand it's only seven games.\"\n\nLogan Webb confirms he's starting two games in the World Baseball Classic and tries to clear up some confusion among fans when it comes to starts. pic.twitter.com/R3A5qyl4M1\n\n— Foul Territory (@FoulTerritoryTV) February 27, 2026\n\nThe United States will have a much deeper pitching staff this time around than in 2023.

    "fullText": "Troy Ryan is grateful and honored to have overseen the Canadian women’s hockey team at two Olympics and told The Associated Press on Friday that he believes it’s time he stepped down as coach.\n\nAsked if he foresees coaching the team at the world championships in November, Ryan said: “I don’t believe so. I would never say never, but very unlikely.”\n\nHe then added: “I think it’s time for someone else to run with it and take it to new heights.”\n\nRyan spoke by phone from Seattle, where his Toronto Sceptres return from the PWHL’s month-long Olympic break to play the Torrent. And Ryan spoke a day after first suggesting his tenure as coach was over during a video conference call with PWHL reporters.\n\n“I do believe to some extent that there is time for change, and this is probably the right time for change,” Ryan said. “I’ve had those conversations consistently over the years with Hockey Canada on when the right time to transition into either a different role or just completely transition out of the program.”\n\nRyan’s contract with Hockey Canada expires this year. He said further details need to be worked out, and he hoped to have a voice in the succession plan. Among the potential candidates to replace him are two of his assistants, Kori Cheverie and former Canadian Olympian Caroline Ouellette.\n\nThe 54-year-old Ryan prepares to leave his job following a 2-1 overtime loss to the United States in the gold-medal game at the Milan Cortina Olympics. It was an outing in which the Canadians pushed a younger, faster American team to a near upset before Hilary Knight tied the game with 2:04 remaining and Megan Keller sealed the win 4:07 into overtime.\n\nDespite the loss, Ryan earned credit for his six-year tenure that included a gold-medal win at the 2022 Beijing Games. He also coached Canada to win three world championship titles, along with two silvers.\n\nRyan will be best remembered for turning around a team that bottomed out by losing to host Finland in the semifinals at the 2019 world championships and settling for bronze. It marked the only time Canada had not reached the gold-medal round in world championship or Olympic play.\n\nThe Canadians dominated the Beijing tournament by winning all seven games in which they outscored their opponents by a combined 57-10, closing with a 3-2 gold-medal win over the U.S.\n\nRyan’s pending departure coincides with what is expected to be a large turnover of what was a veteran Canadian roster, led by 34-year-old captain Marie-Philip Poulin and featuring, forwards Natalie Spooner (35), Brianne Jenner (34) and defender Jocelyne Larocque (37).\n\nPoulin, aka “Captain Clutch,” said she has not yet determined her future.\n\nThe roster changeover factored into Ryan’s decision as he considered it an ideal time for a new coach to begin reshaping the team for the 2030 Olympics in France. He’d like to remain a part of the program in an advisory role to assist the new coach, but noted that will be up to Hockey Canada and his successor.\n\nAP Olympic coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "Forfeits by high school boys' soccer teams in the City Section and Southern Section playoffs continued on Friday as both sections try to deal with violations of CIF bylaw 600, which prohibits players from participating in outside leagues during their sports season.\n\nCalabasas pulled out of the Southern Section Division 3 boys soccer championship on Friday because of an ineligible player. Chavez became the sixth City Section school eliminated from the playoffs for using an ineligible player and was replaced by Chatsworth for the City Division I final.\n\nThere's also an allegation about another Southern Section team that could result in another forfeit in the final.\n\nSome high schools thought they had found a solution around the rule by not allowing players to play high school soccer until after their club seasons ended in early December. Cathedral had several players miss its first three games because there's several big club tournaments in November and early December.\n\n\"You communicate to students and parents,\" Cathedral coach Arturo Lopez said. \"Unfortunately, there's more and more academies now.\"\n\nRon Nocetti, the executive director of the CIF, said, \"I think we have to have conversations with our sections.\"\n\nSeveral times CIF membership has rejected getting rid of bylaw 600. Schools don't want to have their coaches battling it out weekly with club coaches, which also would place additional pressure on athletes dealing with school work and then having to do double workouts.\n\nThe balancing act for students is already tough enough with growing club teams in a lot of sports because it's a lucrative business. The CIF briefly suspended the rule during the pandemic in 2020 but quickly reinstated it.\n\nThe problem is club soccer programs are holding competitions in the middle of the high school season, and players, knowing the rule that you can't play high school and club at the same time, have apparently decided to try to do both with the hope of not getting caught.\n\nThis year, they are getting caught. Emails alleging violations started arriving to City Section commissioner Vicky Lagos before the semifinals. If a player is found to have played club, the high school team has to forfeit, and if it happens during the playoffs, the team is eliminated.\n\nUsually the pressure is on schools to make sure rules are not violated, but for bylaw 600, schools can do everything right and still be punished for a player violating the rule on their own.\n\nSeveral leagues are expected to present proposals to get rid of bylaw 600.\n\nNocetti said membership might be open to adopting changes.\n\n\"Maybe this is a tipping point for schools saying maybe it's time to make a big change with the rule,\" he said.\n\nA.

    "description": "Los Angeles Dodgers president of baseball operations named left-hander Justin Wrobleski as a candidate for the starting rotation in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers president of baseball operations named left-hander Justin Wrobleski as a candidate for the starting rotation in 2026.\n\nWrobleski, 25, has featured for the Dodgers 32 times over the last two regular season campaigns, eight of which came as starts. Through his two seasons with the Dodgers, Wrobleski has a 4.81 ERA and 102 strikeouts through 103 innings pitched.\n\nHe hit his stride towards the end of the 2025 season, keeping allowing a run in just two of his final eight appearances of the season. The southpaw continued to dominate into the postseason, not allowing a single run through four appearances — including two World Series games.\n\n“I think his ability to grow and mature and learn how to harness his stuff and compete in those moments will serve him well as he tries to navigate a lineup two, three times,” Friedman said, per MLB’s Sonja Chen. “He’ll certainly be a candidate. He was also so good out of the ‘pen, we have to weigh that.”\n\nWrobleski struggled as a starter last season, beginning just two games on the mound and allowing 12 earned runs through 11 innings. The Dodgers, though, may not have much of a choice.\n\nAs of now, the Dodgers’ rotation is completely open, at least to begin the season. Tyler Glasnow and Yoshinobu Yamamoto are sure to have a spot at the beginning of the season, but Blake Snell and Shohei Ohtani have big question marks hanging above them as far as pitching on Opening Day pitching is concerned.\n\nThe remaining spots have plenty of suitors, and the current frontrunners are Roki Sasaki, Emmet Sheehan, Gavin Stone and River Ryan. Both Stone and Ryan are coming back from season-long injuries, so if the Dodgers were to look at someone to fill the spot who can immediately undertake a full workload, it would make sense for them to look at Wrobleski as someone who has started games before.\n\nWrobleski has already made his spring training debut for 2026 and looked solid through the singular inning he pitched, notching a strikeout through a scoreless inning against the Cleveland Guardians.\n\nIf he can continue to produce results throughout the spring, the third-year left-hander could make a return to a starting spot in 2026.\n\nWould you want to see Justin Wrobleski start games this season?",

    "description": "The best goal scorer to ever wear the famous stripes for the Bianconere is heading to the United States for a little while.",
    "fullText": "Cristiana Girelli has accomplished just about everything you can as a women’s footballer in Italy. She has led the league in goals, she has won titles upon titles upon titles, with her trophy case at Brescia and then Juventus about as plentiful as one could potentially get over the last decade and a half.\n\nBut Girelli, Juve’s No. 10 and all-time leading scorer is heading for a new experience.\n\nFor the first time in her career, Girelli is going to be playing ball outside of Italy. You can extend that to outside of Europe, too. Just like former teammates Sofia Cantore and Lisa Boattin did a summer ago, Girelli is heading for the United States, joining Bay FC on loan until August, Juventus Women announced on Friday night. To make that happen, Girelli extended her contract with Juventus Women until 2027 — which means this isn’t fully goodbye just yet, but just more of a case of “See you soon!”\n\nJust as long as she doesn’t completely fall in love with the Bay Area and everything it has to offer. Same goes for playing on a stage like the NWSL is being one of the best and most competitive leagues in the world of women’s football.\n\nCristiana Girelli has renewed her contract, and is joining NWSL side Bay FC on loan ✍️\n\nGood luck, Cri! \n\n🗞️ https://t.co/UnMeQ2Oau2 pic.twitter.com/rpzJzUyWLG\n\n— JuventusFC 🇬🇧🇺🇸 (@juventusfcen) February 27, 2026\n\nHaving a playing experience outside of Italy is something that Girelli said she would like to see happen before her incredibly accomplished career comes to an end. And at 35 years old, she knows that those kinds of chances are only going to be possible for so much longer — which is why leaving a club (albeit likely just for a few months) that she has been at for nearly a decade is a decision she had to make.\n\nIt is something that clearly influenced the timing of this and for Girelli to jump at the chance to head to the NWSL and sign — albeit on a loan deal that will only be for about five or sixth months — with Bay FC, one of the league’s newest clubs.\n\nIt will be quite strange to see Girelli in another club’s jersey after so much time in the famous black and white stripes. She’s achieved so much in Turin between the multiple league titles and all the freakin’ goals that she’s scored. She’s the club’s all-time leader in goals scored. She’s the club’s all-time leader in appearances. She’s one of the best Italian players of this generation and a leading force in helping Juve and the Azzurre get to where they’ve gotten over the last decade.\n\nAs part of her farewell (for now), Girelli penned a letter to Juve supporters. It reads in full below:\n\nI wanted to speak to you directly because I felt the need to share my thoughts with you.\n\nIt was not an easy decision to make, quite the contrary…\n\nHowever, in football, we all know that time is limited.\n\nAn athlete’s career does not last forever and, at this point in my career, I know that certain opportunities may only come once.\n\nThis important opportunity suddenly presented itself to me, and I felt the need to test myself again, to have a different experience, before it was too late to do so.\n\nI understand that some people may not agree with the timing, but global football has different schedules and certain opportunities come when they come: either you take them at that moment, or you risk never experiencing them again.\n\nAnd that was the hardest part for me to accept.\n\nIt was a gut decision rather than a heartfelt one, because my heart only has two colours.\n\nThat’s why I don’t feel like this is goodbye.\n\nYou all know how much I love this team, you and this shirt, ever since I was a child, which I have loved every single day for the past eight years and will continue to love even from the other side of the world.\n\nThis club is my home, my family, the love of my life.\n\nAnd this experience takes nothing away from what Juventus means to me and the place it has and always will have in my heart.\n\nI know that not everyone will understand this decision, and I respect that, but I hope you will continue to support this team as you always have.\n\nI am certain that TOGETHER we can continue to fight until the end to achieve all of our goals for the season.\n\nForza Juve, Fino alla fine.\nALWAYS.\n\nGirelli’s new squad, Bay FC, opens the 2026 NWSL season on March 14 against expansion club Denver Summit FC. If she is to play in that game like many expect her to in some shape or form, she will be looking to score on former Juve teammate Pauline Peyraud-Magnin, who left Juve at the end of January and signed with Denver Summit FC a couple of weeks later.",

    "description": "A few NFL experts would be fans of the Rams trading for Colts QB Anthony Richardson.",
    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Rams aren't in the market for a new quarterback yet, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't do a little window shopping. Matthew Stafford will be back for another season in 2026, but his future beyond next season is cloudy at best.\n\nWhile L.A. could find its future franchise quarterback in the 2026 draft, there is another avenue they could go down: The trade market. While many names have been touted, two analysts from NFL.com think Anthony Richardson should be a great fit for the Rams.\n\nMarc Ross and Maurice Jones-Drew both pick L.A. as \"ideal landing spots\" for Richardson, who recently requested a trade from the Colts after his third season.\n\nRoss thinks Richardson would be able to learn a lot under Stafford and could turn build his stock back up with Sean McVay as his head coach.\n\n\"Richardson's situation is a Catch-22. He has so little playing experience that he needs to get on the field in order to develop, yet he still is not ready to play at a consistent enough level to produce wins as a starter,\" Ross wrote. \"Thus, a role with the Rams would be an ideal landing spot. He would learn behind reigning MVP Matthew Stafford in the Sean McVay offense, and the only other QB on the current roster is Stetson Bennett, who was drafted 124 spots behind Richardson in the 2023 draft. The hope would be for Richardson to emerge much like this offseason's top quarterback in the free agency market, Malik Willis, who saw drastic improvements under Matt LaFleur (the same offense McVay runs in L.A.).\"\n\nJones-Drew agreed, pointing to other McVay-like coaches who helped reclaim other first-round busts.\n\n\"Sam Darnold went from former first-round bust to Super Bowl champion, and a huge player in that career turnaround was learning from coaches Kyle Shanahan and Kevin O'Connell during stops in San Francisco and Minnesota, respectively,\" Jones-Drew wrote. \"Richardson could be the NFL's next reclamation project if he lands in the right spot after his tumultuous stint in Indy. Learning under Shanahan or Sean McVay in Los Angeles could help Richardson turn his career around and potentially earn another chance to eventually start.\"\n\nRoss and MJD aren't the only analysts who think the Rams are a good fit for Richardson. Robert Griffin III is also a fan of this move. Griffin III called a trade to L.A. \"his Sam Darnold reset year.\"\n\nThere are clear pros and cons to trading for Richardson, and it's unclear if the Rams are even interested in pulling off this move. But, at least in the media, some favor the decision. It would also be a stepping stone to a potential post-Stafford future, unless the Rams have other plans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rams Wire: Rams named as a best fit for Anthony Richardson by 2 analysts",

    "fullText": "WWE Elimination Chamber 2026 is right around the corner, and whether he wins the men's Chamber match and moves on to face Drew McIntyre at WrestleMania 42, this Saturday will be a landmark show for Randy Orton. \"The Viper\" will be wrestling in his tenth Elimination Chamber match, making him the first WWE Superstar double digits for appearances in the match and extending his own record of most appearances in the match in WWE history. Orton was asked about what the milestone means to him during a recent appearance on ESPN's \"Get Up\" and just like the other nine bouts, Orton has one thing on his mind, winning.\n\n\"Ten Elimination Chambers is a lot of Elimination Chambers,\" Orton said. \"My body's been beat up all over that ring and that chamber man. It is unforgiving, but I take a lot of experience with myself into that chamber and I'm going to use it this Saturday, and I'm going to win the thing, and go to WrestleMania man. I've only got so many more years that I'm going to be able to do this, and I'm enjoying every second of it. So at the Chamber, I make it count.\"\n\nDespite Orton's record for most appearances in the Elimination Chamber, he has only ever won one of them. That win came back in 2014 when Orton was part of The Authority, but despite that victory being 12 years ago, Orton is ready to grab his second win this Saturday. \"I was the bad guy man. I came out last in the pod, Daniel Bryan was the fan favorite, I ended up winning and going on to main event WrestleMania. That was a huge win for me and I plan on doing it all again this Saturday.\"\n\nPlease credit ESPN when using quotes from this article, and give a H/T to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "Good thing these losses don’t matter",
    "fullText": "The A’s can’t seem to get many wins this spring but luckily these games don’t count just yet. Still would be nice to see another win sometime soon as the Athletics dropped another game on Friday afternoon, losing to the Royals 7-6 and dropping their meaningless record to 1-5.\n\nThe A’s jumped out to an early lead this afternoon. A pair of walks put two runners on for Max Muncy. Looking to put some distance between himself and Darell Hernaiz for the starting third base job, Muncy took a fastball down the middle and drove it into center field for a double and bringing in both runs, giving the A’s the first lead.\n\nLeft-hander Jeffrey Springs got his first action today, taking the ball to start against KC today. While the stats don’t matter today still wasn’t a great first outing for the 33-year-old considering his early-game struggles last year. Springs had an easy first inning but got hit hard in the second, allowing four runs to score capped by a Bobby Witt Jr. three-run home run that wiped away the A’s early lead. That would chase him from this game after getting up to 39 pitches, which is probably around where the coaching staff wanted him as they slowly ramp the veteran lefty up for the long season ahead.\n\nThe A’s got one of those runs back in the next frame thanks to a Carlos Cortes double and a pair of productive groundouts to bring him in. Then the A’s got the big hit they were looking for in the fourth. Shortstop Jacob Wilson came to the plate with a runner on first and blasted a 429-foot home run to left field, his first long ball of spring and one that tied this game up a 5 apiece. The A’s would then take the lead the very next inning, courtesy of Muncy’s first home run of the spring.\n\nThe Royals would battle back late however. Lefty Brady Basso began the seventh and didn’t have his best stuff today. A double and a pair of walks loaded the bases and while he was just one strike away from getting out of the jam, a two-run double bit him and gave KC back the lead.\n\nThe A’s put together a scoring threat in the eighth thanks to a couple hits from some prospects (including Leo De Vries!), but couldn’t manage to knot this game up, falling 7-6 to finish the afternoon off.\n\nNot great but the offense has really picked it up after a slow start to spring. We do this all again tomorrow, with the San Francisco Giants coming to Hohokam Stadium for another afternoon matchup with our A’s. Right-hander Luis Morales is set to get the ball for his second appearance this spring. He allowed a run on a couple hits in a couple innings of work earlier this week but will be getting his first starting nod. The Giants will go with veteran righty Tyler Mahle for his first appearance of camp. Hopefully the A’s can get another one of those currently-meaningless wins.\n\nMuncy finished the day 2-for-3 with three RBI’s. It’s a super small sample but he’s 4-for-10 so far with one walk and one strikeout.\n\nHernaiz isn’t making the coaching staff’s job easy though. He went 0-for-1 today but also drew a pair of walks. He’s 5-for-11 this spring. Does a big showing in the upcoming WBC do him any favors with the coaching staff?\n\nJamie Arnold sighting! The A’s most recent first-round pick made it into his first game action for the A’s. He pitched a scoreless inning, allowing a hit and a walk while also collecting two punchouts. A nice little spring debut for the left-hander.\n\nCenter fielder Denzel Clarke has had a rough go of it at the plate to start camp, but he finally collected his first hit this spring today. He doesn’t need to do much offensively to have value for the A’s this coming season but he also can’t be a complete black hole in the lineup.\n\nTop prospect Leo De Vries went 2-for-2 today, a positive showing for the young shortstop who is nearly in the big leagues. He won’t be breaking camp with the club but a strong showing in front of the coaches during camp doesn’t hurt.\n\nRighty reliever Elvis Alvarado had a second scoreless appearance this afternoon, while fellow relief pitcher Michael Kelly gave up a run in his inning of work. These two could be closer options for Mark Kotsay this coming year.",

    "description": "Upamecano has introduced Karl to the school of hard knocks.",
    "fullText": "The jump from youth football to professional football is always a very difficult one. Despite his successes for Bayern Munich during the 2025/26 season to date, the same is true for Lennart Karl. Lest we forget, his only minutes in professional football before this season were his 45 minutes in the Club World Cup. He has made the transition look easy with many, many phenomenal performances this season.\n\nBut Karl is still a slight, 5’5″ player. Asked by Kicker what the biggest adjustment going from youth to pro football has been, there was only going to be one answer:\n\n“The biggest differences are clearly the physicality and intensity; the training is much more strenuous than in youth football,” Karl said, as captured by @iMiaSanMia. “I can’t compare dribbling against a 17-year-old to dribbling against [Bayern teammate] Dayot Upamecano.”\n\nUpamecano has been mentioned several times by other Bayern players as a fearsome opponent to dribble against. The French center back is a very tough competitor and extremely tough to overcome in a footballing duel. But when Karl’s dribbles do come off against him, how does Upamecano react?\n\n“If something like that happens, I do get a reaction, but we joke about it again in the dressing room. Then it’s all good.”\n\nPart of being a professional footballer is being treated like one. Despite only recently turning 18, Karl is being treated like a fully grown adult by teammates a decade older than him, as Upamecano is. Perhaps that is another big difference between youth and professional football.",

    "description": "Tutu Atwell will probably be better for his next team than he was with Rams",
    "fullText": "I warned earlier this month that Tutu Atwell could easily be better for his next team than he was with the Los Angeles Rams:\n\nOne of the most disappointing outcomes of the 2025 season for the Los Angeles Rams was Tutu Atwell’s disappearing act. Atwell signed a one-year, $10M deal last offseason to return to LA after the expiration of his rookie contract. The receiver finished with six catches for 192 yards and a touchdown. The Rams effectively paid him $1.67M per reception or $52,000 per yard depending on how you want to look at it…\n\nAtwell is a good receiver. He’s performed well and has been productive when given opportunity, whether intentional or in a pinch because of injuries to others. Atwell plays bigger than his slight size and is one of the fastest players on the field when he steps between the white lines.\n\nWhile the Rams weren’t able to put his abilities towards their best use, I wouldn’t be shocked if another team can maximize his potential.\n\nWith the idea that Atwell could be a difference maker elsewhere in 2026 in mind, let’s turn our eye toward potential landing spots. Which teams would Rams fans not want to see sign Atwell?\n\nBuffalo made a significant stylistic change in their receiver corps from the early stages of Josh Allen’s breakout to today. Allen first made a major jump in his career trajectory when he was throwing to the likes of Stefon Diggs, Cole Beasley, John Brown, Gabe Davis, and Emmanuel Sanders. These players are mostly slight of frame aside from Davis.\n\nFast forward to 2025 and the Bills possibly overloaded on large targets in Keon Coleman, Joshua Palmer, Dawson Knox, and Dalton Kincaid. The result in terms of offensive production went the wrong direction.\n\nPerhaps Buffalo intends to return to the approach that worked best for them in the past. Atwell could work as a lethal deep threat that is also feisty for his size over the middle. He’s a natural separator that would add an element to the Bills’ offense they simply don’t have now.\n\nAtwell is not Tyreek Hill. While they are both fast players, Hill is a much better change of direction player.\n\nBut the Chiefs have attempted to replace Hill time and time again. They need a reliable deep threat in their offense and Atwell would probably work. Tyquan Thornton separated in the deep area of the field often but never seemed to be on the same page as Patrick Mahomes.\n\nCould Atwell patch this hole for the Chiefs in 2026?\n\nTyler Shough did enough to return as New Orleans’ start in 2026, but the Saints passing game never felt lethal last offseason. Shough is a fine short area passer. He needs to threaten vertically more often in order to take his game to the next level.\n\nAtwell is an interesting compliment to Chris Olave. The Saints are also in position to draft one of the top receiver prospects in Jordyn Tyson or Carnell Tate who would give them more of a size element. Atwell would be an interesting third option in their passing game.\n\nAtwell won’t break the bank in free agency. All three of these teams are cash-strapped and he makes sense as a target.",

    "fullText": "Predators star Steven Stamkos isn't ready to leave Nashville.\n\nStamkos denied a report from The Athletic's Pierre LeBrun that he might be willing to waive a full no-movement clause in his contract to be traded to a legitimate contender.\n\n\"I haven't talked to (general manager Barry Trotz) at all about that,\" Stamkos said, adding there was \"zero\" chance he'd be willing to waive his no movement clause.\n\n\"Obviously there's stuff that gets reported,\" Stamkos said. \"But what I'll say, with this group, we want to be together. I can only control what I can control, but I love being here.\"\n\nStamkos, 36, has drawn attention ahead of the March 6 NHL trade deadline.\n\nIn The Athletic's Feb. 26 report, the Tampa Bay Lightning, Dallas Stars and Minnesota Wild were mentioned as potential trade partners.\n\nThe Predators (27-24-7, 61 points) are coming off a 4-2 win over the Blackhawks that puts them within two points of the final wild card spot in the Western Conference. But even if Nashville makes the playoffs, they'd face a tough task going up against teams like Colorado, Vegas, Dallas or Minnesota in the first round.\n\nThat's fueled speculation that Trotz, who announced his retirement on Feb. 2, might be willing to sell off players like Stamkos to improve the team's future.\n\nAt least for himself, Stamkos doesn't see that happening.\n\n\"We want to play in meaningful hockey games and we're playing in meaningful hockey games right now,\" Stamkos said.\n\nThis season, Stamkos leads the Predators with 29 goals in 58 games, giving him 56 goals in two seasons with Nashville. The four-year contract he signed in 2024 includes an annual $8 million cap hit and runs through the 2027-28 season.\n\nPrior to his arrival in Nashville, Stamkos spent 16 seasons with Tampa Bay after being selected No. 1 overall in the 2008 NHL Draft. On Dec. 31, Stamkos scored his 600th NHL goal, becoming the 22nd player in NHL history to pass the milestone.\n\nROOKIE CONFIDENCE: Why Matthew Wood’s tying goal was 'biggest of the game' for Predators\n\nAlex Daugherty is the Predators beat writer for The Tennessean.

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Dodgers signed right-handed relief pitcher Keynan Middleton to a minor league deal Friday.\n\nMiddleton last pitched in MLB for the New York Yankees in 2023, spending 2024 sidelined with injury in the St. Louis Cardinals’ organization and 2025 in an independent league. The right-hander has historically had issues with injury, missing most of 2018 and 2019 after undergoing Tommy John surgery, but has managed some solid numbers when healthy.\n\nHis first MLB season came with the Los Angeles Angels in 2017, where he made 64 appearances and had a 3.86 ERA on the season. Despite his limited number of appearances across 2018 and 2019, he had a 1.78 ERA through 26 games.\n\nMiddleton began to decline in the 2020 season, though, posting three consecutive seasons where he hovered around a 5.00 ERA. He made a little bit of a comeback in his last MLB season in 2023, posting a 1.88 ERA with the Yankees in 12 games.\n\nThe Dodgers made a point to establish some depth in their bullpen this offseason, and this is exactly the kind of move which could make a difference. If Middleton can rediscover the form he had prior to his injuries towards the end of the 2010s, the Dodgers will have another stellar arm to use in a reinforced bullpen in the coming season.\n\nThe post Dodgers Sign Former Angels Reliever to Minor League Deal appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

Orton, meanwhile, is at +275 to win the match, while LA Knight is the darkhorse candidate at 4/1.\n\nOn the women's side, Rhea Ripley (-300) and Tiffany Stratton (-250) are expected to be the final two in the Elimination Chamber. Ripley (-150) is expected to get the victory and a shot at the WWE Women's Championship, currently held by Jade Cargill. But unlike the men's side, oddsmakers have the women's side a lot tighter, with Stratton at +110 to win.\n\nThe other two matches on the card have seen no movement betting wise since the line's original opening. As a result, CM Punk (-5000) is heavily favored to defeat Finn Balor (+1200) and retain his World Heavyweight Championship, while AJ Lee (-300) is expected to defeat Becky Lynch (+200) and become the new WWE women's intercontinental champion.\n\nLee will be competing in her first championship match in more than 11 years.

    "description": "CHENNAI: Shortly after his valiant unbeaten 97 against India in a losing cause on Thursday, Zimbabwe’s top batter Brian Bennett had to calmly introduce himself -- “I’m Bennett” at the post-match press conference.  It was an oversight by a journalist who failed to recognise Zimbabwe’s top batter, but he can’t be blamed completely.  Bennett has racked up 277 runs at a strike rate of 135.78, dismissed just once in five outings, and currently sits second on the tournament’s batting charts.",
    "fullText": "The opener has largely flown under the radar despite his phenomenal debut World Cup run. Bennett has racked up 277 runs at a strike rate of 135.78, dismissed just once in five outings, and currently sits second on the tournament’s batting charts.\n\nIn modern T20 cricket, where traditional anchors are increasingly rare, Bennett has quietly been playing the role for Zimbabwe with all the calm and cricketing brains it demands. Yet the 22-year-old begs to differ with the ‘anchor’ label.\n\n“I wouldn’t say it’s too much of an anchor role. I just try to do the simple things better ... to give Zimbabwe a good start in the Power Play and then sort of just carry on that momentum throughout the middle periods with the likes of (Sikandar) Raza, the guys who can hit the big sixes and stuff. I think I do go out there and try to play positive cricket and try to get at those higher strike rates. Sri Lanka was a bit different where the pitches weren't as good as they are here. So maybe that lower strike rate came into play.”\n\nHe doesn’t have the flash and flair of a power hitter, but that doesn’t mean he is any less effective.\n\n“I don’t really do much power hitting. I think for me, as more of a stroke player, I try to get into good positions ... If I’m in a strong position and I can get my hands to the ball, I get the best chance to hit those sixes,” said Bennett.\n\nEarlier on Thursday at Chepauk, he exactly demonstrated the value of timing and positioning when he muscled the world’s leading T20 bowler, Jasprit Bumrah over long-on to celebrate his third half-century in the tournament in an emphatic fashion. A shot that left everyone in awe.\n\n“I think Jasprit is always going to be a tough one to face. My thought process was just watch the ball as close as I can and just let my body do the actions. The ball was in my zone and I just hit it,” Bennett said.\n\nBennett also showcased an array of eye-catching strokes, including a clever scoop, against India’s decorated bowlers. “You practise those shots in the nets leading up to tournaments like this and the field normally tells you where the bowler is going to bowl. So the scoop was for pace-on yorkers. I thought that’s a good option with fine leg and third man up. Yeah, and it’s just literally keeping that clear mind,” said Bennett.\n\nZimbabwe’s breakthrough Super Eight will be remembered for many reasons, but above all, remember the name -- Brian Bennett.",

    "description": "Which corners can separate themselves at the NFL Combine?",
    "fullText": "NFL Combine winners and losers: Live updates on defensive backs, tight ends in Indianapolis originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe only bad news from Day 1 of NFL Combine drills is that Ohio State Buckeyes linebacker Sonny Styles isn't working out for the rest of the weekend. He stole the show on Thursday, setting an exceptionally high bar for the rest of the participants in Indianapolis.\n\nDay 2 of Combine drills will hope to separate the best defensive backs and tight ends from the pack. This class of defensive backs is defined by its biggest stars. Ohio State safety Caleb Downs is a sure-fire first-round pick, but several top cornerbacks sitting out of Friday's drills open the door for movement in the top 50.\n\nThe tight end position is more fluid. Oregon star Kenyon Sadiq is the runaway TE1. While the position is deep, it is far from settled, and strong testing numbers could push under-the-radar names up the board.\n\nWe'll track those winners and losers live as they run, jump, and drill their way to April.\n\nWinner: D'Angelo Ponds, CB, Indiana\n\nI was ready to write Ponds off as a loser, having measured in at the extremely small 5085 and 182 pounds. It's an outlier in the wrong direction, but I don't want to double-count it. Everyone knew he was among the shortest players in this class.\n\nIndiana CB D'Angelo Ponds just jumped a 43.50\" vertical😳pic.twitter.com/jO08foXmJV\n\n— PFF College (@PFF_College) February 27, 2026\n\nWhat we didn't know was that he was going to hit 43.5 inches in the vertical jump, the sixth-best mark from a corner since 1999, per MockDraftable's database. That kind of explosion is necessary to buy breathing room, adding margin for error that his frame steals from him. He needs to move exceptionally well to keep his stock in the right spot -- jumping out of the building is an exceptional way to start.\n\nWinner: Tacario Davis, CB, Washington\n\nFrequently, prototypical Cover 3 corners use their length to mitigate speed concerns. They might not have the quickest feet, but size can keep receivers at bay, too.\n\nDavis checked off both boxes, exceeding many expectations. At 6037, he's a pterodactyl, and the rest of his frame falls in line. A 97th-percentile wingspan and 95th-percentile arm length will have position coaches tripping over themselves until April.\n\nHe also ran well, posting an unofficial 4.41-second 40-yard dash. That's an excellent time for anyone, much less one who has some coverage questions to answer at the next level. If nothing else, his physical tools will boost his stock.\n\nIt's not a winner and losers column without the latter, but that isn't fair to TJ Hall. He wasn't expected to run his way up boards on the Indianapolis fast track. He did, however, run slower than every other corner at the event.\n\nWithout overwhelming size, Hall's lack of speed makes him a zone corner with mid-Day 3 aspirations. Fortunately, he moved well during the first batch of position drills -- he's not in free fall.\n\nWinner: Toriano Pride Jr., CB, Missouri\n\nThe other side of that coin, of course, is the fastest player at one's position. Pride put himself on the map with two blazing runs, the best of which came in at 4.32 seconds.\n\nMORE: NFL Combine 40-yard dash tracker\n\nPride is undersized at 5'10\", 185, but he isn't an outlier in terms of length. He showed off his burst during position drills, too. Speed of Pride's ilk doesn't hide, but showing out on this kind of stage is nice ammo in his argument to be a Day 3 pick.\n\nLoser: Emmanuel McNeil-Warren, SAF, Toledo\n\nA surprising underperformer on Friday was Emmanuel McNeil-Warren, who spent much of the process as a Day 2 pick before the recent wind of first-round rumors spread. Since the Super Bowl, the bar has been set for McNeil-Warren's Combine performance -- Seattle Seahawks rookie Nick Emmanwori.\n\nMcNeil-Warren, at 6034, 201, is slimmer than Emmanwori. His arms are slightly smaller, and his testing numbers look like they are going to fall pretty far behind. Seattle's star posted a 98th-percentile vertical jump and 99th-percentile broad jump. The Toledo safety had marks of 35.5 inches and 10'2\", far more pedestrian. In fact, 11 safeties had better vertical jumps in Indianapolis.\n\nHis first 40-yard dash clocked in at 4.55, albeit with what looked like a slow start. The sequel wasn't much better -- 4.53 seconds. Perhaps the Emmanwori hype was unfair, but this was a letdown, and it might push him back into Day 2.\n\nWinner: Lorenzo Styles Jr., SAF, Ohio State\n\nOhio State is taking over the NFL Combine. Thursday, Sonny Styles and Arvell Reese were headliners. On Friday, the other Styles brother was even faster, laying claim to the fastest man at the 2026 NFL Combine (at least for now).\n\nTwo 4.28-second runs are a \"call the family\" performance. Styles made himself money on the fast track and had the football world waiting on his second run. He delivered!\n\nWinner: Genesis Smith, SAF, Arizona\n\nThere's an argument to be made that no safety moved better than Smith on Friday. One of the class's only true free safeties, he showed the kind of dynamism necessary to take on that role at the next level.\n\nSmith had the best vertical jump (42.5 inches) of the group, the eighth-best mark for a safety since 1999. He's explosiveness personified, and it showed in his position drills, too. He was smooth, twitchy, and fast, making little of his 40-yard dash absence.\n\nSmith is a Day 2 centerfielder, a point he proved at the Combine.\n\nWinner: Dillon Thieneman, SAF, Oregon\n\nThere weren't any questions about whether Thieneman was fast heading into the Combine. The Oregon standout has plenty of explosiveness in his game, giving him range as a centerfielder and the burst to click-and-close underneath.\n\nThere's a difference between running a 4.45 40-yard dash and a 4.35 40-yard dash, though. His 41-inch vertical jump was the second-best mark among safeties. The 10'5\" broad jump was less imposing, but there was enough to hang his hat on for a positive day. Throw in position drills that saw Thieneman show off fluidity and footwork, and there was certainly a lot to like.\n\nIt wouldn't be all that surprising if Thieneman's testing puts him further into the Round 1 conversation, especially if others lose ground.\n\nWinner: Eli Stowers, TE, Vanderbilt\n\nWe have history in Indianapolis. No tight end in the history of the MockDraftable database (since 1999) has cleared 43.5 inches. Oregon's Kenyon Sadiq hit that mark. Moments later, Stowers beat it. By two full inches.\n\nWith a 45.5-inch vertical, it might not matter what Stowers runs. That short-area explosiveness defines his game and makes him one of the twitchiest athletes in his class. He's slot-bound, sure, but we learned with Evan Engram that being a tight end in name only is still a path to production in the NFL.\n\nIn the race for TE2, Stowers just took a massive leap.\n\nOh, and he also set the Combine record for a tight end broad jump (11'3\") before posting a 4.51-second 40-yard dash. Nice day at the office!\n\nSonny Styles scouting report: Ohio State LB could test into top five\n\nNFL Combine winners and losers from Day 1\n\nFive measurements to look forward to at the NFL Combine\n\nWhy is Jordyn Tyson skipping NFL Combine workouts?",

    "description": "OpenAI's record new funding round is all about fighting Google's dominance in AI. Elon Musk knew the threat back in 2015.",
    "fullText": "When Elon Musk committed big money to start OpenAI in late 2015, he wanted to create another AI company to stop Google from dominating this important field.\n\nWhile a lot has changed since then, the reason OpenAI exists still holds: Google has been working toward this AI moment for over 25 years, and it's the beast to beat.\n\nTake a look at the companies backing OpenAI, which raised a record $110 billion on Friday.\n\nOpenAI's largest corporate investors are fierce Google rivals that will benefit greatly if OpenAI manages to seriously challenge Google in the battle for AI supremacy and control over how digital information flows in this new era.\n\nIt's become \"everyone else against Google,\" in my view. Here's the breakdown:\n\nThe new big kahuna. Amazon is investing $50 billion in OpenAI.\n\nAmazon competes with Google in cloud computing. AI workloads have become the big new growth engine for this sector, and Google has been growing quickly.\n\nAmazon also rivals Google in product search, one of the most valuable parts of the online search business. Google has woven AI throughout its search offering, and Amazon is behind in this area.\n\nGoogle has been designing AI chips called TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) for about a decade. Amazon has a similar offering called Trainium—another huge area of competition.\n\nAmazon's $50 billion investment in OpenAI gets it several goodies that can help it fight Google.\n\nAmazon Web Services will serve as the exclusive third-party cloud distributor for OpenAI's Frontier business product, while jointly developing custom AI models for Amazon's applications.\n\nOpenAI will also use significant Trainium compute capacity to support advanced AI workloads and expand business access to its models via AWS's cloud infrastructure.\n\nNvidia agreed to invest $30 billion in OpenAI in this latest round.\n\nNvidia is the clear leader in AI chips, with its GPUs. However, Google TPUs have gained ground recently, with many of Nvidia's biggest customers also agreeing to either rent or buy TPUs. This could eat into Nvidia's market share and might slow its growth, if TPUs really catch on.\n\nFor its new investment, Nvidia also gets new goodies to help it fend off the Google threat.\n\nOpenAI is deepening its partnership with Nvidia by using massive new computing capacity to better train and run its most advanced AI models.\n\nThe new deal specifically centers on Nvidia's upcoming Vera Rubin systems and significantly increases the computing power available to run OpenAI models after they are trained. This is known as inference, and it's becoming the most important part of the AI chip wars.\n\nAlthough Microsoft didn't invest in the latest round, it has been OpenAI's biggest investor for years. Even after skipping this round, Microsoft likely owns more than 20% of OpenAI already and has a massive cloud-computing deal with the startup.\n\nMicrosoft is Google's original arch-enemy. Microsoft dominated the tech world before Google rose up in the early 2000s and took the web by storm.\n\nThese days, Microsoft competes with Google in almost everything it does, including cloud computing, business software, and search. (Bing lags far behind Google in search market share, though it still makes good money for Microsoft.)\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella is still trying to make Google dance, and OpenAI is key to this.\n\nWith Friday's new OpenAI funding round, Microsoft's existing deal with OpenAI won't change, including how they share revenue, handle intellectual property, define advanced AI, and Microsoft's exclusive rights to provide certain services.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "I've lived in Scotland my whole life. These are my 4 favorite day trips from Edinburgh.",
    "description": "I've lived in Scotland my whole life. Many visitors stay in Edinburgh, but there are lots of easy day trips nearby, like to Stirling and St Andrews.",
    "fullText": "As someone who's lived in central Scotland all her life, I've noticed that tourists often base themselves in Edinburgh — for good reason.\n\nThe capital city offers a brilliant slice of Scotland, with plenty of historic sites, interesting museums, and scenic vistas.\n\nNo country is just its capital, though, and there's plenty to explore beyond Edinburgh itself. I've taken full advantage of the country's well-connected train system by going on countless last-minute day trips to historic hubs and quaint towns.\n\nStirling, Glasgow, Dundee, and St Andrews are my four favorite places to visit from the Scottish capital, and they're all easily accessible by bus and train.\n\nStirling is about an hour's train ride from Edinburgh, with a round-trip ticket costing £12. Although it's less of a tourist hot spot, I actually think it has a better castle.\n\nBoth fortresses are scenically perched on a hill, but Stirling Castle is less crowded and includes a guided tour in the ticket price. I also find the interior much more interesting.\n\nAnother historic site worth exploring in Stirling is the Old Town Jail, which is about a 10-minute walk from the castle. The \"performance tours,\" featuring actors dressed in period-appropriate outfits, really bring the darkly fascinating history of the Victorian jail to life.\n\nAlso within walking distance of Stirling Castle is the Settle Inn, Stirling's oldest alehouse. Dating back to the 1730s, it's the perfect place to experience Scottish pub culture, offering a friendly and cozy atmosphere in which to enjoy a whisky.\n\nI also love visiting The Wallace Monument, which is a short bus ride from Stirling's center. The towering Gothic monument is full of history about William Wallace — Scotland's freedom-fighting hero.\n\nThere's a 246-step climb up a spiral staircase to reach the top, but the panoramic view is worth the effort.\n\nGlasgow is Edinburgh's friendly rival, and although they're only an hour apart by train, they feel completely different. Edinburgh is traditional and tartan-trimmed, whereas Glasgow is contemporary and quirky. A round-trip ticket from Edinburgh costs £16.80.\n\nI recommend walking the mural trail, which is a route highlighting Glasgow's street art. The pieces are wonderfully eclectic, and even if you don't do the full trail, you'll likely pass a few while wandering the city.\n\nGlasgow also has many museums, including Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum and the Tenement House, which is a time capsule of an early 20th-century Glaswegian home.\n\nFor a more unusual option, head to the Sharmanka Kinetic Theatre, which is an art museum full of mechanical figures that perform kinetic shows a few times throughout the day.\n\nAnd look out for the Duke of Wellington statue outside the Gallery of Modern Art. In comedic Scottish fashion, locals often accessorize the Duke by placing orange traffic cones on his head.\n\nDundee is less than an hour and a half away from Edinburgh by train.\n\nAlthough it didn't always have much to offer tourists in the way of museums and attractions, that's changed over the past decade.\n\nJust minutes from the train station is the V&A Museum, which opened in 2018. The striking building holds a permanent Scottish design gallery, alongside ever-changing exhibitions — I once visited a fascinating one on the history of tartan.\n\nMy favorite Dundee attraction is the RRS Discovery, the ship that first took Robert Falcon Scott to Antarctica in 1901. The Discovery was built in Dundee and is now docked right next to the V&A. There's an interesting exhibition center, but the best part is setting foot on the ship itself.\n\nTo learn more about Dundee's history, head to The McManus art gallery and museum, and for a more in-depth look at the city's once-thriving jute industry, visit Verdant Works Museum.\n\nSt Andrews doesn't have a train station, so you either need to take a direct bus from Edinburgh for about £10, or a £10 train to nearby Leuchars and then a short bus ride from there. Either way, the journey shouldn't take longer than two hours.\n\nSt Andrews is right on the sea, and West Sands beach makes for a lovely walk, even in the winter months. Visitors can also explore St Andrews Castle and St Andrews Cathedral; both buildings are now ruins, but what remains is fascinating and picturesque.\n\nThe town is also famous for golf, with the Old Course — which is regularly used for the Open — being the world's oldest golf course.\n\nI'm not a golf lover, but I still think the course, which features a medieval-era bridge, makes a nice walk … particularly with a Fisher & Donaldson fudge doughnut in hand.",

    "fullText": "This interview is based on a conversation with Emily Susman, 42, a chef and cookbook author from Tulsa, Oklahoma. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI don't blame anyone else for my alcoholism — it was all on me — but I grew up in a family where beer, wine, and liquor were part of the culture.\n\nI'm half Lebanese, and every holiday and other social occasion centered on eating and drinking.\n\nAt 14, my grandfather handed me a vodka and tonic and said, \"This is the way to drink responsibly, surrounded by your family in the safety of home.\"\n\nIn college, I joined a sorority where we partied hard. During rush season, our older sisters presented us with bottles of hard liquor covered with ribbons.\n\nI was never far away from alcohol, whether I was working for my uncle as a bartender or establishing my own successful restaurant and catering firm in Dallas in my thirties.\n\nBut the bad habits really set in after I sold the business and started working with my husband, Drake, 43, at his gas-and-oil brokerage. I was in charge of the books and dealt with the ongoing financial stress by reaching for the bottle.\n\nIt got to the point where I was getting through a large bottle of vodka every few days. I'd hide the evidence in the pantry because I didn't want Drake to see how often it was happening.\n\nI'd use any excuse to drink, whether it was to celebrate the good times or commiserate with myself when something went wrong.\n\nThe tell-tale signs were there. I was overweight from all the wasted calories and my habit of eating more when I was drunk. I'd experience crushing hangovers, get the shakes, and vomit the morning after.\n\nMy family started to get on my case. \"This is a problem for you,\" they would say. \"You need to get your act together.\" Every time, I'd make an excuse. I'll tell them that I'd cut down after Thanksgiving or give up entirely on New Year's Day.\n\nInevitably, I'd be back drinking by Blake's birthday in the middle of January.\n\nThings got even worse when the pandemic began in March 2020. I was often confined to the house and passed the time drinking. I disregarded the needs of my body by not exercising and trying fad diets that weren't sustainable.\n\nThen, a month into 2021, I awoke from a particularly bad episode and stared at myself in the mirror. At 5ft 8in, I was 230 pounds and a size 16. I bawled my eyes out because I was so miserable.\n\nSomething changed. I came downstairs and said to Blake, \"I can't do this anymore.\" I sought therapy and had my last drink in early February.\n\nI realized the all-or-nothing approach that fueled my alcoholism could be redirected to something positive.\n\nIt was a simple process without frills. I took pride in reaching each milestone: five days, then 30 days, then 120 days, and so on.\n\nDistractions made all the difference, whether I was using adult coloring books, painting with acrylics, or even sucking on lollipops when I craved sugar or the oral fixation of drinking.\n\nBest of all, I reignited my love of cooking. I relied on my professional culinary background to make nutritious, balanced meals, which broke the cycle of binge-eating, restricting, and guilt.\n\nMy sensible diet, combined with simple exercises such as walking and strength training, helped me lose 100 pounds. I did it slowly and surely — losing around one pound a week — and now weigh 126 pounds.\n\nI'm a size zero to two and no longer hide my figure in baggy clothing. I've been sober for five years.\n\nAnother benefit is the amount of money I've saved. I found an app that took my average spending on alcohol of $30 a day to calculate that I've saved nearly $55,500 since 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, I launched my company, Emma Claire's Kitchen, the same year I got sober. It offers practical, tasty recipes and products, such as spices and, soon, mocktail powders.\n\nI'm a completely different person from the wreck I saw in the mirror that terrible morning. I love and value myself and am so grateful to Blake and the rest of my family for staying by my side.\n\nIt's scary to think that I nearly lost everything — including my life — to alcohol. I'll never go back to what passed as an existence, just getting through the day.\n\nI have a bright future ahead of me now.",

    "description": "JPMorgan workers can join a waitlist and follow multi-step instructions to buy a toy replica of the new building, which is already reselling for $500.",
    "fullText": "For JPMorgan employees, taking your work home just got a lot more literal.\n\nEmployees who got on an internal waitlist can purchase a $150 LEGO-style replica of the bank's new, $3 billion headquarters at 270 Park Avenue, according to screenshots of waitlist instructions reviewed by Business Insider. A source familiar with the product said the replica sets at the headquarters' internal gift shop sold out quickly when the building first opened. Representatives for JPMorgan declined to comment.\n\nThe bank has been a leader in Wall Street's return-to-office push, and the new building has cemented its commitment to in-person work in the country's financial capital. The scramble for a miniature version of the headquarters also shows how much buzz it's generated. 270 Park Avenue has taken on a life of its own — tourists will stop to take photos in front of the skyscraper, and TikTok is full of videos about the amenities\n\nBuying the toy is no simple process — employees had to get on the waitlist for the 1,903-piece set before February 9. Starting after 10 am on February 26, those on the coveted list had 72 hours to pick up their replica from the shop, which offers everything from JPMorgan merchandise to trendy olive oil.\n\nOnly the employee on the waitlist can pick up the set during the 72-hour window, and they have to show either their JPMorgan ID, a state-issued ID, or their passport. As of now, there are enough replicas for everyone on the waitlist, and any extra sets will be sold on a first-come, first-served basis after March 10.\n\nYet hope will remain for those who miss their waitlist window and don't snag one of the leftovers, since the waitlist will reopen after April 1, according to the screenshots. Appearances aside, the building isn't an official LEGO product, but rather made out of repackaged and \"re-used LEGO elements,\" the box specifies.\n\nThe resale market is already capitalizing on JPMorgan fervor: someone is selling what appears to be the toy for $500 on eBay. The product is 6.5 x 16.3 inches, according to the post, compared to the actual skyscraper's height of 1,388 feet. Multiple platforms, including Walmart and Amazon, are selling dupes of the duped building, though those toys have 3,180 pieces and a slightly altered design.\n\nJPMorgan's new headquarters boasts a suite of offerings beyond repurposed LEGO bricks. The building, which opened in October and can house around 14,000 employees, has an array of restaurants, a pub, a gym, and an ever-waving American flag, to name just a few amenities.\n\nWith its LED lighting display, the 60-story building has changed Manhattan's skyline, easy to spot from across the boroughs. Now, it's moving beyond architecture and subtly changing interior design for those few who can get their hands on the replica.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "The \"Glucose Goddess\" built a brand around her blood sugar balancing hacks. She said a few swaps to her diet boosted her mood, energy, and health.",
    "fullText": "One morning, Jessie Inchauspé, then in her 20s, grabbed her usual sugary breakfast on her way to work in Silicon Valley — and noticed something strange.\n\nWith a cutting-edge tech wearable, she could see her blood sugar spiking, then crashing, in a pattern that mirrored her bouts of brain fog, anxiety, and exhaustion almost exactly, she said.\n\n\"It might seem obvious today that what we eat impacts our mental health, but back then, for me, I hadn't connected the dots,\" Inchauspé told Business Insider.\n\nInchauspé was part of a pilot study using a continuous glucose monitor, or CGM. Once reserved for people with diabetes, the devices were being tested to see how food affected the blood sugar levels, and corresponding mood and energy, of otherwise healthy people.\n\nIt sent her down a rabbit hole. About a decade later, the rest of us are finally starting to catch up. Now, an online audience of more than 5 million people are looking to Inchauspé — better known as the Glucose Goddess — for advice on achieving steady energy and a healthy metabolism.\n\nCGMs have since exploded in popularity among athletes, CEOs, and ordinary people trying to lose weight or to feel less sluggish. Brands like the Stelo, a device from Dexcom that Inchauspé has partnered with, are available without a prescription.\n\nThey may not be for everyone, particularly if intensive tracking makes you feel trapped in \"sugar jail\" as one Business Insider reporter wrote about trying a CGM.\n\nDietitians caution that self-tracking can sometimes lead to overanalyzing normal biological responses as your blood sugar goes through natural spikes and dips throughout the day. The science behind blood-sugar \"optimization\" is still evolving.\n\nStill, Inchauspé said she's seen lasting benefits from understanding her blood sugar and making simple daily tweaks. Three of her top tips are backed by solid evidence to prevent blood sugar spikes and support healthy eating overall.\n\n\"Saying that glucose only matters if you have diabetes is to me like saying brushing your teeth only matters if you have cavities,\" Inchauspé told Business Insider. \"We all feel the effects of our glucose levels on a daily basis.\"\n\nInchauspé said her previous habit of starting the day with cereal or granola seemed healthy, but ended in an afternoon slump.\n\nShe reined in her skyrocketing blood sugar by switching to eggs, Greek yogurt with unsweetened nut butter, or a smoothie with protein powder.\n\nAfter her mood and energy dramatically improved, she said a high-protein breakfast has become a non-negotiable.\n\n\"Anchoring your day with a protein-rich breakfast that keeps you steady is really, really key,\" Inchauspé said. \"It changed how I felt. It changed how I ate, how I was connected to my body.\"\n\nStarting the day with protein, and including it in each meal, is a dietitian-approved way to get enough of the nutrient, although your exact needs will vary based on your weight and goals.\n\nWhole food sources of protein like dairy and eggs, combined with nutrient-dense choices like fruit and nuts, are more satiating for long-lasting energy compared to processed foods like shakes and bars.\n\nCarb-rich foods are often blamed for blood sugar spikes, but Inchauspé is quick to point out that carbs can be healthy.\n\n\"I love pasta, and I could never give up pasta, nor do I want to,\" she said.\n\nContext is key. A dose of fiber at the beginning of a meal helps create a softer landing when the carbs hit your system, slowing digestion so that blood sugar levels cruise along like a gently rolling hill instead of a roller coaster.\n\nInchauspé starts her meals with salad or other fiber-rich vegetables that support healthy digestion, topped with flavorful, low-sugar miso dressing\n\n\"It's not necessarily replacing things, but also just learning when and how to eat them so I can still get all the joy out of them with less impact on my glucose levels,\" she said.\n\nBetween meals, Inchauspé's go-to healthy snack is an apple with peanut butter. The dose of healthy fat and fiber helps to balance out the natural sugars of the fruit.\n\nShe found the combo of fruit and nuts leads to more stable energy than her previous daily snacks. She used to eat grapes, which can be healthy but have a fraction of the fiber, which means the sugars digest more quickly and prompt an energy boost that doesn't last.\n\nIt's just one example of how nuance and balance are crucial when it comes to blood sugar and daily health. Everyone's response to carbs can vary, and some people may be just fine with plain fruit — new research even suggests people have different \"glucotypes\" that influence how their bodies handle sugar.\n\nThat's why dietitians emphasize there's no one-size-fits-all diet for healthy eating.\n\nStill, Inchauspé's advice has garnered a massive following online, a clear sign that people are hungry for data to give them more control over their health. Scientists are still making sense of how the average person might make the most of blood-sugar tracking. For now, consider a common-sense approach to your diet, with plenty of room for nuance and the occasional treat.\n\n\"A donut is not the best thing for your blood sugar, but I would never tell you, 'you could not ever eat a donut ever again,'\" Inchauspé said. \"That would be ridiculous.",

    "description": "A court dismissed the Trump administration's proposed settlement to eliminate the SAVE student-loan repayment plan ahead of schedule.",
    "fullText": "Student-loan borrowers might not lose a key affordable repayment plan just yet.\n\nOn Friday, a court dismissed a proposed settlement announced by the Department of Education and the state of Missouri in December that would have eliminated the SAVE income-driven repayment plan ahead of schedule.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation called for phasing out SAVE by 2028. This latest update means that the department has to stick with that timeline, and it cannot eliminate the plan before 2028 without court approval or a lengthy negotiated rulemaking process.\n\nJohn Ross, Missouri's district court judge, wrote in his ruling that the settlement was not presented to the court, and that federal law allows courts to \"exercise jurisdiction only over cases or controversies,\" which he said does not exist in this case because both the Department of Education and Missouri have agreed on the outcome they're seeking without debate.\n\n\"It appears that there is no longer a live case or controversy sufficient to authorize the Court to enter a judgment on the merits,\" Ross wrote.\n\nThe SAVE plan was created by former President Joe Biden in 2023, and it intended to give borrowers cheaper monthly payments with a shorter timeline to loan forgiveness. The plan has been halted since 2024 due to lawsuits seeking to block it, and while Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation included a provision to eliminate SAVE over the next few years, the settlement would have done so much sooner than anticipated.\n\nRoss also wrote in a footnote that it's \"not lost on the Court that millions of borrowers who enrolled in the SAVE plan have patiently awaited clarity while this litigation has proceeded. However, that clarity must come from the Department of Education, and not from this Court, which is no longer empowered to weigh the merits of a case that is now moot.\"\n\nWinston Berkman-Breen, legal director at advocacy group Protect Borrowers, said in a statement that the court's ruling means the department can now move forward with relief under the SAVE plan.\n\n\"As of today, not only is there no legal barrier to delivering those rights through the SAVE plan, but the Secretary has a legal obligation to do so,\" Berkman-Breen said. \"The U.S. Department of Education must immediately identify borrowers who are eligible to have their loans cancelled under SAVE and instruct their student loan servicers to cancel those loans.\"\n\nA Department of Education spokesperson told Business Insider that the department is evaluating the court's decision.\n\nThe department said in December that, should the settlement be approved, it would not enroll any new borrowers in the SAVE plan, it would deny pending applications, and move the 7 million enrolled borrowers to other repayment plans. Those borrowers would have a limited time to prepare to make their payments.\n\nHave a story to share? Contact this reporter at asheffey@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "From the people who brought you avocado toast: We millennials are bringing the \"chaotic,\" \"unhinged,\" and other generational-coded words to ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "We're all aware of ChatGPT's overuse of the \"—\" emdash and of sentence constructions like \"It's not just X; it's Y.\"\n\nI would like to put forth two other terms that AI seems to overuse. They've become telltale signs of AI's peak millennial personality: chaotic and unhinged.\n\nIt's part of a bigger issue I've noticed with AI — it's full of millennial cringe.\n\nFor a while now, I've noticed those two terms used repeatedly when I use ChatGPT or other LLMs, like Google's Gemini. It got so bad that I recently had to explicitly tell ChatGPT to stop using the word \"chaotic\" while I was attempting to get it to write in the style of the \"jestermaxxing\" and \"frame mogged\" terms that have proliferated online.\n\nYou're probably familiar with the extremes of cringe millennial — that specific kind of online-speak from the 2010s. Things like \"heckin' doggo,\" \"adulting,\" \"smol bean,\" or \"I did a thing.\" It sounds outdated; young people make fun of us for it. (I confess to being a millennial.) I know, it hurts. I don't like it, either, but I accept that time comes for us all, regardless of peptide stack.\n\n\"Unhinged\" and \"chaotic\" are kind of on the cusp here — not totally as obviously timestamped as \"heckin doggo,\" and still widely in use by millennials and Gen Z alike (perhaps even Gen Alpha). Still, I think both words feel kind of dated by 2026.\n\nI'd argue that the origins of these terms' popularity come from classic millennial woke 1.0: the need for new adjectives to replace casual use of words \"crazy\" and \"insane,\" which can be stigmatizing to actual humans with mental illness. Copy desks at news publications discouraged the use of \"crazy\" in their style guides, while many people on social media instead used words like \"wild,\" \"chaotic,\" and \"unhinged.\"\n\nThat aspect is crucial because it directly affected the training data that LLMs were fed for the last few years. Ironically, the chatbot I've noticed uses \"unhinged\" the most is Grok, which was specifically designed to avoid wokeism.\n\nThere's something bigger going on with AI and millennial cringe. It's not just the chatbots — it's images and video, too.\n\nOne thing I couldn't help notice while playing around with Sora 2 was that when I would make a video of myself — using an image I supplied — it would always put me in skinny jeans. Not just me — it seemed to do it for everyone.\n\nSkinny jeans are a funny quirk, because you can imagine exactly how this happened — most of the human history of online video, let's say 2006 to 2019, occurred during a time when skinny jeans were ubiquitous. And then, suddenly, skinny jeans were out of style, a hallmark of out-of-touch millennials. But AI models, packed full of training data with skinny jeans, didn't adapt right away.\n\nI assume that's basically what's happening with all the cringe (a term that I am using even while accepting it's also slightly dated) millennial speak in chatbots. For a good decade, the internet was filled with \"I can't even\" and \"I did a thing\" as well as AAVE and gay-derived slang like \"yaass\" and \"AF\" adopted into the generic millennial lexicon.\n\nAnd all those tweets from 2010 to 2020, Reddit posts, and BuzzFeed articles ended up in the training data that informs how chatbots speak.\n\nHere's where I start to personally feel a little queasy about it all. I was a prolific poster during that time, both on social media and as a professional journalist, contributing untold terabytes of millennial cringe for future AI models to ingest.\n\nI'm not delulu (a Gen Z term that has already fallen off by now) enough to think I personally affected how AI chatbots talk now. It's more that I see myself like how an old boomer hippie thinks back on attending Woodstock and a few protests and believes they helped end the Vietnam War. Not exactly, but also, well, maybe kinda. I was there. I posted cringe. And now AI is doomed to sound like a version of me that makes my skin crawl.\n\nOf course, until it doesn't. This is temporary — AI will keep getting better, it will start to sound more like Gen Z cringe instead of millennial cringe as time passes. Sora will put us in barrel-legged jeans (are those out already?), or eventually skinnies will come back around, and no one will blink an eye. This article will be fed into ChatGPT (Business Insider has a deal with OpenAI), and maybe in the future, if you ask ChatGPT why it says \"unhinged vibes\" so much, it will use this for an answer.",

    "description": "Former US President Bill Clinton addressed recently released photos showing him socializing with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.",
    "fullText": "At the start of his Congressional deposition Friday, Bill Clinton addressed the trove of photos of himself with Jeffrey Epstein released by the Justice Department last year.\n\nIn opening remarks posted on social media, the former President said he didn't have any knowledge of Epstein's sex trafficking operation — despite anyone's \"interpretation of those 20-year-old photos.\"\n\n\"I had no idea of the crimes Epstein was committing,\" Clinton said of the convicted sex offender, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. \"No matter how many photos you show me.\"\n\nClinton posted the remarks ahead of his closed-door deposition in Chappaqua, New York, before members of the House Oversight Committee, which has been investigating Epstein's connections to powerful people.\n\nIn December, in response to the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the Justice Department released several photos showing Clinton with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who is now serving a 20-year prison sentence for trafficking girls to Epstein for sex. The photos show Clinton and Maxwell swimming together in a pool, along with a woman whose face is redacted. They also show Clinton in what appears to be Epstein's private jet with a female, whose face is redacted, on his lap.\n\nThe photos also show Bill and Hillary Clinton at parties and dinners with Epstein.\n\nThe former president has long maintained he had no knowledge of Epstein's sexual abuse. Epstein occasionally visited the White House while Clinton was president, and Clinton has said he traveled internationally with Epstein on his private jet four times between 2002 and 2003, following his presidency, for Clinton Foundation initiatives. There's no indication the two were still in contact by the time Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor in Florida in 2008.\n\n\"As someone who grew up in a home with domestic abuse, not only would I not have flown on his plane if I had any inkling of what he was doing — I would have turned him in myself and led the call for justice for his crimes, not sweetheart deals,\" Clinton said in the opening statement of his deposition.\n\nMaxwell appeared to have her own relationship with the Clintons.\n\nShe worked to obtain funding for the Clinton Global Initiative, records released by the Justice Department show. Maxwell also said in an interview with Justice Department Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche last year that she was closer to Clinton than Epstein was.\n\n\"President Clinton was my friend, not Epstein's friend,\" she said.\n\n\"President Clinton liked me, and we got along terribly well. But I never saw that warmth, or however you want to characterize it, with Mr. Epstein — so I didn't see that,\" Maxwell said in her interview. \"I didn't see President Clinton being interested in Epstein. He was just a rich guy with a plane.\"\n\nBill Clinton's deposition on Friday follows Hillary Clinton's on Thursday. She said she didn't think she ever met Epstein. She has said she met Maxwell on \"a few occasions\" in social settings.\n\nRepublicans on the House Oversight Committee said they would publicly release videos of the depositions of Bill and Hillary Clinton, as they did with a deposition of Les Wexner, the billionaire founder of L Brands, who previously hired Epstein as a financial fixer.\n\nClinton's deposition marks the first time a former president has been compelled to testify to Congress pursuant to a subpoena.\n\nDemocrats on the committee say Clinton's deposition marks a precedent that should require President Donald Trump, who has also been photographed with Epstein, to testify before the committee.",

    "description": "The Pentagon is cutting ties with more elite universities, barring active-duty troops from attendance.",
    "fullText": "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Friday that the Pentagon is formally cutting ties with Ivy League schools and other top universities, barring all active-duty troops seeking graduate-level education from attending specific institutions.\n\nMilitary attendance at select schools will be canceled starting this coming academic year, Hegseth said in an X post, accusing schools of indoctrinating service members with an unexplained \"woke\" ideology.\n\nIt is not clear how this change will affect active-duty students already in the middle of multi-year programs.\n\nThe military's professional military education system has \"been poisoned from within by a class of so-called elite universities who've abused their privilege and access,\" Hegesth said, and have instead become \"factories of anti-American resentment and military disdain.\"\n\nElite schools, such as Princeton, Yale, Columbia, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have \"taken our best and brightest, the men and women who pledged their lives to this nation, and subjected them to a curriculum of contempt,\" the secretary said. \"They've replaced the study of victory and pragmatic realism with the promotion of wokeness and weakness. They've traded true intellectual rigor for radical dogma, sacrificed. Seek free expression for the suffocating confines of leftist ideology.\"\n\nThe Pentagon did not respond to Business Insider's request for specific details on Hegseth's allegations. BI also requested a full list of schools affected by the Friday announcement, which was not provided.\n\nIf a senior officer selected for graduate school is already a top performer, it's unrealistic to think a one- or two-year program would fundamentally change them, said Dan Maurer, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and associate law professor at Ohio Northern University who called the thought of such a sudden personal philosophical change \"far-fetched.\"\n\nHe also said it's valuable to have troops and civilians exposed to one another, as it helps bridge the ever-widening gap between American civilians and their military.\n\nHegseth made the announcement on X on Friday afternoon, just hours after using the platform to announce that the military's relationship with Scouting America (formerly Boy Scouts) will hinge on the nonprofit's acceptance of Pentagon requests to change the program, including halting DEI efforts and barring transgender youth from openly participating in Scouts.\n\nThese universities teach service members \"to despise the very nation they swore to defend,\" and enforce a \"creed of globalist submission,\" he said in the most recent announcement.\n\nA list of 33 schools undergoing DoD review emerged online last week after an Army JAG notified active-duty troops and prospective students that certain schools may no longer be available to them and advised troops to \"have a backup plan.\"\n\nThat leaked guidance noted that Harvard was \"fully off limits,\" a reflection of the Pentagon's previous decision to sever ties with Harvard University. Hegseth, who has a master's degree from Harvard, accused it of being \"one of the red-hot centers of Hate America activism.\" Other schools were marked as risks.\n\nOne prospective student on active duty who hopes to attend one of the schools previously marked for review by the Pentagon told Business Insider the latest announcement from Hegseth has deflated them and may contribute to their decision to leave the military early. They spoke on the condition of anonymity due to concerns about professional repercussions.\n\nA new review is forthcoming for \"senior service\" schools and internal war colleges, the secretary said, \"ensuring they are once again bastions of strategic thought wholly dedicated to the singular mission of developing the most lethal and effective leaders and war fighters the world has ever known.\"\n\nHe did not specify which institutions the review could include, though schools like the National Defense University and each service's war college could be targeted.",

Discovery, giving the David Ellison-run media firm valuable assets such as HBO, CNN, and DC Studios.\n\nNetflix, which was also vying for WBD, declined to raise its bid for the company on Thursday, effectively walking away from its offer to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets.\n\nParamount made multiple offers for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its film studio, HBO, and cable networks such as CNN, rather than the slimmer asset package Netflix had pursued. WBD accepted its revised $31-per-share offer that Netflix declined to counter.\n\nPolitics may have played a role in the bidding war. President Donald Trump publicly expressed disapproval of Netflix's bid, and Republican lawmakers sharply criticized the company at a recent congressional hearing, accusing it of promoting \"woke\" programming. Trump had also demanded that Netflix fire a board member.\n\nInvestor sentiment compounded those headwinds.

You just never know when one quick errand is going to turn into a full day of shopping, catching up with friends, or traveling to the other side of town to satiate a random craving.\n\nI, along with my fellow style editors, have tested a ton of tote bags — like, a ton — but the best luxury totes have an edge over your typical carryall. Beyond acting as a way to carry your laptop, water bottle, and other daily essentials, they elevate your routine with thoughtful design details and quality materials that get better over time.\n\nA luxury tote is worth investing in because they let you take your whole life with you in style. The spacious interior comes in handy whether you're commuting to the office, making a quick trip to the store, or even flying overseas.\n\nIn this guide, we've rounded up our favorite luxury totes that combine lasting quality, intuitive pocket placement, and sophisticated style — the ones that truly justify the splurge. From sculptural suede to slouchy carryalls, here are the very best luxury totes we use for accessorizing with intention.\n\nThe Cuyana Easy Tote is a prime example of quiet luxury. It has a simple exterior, but after years of wear, the smooth, luxe Italian leather carryall has proven itself to be an utter classic.\n\nIt softens and develops character with regular use, making it the ideal investment piece for lowering its cost-per-wear. The unstructured silhouette adapts to whatever you carry — from a laptop and notebook to a water bottle and essentials — without looking bulky or awkward. Even better, the dual handle lengths let you carry it by hand or comfortably over your shoulder (even with a puffy coat on).\n\n\"Cuyana also makes several accessories, like the Classic Tote Insert, for organizing the interior of your bag,\" writes executive editor Sally Kaplan. \"These are great if you like a bit more structure or interior protection since the soft Italian leather is unlined inside. \n\n\"I've had my bag for about 4 years now and I've taken it on every vacation, flight, weekend trip, and long car ride in that time,\" she continues. \"It fits an unbelievable amount of stuff, but it also doesn't look floppy or silly if I just put a few things in it.\"\n\nThis kind of longevity, in addition to the refined minimalist design and pared-back hardware, makes Cuyana's Easy Tote a stylish option that you're bound to get plenty of use from.\n\nRead \n\nI know the KAAI Pyramid is a coveted design because I've seen it often imitated, but never duplicated. In my years of testing fine leather goods, I've never felt a smoother suede than the blue lining of this luxury tote. It serves as the ultimate protection against scratches for my laptop, and puts this structured design in a league of its own.\n\nWhat sets the Pyramid apart is how well it performs both on my commute and at the office. The scratch-resistant, water-resilient leather stays looking sharp through the hustle and bustle, and it usually earns me a compliment in the elevator.\n\nIt's also easy to keep organized, thanks to the interior slip pockets for easy-access essentials, and the fully zipped top makes me feel more secure wearing it on the subway. A nice little touch are the metal feet at the bottom, so I can set it down without the bottom getting dirty.\n\nIt also comes in multiple sizes, from the full-size tote to a Midi and Mini version — in case you have a lighter everyday carry but still want the same look.\n\nOverall, the KAAI Pyramid Tote is a splurge-worthy blend of modern style, substance, and enduring quality — a bag that feels expensive because of how it's made, not because of flashy logos. It's apparent the moment you pick it up.\n\nRead \n\nTumi is one of our favorite splurge-worthy luggage brands our team has tested. Its Contine Weekender manages to fit as much as a duffel and still feels comfortable to carry like a tote.\n\nThe sleek design comes with a ton of organizational features. \"A padded laptop pocket, a spacious shoe compartment, a water bottle holder, and an exterior zip pocket with card slots are just a few of this bag's ample pockets that proved convenient for organizing all my bits and bobs,\" writes style contributor Talia Ergas.\n\nAs a bonus, the shoe compartment is convertible. You can unzip its barrier and turn into a more spacious tote, allowing more room for a bulky makeup bag or puffy jacket.\n\n\"I'd use this bag for work trips or to take to more upscale destinations,\" she continues. \"The bag doesn't come cheap, but it's built to last: My husband has used his Tumi weekender tote for well over a decade (though his specific style has since been discontinued).\"\n\nRead \n\nThe MZ Wallace Metro Tote is made with a featherlight quilted nylon and comes with padded, reinforced handles, which really makes a difference on the shoulders after carrying this tote for a full day.\n\n\"It's easy to convert this tote from a shoulder bag to a crossbody because of the removable strap, and with so many pockets and colors to choose from it's just as practical as it is stylish,\" writes style contributor Rebecca Strong.\n\nLet's talk about those pockets: There are six on the inside and five on the outside, with still room left over for a 13-inch MacBook. \"I never have to worry about digging into the depths of my bag to find my phone charger, lip balm, or whatever else I might need at any given moment,\" adds Rebecca.\n\nGiven the softshell fabric, you can also easily pack the MZ Wallace Metro Tote flat and it won't take up too much space in your carry-on. If you do wear it to the airport, though, you'll be glad to find that its luggage sleeve conveniently slides over your suitcase handle.\n\nRead \n\nI'm sure I don't need to tell you that Coach is a reputable brand, since most people I know have seen a Coach bag up close at some point or another. But since the brand's Tabby has come back in such a big way, I want to give the Brooklyn 39 its flowers — because sometimes you need a rather large unlined leather hobo bag, in case you come home with souvenirs.\n\nThis luxury tote has that trendy oversized shape, which lends well if you're bad at packing light (like me). Crafted from Coach’s signature pebble leather, the bag has a relaxed feel, yet the slightly shiny finish makes it polished enough for formal settings. It's a stylish accessory on the weekend, but serves its purpose as a catch-all when you need it to.\n\nThe strong, malleable leather means you can stuff it to the brim with a laptop, bulky sweater, or 40-ounce water bottle, and it won't protest with any creases or cracks. \"The Brooklyn 39 is so roomy that I call it my Mary Poppins bag,\" says style editor Samantha Crozier. \"For people who like to take an extra pair of shoes to work, this will absolutely hold your heels while you commute in sneakers.\"\n\nThis is one of the most expensive options you'll find in this guide, but the price is justified by just how much stuff this Parker Thatch tote can handle. The huge main compartment and distressed leather means you don't have to be precious about avoiding scuffs or scratches, as other luxury totes demand.\n\n\"I've stuffed it with groceries, spilled iced tea on it, and carried it in the rain with no fear,\" writes style editor Samantha Crozier. \"And after every mishap, the Jack still looks great with its lived-in leather. It's hard to explain how relieving this cognitive shift is, but it's made me reach for this bag all the time.\"\n\nThe Jack immediately feels like a trusty tote you've had for years. With the soft, loosely structured shape and wide opening, you can toss in your everyday carry along with the kids' favorite stuffed animals, a backup pair of shoes, and that package you've been meaning to drop off at the post office. \n\nWhile it doesn't zip shut, you can still tie it closed to retain the boxy shape. Inside is a zippered pocket so you can avoid digging around for your wallet, and the D-rings next to the long drop handles let you add a crossbody strap or decorative key chains.\n\nWhen you add a belt to a luxury tote, you immediately have my attention. I love to see the accessories-wearing-accessories trend in an elevated fashion, so with all the recent press around the Kennedy family, it's a timely opportunity to sport this Tory Burch tote — named after the former president's sister-in-law, style icon Lee Radziwill. \n\nBesides its aesthetic value, the double faced design gives it a practical edge. These outer layers provide even more storage on the outside for dropping in your sunglasses or keys, and they snap shut so the profile stays slim. Inside, the main compartment flares at the base so you can comfortably fit your laptop, toiletry bag, and other essentials within its smooth, suede lining. Leave the belt undone for an intentional devil-may-care effect, or wear it clasped shut to add some structure.\n\nThe price tag is definitely considerable, but true purse girls know the Lee Radzwill line is a major component of Tory Burch's design archive. And if you're going to spend nearly a grand on a luxury tote, isn't it nice for it to have some cultural significance, too?\n\nIf I had to sum up my personal style, I'd call it \"alternative with a corporate job.\" The Hammitt Oliver Zip Tote fits that aesthetic. It's crafted with a buttery soft pebbled leather that feels soft on my skin, so it's comfortable to wear tucked underarm. \n\nHammitt's signature gunmetal rivets give it an edge over mainstream designer bags, yet it still has all the practical details one could want in a tote. For me, that includes a zippered top, exterior slip pocket for my phone, a key leash, and an interior drop pocket for small essentials like my wallet and lip balm.\n\nThe softly structured leather makes this the carry-all ideal for carrying bulky items like books, a toiletry bag, or a light jacket. If you're into the prim-and-proper tote with rigid corners and brassy hardware, look elsewhere. But if you want something that complements your all-black wardrobe and still looks polished, the Oliver is a dependable option.\n\nThis chic, tulip-shaped design from Parisian luxury brand Polène is one I keep seeing worn by stylish passengers on the train. When you untuck the petals it takes on a whole new shape, giving you a versatile luxury tote you can wear two ways.\n\nThe main design drawbacks of the Cyme Tote are its open top and the smooth, coated leather, which is prone to scratches if you're not careful. \"The bag does come with a zippered pouch that you can fasten to the interior, though,\" notes style editor Samantha Crozier, \"so when I take it on the subway, I keep my phone, keys, and wallet in the pouch and leave non-valuables like a sweater, a book, and a water bottle on the outside.\"\n\nAs with any trendy luxury tote, I've seen affordable alternatives pop up that sort of resemble its sculptural shape, only they lack the expensive-looking sheen of Polène's Italian and Spanish leather. The genuine article also has hanging tassels, contrast stitching, and two sets of handles, which let you tote it by hand or over your shoulder.\n\nGabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor: I've spent almost three years testing fine leather goods on the style team at BI Reviews, from legacy brand ballet flats to lesser-known designer handbags. I've found the quality of a leather tote is best proven over time, once the material either ages gracefully with soft signs of wear, or comes apart due to shoddy construction.\n\nBased on my discussions with industry experts, trend research, and an involuntary personal habit of clocking labels all over New York City, I curated this list to include luxury totes that balance functionality with sophisticated style.\n\nRead how the Reviews team tests clothing, shoes, and accessories at Business Insider.\n\nLuxury totes are built with quality materials and craftsmanship that you both feel and see — from full-grain leather that develops a rich patina over time, to reinforced stitching that holds up to stains and strains. Cheaper totes often use lower-grade leather or synthetics that can crack, peel or sag.\n\nBelieve me: I've collected my fair share of canvas totes, and they each served me well — until the rips, stains, wrinkles were too obvious to ignore, and a permanent leather tote made the most sense for someone like me who carries a tote everyday. The durable nature of the material lasts longer, and you can easily find a luxury leather tote with a laid-back style to suit quick errands (such as the Parker Thatch Jack).\n\nLook for luxury totes made in a tannery with a Gold rating from the Leather Working Group. It means the manufacturer is doing the important work of conserving energy, using fewer chemicals deemed harmful for the environment, and maintaining records on the source of its raw materials.\n\nThe grade of leather — whether top-grain, full-grain, or pebbled Italian leather — determines how it changes color, how it feels on your skin, and how well it maintains its structure. Luxury totes are typically made with higher-grade leather that resists scratches, instead developing a lovely patina.\n\nCost-per-wear is calculated by the purchase price divided by how often you use your luxury tote. If you carry yours everyday — and those days become weeks — it quickly increases in value, because the cost spreads out over hundreds of wears. This (eventually) justifies the the initial investment.\n\nSome do, if they become collectors items or come in a classic silhouette that transcends the ever-shortening trend cycle. It also depends on how well you preserve the quality of the luxury tote. Use a leather conditioner and store it in a dust bag away from direct sunlight. This not only makes it last longer, but gives you the option to have it appraised in the future.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

Hegseth also warned that the government could invoke the Defense Production Act — a wartime law that gives the president broad authority over a company's resources — and designate Anthropic as a supply chain risk.\n\nBoth would be unprecedented moves by the government against an American technology company, experts previously told Business Insider.\n\nOn Thursday, Amodei published a blog post stating that the Defense Department had added language to its contract allowing for \"any lawful use\" of its model.\n\nA source familiar with the negotiations told Business Insider that this language effectively gave the military discretion over how it uses Claude.\n\nThe Anthropic CEO said in his post that the company would prefer to continue serving the department but that it could not \"in good conscience accede to their request.\"",

    "title": "Defense Secretary Hegseth says military support for Scouts hinges on ending 'woke' merit badges",
    "description": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the policies of a private youth organization at a moment of high tension in the Middle East.",
    "fullText": "The Pentagon is pulling back on plans to cut ties with Scouting America, as long as the nonprofit organization adopts policies that echo new military directives, including eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and banning transgender youth from the Scouts.\n\nIn a video posted to X Friday, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said he had been \"very seriously considering\" cutting all military support to the organization, citing what he described as its failure to comply with President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at ending \"illegal discrimination and restoring merit-based opportunity.\"\n\nThe move is part of a growing Pentagon campaign to pressure private institutions like AI giant Anthropic, journalists who cover the US military and universities attended by troops to accept the Trump administration's policies and preferences. The move put the defense secretary in the position of telling a private youth organization who can join and what their application asks, and doing so amid a tense build-up in the Middle East that could see the US striking Iran within days or hours.\n\nMilitary support for Scouts has traditionally included logistics to the group's National Jamboree event (which is also a significant military recruiting event) and hosting of Scouts aboard military bases.\n\nThe Pentagon is essentially enforcing Trump's executive order, applicable to government agencies, onto private institutions, said Dan Maurer, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and associate law professor at Ohio Northern University.\n\n\"The fact that they're capitulating at all is a little weird to me, because they can withstand the loss of the connection, frankly,\" Maurer, a former Eagle Scout, said of Scouting America, expressing astonishment that the defense secretary personally focused on this. \"His attention could be focused on other things.\"\n\nScout leaders agreed to \"review and replace politicized, divisive, and discriminatory language throughout the organization,\" Hegseth said in the video, adding, \"no more DEI. Zero.\"\n\nMerit badges that \"mask\" DEI \"activism\" have been \"discontinued,\" he said, and a new military service badge will be added, in partnership with the Pentagon.\n\nScout participants will only be allowed to join based on their birth sex, which may amount to a ban on transgender youth.\n\n\"That means that the application, any application, will have only two sex designations, male and female, and the application must match the applicant's birth certificate,\" the defense secretary said.\n\nIt is not clear how many Scouts would be personally affected by such a shift, and it remains to be seen how families will feel about the Pentagon's involvement in setting terms of their organization.\n\nHegseth said he believed Scouting should return to being a boy-only group, but added that such a change is not imminent.\n\nIn November, an NPR report revealed the Pentagon was weighing whether to sever ties with the organization. As many as 16% of recent cadets at the US Military Academy have scouting in their backgrounds, a percentage that rivaled that of students from high school JROTC programs and reflected the Scouts' deep military ties. Many cadets were also Eagle Scouts.\n\nBeginning in 2012, \"the Boy Scouts lost their way,\" Hegseth said in the Friday post. \"A once great organization became gravely wounded. Diversity, equity and inclusion, DEI, crept in. The name was changed to 'Scouting America.' Girls were accepted. The focus on God as the ruler of the universe was watered down to include openness to humanism and Earth centered pagan religions.\"\n\n\"They even welcomed the destructive myth of gender fluidity and transgenderism to infiltrate their membership. Along the way, standards were lowered and merit destroyed in favor of an insidious, radical woke ideology that is anti-America and anti-American.\"\n\nThe Scouts said they had made changes to comply with the Trump administration's policies after months of discussion.\n\n\"Scouting America is proud to uphold our longstanding commitment to military families across the globe through a renewed, strengthened partnership with the Department of War,\" Scouting America said in a statement to Business Insider, referring to the Trump administration's unofficial name for the Defense Department that Congress has not approved.\n\n\"Over several months, we engaged in dialogue with Department leadership to align on how we could deepen our service to military families, while making programmatic updates to comply with Executive Order 14173.\"\n\nHegseth did not specify what policy changes he was referring to in 2012, though in 2013 openly gay youth were allowed to join.\n\nThe Boy Scouts adopted changes to address declining participation that was caused, in part, by thousands of decades-old child sexual abuse cases finally made public in 2012, said David Chetlain, a Navy veteran and former Boy Scout, who expressed concern about the Pentagon's pressure campaign.\n\nThe so-called 'perversion files' eventually contributed to Scouting America filing for bankruptcy in 2020. Opening ranks to a more diverse array of participants was part of the group's attempt to maintain relevance and cleanse its reputation, Chetlain said.\n\nVarious religious merit awards have been around for decades, he added, and reflect the diversity of the group, which has foreign members across the world. Two Japanese exchange scouts were in his own troop, he said, recalling his time as a young Scout in the 1970s and 1980s, and as an occasional leader since then.\n\n\"It's always been multicultural. It's always been agnostic to religion or accepting of all religions,\" said Chetlain, though he noted that Scouts previously barred atheists for decades. \"Even as a kid, I loved that inclusivity and having a place where everybody belonged and we were all accepted. And it was a safe place for me.\"",

    "fullText": "After years of internal buzz and false starts, Microsoft is considering rolling out its long-rumored E7 enterprise productivity software bundle, a pricier, AI-loaded version of Microsoft 365, according to two people familiar with the plans.\n\nMicrosoft 365 is a popular suite of productivity software that includes widely used tools such as Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Microsoft sells this software primarily in bundles called E3 and E5, where the E stands for \"enterprise.\" E3 is a more basic offering, while E5 has more bells and whistles.\n\nA larger, more expensive \"E7\" software bundle has long been rumored and has earned a kind of mythical status inside Microsoft, with employees and salespeople debating and guessing whether it will ever appear.\n\nMicrosoft's AI-packed E7 bundle comes as competitors like Google, Salesforce, and nearly every major software-as-a-service company rush to embed AI tools and autonomous agents into their products. Software stocks have taken a significant hit this year as investors worry that generative AI tools will upend traditional software products.\n\nThe new E7 bundle under consideration includes everything in the E5 bundle, plus AI features such as Microsoft Copilot and the company's new AI agent hub, Agent 365, the people said.\n\nMicrosoft is looking into per-seat and consumption-based pricing for E7, but could charge up to $99 per user per month, the people said. E5's current advertised price is $57 per user per month while Copilot is advertised as an add-on for $21 per user per month.\n\nThe company previously floated a new AI software bundle in 2024, but paused the plan.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "A midair crash prompted a bill that would have mandated new anti-collision alerts. Safety advocates say a revised GOP bill doesn't do enough.",
    "fullText": "Lawmakers appear to be at an impasse after the failure of a bipartisan bill that would have mandated something most airline cockpits still lack: a real-time view of other aircraft.\n\nThe ROTOR Act failed in the House by a single vote. It had passed with bipartisan support in the Senate and backing from families of crash victims of the January 2025 collision involving an American Airlines jet. It also had the support of pilot and flight attendant unions, airlines, and the National Transportation Safety Board.\n\nAdvocates say they will oppose a new GOP bill that does not mandate cockpit monitors.\n\nFamilies were unhappy with the bill's failure to garner the two-thirds majority needed to pass a procedural measure on Tuesday: \"It was defeated by eleventh-hour objections built on misleading technical claims the NTSB's own investigators have publicly refuted,\" they said in a joint statement.\n\nThe bill split House Republicans, with some of the 132 opponents saying the additional monitoring systems would be expensive and were unproven; some are advocating for an alternate bill, the ALERT Act, that leaves air traffic controllers primarily responsible for collision alerts and allows some military flights to opt out of transmitting their positions.\n\nAt the heart of the debate was a proposed requirement to equip commercial aircraft with GPS-based \"ADS-B In,\" which would display nearby air traffic on the flight deck screen — potentially closing the gap revealed by last year's AA crash with an Army helicopter near Ronald Reagan National Airport that killed 67 people. Overstretched air traffic controllers had struggled to track the mix of commercial and military flights in DC's crowded airspace that day.\n\nCommercial aircraft have been required to carry the sister technology, \"ADS-B Out,\" since 2020, which feeds their position to air traffic control. Think of it like ADS-B Out is talking and ADS-B In is listening. ADS-B Out has drastically improved safety by being more precise than radar and enhancing pilot situational awareness.\n\nSupporters of the ROTOR Act — which would also require certain military planes to broadcast their position in civilian airspace — argued that adding these monitors would allow pilots, as the last line of defense, to react to hazards when seconds count.\n\nIn comments shared with Business Insider, Syracuse University professor and aviation safety expert Kivanc Avrenli said the use of ADS-B In on the American jet would have given its pilots 59 more seconds to react before impact. In reality, the traffic-avoidance collision alert came only 19 seconds before, he said, and maneuver instructions weren't possible due to altitude limits.\n\n\"In dense airspace, that extra 40 seconds can be the difference between having time to sort out a conflict and having no real options left,\" he said. \"Delaying these upgrades means continuing to rely on systems that simply were not built for this kind of scenario.\"\n\nADS-B In would not only help in flight but also on the ground, where a series of runway incursions has exposed the limits of what controllers can handle in real time. In the months after the January accident, two separate military aircraft had close calls with US passenger jets.\n\nThe Pentagon initially supported the original bill. On Monday, it changed its position and said the technology risks \"significant unresolved budgetary burdens and operational security risks affecting national defense activities.\" Some Republicans came out against the bill and threw their weight behind a different effort.\n\nHouse Republicans Mike Rogers and Sam Graves, who voted no to ROTOR, have instead pushed a revised version of the bill.\n\nDuring a Senate hearing on Monday, Graves said ALERT would be a \"comprehensive package\" that would enhance military coordination and pilot training and address all 50 NTSB recommendations. He said the ROTOR Act only addresses two of the recommendations.\n\nALERT would not require ADS-B use — essentially maintaining the current system that relies on air traffic controllers to detect potential conflicts in and around airports and communicate with pilots. It would also absolve military aircraft of having to use the anti-collision technology in certain airspaces, citing security risks.\n\nGraves added that ADS-B In would be a burden to implement on the 5,500 planes in the sky, would \"unintentionally lead to an operational crisis in 2031,\" and be an \"unworkable\" mandate.\n\nNTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy — who oversees the research and writing of the agency's recommendations — said on Thursday that the House's ALERT bill is \"watered down\" and won't do enough to prevent future accidents, adding that the bill doesn't address all of the NTSB's recommendations because it takes out the ADS-B In requirement.\n\nThe NTSB has recommended ADS-B In on cockpit displays since 2008. The Federal Aviation Administration has never mandated it, partly because it lacks a clear funding mechanism. Regulators have argued that the system, which provides visual and audio alerts, would impose a cost burden on airlines and on private plane owners who may not operate in congested airspace.\n\nHomendy told a Senate Committee in February that American Airlines paid less than $50,000 per plane to retrofit roughly 300 Airbus A321s, as an industry example. That adds up fast across hundreds of aircraft. She said general aviation planes could carry portable receivers that cost as little as $400.\n\nSome airlines, including American and JetBlue, have voluntarily added ADS-B In to their planes.",

    "description": "The Trump administration scheduled a Friday flight to bring a deported college student back from Honduras after a judge ordered her return, but she declined",
    "fullText": "BOSTON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - The Trump administration scheduled a Friday flight to bring a deported college student back from Honduras after a judge ordered her return, but she declined to board ‌the plane after U.S. authorities said they may detain and deport her again.\n\nAny Lucia Lopez Belloza, a ‌freshman at Babson College in Massachusetts, had been deported to a country she left when she was 8, after being detained at Boston's Logan International ​Airport while traveling to spend Thanksgiving with her family in Texas.\n\nThe 20-year-old was flown to Honduras on November 22 despite a Massachusetts judge's order the prior day barring her from being deported or transferred out of the state for 72 hours. A government lawyer later apologized for what he called a \"mistake.\"\n\nBoston-based U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns on February 13 ordered President Donald ‌Trump's administration to rectify the error it ⁠made during its immigration crackdown by Friday by facilitating her return.\n\nLopez Belloza told reporters she had been excited to learn on Thursday the administration had arranged for a flight to ⁠take her home.\n\n\"Hours later, that excitement turned into a nightmare,\" Lopez Belloza said.\n\nShe said a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer misled her by repeatedly telling her on Thursday that if she boarded the plane, she would be released upon landing in the ​United States.\n\n\"I ​believed him for a second,\" she said. \"I pictured stepping off ​of the plane and finally being free.\"\n\nYet in ‌court filings on Thursday afternoon, the administration said it planned to move to deport her again once she arrived. It said it had the authority to detain her if she took the ICE flight from Honduras to Texas because she was already subject to a final order of removal, which was issued when she was 11.\n\n\"I won't mince words,\" Lopez Belloza said during a virtual press conference. \"I am angry. I am sad.\"\n\nTodd Pomerleau, Lopez Belloza's lawyer, accused the administration of \"gamesmanship\" ‌and vowed to continue her legal fight.\n\n\"I'm not stopping until she's ​back here, but she's not coming back in handcuffs,\" he said.\n\nIn a ​court filing later on Friday, the administration said ​Lopez Belloza failed to appear for a pre-arranged meeting to assist with her departure and ‌did not board the scheduled flight after previously agreeing ​to come to an airport ​in San Pedro Sula, Honduras.\n\nA spokesperson for U.S. Attorney Leah Foley, whose office has been fighting Lopez Belloza's legal challenge, in a statement said the ICE-arranged flight was intended to restore the \"status quo.\"\n\n\"The status quo that ​existed prior to her removal was that ‌she was subject to a final order of removal and as the government argued throughout this case, ​ICE has statutory authority to detain an individual to effectuate such removal,\" the spokesperson, Christina Sterling, ​said.",

When a reporter asked why she sent the picture to Johnson, Boebert responded, “Why not?” She also told reporters that she had “just returned to my hotel room and installed the BleachBit software,” referring to a disk cleaning program for Windows, adding, “So I guess in regards to taking photos, I do not recall.”",

    "description": "Samsung just announced the new earbuds, but you can already pre-order them with a gift card from Amazon.",
    "fullText": "Samsung just announced its new earbuds during the Samsung Unpacked 2026 event earlier this week, and Amazon is already offering a pretty sweet deal to preorder them. The Samsung Galaxy Buds 4 are $179.99 and come with a $20 Amazon gift card, and the Samsung Galaxy Buds 4 Pro go for $249.99 and come with a $30 Amazon gift card. Both will be released on March 11, but you can pre-order them now. Considering these will be their flagship earbuds for some time, it's a great opportunity for any Samsung fan or anyone curious about Samsung's new earbuds to snatch them up.\n\nSamsung wants to compete with Apple, with a similar design, features, and even price point. The Samsung Galaxy Buds 4 are strikingly similar to the Apple AirPods 4 in their design, with noise cancellation and the absence of silicone eartips that go inside your ears. They come with Hi-Res audio, IP54 for water-resistance, a Live Translation feature similar to Apple's, a new design, improvements in call quality, and direct access to ask questions to AI and receive responses through the earbuds. The controls are swipe and pinch, and the charging case comes in black or white.\n\nIt's also easy to draw the similarities between the Samsung Galaxy Buds 4 Pro and the Apple AirPods Pro 3. Apart from both being $249, the most obvious similarity is the in-ear silicone tip design that helps seal the noise and improve ANC. The Pros have all of the same features as the Buds 4, and are supposed to be more comfortable, have better ANC which Samsung calls ANC 2.0, have a better water resistance with an IP57 rating, which handles immersion in water up to 1 meter, and perhaps more importantly, a two-way speaker (as opposed to a one-way on the Buds 4) that is meant to delivers better, high-fidelity sound, superior separation of frequencies, and reduced distortion. But we will only know if these claims are true when we get our hands on them for a review.",

    "description": "Where exactly is he going?",
    "fullText": "For someone like the former prince Andrew the idea of jail probably seems absurd. He’s lived a life of impunity, no matter what he has done, protected by the British royal family he was born into. That’s probably why he looked so shellshocked in pictures taken outside the police station when he was released after being questioned for 11 hours. Now, with the investigation into his dealings with Epstein and his misconduct in public office, there’s a real possibility he could face jail time. And that, reportedly, isn’t sitting well with Andrew.\n\nRadarOnline.com is reporting that he is looking to hide “under the coat-tails” of his former fixer, David Stern. Stern, who was named more than 7,400 times in the new batch of the Epstein files, is reportedly living in Abu Dhabi. He is said to be a close friend of both Andrew and Epstein.\n\nCharles May Be Questioned by Police For Andrew's Arrest to See What He Was 'Aware' of: 'No One Is Beyond Being Asked'\n\nThe Fate of Beatrice & Eugenie's Places in the Line of Succession Revealed Amid Reports Andrew Is Willing to Sacrifice His Spot to 'Keep Him Out' of Prison\n\nEmails show Stern writing to Epstein: “I am always on your team!” and referring to him as “boss” and a “good friend.” He also informed Epstein of Andrew’s movements, sharing itineraries and details of trade trips. Now, a source close to the investigation into Andrew’s links to Epstein said: “The sheer frequency with which Stern’s name appears in the files has immediately elevated him from a peripheral figure to someone investigators regard as central to understanding how these networks operated.”\n\n“As a result, there is an active effort underway to determine precisely where he is based and to assess whether he would be willing – or compelled – to cooperate with any formal inquiries.”\n\nIt is not known if Andrew and Stern remain in contact, but there has been speculation that the former prince might seek refuge with Stern. He is currently in Wood Farm, at Sandringham, where he moved after he vacated Royal Lodge. An insider told the outlet, “If Andrew manages to flee somewhere like Abu Dhabi, it will make investigating him further very difficult. He is now basically being looked at as a flight risk.”\n\nAndrew was arrested on February 19, on his 66th birthday, and police have conducted searches in multiple properties associated with him. He is still being investigated for misconduct in public office due to reported communications he had with Epstein, where he shared highly confidential information that he knew because of his work as a trade envoy for Britain.\n\nThe maximum sentence for the offense is life behind bars.\n\nKing Charles released a statement right after his brother’s arrest, saying, “I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office. What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities.”\n\nHe added, “In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and co-operation. Let me state clearly: the law must take its course. As this process continues, it would not be right for me to comment further on this matter. Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.”\n\nThe 26 Best Romantic Comedies to Watch if You Want to Know What Love Feels Like\n\nThese ‘Bachelor’ Secrets & Rules Prove What Happens Behind the Scenes Is So Much Juicier\n\nBTS's 7 Members Were Discovered in the Most Unconventional Ways",

    "title": "Peloton Just Launched a 12-Week Hyrox Training Program",
    "description": "Hyrox is the new Crossfit, and Peloton is still good-ol' Peloton.",
    "fullText": "If you've been eyeing a Hyrox race, but weren't sure how to train for one, Peloton may have just solved your problem. The fitness platform announced today the launch of a 12-week Hyrox training program, timed specifically for athletes preparing for the upcoming Hyrox NYC events taking place May 28-31 and June 4-7, 2026. And if you're not racing in New York, don't worry—the program lives in Peloton's library for all members, meaning you can start it 12 weeks out from any Hyrox event on your calendar.\n\nBefore diving into the program, a quick primer for the uninitiated. As my colleague Beth Skwarecki explains here, your friend who used to be obsessed with Crossfit is probably now obsessed with Hyrox (unofficially short for \"hybrid rockstar\"). Hyrox is a fitness competition designed for athletes who don't quite see themselves as pure endurance athletes or pure strength athletes, but something in between.\n\nWhat seems to make Hyrox unique—or at least, uniquely appealing—is its consistency. Unlike Crossfit competitions, where the format can change dramatically from event to event, every single Hyrox race follows the same predictable structure: eight 1-kilometer runs, with a functional fitness station in between each one. Those stations include things like sled pushes, wall balls, rowing, and ski erg work, adding up to roughly 5 miles of running plus eight rounds of serious effort. Because the format never changes, you can compare your finish time against anyone else who has ever raced Hyrox, much like comparing marathon times.\n\nBut one thing that sets Hyrox training apart from something like classic marathon prep is that it's inherently communal. While you can train for a race on your own with nothing but a good pair of shoes, Hyrox training requires access to a rowing machine, a ski erg, a sled, and a wall ball target—in other words, the sort of equipment that's hard to come by outside of gyms geared toward this kind of training. (For the record, most Crossfit gyms and a growing number of commercial gyms can accommodate these types of workouts, but it's worth calling ahead.) That shared training environment tends to foster a community that athletes say is a big part of the draw.\n\nPeloton's new 12-week program is structured around six training days per week, with many days including both a strength and a run component. Classes include strength, running, rowing, tread bootcamps, mobility and stretching, and meditation. As a regular ol' race runner myself, I’m drawn to the ways these classes cover so many different disciplines.\n\nWeek 12 is race week, so the training load lightens considerably as athletes taper toward the starting line. There aren't many workouts that final week, but one notable inclusion is a Hyrox pre-race meditation, which I find speaks to the program's whole community-based philosophy.\n\nThe program is grounded in five core principles that Peloton describes as the five pillars of Hyrox performance:\n\nAerobic Power: Threshold work starts on Day 1, teaching athletes how to manage effort and develop sustainable high gears over time.\n\nSimple Tools, High Impact: The program leans on running, the erg, and strength training as its primary vehicles for building hybrid endurance.\n\nEfficiency Over Speed: Rather than chasing raw pace, the focus is on smart pacing and clean technique that conserves energy across transitions.\n\nProgressive Volume: Training load builds deliberately over the weeks, developing the ability to perform under cumulative fatigue.\n\nPerformance Drivers: Recovery, fueling, and mindset are treated as training components, not afterthoughts.\n\nTaking a look at the program here, its structure reflects these principles in a clear arc. The first six weeks focus on building what Peloton calls the \"aerobic engine\" and establishing threshold control, laying the foundation before intensity picks up. By Week 7, athletes complete a 75-minute simulation designed to test their pacing strategy and transition skills under realistic race conditions. The final weeks then shift toward what the program describes as \"real demand\" training, simulating the fatigue carryover of heavy sled pushes and wall balls bleeding into running. Like with any good training program, the goal is to arrive at race day sharp and well-prepared, not worn down.\n\nNeedless to say, you need an active Peloton membership. And for now, the Hyrox program can only be joined from the Peloton app or Peloton hardware like the Peloton Bikes, Tread, Row, and Guide. You can’t join from the Peloton website or TV apps. To find it on your device, you can browse the programs area, find the Hyrox Training program, and hit join.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Meta Quest User Should Know",
    "description": "Unlock the full power of your Meta Quest 3 or 3S with these tweaks, downloads, and hidden settings.",
    "fullText": "Meta's strategy for its Quest 3 and 3S VR headsets is clearly to make virtual and mixed reality as easy, fun, and affordable as possible, but they might have done the job a little too well. All that user-friendliness has left a lot of power on the table. Casual Questers don't know that the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor is powerful enough to handle spatial computing and multitasking that rivals some laptops, and that they can link their headset to a PC for close-to-4K visuals that rival much more expensive headsets. With the right software and a little bit of monkeying around with (often-hidden) settings, you can take the Quest 3 and 3S way beyond its the out-of-the-box performance. Below are ten hacks every Meta Quest user should know to get the most out of their headset.\n\nIf you choose just one hack, it should be downloading Quest Game Optimizer. QGO is a third-party utility that lets you control a ton of hidden settings for any Quest game or app. Meta typically locks its hardware to conservative clock speeds to preserve battery and thermal headroom, but QGO lets you force the Quest's chip to work at its maximum power. Most impressively, it lets you to increase the internal render resolution up to 300%, effectively \"supersampling\" your games to match the high-fidelity density of the Quest 3’s pancake lenses. It really makes a difference.\n\nAs you might have guessed, you won't find QGO on the official Meta Store, and it takes some lightly hacker-ish work to set up. To get it running, you'll need to:\n\nPurchase the software. It's currently $9.99 on itch.io.\n\nCreate a developer account with Meta. This is free, and you can do it from inside your headset.\n\nEnable Developer Mode on your Meta account.\n\nUncompress the QGO app. Either sideload the compressed Android file on your PC using a tool like SideQuest, or unzip it straight in the headset using a file manager like AnExplorer or Mobile VR Station.\n\nGrant Accessibility Permissions within the headset to allow the optimizer to override system defaults.\n\nThat's the gist, but check out these deeper guides for how to do all of the above with just your Quest headset, with SideQuest and a PC, and through Meta Quest's developer's mode.\n\nYou can take the Quest 3 beyond standalone by linking it to your PC, either tethered or with a virtual link. This offloads the computing to a more powerful processor, turns your headset into a high-def display, and lets you use programs like Half-Life: Alyx or Microsoft Flight Simulator that would be impossible to run natively. You'll seriously be shocked at how good they look and how smoothly they run. You can do this in two ways:\n\nThis is the best choice for the highest possible fidelity visuals and the easiest set-up, plus you don't have to worry about how fast your wifi works.\n\nOpen the Meta Horizon Link app on your PC.\n\nGet a high-quality USB-C 3.1 cable or the Meta Link Cable, and plug it in.\n\nFollow the instructions on your headset.\n\nThis is the choice if you want the freedom of wireless connection and you have really reliably wifi.\n\nFor best results, connect your PC to your router via Ethernet, make sure your Quest 3 is on a 5GHz or 6GHz (Wi-Fi 6E) band, and use the Quest and PC in the same room.\n\nRun Meta Horizon Link on your PC.\n\nIn the Quest, go to \"quick settings\" and select the \"Link\" tile.\n\nSwitch \"Use Air Link\" to \"On,\" select your PC, and hit \"Pair.\"\n\nClick \"Launch\" and you'll be streaming directly from your PC to your face computer.\n\nMeta lets users test out \"coming soon\" features in its experimental menu and get an early look at \"quality-of-life\" improvements, most of which will be heading to the Quest soon. Among other improvements, the current experimental menu contains a couple of bangers: \"lying down mode,\" and \"Meta AI\" integration. Here's how to check it out:\n\nScroll down to the Experimental tab on the left-hand sidebar.\n\nToggle the features you want to try.\n\nThis brand new (as of February 2026) feature is evidence of how hard Meta is leaning into mixed reality. Spatial locking lets you anchor windows wherever you want in physical space, so you can look at your real television and see a virtual one, have three virtual monitors extending your workspace, or create a window to YouTube over your sink for when you're washing dishes. Bonus: The Quest will remember where these windows are when you restart it.\n\nMake sure you're in pass-through mode.\n\nGrab the window with the control bar at the bottom and move it where you'd like.\n\nSelect the \"anchor\" icon on the control bar.\n\nThis won't work with travel mode. But speaking of travel mode...\n\nYes, you'll look sort of dorky on a plane, but the Quest 3's travel mode makes it possible to use your Quest on the road by creating a stationary boundary, and setting the Quest to ignore external velocity and rely only on head movements. Here's how to turn it on:\n\nClick on \"Environmental Set Up.\"\n\nBigscreen Beta is the go-to video streaming app on Quest headsets. It allows you to sit in a highly detailed virtual environment—a cozy modern living room, a massive outdoor drive-in, another planet, etc.—and stream video. You can use the Bigscreen Remote Desktop tool on your PC to stream content from Netflix, Disney+ or just about anywhere else directly into your virtual environment. Not only that, you can stream content directly from Bigscreen into your private space, invite friends over to watch with you, or watch movies and TV with strangers in shared virtual theaters.\n\nIf you have an Xbox Live account, you can play (2D) Xbox games right from your VR headset, giving you a portable game console with a 100\" screen. Here's how it works:\n\nDownload the XBox app on your Quest headset.\n\nPair a controller with your Quest. Quest controllers aren't made to work with XBox games, so you'll have to use Bluetooth to pair a game controller to your Quest. You can use an XBox controller, a PS5 controller, a Switch 2 controller, and a ton of generic controllers.\n\nRun the Xbox app and choose a game.\n\nEnable passthrough. This lets you play your game on as big a screen as you'd like while still being in the \"real\" world.\n\nThere can be some latency, as the game is being run from the cloud, but it's surprisingly smooth in my experience.\n\nWebXR might be the Quest's biggest secret. It lets you use a seemingly infinite number of games and apps that are not available in the Meta store, and are almost all free. Since WebXR apps are browser based, all you have to do is point your Meta browser to a site that hosts a WebXR program and hit go. If you like experimental little tests and whatnot, you'll never run out. Here are some to check out:\n\nMoon Rider: A totally free, open-source alternative to Beat Sabre.\n\nSilkbrush: A web-based version of the famous Tilt Brush that lets you paint in 3D space.\n\nAbove Par-adowski: A surprisingly deep browser-based miniature golf game.\n\nYou can do a lot with your Quest without even turning it on. The Meta Horizon mobile app lets you manage your library, download games, change your settings, and more, all without strapping anything to your face. Browsing the Meta store feels way more natural on the app, and it's easier to navigate and change setting there too. Plus, the app can tell you how much charge is left in your battery, whether your friends are online, download screenshots and videos, and cast what's going on in your headset to another screen.\n\nThe Meta Quest 3 is ergonomically fine for shorter sessions, but if you wear it long enough, you realize how much the design is a battle between comfort and performance, and it compromises on both ends—it's kind of heavy and the battery life is kind of short. The front-weighted design puts pressure on your face and the battery life rarely survives a two-hour session, but there's a solution to both problems: Trade the stock fabric strap for a third-party \"Elite\" style strap with a built in extra battery, like the KIWI design H4 Boost or the BOBOVR S3 Pro. These move the extra weight to the back of your head, balancing the ergonomics, and they have swappable extra batteries so you can use your headset as long as you'd like.",

    "fullText": "Ever since I deleted my Facebook account, Instagram has taken its place as the social network I visit most often to check what my friends are up to. I've been on the app for something like 15 years now, and during this time, I've learned a trick or two that improve the experience (or at least make it less annoying). Here are 10 Instagram hacks that will enhance your privacy, reduce the amount of junk in your feed, help you reset your algorithm, and more.\n\nOn every social media app, I like to set up filters to mute offensive keywords, but you can use keywords to block almost anything you don't want to see. On Instagram, you can use filters to easily block spammy comments and offensive messages. While you can customize your filter list, I just looked up a list of offensive phrases, and quickly added it to my IG account, then added a few additional terms.\n\nYou can do the same thing by going to your Instagram profile page, and tapping the three-lines menu in the top-right corner in Instagram. This opens the Settings and activity page, where you can select Hidden Words. It lets you add multiple words, as long as you separate them with a comma. Once added, Instagram will block comments and messages containing those terms.\n\nYou can also add mute keywords for posts appearing in your feed. Go to Instagram Settings > Content preferences > Specific words and phrases. On the Content preferences page, go to Sensitive content and Political content, and you can limit those types of posts and videos from showing up on your feed too.\n\nEvery once in a while, my Instagram algorithm goes haywire and I'm forced to reset it. After all, I mostly open this app to see my friends' updates and cat videos, and once my feed starts showing me too much Hyrox content (a \"sport\" I couldn't care less about), I know I'm in trouble. If something like this happens to you, there are two ways to reprogram your feed. The easy option is to just look for a reel you enjoy (such as a cat video), and swipe upwards a few times till you reach a non-cat video, then navigate away. Repeat this process a few times and your feed will be back to more cat videos and less Hyrox (or anything else).\n\nIf that doesn't work, or if your feed is too far gone in the wrong direction, then you can go to Instagram Settings > Content preferences > Reset suggested content to reboot it entirely.\n\nWhen you share any post, reel, story, or other type of content on Instagram, the app tracks who you're sharing it with, even if you send the link outside Instagram. You can see this by tapping the Share button on any post, and selecting Copy link: Paste this link in any text editor, such as Apple Notes or Google Keep, and you'll see that the link has tracking parameters at the end, such as \"?igsh=…\" or \"?utm…\". That helps Instagram identify that you've shared the link.\n\nThere's no way to disable this tracking, but you can manually remove it from each link before you send it to someone. Just paste the URL it as usual, then delete everything after the question mark.\n\nWhenever you open a link in Instagram, the app opens it in an in-app browser. This is the least privacy friendly option, as Instagram can then track which websites you're visiting quite easily. You can partially stop this by tapping the three-dots button in the top-right corner of Instagram's in-app browser and selecting Open in external browser.\n\nThere's no way to make this the default setting for all links, but you can set it as default for links you receive via DM. To do this, go to Instagram Settings > App website permissions > Message links and turn on Open in external browser.\n\nAfter you post something, Instagram loves to spam you with notifications every time a few people interact with the post. Even if you don't use Instagram for a day or two, you'll still get a deluge of notifications from the app. I don't face this problem because I never allow Instagram permission to send any notifications on my devices, but that's not an option for everyone. If you don't want to turn off notifications entire, you can choose to receive only the useful notifications from Instagram. To do this, go to Instagram Settings > Notifications and review all the options available to you. I particularly like the Messages only option, which only sends me an alert when someone DMs viaon the app.\n\nTo further limit notifications, go to the Following and followers section on this page, and disable Account suggestions. Similarly, you can go to Messages and disable Message reminders and all varieties of channel notification settings. You can also go to the Calls section and turn off Video chats, which has the added bonus of disabling video calls on Instagram, which I've never wanted to use.\n\nFor some reason, Instagram shows other people when you're online. If you want to be more discreet, go to Instagram Settings > Messages and story replies > Show activity status and turn the setting off. (On the previous page, you can select Show read receipts and turn it off to stop people seeing if you've read their messages too.)\n\nWhen someone is messaging you on Instagram, the app shows you an animation to tell you that the other person is typing. More often than not, this feature only makes me keep the app open longer while the other person types their message, which is probably why Instagram's added it in the first place. If you don't want to see the typing indicator in a chat, you can disable it: Open any chat in Instagram and tap the contact's name up top. Go to Privacy and safety and turn off Typing indicator. Sadly, you'll need to do this manually for each of your Instagram chats.\n\nInstagram chats are not encrypted by default, which means that the company can read all your messages. If you want to beef up your security, consider using end-to-end encryption for your chats. Just like Telegram, Instagram hides its end-to-end encrypted chat feature, and makes you enable it manually for each chat. You can do so by opening any chat in Instagram, tapping the contact's name up top, selecting Privacy and safety > Use end-to-end encryption.\n\nYour Instagram search history shows up whenever you try to search for anything on Instagram. This can be embarrassing if you've looked up something really silly (or slightly naughty), and someone else sees it. to prevent this, you can clear your searches by tapping the search bar in Instagram, and selecting Clear all, or tapping the x next to each search term.\n\nHowever, there's also a way to automatically clear your search history on Instagram: Go to Instagram Settings > Accounts Center > Your information and permissions > Search history > Keep searches for, and select 3 days, which is the minimum time for automatically deleting your searches.\n\nThere's no way to block ads on Instagram, but you can reduce the amount of your data that Instagram uses to show you those ads. Just go to Instagram Settings > Accounts Center > Ad preferences > Manage info. You can go through each option on this page and turn off everything you can. Under Categories used to reach you, select Remove on every option.\n\nYou can choose Don't allow us… in these two categories: Ads in other apps and Ads about Meta. Finally, you can select Activity information from ad partners > Review setting, and pick No, don't make my ads more relevant.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A crowd gathered at a commuter gate at Reagan National Airport on Friday as fog-laden Washington skies caused an hourlong ground stop that backed up passengers hoping to head out from American Airlines' Terminal D.\n\nBut soon the already densely packed area swelled even more, as word spread across nearby gates that, of the hundreds of air travelers coming and going, only one among them was accompanied by a U.S. Secret Service detail, along with uniformed local police officers: former President Joe Biden.\n\nBiden, who has rarely made public appearances since leaving office last year, sat, like many of his fellow passengers, awaiting a flight that would take him to Columbia, South Carolina, for an evening event with the South Carolina Democratic Party.\n\nPassengers whispered and gaped in wonder: Why would a man who for a time was leader of the free world be, like they were, at the mercy of airport travel delays, even as he sat ensconced in his security detail?\n\nMaybe for Biden it made more sense than for some other former presidents. Known for years as Amtrak Joe, Biden as a senator prided himself on becoming arguably the nation’s biggest Amtrak fan, regularly taking the train home to Delaware rather than taking up residence in Washington. Now, as a former president, he's been spotted riding the rails since, taking selfies with and chatting up his fellow passengers.\n\nOn Friday, the vibe was about the same, as Biden — seated in the third row of the tiny first class cabin on the commuter jet — boarded the flight ahead of other passengers, along with his detail, members of which were spread throughout the plane.\n\n“God bless you, sir,” one woman said, as she filed past Biden in his window seat, newspaper in his lap.\n\n“Thank you for your service,” a man said, shaking Biden's hand.\n\nThe woman who took the aisle seat next to the former president first set down her coffee on the arm rest they shared, deposited a bag in the overhead compartment, then sat down and realized her seatmate was the nation's 46th president.\n\nBiden set his hand on her cup to steady it, then met her gaze with a hello as she took her seat.\n\n“I feel like I'm about to cry,” the woman said, as they shook hands and, over the course of the next hour, chatted throughout the flight.\n\nFormer presidents and their spouses receive lifelong Secret Service protection under federal law, but there are no provisions guaranteeing the elite levels of private travel that were necessary features of their time in office.\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at http://x.com/MegKinnardAP.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Oura Ring User Should Know",
    "description": "This low-maintenance wearable has tons of hidden features.",
    "fullText": "I’ve been tracking my sleep and recovery with the Oura ring for nearly five years now, and today I’ll share with you several of my favorite and most-overlooked features—including one feature you should turn off, and one feature you can use even if your subscription is expired.\n\nThe Oura ring uses significantly more battery with blood oxygen sensing turned on. It may make sense to use this feature if you have a specific health concern, but most of us don’t need it on a daily basis.\n\nYou’ll find Blood Oxygen Sensing under the hamburger menu, and can turn it off from there. You’ll lose the “average blood oxygen” and “breathing regularity” metrics, but you’ll gain an extra day or so of battery life.\n\nI’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: the Oura ring is not a great workout tracker. Wearing the ring interferes with weightlifting workouts and it doesn’t have enough precision to seriously track other workouts like running.\n\nOura is a great companion to other workout apps, though. If you track workouts with another device or even with a phone app like Apple’s Fitness app, you can make sure those workouts get synced properly so they show up in your Oura timeline. Go to Settings, and then to Apple Health (iPhone) or Health Connect (Android). Turn on those integrations from there.\n\nAside from synced workouts, Oura will automatically detect workouts it thinks you’re doing. You’ll then see a card asking you to label the workout. Don’t just ignore those cards—Oura learns from your tags.\n\nSo if you went for a walk, make sure that activity is tagged as a walk. But sometimes it will tag another activity as a workout when it actually wasn’t. I’ve seen hair brushing and yarn winding tagged as various forms of exercise. Take a look at the time the activity was logged, and think back to what you were actually doing at the time. (You can dismiss the activity if it wasn’t a workout or isn’t something you care to track.)\n\nThe Oura ring only needs to be charged once or twice a week, but that means it’s hard to get into a routine of charging it regularly. I found that the perfect balance was charging it while I’m at the gym; some people prefer to charge while they’re in the shower.\n\nShort top-ups every few days are ideal for battery health. (Daily charging is arguably too much; only charging when the battery is dead is probably too little.) Oura recommends keeping the battery between 25% and 80% most of the time, if you can.\n\nSo figure out where and when is most convenient to charge, and keep a charger there. That’s why the charging case is convenient—you can carry it in your gym bag, for example. Unfortunately it costs an extra $99 to buy the charging case, but nobody ever said owning an Oura ring is cheap.\n\nThe Trends item in the hamburger menu is one of Oura’s best hidden features. Tap it and you’ll be able to see things that have changed over the past several weeks. For example, as I’m writing this, I can see that my resting heart rate has improved over the past 8 weeks, getting back to my “baseline” after some time in which it was higher than normal.\n\nIf you’ve been diligent about tagging behaviors and lifestyle factors, you can see their effects on your readiness, sleep, activity, or stress. For example, I’m curious whether my mood is better when I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter. Mood isn’t one of the items that Oura tracks, but I can tap Trends and then choose from Stress or Sleep or even Activity (all things that suffer when I’m feeling down) and see whether the days I tagged “vitamins” tend to correlate with higher or lower levels.\n\nMeal tracking was introduced as a companion to glucose tracking, but you don’t need to track your glucose to use the meals feature. Log your meals (you can even snap a picture of your plate) and Oura will give you feedback on how healthy the meal is, and keep track of whether you’re eating on a regular schedule or not. Calorie tracking is not involved. In fact, if you’d rather keep calories out of your Oura app entirely, check out the next item.\n\nOura will give you an activity goal each day, usually a certain number of calories. If you feel your goals are too ambitious (or not ambitious enough), go to the Activity screen and select Edit activity goal. You can choose a different goal, and you can also choose whether you’d like to see this goal in calories or in steps.\n\nIf you want to avoid seeing calories anywhere in the app, there’s a toggle for that. On the same screen, select Calorie opt out. This sets your target to steps and ensures that calorie mentions anywhere else in the app will be hidden. You can also access the calorie opt out from Settings and then Activity.\n\nOura has a Rest Mode setting that is intended for when you’re sick or recovering from an injury. (Oura may even prompt you to turn it on if your data indicates you may not be feeling well.)\n\nBut it’s useful for more than just that. Rest Mode pauses your goals, and stops giving you readiness scores. It’s great for any time you don’t want the app to bother you about what you should be doing. I’ve seen Oura users say they use it for days of their menstrual cycle when they aren’t feeling up to their usual activity; it’s also useful for travel when you know you’ll be stuck in a car or airplane all day, or when your sleep will suffer due to jet lag.\n\nIf you like to beta test new features, check out the Labs item in the hamburger menu. The offerings will change from time to time, but often they are new features in the making. Right now, the only offering I see is a blood pressure profile study, in which Oura is collecting data to hopefully offer blood pressure estimates in the app in the future.\n\nWhen I signed up for this, I had to fill out a questionnaire and sign a research consent. (Not all Oura Labs items are studies, but they can be.) I can see that Oura thinks I probably don’t have hypertension (correct) and that it’s basing that in part on my good resting heart rate and activity level. Other Oura features like meal tracking and Symptom Radar first made their appearances in Labs.\n\nThis is one of Oura’s lesser-known features: a web dashboard where you can view long-term trends, and a “membership hub” where you can download all your data. This spreadsheet download is available even if you don’t have an active subscription, but you do need a subscription for the trend viewer and for all of the software features I mentioned above.\n\nFor the web viewer, go to cloud.ouraring.com. Here, if you click on Trends, you can see all your data—five years’ worth, for me. You can even compare two variables and see a calculation that shows if they’re correlated. My sleep score and total sleep time are highly correlated; my HRV and sleep time are not.\n\nTo download CSV spreadsheets of your data (with or without a subscription), go to the membership hub and sign in. Select Export data and then Request your data. You’ll get a zip file filled with spreadsheets you can analyze to your heart’s content.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon will forbid members of the military from attending Columbia, Yale, Brown and other universities starting next school year amid a campaign to cut ties with institutions that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called “factories of anti-American resentment.”\n\nHegseth announced the policy in a video posted to social media on Friday, three weeks after he said the military was cutting ties with Harvard University. Without citing evidence, Hegseth said the universities have become “breeding grounds of toxic indoctrination” that undermine military values.\n\n“For decades, the Ivy League and similar institutions have gorged themselves on a trust fund of American taxpayer dollars, only to become factories of anti-American resentment and military disdain,” he said. “They’ve replaced the study of victory and pragmatic realism with the promotion of wokeness and weakness.”\n\nHegseth said the ban applies to Columbia, Princeton, Brown, Yale, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and “many others” without elaborating. He called for “complete and immediate cancellation of all Department of War attendance,” though it was not clear how broadly it would be applied.\n\nA message seeking further details was not immediately answered by the Pentagon.\n\nAs of Friday, Columbia, Brown, MIT and Harvard were still listed as eligible institutions in a Pentagon database for its Tuition Assistance program, which covers the full cost of tuition for active-duty personnel. Harvard had 39 participants in 2023, according to the most recent data, while Columbia had nine and MIT had two.\n\nThe earlier action against Harvard aims to block members of the military from attending graduate-level professional military education, fellowships and certificate programs, according to a statement released at the time. There are still questions about whether it applies to programs such as Harvard’s Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program.\n\nHarvard has offered a series of professional development programs and a small number of degree programs tailored to the Pentagon. Last year, it created a new master’s degree in public administration for active-duty military members and veterans. Hegseth earned a master’s degree from Harvard but symbolically returned his diploma in a 2022 Fox News segment.\n\nThe military offers its officers a variety of opportunities to get graduate-level education, both at war colleges run by the military as well as civilian institutions like Harvard.\n\nCampuses across the Ivy League have been a favorite target of President Donald Trump, who accuses them of becoming overrun by “woke” ideology. His administration has cut billions of dollars in research funding and attempted a number of other sanctions against the universities, often as part of investigations into allegations that officials tolerated antisemitism on campus.\n\nHegseth’s announcement is a rebuke to universities that had appeared to have reached a truce with the administration in recent months. Columbia and Brown were among the earliest universities to sign deals with the White House, agreeing to a range of demands in order to have their federal funding restored.\n\nHarvard is fighting back against such demands, alleging in lawsuits that the government is illegally retaliating against the university for rebuffing its ideological views. Last summer, Trump said he was days away from reaching a deal with Harvard, but negotiations appear to have fallen apart. Earlier this month, Trump said Harvard must pay $1 billion to the government as part of any deal, twice what he had previously demanded.\n\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "title": "The New Ultrahuman Ring Pro Has a Surprisingly Feature-Filled Charging Case",
    "description": "Using the charging case for extra features is a genius idea more smart ring companies should consider.",
    "fullText": "Ultrahuman just launched its newest ring, the Ultrahuman Ring Pro. While it’s not yet available in the U.S., I’m excited for this to come to the market. The real game changer here isn’t what’s on the ring, but what Ultrahuman has managed to do with the charging case—that is, a lot more than just charging.\n\nAccording to Ultrahuman, the new ring retails for $429 and has:\n\n15-day battery life—that’s more than RingConn’s battery life and about double Oura’s\n\nA faster processor that Ultrahuman says allows for more accurate data processing\n\nBreak points allowing the ring to be cut apart easily in emergencies\n\nPhysically, the ring looks similar to the Ultrahuman Ring Air, which I’ve previously reviewed. It has a smooth internal surface (no sensor bumps) with a small flat area at the base of the finger.\n\nWhat really intrigues me about this ring is not the ring itself, or even the fact that it has a charging case, but the fact that Ultrahuman is now using the charging case as a device in its own right. I haven’t seen anything like this from other smart ring manufacturers, and it’s a brilliant idea.\n\nFor example, smart rings can’t easily act as an alarm, because then they would need components that can vibrate or make noise—thus adding to the bulk of the ring and reducing battery life. But a charging case can easily act as an alarm clock, especially since you’re likely to have it on your nightstand already. (Ultrahuman’s app has an alarm feature, but it didn’t play well with my iPhone’s silent mode and I didn’t find it reliable.)\n\nThe charging case for the Ultrahuman Ring Pro also has LED indicators, can charge wirelessly, and has a USB-C port. The case has features for diagnostics and troubleshooting, including a button to hard reset the ring if needed. The case can also store up to a year’s worth of ring data and sync it to your phone later.\n\nAnd you know what else I love about the new case? It isn’t sized to the ring. The ring attaches magnetically to the pins on the post, leaving empty space around it if the ring is a large size, and less empty space if it’s a smaller size. If you ever needed to replace the case, you wouldn’t need to find one in your specific size.\n\nLegal action behind the scenes has been messing with the U.S. market for smart rings. About a year ago, there were plenty of options, but then Oura made the case to the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that it believes its smart ring patent covers the design of nearly every smart ring out there. The ITC agreed, and Ultrahuman was one of the companies that needed to pull its rings from the U.S. market.\n\nUltrahuman said almost immediately that it was working on a new ring design anyway, one that is so differently constructed that it can’t possibly run afoul of the ITC ruling. The Ring Pro appears to be the design it was referring to, with Ultrahuman conspicuously referring to its “unibody architecture” rather than using a design with a transparent lining (that transparent lining is one of the features of the patent at issue).\n\nIt seems there is still a possibility that this approach may pay off. A spokesperson told me by email today: “We are working through the necessary steps to bring Ring PRO to our U.S. customers and hope to share good news soon.”",

As Western CEOs double down on productivity, five-day in-office mandates, and AI headcount cuts, more and more young people are looking to Japan for a calm alternative—even vacationing there for a taste of a slower, more intentional way of life that feels worlds away from the corporate grind.\n\n“[While]Trump says, ‘You’re fired,’ in Japan we don’t say, ‘You’re fired,’” a 74-year-old Japanese influencer who goes by @papafromjapan explained on TikTok. “If someone is not doing a good job, we put him near the window, let them do paperwork. Those people we call madogiwazoku.”\n\nA key distinction, he suggests, is that these workers aren’t office troublemakers—they’re often loyal, nonconfrontational workers who’ve simply been overtaken by changing technology or strategy. Rather than push them out, employers quietly move them aside.\n\n“They’re not aggressive people, so we just let them work, and they don’t complain, and they’re happy with it, and they work for the company for a long time.”\n\nProtecting older workers from redundancy—even when their roles shrink—has had a measurable ripple effect on who’s still turning up to work in Japan. The country now has one of the highest rates of senior employment in the developed world, with more than a quarter of people ages 65 and over still working in 2022, compared with less than one in five in the U.S., and barely one in 10 in the U.K.\n\nSurveys show roughly 80% of Japanese workers want to continue working after retirement, with around 70% preferring to stay with their current employer rather than start over somewhere new.\n\nTo make that possible, the government pushed through a revised Law Concerning Stabilization of Employment of Older Persons and a raft of subsidies that nudge companies to secure employment opportunities for workers until the age of 70. The World Economic Forum noted that already some companies are introducing systems that allow employees to extend their retirement age, enabling them to work longer without sacrificing benefits.",

    "fullText": "Mount Westmore, the hip hop supergroup featuring Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, E-40, and Too Short, is currently locked in a messy two-way legal battle over a branding deal that reportedly left a $1.3 million advance in limbo. The drama centers on a 2022 agreement with Westside Merchandising that was supposed to fuel a massive 60-date international tour.\n\nInstead of a global takeover, the group performed exactly three shows before the whole thing went quiet.\n\nNow, a Los Angeles judge has ordered the rap legends to sit for in-person depositions, proving that even industry icons can’t easily duck a subpoena when a million-dollar deal goes south.\n\nThe friction dates back to 2022, when the newly formed collective signed an exclusive deal with Los Angeles-based Westside Merchandising. According to court filings, the partnership was built on an ambitious 60-date run across America and Europe intended to move a mountain of branded gear.\n\nWestside claims it held up its end of the bargain by advancing more than $1.3 million to the artists to kickstart the campaign. However, the company alleges the group played only three concerts in 2022 and none in the years since.\n\nBeyond the missing tour dates, the company claims the artists ghosted them on required promotional videos and retail appearances.\n\nThe legal heat turned up significantly in October 2025 when a Los Angeles Superior Court judge shut down an attempt by Snoop Dogg and Ice Cube to avoid testifying. The rappers' lawyer argued that the deposition demands were \"harassing\" and \"burdensome,\" essentially claiming they had nothing new to say beyond what was already in the paperwork.\n\nThe judge wasn't buying it, calling their \"lack of knowledge\" argument inadequate and pointing out that both Snoop and Cube were actual signatories to the contract.\n\nThis means the icons cannot hide behind their busy schedules or massive brands to avoid being questioned under oath about why the tour evaporated. Westside is even chasing $11,000 in sanctions, accusing the defense of using delay tactics to stall the process.\n\nWhile the \"anchor\" stars of the group are being held to the fire, the other half of the collective is trying a different escape route. E-40 and Too Short have argued in their responses that they were never actually parties to the underlying agreement, even though their names are all over the litigation.\n\nThis creates a fascinating divide within Mount Westmore, as the members navigate their individual levels of liability for the unfulfilled 60-date tour. Westside attorney John Fowler has been blunt about the firm's position, telling TMZ that the case is simple because the other side allegedly defrauded his client. Fowler dismissed the group's recent legal maneuvers as a \"distraction\" that \"reeks of desperation.\"\n\nIn February 2026, the rappers officially flipped the script by filing their own fraud lawsuit against Westside Merchandising, their former business partner. This countersuit alleges that Westside misrepresented its actual retail reach just to lure the group away from a much larger merchandise firm.\n\nThe artists claim that, while they did receive an advance, they are still owed \"hundreds of thousands\" in unpaid revenue from sales that actually occurred. Their filing includes internal accounting figures they say came from Westside, listing about $808,000 in concert merch sales, over $90,000 in retail store sales, and $13,000 in e-commerce sales.\n\nDespite those numbers, the rappers allege they haven't seen a proper accounting of their full share of the profits.\n\nThis move is a classic strategic pivot: the defense is now using Westside’s own financial reporting as a weapon. By highlighting the $808,000 earned during those few 2022 shows, the artists are trying to prove the brand was profitable and that the vendor is the one holding the bag.\n\nTheir legal team has publicly accused Westside of refusing to cooperate or engage in good-faith discussions while calling the original fraud claims \"entirely baseless and without merit.\" It has turned into a classic \"he said, she said\" scenario, with both parties claiming to be the victim of a bait-and-switch.\n\nThe rappers are now seeking unspecified damages, claiming the alleged retail misrepresentations caused them major financial harm.\n\nThe outcome of this battle will likely hinge on whether the court views the failed tour as a deliberate breach or just a consequence of a flawed partnership. Many fans and industry insiders are watching closely to see if those missing 57 tour dates were the result of simple scheduling conflicts or something more legally problematic.\n\nFor now, both the original $1.3 million fraud suit and the new countersuit remain active in the Los Angeles court system with no final judgment in sight.\n\nThis saga is a giant flashing warning sign for the music industry. It highlights a growing tension between legacy artists looking to monetize their brands and the vendors chasing prestige clients. The message is clear: ambitious \"360-style\" deals only work if everyone has the bandwidth to actually show up.\n\nAs the rappers prepare for their in-person depositions, the focus shifts from the music to the fine print. Whether this ends in a settlement or a full trial, the paper trail left by Mount Westmore will be a cautionary tale for any artist thinking about signing on the dotted line for a \"super tour\" that might never happen.",

I was pleased with the game plan and how things unfolded.\"\n\nLeinster head coach Leo Cullen said: \"I thought that Cardiff deserved the win.\n\n\"I am disappointed for our guys, there was lots of good effort and intent but we could get into the game.

    "title": "Formula 1's new golden age of celebrity may have just begun",
    "description": "As the eighth series of Netflix's hugely popular Drive To Survive is released this weekend, has Formula 1 become one big celebrity playground?",
    "fullText": "\"The paddock has now turned into a catwalk,\" says Susie Wolff of the exclusive area at Formula 1 races where teams, the media and guests gather.\n\n\"That's where everyone makes their entrance, from the celebrities, the girlfriends and wives of the drivers.\"\n\nShe's more familiar with the world of F1 than most, as a former professional racing driver, the managing director of female racing series F1 Academy and wife of Toto Wolff, the Mercedes F1 team CEO and principal.\n\nShe feels it's \"one of the few sports that's truly global and there's a glamour to it - it's part of the show and part of the appeal\".\n\nThat glamour has been a staple part of F1 throughout its 76 year history, with precisely engineered cars and luxury brands converging in desirable cities across the world.\n\nBut the sport now seems to be entering a new era of celebrity, fuelled by - and appealing to - a younger crowd; the stars favoured by Gen Z are joining the party.\n\nOne of the major influencers of this apparent changing face of F1 is Drive to Survive, the hugely popular Netflix show which returns for its eighth season this weekend.\n\nF1's new chapter can be traced back to 2017, when US company Liberty Media bought the racing business for $4.4bn (£3.3bn). Taking over the reins from British businessman Bernie Ecclestone after his nearly 40 years in charge, the company set its sights on modernising the sport, with more digital rights, social media promotion and new marketing deals.\n\nA year later, F1 stopped using female promotional models, or grid girls, and commissioned Netflix to make Drive to Survive, a fly-on-the-wall documentary series designed to give unfiltered access to drivers, their teams and the people who run them.\n\nThere was a clear mission to bring in new fans. In a sign of the impact, F1's own statistics show 43% of its overall fanbase is now aged under 35, up by 30% since 2018. YouGov research in 2023 said the latest Drive to Survive series had been watched by seven million people, with 18-29-year-olds making up 31% of the audience.\n\nWith the sport steering in a more candid direction, Wolff says \"the teams have realised it's more than just about the racing, it's the drama off track, the personalities off track\".\n\nAnd with plenty of marketing and PR opportunities from being seen at these events, an all-access pass to an F1 race weekend has quickly become the hottest ticket in town for any big-name celebrity.\n\nOpen the history annuls and you'll find celebrities and WAGs - the wives and girlfriends of drivers - visible in the paddock for decades. Think Nicole Schwerzinger in the late 2000s and early 2010s when she was associated with Lewis Hamilton. And more recently, ex-Spice Girl Geri Horner, the wife of the former F1 Red Bull team principal Christian Horner. Even back in the 1970s, the lives of drivers away from the sport were of widespread intrigue in the media, notably James Hunt.\n\nBut the 2025 season attracted some of F1's biggest names to races to date - with an arguably younger and more global appeal. Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Jennifer Lopez, Timothée Chalamet and Rosé and Lisa from BLACKPINK, to name a few.\n\nIn the new series of Drive to Survive, there are frequent shots of drivers' partners, such as Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc's fiancée Alexandra Saint Mleux, or Williams driver Carlos Sainz's model girlfriend Rebecca Donaldson in high fashion outfits.\n\nMatt Elisofon, co-host of the F1-focused Red Flags Podcast, tells the BBC \"there were more British celebrities in the Ecclestone era\". He references a famously chaotic interaction between late British rocker Ozzy Osbourne and F1 reporter Martin Brundle on a live TV grid walk at a race in 2003. Nowadays, you're more likely to see the likes of American actor \"Will Smith in Abu Dhabi\", Elisofon says.\n\n\"It's just taking on a whole new dimension that's a lot more global, a lot more Hollywood, Travis Kelce, Taylor Swift's fiancé is investing, Patrick Mahomes is investing [in the Alpine F1 team] which is relatively new,\" he adds.\n\nAs a new season rolls around, some fans have been speculating about whether Kim Kardashian will attend any races, after she was spotted at the Super Bowl earlier this month sitting alongside Ferrari driver Hamilton - himself long a trailblazer in F1 for unorthodox fashion looks and celebrity.\n\n\"I'm all about her being in the paddock,\" says Brian Muller, the other half of The Red Flags Podcast.\n\n\"So if Kim Kardashian brings her audience's attention to it - if 2% of her 400m followers say 'Oh, this is cool', that's how you continue to grow this thing and make it as global and powerful as possible.\"\n\nMuller, who is based in the US - where there are now said to be 52 million F1 fans - adds that \"F1 is still trying to find its footing\" there.\n\n\"A lot of my friends don't necessarily know what's going on, but when Beyoncé was in the paddock, I had friends who know that I do the podcast sending me that.\"\n\nMeanwhile, \"the WAG culture is only getting more powerful, it's only just started in terms of the agency that they have in making their own brand and finding a new way in,\" he says.\n\nThe pair refer to the increased celebrity presence at events as a \"gateway\" to entice casual viewers to commit fully to the sport. The YouGov survey from 2023 said 26% of Drive to Survive fans had no interest in Formula 1 itself.\n\nFor Wolff, celebrities attending races is \"brilliant for the sport\" - but there must be a serious side too.\n\nWolff's view is \"it doesn't matter which celebrity is in your garage\" during the race, when \"performance\" comes first.\n\n\"It's about balancing the two, having that sporting integrity.\"\n\nWhat many didn't predict was how popular the sport would become with women.\n\nBella James, an F1 content creator on Instagram and TikTok, feels the Netflix show has connected fans to drivers, making people care more about race results - but has also \"allowed women the same access men had\".\n\n\"It opened up the sport, there's car on track stuff but also personalities, fashions and brands,\" she says.\n\nWolff says she feels \"lucky\" to be involved in the sport at a time when, according to F1, 42% of fans are women, with the fastest growing demographic being in the 18-24-year-old age bracket.\n\nIn the past she says the sport was seen as \"very macho and very male dominated with big egos\", but, as she sees in the female-only F1 Academy series, \"society's changed... You can be feminine, you can be beautiful, and you can put your helmet on and be a fierce-faced driver\".\n\nThere's no doubt last year's F1 Movie, which became actor Brad Pitt's highest grossing film of all time, has also helped motorsport grow in popularity.\n\nFans are now looking ahead to the 2026 F1 race calendar which kicks off in Melbourne, Australia on 6 March - and many will be hoping for a repeat of drama like in 2021.\n\n\"The huge rivalry of Max [Verstappen] and Lewis [Hamilton] going for the title,\" as Wolff puts it.\n\nMillions watched that year as the title decider controversially went down to the final lap of the last race of the season in Abu Dhabi.\n\n\"What happened in Abu Dhabi, everyone in the world knew something had happened there - whether they were into F1 or not,\" says Wolff. \"Those were events that really helped open the sport up to a new audience.\"\n\nIn common with other moments in the Netflix hit before and since, when the showdown was dramatically retold three months later in the fourth season of Drive to Survive, yet another new generation of motorsport fans was born.",

Both had been winless, pointless and hit by injuries.\n\nCaptain Alex Mellor became the latest Tiger to be sidelined after he broke his leg in last week's defeat at Toulouse, while Giants were without a host of injured regulars themselves, including Liam Sutcliff, Joe Greenwood and Harry Rushton because of lengthy lay-offs.\n\nFrance international Tanguy Zenon started for injury-hit Huddersfield just two days after joining the club, while there were Tigers debuts for Wigan loanee George Hirst and former Giants pair Jack Ashworth and Golding.\n\nHood gave the hosts the ideal start, darting from dummy-half to grab his second try of the season after Joe Stimson was brought down close to the line.\n\nCastleford got a deserved second through McIntosh, who scrambled through a frazzled Giants defence that had been pinned back on their line after Taane Milne gave away a reckless penalty for his high hit on Krystian Mapapalangi.\n\nMilne was in the sin-bin when Lawler crashed over under the posts for Castleford's third try in the 26th minute, but after that it was Huddersfield who finished the half stronger, with Zenon denied by a try-saving tackle from Mikaele Ravalawa before Gagai eventually responded with a 38th-minute score.\n\nHuddersfield continued to threaten but were wasteful in search of a way back into the game before Weaver got on the end of a brilliantly weighted grubber kick from Daejarn Asi to edge Castleford 18 points ahead.\n\nFlanagan gave Giants renewed hope when he hit back soon after, but a second from Weaver put the result beyond doubt before Golding crashed over to spark wild celebrations.\n\nCastleford Tigers head coach Ryan Carr told BBC Radio Leeds:\n\n\"That's what we play for, we play to win and play for this feeling right now.\n\n\"I'm really happy for my team and really happy for everyone involved in our club because a lot of work has gone into getting to this point. And there will continue to be a lot more work.\n\n\"But to be able to see them with a smile on their faces, with all the hard work they have done since day one of pre-season, is enjoyable.\n\n\"But it is one win, we have to keep making sure we perform consistently every week now.\"\n\nHuddersfield Giants head coach Luke Robinson told BBC Radio Leeds:\n\n\"I thought we were rubbish, as plain and simple as that.\n\n\"We just robbed ourselves of energy with the amont of dropped balls that we had in that first half. The lads tried hard, but they were exhausted.\n\n\"I think they completed 100% [of their sets] in the second half, and we completed around 60-odd. If you just give the opposition the ball over and over again, you are going to get the same result.\n\n\"Eventually it just robs you of energy and you are basically playing on fumes.\n\n\"Look, they are running around, scrambling and trying their hardest but eventually it just comes back to bite you. We just need to learn and need to learn quick.\"\n\nCastleford Tigers: Cini, Ravalawa, Mapapalangi, McIntosh, Qaraqare, Asi, Weaver, Atoni, Hood, Westerman, Lane, Hirst, Stimson.\n\nReplacements: Lawler, Ashworth, Hall, Golding.\n\nHuddersfield Giants: Patolo, Woolford, Rogers, O'Donnell, Billington, Powell, Russell, Lolohea, Halsall, Milne, Gagai, Zenon, Flanagan.\n\nReplacements: Burgess, King, Rush, English.",

    "fullText": "ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Their family spent years opposing Venezuela’s socialist system.\n\nThe government retaliated by sending men to beat the father, a state oil company worker whom it accused of being uncooperative. Other relatives were threatened.\n\nThe situation became so untenable that the family fled the country for the United States in 2021 after it obtained refugee status, according to one of the daughters, a 24-year-old clothing salesperson who was interviewed by The Associated Press.\n\nThe six siblings and their parents settled in Minnesota in 2023, living peaceful lives until the Trump administration said it was casting new scrutiny on refugees. One priority is those admitted to the U.S. under former President Joe Biden, whom the government accuses of prioritizing quantity over detailed screening and vetting, with an initial focus on 5,600 refugees who settled in Minnesota and are not yet permanent residents, making them particularly vulnerable.\n\nLast month, three masked officers got out of a black SUV with tinted windows outside a St. Paul apartment complex, handcuffed the Venezuelan woman and her mother and told them their legal status was under review, according to the woman, who asked for anonymity for fear of retaliation.\n\nOverturning years of precedent, immigration authorities have arrested or questioned dozens of refugees in Minnesota, attorneys and advocates say, with more detentions likely to come nationwide.\n\nIn January, a federal judge ordered a temporary halt to the arrest and detention of refugees in Minnesota while a lawsuit challenging the “revetting” continues. The judge ordered the immediate release of all refugees detained in Minnesota, and those taken to Texas. On Friday, the judge extended the order protecting refugees in Minnesota from detention, saying the Trump administration policy turns the “American Dream into a dystopian nightmare.”\n\nA group of refugees in other states on Friday also filed a lawsuit seeking to block new DHS policies that could lead to the detention of tens of thousands of refugees who are lawfully in the U.S. but have not yet received permanent residency.\n\nThree refugees told The Associated Press that whatever happens, the rounds of inconclusive interviews with immigration authorities well after they thought their status was safe has them questioning their futures in the U.S. and living in constant fear.\n\nThe young woman from Venezuela hasn't returned to her job at a clothing factory. A man who fled persecution in Myanmar won’t walk on the streets of Minneapolis without a letter from his church appealing for immigrants to “be treated humanely.” A Congolese refugee arrested in St. Paul despite her refugee status says “everything that’s happened feels like a movie.”\n\nWelcoming refugees has been a source of bipartisan agreement in the U.S. since Congress passed the Refugee Act with overwhelming support in 1980.\n\nThe act helped make refugee applications some of the immigration system's most heavily scrutinized. Government decisions that someone was persecuted for who they are or what they believe are rarely second-guessed, and revisiting refugee status that's already been granted is a major blow to legal tradition, advocates say.\n\n“They’ve been heavily vetted and were admitted by the government with approval,” said Beth Oppenheim, chief executive officer of HIAS, a major refugee aid group.\n\nOnce a refugee is admitted to the U.S. through the resettlement program, the only way to strip them of their status is to prove that they should never have been admitted, Oppenheim said. That is why the Trump administration is interviewing people again, she said.\n\nMatthew Tragesser, a spokesman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said in a written statement refugees “are REQUIRED to be subject to a full inspection after a year within the United States.”\n\n“This is not novel or discretionary; it is a clear requirement in law,” he wrote.\n\nWhile it is correct that refugees must apply for green cards one year after admission — a change of status that brings a renewed layer of scrutiny — the administration is breaking with decades of tradition by revisiting initial decisions to admit people as refugees, and then detaining them while they are under review.\n\n“Arresting, detaining, and rescreening refugees are all new changes which will inflict grave harm on vulnerable populations,” said Smita Dazzo, deputy director of U.S. programs at HIAS.\n\nIn January, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement took the Venezuelan women to Houston on a flight where migrants were shackled at the wrists and ankles and forbidden from talking. The daughter said she was told she was there for green card interviews and isolated in a cold room with no food, water or anything warm to cover her. She said she refused to sign documents without an attorney present.\n\n“They told us, ‘Your status is worthless. You’re illegal,’” she said. “What we went through is something I wouldn’t wish on anyone … We were supposed to arrive in this country with refugee status, and we thought we would be protected here. But right now, at this moment, it is quite the opposite.”\n\nThe women were released after successfully filing habeas corpus petitions in federal court, part of a flood of last-ditch attempts at freedom under a Trump policy denying bond hearings in immigration court. Friends of their attorney drove them back to Minnesota at their own expense. Since then, the younger woman has been too afraid to leave the house.\n\nSaw Ba Mya James, a 46-year-old ethnic Karen father of three who fled military persecution in Myanmar, arrived in St. Paul last year after obtaining refugee status with help from a local church.\n\nDespite a pending green card application, the Anglican pastor did not attend church for weeks after friends advised him to avoid going outside.\n\n“I was told to stay at home, so I listened, and I prayed to God with my family,” James said.\n\nJames received a letter Feb. 2 ordering a “post-admissions refugee reverification” at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services St. Paul field office, according to a copy reviewed by The Associated Press.\n\nDuring an interview that lasted several hours, an officer pressed James with questions he said he already addressed extensively before being admitted to the U.S. The officer said the review was needed because an inexperienced employee handled James' initial vetting.\n\nWithin two weeks of the interview, James got another letter asking that he and his family provide fingerprints, which his attorney took as a positive sign.\n\nStill, James remains wary of being detained. He faithfully carries his church sponsors' letter appealing for him and other immigrants to “be treated humanely as fellow image-bearers of God.”\n\nA Congolese woman settled in the Twin Cities area in November 2024 with refugee status, working in the hospitality business as the breadwinner for her husband and four children.\n\nShe said an immigration officer approached her parked car when she arrived for work at 7 a.m. on Jan. 14 in St. Paul, saying he knew her name and that she was a refugee. After telling her to exit the vehicle to answer questions, he handcuffed her despite her efforts to show a work authorization document and identification.\n\nThe woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she fears reprisals, was flown to Houston to be questioned in detail about her experiences in the Congo, Uganda and the United States. She and other refugees refused to sign documents to be sent back to their home countries. She was released Jan. 18 without any ID documents to book a flight to Minneapolis. A manager at her company flew to Houston and drove her 17 hours back home.\n\n“If I told you I’m feeling OK, I’d be lying to you,” she said.",

The ball was spun wide to Bradbury and the big number eight did well to collect the pass and power his way through to the line.\n\nRoss Thompson converted to level things up and Edinburgh were soon in the lead for the first time.\n\nGoosen did brilliantly to ride a couple of tackles and link up with Lang, who sent Vellacott scampering away for his second try of the evening.\n\nEdinburgh were on top, but their momentum was checked when Paterson was sent to the sin-bin for a deliberate knock-on.\n\nScarlets wasted little time in making their numerical advantage count, slinging the ball wide for Roberts to force himself over for his second try to level things up again at 19-19.\n\nPaterson had barely returned to the action when he came up with Edinburgh's fourth try.\n\nThe full-back launched a bomb downfield, Leggatt-Jones made a mess of his return kick to allow Paterson to charge down, gather and go over for the try that sealed the win for Edinburgh.\n\nThe bonus-point victory moves Edinburgh up to 11th in the URC table before Saturday's matches, with Scarlets remaining in 15th.",

    "title": "Unions privately urge Chuck Schumer and Democratic leaders to stay out of Maine's Senate primary",
    "description": "Union leaders in recent days have urged Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N",
    "fullText": "Union leaders in recent days have urged Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to end their support for Gov. Janet Mills in Maine’s Senate primary, pointing to what they see as her weaker record with labor.\n\nUnited Auto Workers President Shawn Fain had a conversation with Schumer this month to discuss the race, among other topics, two people familiar with the call told NBC News. The UAW is supporting Mills’ opponent, Democrat Graham Platner, while Schumer and the DSCC are supporting Mills.\n\nA person familiar with the call said Fain discussed with Schumer what he views as the “shortcomings” in Democratic leaders’ approach to the 2026 midterms, “particularly their failure to adequately listen to working-class voters.” Fain cited the Maine contest as an example, this person said.\n\nSeparately, on Monday, Michael Monahan, international vice president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers’ 2nd District, which includes Maine, sent a letter to DSCC leadership, obtained by NBC News, “to express our deep concern regarding the DSCC’s ongoing involvement in the 2026 Maine Democratic Senate Primary.”\n\n“We strongly urge the DSCC to refrain from intervening further in this primary,” Monahan wrote, adding, “Your committee’s support for Janet Mills is troubling to our membership for several reasons.”\n\nMonahan called Mills’ record with labor unions “fraught.” He pointed to public polling showing Platner leading Mills and argued that money spent against Platner could weaken him for the general election against Republican Sen. Susan Collins.\n\nThe Maine race is perhaps Democrats’ best opportunity to flip a Republican-held Senate seat this fall, and it’s a must-win for them to have any chance of taking over the chamber. While the national Democratic establishment has thrown its support behind Mills, labor’s push highlights some of the base’s discontent with that decision — and the resiliency of Platner, who has weathered controversies.\n\nPlatner announced his candidacy in August, and Mills jumped in two months later, sparking a primary that embodies Democrats’ generational and ideological divides.\n\nA University of New Hampshire poll conducted in mid-February found Platner with a 38-point lead over Mills among likely Democratic primary voters, well beyond the survey’s margin of error. The Mills campaign disputed the survey in a memo, pointing to other recent misses the survey had in Maine and arguing that the sample, which skewed much younger than past Maine electorates, did not accurately reflect the state.\n\nThe June 9 primary is competitive even as Platner faced some blowback over a series of damaging revelations early in his campaign.\n\nLast year, Platner, an oyster farmer and military veteran, apologized for a string of offensive comments he made in past Reddit posts and covered up a tattoo on his chest that has a Nazi association — one he said he was unaware of when he got the tattoo. On Thursday, Platner was pressed at length on a podcast about his explanation for the tattoo.\n\nBut Platner and his energetic campaign have rallied more union support. He has also been endorsed by Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I.\n\nPlatner’s union backers include the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. David Sullivan, the union’s general vice president of the eastern territory, told NBC News he is set to have a Zoom call with the DSCC to discuss the race next week. He said his membership was upset about Democratic leaders’ backing Mills after his union had endorsed Platner.\n\n“So I called my people in D.C. and said, ‘Schumer needs to stay out of Maine,’” Sullivan said, adding: “They said they were going to stick by their guns and they were going to put millions of dollars in for Janet Mills. … We’re going to fight this all the way.”\n\nMills’ campaign highlighted a number of pro-labor efforts she has supported in recent years, including increasing the minimum wage, boosting worker-safety standards and prohibiting employers from retaliating or discriminating against workers who reported them for violating labor laws. The Mills campaign also pointed to a 2022 endorsement from the Maine AFL-CIO and a supportive statement from Monahan about a bill she vetoed in 2021.\n\n“Governor Mills’ record of fighting for workers’ rights, dignity, and pay has earned her praise from many unions throughout the state of Maine,” Tommy Garcia, a Mills spokesperson, said in a statement. “She has made clear she will continue fighting for working people in the Senate to lower costs, protect jobs, and improve our economy — and given she is the only candidate in this race who has negotiated and signed legislation that delivers real progress, Maine voters know she will continue to deliver for them.”\n\nThe Platner campaign declined to comment.\n\nMills has had some clashes with organized labor during her time as governor. In 2019 and 2021, she vetoed labor-backed measures aimed at strengthening the power of a third party’s rulings in disputes over public-sector workers’ wages, insurance and retirement. The measure remains a priority for the Maine AFL-CIO.\n\nIn her 2021 veto letter, Mills wrote the bill would delegate “the power of the purse to unelected officials, no matter how those individuals are selected.”\n\nSullivan described labor’s relationship with Mills as “adversarial.”\n\n“So Janet Mills is not somebody we will support,” he said. “And if, for some odd reason, she ends up going off some miracle win against Graham Platner, you’ll probably see a lot of unions supporting Collins.”\n\nThe UAW, which represents around 2,000 workers in Maine, endorsed Platner the day after Mills launched her campaign in October.\n\nFain said in an October statement announcing the endorsement that Platner is “focused on the real problems facing workers across this country — not the distractions the billionaire class uses to divide us. His campaign is rooted in the same core issues our union fights for every day: a living wage, affordable health care, retirement security, and time outside of work to actually live our lives.”\n\nPlatner also has endorsements from the Maine affiliate of National Nurses United and the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers.\n\nIn an interview, Monahan of the IBEW said he was drawn to Platner’s “impressive” backstory.\n\n“He’s an impressive person, kind of a [former Sen. Joe] Manchin, [Sen. John] Fetterman type, in that kind of category,” Monahan said, referring to Democrats from West Virginia and Pennsylvania who tacked to the center and frequently butted heads with the party’s base. “The numbers I keep seeing out of it, I mean, this isn’t just his polls. The guy’s kicking ass.”\n\nSchumer and the DSCC did not respond to requests for comment. They touted Mills as a strong recruit when she launched her campaign back in October. Mills told NBC News at the time that she met with Schumer once, several months before she launched her campaign, and that he encouraged her to run for the Senate.\n\nThe DSCC has since backed Mills’ candidacy, signing on to a joint fundraising committee with Mills’ campaign to help boost her fundraising. In a memo outlining “multiple paths” to the Senate majority released last month, the DSCC touted Mills and made no mention of Platner.\n\n“Janet Mills happens to have such a strong record, not only as the only Democrat who’s won in 20 years in Maine, but she has a record of fighting for Mainers, understanding their issues,” the DSCC’s chairwoman, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, told NBC News in January. “She stood up to President Trump, she sued him in court and won. So she uniquely, I think, has the grit and the chops to really take on Susan Collins and win. And so that’s why we are so supportive of Gov. Mills.”\n\nAsked whether the Maine Senate race would still be winnable if Platner is the nominee, Gillibrand said, “I’m confident we will have the best nominee, and I’m confident that we will win.”\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "fullText": "How long is it since England made you feel like that?\n\nA win against one of the world's best teams. A win dragged back from the brink.\n\nWill Jacks and Rehan Ahmed, two 20-somethings bursting with talent, arm in arm in the middle of the pitch as smiles beamed from the sidelines.\n\nIt was England how they used to be.\n\nJacks & Ahmed carry England to another thrilling win\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup semi-finals?\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nJacks and Ahmed were two of the first kids of Bazball.\n\nBoth made their Test debuts on the 2022 tour of Pakistan, when Ben Stokes' side were riding the crest of a wave.\n\nJacks took six wickets in his first match, Ahmed five as he became the youngest man to play Test cricket for England.\n\nThree and a half years on in Colombo, the same pair crashed England to a T20 World Cup win over New Zealand that gives them a similar feeling of momentum.\n\nBack then, Ahmed pipped Harry Brook to win a six-hitting contest among the Test squad in Pakistan and was England's first nighthawk during his debut in Karachi.\n\nHere he emerged to bat with England needing 43 runs from 19 balls and hit his second ball high over long-on for six to reignite a chase.\n\nJacks struck Glenn Phillips for a six of his own and followed with two fours, before Ahmed effectively sealed the deal by hitting Mitchell Santner over the rope at long-off.\n\nFrom staring at a momentum-busting defeat, England had a fifth successive win to take with them going forward.\n\n\"Baz actually sent one of the walkie talkie messages downstairs, saying 'tell Reh to bat like Sehwag',\" Ahmed explained - a reference to India's aggressive former opener Virender Sehwag.\n\nIt is a long time since it felt that simple. Those words could not be any more 2022.\n\nThe excitable spark Ahmed and Jacks provided has been lost by England at some point over recent months.\n\n\"Weak men\" in Australia. Noosa. A team's entire identity being pulled apart.\n\nSomething here at the World Cup feels more like a flashback to the times of old.\n\nMcCullum appears suited to helping build something with a talented, sometimes inspirational, captain. That is a place England have certainly been in before.\n\n\"This group is the era of Harry Brook as white-ball captain,\" Jacks said.\n\n\"He has got us to play a certain way and the environment around the group is absolutely brilliant.\n\n\"Hopefully everyone can see we are having fun and are approaching the game in the right way.\"\n\nThis was England's best win since the third Test against India last summer – the week of Jofra Archer's return in whites, Rishabh Pant's cartwheeling off stump, and Shoaib Bashir's charging towards the Lord's grandstand with a bandaged finger. How long ago does that feel?\n\nMost significantly, England are finding ways to win here after their winter of discontent – a hallmark of McCullum's first year in charge.\n\nIn those early days, they shipped 553 runs but still beat New Zealand in a whirlwind of Jonny Bairstow.\n\nThere was the chase of 378 against India, and the win on the flattest pitch Rawalpindi had ever seen.\n\nAt this World Cup, they have scrambled an escape against Nepal, scraped past Scotland and Italy when the walls threatened to crumble in, and beat Sri Lanka with one of the great one-man shows.\n\nIt is a welcome change for a side that squandered any chances they did create in Australia.\n\n\"If you can get yourself out of some tricky positions and end up winning games it does wonders for your confidence,\" Jacks said.\n\n\"There's no better team than one that fights and finds a way of winning.\"\n\nThis is not to say England have been perfect by any means – nor that everything that has come this winter is forgotten.\n\nThere remains no certainty that McCullum will be in charge come the summer, even after this run to the last four.\n\nThe Test victory in Hyderabad last year, which was followed by four heavy defeats, also shows one should never get too carried away.\n\nAnd Harry Brook's men now leave Sri Lanka - a country that has provided a sanctuary for over the past weeks and returned six T20 wins from six - for India and the semi-finals.\n\nThere they could meet the co-hosts or West Indies or South Africa - this tournament's three most-feared teams. There are only so many times you can go back to the well.\n\n\"Everyone knows about India and the storyline that brings,\" Jacks said.\n\n\"It could also be West Indies and they have beaten us in Mumbai.\n\n\"We know how tricky that will be. We will watching that game on Sunday. We will be prepared. We go in with optimism.\"\n\nIt is that optimism that has been drained over the recent months. For many it will, quite rightly, take months to come back.\n\nJacks, though, spoke with a glint in his eye – the look of a side starting to believe in themselves again - and dismissed concerns over the lack of straightforward wins.\n\n\"We've won six out of seven games and we've qualified for a semi-final,\" he said.\n\n\"At the end of the day, no-one really cares. We obviously want to play well in them but we're not gutted we haven't played a perfect game.\n\n\"What we've done well is the key moments - we've kept a calm and clear head and we've managed to get those rewards.\"\n\nFor now it is working. It is a welcome flash back to the good times.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

We are going to get back to our good run of wins.\n\n\"We set our standards high and we have the ability to win every game.

    "fullText": "Oleksandr Usyk will return to the ring in May when he defends his WBC heavyweight title against former kickboxing champion Rico Verhoeven at the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt.\n\nTwo-time undisputed heavyweight champion Usyk, who holds the WBA, WBC and IBF belts, has not fought since stopping Daniel Dubois at Wembley Stadium in July.\n\nIn a bout organisers have dubbed the 'Glory in Giza', 36-year-old Dutch heavyweight Verhoeven will be boxing for the first time since 2014 when he faces Usyk on 23 May.\n\n\"I truly respect people who reach the very top in their sport,\" said Usyk, who is unbeaten across his 24 professional bouts.\n\n\"Rico is one of them - a powerful athlete and a great champion.\n\n\"Being a champion isn't just about belts. It's about years of hard work, discipline and belief.\n\n\"I respect his journey - he's truly the King of Kickboxing. But this is boxing - a different game, with its own rules and its own kings.\n\nVerhoeven had 76 fights and 66 wins in his kickboxing career before announcing his departure from the sport in November.\n\n\"I spent 12 years as the undisputed heavyweight kickboxing champion and accomplished everything I set out to accomplish. But staying at the top for that long didn't take away the hunger, it strengthened it,\" said Verhoeven.\n\n\"I wasn't looking for comfort, so I started looking for the highest challenge available in another world.\n\n\"Usyk is undisputed in boxing. That's the kind of challenge that motivates me. Undisputed versus undisputed. The best facing the best.\"\n\nThis is a world heavyweight title fight in the shadow of one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World - a backdrop so spectacular it almost distracts from how extraordinary, and frankly bizarre, the contest itself is.\n\nDetails of the fight's location are light, other than that it will be \"under the shadow of ancient giants\".\n\nBut no matter the location, this will be a mammoth mismatch. And that is not said lightly during a time that has already given us Anthony Joshua v Jake Paul. At least that was framed as spectacle. This is for the WBC heavyweight title.\n\nVerhoeven had been loosely linked with a bout against Joshua before the Briton's car crash in December. But there is a vast difference between a crossover curiosity and a sanctioned world-title challenge against a pound-for-pound great.\n\nUsyk may be running out of credible dance partners, which perhaps explains it. But the heavyweight cupboard is not bare. He vacated his WBO title rather than face Fabio Wardley, while Agit Kabayel's name has been repeatedly mentioned by fans craving a live, unbeaten contender with momentum. Instead, we are handed a boxing novice.\n\nTyson Fury was dropped and pushed to the brink by boxing debutant Francis Ngannou in 2023, who came close to one of the biggest upsets in heavyweight history. So anything can happen in the ring, of course, but someone as methodical and disciplined as Usyk is unlikely to repeat Fury's errors.\n\nEven in this current era of boxing, where hype and profit can outweigh logic, this sits high on the \"how did we get here?\" list.\n\nUsyk targeting 2026 return but rules out Itauma\n\nWardley to be world champion as Usyk gives up belt\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",
