    "description": "Ahead of facing Liverpool, we spoke to fan writer Ben Pescod to find out what’s going wrong for Arne Slot currently.",
    "fullText": "It seems crazy to suggest after winning the title last season, but with one win in eight, is pressure really starting to mount on Arne Slot again?\n\nIt’s a bit of an uncomfortable conversation. Slot done a brilliant job to win the league last season, especially taking over from Jurgen Klopp. He’s also had to deal with devastating circumstances that you just can never prepare for and he navigated that extremely well. However, strictly talking football, it’s nowhere near good enough. 24 points from the last 20 league games is a dreadful return. His saving grace has been the form in Europe, but one league win in 2026 is impossible to defend. Xabi Alonso’s departure from Real Madrid hasn’t helped the situation and now with Man United and Chelsea finding form, hopes of Champions League football are fading.\n\nAfter being so dominant last season, what would you say are the key factors behind Liverpool’s drop in form?\n\nLast season we were truly brilliant and were comfortably the best team in the league. This year, it feels like the entire league has leaned towards a more direct and physical style of play and we have gone the complete other direction. We’re soft and weak as a squad and one of the easiest teams to play through in the entire league. Age has finally caught up with Mo Salah, which is sad to see but was bound to happen eventually. Perhaps our struggles has really reinforced just how brilliant he was last season.\n\nOne of Liverpool’s key troubles is on the road, with just two away wins since mid-September – what issues are you facing away from Anfield?\n\nWe can’t deal with the pace and physicality of a lot of teams. Set pieces have been a massive issue with our set-piece coach recently being sacked. Should teams allow us the ball, we’re relying on a moment of magic from Wirtz or Ekitike. If they’re susceptible on the break, we don’t have the pace or directness to punish sides.\n\nWith Dominik Szoboszlai suspended and Liverpool failing to sign Lutsharel Geertruida, who do you expect to deputise at right-back?\n\nBelieve it or not we do have a natural right-back still available in Calvin Ramsay, but Slot has been quite blunt in his dismissal of him. A return for Joe Gomez would be timely, but he was absent from the squad on Sunday so remains a doubt.\n\nCurtis Jones is the likeliest option to fill in and has had a few good games at right-back in the past. However, he seems to suit that role in games that we control and I can’t imagine that being the case on Wednesday. He’s a really talented footballer, perhaps our most underrated player, but hasn’t been trusted enough this season. Wataru Endo is another option, but I struggle to see Slot opting for that.\n\nLiverpool spent over £400m on Jeremie Frimpong, Florian Wirtz, Milos Kerkez, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak. Who has impressed you most and who has been underwhelming?\n\nIn terms of the new signings, I’m still positive on all of them. Milos Kerkez had a tough start but has really improved in the past month or so.\n\nEkitike and Wirtz are two very special players. Ekitike hit the ground running and is such a fun player to watch. 15 goals and 4 assists already is an incredible return.\n\nThe performances have always been there with Wirtz, but the goal involvements are now starting to really click. With a £116m price tag, it’s almost impossible to forget that, but he’s immensely talented and works harder than you’d perhaps expect.\n\nFrimpong has had injury struggles but has looked good in most of his games, whilst Mamardashvili won’t really be properly judged until he takes over for Alisson Becker.\n\nIn terms of being underwhelmed, you would have to say Alexander Isak. Context of course matters and it took him a while to get anywhere near being fully fit. However, £125m is a massive amount of money and it remains to be seen how he will recover from this serious injury. I’d say he has enough credit in the bank to not be too worried over how good he will become for Liverpool.\n\nIf you were Regis Le Bris, how would you expose Liverpool’s weaknesses?\n\nIf I were Le Bris, the right-back situation is a glaring weakness. I’ve been hugely impressed with the likes of Chemsdine Talbi and I’ve heard great things about Nilson Angulo. Get one of those at the right-back.\n\nBrian Brobbey against Virgil van Dijk and Ibou Konate will be some battle and perhaps the difference maker could be getting someone like Enzo Le Fee right up there with him. Liverpool struggle with second balls and he has the talent to punish that.\n\nAre any players missing, and who do you think will start?\n\nSlot doesn’t have a tone of options to change really. Alisson will stay in goal and VVD and Konate are our only centre/back options at the moment. Kerkez will go again at left-back and then he has a big decision to make at right-back, which I think it’ll be Curtis Jones.\n\nGravenberch and Mac Allister will form the double pivot and try an provide a foundation for Wirtz. If Xhaka is still sidelined, I think Liverpool’s biggest chance of getting a result is exposing that space and getting Wirtz and Ekitike linking up.\n\nSalah and Gakpo are the only real options on both wings, frustratingly.\n\nSunderland are currently unbeaten at the Stadium of Light – what is your prediction for the final score?\n\nMy prediction is Sunderland 1-1 Liverpool. I rate this Sunderland side so highly and I think they’re everything that Arne Slot hates at the moment. Immense physicality, a really strong defence and big quality.\n\nA defeat would be a massive blow and could see us fall seven points behind Chelsea in fifth.\n\nA night match at the Stadium of Light, this will be one of the toughest games of the season.",

    "title": "Milan Cortina: What to watch today in the Winter Olympics — Chloe Kim hits halfpipe as U.S. chases gold in speed skating, ice dance (2/11)",
    "description": "There are several gold medal opportunities for the United States today in Italy.",
    "fullText": "The Winter Games have begun in Italy. From the rink to the slopes, a new generation of stars has emerged to chase gold. We’ll keep you connected to all of the thrilling moments and top stories as we track the medal race each day of the Games.\n\nThe United States is up to seven total medals so far in Italy, and will have several opportunities to add to that count in Day 5 of the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nJordan Stoltz will attempt to continue his dominant run throughout speed skating in the 1,000 meters, and the women's double luge will have its first ever gold medal awarded at the Olympics later Wednesday. Madison Chock and Evan Bates are back in action with their final ice dancing event. Oh, and Chloe Kim will hit the halfpipe for the first time, too.\n\nHere are the top five things to watch on Wednesday at the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics:\n\nIt’s time for Jordan Stoltz to take the ice in Italy. The Team USA speed skating star will open with the 1,000 meters on Wednesday, the event in which he already holds the world record. He made his Olympics debut in Beijing four years ago and finished only 14th in the 1,000 meters, though he’s widely considered a medal favorite every time he takes the ice in these games.\n\nBut the 1,000 meter is his best event. Stoltz has five wins at that distance already this season, and has won 14 races in a row in that distance on the World Cup level. Stoltz will also compete in the 500 meters, 1,500 meters and mass start.\n\nChloe Kim is ready for her first event in Italy. The top name in the sport will open her quest to become the first person to win three straight gold medals in the halfpipe, starting with qualifying Wednesday. Kim was 17 when she won gold in South Korea in 2018, and she backed it up in Beijing four years ago, too. But Kim is now dealing with a torn labrum, which she suffered during training in Switzerland.\n\nIf she can get through qualifying, the final of the women’s halfpipe is set for Thursday.\n\nThe women’s doubles luge was added to the Olympics for the first time this year after more than six decades on the men’s side. It’ll be up to Chevonne Forgan and Sophia Kirkby to lead the way for the United States.\n\nThe duo, who are the only American women’s pairing, won bronze at the first ever world championship back in 2022. They’ve looked good so far, too, with a top five time in five of their six training runs. But it’s Austria’s Selina Egle and Lara Kipp who are the favorites, as they both lead the World Cup standings and have won three training runs so far.\n\nMadison Chock and Evan Bates will enter Wednesday’s ice dance free skate in second place, so they’ll have to rally a bit in order to pull off the gold medal. They trailed France’s Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron by less than half a point after the rhythm dance portion of the competition on Monday.\n\nMadison Chock and Evan Bates with a STELLAR first-place ice dance performance to start off strong for Team USA! 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/kk0O802JTr\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 6, 2026\n\nThe married couple are the reigning world champions in the event, and are just days removed from helping the U.S. win a second straight team gold medal. But the individual medal is the last piece they’ve been chasing after a fourth-place finish in Beijing.\n\nAll eyes will be on Ryan Cochran-Siegle when he hits the Super-G on Wednesday. He was the only American Alpine skier to win a medal at the Beijing Olympics when he won silver in the event four years ago.\n\nBut competition is stiff for Cochran-Siegle to improve on that finish this time around. Switzerland’s Marco Odermatt is the favorite in the event, with already two wins to his name this season. A trio of Austrians have dominated the World Cup season race, too, and Italy’s Giovanni Franzoni is a big name to watch.\n\nHe has his work cut out for him, but he is the only returning medalist from Beijing.

    "fullText": "Super Bowl LX wasn’t the most exciting game ever played, featuring just 12 total points through the first three quarters amid a barrage of punts and field goals. While the scoring finally picked up in the fourth quarter, the Seattle Seahawks coasted to a 29-13 victory over the New England Patriots in a game that was largely drama-free.\n\nEven so, that didn’t stop the game from drawing a record TV audience.\n\nThe game’s TV ratings were released on Tuesday, and the results were somewhat surprising. NBC’s telecast averaged 124.9 million viewers, making it the second-most-watched Super Bowl ever behind last year’s Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles, which averaged 127.7 million viewers on FOX.\n\nSuper Bowl LX Ratings Slip-but Still Draw Massive Audience. \n\nNBC's telecast of Seahawks blowout win over Pats averaged 124.9M viewers, down 2% from record 127.7M for Fox's Eagles-Chiefs last year.\n\nAudience peaked at record 137.8M in 2nd Qtr.https://t.co/79KLpED0AG via @FOS\n\n— Michael McCarthy (@MMcCarthyREV) February 11, 2026\n\nWhile overall viewership was down 2.8 million — a 2% dropoff — the game still set a Super Bowl record for peak viewership. Viewership peaked at an average of 137.8 million viewers in the second quarter from 7:45 p.m. ET to 8 p.m. ET — the highest peak viewership in U.S. TV history.\n\nMost of those viewers also tuned in to Bad Bunny’s halftime show, which drew 128.2 million viewers — the fourth-largest audience for a Super Bowl halftime show. It also shattered NFL social media records.\n\nOverall, the ratings were strong for a game that was a bit light on star power and household names. That shouldn’t be too surprising, though, given that the Patriots had high TV ratings all postseason, setting multiple records along the way.\n\nAmerica may be tired of New England’s success on the gridiron, but it keeps tuning in.\n\nFormer Patriots Quarterback Reveals Sky-High Expectations For Drake Maye",

    "fullText": "Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior has confirmed that key player Marc Cucurella is set for a scan after coming off injured last night.\n\nThe Blues threw away a comfortable 2-0 lead against Leeds United in their latest Premier League match last night, to end up drawing the game 2-2 and also throwing away two vital points in the race for Champions League qualification.\n\nAfter Joao Pedro opened the scoring, which was soon added to by a Cole Palmer penalty, Rosenior and Chelsea were in dreamland cruising the game. They played some superb football in that first half.\n\nPedro was fantastic leading the line again, and he earned some rightful praise from his manager after the game in his post-match interview.\n\nAway from the analysis, Cucurella came off at half time and was replaced with Jorrel Hato.\n\nMarc Cucurella battles for possession against Wolves. (Photo by Dan Istitene/Getty Images)\n\nIn words cited on X after the game, The Blues boss said Cucurella “felt his hamstring” and had to come off at half-time!\n\nRosenior says the Spanish full back will have a scan to see if he’s available for the next game.\n\nObviously we will now be eagerly awaiting the results of this scan because Cucurella is a big player for this team and one of the more experienced players we have, so he has become a vital cog in the Chelsea machine.\n\nThe positive thing here is that Cucurella didn’t go down, or look in any pain, and he walked off normally at half time. So this should hopefully suggest that the injury was not anything too bad or will be too serious.",

    "fullText": "Skyridge continued its Region 3 revenge tour on Tuesday night with another impressive victory.\n\nThe Falcons raced to a 21-point halftime lead at Corner Canyon and then held off a furious second-half push from the home team as they secured the 69-60 victory.\n\nAfter going 0-4 through the first half of region play, Skyridge has suddenly won three straight region games, avenging previous losses to Lehi, Lone Peak and now Corner Canyon.\n\nSkyridge coach Jeff Gardner said there’s been no major changes in recent weeks to flip those losses to wins, but rather the team just kept learning and staying patient.\n\n“You know, I think staying the course more than anything. We knew that we had lost to good teams and we were very competitive in most of those situations, and so it was no panic, stick the course and that was really our mentality,” said Gardner. “We just kept trying to do what we do well better, and just keep our head down and work.”\n\nCombined with a couple of nonregion wins during this recent stretch, Skyridge has won straight and now sits a 14-7 on the season.\n\nRyder Gentry led the way with 21 points, with Carson Mosteller making half of his team’s 10 3-pointers in finishing with 18 points.\n\nSkyridge will try and complete its Region 3 revenge tour this Friday when it hosts American Fork, a team it fell behind by double digits in last month’s meeting and never recovered.\n\nThe opposite game flow unfolded on Tuesday as Skyridge shot 68% in the first half and made eight 3-pointers in rolling to the 43-22 halftime lead over the Chargers.\n\nIt was as good a half of basketball as a team can expect to play in February.\n\n“You know, the first half was one of those where we just played really well, we got baskets in transition and in our half court stuff we just did a good job of cutting hard, moving hard, making good passes and executing what we wanted to execute,” said Gardner.\n\nSkyridge made 8-of-14 3-pointers in that opening half, and nearly half of them were wide-open looks created in the flow of the offense.\n\n“Corner Canyon is such a good defensive team, to do it against them is even more special because you know Coach (Dan) Lunt does just a incredible job with his team on both ends of the floor and so it was awesome,” said Gardner.\n\nAt the half, Gardner stressed to his team that a 21-point lead against a quality team like Corner Canyon was not insurmountable. Sure enough, the cushion started to evaporate pretty quickly in the third.\n\nSkyridge only turned the ball over four times in the first half, but in less than five minutes of the third quarter Corner Canyon’s increased defensive pressure led to four turnovers and quick transition buckets as the lead shrunk to 48-39 with 3:32 left in the quarter.\n\n“They definitely put a little more pressure on us and their length caused some issues getting in some passing lanes,” said Gardner.\n\nHe knew his team needed a push back before the lead complete vanished, and that’s what his experienced squad did. Skyridge outscored Corner Canyon 7-2 to close the quarter to stretch the lead to 55-41.\n\n“I was super proud that we were able to kind of stop the bleeding and keep it there, because if that thing gets back to four going into the fourth quarter, now it’s all bets are off,” said Gardner.\n\nRyder Gentry’s four-point play highlighted the spurt with 48 seconds left in the quarter.\n\nEven though Gardner said a 14-point lead was far from comfortable, it gave his team the extra breathing room it needed in the fourth.\n\nCorner Canyon scored on its first five possessions of the fourth to trim the lead to 60-53 with five minutes remaining.\n\nThe Chargers cut the lead to six points on two different occasions, and even had a good look at a 3-pointer with under 90 seconds remaining to potentially make it a one-score game.\n\nAfter that miss, however, Skyridge took care of the ball and was able seal the win from the free throw line.\n\nThe Falcons did not turn the ball over once in the fourth quarter despite Corner Canyon’s frenetic pace defensively, which allowed them to work some shot clock and get quality shots in the fourth.\n\n“We’ve got a lot of seniors that play that have a lot of experience, a lot of them played last year and that helps, they’ve been there, they didn’t panic,” said Gardner.",

    "fullText": "Devin Booker is still unsure of playing in back-to-back games for the Phoenix Suns originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nDevin Booker and the Phoenix Suns have had an impressive 2025-26 season, as they have a 32-22 record. This is much better compared to their struggles over the past few seasons.\n\nUnfortunately for the Suns, they have dealt with injury issues throughout the season. Jalen Green has been struggling with constant hamstring injuries, and Booker has also been dealing with ankle issues recently.\n\nHead coach Jordan Ott wants to be careful with both Green and Booker after recovering from their injuries. The situation with Green is particularly troubling because they are worried that he could re-aggravate the hamstring again.\n\nBooker returned a bit earlier than expected from his ankle injury, so the Suns want to be careful with his return as well. Since Tuesday's game against the Dallas Mavericks was the first leg of a back-to-back, Booker's presence in the second leg is questionable.\n\nMORE:Devin Booker's ankle injury could be a nightmare for the Phoenix Suns' promising season\n\nOn Wednesday, the Suns will be playing against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Considering it is an important game that will see them go against the defending champions, the Suns would love to have Booker and Green.\n\nHowever, the Suns will only make that choice when the day rolls around. After the Mavericks game, the Suns will give the players some time to recover and find out if they can play.\n\n\"Seeing how it feels, usually the next day is the tough day. For now, just making sure the swelling is a bit down and manageable,\" Booker said after the Suns' win against the Mavericks.\n\nThe Suns are taking the right approach, especially with what happened to Green earlier this season. He was ready to go in November, but after injuring his hamstring again, the Suns have become more careful.\n\nIt will be tough against the Thunder, but they will be ready to compete. With Dillon Brooks playing high-level basketball this season, the Suns will always be a threat.\n\nSuns trade for Cole Anthony, duck under luxury tax\n\nDillon Brooks calls out Joel Embiid's 'flopping' after Suns' loss to the 76ers\n\nDillon Brooks credits his Phoenix Suns teammates for helping him win Player of the Week\n\nCollin Gillespie joins Suns' all-time greats with monster game vs. Trail Blazers\n\nDraymond Green takes another swipe at Dillon Brooks",

    "fullText": "After making a strong start to the 25/26 season, Phil Foden hit the proverbial wall late in December and throughout January. A heavy workload caused Foden to become fatigued, and subsequently his performances weren’t at the high standards that they were at the beginning of this season. Tonight, Manchester City take on Fulham in an important Premier League fixture. The scene at the Etihad could be set for Foden to return to form against an opponent that he played well against in City’s 5-4 win at Craven Cottage at the beginning of December.\n\nPhil Foden hasn’t started any of Manchester City’s past three Premier League matches. Foden’s last start came in Manchester City’s 2-0 defeat to Manchester United. He only played the first half of that match. Since then, Foden has played 29 minutes against Wolves, 2 minutes against Tottenham, and he was an unused substitute against Liverpool (statistics sourced from transfermarkt.com). Foden has had a sustained period of rest that he desperately needed. The hope is that it helps him feel refreshed and can help him get back to the form that he showed earlier this season.\n\nManchester City will be hoping that by giving Phil Foden the rest he needs, he can get back to his best form. Foden at his best remains one of the best players in the Premier League. With City still challenging for honors on four fronts, they need every player to contribute to the cause. Given Foden’s importance to Pep Guardiola’s side, they especially need him back in form for what lies ahead.\n\nWhen Manchester City last played Fulham, City won a pulsating match 5-4 at Craven Cottage. The match didn’t make a whole lot of sense, but Pep Guardiola’s side hung on to claim a valuable three points. On that night in London, Foden bagged a brace. His overall performance was also superb, as he was poised in possession and did everything his team needed to help them win a thriller. Foden has runs on the board against tonight’s opponent, so perhaps tonight’s match at the Etihad is the ideal setting for Foden to bounce back into form.\n\nPhil Foden has now had a sustained period of rest that he so desperately needed. After having the opportunity to rest, it is hoped that we see Foden back to his dazzling best. Tonight’s match could be the ideal setting for Foden to make a big impact for Manchester City. Foden was superb against Fulham in December, and if he starts tonight’s match and can make an impact, it could be a big moment for what lies ahead this season.",

    "fullText": "We cannot fully know the answer. But there is an alternative scenario where Liverpool are merely publicly backing him but behind the scenes perhaps something else is going on.\n\nThe club may already be preparing for his successor.\n\nBut what if that successor is not available right now? What if that successor is only available in the summer so Liverpool have to wait?\n\nThis could be entirely possible. The most perfect candidate to replace Slot might be Julian Nagelsmann, who won't be leaving his role as manager of Germany until the World Cup concludes in North America.\n\nNagelsmann is the ideal fit because he has very similar principles to Jurgen Klopp, just with a more modern hint.\n\nHe is also a young and developing manager with world-class potential. In fact, given his achievements in the game at Bayern Munich, RB Leipzig, FC Hoffenheim and now the German national team, you'd probably already call him world-class.\n\nNagelsmann is only 38-years-old but he already has so much experience for someone of his age. His methods are extremely effective and despite Germany not having a great squad, they will be one of the favourites because of Nagelsmann at the World Cup.\n\nWhat makes the German such an ideal fit is that he comes from the pressing mindset. He was someone who admired Jurgen Klopp's style of play and who always implemented successful gegenpressing systems.\n\nRight now, Liverpool's lack of pressing is a massive issue. Slot just doesn't seem to be able to introduce a press that works effectively. It's all over the place.\n\nNagelsmann has a track-record of doing this at international and club level. He has worked at more teams than Slot and more importantly he has worked with several of the club's current stars, including Dominik Szoboszlai, Ibrahima Konate and Florian Wirtz.\n\nHe's the perfect candidate, and waiting for him might make sense.",

    "fullText": "The Detroit Red Wings are fortunate to boast two of the most highly regarded goaltending prospects in the National Hockey League, and fans hope both will eventually help backstop the franchise to Stanley Cup glory.\n\nSebastian Cossa (15th overall, 2021) and Trey Augustine (41st overall, 2023) each possess sky-high potential and have delivered for their respective teams this season.\n\nWhile Augustine recently tied former Red Wing Bob Essensa for eighth all-time in victories by a Michigan State Spartans goaltender, Cossa has led the way in the crease during what has become a historic campaign for the AHL's Grand Rapids Griffins.\n\nThe Griffins (35-7-2-1) are the best team in the AHL, and the play of Cossa has been a major reason why. He's amassed a sparkling 20-4-2 record while posting a 1.99 goals-against average, a .928 save percentage, and four shutouts.\n\nFor the second consecutive season, he was named an AHL All-Star and took part in Tuesday evening's skills competition.\n\nSebastian Cossa wraps up his night stopping 3/5 in the Breakaway Relay!#AHLAllStar #GoGRG #LGRW pic.twitter.com/Za9DMfII5q\n\n— Hockeytown West Podcast (@HockeytownWpod) February 11, 2026\n\nSebastian Cossa stopped 2/3 in the Pass & Score contest going up against the trio of Laurent Dauphin, Zac Jones, & Patrick Brown!\n\nThis one seems so unfair to the goalies 😂 but Cossa did great!#AHLAllStar #GoGRG #LGRW pic.twitter.com/xgMmCuchsx\n\n— Hockeytown West Podcast (@HockeytownWpod) February 11, 2026\n\nBookmark The Hockey News Detroit Red Wings team site to stay connected to the latest news, game-day coverage, and player features.\n\nCossa, who is eligible to become a restricted free agent at the end of the season, spoke during Training Camp about the importance of performing at his best in a contract year.\n\n\"It’s a contract year for me, so a big year,\" Cossa said in September. \"I had a really good summer, put in a lot of work.

    "description": "Cougars force 13 turnovers and use a smothering defense to take care of the Runnin’ Utes.",
    "fullText": "Three days after Utah faced Kansas on the road at historic Allen Fieldhouse, the Runnin’ Utes were hosting No. 3 Houston at the Huntsman Center on Tuesday night.\n\nTalk about a challenging back-to-back.\n\nUtah had a couple nice little stretches, but ultimately, the Cougars showed exactly why they’re a top-five team.\n\nHouston just doesn’t make too many mistakes, and they force their opponents into a lot, thanks to the tenacious defense the Cougars are known for.\n\n“They do what they do, and they really expose your weakness as a team,” Utah coach Alex Jensen said. “But great crowd tonight, I thought. The student section, they stayed till the end, and I was happy with our guys at the end that kept playing.”\n\nAfter Houston built a 15-point first-half lead, the Utes’ most impressive stretch of the night made it competitive going into the break.\n\nUtah finished the first half on a 7-1 run to end the first half and was down 34-25 at the break.\n\nHouston, though, put the defensive squeeze on to start the second half, and that carried them to the victory.\n\nThe Cougars forced turnovers on Utah’s first three possessions of the second half, and turned each of those takeaways into points.\n\nThat 6-0 spurt over the half’s first two minutes reset the tone for Houston (22-2, 10-1 Big 12), and from there, the Cougars never let the Utes (9-15, 1-10 Big 12) challenge them again.\n\nIt was the sixth straight loss for Utah.\n\nHouston guard Emanuel Sharp had an outstanding night, from his defense to his 3-point shooting.\n\nSharp made 6 of 7 from long range over the game’s first 10 and a half minutes, and he hit two more 3-pointers back-to-back in the second half to push the Cougars’ lead to 48-39.\n\nSharp was the only sharpshooter from 3-point range in the game. Houston as a team was 9 of 26, including 1 of 13 outside of Sharp, while Utah went just 2 of 17.\n\n“A game like tonight, we really focused on rebounding, because that’s where I think they really bury you — they get the ball up, and then they crash two or three guys and just smother you on the boards,” Jensen said.\n\n“He had the six 3s (before halftime), that was the difference in the first half. There were two of them we showed at halftime that were mental errors on our part, not because it was him shooting it, but just we missed an assignment, or we rotated when we didn’t.”\n\nSharp ended up with 27 points and was the only Houston player to finish with double-digit scoring.\n\nHouston coach Kelvin Sampson praised the senior for his toughness, his defensive work and “his heart and attitude” Tuesday night, which included helping shut down Utah’s leading scorer, Terrence Brown.\n\n“His teams win 30 games every year (at Houston),” Sampson said of Sharp. “It’s not because of his 3s. It’s because of his toughness and his defense and the fact that he can not shoot (and be a contributor) is why we recruited him. His heart and his attitude, it brings that out,” Sampson said.\n\nBrown ended up with 12 points, on 3 of 8 shooting, while also hitting 6 of 8 from the free-throw line.\n\nBrown, who is averaging over 21 points per game, didn’t score his first field goal until two minutes remained in the second half, and seven of his points came in the final seven minutes after Utah had fallen behind by as many as 22 points.\n\n“Terrence came up to me in the handshake line, and I tapped him on his chest. I told him to keep fighting, and that’s important for those kids to keep fighting,” Sampon said. “He said, ‘Man, y’all can guard.’ I said, ‘Y’all can, but the guy who guarded you really can.’”\n\nHouston’s suffocating defense was a deterrent for fellow guard Don McHenry, who had just five points.\n\nThe Cougars forced Utah into 13 turnovers and converted those takeaways into 20 points.\n\n“They had a great defensive team, you want to take care of the ball as much as possible. You want to limit your turnovers,” said Utah’s Seydou Traore, who had one of Utah’s best individual stat lines of the night with 12 points, four assists, two rebounds and a steal.\n\n“Thirteen is kind of a lot playing a top 10 team like this, because they can execute off it every time. Gotta take care of the ball.”\n\nThe Cougars’ never-ending effort also led to a 12-5 edge in offensive rebounds, which turned into a 12-4 advantage in second-chance points.\n\n“Our margin for error as a team is small, but especially against Houston offensively, it’s going to be that much smaller,” Jensen said, after his team didn’t surpass 10 points in the second half until a Traore 3-pointer with 7:54 to play.\n\nKeanu Dawes had another solid night for the Utes in the loss, finishing with 15 points and eight rebounds. That included 9 early points to help keep Utah in the game through the first 10 minutes.\n\nAfter facing a pair of back-to-back top 10 programs, the Utes will have a few days’ rest, with their next game coming Sunday at Cincinnati.\n\nThere are some things Utah can take away from these games against juggernauts Kansas and Houston, who along with Arizona, sit atop the Big 12 standings.\n\n“That’s my message to the guys, not beating ourselves,” Jensen said. “… I keep saying it, our margin for error is small, but those little things that matter, and we’re getting better at it, but (focus) on the those little things that you can control. You can do it every possession — you might not make shots, but you can talk, which we’re getting better at.\n\n“And we had a couple good defensive possessions, then one guy didn’t block out tonight, but something you can control and do every time. So I think we’re learning that.”\n\nDawes can see the positives in these matchups as well, as he experiences his second year of Big 12 play.\n\n“This game probably got away from us faster than Kansas. I think it was about like the last eight minutes in Kansas,” Dawes said. “Things got away from us, but for the most part, we can really compete with any team. We just have to put it together for 40 minutes.”\n\nThat’s the objective Utah is chasing still, with seven games remaining in the regular season.",

Westchester then kicked it into gear, extending their lead to as many as 11 points in the first half while holding the Valley to just 19 points in the second quarter.\n\nDespite the deficit and being held under 20 points in the second, the Suns kept it competitive, trailing 56-47 at halftime.\n\nSep 24, 2025; Phoenix, AZ, USA; Phoenix Suns and Valley Suns guard Damion Baugh (30) poses for a portrait during Media Day at PHX Arena.

It didn’t take long for the Knicks to get their pace back, regaining their footing and taking an 81-70 lead.\n\nThe Knicks opened up another double-digit lead, but were limited from beyond the arc. It came down to the final seconds of the game, with the Valley in possession of the ball before Damion Baugh sank in a go-ahead shot from three to give the Suns the lead.\n\nFeb 6, 2026; Detroit, Michigan, USA; New York Knicks forward Pacome Dadiet (4) walks off the court after the game against the Detroit Pistons at Little Caesars Arena.

Jaden Shackelford and RJ Nembhard Jr. had 22 points each in the victory.\n\nThe Valley Suns now look towards their next challenge, taking on the Salt Lake City Stars on Thursday, Feb. 12, at 12 p.m.\n\nZac Gallen and Diamondbacks reunion?

    "fullText": "For roughly two hundred years, cricketers across the world have almost exclusively walked out to the crease and taken their guard with bats made of the finest English willow - but that is now set to change.\n\nThe Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) announced last week that the laws of the game would allow the use of laminated bats in open age recreational cricket from October.\n\nLamination is typically where the English willow face is backed by cheaper and lesser-performing willow, such as that from Kashmir.\n\nOne of the world's largest suppliers of English willow is based in Banbury, and its director Jonny Clarke welcomed the change, saying it could make the sport more affordable for amateurs.\n\n\"Nothing beats a beautiful English Willow cricket bat,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"But I think this change really could open the doors and give much more accessibility to keen young cricketers as a lower cost alternative.\"\n\nClarke's company, which is simply called English Willow, plants trees on under-used farmland across the country - which they then purchase back from landowners when the wood is ready to harvest.\n\n\"We're the only country in the world that grows it to the standard it is because we've got the climate and the soils,\" he explained.\n\n\"But [the sport] is exploding - there's more and more people in the world and there's millions of people every year wanting to play more and more cricket.\"\n\nAnnouncing the law change last week, MCC laws manager Fraser Stewart said it had been introduced to combat the rising price of bats, and would not be implemented for the top level of the game.\n\n\"We felt if anything can be done for the lower levels of the sport that will help make it more affordable without changing the dynamics of the game then it's a sensible move to make,\" Stewart told BBC Sport.\n\n\"There's not really enough willow to go round,\" he added.\n\nBat prices are thought to have trebled following increased demand from countries in South Asia, with some top-end models costing close to £1,000.\n\nClarke said his company was \"quite aligned\" with the MCC regarding the law change.\n\n\"We want to look at this industry and look at new ideas and how we can advance it and how we can open it up to other people who want to play,\" he said.\n\n\"Cricket is expensive, and this gives the chance for a cheaper option to come through on to the market,\" he added.\n\nYou can follow BBC Oxfordshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.\n\nMCC changes Laws of Cricket to permit previously 'illegal' bats",

James sat out the second night of a back-to-back to manage foot arthritis.\n\nWembanyama took full advantage, setting the tone with 25 points in just eight minutes on the floor in the first quarter.\n\nHe had 37 by halftime -- the most by any player in a first half this season -- when the Spurs led 84-55.\n\nHe cooled off in the third quarter, but matched the 40 points he put up on opening night before sitting out the fourth period with the rest of the Spurs starters.\n\nThe only down note for the Spurs was an injury to 2025 Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle, who took a hard fall under the basket in the second quarter and exited with a pelvic contusion.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers, fueled by 30 points from Pascal Siakam, stunned the New York Knicks 137-134 in an overtime thriller at Madison Square Garden.\n\nEight Pacers players scored in double figures to bring home the win in a game that featured a season-high 39 lead changes.\n\nAndrew Nembhard added 24 points and 10 rebounds and Quenton Jackson scored 19, including two game-sealing free-throws with 3.9 seconds left in overtime.\n\nJalen Brunson scored 40 points with five rebounds and eight assists for the Knicks. Josh Hart chipped in a triple-double of 15 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists.\n\nMikal Bridges and Karl-Anthony Towns added 22 points apiece -- Towns drilling two free-throws to force overtime before fouling out in the extra session.\n\nThe Pacers scored the first nine points in overtime before the Knicks staged a furious rally, cutting the deficit to one on a three-pointer from Brunson before Jackson closed it out at the line.\n\nThe Pacers have been a shadow of the team that beat the Knicks in the Eastern Conference finals last season with Tyrese Haliburton sidelined by the ruptured Achilles tendon he suffered in their NBA Finals loss to Oklahoma City.\n\nBut they snapped a four-game skid with just their fourth road win of the season, this one against a Knicks team that came in tied for the second most home wins in the league with 21.\n\n\"This was a really important game for us,\" said Pacers coach Rick Carlisle. \"The season that we've had, this environment, the opponent -- our guys had a great collective spirit and collective will tonight.\"\n\nIn Houston, Kevin Durant scored 26 points to lead the Rockets to a 102-95 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nDown by one at halftime, the Rockets took control in the third quarter. They led by six going into the fourth and quickly pushed the lead to 15 to cruise home.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nPuka Nacua and entrepreneur Shay Mitchell got it done at San Francisco’s Ghirardelli Square, hosting the “Béis Bowl Weekend” pop-up event at the San Francisco Brewing Co. With the activation, the brand capitalized on the festivities surrounding Super Bowl LX. The event at 3150 Polk Street drew hundreds of fans to “The City by the Bay” ahead of the big game.\n\nNacua had a dominant 2025 campaign for the Rams. The former BYU wide receiver, coming off a First-team All-Pro selection, led the NFL with 129 receptions and 1,715 receiving yards during the regular season. The performance made him the face of the brand’s first major sports-lifestyle crossover.\n\nWhile Bad Bunny headlined the halftime show during the Super Bowl, Béis founder Shay Mitchell had some headlines of her own to make. She called it the Béis Bowl.\n\nMitchell, who hosted the event on Feb. 7, selected Nacua as her official co-host.\n\n“Bad Bunny did the halftime. Béis did the weekend,” Mitchell captioned a post.\n\nThe snap showed a digital timer set to 00:00:00 and white traffic cones branded with the Béis logo. Mitchell was pictured on the left, wearing a brown leather jacket and plaid skirt, while Nacua stood to the right in a blazer and jeans.\n\n“Bad Bunny did the halftime. Béis did the weekend,” Shay Mitchell. @AsapPukapic.twitter.com/PbUX9rclyh\n\n— MOHAMMAD ASIF ANSARI (@WriterMohammad) February 11, 2026\n\nThe exclusive activation featured a “Gameplan” itinerary that included football-themed challenges where Nacua and Mitchell competed against guests. Nacua utilized the event to engage with the local community days after participating in the 2026 Pro Bowl Games at San Francisco’s Moscone Center.\n\n“I’m really happy for those guys; I think there were a lot of guys that were also recognized as alternates,” Rams head coach Sean McVay stated regarding the Pro Bowl honors.\n\nMORE: Puka Nacua faces backlash over comments about Sam Darnold after Seahawks' Super Bowl win\n\nDespite missing out on a Super Bowl appearance, Nacua continued his stellar play into the postseason. In the NFC Championship on Jan. 25, the Rams wideout recorded nine catches for 165 yards and a touchdown against the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nNacua wasn’t the only one making waves on social media. On Jan. 31, he initiated a viral exchange by quoting an interview featuring actress Sydney Sweeney, who noted she needed someone to “go skydiving with me.”\n\n“Love skydiving,” Nacua wrote. During the 2026 Super Bowl media week, he escalated the joke, claiming, “I have reservations for us on Wednesday, actually.”\n\nLove skydiving https://t.co/evgL5lqw7M\n\n— Puka Nacua (@AsapPuka) January 31, 2026\n\nHowever, the All-Pro pass catcher later admitted to Overtime that the claim was a “full send” joke, confessing he has an actual fear of heights. Speaking to NFL Network’s Colleen Wolfe ahead of the NFL Honors, he maintained the bit, promising to “get a video of it.” The “No Fear” mantra on his cleats was cited as motivation.\n\nWhile Nacua and the internet had their fun, Sweeney has been linked to music executive Scooter Braun throughout early 2026. On the other hand, Nacua was photographed dining with influencer Hannah Stocking at Matsuhisa in West Hollywood on Jan. 31.\n\nRams Super Bowl champion with 148 career starts announces retirement\n\nRams linked to trade for beloved Eagles backup QB as Matthew Stafford insurance\n\nRams should be 'sick' watching Seahawks win Super Bowl, claims analyst\n\nRams get exciting Kliff Kingsbury coaching news from ESPN report",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAlthough the Ohio State Buckeyes failed to repeat as national champions this past season, they are part of a select group of three consecutive Big Ten teams to win it all.\n\nWhether this year will continue the conference's trend, the Buckeyes are going to attempt to remain in that mix for a league and national title under coach Ryan Day.\n\nSome analysts, including CBS Sports' Cody Nagel, aren't fond of the Buckeyes' national title hopes entering this fall as he assessed 25 teams in a way-too-early Top 25 network.\n\nNagel ranked the Buckeyes at No. 1 despite him predicting that they will lose at least three games for the first time in 15 seasons.\n\n\"Ohio State has been a perennial national championship contender for most of the 21st century and expects to be in the title hunt again in 2026,\" Nagel wrote. \"But the Buckeyes face more hurdles than usual with one of the nation's toughest schedules, including five opponents from [Brandon] Marcello's way-too-early top 25. Ohio State hasn't lost more than two games since 2011. If there was ever a year for that streak to end, this is it.\"\n\nMORE: Kirk Herbstreit shares true feelings about Michigan's Bryce Underwood entering 2026 season\n\nFurther along in Nagel's preview, he notes that the Michigan Wolverines will regain momentum in \"The Game\" rivalry this November. Therefore, it would give the Wolverines their first head-to-head win against Ohio State since 2024. To make matters worse for the Buckeyes, their Nov. 7 opponent (Oregon Ducks) are a potential national title pick. Therefore, another loss there seems more likely than not.\n\nShould the Buckeyes miss the postseason, it would further validate the fact that the pressure Day faces from the Buckeyes' fanbase is real, raw and unapologetic.\n\nIf Nagel is proven correct, the next year in Columbus is going to be extremely interesting.\n\nMORE: Patriots coach Mike Vrabel shares harsh reality after losing Super Bowl 60 to Seahawks\n\nIllinois 2026 football schedule\n\nMichigan 2026 football schedule\n\nOhio State 2026 football schedule",

    "fullText": "Florida State softball added a win against Liberty to their record, as they took down the Flames in a late effort to secure a run 8-0 run rule.\n\nNewly crowned ACC Pitcher of the Week, Jazzy Francik got her third start of the week. Francik worked around a leadoff walk, keeping Liberty off the board.\n\nIn the bottom of the inning, the Seminoles saw Gabby Mike in the circle. Early, Isa Torres had the defense scrambling on a soft hit single on the infield. Mike added Jaysoni Beachum on base by hit by pitch, however, the Liberty defense put up a 0 in the first inning.\n\nAfter a 3 up, 3 down inning from Francik, the Seminoles bats looked to push across their first run. A hard hit single from Marin Heller, walk to Beachum, and Shelby McKenzie single mishandled by the defense had ‘Noles at every bag.\n\nMike rolled a pair of ground balls, keeping the bases loaded, but putting two outs on the board. Now with Hayley Griggs at the plate, the freshman drew a walk to break the scoreless tie.\n\nAfter causing through the first three innings, Francik saw traffic in the 4th. A walk, followed by a single up the middle had Liberty threatening with no outs. A comebacker to the circle, followed by a ground ball to third, which turned into a double play by Beachum got FSU out of the inning unscathed.\n\nFIRE US UP DEFENSE🔥🔥🔥\n\nBack-to-back clutch plays to get us out of the inning‼️\n\n📺ACCNX#Team43 pic.twitter.com/ZfaXNotHDk\n\n— Florida State Softball 🥎 (@FSU_Softball) February 11, 2026\n\nMarlee Gaskell took over for Francik, looking to hold her teams 1-0 lead.

Liberty went to the bullpen, after Danley’s hit took Mike out of the circle. Out of the bullpen, it was Caitlyn Nesbitt to face the rest of the FSU lineup.\n\nFor her first batter, Nesbitt walked Anna Hinde with one out. A single into the outfield from Griggs scored one, and a single from Makenna Sturgis got another run in. The Liberty defense had trouble with the ball, leading to the fourth run of the game.\n\nTHESE FRESHMEN‼️‼️‼️\n\nHayley and Makenna with back-to-back singles to make it 4-0🍢🍢\n\n📺ACCNX pic.twitter.com/VGLSE6FOox\n\n— Florida State Softball 🥎 (@FSU_Softball) February 11, 2026\n\nAn error, leading to a walk, put runners in scoring position with two outs.

They played some superb football in that first half.\n\nPedro was fantastic leading the line again, and he earned some rightful praise from his manager after the game in his post-match interview.\n\nBut Leeds got back into the game and managed to get two goals themselves to end it with points shared, which was far from good enough for Chelsea.\n\nFirst they gave away a silly penalty after Moises Caicedo had a daft moment in our own box. Then not long after that, somehow between a bunch of them, mainly Josh Acheampong and Robert Sanchez, they failed to make a simple clearance and allowed Leeds to pounce in and score their second goal of the game.\n\nMamadou Sarr signs for Chelsea.\n\nI mean, he was bought back for a reason, right? And that wasn’t to sit on the bench. If he is as good as they say he is, then it might be time to start him soon, after an obvious settling back in period I would assume.\n\nChelsea need more confidence, dominance, and less panic in the heart of the defence, and hopefully he can provide just that.",

    "description": "The Los Angeles Angels won their arbitration hearing with Reid Detmers, locking him in at $2.625 million after a season that saw the former top pick find new success following a move to the bullpen.",
    "fullText": "ANAHEIM -- The Los Angeles Angels have won their arbitration hearing regarding Reid Detmers, as reported by Mark Feinsand of MLB.com. Detmers will be paid $2.625 million by the Angels rather than the $2.925 million figure that Detmers and his camp submitted.\n\nReid Detmers has lost his arbitration hearing against the Angels, per source. Detmers will earn $2.625 million in 2026; he had filed at $2.925 million.\n\n— Mark Feinsand (@Feinsand) February 11, 2026\n\nDetmers, who is coming off a solid season in which he posted a 3.96 ERA across 63.2 innings, saw his role change for the first time in his major league career, making the transition from a starter to a reliever.\n\nDetmers was effective as a reliever, striking out 30% of the batters he faced this past season. This comes as Detmers is coming off his best year since 2022, when he was still seen as a promising starter and the next reliable pitcher to come out of the Angels organization in a long time.\n\nDetmers, who was originally drafted with the 10th overall pick in the 2020 MLB Draft, was expected to provide the Angels with a frontline starter during a period when the organization lacked rotation depth. 2022 was the year in which he posted a 3.77 ERA across 25 starts and 129 innings.\n\nThis is also the same year in which Detmers recorded his no-hitter against the Tampa Bay Rays in May, the 12th no-hitter in franchise history, and the first complete game of his career.\n\nSafe to say, the Angels likely thought they were getting their next really good starter since the Jered Weaver era. Still, even after a promising year, struggles began to pile up, as Detmers was never able to find that same level of success until he eventually made the transition from being a starter to a reliever.\n\nEven with the newfound success, the Angels are expected to use Detmers as a reliever once again this upcoming season, though he currently projects as the No. 3 starter in the Angels' rotation behind Yusei Kikuchi and José Soriano.\n\nLikely, the Angels will be relying on a few reclamation projects to work in their favor, as they also brought in Grayson Rodriguez, a former top prospect, and Alek Manoah, a former All-Star in 2022, to help fill out the rotation.\n\nNevertheless, Detmers was the only player to have an arbitration hearing this past offseason. His loss is just the second out of nine cases announced so far.",

In an interview with 'Mundo Deportivo', the Uruguayan has now openly talked about the most difficult time in his career.\n\n\"I fought against anxiety for a year and a half, and it eventually turned into depression,\" admitted the Barça star. Araújo explained that he tried to bottle everything up and just \"keep going\" out of habit.\n\nBut this had consequences: the lack of inner stability and dwindling self-confidence affected not only his athletic performance but also his private life.\n\nThe turning point came when Araújo realized he couldn't go on alone. He described how important it was to \"raise his hand\" and accept help—from his family, his faith, and above all, from professional support.\n\nIn the meantime, according to his own statement, the Barcelona professional now feels \"completely different.\" His goal in the cup against Albacete was also a powerful emotional sign for him: a moment that showed he is on his way back.\n\nAt the same time, Araújo used his story to send a clear message: \"We are human beings, not just footballers. It's not just about money or fame.\"\n\nAraújo emphasized that working with experts has given him the necessary tools to cope with pressure and, ultimately, to be able to play football happily again.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "A few weeks ago, I was staring at a system prompt that was 127,000 tokens long. One hundred and twenty-seven thousand tokens - just the system prompt. Most of it was, you guessed it, tool schemas: JSON definitions for every possible thing the agent could do, most of which it would never touch in any given run.\n\nMy solution? I propose AgentScript: a code-first execution language where the LLM can only interact with the outside world by writing programs. No tool schemas, no function calling, no MCP, no multi-modal response gymnastics. The model writes code, a sandboxed runtime executes it, and the return value is the response. As simple as that.\n\nHere’s how tool calling works today: you define a bunch of tools as JSON schemas, stuff them into the system prompt, and hope the model picks the right one. Each tool needs a name, a description, parameter definitions, and examples. A single tool can easily consume hundreds of tokens. A production-grade system might have tens, sometimes hundrends, of tools.\n\nAnd the tools the model never uses still consume tokens - they’re sitting in the context window like furniture in a storage unit you’re paying rent on but never visiting (I would know something about that). As systems grow, you get this compounding problem: context inflation drives up latency and reduces alignment, both in turn drive up costs, and costs scale non-linearly because you’re paying for all those schema tokens on every single inference call.\n\nSince many agent tasks require iteration, filtering, branching, retries, and aggregation, when you encode these behaviors through repeated LLM calls or chained tool invocations, you’re effectively using natural language as a programming language. You’re asking the model to be both the thinker and the doer, when decades of CS have taught us that these should be separate concerns.\n\nIn the last few months, I’ve seen this become an exciting idea space: Program-of-thought prompting, code interpreter systems, Anthropic’s work on code execution with MCP - they all point to the same conclusion: models are better planners than executors, and deterministic computation belongs outside the model.\n\nAgentScript takes that insight to its logical conclusion.\n\nAgentScript enforces a code-only contract between a language model and its execution environment. In this world, the LLM is not an API client, not it is a conversational participant; it’s a program author that can only emit AgentScript code. So there is only one execution entry point, and all interaction with the world happens through code.\n\nThis collapses tool calling, function responses, and structured outputs into a single universal abstraction: program execution.\n\nThe execution model is deliberately boring:\n\nIntermediate data never enters the model’s context unless the program explicitly reads the persisted logs from the file system. This is my main insight: pull-based data access instead of push-based context stuffing.\n\nThe API surface can be intentionally tiny, for example:\n\nThe model already knows JavaScript. The API is small enough to learn once and never forget.\n\nAnd the safety model is simple: constraints are enforced by the runtime, not the model. The model can write whatever code it wants. The sandbox decides what actually executes, like only mounting the working directory, allowlisted commands, or network access.\n\nTo start with, a backwards-compatible model would be to force a tool call from LLM responses and only give it a single tool: execute_agentscript, and stop the loop based on the execution of the code.\n\nThere are also a few extensions I’m thinking about:\n\nWhen systems become too complex to reason about in prose, you re-found them on code. This has happened repeatedly in computing history, and it’s happening again now to agents.\n\nWritten on a flight from Amsterdam to New Delhi",

    "fullText": "I’m building a typesetting engine for a living (speedata Publisher). People keep asking me “why not just use Typst?” or “isn’t WeasyPrint good enough?” and I never had a good answer with real numbers. Just gut feeling. So I decided to actually measure it.\n\nI set up a simple benchmark, same document with all six tools. And what I learned was maybe not what I expected.\n\nThe task is simple: a mail merge. You have an XML file with name and address records, you fill in a letter template, and you get a PDF out. One page per letter, with a logo, sender info, recipient address, and some body text. Nothing special, really every tool should be able to do this.\n\nI tested with 1 record and with 500 records. All templates produce more or less the same visual output. Same A4 page, same Helvetica (or the similar TeX Gyre Heros clone), same logo, same layout with the sender on the right side and body text at 105mm width with hyphenation turned on.\n\nAll benchmarks ran with hyperfine on a macBook air M4 (16 GB). You can find the full setup on GitHub if you want to try it yourself.\n\nWith one page, sp and Typst are basically the same. Both under 110ms. Everything else is 3.5 to 5.6 times slower.\n\nOK so this is where it gets interesting. Typst does 500 pages in 157 milliseconds. That is not a typo. Once it is running, it spends about 0.3ms per page. sp, which was basically equal at one page, needs 4.4 seconds — 28 times slower.\n\nAt one page they are tied, at 500 pages it is not even close. Typst has maybe 60ms startup cost, and after that it just flies. The per-page cost of sp is roughly 28 times higher.\n\nAlso worth noting: WeasyPrint really does not scale well. It goes from “ok” at one page to “maybe go get a coffee” at 500. pdflatex on the other hand scales surprisingly well — the per-page cost is only about 0.8ms if you subtract the startup.\n\nSo if speed is all you care about, just use Typst, right?\n\nThis is where it gets more complicated. Open the PDFs next to each other and look at the body text:\n\nYou see the difference? The justified text looks different. Not because of different fonts — the decisions are different. Where to break the lines, where to hyphenate, how to distribute the whitespace.\n\npdflatex and sp use algorithms based on Knuth & Plass (the TeX line breaking algorithm). They look at the whole paragraph at once and find the best set of breakpoints for all lines together. The result is even word spacing, no rivers of white, and good hyphenation.\n\nTypst, WeasyPrint, and FOP seemingly use a much simpler algorithm. It looks like they go line by line from top to bottom and decide for each line separately. This is faster — and that is probably part of the reason why Typst scales so well. But you can see it. Some lines are too loose, some too tight. Hyphenation sometimes feels a bit random.\nEdit Typst’s author has clarified: “However, one thing we noticed is your assertion in the justification section that Typst is not using Knuth-Plass – we do, by default when justification is enabled. The only thing of the original paper we don’t implement are tightness classes to prevent a very tight line and a very wide line directly next to each other.”\n\nFor a simple letter, honestly both are fine. But try a narrow column with a technical text full of long words, and then you really see the difference. The Knuth-Plass output looks like a properly typeset book. The first-fit output looks like a web page that somebody printed.\n\nA benchmark cannot capture this.\n\nHere is what actually matters in production, and it has nothing to do with milliseconds: what happens when the content does not fit?\n\nThink of a product catalog. Each product gets one page: a data table at the top, product photos at the bottom. Simple enough. But then product number 47 has a table with 30 rows instead of 10. Now what?\n\nIn Typst, you can use measure() to get the height of the table and compare it with the available space. That is a reasonable approximation. But Typst cannot do a real trial layout across page breaks — it measures content in a single frame only.\n\nIn the speedata Publisher, you can do this:\n\nThis is real trial typesetting. It actually lays out the full content, with real page breaks, counts how many pages it needs, and then you decide: keep it, or throw it away and try with different settings. No other tool in this benchmark can do that.\n\nIs this slower than just going through the content without looking back? Of course. And maybe that is part of why sp is 28 times slower at 500 pages — it is built for careful layout, not for fast layout. But the alternative is that a human opens each PDF and manually checks if page 47 looks right. That is not a millisecond problem, that is a “you need to hire someone” problem.\n\nHere is an actual page from a spare parts catalog, built with the speedata Publisher. This is a very typical use case for a product catalog.\n\nLook at what is happening on this page. The data table grows from top to bottom — model by model, row by row. The product images at the bottom grow from bottom to top, in rows of up to four. The table and the images share the same page, and neither is allowed to overlap the other. The number of table rows varies per page, the number of product images varies per page, and the layout has to figure out on its own how to divide the available space.\n\nThis is not a fixed template. It is an adaptive layout. The engine places the table, measures how much room is left, and fills the remaining space with as many product images as will fit — bottom-aligned, in rows of four. If a page has fewer products, you get two images in the last row instead of four. If the table is longer, the images get pushed to the next page. All of this happens automatically, without a human touching any page.\n\nHow would you do this with the other tools?\n\nIn Typst, you could get close. You would measure() the table height, calculate the remaining space, and manually arrange images in a grid at the bottom. But you are doing layout math by hand, and if the table happens to break across pages, things get complicated fast. Typst has no built-in way to say “fill the rest of this page from the bottom up.”\n\nIn pdflatex or LuaLaTeX, you enter the world of TeX float placement — \\vfill, \\bottomrule, maybe a minipage at the bottom. For a single page with a known table height, you could hack something together. But for hundreds of pages where the table height varies? You would likely write a Lua callback in LuaLaTeX that inspects the page after layout and inserts the images. Possible, but painful.\n\nIn WeasyPrint, this is essentially not possible. CSS has no concept of “fill the remaining page from the bottom.” You would have to pre-calculate the table height outside of the rendering engine and generate custom CSS per page. At that point, you are not really using a layout engine anymore — you are the layout engine.\n\nIn Apache FOP, XSL-FO has some support for this kind of thing with region-after and fo:block-container, but in practice FOP’s implementation is limited. You might get a rough approximation, but the automatic “grow from bottom” behavior is not something FOP handles well.\n\nIn the speedata Publisher, this is roughly a dozen lines of layout XML. Place the table, ask how much space is left, arrange the images in the remaining area. It is exactly the kind of problem the tool was built for.\n\nThe real comparison is not “which tool is the fastest at a trivial task.” It is “which tool can even handle the task.”\n\nFor a mail merge, use Typst. Seriously. It is fast, the source files are nice to write, and the output looks good enough.\n\nBut once your layout needs go beyond “fill in a template, output PDF” — once you need the software to actually make decisions — things change. And that is where tools like sp become worth it, even if they need a few hundred milliseconds more per page.\n\nI went into this benchmark hoping that sp would be fastest at everything. It is not. Typst is 28 times faster at 500 pages, and I cannot really argue with that — they have done amazing engineering work.\n\nBut I also realized that the benchmark I set up — a simple mail merge — is exactly the kind of task where the strengths of sp do not show up at all. It is like you compare a sports car and a pickup truck on a flat highway. Sure, the sports car is faster. But that is not what you bought the truck for.\n\nThe right question is not “how many pages per second.” It is “how many pages until you need a human to check.” And that is much harder to measure.\n\nThe complete benchmark setup (all templates, scripts, and data) is on GitHub.

    "fullText": "Hobby tunneling is tunnel construction as a pastime.[1][2] Usually, hobby tunnelers dig their tunnels by hand, using little equipment, and some can spend years or even decades to achieve any degree of completion.[2] In some cases tunnels have been dug secretly, and only discovered by chance.\n\nA tunnel is an underground passageway, dug through the surrounding soil or rock for the purpose of transport, passage or communication.[2] Tunnel construction is a sub-discipline of civil engineering[3] and usually the domain of engineers and construction companies. When civilians dig tunnels, it may be for criminal purposes (like smuggling or hiding illegal goods),[2] or gaining unauthorised access to an area.\n\nTunneling may be part of the building of underground dwellings. Subterranean construction may be done as an art form, as in the work of Ra Paulette.[4] Dutch graphic designer Leanne Wijnsma[1] digs short, shallow tunnels as an art form and for fun.[2] She had dug thirteen by 2015,[1] three at cultural festivals.[5]\n\nA few people have dug tunnels as a hobby or for fun, although some have given additional reasons for their activities. Seymour Cray, for instance, said that the work of digging helped him to think about other problems, and Harrison Dyar saw digging as a form of exercise.\n\nSome hobbyists started out constructing something useful, but continued digging after completion. This was the case with William Lyttle, who started by digging a wine cellar,[6] and Michael Altmann, who excavated a cooling cellar for a café. A Swiss contemporary of Altmann named Peter Junker dug in his garden, searching for water,[7] but continued digging after finding some, excavating a tunnel length of 220 metres (720 ft).[8]\n\nOthers maintain that they excavated for a particular purpose, although their tunnelling effort seems out of proportion to the stated purpose.[2] Dyar biographer Marc Epstein thinks it is mainly outsiders that desire a sense of purpose. On Dyar's tunneling for exercise reasons he says that \"it’s almost unfathomable, the amount of energy it would take\" and that \"it still doesn’t add up\".[2]\n\nAuthor Will Hunt thinks extensive tunnelling is at least part obsession.[6] Psychiatrist Anton Tölk believes that tunnel digging can be interpreted as a desire to return to the security of the mother's womb,[7] and that as an activity it allows contemplative satisfaction.[7]\n\nBetween 1958 and 2008, Austrian Michael Altmann dug two tunnels of 180 metres (590 ft) combined.[7] At first, he wanted a cooling cellar for a cafe he was to open, but upon completion he could not get a permit.[7] In 1965, he took over another bar, but kept his digging as a hobby. Altmann would mainly use a pickaxe for digging and occasionally explosives, after passing an explosives handling examination at the fire department.[7] He dug a second tunnel branching off from the first one, using a tunnel drilling machine he designed and built himself.[7] In 1962, he installed steel doors on the tunnel system and added a store of emergency rations, with the intention of making it usable as a nuclear bunker.[7]\n\nIn 2008, Altmann reached a block of granite and, considering his age, gave up tunnel digging.[7]\n\nLyova (or Levon) Arakelyan dug a storage cellar under his house on the edge of Yerevan in 1985.[6] When completed, he continued to dig and kept at it for some 23 years, constructing an extensive complex of tunnels, rooms and stairs which extended 21 metres (69 ft) deep into solid rock.[1] Arakelyan stated that he received directions for his work in dreams and visions.[9] The underground spaces were transformed into a museum, called 'Divine Underground', after his death in 2008.[9] Arakelyan never made any money from his tunneling in life, and the museum provides some income for his family.[9]\n\nThe 5th Duke of Portland is known to have been a hobby tunneler, although he did no digging himself that we know of but rather had workmen build his tunnels. An extensive network of underground spaces was constructed at his Welbeck Abbey estate in the 19th century, with a total length of around 24 kilometres (15 mi).[11] It included hallways, a ballroom, a billiards room, a library and a 900 metres (3,000 ft) tunnel from the mansion to the riding house, wide enough for several people to walk in side by side.[11] Some of the spaces were lit by lightwells and at night by gas lighting.[10] Most of the spaces that are known as 'underground' are, more correctly, 'below ground', constructed in a cut-and-cover technique.\n\nFew of the tunnels and rooms were ever used for their intended purpose. Towards the end of his life, the Duke lived as a recluse and very few people got to see him. Spaces that were intended for social gatherings, such as the ballroom, were never used. But the Duke did frequently use the tunnels that allowed him to move about his property mostly unseen.\n\nThe American engineer and supercomputer architect Seymour Cray is known to have been a hobby tunneller.[12] Cray built an 8 by 4 feet (2.4 by 1.2 m) cedar-floored tunnel under his house,[13] explaining that the digging helped him to think about computer designs: \"While I'm digging in the tunnel, the elves will often come to me with solutions to my problem.\"[14]\n\nThe American entomologist Harrison Gray Dyar Jr. constructed a network of tunnels on two occasions, with a length of 400 metres (1,300 ft) combined.[6] His first, under his Washington, D.C. home was accidentally discovered during construction work in 1917, without drawing much attention.[15] It was rediscovered in 1924, when a truck sank through the pavement nearby.[6] The tunnel system led to speculation in the press, not in the least because many German newspapers from the war years of 1917 and 1918 were found in the tunnels.[15] After a few days Dyar came forward as the tunnels' constructor, claiming he had dug them between 1906 and 1916, when he relocated to California.[15]\n\nBack in Washington a few years later, Dyar dug out a second set of tunnels under his new home.[15] The network had concrete lined walls, steel staircases and electric lighting.[15][16] Dyar described hobby tunneling as a kind of exercise for him, saying \"some men play golf, I dig tunnels\".[1]\n\nIn 1904, Sicilian immigrant Baldassare Forestiere bought a 32-acre (13 ha) plot of land in Fresno for horticulture.[17] The hardpan soil however, was unsuited for the fruit trees he intended to plant. While working elsewhere, Forestiere dug a maze of underground and below ground spaces to escape the summer heat of the San Joaquin Valley.[17] He opened up ceilings to let in light and below he planted the fruit trees he wanted in the first place. The complex consists of bedrooms, living spaces, patios, a fish pond and hallways.[17] After his death in 1946, some of the land was sold off and some tunnels filled in, but currently about 8 acres (3.2 ha) have been saved. It is known as the Forestiere Underground Gardens and has a listing in the National Register of Historic Places.[18]\n\nGlen Havens of San Diego, US constructed a maze of tunnels and caverns under his house.[19] Havens started out in 1949, enlarging his barbecue pit, but ended up digging roughly 200 metres (660 ft) of tunnels and underground rooms.[19] Havens enlisted the help of his son and other children in the neighbourhood, who earned pocket money in the process.[20] The underground complex was large enough to hold his daughter's wedding reception in 1960, with some 200 guests attending.[20] Havens ignored building regulations and never got any permit. Local authorities recommended that people not to go inside, but took no further action. A local restaurant is named the \"Haven Pizzeria\" in Havens' honor.[citation needed]\n\nIn the 1960s, Irish civil engineer William Lyttle dug a wine cellar under his Hackney property.[1] Having done so, he said that he had \"found a taste for the thing\" and continued digging for forty years.[21] Eventually, several tunnels on multiple levels led in all directions, under the property and surrounding grounds, some of them 18.2 metres (60 ft) long.[21] After complaints by neighbours, a power supply interruption and a sinkhole in the pavement, the borough had a survey carried out that revealed the extent of the tunneling.[21] Lyttle was evicted and the tunnels were filled with concrete.[21]\n\nWilliam \"Burro\" Schmidt was an American miner who spent 38 years drilling a 636-metre (2,087 ft) tunnel through solid granite.[6] Construction began in 1902, with Schmidt claiming to be building a shortcut from his mining operation to the smelter.[22] When a new road was constructed, rendering his shortcut obsolete, Schmidt carried on his work regardless.[23] He used simple handtools and occasionally explosives for tunneling, carrying out the debris in a wheelbarrow or on the backs of his two donkeys.[22]\n\nCosta Rican miner Manuel Barrantes has built an underground family house, consisting of hallways, bedrooms, conference rooms and a bathroom.[1] The complex, totalling 186 square metres (2,000 sq ft), is used as a home and a museum.[1]\n\nThe Williamson Tunnels are a network of tunnels in Liverpool, England, thought to have been dug under the direction of tobacco merchant Joseph Williamson between 1810 and 1840. Their purpose remains unknown, with some speculating that they were built as a folly.\n\nIn Butler, Pennsylvania, US man Ron Heist created a 50-room dwelling made of salvaged materials from abandoned places in the vicinity. It includes several tunnels Heist dug out and reinforced himself.[24] A documentary film was made about him, entitled Mole Man.[25]\n\nIn 1984, Russian Leonid Murlyanchik had the plan of digging a 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) tunnel towards the house of his beloved Ekaterina.[1] However, after Ekaterina's son objected to the liaison, he changed his intention into building a subway system for his home city of Lebedyan.[1] For 27 years Murlyanchik spent most of his hours, and his pension money, on the project.[1] At his death in 2011 he had completed 300 metres (980 ft) of tunnel, which was subsequently closed off.[1]\n\nIn late 2003, steeplejack and television personality Fred Dibnah began to dig a replica coal mine in the back garden of his home. Using traditional shaft-sinking techniques and the labour of mining friends Alf Molyneux and Jimmy Crooks, the shaft was sunk to a depth of 20 feet (6.1 m) and lined with brick. The work had been undertaken without planning permission, and, when the council eventually found out what was happening, they insisted he apply for planning permission.[26] Dibnah died in 2004.[27]\n\n'Sandland' is a tunnel complex in western Wisconsin created by Eric Sutterlin, a contract mechanical engineer from the Minneapolis area. Sutterlin began digging tunnels in the Jordan Sandstone after purchasing the property in 2011, aided by a network of volunteers in the years since. Sutterlin estimates that as of January 2025, he has contributed more than $100,000 of his own money in developing Sandland. Designed to be an underground crawling maze, the tunnel complex contains a number of turns, dead-ends, and even hosts an underground bar. Future additions are slated to include an underground slide and a standing-level maze section. The site also hosts a number of aboveground attractions, including a decommissioned monorail from the Minnesota Zoo and a treehouse, the latter of which was moved to ground-level for safety reasons.[28]\n\nIn 2015, a 10 metres (33 ft) tunnel was discovered in a Toronto park. After a few days of speculations in media, the use as a terrorist hideout being among them, young construction worker Elton McDonald came forward as its builder.[1] Asked for the purpose of his digging, he answered \"Honestly, I loved it so much. I don't know why I loved it\".[1]\n\nYouTube personality and inventor Colin Furze has constructed an underground bunker and tunnel system under his home and workshop in Stamford, Lincolnshire,\ninitially in 2015 as part of a promotion for Sky television's You, Me and the Apocalypse series.[29]\n\nTikTok creator Kala, or @engineer.everything, has been in the process of creating a tunnel system underneath her suburban home since August 2022.[30]\n\nSeveral urban legends and hoaxes involving private tunnels have appeared in media. One such a story is about an Irishman who dug a tunnel from his bedroom to his local pub, without his wife noticing.[31] In one version of the story, that did the rounds at least between 2014 and 2018, the tunneler is said to have used a spoon for digging.[31]\n\nWhen a tunnel in Calgary was discovered in 2016, a local newspaper ran a do it yourself tunneling manual as a story.[32]\n\nThe 1997 novel The Underground Man is loosely based on the life and tunneling of the 5th Duke of Portland.",

    "fullText": "As AI job losses rise in the professional sector, many are switching to more traditional trades. But how do they feel about accepting lower pay – and, in some cases, giving up their vocation?\n\nCalifornia-based Jacqueline Bowman had been dead set on becoming a writer since she was a child. At 14 she got her first internship at her local newspaper, and later she studied journalism at university. Though she hadn’t been able to make a full-time living from her favourite pastime – fiction writing – post-university, she consistently got writing work (mostly content marketing, some journalism) and went freelance full-time when she was 26. Sure, content marketing wasn’t exactly the dream, but she was writing every day, and it was paying the bills – she was happy enough.\n\n“But something really switched in 2024,” Bowman, now 30, says. Layoffs and publication closures meant that much of her work “kind of dried up. I started to get clients coming to me and talking about AI,” she says – some even brazen enough to tell her how “great” it was “that we don’t need writers any more”. She was offered work as an editor – checking and altering work produced by artificial intelligence. The idea was that polishing up already-written content would take less time than writing it from scratch, so Bowman’s fee was reduced to about half of what it had been when she was writing for the same content marketing agency – but, in reality, it ended up taking double the time.\n\n“I now had to meticulously fact-check every single thing in the articles. And at least 60% of it would be completely made up,” she says. “I would just end up rewriting most of the article. So something that would take me two hours when I was writing it by myself now took me four hours, making half the money.”\n\nTo add insult to injury, Bowman’s few remaining clients have sometimes accused her of using AI to create her work. “I never use AI to write anything,” she says, but she has noticed that AI-produced copy can sometimes seem eerily similar to her own writing – which she suspects is due to large language models being trained on some of her previous work. She can’t afford to take any of the Silicon Valley giants to court – though she is grateful for the authors, like George Saunders and Ta-Nehisi Coates, who have done so.\n\nShe remembered a psychology elective she had enjoyed in college, and wondered if she might be able to make a more secure living by becoming a therapist. “It’s not AI-proof” – Bowman admits that some people will be happy to use AI-powered therapy services, which already exist. “But there’s another subsection of people who are going to say: ‘Hey, AI took my job, AI ruined my life. I’m not going to go to an AI therapist,’” she says. “So in that way, I do think that there’s still going to be an audience who wants a human therapist.”\n\nBowman decided to take action and retrain, “while I still do have a little bit of work”, and is now back at university studying to become a marriage and family therapist. She counts herself “incredibly lucky” because she is able to rely on her husband, and on any writing work she can still get, to make ends meet – but has still had to take out loans. She’s enjoying the course, and is “glad she has the opportunity to do it”, but it is not something she would have considered if her writing work hadn’t become untenable.\n\nJanet Feenstra, an academic editor turned baker based in Malmö, Sweden, also has mixed feelings about her career change, a choice she similarly made because of fears that AI would make her old job void. “It’s complicated because, in a way, I maybe should be grateful to AI for prompting this change,” she says. Feenstra now works at “a really cute bakery”, where she and her colleagues “roll out the dough by hand and it feels amazing”.\n\n“We listen to music and we dance and sing whenever we want,” she adds. “I have a lot more fun now, but I don’t want to be grateful to AI for this – I’m still a little bit bitter.” It felt like a forced career change, rather than one she was choosing on her own terms, she explains – not to mention the fact that she now gets paid less, travels farther to work and does a much more tiring job.\n\nSince 2013, the 52-year-old, who is originally from the US, had been working as a freelance editor alongside a part-time job at Malmö University doing what is called “language editing”: tidying up texts written by researchers whose first language isn’t English.\n\n“The standard of English here in Sweden is very, very high, so this was very specialised academic editing,” she says. “The international journals are very picky, so it required a certain expertise that we could offer.” However, in recent years, she began to hear people within the university talking about wanting to use AI. “It was scary. I felt like the writing was on the wall a bit,” Feenstra says. She began to realise that if a manuscript “is already quite good”, then an AI system prompted to meet academic journal requirements might be able to do the work she had been doing.\n\n“I didn’t want to wait until it was too late,” she says. “I felt scared … I’m divorced, I have two children to look after and I need financial security.” So she decided to retrain in something she “was fairly sure that AI would not replace anytime soon”, and enrolled in culinary school.\n\nIt wasn’t an easy transition. “I had to move out because I wasn’t able to afford my rent any more,” she says, which meant that her sons, who had previously lived between their parents’ two homes, had to live full-time with their father. While Feenstra embarked on her year-long training, she moved in with her partner, whose flat was too small to house her sons as well. Now, having worked in the bakery for five months, she has recently signed a contract on a new flat, which will have room for her sons. “I’ve had to work really hard: I’ve had to retrain, I’ve had to accept lower pay and conditions that are physically challenging,” Feenstra says. But securing the flat “is really exciting because it’s a goal realised”.\n\nFeenstra says it has been “an interesting journey” to go from a job typically associated with middle-class people to one seen as working-class. “White-collar work isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, I’ve realised,” she says. “But it requires an adjustment. We’re so defined by our jobs and our class.”\n\nPerhaps those definitions of what counts as a “good” or “middle class” job will begin to change: a 2023 report on the impact of AI on jobs and training in the UK by the Department for Education concluded that: “Professional occupations are more exposed to AI, particularly those associated with more clerical work and across finance, law and business management roles.” And, rightly or wrongly, Feenstra is not alone in deciding that learning a trade is a relatively safe bet.\n\nAngela Joyce, the CEO of Capital City College, a further education provider in London, says: “We’re seeing a steady growth in students of all ages coming to us to do trades-based qualifications,” in subjects such as engineering, culinary arts and childcare. There is “definitely a shift” away from traditional academic routes, she says, which she attributes to the high numbers of unemployed young people – and “a good proportion of those are graduates”, she notes. That shift towards seeking vocational training is “in part linked to AI”, Joyce thinks, because people are looking for “jobs that AI can’t replace”.\n\nThat was certainly the case for Richard, a Northampton-based chartered occupational health and safety professional. After working his way up the career ladder for 15 years, the 39-year-old decided to jump ship and retrain as an electrical engineer.\n\n“Health and safety isn’t going to disappear any time soon because organisations can’t name AI as a responsible person or a duty holder for businesses legally,” he says. But a few years ago, he started to hear “mumblings of AI” within the industry, and saw organisations start to experiment with automating certain systems and procedures. He watched as AI began to be used for writing policies and safe systems of work, and realised that if a large portion of practitioners’ workload could be done by AI, then there might only be a need for “highly specialised managers. The rest of it’s probably going to go.”\n\nThough he decided to “pre-empt that” and pursue a different path, his main worry about AI taking over health and safety roles wasn’t actually that people like him would lose jobs – he finds aspects of AI “exciting” and accepts that it will inevitably shake up the way we work. His primary concern was that the implementation of AI might be “more of a cost-cutting exercise than it is about safety”. Richard cares deeply about the health and safety industry, which he entered after his friend was killed in a gas explosion at work.\n\nHe has taken “a huge cut” financially since he has been working as an electrical engineer over the past year, but his new job does at least still have keeping people safe at its core. And there is the potential to make the kind of money he earned in his old job once he has more experience under his belt, he says, but “I’m a good five, 10 years off”. And that’s if automation hasn’t come for electrical work by then – Richard mentions BMW’s testing of a humanoid robot as an example of how AI could affect trade jobs. Currently, though, the trades, in the UK at least, are “the most resilient to the levels of automation that AI is bringing in”, Richard believes. “Companies are capitalising on AI to remove one of their biggest costs, which is human overheads,” he says. “You need to pick something which has resilience. So, statistically, that is not your roles that are bureaucratic by nature, heavy in data and are just a bunch of processes which you repeat end on end. It needs to be something with high dexterity and some high problem-solving skills.”\n\nCarl Benedikt Frey, an associate professor of AI and work at the Oxford Internet Institute, agrees that manual work “is going to be harder to automate”, but predicts that AI will have an impact “across a very wide range of industries” – trades included. “If the dishwasher breaks down in my home, I can take a picture and I can quiz the large language model of my choice, and I’m more likely to be able to fix it myself these days without calling an engineer,” he says. That’s not to say tradespeople are “doomed” – he cautions against making too many decisions based on “some hypothetical future scenario … We have to go by what’s actually happening in the labour market.” Which, now, is not a lot. “We’re beginning to see some studies suggesting more of an impact on entry-level work,” Frey says, but a reduction in entry-level job opportunities could also be attributed to higher interest rates, or post-pandemic recovery, he says.\n\n“As AI gets better, and its capabilities improve, I think it’s likely that we will see it on a bigger slice of the labour market. But we’re not seeing it yet.” In fact, Frey has now reassessed his earlier claim that 47% of roles were at risk of being replaced by computerisation, made in The Future of Employment, the 2013 paper he co-authored with Prof Michael Osborne. “In that study, a lot of the jobs that we deem are highly exposed to automation are jobs in transportation and logistics because of autonomous vehicles,” he says. “It’s fair to say that it’s taken much longer for that technology to materialise.” As self-driving cars do begin to hit our streets, “we will see a lot of jobs being replaced in trucking and even in taxi services”, Frey believes. But his message seems to be don’t panic – at least not yet. “It might be a good idea if you are, say, in the early days of your professional career, to take the time that you still have to invest in training and figuring out other more viable career paths,” particularly if you work as a translator – one profession where “we’re already seeing that AI is having an impact, although we’re not seeing mass displacement by any means”. But if you are reaching the end of your working life, “you can probably ride the wave for a few more years”, he says.\n\nThe most significant AI-caused declines in employment and wages will be in jobs like software engineering and management consultancy, according to a King’s College London study published in October 2025. “That doesn’t necessarily mean that there aren’t going to be new jobs that will be created,” Dr Bouke Klein Teeselink, who authored that study, notes. Historically, whenever there have been technological advances people have worried about mass unemployment, but it hasn’t happened, he says. “So there’s a part of me that is a little bit sceptical that all the jobs will disappear, but at the same time there is a reason to think that this technology might be different, in the sense that humans always maintained some type of absolute advantage over technology in certain domains. And that may no longer be true.”\n\nFor now, while we can’t yet know the full impact AI will have on workers, “becoming really good at working with AI is probably going to be a skill that will pay off”, Klein advises. Which is what the Birmingham-based entrepreneurs Fayyaz Garda and Arun Singh Aujla, both 25, are attempting to do. Garda, who works in procurement, and Singh Aujla, who runs a social media marketing business, are in the process of setting up an AI consulting business, educating themselves about AI via YouTube. “It’s a growing market, and there’s definitely a space for it. So I’m hoping to try and get in there early,” Garda says. The plan is to employ a number of engineers to create AI systems that will answer phone calls, respond to mail and fulfil other tasks businesses need doing, he explains.\n\n“The AI consulting business is one way I’m upskilling to move with the times,” Singh Aujla adds. “AI won’t replace me, but it may take a large market share out of my business. So it’s always good to make an extra stream of revenue.” There are certain roles Singh Aujla would never replace with AI, though: “I would not replace my management team. You need that human interaction with your team,” he says. “But roles the team don’t want to do, like email outreach and cold calling, we can get AI agents to do that.”\n\nFor some, it may well prove true that AI improves their work life by removing tasks they find tedious or difficult, giving them more time to focus on the more fulfilling aspects of their job. For others, though, it is the reason they have given up on their dream career. Paola Adeitan, 31, had her heart set on being a solicitor, and obtained an undergraduate degree and a master’s in law. She had planned to do the legal practice course, the final stage of training needed to qualify as a solicitor, “but I decided not to pursue that path because I felt like, with the change in technology, the AI, that might not be a viable path for me to carry on with,” she says. Friends of hers had struggled to get entry-level law roles, which she believed to be partly due to the increased use of AI at law firms.\n\nAdeitan still volunteers as a legal adviser, but her day job is in the health sector – although even that role could be affected by AI, she thinks, so she is remaining open to the idea that she might end up retraining again. “I do feel a sense of disappointment,” she says, “but the nature of work is changing. It’s very difficult now to decide what you want to do; you have to think carefully. It’s not about what you want any more; it’s about what is going to be there, what’s going to work.”\n\nIf you’re lucky, what ends up working best could be something you really enjoy – as is the case for Faz, 23, who took a break from his geography degree at the University of Manchester in 2023 because of a family matter. Afterwards, it didn’t make sense to him to return to his degree. “I had to think about what was future-proof, I had to think about what was AI-proof. And it seemed like a lot of entry-level roles in the corporate sector were being taken over by AI. And because AI is so unpredictable, you never know if those more specialised roles will also become obsolete,” he says. So he has instead been training for a Level 2 qualification in electrical installation since September 2025. “I thoroughly enjoy it,” he says. Though he might go back to university at some point – his “ideal setup” would be a combination of working part-time for a council or a charity, while doing electrical work on the side – “right now, a tradie job is 100%, God willing, the correct choice. I’m fairly certain it will be future-proofed against AI.”\n\nBethan, 24, from Bristol, also enjoys her AI-proof job, working in a local cafe. But it comes at a cost: she has hypermobility spectrum disorder, which gives her severe joint pain and makes it hard for her to move around. “I can’t work long hours now because I’ve pushed my body past the point,” she says.\n\nBethan’s old job, at a university IT helpdesk, “was the first job that I didn’t come home in pain from”, she says. But only a couple of months after she was hired, she and her colleagues were told the helpdesk was being closed down and replaced with an AI kiosk. “It was awful,” she says. The helpdesk staff tried to defend their roles, arguing that for students who didn’t speak English as a first language, or older students who weren’t computer-literate, having humans behind the desk may still be necessary. “It felt like we were getting completely ignored. They went ahead with it because they said they had to get a certain number of cuts to the budget.”\n\nHospitality was the only other sector in which she had experience, so she ended up at her cafe job. “Feeling like I had to go back to hospitality, which was so bad for my body, was a horrible feeling,” she says. She is now on the lookout for an office job, but has struggled to find anything entry-level. “Those are the jobs that are vanishing because they’re the easiest to replace,” she says – but it also means it is impossible to get the experience needed for higher-up roles. Bethan worries that even if she does get an office job, she could lose it to AI again. “Is it worth all the effort of applying, getting my CV up to date, and potentially doing a couple of rounds of interviews just to find out at the end we’re going to be replaced again?”\n\nWith more physically demanding jobs making up the bulk of what is now considered “AI-proof”, those who have made the switch from white-collar roles are having to adapt to the toll it takes on their bodies. The electricians Richard works with are typically in their late teens and early 20s. “Their recovery rates are a hell of a lot quicker than mine. So if I pick up an injury, for example, it takes me far longer to recuperate. Also, they can work far longer hours than I can,” he says.\n\nAnd though Feenstra enjoys the physicality of working in a bakery, she has been thinking about how sustainable this kind of job will be as she gets older. “That’s why I’ve been taking note of how the owners run the business,” she says, in case there is a possibility of running her own bakery one day. She is proud of how she is continuing to adapt to the changing world around her: “I want my sons to feel a little bit inspired by that,” she says. Yet she doesn’t feel she can offer them career advice. “How am I supposed to advise them when I don’t even really know if what I’m doing is the right path?” she says. “It’s really unsettling when you can’t advise them. If they have a passion for something and they want to do something, immediately you think, OK, is this even going to exist in the next 10, 20 years? That just kind of sucks.”\n\nBallerinas will still exist, says Klein. “No one is going to go to the ballet to see a robot do really good ballet,” the academic says. “Same for theatre, same for football, same for many other things where it matters that there’s a human.” He doesn’t think people will be wanting to confess to robo-priests any time soon either, or leave children in the care of AI. “There are just categories where we prefer to interact with humans, right?” For that reason, social skills will remain important, Klein and Frey agree. And though it might seem as if AI could make expert knowledge useless, Klein disagrees. “I have students who use AI naively, and therefore they have no idea whether the reports they produce are good or bad,” he says. “You need to have that expertise to be able to guide the AI to get it to do what you need it to do. So in that sense, I think the value of expertise might actually go up.”\n\nHow such expertise will be developed, if entry-level jobs are being ditched in favour of AI systems, is a question that remains as yet unanswered, as is who will actually be able to buy a ticket to the ballet should large swathes of the population be put out of work. But Frey doesn’t think it is worth spending too much time worrying about that potential future – yet. “It could well arrive, but it matters a great deal if that happens in five years or 20.” While he acknowledges “there are reasons to be concerned”, Frey doesn’t think it’s time to “paint a scenario where everybody’s going to be out of work five years from now, and we need to rethink everything”.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — In China, consumerism appears to outweigh nationalism regardless of how testy relations have become in recent diplomatic spats with countries like Japan and the United States.\n\nIt has been common practice for the ruling Communist Party to whip up nationalist sentiment and deploy propaganda condemning countries deemed to be violating China's stance on territorial issues as Taiwan and Tibet. At times, Beijing targets companies that make ideological missteps in their maps or advertising.\n\nIn the past, friction with Japan and the United States has led to calls for mass boycotts, protests in the streets or even vandalism on embassies or restaurants. These days, pure nationalism appears not to resonate so much with Chinese consumers accustomed to making their own personal consumption choices.\n\n“Chinese consumers, especially urban middle-class and younger demographics, are not making everyday purchasing decisions based on nationalism,” said Jacob Cooke, CEO of Beijing-based consultancy WPIC Marketing + Technologies.\n\nJapan still sells despite tensions\n\nBeijing reacted with outrage to Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's comment, not long after she took office in October, that an attack on Taiwan, the self-ruled island China claims as its territory, might require a military intervention by Tokyo.\n\nChinese officials have condemned the remark and moved to restrict some trade with Japan. Warnings to Chinese travelers not to visit Japan, an ultra-popular destination, have had a notable impact on its tourism industry.\n\nBe that as it may, huge crowds turned up to the opening of an outlet of Sushiro at a Shanghai mall in December.\n\nThe Japan-based conveyor-belt sushi chain has become a smash success since it opened its first branch in mainland China in 2021.\n\n“It tastes good,” said Edith Xiao, a 23-year-old university student who lined up outside a Sushiro restaurant in a Beijing mall for more than half an hour to get in. “The quality of the ingredients is guaranteed.”\n\nXiao is also a fan of the Japanese manga and anime series Chiikawa, whose cherubic, hamster-like cartoon character is popular among Chinese.\n\nThe broader state of China-Japan relations has had little impact on her own consumption of Japanese culture or restaurants, she said.\n\n“It’s just statements made by leaders. It doesn’t represent a change in the attitude of people of the country,” she explained.\n\nAmerican culture appeals to Chinese consumers\n\nTensions between the Chinese and U.S. governments over tariffs, Taiwan and other issues also don’t appear to be causing Chinese to punish American brands.\n\nDisney’s Zootopia 2 is a huge hit in China, where its fans, many in cosplay of its characters, helped make it one of the biggest global cinematic hits of 2025.\n\nIt became the highest grossing Hollywood film in China on record with more than 4.4 billion yuan ($634 million) in revenue, according to Chinese entertainment data provider Beacon Pro.\n\nDespite a government push to promote and subsidize homegrown movies to make China a “strong film power” by 2035, Chinese film-goers say they welcome an escape into foreign cinematics.\n\nZootopia 2 was a light-hearted option, said Ruan Wenlin, who watched the movie in Beijing. “It was so hilarious,” she said.\n\nMany Chinese consumers are “tired, exhausted and anxious from COVID and from the weak economy,” said Shaun Rein, managing director at China Market Research Group. “People are watching Hollywood movies, especially cartoons like Zootopia, because they’re stressed out and just want something to relax themselves,” he said.\n\nRalph Lauren, the New York-based fashion brand, meanwhile has been building on its “old money” and quiet luxury aesthetic to win favor with urban middle-class Chinese who are prioritizing quality and value over nationalism, analysts say.\n\nAmerican fashions appeal to many, despite often fraught relations between Beijing and Washington. Ralph Lauren’s sales have grown faster in China than in Europe or North America.\n\n“What attracts me most is its stable brand image and design,” said Zhang Tianyu, who was shopping recently at a Ralph Lauren outlet in Beijing.\n\nAmerican brands that are succeeding are doing so because they genuinely meet consumer needs or represent a lifestyle Chinese consumers want to associate with, not because of country-of-origin alone, said Cooke from WPIC Marketing + Technologies.\n\nEvolving patterns as ‘patriotic buying’ trend shifts\n\nAs a wave of patriotic buying of Chinese brands — dubbed “guochao,” or national tide in Chinese — has evolved and matured, many consumers have grown comfortable with both foreign and domestic brands.\n\n“Chinese (people) have stopped buying just for the sake of buying Chinese brands,\" said Rein from China Market Research Group. Consumers are “scared about the economy, they’re anxious about their job prospects. So they’ll just buy whatever brand, domestic, Chinese or foreign, fits their definition of value and lifestyle,” he said.\n\nCompared with a decade ago, nationalist sentiment has less influence on consumer behavior, analysts said.\n\nIn 2012, Chinese crowds gathered for anti-Japan protests over a territorial dispute, smashed Japanese brand cars and vandalized Japanese restaurants. There were calls to shun Japanese goods.\n\nLikewise in 2021, Western brands including Nike were hit with boycotts in China due to disputes over political issues such as Beijing's treatment of members of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, in the country's far west.\n\nMore recently, controversies like a Pokemon card game event that was originally planned to be held at a shrine to honor Japan’s war dead still triggered angry comments on Chinese social media, but no obvious broader repercussions.\n\n“We may believe that all Chinese consumers should follow Beijing’s direction of discarding foreign influence, which is misleading,” said Yaling Jiang, an independent Chinese consumer analyst. “Geopolitics does not dictate business flows on the local level.”\n\nShoppers often will just mix and match to suit their own tastes, Jiang said.\n\nThe ascent of strong Chinese brands has emerged as a key challenge for foreign companies. From electric vehicles to smart phones to athletic wear, local companies are fast gaining market share both at home and abroad.\n\n“Chinese will choose Chinese brands because they’re better, better value, better quality, better pricing,” said Rein.\n\nAfter the government declared that travelers should avoid trips to Japan, employees of state-owned companies and government agencies, as well as travel agencies, fell in line. Hundreds of flights operated by China’s major state-owned airlines, and Japan-bound group tours, were cancelled.\n\nThe number of Chinese visitors to Japan fell 45% in December from a year earlier, to about 330,400. Many Chinese are still traveling to Japan individually, despite earlier warnings from officials, often while keeping a low-profile on social media.\n\nAP’s Beijing newsroom contributed to this story.",

    "description": "An Australian scientist says he has figured out the leading cause of the Bermuda Triangle disappearances. Here's the answer.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nAn Australian scientist says probabilities are the leading cause of the Bermuda Triangle disappearances.\n\nAdd in suspect weather, and iffy plane and boat piloting, and Karl Kruszelnicki believes there’s no reason to believe in the Bermuda Triangle phenomenon.\n\nWhile the conspiracy of the Bermuda Triangle has existed for decades, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association and Lloyd’s of London has long championed the same ideas.\n\nPick any one of the more than 50 ships or 20 planes that have disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle in the last century. Each one has a story without an ending, leading to a litany of conspiracy theories about the disappearances in the area, marked roughly by Florida, Bermuda, and the Greater Antilles.\n\nAustralian scientist Karl Kruszelnicki doesn’t Neither does the United States’ own National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA). Both have been saying for years that there’s really no Bermuda Triangle mystery. In fact, the loss and disappearance of ships and planes is a mere fact of probabilities.\n\n“There is no evidence that mysterious disappearances occur with any greater frequency in the Bermuda Triangle than in any other large, well-traveled area of the ocean,” NOAA wrote in 2010.\n\nAnd since 2017, Kruszelnicki has been saying the same thing. He told The Independent that the transparent volume of traffic—in a tricky area to navigate, no less—shows “the number [of ships and planes] that go missing in the Bermuda Triangle is the same as anywhere in the world on a percentage basis.” He says that both Lloyd’s of London and the U.S. Coast Guard support that idea. In fact, as The Independent notes, Lloyd’s of London has had this same theory since the 1970s.\n\nNOAA says environmental considerations can explain away most of the Bermuda Triangle disappearances, highlighting the Gulf Stream’s tendency towards violent changes in weather, the number of islands in the Caribbean Sea offering a complicated navigation adventure, and evidence that suggests the Bermuda Triangle may cause a magnetic compass to point to true north instead of magnetic north, causing for confusion in wayfinding.\n\n“The U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard contend that there are no supernatural explanations for disasters at sea,” NOAA says. “Their experience suggests that the combined forces of nature and human fallibility outdo even the most incredulous science fiction.”\n\nKruszelnicki has routinely garnered public attention for espousing these very thoughts on the Bermuda Triangle, first in 2017 and then again in 2022 before resurfacing once more in 2023. Throughout it all, he’s stuck to the same idea: the numbers don’t lie.\n\nEven with some high-profile disappearances—such as Flight 19, a group of five U.S. Navy TBM Avenger torpedo bombers lost in 1945—pushing the theory into popular culture, Kruszelnicki points out that every instance contains a degree of poor weather or likely human error (or both, as in the case of Flight 19) as the true culprit.\n\nBut culture clings to Bermuda Triangle conspiracy theories. The concepts of sea monsters, aliens, and even the entirety of Atlantis dropping to the ocean floor—those are fodder for books, television, and movies. It sure does sound more exciting than poor weather and mathematical probabilities, anyway, even if the “boring” story holds more water.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito has offered a cryptic observation about his former colleague and mentor, the late conservative justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nScalia, who was appointed to the bench in 1986 and became one of its most influential conservative members, died unexpectedly in his sleep at age 79, in early 2016.\n\nAfter his death, Alito—who has served on the Supreme Court since 2006—continued Scalia’s judicial legacy by authoring the Dobbs v. Jackson decision overturning the constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nHis decision drew heavily from dissents that Scalia had authored in previous cases upholding the right to an abortion, Alito told journalist and author James Rosen in a new interview published in Politico.\n\nBut while Scalia would have no doubt been happy that the court now boasts an entrenched 6-3 conservative majority, he would have been less enthusiastic about the state of American politics, which have grown “coarser and more polarized than ever before,” Rosen wrote.\n\n“He would have been appalled at so much,” Alito told Rosen.\n\nThe 75-year-old did not elaborate, though he apparently agreed with one of Scalia’s children that the timing of the justice’s death meant he was spared from witnessing “so much that would have upset him,” as Rosen put it.\n\nA few months after Scalia died, President Donald Trump was named the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nTrump went on to win the general election in November and appoint Scalia’s successor, Neil Gorsuch, after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell kept the seat vacant for more than a year in order to prevent President Barack Obama from filling it.\n\nSince then, the court has been rocked by a series of scandals, including Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s disastrous confirmation hearings in 2018, during which Christine Blasey Ford accused him of sexual assault, which he denied.\n\nA few years later, in 2022, a draft version of Alito’s decision in Dobbs was leaked to Politico. If the leak came up during Rosen’s 90-minute interview with Alito, the author didn’t mention it.\n\nSubsequent leaks have revealed disagreements among the justices, including a bitter debate over the court’s toothless ethics rules, and a confidential memo in which Chief Justice John Roberts pushed to grant Trump broad immunity from prosecution.\n\nThe court is also facing record-low public trust as Alito and the other conservative justices have greenlit the vast majority of Trump’s policies, while the justices themselves face unprecedented security risks.\n\n“Even since Nino died, things are so different,” Alito told Rosen, using a nickname for Scalia reserved for close friends and family. “I so often wish he were still here. He started so much and it would have been good to have him around to see it to completion.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the Supreme Court for comment.",

    "fullText": "The US Food and Drug Administration has refused to accept an application from Moderna to review its first mRNA seasonal flu vaccine, the company said Tuesday, in another setback for the technology that’s been a target of some Trump administration health officials.\n\nThe agency told Moderna that its application didn’t contain an “adequate and well-controlled” trial because the control arm didn’t reflect the “best-available standard of care in the United States at the time of the study,” according to a letter dated February 3 that Moderna posted online. It didn’t identify any safety or efficacy concerns, the company said.\n\nModerna said that the refusal was inconsistent with previous feedback from the agency and that it had requested a meeting with FDA officials to understand how to proceed.\n\n“The complete stunner here is at no point in any of this did anybody say that it was not adequate” to run its clinical trial the way it had discussed with the agency, Moderna’s president, Dr. Stephen Hoge, told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services said “the FDA generally does not comment on regulatory communications to individual sponsors.” It’s rare for the FDA to issue a “refuse-to-file” letter; a 2021 study of almost 2,500 applications submitted to the agency found that only 4% received such letters.\n\nModerna used a standard-dose seasonal flu vaccine called Fluarix as a comparator in a 40,700-person clinical trial to demonstrate the experimental mRNA vaccine’s safety and efficacy. The company said the FDA had agreed with that plan in April 2024 but suggested it also include data comparing its vaccine with an approved high-dose flu vaccine for people over 65, which the company said it did.\n\nModerna added that as recently as August, in a meeting before it submitted its application for approval of the vaccine, the FDA suggested that it would review the filing and assess issues with the comparator during that process. The agency did note that there could be a “significant issue” with the data “during review” of the application, according to written feedback that Moderna shared.\n\nBut last week, the agency refused to do the review at all, according to the letter. It was signed by Dr. Vinay Prasad, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which oversees vaccine regulation.\n\nPrasad was an outspoken critic of the government’s response to Covid-19 before he was appointed to the FDA under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He claimed late last year without providing details that Covid-19 vaccines resulted in deaths of 10 children and has said the agency will change its vaccine approval process.\n\nModerna is one of three manufacturers in the US of approved Covid-19 vaccines, along with Pfizer and Novavax. Moderna and Pfizer’s vaccines use mRNA technology. Pfizer also has mRNA-based flu vaccines in development.\n\nAlthough the record-speed development of mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccines during the pandemic was a chief accomplishment of Trump’s first term, his second administration has withdrawn support for mRNA technology in infectious diseases. HHS canceled 22 projects worth about $500 million focused on mRNA vaccine development in August, claiming against evidence that “these vaccines fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu.”\n\nCovid-19 vaccines are estimated to have saved millions of lives. The hope behind applying mRNA technology to seasonal flu vaccines is that it could improve how well they work, enable tailoring for geographic regions where different strains are circulating and lead to combinations with Covid-19 vaccines so people would need only one shot for protection against both viruses.\n\nWith currently approved technology, experts select flu strains for each fall’s seasonal vaccines during the preceding February. Hoge pointed out that mRNA vaccines can be manufactured much faster; for Covid-19 vaccines, he said, the design is decided in May or June, for shipping by August.\n\nChoosing the strains closer to the start of flu season could potentially lead to a better match with circulating viruses, “and better matching equals, usually, better protection,” Hoge said.\n\nModerna’s phase 3 study showed in results reported in June that the mRNA-based flu shot produced efficacy that was about 27% higher than Fluarix in adults 50 and older. A separate trial that assessed safety and immune response included the comparison with a high-dose flu vaccine for people 65 and older and showed superiority, Moderna said.\n\nImmune response is assessed in the laboratory by analyzing blood samples of people who’ve been vaccinated, while efficacy assessments typically involve seeing how well a vaccine protects against cases of the disease.\n\nModerna had been awaiting the start of the review of its flu shot before it moved its experimental combination flu and Covid-19 mRNA vaccine into the FDA review process, Hoge said. That’s now on hold as the company awaits a meeting and further guidance from the agency.\n\nMeanwhile, the combination vaccine is moving forward in other countries.\n\n“We do expect that our first approval will be … probably in Europe, and this year,” Hoge said. “So that’ll be a milestone event.”",

Harris introduced a bill that could let utility companies to build and operate power-generation infrastructure. (Photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)\n\nSen. Kevin Harris is not sure his bill allowing investor-owned utilities to get back in the business of generating power — and using ratepayer dollars to do so — is the answer to high energy prices and constrained demand in the state.\n\nBut the Prince George’s County Democrat is sure that something needs to be done.\n\n“We need to have all possible options out there for the state of Maryland. Who knows if this is the right one, but we won’t know until we actually do the deep dive, have the discussions and figure out what’s best for our constituents,” said Harris of Senate Bill 954 that he is sponsoring.\n\nThe bill, which lays out a pathway for investor-owned electric utilities to use ratepayer dollars to build power generation infrastructure in Maryland, has the support of Exelon — the owner of Baltimore Gas & Electric, Delmarva Power and Pepco. The Chicago-based utility has been campaigning hard for the idea, including in TV commercials that aired in Maryland during the Super Bowl.\n\nBut consumer advocates and environmental groups argue that putting additional costs on the backs of customers would be deeply harmful amid already-high costs. They warn that high infrastructure spending by utilities is part of the reason for the current high rates, and allowing further construction would make matters worse.\n\nMaryland People’s Counsel David Lapp, who is tasked with representing utility ratepayers in the state, said in a statement that he believes “the Exelon bill is anything but affordable.”\n\n“Turning new business over to Exelon unnecessarily exposes customers to the Exelon utilities’ long record of exceeding cost projections and of cost overruns,” Lapp said.\n\nIn Maryland, the utilities, which control the distribution of power to homes and businesses across the state, are separate from the companies that generate power and supply it to the grid.\n\nThe utilities enjoy monopolies in their service territories and are regulated by the Public Service Commission, which presides over the costs they can pass on to customers. Utilities receive reimbursement of approved infrastructure costs, and a guaranteed profit on top of that, often 9% or higher.\n\nCurrent law technically states that the PSC “may require or allow investor-owned electric company to construct, acquire, or lease, and operate, its own generating facilities … subject to appropriate cost recovery.”\n\nHarris’ bill is considerably more specific.\n\nThe bill directs the PSC to require one or more electric companies to submit plans involving power generation, if it determines that there is a power scarcity, or that an event impacting “price stability” has occurred. The commission then has one year to approve or deny the plans.\n\nHarris said that his bill, called the Affordable Energy Act, would only allow the utilities to build renewable energy projects, but not fossil fuel projects.\n\nValencia McClure, senior vice president of government, regulatory and external affairs for Exelon’s Maryland utilities, said her company wants to focus on operating community solar farms and battery storage infrastructure, not natural gas generation. She noted that power customers who \n\n“We really are focusing on: How can we support our customers during this affordability crisis?” McClure said. “The way to do that is to — if called upon by the state — to be able to build new generation.”\n\nBut Lapp said Maryland consumers should not be paying for any increased power generation in the state through their rates, since much of the predicted strain on the regional grid isn’t actually coming from Maryland. It’s largely coming from data centers projected for other states, he said.\n\nHouse caps amount of utility employee salaries that can come out of ratepayers’ pockets\n\n“PJM projects that the Maryland Exelon utilities’ power demands decrease — not increase — through 2029.” Lapp wrote. “Aside from some relatively small data center growth in Maryland compared to PJM — growth that existing customers should not be responsible for — the Exelon utilities’ energy demands only go up modestly starting in 2030, at a growth rate much lower than historical growth rates.”\n\nHarris’ bill explicitly states that the electric utilities required or authorized to construct power facilities can recover all of their costs from ratepayers — even if some of those costs are stranded, including if the infrastructure is never built.\n\n“That’s one of the things that we would be discussing further and see what is actually needed and what is not needed,” Harris said.\n\nLapp argues that the provision is alarming.\n\n“It would give utilities unprecedented statutory protection from the consequences of building power plants that turn out to be unnecessary — a real possibility given the vast evidence suggesting that projections of data center energy demands are inflated,” Lapp wrote.\n\nIn a statement, BGE spokesperson Nick Alexopulos said the company supports the measure “to make sure a large generation project doesn’t jeopardize the utility’s health or lead to higher debt costs overall, which would adversely impact customers.”\n\nIt’s unclear whether the bill will be able to advance: Senate President Bill Ferguson said Tuesday that “there is a level of skepticism that exists across the caucus, and across the Senate membership” about whether it will reduce ratepayer costs.\n\n“That’s going to be the lens that we are really trying to hone in on, is whether or not a policy is going to provide long-term savings for the ratepayer,” Ferguson said.\n\nMcClure said Exelon estimates that average customer bills would increase about $2 per month for a few years, but those would turn to savings of $5 to $10 a month in the future. The company’s analysis was based on construction of 2,700 megawatts of battery storage and 1,200 megawatts of solar.\n\nFerguson said that he would “prefer that that the risk” of investment “land with investors.”\n\nSUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE\n\n“But there is a question that if there is a strike price or point where … the market is not generating sufficient domestic generation, whether that has to be some other market intervention to push it,” Ferguson said.\n\nLast year, lawmakers passed the Next Generation Energy Act, which included a fast-track permitting process for “dispatchable” energy projects, which can provide energy for the grid when called upon during peak times. Only two projects have been approved to move through the fast-track, under the legislation’s requirements: Two different concepts for a natural gas plant in Harford County, submitted by Constellation.\n\nConstellation, formerly an Exelon subsidiary, also proposed a battery storage project, but it did not meet requirements of the fast-track bill, even though it created a procurement specifically for battery storage.\n\nConstellation has been opposed to Exelon’s push to enter the generation game, arguing that it would crowd out competitive power producers, and that Exelon is ill-suited to enter the generation fray.\n\n“BGE doesn’t need new law to build new generation,” said Constellation spokesman Paul Adams. “BGE wants new law to guarantee a return on any investment, whether or not that investment is in the best interests of Maryland ratepayers or at the lowest cost. Unlike them, Constellation is ready and willing to put our own capital on the line, with no guarantee of profit. It seems only reasonable that if you aren’t willing to take on any risk, you should take no profit.”",

    "fullText": "(Removes 'downtown' from paragraph 2)\n\nWASHINGTON, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Becky Ringstrom was heading home after following federal immigration officers in her gray Kia SUV in suburban Minneapolis when she was suddenly boxed in by unmarked vehicles. At least a half-dozen masked agents jumped out to arrest her, one knocking on her windshield with a metal object as if threatening to use it to break her window.\n\nAfter the arrest, captured on bystander video verified by Reuters, the 42-year-old mother of seven later said she was transported to Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis where an officer gave her a citation charging her under a ​federal law that criminalizes impeding law enforcement. The official said her name and photo would be added to a government database.\n\nThe arrest of Ringstrom became the latest detention of one of thousands of local activists for violating Title 18, Section 111 of the U.S. Code, a catch-all charge for anyone who “forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes” ‌with a federal officer conducting official duties. The statute can be charged as a felony or misdemeanor. As a felony, it carries up to 20 years in prison, but penalties beyond eight years are reserved for people who use “a deadly or dangerous weapon” or cause an injury.\n\nA Reuters review of federal court records found that the Trump administration has prosecuted at least 655 people under that charge across the U.S. since a series of city-focused immigration crackdowns began last summer. ‌That’s more than double the prosecutions during the same period in 2024-2025, according to a review of publicly available criminal filings in Westlaw, a legal research database owned by Thomson Reuters.\n\nThe charges are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to clamp down on ICE opponents, who they portray as rioters who pose threats to officers and undermine their efforts to arrest immigrants with criminal records.\n\n\"Assaulting and obstructing law enforcement is a felony,\" said U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin. She said federal immigration officers \"used the minimum amount of force necessary to protect themselves, the public, and federal property.\"\n\nICE has been tracking the names of protesters in an internal database for several months, according to two U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss operations.\n\nThe government database contains names, photos, actions that provoked suspicion, locations and license plates, the officials said, adding that the effort was intended to spot patterns that could lead to charges.\n\nDHS said ⁠it does not maintain a database of U.S. “domestic terrorists,” but does track threats. “We do of course monitor and investigate and refer all ‌threats, assaults and obstruction of our officers to the appropriate law enforcement,” McLaughlin said.\n\nOne of the officials said ICE was referring several people per day in Minnesota alone to federal prosecutors for potential charges under the same law for interfering with police operations.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said the Trump administration was committed to protecting First Amendment freedoms, but that people impeding law enforcement \"will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nRingstrom had watched federal immigration officers for about 45 minutes as they sat in a parked car in her neighborhood on Thursday, January 29. When they started to ‍move, she decided to follow along in her SUV, keeping a distance of multiple car lengths behind, she said.\n\nAt a roundabout, a Border Patrol agent approached her car and said, \"Last time I'm going to warn you,\" according to video Ringstrom recorded on her phone.\n\nThe officers went right at a stop sign and she went left, she said. Several minutes later as she started to head back toward her house, multiple vehicles with federal officers stopped and arrested her, she said.\n\n\"I know what I'm doing is not wrong,\" Ringstrom said later in an interview with Reuters.\n\nStill, she said she was terrified when federal officers approached her car. “There was a moment where I thought I could be Renee Good,\" she said, referring to one of the two U.S. citizen protesters fatally shot by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis in January.\n\nAfter her arrest, she was issued a citation, reviewed by Reuters, ​which said the court date was “TBD” - to be determined.\n\nMcLaughlin said Ringstrom \"stalked law enforcement and attempted to obstruct law enforcement from performing their sworn duties.”\n\nSeth Stoughton, a professor focused on policing at University of South Carolina School of Law, said the law in the past mostly has been used to charge assaults on officers and specifically states that the alleged crime must be committed \"forcibly.”\n\n\"Without ‌any physical contact, just following an agent in a car, it's not clear to me that that's resistance or impeding in the first place, and it certainly seems like a stretch to establish that as forcible,\" Stoughton said.\n\nA federal judge in Minneapolis said in a mid-January order that a vehicle following ICE at “an appropriate distance” did not justify a traffic stop or arrest, but that order was paused by an appeals court 10 days later.\n\nThe judge’s now-paused order did not say what exact distance would be deemed safe.\n\nDeborah Fleischaker, a top ICE official under former President Joe Biden, said it was “inappropriate and unconstitutional” to intimidate and arrest people peacefully following immigration officers in their cars.\n\n“Observing ICE activities is not a crime and should not be treated as such,” she said.\n\nMcLaughlin said U.S. Border Patrol agents at the scene gave Ringstrom \"lawful commands and warnings\" but that she continued to obstruct operations, leading to her arrest.\n\n\"When agitators willingly involve themselves and inject themselves in law enforcement operations, they are risking arrest as well as jeopardizing the safety of themselves and those around them,\" McLaughlin said.\n\nVIDEOS SHOW ICE OFFICERS DRAWING WEAPONS\n\nWhile new internal ICE guidance, reported by Reuters in late January, instructed officers not to engage with protesters, the encounters have not stopped.\n\nTwo videos in recent weeks verified by Reuters showed ICE officers drawing their weapons as they approached vehicles that allegedly had been following them.\n\nSouth of Minneapolis on January 29, the same day Ringstrom was arrested, federal immigration officers abruptly swerved, stopped their vehicle and approached a woman driving behind them with guns drawn, according to dashcam footage ⁠from her vehicle first reported by Minnesota Public Radio and verified by Reuters.\n\nMcLaughlin said ICE officers were attempting to arrest a criminal offender when the woman began “stalking and obstructing” them, leading the officers to try to arrest ​her.\n\n“Law enforcement officers attempted to pull her over using their emergency lights to issue her a warning,” McLaughlin said. “Ignoring law enforcement commands, the agitator refused to pull over and began driving recklessly including running stop signs, nearly colliding with ​multiple vehicles, and driving directly at law enforcement in an attempt to ram their vehicle.”\n\nIn a separate incident on February 3, two ICE officers approached a car that had been following them, again, with guns drawn, according to video verified by Reuters and a DHS statement.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the vehicle had been “stalking” and “obstructing” ICE officers.\n\n“The agitators then followed the officers as they departed and made hand motions suggestive of possessing a firearm,” DHS said.\n\nUnder Trump, numerous DHS statements after violent encounters with immigration agents have been inaccurate ⁠or incomplete.\n\nSome Minnesota residents say they believe they are becoming the subject of an intimidation campaign.\n\nIn a suburb north of St. Paul on January 22, an ICE officer led a woman who was following his vehicle back to her house, making it clear that he knew her identity and address, Reuters-verified video filmed by the husband showed.\n\nThe woman’s husband spoke to the ICE officer outside of the couple’s house. When the husband questioned the tactic, the officer said, “You raise your voice, I erase your voice,” the video showed.\n\nOne ICE officer told Reuters they have led people following them back to their houses after running their license plates “to freak them out.”\n\nMcLaughlin said ICE would review body camera ⁠footage and investigate the incident in St. Paul, but did not comment on ICE using the tactic to frighten opponents.\n\nEarlier in January, two friends - Brandon Siguenza and Patty O’Keefe - who were following an ICE vehicle in Minneapolis said officers fired pepper spray into their car, smashed their car window and detained them for eight hours.\n\nMcLaughlin said officers gave them multiple warnings “to stop impeding” operations, but that they “chose to continue to stalk law enforcement and were arrested.”\n\n“The passenger refused to roll ‌down the window and exit the vehicle,” McLaughlin said. “ICE law enforcement followed their training and used the minimum amount of force necessary to make the arrest.”\n\nMcLaughlin did not explicitly confirm that officers broke the car window or deployed pepper spray.\n\nSiguenza and O’Keefe have not been charged.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorney General Pam Bondi will face questions from lawmakers Wednesday over the Justice Department's handling of files related to Jeffrey Epstein that have exposed sensitive private information about victims despite redaction efforts.\n\nBondi is confronting a new wave of criticism stemming from the political saga that has dogged her term after the release of millions of additional Epstein disclosures that victims have slammed as sloppy and incomplete.\n\nIt will be the first time the attorney general appears before Congress since a tumultuous hearing in October in which she repeatedly deflected questions and countered Democrats' criticism of her actions with her own political attacks.\n\nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee are expected to grill Bondi on how the Justice Department decided what should and should not be made public under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which was passed by Congress after the department abruptly announced in July that no more files would be released even though it had raised the hopes of conservative influencers and conspiracy theorists.\n\nBondi has continuously struggled to move past the backlash over her handling of the Epstein files since distributing binders to a group of social media influencers at the White House last February. The binders included no new revelations about Epstein, leading to even more calls from President Donald Trump’s base for the files to be released.\n\nThe hearing comes days after some lawmakers visited a Justice Department office to look through unredacted versions of the files. As part of an arrangement with the Justice Department, lawmakers were given access to the over 3 million released files in a reading room with four computers and were allowed to take handwritten notes.\n\nDemocrats have accused the Justice Department of redacting information that should have been made public, including information that could lead to scrutiny of Epstein’s associates. Meanwhile, victims have slammed the department for inconsistent or nonexistent redactions that allowed for the inadvertent release of nude photos and other private information about victims.\n\nThe department has defended the latest rollout of more than 3 million pages of documents along with more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images. The Associated Press and other media organizations are still reviewing millions of pages of documents, many of them previously confidential.\n\nAn AP review of records shows that while investigators collected ample proof that Epstein sexually abused underage girls, they found scant evidence the well-connected financier led a sex trafficking ring serving powerful men. Videos and photos seized from Epstein’s homes in New York, Florida and the Virgin Islands didn’t depict victims being abused or implicate anyone else in his crimes, a prosecutor wrote in one 2025 memo.",

    "fullText": "Speaker Mike Johnson failed to reinstate a ban on lawmakers’ ability to challenge President Donald Trump’s tariffs when three Republicans crossed party lines to vote with Democrats.\n\nThe House sank a procedural vote on Tuesday that contained language blocking votes in the chamber that object to Trump’s tariffs through July. The move opens the door for Democrats to move forward with forcing votes to repeal Trump’s tariffs, in a blow to the administration.\n\nWith razor-thin margins in the House, three Republicans – GOP Reps. Thomas Massie, Don Bacon and Kevin Kiley – were enough to sink the vote. Johnson can only afford to lose one Republican vote to advance legislation with his current margin.\n\nThe Senate has passed at least three resolutions rebuking Trump’s tariffs, but routinely ran into resistance in the House where members were blocked from forcing votes on the matter.\n\nBacon said in a statement posted to X, “I don’t like putting the important work of the House on pause, but Congress needs to be able to debate on tariffs.”\n\nThe Nebraska congressman went on to say, “tariffs have been a ‘net negative’ for the economy and are a significant tax that American consumers, manufacturers, and farmers are paying. Article I of the Constitution places authority over taxes and tariffs with Congress for a reason, but for too long, we have handed that authority to the executive branch. It’s time for Congress to reclaim that responsibility.”\n\nGOP leaders had argued that lawmakers should allow the Supreme Court time to weigh in.\n\nSpeaker Johnson acknowledged the challenges he faces holding together his razor-thin majority after the failed vote.\n\n“Look, this is life with a small majority. I mean, you know, I need unanimity every day, and we didn’t get it tonight,” he told reporters.\n\n“The vast majority of the House Republicans agree wholeheartedly with the president, and we’re going to give him the latitude to continue his trade policy,” he said.",

    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks won Super Bowl 60 and so did NBC — but not by as much as they would have liked.\n\nAn average of 124.9 million people tuned in, per NBC Sports. NBC generated the second-most-watched Super Bowl — behind 2025's game on FOX Sports — in its broadcast of the Big Game. It ended a two-year streak of record-breaking Super Bowl viewership.\n\nTelemundo, however, delivered a record with the most-watched Super Bowl in US Spanish-language history with an average of 3.3 million viewers. That viewership peaked during Bad Bunny's halftime show performance, with 4.9 million viewers.\n\nOverall, viewership was an average of 128.2 million from 8:15 to 8:30 p.m. ET during Bad Bunny's performance.\n\nAn all-time record 137.8 million viewers watched across NBC, Peacock, and Telemundo during the second quarter, according to NBC Sports.\n\nA more detailed breakdown will be available from Nielsen later this week, NBC Sports said in its press release.\n\nMany major sporting events — including last year's Super Bowl — have seen their ratings increase since Nielsen changed its ratings calculation in late January 2025 to better account for out-of-home viewing, such as people watching at restaurants and bars.\n\nThe college football National Championship Game drew in just over 30 million people, up about 36% from last year's mark of 22.1 million and close to the all-time record of 33.9 million in 2015.\n\nUnder Nielsen's prior ratings methodology, this year's college football championship would have generated just over 28 million viewers. That's based on an ESPN spokesperson telling The Athletic that the game's ratings would have risen 27% year over year under the old format. In other words, out-of-home viewing appeared to add 2 million viewers to the game's total.\n\nSo while Nielsen's revamped viewership calculations may have affected Sunday's ratings, it might not have made a massive difference.",

After a day like today, my knitting needles are probably waiting for me.\"\n\nOgden's podium finish ended a five-decade Olympic medal drought for the US in men's cross-country skiing. The last medal came when fellow Vermonter Bill Koch won silver at the 1976 Innsbruck Games.\n\n\"It's an unbelievable dream come true,\" Ogden said. \"Everybody who races dreams of being on an Olympic podium. Last year I really dared to set my expectations on an Olympic medal. Every day in training I thought about how I could get better and be the best version of myself on this course.\"\n\nWhen the racing ends, Ogden turns to yarn and needles to decompress. At a press conference last week, Ogden said he even arranged for extra yarn to be shipped in during the Games so he wouldn't run out.\n\n\"I have gotten really into knitting recently. So far, I've knit a hat and a sweater this season. I'm really fired about it,\" he said, per Reuters. \"I brought all kinds of yarn. I actually ordered some, so hopefully it'll get here from Iceland.\"\n\nHe said his latest project is a pair of mittens featuring French historical figure Joan of Arc.\n\n\"For me, it's a pretty awesome way to just, like, relax. I really crave the ability to make things. That's something that I have when I'm home and I didn't have when I'm here until now,\" Ogden said.\n\nOgden isn't the only one on the US cross-country skiing team who enjoys knitting. His teammate, Jessie Diggins, also showed off a sweater she knitted on her Instagram in January.\n\nIt's not just a Winter Games pastime either — British diver Tom Daley went viral for knitting in the stands during the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n\"One thing that has kept me sane throughout this whole process is my love for knitting and crochet and all things stitching,\" Daley said in a 2021 Instagram post, adding that he picked up the hobby during the pandemic.",

    "fullText": "Wall Street may be getting the AI trade wrong, says Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst and longtime tech bull.\n\nIves said on CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" published Tuesday that the recent investor pessimism toward software companies is 'the most disconnected call that I've ever seen.\"\n\nWhile much of the AI excitement has centered on data centers, chips, and GPUs, Ives said software will be the \"heart and lungs of the AI revolution.\"\n\nThe infrastructure buildout is still in its early innings and could stretch over the next decade. But software is where the real use cases and monetization will emerge, he added.\n\nIves said it is wrong to assume that big software companies like Salesforce and ServiceNow are \"structurally broken\" or set to be replaced by AI-native tools.\n\nThese companies are deeply embedded in enterprise stacks, with hundreds of thousands of customers, Ives said, adding that their AI use cases could unlock incremental revenue over the next six to 18 months that investors are not yet pricing in.\n\nLarge, entrenched platforms should not be compared to smaller players that serve small and medium-sized businesses. \"You cannot paint all of them with the same brush,\" Ives said.\n\nIves also defended Microsoft's role in the AI revolution. While acknowledging near-term concerns around capital spending and Azure growth, Ives said the broader AI rollout cannot succeed without Microsoft's software and cloud ecosystem.\n\nIves' comments came after software stocks tumbled last week amid investor fears that AI could disrupt large swaths of the industry.\n\nNot all tech and finance leaders think AI will replace traditional software companies. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed that idea at a Cisco AI event last week.\n\n\"There's this notion that the tool industry is in decline and will be replaced by AI,\" Huang said. \"You could tell because there's a whole bunch of software companies whose stock prices are under a lot of pressure because somehow AI is going to replace them. It is the most illogical thing in the world and time will prove itself,\" he added.\n\nHuang said AI depends on the tools software offers and pointed to ServiceNow, SAP, Cadence, and Synopsis as examples of software firms well-positioned in the AI era.\n\nIves also wrote in an industry note published last week that the \"software armageddon\" can be regarded as a tech stock \"garage sale.\"\n\n\"We believe the market is baking in a doomsday scenario for software companies in the near-term, which we believe is extremely overblown, as many customers won't be willing to put their data at risk to capitalize on AI implementation strategies until there is less risk with these migration projects,\" Ives and his analysts wrote.\n\nIves has long urged investors to buy tech dips, even as critics caution that AI enthusiasm may be running ahead of earnings and real-world adoption.",

    "description": "Central bank buying has driven gold's surge, but similar \"insurance\"-type strategies are now spreading across other commodity markets, Goldman says.",
    "fullText": "Gold's historic rally isn't just about precious metals. It's part of a broader shift in how governments and investors are treating commodities, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nCentral bank buying has helped drive gold's surge in recent years as governments seek to hedge geopolitical and financial risks. Now, similar \"insurance\"-style strategies are emerging across other commodity markets, analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note on Tuesday.\n\n\"As some of these risk-management policies have taken hold, some commodity markets appear to be transitioning — at least temporarily — from a single, global balance toward more regionally segmented systems, raising the risk of higher volatility,\" they wrote.\n\nThat shift stems from recent supply shocks.\n\nAfter 2020's supply-chain disruptions and 2022's food and energy shocks, policymakers focused on securing access to critical materials, Goldman's analysts wrote.\n\nThat has included tariffs, export controls, support for domestic production, and the buildup of government stockpiles.\n\nTogether, those measures are reshaping commodity markets in ways that can make prices more sensitive to shocks.\n\nGoldman pointed to copper as an early example. Despite expectations of a global oversupply in 2025, prices surged as US stockpiling pulled material out of international markets. That left markets outside the US, where global benchmark prices are largely set, tighter.\n\nThe dynamic isn't limited to governments.\n\n\"Recent client feedback suggests that insurance-type demand for several commodities — not only gold but also industrial metals such as copper — has broadened beyond the public sector, as private sector investors turn to hard assets for diversification in an uncertain global policy environment,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nThose investor flows are supporting metals prices and amplifying volatility.\n\nFor most commodities, supply can adjust when prices rise. Producers often ramp up output, helping cool price spikes driven by \"insurance\" demand.\n\nBut policies aimed at making supply more secure can also encourage overproduction. That can push prices lower, drive out smaller producers, and leave supply more concentrated, increasing the risk of future disruptions and sharp price swings.\n\nGold, however, remains structurally different.\n\nNearly all the gold ever mined still exists above ground, and annual supply is relatively stable and slow to respond to price moves, the Goldman analysts wrote. That means demand driven by risk concerns can keep pushing gold prices higher for longer.\n\nSpot gold was trading around $5,500 per troy ounce early Wednesday. Prices are up about 16% this year amid volatile trading.\n\nGold hit a record high above $5,500 per ounce on January 29 before plunging a day later, with the yellow metal falling more than 10% to below $5,000 per ounce.",

    "title": "Power banks, body warmers, and antifreeze: Ukrainian troops tell us how they survive deep winter out in the trenches",
    "description": "For Ukrainian infantry and drone teams, the extreme cold brings new challenges to modern war in the trenches.",
    "fullText": "For Ukrainian infantry, surviving the dead of winter requires a delicate balance.\n\n\"It's really, really cold in Ukraine,\" said Nefor, the chief sergeant of an infantry company in Ukraine's 3rd Army Corps. \"I think, the first winter in some time with such cold weather.\"\n\nA cold snap whipped through much of Ukraine last week, delivering frigid temperatures that sank to -6°F on some nights in the northeastern region of Kharkiv, where Nefor's corps is fighting.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to him and another Ukrainian commander, who oversees a drone company on the front lines, to discuss what it takes to hold a trench position in such weather. Trench warfare, largely glossed over in the last few decades, has seen a resurgence in interest from militaries around the world, especially those in Europe, watching Russia's plodding invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNefor, who spoke on the condition that he only be identified by his callsign, is in charge of assigning infantry rotations to their frontline positions.\n\nWhile holding a position, a key item each soldier needs is chemical body warmers, which can be slipped under their uniforms, said Nefor.\n\n\"You put this warmer against your body, and your blood circulating is warm. It works, not bad,\" Nefor said. \"If you want to rest a little bit, you take a chemical warmer, a sleeping bag, and it's faster.\"\n\nAt such temperatures, frostbite can easily set in within 30 minutes, so troops constantly need the warmers, he said. One typically lasts six to eight hours, meaning a soldier needs at least three warmers per day, Nefor added.\n\nHis company experimented with electrically powered warmers. But they come with a risk — anyone who gets too warm would be more easily spotted by thermal optics, especially since their surroundings are much colder than usual.\n\nChemical warmers, conversely, emit such small heat signatures that light drones won't be able to spot them, Nefor said.\n\n\"It's possible to see if the Russian guy has a 'teplevizor' on his weapon, but it's a very small signature,\" the sergeant said, referring to thermal imagery attachments for small arms.\n\nSerhii Andrieiev, a senior lieutenant who is second-in-command of the \"Kraken\" drone company in the 3rd Army Corps, said his pilots prioritize camouflage for their nests during the winter. In the colder seasons, there is less forest foliage to provide visual cover.\n\nThe heat signature from the motors on their drones is easier to spot, and only \"very happy drone operators\" have the luxury of stationing in a building along the Kharkiv frontline, Andrieiev said.\n\n\"In most cases, it's a big foxhole, or a cellar in a destroyed building,\" the deputy commander said.\n\nAppliances such as electric warmers also soak up significant energy and require a power source in the trenches.\n\nNefor said his company deploys roughly 20 EcoFlow portable batteries, but there aren't enough to cover all its frontline positions. The batteries are also needed to power screens and radios, he added.\n\nAlmost all soldiers instead carry personal power banks to keep their devices charged. \"It's the power bank you buy at the shop,\" Nefor said. \"Power banks with Type-C or USB ports.\"\n\nCold temperatures can grow even more dangerous when they alternate between above and below freezing. Clothes, especially in humid areas, can absorb thawed water that can then freeze again, increasing the risk of hypothermia.\n\n\"If you are not dry, you die,\" Nefor said. \"We have this saying.\"\n\nClothing that gets wet in the winter stays wet, so troops who need dry layers have to request new ones from their commanders.\n\nUncrewed ground vehicles have recently been a major boon for Nefor's company in this regard, freeing up human soldiers by carrying weeks' worth of ammunition, clothing, and other supplies such as food, water, and chemical warmers to the trenches.\n\nFirearms and ammunition can become waterlogged as well. Nefor said that his troops, worried that their weapons would freeze up, apply a lubricating concoction to their rifles that mostly includes vehicle oil and sometimes a small amount of antifreeze.\n\n\"You need to make one, two shots with your weapon to make it warmer, then you add it,\" Nefor said.\n\nBoth commanders said the deep winter adds to the mental toll on Ukraine's already-beset troops, who are often short on reinforcements and the grinding nature of the war.\n\nNefor's company sends smaller groups of two or three soldiers — no more than four — to each position to avoid detection from Russian drones. Each soldier takes turns for several hours in the trenches between watch positions, which are typically colder, and warmer resting locations.\n\nAndrieiev said that if he had more drone pilots, he could rotate them out of the front lines every four or five days. His teams instead spend two to three weeks at a time in the forests.\n\n\"It's exhausting to spend all that time in freezing temperatures. Even if you have heaters with you,\" Andrieiev said.\n\nTroops need more fuel and more clothes to perform their duties, he said. A task as simple as using an improvised bathroom in the trenches is stressful, with the soldier under threat from Russian drones while wearing multiple layers, body armor, and carrying their military gear.\n\nThe Russian assaults they have to fight off, meanwhile, stay just as frequent and intense during cold weeks, Andrieiev said.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what the weather is. They come at us like zombies, two or three guys at a time in the middle of the frozen field,\" he said.",

In compliance with US sanctions, SpaceX doesn't do business with Russia, but Ukraine has repeatedly said that Russian troops were obtaining terminals and using them to guide attack and reconnaissance drones.\n\nIn its latest statement, the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said that officials could trace the registration of terminals that were later used by Russian forces because enrollment requires an ID.\n\n\"If the terminal is used to control drones that destroy infrastructure and take lives, the fact of registering the terminal by a citizen of Ukraine is grounds for criminal prosecution,\" the agency added.\n\nRussia is not known to have a satellite internet service that compares to Starlink's in terms of speed, availability, and stability.\n\n\"For the enemy, Starlink is so important that they have deployed a whole network to search for traitors who are ready to register Starlink for themselves in the Central Administrative Service,\" wrote Serhii \"Flash\" Beskrestnov, a drone analyst and an advisor to Ukraine's defense ministry, in a Telegram statement on Sunday.\n\nIn some cases, Russian troops were offering up to $230 to register a single terminal, Beskrestnov added. That's roughly a third of the median monthly salary in Ukraine.\n\nFor the Kremlin's forces, the service disruption has been significant enough that pro-Russian military bloggers have reported that most Russian units now lack internet access. Some have blamed Moscow for what they called a reliance on Western technology, even as the US and Europe explicitly back Ukraine.\n\n\"It's about to suddenly become clear that units cannot operate effectively without communications. That'll be news to some in high places,\" one blogger, under the handle Belarusian Silovik, wrote.\n\nDenying Russian access to Starlink had long been a priority for Ukraine's new defense minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, who had previously advocated such measures while serving as minister for digital transformation.",

    "description": "Marriott ended its partnership with Sonder in November, and Sonder filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy soon after.",
    "fullText": "The Sonder fiasco cost Marriott millions.\n\nOn a Tuesday earnings call, Marriott's outgoing finance chief, Leeny Oberg, said Marriott incurred a $23 million loss from terminating its contract with the luxury short-term rental company Sonder in November.\n\nA Tuesday earnings report said the $23 million in charges came from termination expenses and the write-down of Marriott's licensing agreement with Sonder. Oberg added that it was a one-time expense.\n\nThere were no other mentions in the earnings call of any fallout Marriott experienced because of the termination.\n\nIn November, Marriott made headlines for giving its guests staying at Sonder properties short notice to vacate. Affected guests that Business Insider spoke to said they scrambled to find alternative accommodations at exorbitant costs, and had their vacations ruined by the experience.\n\nGuests also described Marriott flip-flopping on its refund policy. The hotel chain initially assured guests who had booked Sonder properties through Marriott's channels that they would get a full refund. A few days later, the guests were instructed to approach their credit card companies for refunds.\n\nSonder workers described the chaos and confusion of the messy breakup to Business Insider, saying they found out from the news that they would be losing their jobs.\n\nShortly afterward, Sonder, a onetime Airbnb rival founded in 2014, filed for Chapter 7 liquidation proceedings in a Delaware federal bankruptcy court. Its stock price crashed.\n\nDespite the hit from Sonder's termination, Marriott reported strong financial results in the latest quarter.\n\nIt reported its latest quarter revenue of $6.69 billion, a 4% increase compared to the same period the year before. Its revenue per available room increased 1.9% year on year. It had about 610,000 available rooms as of the end of December, per the Tuesday earnings report.\n\nThe company's stock increased about 8.5% after earnings were announced on Tuesday. It's up 18% in the past year.\n\nRepresentatives for Marriott did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Robin Cousins says Britons Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson need to be \"flawless\" to win an Olympic medal on Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "As we debriefed Monday's action, I asked former Olympic figure skating champion Robin Cousins what Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson need to do to win an ice dance medal at the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nAfter a brief pause, he gave a concise answer: \"They have to be flawless.\"\n\nFear and Gibson - aiming to be the first Britons since Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean in 1994 to win an Olympic figure skating medal - are in fourth place after the rhythm dance.\n\nIn the first half of the ice dance competition at Milan-Cortina, they performed to their popular Spice Girls mix - but could not match the season-best score they secured in the team event three days earlier.\n\nFear, 26, lost her balance slightly at one point, but she and her partner recovered well to keep themselves firmly in the hunt for a podium finish.\n\nTheir score of 84.57 points left them 0.71 behind third-placed Canadian duo Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier going into Wednesday's free dance, when the medals will be decided.\n\nGold and silver are probably out of reach. France's Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron lead with a huge 90.18. World champions and pre-event favourites Madison Chock and Evan Bates, who have already won gold in the team event for the US, are in second on 89.72.\n\nBut bronze remains within grasp for Fear and Gibson.\n\nThe 'Disco Brits' are the darlings of British figure skating - as was evident at last month's European Championships in Sheffield.\n\nYou could have your photo taken on the arena concourse with a pleasure-beach style cut-out - your face on the bodies of Fear and Gibson.\n\nTheir Spice Girls-themed routine drew applause from the band's official account on Instagram.\n\nThere were even misty-eyed stories of how the last time the European Figure Skating Championships were held in Sheffield in 2012, Fear was a flower girl.\n\nBut amid all the glitz and hype, the hard truth is that while they are definitely good enough for a medal, this is such a competitive field that any error is costly.\n\nFear and Gibson won bronze in Sheffield, but it could - maybe should - have been more. In just the second element of nine in their free routine, Gibson slipped slightly into the synchronised twizzles, and gold was gone.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nFear and Gibson are used to overcoming the odds.\n\nIn a discipline in which many partnerships are competing together by their mid-teens, theirs is an unusual story.\n\nFear and 31-year-old Gibson first trained together in Montreal in 2016. Fear was a junior ice dancer but Gibson new to the discipline. He had only taken up skating aged 11, before switching to ice dance at 21.\n\nBut in their first season together, they won the British title - and Cousins thinks their differences from the norm are their greatest strengths.\n\n\"They don't have a history, meaning unlike some of the couples they are competing with they came together late in their careers,\" Cousins, who won men's figure skating gold in 1980, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"That gave it an edge. There was no time to play catch-up and it worked - they found a niche in the way they perform compared to everyone else. People love them and how they perform.\n\n\"To have it so clean and proficient takes time, and it is time they have not had. They are trying to mould themselves and hone the bladework which others have had a lot more time doing.\n\n\"But the possibility is fantastic for them. If I were to speak to them, it would be to say that what other people think of you is none of your business.\"\n\nFear and Gibson's uniqueness is present in their routines.\n\nAs well as the Spice Girls compilation, their free programme is a tribute to Gibson's Scottish roots with a mix of The Bonnie Banks of Loch Lomond, Auld Lang Syne, and The Proclaimers hit I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles). They worked with highland dance experts to perfect the choreography.\n\n\"They're the hits!\" Fear said of their musical tastes. \"We started the season with a slower middle, but we changed it to an upbeat piece - they are crowd favourites.\"\n\nThey are also not afraid to go against the figure skating mould off the ice.\n\nGibson, who is gay, said at the Europeans that he would like to see same-sex partnerships allowed on the international stage in his event - adding his voice to a growing movement in favour of the change.\n\nOn the ice, they still have momentum. Since finishing 10th at Beijing 2022, Fear and Gibson have won the first World Championship medal for Great Britain in more than 40 years, were ranked first by the ISU after the 2024-25 season and have won continental medals at every opportunity.\n\nSo, to Wednesday, and the hope they will bring their very best at the moment they have trained for all this time.\n\n\"There is an amazing confidence,\" said Cousins. \"It is not arrogance, it is confidence, they carry that on to the ice when others don't.\n\n\"The visibility is great, but to know how hard they have worked in the last few years - all we hope is that they step off the ice in Milan happy. What the judges decide to do is up to them.\n\n\"There is a chance [of a medal] - they must do their best and hope for the best.\"\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "Chelsea 2-2 Leeds: Palmer missed an open goal in the 94th minute as Rosenior fell to his first real upset as Blues boss",
    "fullText": "Cole Palmer’s face said it all. His mouth agasp in utter disbelief, the 94th-minute open-goal miss of the weekend’s hat-trick hero perhaps signalled the end of Liam Rosenior’s honeymoon period. And once more, it’s against Leeds United when fortunes change for a Chelsea manager.\n\nBefore the visit of Daniel Farke’s men, Rosenior’s early career at the Stamford Bridge helm consisted of seven wins in nine games, only suffering defeat in Chelsea’s two Carabao Cup semi-final legs against quadruple-chasing Arsenal. His impressive record had admittedly been aided by a favourable run of league fixtures, with his only top-half opponents coming in the form of Brentford in mid-January. But considering the backlash from a portion of the fanbase following his appointment, alarm bells were yet to really sound on BlueCo’s pick.\n\nDropped points against Leeds, however, could be the reality check that shifts the tide, as was the case in December. The visitors’ dismantling of Chelsea in this season’s reverse fixture plunged a club with a growing ambition of a title charge into turmoil. Defeat at Elland Road, eight days on from a stunning 3-0 win over Barcelona, can be seen as the turning point that led to Enzo Maresca’s messy demise. A month and two wins in seven games later, the Italian was sacked.\n\nChelsea were overrun in that contest, falling victim to a blistering start by Daniel Farke’s side as they fell behind inside six minutes. There was a brief sense the same was about to happen when Jayden Bogle, bizarrely playing in a second striker role rather than his usual wing-back position, found himself in the Blues box inside 60 seconds, a break stemming from Cole Palmer giving the ball away cheaply. Without Dominic Calvert-Lewin in support, who lost his race to make fitness, Bogle ended up running the ball out of play, but it was an early glimmer of hope for the visitors.\n\nThat glimmer was swiftly snuffed out as Chelsea grew increasingly comfortable. Leeds became camped in their own half as the hosts pressed and probed, who found the breakthrough in the 24th minute thanks to a scything Chelsea move, cutely finished by Joao Pedro after being slipped in by Palmer.\n\nThat’s eight goal contributions in his last nine outings for the Brazilian, who had seen his star fade after an electric start to his Chelsea career. The instant impact he made in New Jersey last summer, lighting up the latter stages of the Club World Cup before carrying that form into the opening weeks of the season, led many to tip him as the Premier League’s signing of the season. He is now rediscovering the potency that justified that initial hype.\n\nThe roles of Chelsea goalscorer and provider were swapped after the break, in a way. Jaka Bijol gifted the Blues a penalty in the 56th minute, pushing Joao Pedro in the back with both hands to send the striker tumbling over. The Slovene’s appeals were pointless - it was stonewall. And off the back of his first-half hat-trick at Molineux - including two converted spot-kicks - there was no mistake from Palmer, tucking past Karl Darlow to double his side’s lead.\n\nChelsea were cruising, with Rosenior looking on course for an fourth straight league win. The new Blues boss has so far looked impermeable to an upset - but then the wheels came off.\n\nJust as it seemed a clumsy challenge down one end had put the game out of sight for Leeds, a clumsy challenge down the other end offered the visitors a way back. Moises Caicedo’s tripping of Bogle gave referee John Brooks another simple decision to make, and Lukas Nmecha - deputising for Calvert-Lewin - sent Robert Sanchez the wrong way.\n\nSix minutes later, things weren’t so black and white for the referee. Noah Okafor tucked into an open net after a calamitous mix-up between Sanchez and Josh Acheampong, who failed to clear the ball after Bogle had forced himself into the box. It seemed, however, that Chelsea’s sinners would get a reprieve, with replays showing the ball to have touched Bogle’s arm in the build-up.\n\nA delay ensued - not as long as we’ve seen in the recent past, but one significant enough for home fans to believe a jog to the monitor was imminent. But that didn’t come; the goal was given. Leeds were resurrected, Chelsea crestfallen.\n\nFarke’s side still had a quarter of an hour to survive as Chelsea upped the ante, but while taking no credit away from their defensive reslience, there was a sense it just wouldn’t fall for the hosts now that they’d surrendering total control.\n\nJoao Pedro was nearly the hero as his late header crashed off the bar, but it’s Palmer who will have sleepless nights after skying a last-gasp chance with the goal gaping from a couple of yards out. Caicedo, who must have thought he’d set up a late winner when squaring it across the six-yard box, could not quite believe his talisman hadn’t scored as he looked lifelessly into the Matthew Harding Stand.\n\nPalmer was crouched, dejected, before the full-time whistle even went, with Leeds winding down the final seconds of the clock. For Farke’s side, it’s another point towards survival.\n\nChampions League qualification remains paramount for the Blues and this result on its own will not harm them too much, with sixth-placed Liverpool going into the matchweek four points adrift. But as we saw at the tail-end of 2025, things can snowball and fast. Just ask Rosenior’s predecessor.",

    "fullText": "Meet Browns new Special Teams Coordinator Byron Storer: 3 things to know originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Cleveland Browns have hired a coordinator…no not on defense to replace Jim Schwartz, but on special teams.\n\nNew head coach Todd Monken is adding Byron Storer to lead the unit in place of the embattled Bubba Ventrone.\n\nLet’s be honest, Cleveland’s third phase was a nightmare in 2025. According to official 2025 team statistics, the Browns ranked dead last (32nd) in punt return yards allowed and 31st in yards per kick return. To put it bluntly, the \"un\"special teams were a liability that cost the team games.\n\nComing over from Green Bay as the assistant special teams coach, can Storer turn the tide? Here are the three most important things to know about the man tasked with fixing the mess.\n\nMore: Browns DC search: Albert Breer names new 'leader' to replace Jim Schwartz\n\n1. He is a \"Special Teams Royalty\" Disciple\n\nStorer is the hand-picked protege of Rich Bisaccia, arguably the greatest special teams mind in the modern NFL. Storer has been Bisaccia’s \"right-hand man\" for nearly a decade, following him from the Buccaneers, to the Raiders, to the Packers. He’s helped modernize Bisaccia’s legendary playbook, meaning the Browns are getting a cutting-edge system with a proven pedigree.\n\nIf you want explosive returns, Storer is your guy. During his time in Green Bay (2022–2025), he was instrumental in coaching Keisean Nixon to back-to-back First-Team All-Pro honors. He also helped tutor Raiders punter AJ Cole and kicker Daniel Carlson into All-Pro status. Storer’s record of elevating individual talent to the highest level is just what this Browns squad needs.\n\n3. He’s a Former Player with a \"Grinder\" Mentality\n\nStorer isn't just a clipboard carrier; he played three seasons as a fullback and special teams \"ace\" for the Buccaneers. His career ended early due to injury. He brings a \"players-first\" energy to the locker room that should resonate with a Browns roster looking for a fresh start.\n\nReplacing David Njoku: Top 3 Browns TE free agent targets\n\nBrowns 32nd?! 3 reasons ESPN's 2026 power rankings are way off for Cleveland\n\nBrowns draft shock: The Athletic’s 3-round mock includes a wild QB move\n\nMyles Garrett sends reality check to Shedeur Sanders: 'He's got to earn it'\n\nBust to boom: Do the Browns already have the ‘next Sam Darnold’ on the roster?",

    "description": "Maxim Naumov's score Tuesday was enough to make it through the short program, giving him another opportunity to perform when the men's free skate takes place Friday night.",
    "fullText": "U.S. figure skater Maxim Naumov carried the memory of his late parents with him to the Olympics on Tuesday night, delivering an emotional, heartfelt short program at the Milan Cortina Games that fulfilled a dream they had long shared together.\n\nHis parents, former pairs world champions Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, were among the 67 people killed — more than two dozen of them members of the figure skating community — when American Airlines Flight 5342 crashed into a military helicopter on approach to Ronald Reagan National Airport and fell into the icy Potomac River on Jan. 29, 2025.\n\nOne of the last conversations Naumov had with his parents was about what it would take to make the Olympics.\n\n\"I've been inspired by them since day 1, ever since we stepped on the ice together,\" said Naumov, who brought an old photograph of that moment to the kiss-and-cry at the Milano Ice Skating Arena, the little tyke standing between his parents as he stepped foot on the ice for the first time, the three of them all smiling for the camera.\n\n\"It's not necessarily thinking about them specifically,\" Naumov said, \"but their presence. Feeling their presence. With every glide and step that I made on the ice, I couldn't help but feel their support, almost like a chess piece on a chess board.\"\n\nWhat made one of the feel-good stories of the Winter Games even more special was the performance.\n\nWhile a long shot to make the top 10 at the Olympics, much less land on the podium, the 24-year-old Naumov nevertheless had one of the best short programs of his career. He opened with a quad salchow as his godmother, Gretta Bogdan, watched from the stands, and he followed up with a triple axel and a triple lutz-triple toe loop to finish out the program.\n\nAs the last notes of \"Nocturne No. 20\" by Frederic Chopin reverberated through the arena, and the crowd rose to its feet, Naumov slid to a stop on his knees and looked to the sky, telling his parents: \"Look at what we've done.\"\n\n\"I didn't know if I was going to cry, smile or laugh,\" he said afterward, \"and all I could do was look up at them. And man, I still can't believe what just happened. I think it's going to take me a few hours or maybe a few weeks to know.\"\n\nHis score of 85.65 was enough to make it through the short program, giving him another opportunity to perform when the men's free skate takes place Friday night.\n\nThe plane carrying Naumov's parents also had aboard 11 young skaters, two other coaches and several family members who had been attending a development camp in Wichita, Kansas, following the 2025 national championships.\n\nNaumov's parents were coaches at the Skating Club of Boston, which lost six members in the midair crash.\n\nNaumov had flown out earlier, shortly after he had finished in fourth place for the third consecutive year.\n\n\"I can't describe how difficult it was at the very beginning, and through month after month of really just trying my hardest to keep a positive mindset, and focus on day to day, thankfully, skating became a tool that actually helped me overcome that,\" Naumov told CBS News Boston last month during his Olympic training at the Skating Club.\n\nThe idea of fulfilling the Olympic dream he harbored with his parents pushed him on. And when he finished third at the U.S. championships in January, his spot was all-but secured.\n\n\"To be honest,\" Naumov said Tuesday night, \"I wasn't thinking about executing anything perfectly or anything like that. I wanted to go out there and just give my heart out. Leave everything out there. Have no regrets. And that's exactly what I felt.\"\n\n\"To deal with the tragedy that he's dealt with, and like he said, get up and do the day. And that's what he's done. He's done one day at a time,\" Katharine Steeger, the skating club's director of membership services, told CBS Boston. \"To have Max start us off with such an amazing skate for him, it's just, there's really no words.\"\n\nThis marks the first time since 2014 that the Skating Club of Boston has sent athletes to the Olympics. Along with Naumov, they also sent figure skating pair Emily Chan and Spencer Akira Howe.\n\nIn the crowd Tuesday, dozens of American flags waved when Naumov's program came to a conclusion. At one end of the arena, a fan held up a big flag that read, \"Tomorrow's Champions,\" and carried the logo of the Skating Club of Boston — \"Tomorrow's Champions\" is the name of the skating school there that his parents founded and Naumov now oversees.\n\n\"From the time that my name was announced in the warm-up to right before the skate,\" Naumov said, \"I felt it — just the crowd, the energy, the roar. It's like a buzz, you know? In your body. I couldn't help but just embrace it. Embrace that love.\"\n\nDetails on new images of subject in Nancy Guthrie disappearance\n\nMore details emerge on whistleblower complaint against Tulsi Gabbard\n\nTrump criticizes Super Bowl halftime show, calling it \"one of the worst\"",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills have brought back an old quarterback friend.\n\nShane Buechele is going to spend another offseason with the Bills.\n\nAccording to The Athletic's Joe Buscaglia, the Bills have signed Buechele back to their roster. It's a reserve/futures contract that allows Buechele to spend the offseason program with Buffalo.\n\nBuechele spent most of this season on the Bills' practice squad.\n\nBut after the Kansas City Chiefs lost Patrick Mahomes and Gardner Minshew to injury, they signed Buechele to their active roster to be the backup to Chris Oladokun.\n\nIn Week 18, Buechele came on in relief of Oladokun. It was his regular season NFL debut. He completed 7-of-14 passes.\n\nMORE: The latest on Travis Kelce's retirement timeline\n\nThe Chiefs cut Buechele after their season ended, though, which was likely always the plan. They just needed him for the late-season insurance after already being eliminated from the playoffs.\n\nBuechele did then return to the Bills' practice squad in the playoffs. But a practice squad player becomes a free agent as soon as the season ends.\n\nThat did give Buechele a chance, if he wanted, to sign elsewhere.\n\nBut he knows the QB room in Buffalo, with offensive coordinator Joe Brady now promoted to head coach, and he's got a good relationship with Josh Allen.\n\nThat makes it very logical to keep Buechele around. No reason to mess with the vibes in the depths of the quarterbacks on the roster.\n\nBuechele likely will never start a regular season game of consequence for the Bills, but he's not bad to have around.\n\nDerek Carr shocks NFL world with retirement comeback news\n\nThe Steelers' first ever draft pick was named William Shakespeare\n\nThe Patriots might have a Will Campbell problem\n\nDay off after the Super Bowl is coming sooner than you think\n\nDrake Maye was 'seeing ghosts' in the Super Bowl\n\nJahvid Best has traveled a cool journey since the NFL",

    "fullText": "The United States have a lot of star power at the Olympic Winter Games in Milan. They include Mikaela Shiffrin, Jordan Stolz, Lindsey Vonn, Chloe Kim, and Ilya Malinin. However, on Tuesday, it was the American supporting cast that came away with Olympic hardware, and in the process made names for themselves that will bring them temporary fame.\n\nJacqueline Wiles and Paula Moltzan\n\nHeading into the slalom portion of the women’s team alpine combined, Breezy Johnson and Mikaela Shiffrin were the heavy favourites, as they were the defending world champions and even had the lead as Johnson was the fastest women’s downhill skier of the event. However, it was Shiffrin who had a poor slalom run, and the Johnson/Shiffrin tandem shockingly finished in fourth place. The Americans still got on to the podium in the event as Jacqueline Wiles of Portland, Oregon and Paula Moltzan of Lakeville, Minnesota posted a third place time of 2:21.91 to beat Shiffrin and Johnson by six one-hundredths of a second.\n\nWhat we saw on Tuesday was a gigantic upset from American cross country skier Ben Ogden of Lebanon, New Hampshire. The odds of Ogden coming through with a medal was +6500 according to 3wiresports.com. However, it was Ogden that had the second fastest time in the men’s sprint, and was only behind the heavy favourite, Johannes Hesflot Klaebo of Norway. For Klaebo, it was his second Olympic gold in Milan, as he also was first in Saturday’s skiathlon.\n\nThe mixed doubles curling event came to completion on Tuesday, with the United States winning silver behind only Sweden. It ws a notable week for American curler Cory Thiesse of Duluth, Minnesota. Thiesse became the very first American female curler to win an Olympic medal. The only other American medal in Olympic curling came in 2018, when John Shuster of Duluth shocked the curling world with a win over Sweden in the gold medal final in the men’s event.\n\nThe native of Fairbanks, Alaska is now a two-time Olympic medalist in slopestyle. After winning gold four years ago in Beijing, Alex Hall won silver on Tuesday at the Livigno Snow Park. Hall had a score of 85.75 points, and was beaten by the slimmest of margins–0.53 points. The gold medalist was Norway’s Birk Ruud, the Olympic gold medalist from men’a big air skiing in Beijing.\n\nIt has been a tough time for the Sacramento Kings over the last month, as the Kings are losers of 13 straight games. However, Olympic bronze medalist Ashley Farquharson calls Sacramento home and was marvelous on Tuesday as she claimed an unexpected bronze in the women’s luge event. Faquharson had a four run time of 3:31.582.\n\nThe post 2026 Winter Olympic Games: five medal Tuesday for Team USA appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "A season like no other for Bucheon ended in glory at Castle Park. For the first time ever, Bucheon FC 1995 are a K League 1 club, and given the upcoming changes to Korean domestic football at the end of 2026, this is arguably the best season ever to go up.\n\n*Defeated Suwon FC 4-2 on aggregate in the playoffs.\n\nBucheon FC are no strangers to playoff football in K League 2, having suffered more heartbreak than any other club. That is no longer the case. Two swashbuckling performances against Suwon FC saw them win the promotion decider and finally advance to K League 1. Don’t be fooled by the 4–2 aggregate scoreline — this was more comprehensive than that. What makes it even more astonishing is that Bucheon finished 8th in 2024.\n\nThe campaign began well before stuttering, as happens, in the middle third. Despite a couple of rollercoaster spells, it ended with a remarkably consistent finish. As their main rivals for third dropped points late on, Bucheon suffered just one defeat in ten. When I visited the club during this run, their confidence was striking. With two months still to play, they were already calling their destiny.\n\nIt helped having one of the league’s best foreign players in Rodrigo Bassani (14 goals, six assists), alongside the most destructive young midfielder in Park Hyun-bin. Park formed a formidable partnership with Japanese midfielder Takahashi Kazuki, creating an almost indestructible shield in front of the three-man defence. At the same time, Bucheon were also slaying K League 1 opposition en route to the Korea Cup semi-finals.\n\nWas Lee Young-min robbed of the Manager of the Year award?\n\nIncredibly, Lee Young-min did not win the K League 2 Manager of the Year award, which instead went to Incheon’s Yoon Jung-hwan. Yoon won the title with a K League 1-calibre squad containing several internationals. Lee, by contrast, improved Bucheon’s points total by 18, climbed five places, secured promotion, and reached the last four of the cup. It was nothing short of sensational.\n\nPark’s departure from Bucheon to Suwon is a hammer blow for the club. Still only 22, Park looks like a future captain and national team defensive midfielder in waiting. After joining from Incheon United, he became a mainstay in Bucheon’s midfield, amassing 62 appearances, mostly starts. His disciplinary record shows a player who loves to get stuck in. Park was a destructive force in front of the central defence, thwarting attacks and tidying up. A huge loss.\n\nYoon Bit-garam at pre-season training.\n\nFormer Korean international midfielder Yoon signed on a free transfer from Suwon FC over the winter break. It is unlikely Yoon will be a direct replacement for Park, but a player of his quality, experience, and popularity will always be valuable. Yoon made his league debut back in 2010 for Gyeongnam FC and has since enjoyed spells at Jeju SK, Ulsan, Seongnam, and Suwon FC, as well as a sojourn in China.\n\nWith much of the focus on Bassani, John Montaño flew under the radar for Bucheon in 2025. Twelve goals is a decent return for the Colombian, and he will lead the line in the first division. However, depth is important, and that’s where Vitor Gabriel fits in. The Brazilian joins from Gangwon FC, where his four goals in 27 appearances didn’t exactly strike fear into opponents. He will be a valuable asset off the bench as K League crams in a lot of football ahead of the World Cup. Vitor Gabriel will always be a legend at Gangwon for keeping them up in 2023.\n\nPatrick spent last season in J1 with Kyoto Sanga and arrives in Bucheon on a free transfer. In total, the Brazilian (he’ll feel right at home in K League 2) represented Kyoto 17 times, but only six were starts, and none since May. In fact, his last outing was back in July. Like Vitor, Patrick will be a squad player — but that’s exactly what Bucheon need now. The step up in class will be enormous.\n\nBassani has prior K League 1 experience after an unhappy spell at Suwon Bluewings. That 2023 season ended in relegation, but he briefly gave Suwon hope by scoring the winner away to FC Seoul in the penultimate round. It ultimately proved futile, and Bassani departed soon after for Bucheon. He now returns to the top flight a very different player.\n\nAt 28, Bassani is in the prime of his career. He captained Bucheon throughout the season, underlining his leadership and importance. The club’s focal point, he thrives on responsibility. While his left foot remains the best in the league — making him deadly from set pieces — he has also evolved into a consistent goal threat from open play. His playoff performance against Suwon FC, particularly in the second leg, was a masterclass that should be compulsory viewing for young players nationwide.\n\nWill Kim Kyu-min get to shine in K League 1?\n\nLocal lad Kim Kyu-min takes over from Park Hyun-bin as the young player to watch. The 22-year-old winger saw plenty of action last season, playing 30 times and scoring his only goal in a vital 1–0 away win over Ansan Greeners. If you want to know how highly the club rate him, consider that he started matches on the left wing against both Incheon United and Suwon Bluewings last term. The right-footed winger usually plays on the left flank, using his pace to beat defenders before cutting inside onto his favoured right foot.\n\nThis is arguably the best season ever to be promoted to K League 1. Structural changes at the end of the campaign — most notably the expansion from 12 to 14 teams — mean Bucheon cannot be automatically relegated. Only Gimcheon Sangmu are guaranteed to go down, regardless of their finish, due to the expiry of their agreement with Gimcheon City. Even a 12th-place finish would still offer Bucheon a playoff lifeline.\n\nAs a result, some pressure is eased. That said, the club will want to make an immediate impression and secure survival early, much like Anyang did in 2025. Another small-budget, city-owned club enjoying top-flight football for the first time, Anyang relied on smart recruitment and an experienced squad. For Bucheon, the priority is clear: turn Bucheon Stadium into a fortress. Two temporary pitchside stands have already been installed, and full houses should follow.\n\nMaximising points at home and grinding out draws against fellow strugglers will go a long way toward survival. But Bucheon should also allow themselves to dream. Anyang beat defending champions Ulsan HD away on opening day, took four points from FC Seoul, and thrashed Gimcheon Sangmu in October. If Bucheon can replicate even part of that, they will more than justify their place.\n\nFor consecutive seasons, K League 1 welcomes a brand-new club. Yet Bucheon’s history adds extra spice. Yukong Elephants, later Bucheon SK, once played in the top flight before abruptly relocating to Jeju in early 2006. Bucheon fans understandably still resent Jeju, in a saga eerily reminiscent of the Anyang–FC Seoul split.\n\nMeetings between the two promise intensity. Despite their size, Jeju have only been relegated once, while competitive fixtures between the clubs have been rare. Bucheon did eliminate Jeju from the 2025 Korea Cup, however, and the rematch arrives on Saturday, September 12. With both sides likely near the bottom, bragging rights — and vital points in the relegation fight — will be firmly on the line.",

    "description": "A recent report confirms what has been reported for weeks. The Bears will not receive comp picks for Ian Cunningham leaving to be Atlanta’s GM.",
    "fullText": "According to Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk, who emailed the NFL for confirmation, the Chicago Bears will not receive compensatory draft picks for losing assistant general manager Ian Cunningham to the Atlanta Falcons, where he will serve as their general manager.\n\n“The policy for receiving picks pertains to the head coach or the primary football executive,” the NFL told PFT on Tuesday via email. “The primary football executive position was filled by Matt Ryan.”\n\nThis was the expectation all along, since Matt Ryan was hired to be the Falcons’ president of football, a position Cunningham also interviewed for. Had Cunningham been hired for that job, which is Atlanta’s primary football executive, then the Bears would have been awarded two third-round draft picks by virtue of the Rooney Rule.\n\nWhat brought this subject up again was Ryan’s recent declaration that Cunningham will take the lead on roster decisions.\n\nAfter being asked if he would be actively involved in the draft and free agency, Ryan said, “Ian is in charge of that space.” Ryan went on to say that he’s looking forward to learning about the draft process because he’s never even sat in a draft meeting, and that he “has a lot to learn.“\n\nHe reiterated that Cunningham is “driving this boat, and he’s the one that’s leading us moving forward,” but Ryan will be involved and helping out in any way he can. “This is Ian’s regular season right now; he is in it, and he is driving the ship for us.”\n\nEvery team has a primary and a secondary football executive position on file with the league, and no matter what that’s called from team to team, or what the responsibilities for each of those are, there’s no getting around the 1-2 front office hierarchy that each franchise has set up.",

    "description": "Phins fans share their thoughts and concerns with the team under the new leadership.",
    "fullText": "This past week, I asked the following question:\n\nNow that our Miami Dolphins have hired the new GM and nearly filled out the entire coaching staff, what concerns do you still have about either or both? Is it an individual coach that you believe could hold the team back, or is there another concern about the new makeup of the front office or the coaching staff as a whole? Or…maybe you think this is nearly perfect for what we want to see. Please let us know that and why as well.\n\nBelow are some of your thoughts and answers-\n\nLuvs2drnk just hopes this isn’t a case of wash-rinse-repeat.\n\nMy only concern right now is that we’re doing the same thing we’ve been doing for the past 21 years and expecting a different result.\n\ncoluccim knows that being mediocre is not acceptable.\n\nSame concern as before – the acceptance of mediocracy\n\nMiamiItaliano is concerned about the dire financial situation the team is in, cap-wise, due to horrible decisions made by the previous regime.\n\nThe concern is how Sully can build a team with so much dead money against the cap. It’s already at $35 million, before the 2 post-June 1st cuts. Assuming it’s Tua, that’s $67 million this season. Assuming it’s Chubb, that’s $10.9 million. Then there’s Tyreek, who’s probably getting cut ASAP with no post-June 1st designation. That’s $28.2 million dead cap. A total of $142 million of money the Dolphins can’t use this year. That means Sully has to absolutely nail the draft every year until they get out of cap hell.\n\nTheRoo1 hopes that the new regime sticks to the long game this time.\n\nConcerns? That while Sully and Haf have said the right things, now that they have the keys to the car, they decide to take a joy ride, and stray from the long game that they talked about.\n\nUSMCFinzFreak hopes the new guys aren’t just fill-ins for now.\n\nMy concern is if the staff is just a bridge staff, considering the cap space hell they inherited. I hope not, but we fans are impatient (and rightly so), especially after so many decades of mediocrity. We’ve been on an endless search to find our franchise quarterback, so I hope we can get out of quarterback purgatory soon, but first, the team needs to build a formidable OL before we bring in a QB. Chicken or egg, which one comes first? Sorry for the ramble……\n\nSlayerNation1 is concerned about the culture and if the owners’ priorities are in the right place.\n\nThe concern until proven otherwise: the “Dolphins’ Culture” overwhelms/brainwashes any regimes ability to break through the “Glass Ceiling of Mediocrity”\n\nIf the Dolphins were an SAT analogy:\n\nHigh NFLPA Player Grades are to Ross,\n\nwhat AFC Championships and Lombardis are to some owners.\n\n👆that’s my concern, different names=same net results\n\nEjplaya is concerned about the lack of talent on the roster and the lack of cap or a high enough draft pick to make an immediate difference.\n\nThe biggest concern is have with the staff is their lack of ammunition. They have very little talent on the roster, no cap space, and a first round draft pick outside the top 10. Tough to turn things around quickly without those things.\n\nMIAMI235 is concerned about the new regime having to learn as they go.\n\nConcern: Too much “ On The Job Learning “, as we have watched through the years.\n\nsdphinsfan wants to know whether they can walk the walk, not just talk the talk. Is also concerned that they will be able to compile the right level of talent.\n\nExecution. Haf and JES look and sound the part. Their background is just what you want. But you have to get the “right” players because for as much focus as we put on the FO and the coaching, it’s a players game and the players are what makes it happen. If you have the right players, its easier to go from 4 wins to 14 than it is to go from 7 to 11. When you’re stuck in the middle, it’s harder to make the changes you need to make because you think you are closer than you really are.\n\nUrthling has multiple concerns, inclusing the getting the culture right and the quarterback problem. Also, we are impatient. Damn right we are!\n\nWith an impatient fanbase and sometimes mercurial owner, will Haf and Sully get a fair shake to turn Miami around?\n\nWith the current QB, cap and roster situations it looks like it could take a few years.\n\nThere’s also the secondary concern of creating a “winning culture”, that might be difficult to accomplish if the next 1-2 seasons we pile up more losses than wins, unless the players feel that significant progress is being made.\n\nThat’s a laundry list, and every one of those concerns seems more than legit. Clearly, we are all concerned about the lack of a quality quarterback, a strong team culture of winning, and the overall lack of talent in the right positions on the roster. Let’s hope that they got it right this time, or it’s going to be another long, ugly ride for us in the fanbase. As always, thank you to each of you who come into our posts nearly every evening or the next morning and answer our question of the day.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United pulled off yet another Fergie time heist, this time away at West Ham United on Tuesday, as they came away from the London Stadium with a point.\n\nThe visitors were far from their fluent best and struggled to create anything of note, with the summer signings, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, unable to break down the Hammers’ low block.\n\nThe squad also appears ill-equipped to deal with the pressures of playing twice a week, and Michael Carrick’s blushes were only spared by a stoppage-time equaliser from Benjamin Sesko.\n\nThe Slovenian’s smart finish ensured United remained in fourth position in the Premier League table.\n\nTalking to TNT Sports after the match, the 22-year-old revealed that he was delighted with his goal but disappointed with the result.\n\nHe explained that the Red Devils lacked intensity, which was the main reason behind the disappointing performance.\n\n“I’m happy with my finish, but yeah, not so happy with the draw, because I know we deserve the win because we were fighting till the end.\n\n“Unfortunately, these days come when you’re a bit unlucky. Maybe the intensity was not exactly what it should be. But yeah, we were fighting. In the end, we got a draw, which is really important.”\n\nTo plenty of the away fans, it will almost feel like a win given the dramatic circumstances of the goal.\n\nThe former RB Leipzig striker also revealed that the camaraderie between the players and the desire to work as a unit have been helping the team over the line since Carrick came onboard.\n\n“We are working together no matter what is happening. If we are behind, if we are in front, it does not matter as we are always fighting. As I said again, today, was important to get this draw, because it was difficult game for us.\n\n“They were dangerous on the counter attacks when they took a ball. But yeah, we managed to finish with one. We feel amazing. We are doing everything together. When difficult moments are coming, we’re facing it together, which is really important and can lead to the results like right now.”\n\nThe Slovenian international further explained that a bit more energy and focus will be required for the team to return to winning ways once they return to action in two weeks.\n\n“I think we just have to keep on going like we were doing the last games. Just we have to keep in mind that we have to breathe for each other, and we have to we have to take care in every single situations, every every second of the game, to be focused, to be on point, and obviously when the chances are coming to finish them.”\n\nFeature image Justin Setterfield via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "A new commercial mobile spyware platform dubbed ZeroDayRAT is being advertised to cybercriminals on Telegram as a tool that provides full remote control over compromised Android and iOS devices.\n\nThe malware provides buyers with a full-featured panel for managing infected devices, reportedly supporting Android 5 through 16 and iOS up to version 26 latest.\n\nResearchers at mobile threat hunting company iVerify say that ZeroDayRAT not just steals data but also enables real-time surveillance and financial theft.\n\nThe dashboard shows compromised devices and information about the model, operating system version, battery status, SIM details, country, and lock state.\n\nThe malware can log app usage, activity timelines, SMS message exchanges, and provides an overview to the operator.\n\nOther tracking tabs on the dashboard display all received notifications, and also registered accounts on the infected device, showing email/user ID, potentially enabling brute-forcing and credential stuffing.\n\nIf GPS access is secured, the malware can also track the victim in real time and draw their current position on a Google Maps view, with full location history.\n\nApart from passive data logging, ZeroDayRAT also supports active hands-on operations, such as activating the device’s cameras (front and rear) and microphone to gain access to a live media feed, or recording the victim’s screen to expose other secrets.\n\nMoreover, if the SMS access permission is secured, the malware can capture incoming one-time passwords (OTPs), enabling 2FA bypass, and also send SMS from the victim’s device.\n\nThe malware developer also included a keylogging module that can capture user input, like passwords, gestures, or screen unlock patterns.\n\nFurther financial theft is enabled through a cryptocurrency stealer module. The researchers found that the component activates a wallet app scanner looking for MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Binance, and Coinbase, logs wallet IDs and balances, and attempts clipboard address injection, replacing copied wallet addresses with attacker-controlled ones.\n\nThe bank stealer targets online banking apps, UPI platforms like Google Pay and PhonePe, and payment services such as Apple Pay and PayPal. Credential theft occurs by overlaying fake screens.\n\niVerify does not detail how the malware is delivered but say that ZeroDayRAT \"is a complete mobile compromise toolkit.\" The researchers warn that a compromised employee device could lead to enterprise breaches.\n\nFor an individual, a ZeroDayRAT compromise could expose their privacy and lead to financial losses.\n\nUsers are recommended to only trust the official app stores, Google Play on Android and Apple Store on iOS, and install apps from reputable publishers. High-risk users should consider enabling Lockdown Mode on iOS and Advanced Protection on Android.\n\nModern IT infrastructure moves faster than manual workflows can handle.\n\nIn this new Tines guide, learn how your team can reduce hidden manual delays, improve reliability through automated response, and build and scale intelligent workflows on top of tools you already use.",

    "fullText": "Rules of mysterious ancient Roman board game decoded by AI\n\nA Roman stone board game has been unplayable since its discovery more than a century ago, but AI might have just worked out the rules\n\nJoin Our Community of Science Lovers!\n\nIt was the summer of 2020, and researcher Walter Crist was wandering around the exhibits inside a Dutch museum dedicated to the presence of the ancient Roman empire in the Netherlands. As a scientist who studies ancient board games, one exhibit stuck out to Crist: a stone game board dating to the late Roman Empire. It was about eight inches across and etched with angular lines that roughly formed the shape of an oblong octagon inside a rectangle.\n\n“I thought to myself, ‘Well, that’s very interesting,’ because the pattern on it—it’s not something I had ever seen in the literature before,” Crist says.\n\nWhat the game was called and how it was played were a mystery, too.\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nCrist contacted the museum curators to get a closer look. And now he and his colleagues believe they’ve decoded the game in a first-of-its-kind study using a combination of more traditional archaeological methods and artificial intelligence. According to the analysis, the object appears to be a sort of “blocking game.” In these types of games, one player tries to block another from moving; one example is tic-tac-toe.\n\nThe research was published on Monday in the journal Antiquity.\n\nCrist, now a guest lecturer at Leiden University in the Netherlands, recalls that when he and his team started investigating the board game, they didn’t have a ton of details to work with. They knew that the game board had been found around the late 1800s or early 1900s in the southeastern Netherlands’ city of Heerlen—which would have been the city of Coriovallum in Roman times. The board was made out limestone that was imported from France. And the game was likely played casually and may not have been particularly notable, in part because there is no known documentation of it in written texts from the time.\n\nTo decipher the rules, Crist’s team programmed two AI agents to play the game over and over again using more than 100 different sets of rules taken from other known European games, both ancient and modern. As the AI agents played—1,000 games per set of rules—the researchers tracked how the pieces moved. Then they compared the moves with the levels of wear on areas of the board, tracing which gameplay seemed to replicate grooves on the stone.\n\nThe team found nine rule sets that appeared “consistent” with the wear on the board. “And they were all variations of this same kind of blocking game,” Crist says.\n\nThis type of game was played in the 19th and 20th centuries in Scandinavia, and researchers thought it dated to early medieval times. But the Roman game is the earliest example of such a game in Europe, Crist says. He and his team called the game Ludus Coriovalli, Latin for “the game from Coriovallum.” (You can play it online here.)\n\nCrist hopes the study will help researchers solve other ancient board games. Such games offer a way to connect the ancient past to our own lives, he says. Indeed, they haven’t changed much over the centuries. The ancient Egyptian board game Senet, for example, might not have been all that different from Sorry! Chess, meanwhile, is thought to have originated in ancient India, and nobody really knows when or where backgammon originated.\n\nUnderstanding how ancient games might’ve been played, Crist says, “can lead us to new insights on how people in the past enjoyed their lives.”\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, I’d like to ask for your support.

    "title": "Scientists reimagine a forgotten battery design from Thomas Edison",
    "description": "International team creates quick-charging, long-lasting prototype with potential for renewable energy storage",
    "fullText": "A little-known fact: In the year 1900, electric cars outnumbered gas-powered ones on the American road.\n\nThe lead-acid auto battery of the time, courtesy of Thomas Edison, was expensive and had a range of only about 30 miles. Seeking to improve on this, Edison believed the nickel-iron battery was the future, with the promise of a 100-mile range, a long life and a recharge time of seven hours, fast for that era.\n\nAlas, that promise never reached fruition. Early electric car batteries still suffered from serious limitations, and advances in the internal combustion engine won the day.\n\nNow, an international research collaboration co-led by UCLA has taken a page from Edison’s book, developing nickel-iron battery technology that may be well-suited for storing energy generated at solar farms. The prototype was able to recharge in only seconds, instead of hours, and achieved over 12,000 cycles of draining and recharging — the equivalent of more than 30 years of daily recharges.\n\nThe technology was built from tiny clusters of metal patterned using proteins that were then bonded to a two-dimensional material, made of sheets only one atom thick. Despite the innovative ingredients, the techniques are deceptively straightforward and inexpensive.\n\n“People often think of modern nanotechnology tools as complicated and high-tech, but our approach is surprisingly simple and straightforward,” said study co-author Maher El-Kady, an assistant researcher in the UCLA College’s chemistry and biochemistry department. “We are just mixing common ingredients, applying gentle heating steps and using raw materials that are widely available.”\n\nThe study was published in the journal Small and is featured on the back cover.\n\nThe natural world provided some cues for the researchers. Of particular interest was the process by which animals form bones and shellfish form their hard outer casings. Whether skeletons are inside or outside, they’re made by proteins that act as scaffolds for collecting calcium-based compounds.\n\nThe researchers sought to mimic this mechanism to generate their tiny clusters of nickel or iron, according to co-corresponding author Ric Kaner, a distinguished professor of chemistry and biochemistry in the UCLA College and of materials science and engineering in the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering.\n\n“We were inspired by the way nature deposits these types of materials,” said Kaner, who is also the holder of the Dr. Myung Ki Hong Endowed Chair in Materials Innovation and a member of the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA. “Laying down minerals in the correct fashion builds bones that are strong, yet flexible enough to not be brittle. How it’s done is almost as important as the material used, and proteins guide how they are placed.”\n\nIn the study, the team used proteins that are byproducts of beef production. The molecules served as templates for growing clusters of nickel for positive electrodes and iron for negative electrodes. The nooks and crannies in the folded protein structure limited the size of the metal clusters to fewer than 5 nanometers. That’s so small that it would take about 10,000 to 20,000 clusters to match the width of a human hair. The researchers even detected single atoms of iron and nickel in their electrodes.\n\nThe proteins were combined with graphene oxide, an ultrathin 2D material that comes in sheets a single atom thick comprising carbon decorated with oxygen atoms. While the oxygen can create clogs that make the material act more like an insulator, the process that followed changed everything.\n\nThe ingredients were superheated in water then baked at high-temperature, causing the proteins to char into carbon, stripping away the oxygen in the 2D material and embedding the tiny metal clusters guided by the proteins. The resulting structure was an aerogel, made of almost 99% air by volume.\n\nPart of the technology’s secret sauce is surface area — the more exposed, the more space for the reactions behind battery chemistry to take place.\n\nThere was plenty of such room provided by the graphene aerogel’s thinness and surplus of empty space. And the tininess of the metal nanoclusters takes advantage of a fundamental mathematical principle: as objects get smaller, the size of the exposed outer surface increases far more than volume does.\n\n“As we go from larger particles down to these extremely tiny nanoclusters, the surface area gets dramatically higher,” El-Kady said. “That’s a huge advantage for batteries. When the particles are that tiny, almost every single atom can participate in the reaction. So, charging and discharging happen way faster, you can store more charge, and the whole battery just works more efficiently.”\n\nDespite its advantages in charging speed and durability, this iteration of the technology does not match the storage capabilities of today’s lithium-ion batteries. With range at a premium in the electric car market, the researchers think that this Edison-inspired battery of the future may one day find application in other areas.\n\nFor instance, the technology’s fast charging, high output and robust endurance suggest a good fit for storing excess electricity generated at solar farms during the daytime, to power the grid at night. It may also be useful for backup power at data centers.\n\n“Because this technology could extend the lifetime of batteries to decades upon decades, it might be ideal for storing renewable energy or quickly taking over when power is lost,” El-Kady said. “This would remove worries about the changing cost of infrastructure.”\n\nThe researchers are exploring the use of their nanocluster fabrication technique with other metals. They’re also looking at possible replacements for bovine proteins, such as natural polymers that are more abundant, and thus less expensive and easier to scale up for future manufacturing.\n\nThe study’s first author is Habibeh Bishkul of Tarbiat Modares University in Tehran, Iran.

    "description": "Jimmy Ba left the company one day after the departure of Tony Wu, another cofounder at Elon Musk's AI company.",
    "fullText": "XAI cofounder Jimmy Ba said he left Elon Musk's startup on Tuesday.\n\n\"It's time to recalibrate my gradient on the big picture. 2026 is gonna be insane and likely the busiest (and most consequential) year for the future of our species,\" Ba wrote on X.\n\nBa reported directly to Musk. He ran a large portion of the company until late last year, when several of his responsibilities were split between two other cofounders, Tony Wu and Guodong Zhang, people with knowledge of the move told Business Insider.\n\nBa also previously ran the team that oversaw more than a thousand AI tutors, according to an org chart from earlier last year. That role was given to Diego Pasini in September, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nBa is the second cofounder to depart the company in less than 48 hours. Wu announced he'd resigned from the AI startup on Monday night. Wu's Slack account was deactivated shortly before the announcement, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nAhead of Wu's departure, xAI underwent another restructuring, and several of his responsibilities were shifted under Zhang.\n\nMusk launched the AI company in 2023 with 11 other founders. Six have now left the company — five of them within the last year.\n\nIn addition to his work at xAI, Ba is an assistant professor at the University of Toronto in the computer science department. He received his Ph.D. from the school while studying under Nobel Prize winner Geoffrey Hinton, often referred to as the \"godfather of AI.\"\n\nMusk has said he built xAI as an alternative to what he's called \"woke\" chatbots, like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Over the past year, the company has become known for pushing the envelope. Last July, xAI launched a sexy digital avatar called \"Ani,\" and its Grok chatbot went on an antisemitic rant.\n\nMost recently, xAI has come under fire after Grok began generating nonconsensual sexual images of real people in response to X user prompts. The backlash eventually prompted the company to restrict Grok's image-generation features on X.\n\nLast week, Musk announced that xAI would merge with his rocket company, SpaceX. The company is reportedly gearing up for an initial public offering this year that could value SpaceX at $1.5 trillion.\n\nBa and xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDo you work for xAI or have a tip?

    "description": "A look at the limitations of generic agents and MCPs, through the lens of building Tidewave, and what this means for the future of coding agents",
    "fullText": "The first appearances of coding agents were within our editors, as a natural progression from tab autocompletion. When Claude Code was released, almost a year ago, it innovated in many ways, particularly by demonstrating that although we write almost all of our code in editors, the agents themselves don’t have to be constrained to IDEs. As a result, most of our agentic development moved to the terminal.\n\nWith the release of the Codex App, we will start to see a push towards richer interfaces. However, this raises the question: if we can run coding agents anywhere, where is the best place to run them?\n\nIn this section, I will talk about Tidewave, the coding agent we built for full-stack web development. It is a sales pitch but I hope it is a good example of what we can gain by building vertical coding agents.\n\nTidewave was born out of frustration when using coding agents to build web applications. I frequently stumbled upon scenarios such as:\n\nThe agent would tell me a feature was complete, but when I tried it in the browser, form submission would not complete\n\nWhenever I encountered an exception page during development, I had to copy and paste stacktraces from the browser to the agent\n\nI had to constantly translate what was on the page to source code. If I wanted to “Add an Export to CSV button to a dropdown button”, the first step was typically to find where the template or component the dropdown was defined in\n\nUltimately, because the coding agent was unable to interact with or see what it produced, I had to act as the middleman:\n\nAnd while things have improved within the last year, most of the tooling out there does not fully close this gap. For example, while coding agents can read logs and editors like Cursor do include a browser, they do not correlate the browser actions with the logs, leaving space for guess work and context bloat. Or when the browser renders a page, it doesn’t know which controller or template it came from.\n\nWe solved this problem by moving the coding agent to the browser and making it aware of your web app:\n\nYou open up Tidewave in your favorite browser and its agent can now interact with the page you are looking at, validating the application works as desired by accessing the DOM, loading pages, filling forms, etc\n\nWhen something goes wrong, we parse and feed the exact information from the rendered error page. We also include any console.log and server logs related to the particular agent action (instead of the whole history)\n\nWhen you inspect an element in Tidewave, we automatically map DOM elements to source files. If you inspect a dropdown, we tell the agent its location on the page as well as the template/component it came from in the source code\n\nThe coding agent has access to your backend too, so it can read documentation, execute SQL queries, and even gets a REPL-like environment. So when the agent gets stuck, it can navigate the data, run code, and explore APIs, like any developer would\n\nMore importantly, this is all implemented by connecting the agent to your running application. You can ask your agent to analyze cache usage in your Rails application or to debug a LiveView in Phoenix, and it can do so because they talk to each other directly. Your agent is no longer limited to a series of bash commands.\n\nOverall, the agent becomes more capable, and we no longer need to act as the middleman:\n\nFor all of the above to work, instead of building a generic agent that works with every tool, Tidewave directly integrates with each web framework we support (Django, FastAPI, Flask, Next.js, Phoenix, Rails, and TanStack Start), mapping all layers to the agent, from the database to UI.\n\nAnd that’s what I mean by vertical integration: coding agents become integrated into the specific platform or runtime they’re building for. They understand the relationship between code and its live behavior, and can debug both.\n\nWe can easily draw parallels between the above and other domains. Agents for mobile development must have full access to a simulator to interact with the app UI, translate view hierarchies to source code, and monitor network requests. Similar patterns could apply to IoT devices, game development, etc.\n\nAs a matter of fact, this isn’t even a new idea. Data scientists were the first to embed agents directly into their notebooks, where they can execute code, visualize results, inspect dataframes, etc. They were the first to realize the benefit of vertically integrating agents and everyone else is just late to the party.\n\nBut how can we make these vertical integrations possible? If we want agents to access our runtimes and environments, could MCPs be the tool to make this a reality? That’s what we originally thought…\n\nTidewave was first prototyped as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and it quickly became obvious it wasn’t enough. In this section, I’ll focus on how MCPs can be detrimental to user experience. In particular, we’ll look at its limitations as a pull-only interface and its text-based constraints.\n\nAs an example, let’s look at Figma’s MCP. It allows developers to select an element in Figma’s desktop app and ask the agent to implement the design. Here’s a screenshot from their announcement:\n\nAs you can see, you’re required to make a selection in Figma, then explicitly ask the agent to query your selection. The agent then proceeds to talk to Figma and get the relevant data. That’s a lot of unecessary back and forth! If I already selected an element on Figma, it should take a single click to embed that information into my prompt.\n\nNow imagine if, every time I inspected an element in the browser, we had to tell the agent to ask the browser about the selection. We refused to implement that. Instead, we made it just work:\n\nFurthermore, by making the inspected elements part of our prompt, you can select multiple elements and dictate how they all need to change at once. You can reorder, swap, and coordinate multiple changes easily.\n\nSimilarly, when you see an error page in the browser, you should only need to click a button to fix it - not copy and paste stacktraces or ask the agent to read logs.\n\nNone of this could be built with MCPs because they are pull-based. The agent decides when to invoke the MCP and you are forced to ask the agents to perform actions on your behalf. MCPs do not allow us to attach rich metadata to prompts either.\n\nImagine you need help addressing comments in a pull request. You can tell the agent to use GitHub’s MCP or even use a custom skill that uses GitHub’s CLI to fetch all current comments. But once the agent does its initial assessment, all further exchanges happens through text: “ignore this comment”, “no, not this comment, the one above it”.\n\nNow compare that to using any graphical (or even a terminal) interface: we can reply in thread, comment on specific lines, or click a button to dismiss invalid feedback altogether. In other words, when we put our integrations behind MCPs, all exchange happens on text, and we often end-up with worse user experiences.\n\nInstead, our goal is to build agentic tools and user experiences side-by-side. For example, when we added Web Accessibility diagnostics to Tidewave, we exposed additional tools to the agent, but we also provided a polished experience for when developers want to remain in the loop:\n\nOur recently announced Supabase integration works the same: it runs performance and security advisors on your database and present them to you. If you want to dig deeper, you can do it all through a rich interface. And if you don’t care about any of that, you can either click the “Fix all” button or ask your agent to do it for you.\n\nTo build these experiences, we had to invert the control. We don’t want the agent to call us, we want our tools to call the agent.\n\nSay you want to build your own agentic loop, up until recently, doing so meant to:\n\nWhile the above is already a lot of work, you must remember that prompt engineering, tool calls, etc. must be fine-tuned per model. For example, when OpenAI announced GPT-5-Codex, integrators had to write new prompts and new tools, even if they already supported GPT-5.\n\nAnd the above covers only the basic loop! What about AGENTS.md, MCPs, or skills? And you haven’t even started working on what makes your coding agent unique.\n\nLuckily for us, many of the leading AI companies have built their own coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI) tailored to their models, and many have exposed those agents through SDKs. We also have fantastic open source alternatives. This means you can cut out much of the work above, but, if you want to support multiple providers, you’re still on the hook for integrating them one by one.\n\nThat’s exactly where the Agent Client Protocol from the Zed team comes in. It standardizes communication with coding agents, so you implement one protocol and support multiple agents at once. This ultimately allows you to focus on the runtime integrations and user experiences that make your coding agent unique.\n\nFurthermore, even if you’re not implementing your own agent, ACP should matter to you because it brings portability to developers. You can use a single coding agent across the terminal, your editor, and Tidewave, reusing the same settings for hooks, skills, and subagents. And perhaps more importantly, the same subscription.\n\nWe are big fans of the Agent Client Protocol and we are excited to build on top of it alongside companies like Zed and JetBrains.\n\nGeneric agents that work everywhere force awkward workflows where we constantly act as a middleman. Instead, we want to embed agents into the platforms we are building on, so they can see the relationship between code and behavior, interact with live apps, and debug in real-time.\n\nHowever, to build these rich experiences, we need to invert the control and own the agentic loop. The Agent Client Protocol (ACP) allows us to do so by standardizing communication across providers, so we can focus on the user experiences and integrations that make our coding agents unique, instead of wrestling with multiple SDKs.\n\nI hope this article inspires you to fine-tune your own coding agents and, if you are looking for a coding agent tailored to full-stack web development, give Tidewave a try!",

    "fullText": "Through carbon dating, researchers have ruled that the artifacts are between approximately 11,700 and 12,900 years old, a time when Ice Age temperatures had returned after a brief warm period.\n\nResearchers have identified what is believed to be the world's oldest sewn animal hide, along with Ice Age eyed bone needles, discovered in Oregon, according to researchers from a consortium of North American universities.\n\nThe study, published in Science Advances, analyzed 55 artifacts discovered in the Cougar Mountain Cave (CMC) and Paisley Caves in central Oregon, and Smith Creek Cave and Bonneville Estates Rockshelter in Nevada, though the significant findings were discovered in the former two.\n\nThrough carbon dating, researchers have ruled that the artifacts are between approximately 11,700 and 12,900 years old, a time when Ice Age temperatures had returned after a brief warm period.\n\nCMC was originally dug up in 1958 by an amateur archaeologist named John Cowles. The artifacts analyzed in the study are part of Cowles’ original collection of excavated findings, now housed at the Favell Museum in Klamath Falls, Oregon.\n\nPaisley Caves, or Paisley Five Mile Point Caves, were first studied by archaeologist Luther Cressman in the 1930s, and were added to the US National Register of Historic Places in 2014.\n\nAccording to researchers, the most remarkable find was a piece of elk hide with thread sewn through its edge. The thread, which researchers determined was made from plant fiber and animal hair twisted together, connected the main hide piece to a smaller fragment, which is tied in a knot.\n\nThe hide was dated three times to confirm an age of roughly 12,000 years, according to the study, and chemical analysis confirmed it came from a North American elk.\n\nResearchers also studied 14 bone needles from four different sites and determined that they had been carved from the bones of both bison and mountain sheep.\n\n“In all of North America, there are only 17 sites with bone needles in Pleistocene-aged [Ice Age] contexts, while in South America, there are none,” according to the study.\n\nThe two caves contain 80% of all the dated plant and animal materials from the Ice Age period found anywhere in North or South America, the study explained, noting that 23 fiber artifacts, 12 wooden tools, and three pieces of hide had been found in CMC alone.\n\nThe fiber artifacts are mostly three-strand braided rope made from sagebrush bark, and fragments of tightly woven basketry were also found, marking the oldest evidence of baskets in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe caves also contained 79 stone spear points, many resharpened multiple times, alongside bison, elk, and rabbit bones.\n\n“The abundance of bone needles and the presence ofadornment items and very fine eyed needles suggest that clothingwas more than a utilitarian survival strategy but also an avenue of expression and identity,” the study concluded.\n\n“This evidence pushes beyond conventional assumptions to confirm that Pleistocene peoples in the Americas used clothing as both survival technology andsocial practice.”",

    "description": "The White House says President Donald Trump has the right to amend a permit for a new bridge between Canada and Michigan, prolonging the latest dispute between the U.S. and its northern neighbor hours...",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House says President Donald Trump has the right to amend a permit for a new bridge between Canada and Michigan, prolonging the latest dispute between the U.S. and its northern neighbor hours after its prime minister signaled there could be a detente.\n\nThe Gordie Howe International Bridge, which would connect Ontario and Michigan and would be a vital economic artery between the two countries, is scheduled to open in early 2026. But Trump has now threatened to block the bridge from being opened, calling for Canada to agree to a litany of unspecified demands as the two nations prepare to renegotiate a sprawling trade pact later this year.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said earlier Tuesday that he spoke with Trump and expressed confidence that the spat would be resolved. But a White House official later Tuesday said the ownership structure of the bridge remains unacceptable for the U.S. president.\n\nCanada paid for the bridge, named after a Canadian-born Detroit Red Wings hockey star. Construction has been underway since 2018.\n\nThe official said that all international infrastructure projects require a presidential permit, and that Trump would be within his right to amend that permit. The person was granted anonymity because they did not have permission to speak publicly.\n\n“The fact that Canada will control what crosses the Gordie Howe Bridge and owns the land on both sides is unacceptable to the president,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday. “It’s also unacceptable that more of this bridge isn’t being built with more American-made materials.”\n\nThe new fight over the bridge is the latest volley in an increasingly sour relationship between the United States and Canada, particularly over trade policy. Trump has also mused publicly about acquiring Canada as the 51st U.S. state, much to the dismay of Canadians.\n\nFollowing his conversation with Trump, Carney said “this is going to be resolved” and noted that he told the U.S. president that the Canadian and Michigan governments shared ownership of the bridge. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office has also emphasized that the bridge will be operated under a joint ownership agreement between the state and Canada, even though the Canadian government paid for it.\n\nCarney also added that U.S. steel was used in the project, which also employed U.S. workers. According to Carney, Trump told him he’ll ask the U.S. ambassador to Canada, former Michigan Rep. Pete Hoekstra, to “play a role in smoothing the conversation in and around the bridge.”\n\nHoekstra did not return an immediate request for comment.\n\n“I look forward to it opening and what is particularly important is the commerce and the tourism of Canadians and Americans that go across that bridge,” Carney said.\n\nThe project was negotiated by former Michigan Republican Gov. Rick Snyder and paid for by the Canadian government to help ease congestion over the existing Ambassador Bridge and Detroit-Windsor tunnel.\n\nSnyder wrote in an op-ed in The Detroit News on Tuesday that Trump was wrong in asserting that Canada owns both the U.S.- and Canadian sides of the Gordie Howe bridge.\n\n“Canada and the state of Michigan are 50/50 owners of the new bridge,\" Snyder wrote. “Canada was wonderful and financed the entire bridge. They will get repaid with interest from the tolls. Michigan and the United States got their half-ownership with no investment.”\n\nThe former governor also emphasized that parts of the bridge construction were exempt from “Buy America” requirements for its steel because half of the project was outside the U.S. and subsequently, U.S. law should not apply to them.\n\n“President Trump, I would encourage you to challenge your advisers and the sources for your post to correct the information they have provided,” Snyder wrote in the op-ed. He acknowledged some trade issues with Canada, but “picking this bridge as the leverage point doesn’t seem to make the most sense given your other tools.\"",

    "fullText": "Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) said “there aren’t anywhere close to the votes” needed to change the Senate’s filibuster rule to allow Republican-sponsored legislation to reform voter registration requirements to pass the upper chamber with fewer than 60 votes.\n\nThune on Tuesday dismissed the idea that Republicans might lower the procedural threshold for advancing the House-passed SAVE Act, which would require people to show passports or birth certificates as proof of citizenship when registering to vote.\n\nThune said he supports passing federal law to require documented proof of citizenship when registering to vote, but he dismissed talk of changing the Senate rules to create a pathway to passing the legislation, which Democrats strongly oppose.\n\nThune pledged to protect the Senate’s filibuster rule, which requires 60 votes to advance legislation, when he ran for Senate majority leader in 2024.\n\nHe said his position is broadly supported within the Senate Republican Conference.\n\n“It’s not just me not being willing to do it. There aren’t anywhere close to the votes, not even close, to nuking the filibuster,” he said of a proposal to lower the threshold for advancing legislation to a simple majority by voting along partisan lines to establish new precedent.\n\nEffectively changing the Senate’s rules with a party-line vote overruling the presiding chair or Senate parliamentarian is viewed as so extreme that it’s nicknamed “the nuclear option.”\n\nThune said the proposal “doesn’t have a future. Is there another way of getting there? We’ll see,” he said.\n\nThune made his comments after Senate Steering Committee Chair Mike Lee (R-Utah) made a pitch to the Senate GOP conference Tuesday to interpret the current Senate rules to require Democrats to continuously hold the floor with active debate to block the SAVE Act or other items on President Trump’s agenda.\n\n“We’re having a very robust conversation among our Senate Republican colleagues about the path forward. I think most are supporters … I certainly am — of the SAVE Act and what it attempts to accomplish,” Thune told reporters after the meeting.\n\n“You ought to be able to prove that you’re a citizen of this country in order to be able to vote. How we get to that vote remains to be seen,” he said.\n\nThune last week signaled his reluctance to require Democrats to stand at their desks on the Senate floor for hours on end in order to make it more arduous for them to block the SAVE Act.\n\nThe GOP leader warned that reinterpreting how the Senate’s filibuster rule is deployed could tie up the floor for weeks.\n\n“There are a lot of implications and ramifications to that, that I think our conference would need to have a conversation about. Obviously, it ties up the floor indefinitely, so it means you’re not doing other things. There’s always an opportunity cost,” Thune said, referring to the so-called standing filibuster\n\nHe warned that requiring Democrats to actively hold the floor is an “exercise that would go on for an indefinite period of time.”\n\nOther GOP senators have poured cold water on the idea of requiring a standing or talking filibuster.\n\nSenate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) cautioned that reinterpreting the filibuster rule would “change the Senate” and likely lead to the abolition of the minority party’s ability to hold up legislation.\n\n“Filibuster changes, I think, change the Senate. It may happen one day, but I don’t think it’s a good idea,” he said.\n\n“Because the Senate becomes the House,” he added, referring to the strict majoritarian rule in the lower chamber.",

    "description": "Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said total spending is up across US consumers, but some are doubling down on value.",
    "fullText": "Coca-Cola (KO) stock fell as much as 4% early Tuesday after the company offered what CEO James Quincey called a \"prudent\" outlook for 2026 as it aims to reverse pressure on international sales.\n\n\"We've taken what we think is a realistic, but prudent, approach relative to a number of international markets [where] we need to see improve through the course of 2026,\" Quincey told Yahoo Finance.\n\nWhich international markets are pressuring Coca-Cola's growth?\n\nWhy did Coca-Cola stock fall after earnings?\n\nHow are zero-sugar products performing for Coca-Cola?\n\nWhat leadership changes are happening at Coca-Cola?\n\nIn the fourth quarter, organic revenue grew 5% across the company's geographies, outpacing the 4.8% growth expected by Wall Street. For 2026, the company expects organic sales to grow 4%-5%, below the 5% growth expected by analysts, according to Bloomberg data. Coca-Cola's adjusted earnings are expected to grow in a range of 7%-8% this year after growing 9% in 2025.\n\nSome regions where the company is experiencing pressure include China, India, and Mexico, where a soft drink tax was recently implemented. Sales in its Asia Pacific region were flat in the fourth quarter.\n\nRead more about Coca-Cola's stock moves and today's market action.\n\nIn North America, the company said volumes grew 1% while prices were up 4% in the fourth quarter as consumers continued to turn to less-sugary options.\n\n\"You see strength [in] Coke Zero, even Diet Coke is growing,\" Quincey said. Across all geographies, volumes for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar were up 13% in the fourth quarter and 14% for the full year. Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Light volume was up 2% for the quarter and flat for the year.\n\n\"The protein — Fairlife, Core Power — is growing,\" Quincey said. \"The hydration ... BodyArmor is growing volume and gaining share. Similarly with some of the water,\" he added, regarding the US market.\n\nAs zero or low-sugar sodas continue to gain share, the company tested a Simply Pop prebiotic soda to compete with PepsiCo's $2 billion Poppi acquisition, but it's slow going, Quincey said.\n\n\"It's still very early days ... We leveraged some of our learnings from Coca-Cola Plus from Japan ... we're still trying to learn what really makes that subcategory tick,\" he said.\n\nAs for how bifurcated consumer habits in the US are impacting the business, Quincey said \"total spending is holding up,\" but consumers are picking and choosing how many and where they're buying.\"\n\n\"Lower-income consumers are doing value-based shopping,\" Quincey said. \"Whether that's the dollar channel or any other channel, and so we've had a clear affordability strategy over the last few years, and we think that's working for us.\"",

    "fullText": "Google's business unit is offering voluntary exit packages to some employees.\n\nIn an email sent to staff on Tuesday, Google's chief business officer, Philipp Schindler, said employees on certain teams within the global business organization (GBO) could voluntarily leave the company with a severance package. \n\n\"We're starting the year in a strong position thanks to everything you accomplished in 2025,\" Schindler wrote in the memo, which Business Insider viewed. \"But the game is dynamic, the pace is electric, and the stakes are high.\"\n\nSchindler told employees in the memo that everyone in GBO needs to be \"all in\" on the mission and \"embracing AI to have even greater impact\".\n\nFor employees who weren't \"enjoying the pace we need to operate in\" or who are \"ready to move on from Google,\" Schindler said the company would offer a voluntary exit program for certain roles within GBO in the US. This includes employees working on solutions teams, sales, corporate development, and others. \n\nSchindler said America's large customer sales teams and other customer-facing roles would not be eligible for the programs.\n\n\"While all GBO functions are essential to our long-term strategy, we've decided not to offer VEP for these particular roles to limit as much disruption to our customers as possible,\" he wrote.\n\nGoogle has made similar offers to employees in other orgs over the past year. Last June, Google offered buyouts to some US-based employees as it cracked down on its return-to-office mandate. In October, it offered buyouts to YouTube employees as part of a reorganization.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nHave something to share?

Videos show the person appearing to use plants to block the front porch doorbell camera.\n\n\"Law enforcement has uncovered these previously inaccessible new images showing an armed individual appearing to have tampered with the camera at Nancy Guthrie's front door the morning of her disappearance,\" a statement posted on FBI director Kash Patel's X account Tuesday read.\n\nAuthorities believe Nancy Guthrie was taken from her home, just outside Tucson, in the Catalina Foothills, against her will, 10 days ago. The Pima County Sheriff's Department has said that blood discovered on the porch matched to her.\n\nThe 84-year-old woman, who has limited mobility, a pacemaker, and depends on daily medication for a heart condition, was reported missing by her family on February 1 after she was last seen the night before when they dropped her off at home following a dinner.\n\nNew images in the search for Nancy Guthrie:\n\nOver the last eight days, the FBI and Pima County Sheriff’s Department have been working closely with our private sector partners to continue to recover any images or video footage from Nancy Guthrie’s home that may have been lost,… pic.twitter.com/z5WLgPtZpT\n\nFor days, authorities were unable to access the footage from Nancy Guthrie's doorbell camera, which they said suddenly disconnected at 1:47 a.m. MST on February 1. The doorbell camera had also been removed, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos has previously said.\n\nOn Tuesday, the authorities said they have been working closely with private sector partners \"to recover any images or video footage from Nancy Guthrie's home that may have been lost, corrupted, or inaccessible due to a variety of factors - including the removal of recording devices.\"\n\n\"The video was recovered from residual data located in backend systems,\" said the Tuesday statement from authorities, which was shared by Patel and the Pima County Sheriff's Department.\n\nVideos recovered from the doorbell camera were released by Patel in separate X posts.\n\nLaw enforcement officials have not identified any persons of interest or suspects in the case, which has captured national attention amid reports of purported ransom notes and emotional video pleas by Savannah Guthrie and her siblings.\n\nOn Monday, the famed NBC anchor posted an Instagram video, telling her nearly two million followers: \"We are at an hour of desperation, and we need your help.\"\n\n\"Law enforcement is working tirelessly around the clock trying to bring her home, trying to find her. She was taken, and we don't know where,\" Savannath Guthrie said as she called the situation a \"nightmare.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Savannah Guthrie also shared the doorbell images on her Instagram account in a post that said: \"We believe she is still alive.

    "description": "Matt Dolitsky’s video of the 110-foot vessel drew hundreds of thousands of views — and later, a court summons.",
    "fullText": "On a quiet bend of the South River, where feathery reeds crowd the shoreline and the mud smells faintly sour when the tide slips out, a 110-foot yacht sits wedged in a narrow creek.\n\nIts hull is rusted through in places. The deck sags. Graffiti and vines climb its bulwarks. Small trees have begun to grow in what were once staterooms.\n\nFor years, the vessel was mostly a curiosity, spotted from above by drone or on Google Maps and whispered about in Sayreville bars and online forums.\n\nThen, last fall, it became a courtroom problem.\n\nMatt Dolitsky, a YouTuber who explores abandoned places in New Jersey and New York for his channel Two Feet Outdoors, is scheduled to go on trial Feb. 26 in Sayreville Municipal Court.\n\nThe 55-year-old’s alleged crime? Trespassing, when he decided to paddle out and explore the wrecked yacht.\n\nHis November 2024 video documenting the trip has drawn more than 337,000 views — and, months later, a summons accusing him of unlawfully entering private property.\n\n“My focus was on the boat,” Dolitsky said in an interview with NJ.com. “You see this massive boat in this tiny little creek and wonder how it got there.”\n\nDolitsky’s videos are typically quiet, almost meditative. He glides through waterways and climbs into decaying structures, narrating what he sees. His fans describe them as calming, the type of vlogs you can watch while getting ready for bed.\n\nIn the yacht video, he kayaks up to the vessel during low tide. He climbs onto its weathered dock, crawls through brush and shimmies onto the deck, marveling at its scale and condition.\n\n“Nobody has a clue that I’m over here,” Dolitsky says at one point, his shadow cast against a smokestack as a truck beeps somewhere in the distance.\n\nWhat he did not expect was the notice that appeared in his mailbox six months later, warning that someone had filed a trespassing complaint against him in municipal court.\n\n“I was kind of shocked,” Dolitsky said. “I was thinking, ‘How is that even possible?’”\n\nThe complaint, filed last June, alleges that on Nov. 1, 2024, Dolitsky kayaked to the property, crossed onto private land and boarded the yacht.\n\nTrespassing is a petty disorderly persons offense in Sayreville, punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a fine of up to $500.\n\nWatch \"Urban Kayaking Adventure | Exploring an Abandoned 110 ft. Yacht Stuck in a Creek\" on YouTubeWatch\n\nThe charge was filed by Kersten Kortbawi, who owns the property the yacht sits on and the surrounding area. Much of the space is taken up by Viking Terminal, an industrial park that rents to commercial businesses.\n\nKortbawi did not respond to a request for comment from NJ.com.\n\nIn a prior statement to the Home News Tribune, she said “No Trespassing” signs have been posted around the property for decades and that Dolitsky’s own video shows one as he approached the dock from the river.\n\n“Importantly, the yellow-and-black ‘No Trespassing’ sign is shown in his YouTube video as he approached the dock on his kayak,” Kortbawi said.\n\nDolitsky disputes that account, saying he saw no such signage at the time and believes additional signs were installed afterward.\n\n“I didn’t see any ‘No Trespassing’ signs or anything saying, ‘Private Property,’” he said. “I guarantee after the fact they put up signs.”\n\nIn a video he posted in August updating his viewers on the case, he kayaks back to the dock, where a ‘No Trespassing’ sign can indeed be seen affixed to a post.\n\nThat same post is bare in his original November 2024 video.\n\nThe yacht has a longer, more mysterious history than the case surrounding it.\n\nThe vessel is listed on Google Maps as the Blue Jacket, a luxury motor vessel built in the Netherlands in the 1950s.\n\nIt’s not clear exactly when it fell into disrepair or was brought to Viking Terminal.\n\nBrian Swider, who rented space at the terminal from 1990 to 1995 for his concrete company, remembers the property’s owners — Kortbawi’s parents, Peter and Donna Roehsler — once had grand plans to restore the yacht to its former glory.\n\n“He was into his boats,” Swider said of Peter Roehsler, who died in 2011. Donna died in 2023.\n\n“They had a crew of people working on that yacht the whole time I was down there,” Swider continued. “They dumped a lot of time and money into it. To see it the way it is now — it’s a shame.”\n\nSwider said the Roehslers ordered new engine parts, but later discovered that the hull’s engine mounts were “beyond repair.”\n\n“That’s when he put it up in the creek there,” Swider said. “I lost track after I moved out.”\n\nSince then, the yacht remained largely — but not entirely — undisturbed.\n\nOther YouTubers have documented themselves aboard the vessel in recent years. In one popular 2020 video, now deleted, two men kayak directly up to it, crossing a makeshift gangway of PVC pipes and stepping onto the deck.\n\nThey explore the yacht, not yet covered in graffiti, and remark on the smell of stagnant water and decay.\n\n“Oh man, this thing is Stinkersville,” one says.\n\nThe other poses on the roof like Leonardo DiCaprio’s character in “Titanic,” arms flung wide: “I’m the king of the world!”\n\nNeither man has been charged with a crime, and neither responded to requests for comment.\n\nIt’s unclear if Kortbawi was aware of this video or others like it, and if so, why she didn’t file complaints in those cases.\n\nKortbawi is a civil litigation attorney and sits on the board of trustees of the Middlesex County Bar Association.\n\nShe left her commercial firm last November, according to her LinkedIn profile, which lists her current employment as owner of Viking Terminal Holdings, LLC.\n\n“How is it possible a prominent attorney has a derelict yacht sitting abandoned in a creek?” Dolitsky asks in an update video posted to his channel late last year.\n\nNew Jersey has long had a problem with abandoned boats. But the yacht in Sayreville probably doesn’t meet that definition.\n\nThat’s because Kortbawi owns both the vessel and the waterway in which it’s moldering.\n\nA public relations firm retained by the Borough of Sayreville told Patch last month that the yacht “is not abandoned” and “is owned by a private company.”\n\nStill, its rusting and rotting may pose an environmental risk to its surroundings, some say. Dolitsky believes it does, pointing to visible holes in the hull and flooded engine compartments.\n\n“When the water comes in and goes out, I can only imagine all the fluids that were in that yacht at some point leaked out,” he said. “Diesel, oil, things like that.”\n\nKortbawi told the Home News Tribune that those claims are baseless, noting that inspections by county and municipal agencies found no oil leakage.\n\nThe case has unfolded slowly since Dolitsky received his summons in June. A mediation session with Kortbawi preceded his probable cause hearing, but it collapsed almost immediately, he says.\n\n“I was willing to mediate — that’s why I was there,” he said. “But if one party doesn’t want to mediate, then it goes to trial.”\n\nDolitsky has had no other contact with Kortbawi, whose motivations remain unknown.\n\n“It’s not like, if they fine me, she gets the money,” he said. “I don’t know what she’s getting out of it. Maybe she wants to make an example out of me.”\n\nIn New Jersey’s municipal courts, anyone with firsthand knowledge of a violation can file a citizen complaint, and the court may hold a probable cause hearing to decide if the case moves forward.\n\nSayreville police were not involved in the charge, nor did they investigate the complaint, according to Lt. James Novak, a department spokesperson.\n\nIt’s unclear how much the case is costing Sayreville taxpayers to prosecute Dolitsky.\n\nA spokesperson for the borough did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did John Krenzel, the municipal prosecutor handling the case.\n\nThe drawn-out process has taken a toll on Dolitsky.\n\n“Who wants to have charges looming over their head?” he said. “Especially over something that, in my opinion, seems so petty.”\n\nOnline, the case has become a minor cause célèbre among fans of “urban exploration” videos and creators who see public waterways and abandoned structures as fair game.\n\nDolitsky, whose YouTube channel is his full-time career, insists he is not interested in controversy.\n\n“I care about what I do and where I go,” he said. “I try to leave places better than I find them. I’m not out there trying to cause harm.”",

    "description": "A grandmother reflects on spending three weeks caring for her grandkids and learning how parenting has changed since she raised her own children.",
    "fullText": "My grandchildren live 3000 miles away, so I don't get to see them nearly as often as I'd like. Recently, I took a three-week break from my regularly scheduled life to help take care of them while their nanny was away. My son and daughter-in-law both work full-time, and I was eager to pitch in and help with school runs, meal prep, baths, and bedtime.\n\nIt didn't seem that long ago that I was the primary caregiver for my five children, so the daily routine felt very familiar. So familiar, in fact, that it was easy to fall back into old patterns. However, my old routine from years ago did not work for these children. They had their own way of doing things, and it was my turn to adapt.\n\nMy granddaughter and I bonded immediately when we first met, just a few weeks after her birth. The next time I visited, she was 9 months old, that tricky age when babies become shy around strangers. My daughter-in-law warned me that she might not be receptive to my overtures of love. She proved us wrong. She immediately reached for me and snuggled deeply into my arms.\n\nOur connection has only grown since then. Despite my infrequent visits, she always eagerly greets me and monopolizes my time, which is fine with me.\n\nMy grandson, on the other hand, has taken a while to warm up to me. It wasn't until several days into this most recent visit that he allowed me to pick him up. We made our greatest connections when I fed him. I think we're friends now.\n\nOur mornings started differently when my kids were 5 and 2. No lollygagging in our house; just get up, get dressed, and eat breakfast before heading out the door. This household eases into the day more gently. I admit much of the urgency that dictated how I started out my days was a response to my fear of showing up anywhere late, a battle I still wage.\n\nMy granddaughter's school has a flexible start time with an anticipated arrival somewhere between 8:30 a.m. and 9 a.m. Even if she's late, there are no penalties.\n\nThe car ride to school proved to be quite challenging. I'd always encouraged my kids to look out the window and observe the world around them. This child preferred a few minutes playing games on my phone. It's one of the few times during the day she's allowed to interact with screens. It was tough to oblige, though, because I needed Google Maps to direct me to her school. We agreed that she could use the phone on the ride home in the afternoon, and peace was restored.\n\nCaring for a preschooler and a toddler requires skilled negotiations. In this household, I needed a primer from Mom and Day to learn what the bargaining chips were. More often than not, a promise of more time with their parents was the key to navigating our days together.\n\nI learned that the hard way on the day I promised my granddaughter she'd see her mom as soon as school ended. What I meant was as soon as we got home from school, not in the parking lot. She'd had such a broad smile as she bounced out of her classroom that immediately transformed into a pout when she realized Nana was picking her up, not her beloved Mama.\n\nMy son and daughter-in-law are truly doing a wonderful job raising their children. There is no reason for me to offer unsolicited advice about how to care for them. That became abundantly clear the morning I suggested my grandson take his nap in his crib instead of in his mother's arms. It was easy to see how tired she was and how his nap would give her a much-needed break, but the baby would only fall asleep in his mother's arms. My suggestion was not helpful.\n\nWe have much more fun together when I'm not in charge. It's a pleasure turning the responsibility back over to Mom and Dad so the children and I can paint, mold Play-Doh, and read books together.\n\nI want to be a helpful grandmother. I'll likely not stop offering suggestions on how to raise these two beautiful children, but I will shut my mouth when I see that what they're doing is working.",

OpenClaw, an open-source AI assistant that works inside platforms like WhatsApp, Slack, and iMessage, is an early example of digital agents communicating and coordinating with one another without direct human involvement.\n\n\"To me, this is a crystal ball into the wildness of the inevitable future,\" Simons told Business Insider. \"Your AI agents will talk to other people's agents on your behalf, negotiating pricing for a product you want to buy, inquiring about availability for a restaurant, arguing your political viewpoints.\"\n\n\"Agents are an extension of yourself,\" he added. \"People will generally trust their agents with whatever they recommend them to buy, reserve, believe, or otherwise.\"\n\nSimons's comments come as software and SaaS stocks have slumped in recent weeks, a move he attributes to growing investor recognition that AI can now build software autonomously. As AI tools become more capable, he said, long-standing competitive moats based on specialized knowledge are eroding.\n\nHe compared the shift to the transformation of manufacturing over the past century. Craft knowledge once protected businesses, he said, but automation and digital design ultimately displaced many incumbents. \"Today, it's a CAD file you can 3D print,\" Simons said.\n\n\"While every individual does not use these profound new powers directly (like 3D printing a chair), there's an entire new generation of companies that do — and they have replaced the previous era of companies,\" Simons explained. \"They disrupted those incumbents by leveraging automation that made it far cheaper and at a massive scale not possible previously when moats were just knowledge and bare hands.\"\n\nFor businesses, the implications are stark. Even traditionally \"safe\" enterprise software may be vulnerable if AI agents can migrate or rebuild systems rapidly.\n\n\"What does it mean when all of software can be written, rewritten, migrated, or otherwise, 100x or 10,000x faster than it could've ever been done before, by a workforce that does not sleep, and can be parallelized near infinitely?\" Simons said. \"It's daunting and mind-bending, and I think the repricing of SaaS in public markets more accurately reflects this today.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "Stellantis CEO tells employees to channel Silicon Valley office culture as it prepares for 5-day RTO",
    "description": "In leaked comments, CEO Antonio Filosa told Stellantis employees he was inspired by full-time office culture during a recent trip to San Francisco.",
    "fullText": "Automaker Stellantis is taking a page from Silicon Valley's \"hardcore\" culture when it comes to remote work.\n\nCEO Antonio Filosa told staff at a Friday all-hands that Stellantis could take inspiration from AI and software startups after it announced a five-day office return policy, according to a transcript an employee shared with Business Insider.\n\nResponding to an employee question about the RTO mandate, Filosa said he was further convinced about the benefits of in-office work by a trip to San Francisco at the start of the year, according to the transcript, the accuracy of which was confirmed to Business Insider by four other Stellantis employees.\n\nFilosa told employees that he connected with multiple software companies during the trip and saw many people working in the office.\n\nHe singled out a visit to AI startup Applied Intuition, which partners with Stellantis to develop vehicle infotainment systems, and said he was impressed by the software company's engineers working and collaborating full-time in the office.\n\nStellantis, which is a much larger company, should be just as focused on in-office collaboration, Filosa said, adding that he wanted employees to work together.\n\nA spokesperson for Stellantis told Business Insider that the company does not comment on internal business meetings.\n\nStellantis, whose US brands include Chrysler, Jeep, and Ram, as well as European automakers Fiat and Peugeot, told US employees late last month that they would be required to work five days in the office from March 30, Business Insider first reported. Employees outside the US are also set to return to the office full-time, but timing will vary by location.\n\nThe auto conglomerate was an early champion of remote work and introduced policies in 2022 allowing white-collar employees to work from home 70% of the time. Last year, it called staff back into the office at least three days a week.\n\nRival automaker Ford has also tightened its rules on remote work in recent months, calling employees back to the office at least four days a week and warning some they could face termination if they don't comply.\n\nThe crackdown echoes that of the tech industry, with companies like Amazon and Meta enforcing return-to-office requirements in recent years as part of a \"hardcore\" work culture that also emphasizes performance and efficiency.\n\nFilosa's town hall came as the former Jeep head, who was appointed Stellantis CEO in June 2025, battles to turn the company around after years of declining US sales.\n\nStellantis' stock price tumbled as much as 25% on Friday after the company reported a $26 billion charge as it resets its EV strategy amid an industry-wide demand slump.\n\nDo you work at Stellantis or have any information to share?

    "description": "I left Houston to live with my long-distance partner in a rural Canadian town. I worried the change would make me lonely, but I'm happier than ever.",
    "fullText": "Love made me leave behind a place right near my parents in Houston to join my partner in a town without a single restaurant.\n\nI'd first met my partner a decade earlier, but we'd reconnected more recently — while long-distance — over a shared love of stories, coffee, and baseball.\n\nFrom the beginning, it was clear that if we were to close the distance gap, it would be me who moved. I longed for a life closer to nature, away from the crowds, and where I could enjoy each season to the fullest — a life he was already living in rural Canada.\n\nAlthough I did love my life in Houston and my proximity to family, I was ready for a change.\n\nSo, last summer, my brother drove me from Houston to a rural township in central Canada, marking my very last great American road trip. He returned to the nearest major airport, and with him went my last direct link to home.\n\nI thought I'd be lonely and homesick, but my new life keeps me plenty busy, and Zoom calls help me manage the rest.\n\nGone were the days of apartment isolation and cringing at every rare, uninvited knock at the door. Instead, this new life dropped me straight into an established household where friends routinely check on their neighbors.\n\nI'd frequently visited the area before moving, so I knew a few of these folks already. Particular friends of my partner's — Marcie and Dan, a retired couple with two beautiful yellow labs who live just down the street — made me promise to drop by for coffee as soon as I could manage after moving.\n\nMarcie invited me to join her and her friend for bingo at the community center down the road. Not only did Marcie's friend end up winning a small stack of 20s, but the first snow of the season began as we drove.\n\nOn the way home, we commented on the diamond-like quality of the fallen snow in the headlights and made plans to get together again soon.\n\nAdd all of this in-person interaction to my lengthy list of Zoom buddies from home who had no problem joining me for regular virtual catch-ups, and community became no problem.\n\nI joked with my mom that I came out here to be a hermit, and instead found out I'll never have a day alone again.\n\nThere is a profound difference in pace between my old and new lives.\n\nWe haven't had a day without snow on the ground since sometime in November this season. It's not so easy to get out, especially in this weather, so I've found myself leaving the house less often — and spending more time out when I do.\n\nThe world was literally at my fingertips in Houston. A place so big and full of folks from around the world attracts every kind of restaurant, ingredient, and entertainment.\n\nWhy should I stock up my tiny apartment fridge when I could be at a Lebanese place in three minutes, the world's best taco spot in two, and a grocery store with every type of tofu imaginable in 10?\n\nNow, my basement freezer is my grocery store, and my hands set the table at the nearest restaurant: the dining room. With the closest major market over an hour away, I shop for a month at a time and reuse even the scraps of my food.\n\nCooking all of my meals has been a boon to both my wallet and my mental health. Nothing is easy or a given out here, but I've found I don't mind it. The lack of convenience out here is part of the charm.\n\nOne evening, after a daylong errand trip into the nearest sizable city, I climbed out of my car and heard a powerful roar.\n\nMy brain automatically assumed it was traffic from the bridge near my old apartment, years of city-girl conditioning activated. It took me a few seconds to remember that there's no traffic noise here. My partner calls this place the \"edge of Canada\" for a reason.\n\nMy entire body relaxed when I finally understood: The sound I heard was the wind rushing through the trees and kicking up snow.\n\nAll those years living in Houston, I ached for a place closer to nature, a place where I could distance myself from the noise of the city. At long last, here I am.\n\nThis has been the biggest lifestyle shift of my adulthood, and I'm the happiest I've ever been.",

    "title": "Gold bugs are going wild over a call for the metal's price to more than double. Here's what's behind the viral forecast.",
    "description": "A thesis that says financial conditions point to $12,595 for an ounce of gold was making the rounds on social media on Tuesday.",
    "fullText": "A new forecast for gold making the rounds online has stirred the goldbugs into a frenzy.\n\nThe precious metal has rallied to records for much of the last year, bouncing off the lows following its recent historic sell-off to continue pushing higher. Gold was trading around $5,060 per ounce on Tuesday, up 72% in the last 12 months.\n\nAccording to Dan Oliver, the founder of gold and silver mining sector-focused hedge fund Myrmikan Capital, current prices pale in comparison to where they should be if one major source of demand continues to rise.\n\nOliver's thesis centers on gold as a total percentage of central bank reserves.\n\n\"Historically, the market forced central banks to maintain gold reserves of between a third and a half, which would currently imply a price of between $8,395/oz and $12,595/oz,\" he stated in a note published on Monday.\n\nHe argues that gold could actually rise to closer to 100% of reserves in the event of a \"cleansing\" event that drives down the value of other holdings, such as US Treasurys.\n\n\"We don't claim that U.S. Treasuries are worthless, but they are certainly worth less than where the Fed-manipulated market prices them, and the longer-term bonds that the Fed owns are severely impaired, meaning that in a cleansing, gold as a percentage of the balance sheet must trade a lot higher than a third,\" Oliver wrote.\n\nHe argued that gold's rally is being driven by rising stress both in the US debt market and a strained global dollar system. In his view, foreign investors will continue to scale back their reliance on US dollar assets, forcing the Federal Reserve to stabilize the market through large-scale bond buying.\n\n\"This will be the second phase of the gold bull market, a move that has not yet begun, the move to reflect the market realization that the Fed is powerless to save private equity or control interest rates without buying the entire bond market.\"\n\nThe third phase will be a \"government bond death spiral,\" Oliver said.\n\n\"The higher the interest rates rise, the larger the interest payments go, the worse the deficits, the greater the supply of treasuries, and the higher rates will rise.\"\n\nOliver didn't provide a specific timeline for his forecast to unfold, but his analysis was enough to get gold bulls excited on social media.\n\n\"That is the best thing I have read all day, thank you!\" stated one user who describes himself as a 30-year derivatives veteran. Luke Gromen, founder of market research firm Forest for the Trees, cheered the forecast, while Brien Lundin, CEO of the New Orleans Investment Conference, described the post from Oliver as \"fantastic.\"\n\nEveryday traders have also embraced gold as prices have surged, causing some forecasters to compare its yearlong rally to what would be seen in meme stocks rather than precious metals.",

    "fullText": "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told senators on Tuesday that he had lunch on Jeffrey Epstein's private island in 2012. In October, Lutnick was quoted in the New York Post saying he'd decided to cut ties with Epstein in 2005.\n\nLutnick told the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that he had lunch with Epstein on Little Saint James, Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands, during a boat trip with his family.\n\n\"My wife was with me, as were my four children and nannies,\" Lutnick said. \"I had another couple with— they were there as well. with their children.\"\n\nLutnick said the lunch only lasted \"for an hour.\"\n\n\"We were on family vacation,\" Lutnick added. \"To suggest there was anything untoward about that, in 2012, I don't… I don't recall why we did it.\"\n\nThe comments came after Lutnick was asked about recent disclosures from the Department of Justice's ongoing release of the Epstein files, which indicated that the commerce secretary had contact with Epstein after 2008, when the financier pleaded guilty to procuring a minor for prostitution and soliciting a prostitute.\n\nVAN HOLLEN: Did you in fact make the visit to Epstein's private island?\n\nLUTNICK: I did have lunch with him as I was on a boat going across on a family vacation. My wife was with me as were my 4 children and nannies. I had another couple with their children. And we had lunch on… pic.twitter.com/o6GGyNsr5M\n\nThe two had several calls and meetings over drinks scheduled in 2011, the emails show.\n\nEmail exchanges in the files show Lutnick planning to visit the island with his family and friends in December 2012.\n\n\"We are landing in St. Thomas early Saturday afternoon and planning to head over to St. Bart's/Anguilla on Monday at some point,\" Lutnick wrote to Epstein in an email. \"Where are you located (what is exact location for my captain)? Does Sunday evening for dinner sound good?\"\n\nBoth Epstein and Lutnick purchased shares of a now-closed advertising technology company later that month, according to records that were originally reported by CBS News.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Post published in October, Lutnick said that he decided to cut off ties with Epstein in 2005 after visiting his Manhattan home and being shown his massage table. The two men were neighbors at the time.\n\n\"My wife and I decided that I will never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again,\" Lutnick told the Post. \"So I was never in the room with him socially, for business, or even philanthropy. If that guy was there, I wasn't going, 'cause he's gross.\"\n\nA Commerce Department spokesperson said in a statement that \"Mr. and Mrs. Lutnick met Jeffrey Epstein in 2005 and had very limited interactions with him over the next 14 years.\"\n\n\"This is nothing more than a failing attempt by the legacy media to distract from the administration's accomplishments including securing Trillions of dollars in investment, delivering historic trade deals and fighting for the American worker,\" the spokesperson said in an email.\n\nAsked about the testimony later on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Lutnick \"remains a very important member of President Trump's team, and the president fully supports the secretary.\"\n\nLutnick has faced calls to resign from lawmakers on Capitol Hill over the revelations of his association with Epstein.\n\nWhile most of those calls have come from Democrats, Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky has also said Lutnick should go.\n\n\"He should just resign,\" Massie said in a CNN interview.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Monica Aksamit. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I ask people how much they thought I earned as a US Olympian, they always guess an amount far above what I actually got paid.\n\nDuring the years I was part of the US fencing team from 2016 to 2021, I made $300 a month. This was the pinnacle of my fencing career, and yet I wasn't making enough to cover my living expenses.\n\nBut this had always been my dream, and I had to pursue it at all costs.\n\nI'd been fencing since I was about 8. My mom, a Polish immigrant, had signed me up after a client of hers suggested she bring me along to a practice. He said there was a scholarship opportunity if I did well, and my mom was hooked.\n\nFencing was a great outlet for me during my parents' divorce. Most kids get yelled at for hitting other kids — I was being applauded for it.\n\nMy mom financially supported my fencing. She put herself into credit card debt to ensure we could pay for equipment, travel, practices, and tournaments.\n\nI remember her once telling one of my coaches that she couldn't afford to bring me to practices anymore. The coach told her to just pay what she could. He wanted me to chase this dream and saw potential. My road to the Olympics wouldn't have been possible without him.\n\nAs I got a bit older, I started winning competitions, and with that came prize money. My mom's sacrifice, the coach's generosity, and the prize money kept me pushing forward.\n\nAfter watching the 2004 Olympics in Greece, I became fixated on the idea of one day competing on the US Olympic fencing team. It was the first Olympic Games that my event, the women's saber, was added. Nowadays, they're a lot more lenient with adding events — but it wasn't like that then — it was a big deal.\n\nThat year, I sat on my grandparents' couch in Poland and watched, telling them one day, I'd become an Olympian. It was a crazy dream, and that time, my mom didn't necessarily think I'd achieve it, but she kept paving the way for me to get there.\n\nWhen I graduated from college in 2012, my main goal was to get to the Olympics. But now, I was an adult and had to fund it myself.\n\nI alone had to pay for a big portion of the competitions, travel, and all of my own living expenses. I stayed at home because there was no way I could afford to pursue my dream while paying rent.\n\nI worked endlessly as a fencing coach and a referee at tournaments. I handed out flyers for companies and took low-end modelling gigs.\n\nMy fencing club and those who contributed to my GoFundMe continued to financially support me along the way, helping fund my dream.\n\nIn 2016, I qualified for the US Olympic team. Team USA started covering all of my tournaments, training camps, and travel. But I was only given a monthly salary of $300.\n\nThere wasn't any way I could take on another job because what employer was going to let me take several weeks off throughout the year to train and compete?\n\nMy only option was to take out credit cards to fund what I needed to achieve my dream — car insurance, train travel into the city to train, food, bills, and any extras I did. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I didn't want money to be the reason I couldn't achieve what I had worked so long for.\n\nPeople are shocked when I tell them how much I made each month as an Olympian and how I went into debt to represent the US on an international stage.\n\nIt did eventually pay off. I took home a bronze medal at Rio in 2016, but I'm still paying off my credit cards from those years of training and competing with Team USA.\n\nAfter Rio, I put on a fundraiser to cover the costs of getting to Tokyo 2020, and people generously donated enough to go over my goal — it was the only way to fund my Olympic dreams as someone who didn't come from money.",

    "fullText": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff angered some employees by making jokes about Immigration and Customs Enforcement during a company event, according to internal messages viewed by Business Insider.\n\nSalesforce's employee-only \"Company Kickoff\" is happening this week in Las Vegas. The event is also livestreamed internally. Business Insider did not view the livestream.\n\nSalesforce did not immediately reply to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nDozens of Slack messages say that Benioff made \"multiple\" jokes about ICE agents, including about ICE surveilling employee travel.\n\n\"A joke about ICE surveilling employees' travel, when there are literally employees afraid to travel for work due to current situation,\" one employee wrote, according to a screenshot viewed by Business Insider.\n\n\"It's hard to believe this company still has values when you make completely off-base jokes about ICE in your opening keynote,\" another employee wrote. \"That's unacceptable.\"\n\n\"I'm deeply disappointed and uncomfortable that two jokes about ICE were made in the first few minutes of Marc's opening keynote,\" a third employee wrote. \"The fact that the first was made after welcoming our teammates who traveled from outside the US? Even worse. We have many great things to be proud of and stand behind at this company, but these tasteless, insensitive jokes have made it hard to focus on that message. I'm going to have to take a break from watching to regroup.\"\n\nThe comments come after Salesforce earlier this month laid off some employees and appointed new leaders to replace five high-profile leaders who have announced departures since December.\n\nBenioff previously suggested that President Donald Trump should deploy the National Guard to San Francisco ahead of the company's Dreamforce conference. He later apologized.\n\nIt's not the first time Benioff faced backlash from staff for his comments at company meetings.\n\nAfter Salesforce announced plans to cut 10% of its workforce in 2023, Benioff launched into a meandering two-hour talk that some employees characterized as \"tone-deaf.\" He joked at the time about the layoffs ruining one executive's birthday and about being \"thrilled\" about the coronavirus pandemic for allowing him to work from home.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "The 10 best dress pants for men, from stretchy performance pants to traditional wool trousers",
    "description": "Dress pants are a must-have menswear staple, whether you wear them daily or not. The best pairs for men are timeless in style and comfortable to wear.",
    "fullText": "The best dress pants for men should look clean and sophisticated, whether worn in a business casual setting, on date night, or at a social event. They should also be comfortable and easy to clean. Great dress pants are a critical part of any wardrobe, because even the most stylish dress shirt needs a strong supporting cast.\n\nOur favorite pair is from Mizzen+Main, a menswear brand we love for its comfortable and stretchy office clothes. The Mizzen+Main Helmsman Chino pants are stretchy, lightweight, and breathable, while still looking traditional, which makes them ideal for warmer summer weather. Below, we've rounded up the best dress pants for men, an essential element in any workwear wardrobe.\n\nLightweight takes on a whole new meaning with these airy, four-way stretch pants you've got to try on to believe.\n\nThis versatile pair of chinos features invisible side seams and an elastic waist in dense cotton twill that is wrinkle and dust resistant.\n\nThe Gamechanger Rec Pant is as stretchy and comfortable as your favorite sweatpants, but looks like traditional dress pants.\n\nLightweight takes on a whole new meaning with these airy, four-way stretch pants you've got to try on to believe.\n\nEven the best dress pants can sometimes feel cumbersome in extreme heat, but Mizzen + Main seems to have the right response figured out. Featuring a four-way stretch blend of polyester and spandex that feels light as air and breathes easily, the Helmsman Chinos are incredibly comfortable, while retaining the polished look of a traditional five-pocket chino. They're also designed to resist wrinkles, which is great for staying sharp all day long. All of that, plus the added benefit of many colors available, makes them the best we've tested — especially if you want to fill out your wardrobe for the work week.\n\nThis versatile pair of chinos features invisible side seams and an elastic waist in dense cotton twill that is wrinkle and dust resistant.\n\nUniqlo is known for its stylish staples at affordable prices, and the Slim-Fit Chinos are no different. They feature side-seam detailing, like classic dress pants, plus a relatively tailored slim-straight cut. We also love that Uniqlo offers free alterations if the off-the-rack sizing needs to be tweaked to your liking. While they're not as stretchy or wrinkle-resistant as performance pairs, they're comfortable enough for daily wears, and the price tag makes it easy to buy multiple pairs at once.\n\nThe Gamechanger Rec Pant is as stretchy and comfortable as your favorite sweatpants, but looks like traditional dress pants.\n\nPublic Rec's Gamechanger Rec Pants are designed to be as comfortable as sweatpants, but with specific waist and inseam sizes, they'll fit perfectly like dress pants. The material is incredibly stretchy, which is excellent for mobility, comfort, and resisting wrinkles. If you've been looking for the cheat code to wearing sweatpants to your corporate office, this is it.\n\nRead our full review of the Public Rec Gamechanger Rec Pant.\n\nMade with 100% wool, the Lakeshore pants feature a slim fit with a timeless pinstriped pattern.\n\nWool can sometimes be famously uncomfortable, but The Tie Bar's Lakeshore Pants feature a brushed finish that keeps them soft and comfortable against the skin. The streamlined cut through the hips and thighs keeps the look modern and flattering without being too tight for most men. The striped pattern leans into the classic satorial styling, but leaves room for more casual alternative outfits. If you are going for a fully polished look, you can pair them with The Tie Bar's Lakeshore Jacket for an affordably priced, complete suit.\n\nDress pants remained essentially unchanged for years, often made of classic wool, until  Ministry of Supply came along and changed the game. They've quite literally engineered a new way to think about dress pants, using wrinkle-resistant, 4-way stretch fabric boasting next-level features like natural odor control. Yet, they still feature timeless dress pant details like front slash pockets and two clean, sharp fit options. They should be comfortable enough for all-day wear and even business travel.\n\nRead more about the Ministry of Supply in our review of the best work clothes for men,\n\nSome dress pants separate themselves from the pack with a super-crisp design. In fact, it's hard not to love sharp, dressy, creased-front pants. The BOSS brand and its subsets, like the Genius line, specialize in these. Wool fabric is elevated even further with a comfortable stretch, turning these into comfortable pants fit for day-to-night wear.\n\nIndochino is known for its custom, made-to-measure menswear. You've got the world of premium tailored style at your fingertips, so to speak, with customizable options from Indochino. It's easier and more efficient than ever to add a little flair to your rotation of the best dress pants for men, with customizable fabric and lining options available. And seeing as these pants already come in Indochino's excellent cashmere blend, you're already starting at a proper jumping-off point.\n\nThe Apparel Skyline Pants are an eye-catching take on classic men's dress pants.\n\nY.Chroma Apparel is all about reimagining what you thought you knew about menswear. The brand is bold and vibrant, taking cues from surf and skate culture yet putting a refined spin on those typically youthful pursuits. That approach manifests itself in the visually appealing Skyline Pants, which are classic enough to wear with chunky leather loafers and edgy enough to wear with beat-up dress boots. They're stitched in Bulgaria from a blend of cotton and Italian elastane, and Y.Chroma's color selection is simply immaculate.\n\nSqueezing into suit pants or finding dress pants that fit was once a chore for guys with larger thighs and a more athletic build. And yet, State and Liberty was founded with a laser-sharp focus on solving that problem, from blazers to dress shirts and these expertly cut dress pants. The performance-blend fabric moves with you and offers a tapered fit with plenty of room (but not too much), while these can easily be paired with a State and Liberty blazer for a cool, tailored look.\n\nIs it possible for a pair of the best dress pants to actually be, well — more casual? In the hands of Mugsy, the answer is a resounding yes. The brand's thin wale stretch corduroy boasts the eye-catching texture of corduroy, but the lightweight stretch fabric makes them a reliable option for chilly fall and winter days, too. Plus, the five-pocket design and washed-out colorway are both slightly more laidback if you prefer a pair of dress pants with a (slightly) more easygoing look.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

Department of Defense contractor Brashad Johnson, 36, was reportedly one of 30 suspects arrested in an undercover operation in Minnesota targeting people allegedly attempting to pay for sex. “This is the most disturbing arrest that we’ve had here,” Booker Hodgers, police chief in Bloomington, Minnesota, said of Johnson’s arrest.“He is a backgrounder for ICE, Homeland Security, and federal agencies. So when you’re getting your security clearance, this is one of the guys that does your backgrounds, which is kind of scary.”",

    "description": "After AI battered the software sector last week, a new tax-planning tool from Altruist sparked fresh fears of disruption in financials.",
    "fullText": "Another week, another round of jitters caused by fears of widespread AI disruption.\n\nOn Tuesday, financial firms and brokerages saw their shares fall as tech firm Altruist boasted its new Hazel AI tool could assist with tax planning for clients \"within minutes.\"\n\nHere were the big moves on Tuesday:\n\nThe iShares U.S. Broker-Dealers & Securities Exchanges ETF was down 4%.\n\nThe fear isn't explicitly tied to the tax services these companies provide, but rather that cheap AI tools will soon be more widely available for a range of financial services offered by big companies, eating into margins.\n\nIt's a nearly identical fear that shook the software space last week. After Anthropic rolled out new tools for its Cowork agent aimed at professionals in the legal space, the entire sector sold off as investors eyed the potential for wider disruption.\n\nOther brokerage stocks, such as Interactive Brokers and Morgan Stanley, fared slightly better on Tuesday. The fact that both firms cater to institutional traders implies that Wall Street is more concerned about retail-facing brokerage stocks.\n\nCompanies in the accounting space, such as QuickBooks owner Intuit, fell about 3%. Accounting software makers SAP SE and Xero rose 1% and 2% respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI approved the integration of an AI application on ChatGPT to enable users to receive direct insurance quotes on the platform.\n\nNeither platform directly offers users the ability to trade stocks, but for the market, the key concern is that AI disruption is poised to upend the financial sector, as it did the legal technology field last week.\n\nMarkets have largely recovered from the tech plunge last week, with multiple analysts saying this week that the event represents a buy-the-dip moment. Still, markets are on edge as new disruptive tools continue to emerge.",

    "fullText": "I grew up watching the Food Network and always loved Ina Garten for her laid-back attitude and approach to cooking. When I was a 20-something in New York City, I relied on her recipes to transport me to other destinations without ever leaving my apartment.\n\nFor example, I found her roasted shrimp and orzo recipe nearly 20 years ago and have been making it ever since. These days, it's a go-to for feeding my family of four a quick, nutritious, and delicious meal.\n\nI love its simplicity, fresh flavors, and the fact that it's always a crowd-pleaser. Here's how I make it.\n\nTo make Garten's roasted shrimp and orzo recipe, which serves six, I grabbed:\n\nAfter gathering my ingredients, I realized I forgot to buy a lemon, so I substituted it with white-wine vinegar.\n\nI used frozen shrimp for convenience, and let them defrost in the fridge for a few hours before cooking. Once I took them out, I patted them dry and tossed them in olive oil, salt, and pepper.\n\nI spread them out on a pan with foil and roasted them in my toaster oven at 400 degrees Fahrenheit. The recipe says to do this for six minutes, but I did it just a little bit longer.\n\nI cooked the orzo according to the package directions, drained it, and sprayed it lightly with olive oil to prevent it from sticking together.\n\nWhile that was cooking, I chopped the red onion, cucumber, parsley, dill, and green onion.\n\nTo make this super simple dressing, I mixed white wine vinegar, olive oil, salt, and pepper together.\n\nI piled the orzo, shrimp, veggies, feta, and herbs on top of the dressing and tossed them all together.\n\nI often make this recipe the day I eat it, and it tastes amazing when it's warm and freshly mixed. However, it's also fantastic once the flavors have had a little while to marinate, so sometimes, I let it sit in the fridge overnight.\n\nOne of my favorite things about this recipe is that it can easily be modified. As a mom, I've changed the recipe up to suit the tastes of my toddler and preschooler.\n\nFor example, if I want them to eat more veggies, I'll toss in whatever I have on hand — like red peppers or tomatoes.\n\nAnd, I usually pile a scoop of this over spinach or arugula for myself, for an easy boost of greens.\n\nOverall, this recipe is such a solid base to work from — and one of the easiest ways to get a filling, nutritious weeknight meal on the table that my kids will enjoy.\n\nThis story was originally published on October 7, 2025, and most recently updated on February 10, 2026.",

    "description": "Mark Zuckerberg owns over 1,200 acres of land. Here's a look at the Facebook founder's US properties, from a Hawaii bunker to Lake Tahoe houses.",
    "fullText": "Mark Zuckerberg is one of the world's richest people, and his multimillion-dollar real estate portfolio reflects that.\n\nThe man responsible for Facebook is worth an estimated $231 billion, Forbes reported, and part of that fortune includes assets like a sprawling California compound and acres of lush land on a Hawaiian island.\n\nZuckerberg's real estate dealings are often shrouded in privacy, including the use of limited-liability companies and addresses linked to the investment management firm Iconiq Capital.\n\nHis most recent real estate deal, as reported by The Wall Street Journal, is a mansion on Indian Creek, an exclusive South Florida island that's home to other tech titans like Jeff Bezos. Representatives for Zuckerberg at Meta declined to comment to Business Insider.\n\nOver the years, Zuckerberg has bought and sold homes all over the country. He's also reportedly built some — a Hawaiian doomsday ranch that has had many scratching their heads, for example.\n\nHere's what we know about his real estate portfolio.\n\nIt's no surprise that a tech titan has more than one property in Silicon Valley. The Meta CEO owns five homes in the Crescent Park neighborhood of Palo Alto.\n\nHe gave viewers a rare peek inside one of them in 2016; the house is even tricked out with a \"custom-made artificially intelligent assistant,\" according to CNBC. The home is only a 10-minute drive from the Meta HQ in Menlo Park.\n\nArchitectural Digest described it as a \"'no frills abode\" that chooses function over extravagance. Zuckerberg then spent over $43 million on the four homes surrounding his original residence in Crescent Park, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe four-bedroom, four-bathroom home is located near San Francisco's Dolores Park. He and his wife, Priscilla Chan, reportedly spent $10 million to purchase the townhouse in 2010.\n\nAt the time of the sale in 2022, it was the largest residential real estate deal in the city.\n\nLake Tahoe is a popular vacation destination for wealthy Californians in both summer and winter, and Zuckerberg and his family are no exception.\n\nThe tax records of the two properties — known as Carousel Estate and Brushwood Estate — display the same address as tax records of other properties linked to Zuckerberg, according to documents viewed by BI.\n\nAt 5,322 square feet, the Brushwood Estate features six bedrooms, five baths, and two half baths, according to SF Gate. Inside are high-beamed ceilings and picture windows; outside are lush trees, a private dock, and a hot tub. There's also a 2,293-square-foot guesthouse.\n\nIt's unclear exactly how many acres of land Zuckerberg currently owns on Kauai, but he began buying up a region of the island back in 2014.\n\nBusiness Insider tracked down at least 1,200 acres between 17 parcels of land that have the same tax address as other properties mentioned above, but are owned by LLCs including Kahu'aina Holdings LLC and Pila'a International LLC.\n\nThe 1,200 acres include about 750 acres he reportedly paid $100 million in 2014 for. That encompasses a more than 350-acre span of land on Pila'a Beach.\n\nAnother part of Zuckerberg's Hawaii holdings is the nearly 600 acres of land on Kauai's North Shore that reportedly cost him around $53 million in 2021.\n\nOn one of his Hawaiian parcels, Zuckerberg is reportedly building a huge compound that's said to include a 5,000-square-foot underground bunker with an escape hatch. It's been dubbed Koolau Ranch, and Wired reported that buying the land and creating the compound cost the executive an estimated $270 million.\n\nAs Silicon Valley continues to infiltrate Washington, DC, Zuckerberg established a residence in the US capital, Politico said. The home that's reportedly his new pad is situated in Massachusetts Avenue Heights, not far from the Naval Observatory and the Washington National Cathedral, according to Builder magazine.\n\nZuckerberg kept the purchase private, Politico said. The mansion in question was sold for $23 million in cash. It was designed by local firm Robert Gurney Architect and sits on about one acre of property.\n\nBusiness Insider was unable to independently confirm that Zuckerberg purchased the property.\n\nMark Zuckerberg is reportedly adding a second East Coast property to his portfolio after buying a home in Miami, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nZuckerberg is purchasing a waterfront mansion on Indian Creek, an exclusive island in South Florida that's home to Jeff Bezos, Carl Icahn, and Jared Kushner.\n\nThe sold home previously belonged to a limited liability company linked to Peter Cancro, the founder of Jersey Mike's Subs. The property — which was just a home lot — was last traded for $37 million in 2021, Miami-Dade property records show.\n\nIt's unclear how much this off-market deal was worth, but an empty lot next door to Bezos sold for $105 million in 2025.\n\nHillary Hoffower contributed to an earlier version of this story.",

    "title": "As Silver Prices Plunge, This CIO Warns That Precious Metals Are Nothing More Than Meme Stocks",
    "description": "The CIO at the Haverford Trust says dividend stocks are better choices than commodities. Here are two options for investors.",
    "fullText": "Precious metals have long been seen as a safe haven during any market uncertainty. And as the stock market flashes the occasional warning sign of stress, these commodities have been big winners over the last year. Gold prices are up 77% over the last 12 months, and the price of silver has done even better, rising 153%.\n\nBut it’s also noteworthy that both gold and silver stumbled lately. Gold dropped nearly 13% from its late January high before making a mild recovery; silver tumbled 31% from its high of $114 and is now drifting at $80.\n\nAs Crypto Collapses, Buy This 1 Trillion-Dollar Dividend Stock Instead\n\nForget High Yield: This Dividend King Is up Nearly 900%\n\n1 High-Yield Dividend Stock That’s Up 148% Over the Past Year\n\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. \n\nThat’s why a warning from Hank Smith, the CIO of Haverford Trust, is getting attention these days.  He warns that investors should be cautious about putting money into gold, silver, or any commodity. He says the run higher in 2025 and early this year is more fueled by momentum instead of substance, and investors should instead consider stocks that offer yield, such as dividend stocks.\n\n\"Those (commodities) are speculations. They're not investments,\" he told Business Insider. “Because physical commodities do not have earnings, they don't have an income statement, a balance sheet, they don't pay dividends or interest—you’re buying that with the expectation that someone's going to come along and buy at a higher price. That's the only way you're going to make money.”\n\nSmith has a point—investors should never, ever consider putting all their investments into a single class such as commodities. And while I believe that gold, silver, and even cryptocurrency have a place in a well-diversified portfolio, I agree that investors should have the bulk of their investments in the stock market, looking for yield.\n\nHere are two ways to capitalize on that strategy through exchange-traded funds. Each has a different strategy but is geared toward providing yield through proven strategies.\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) is one of the most popular dividend ETFs on the market, with $78.5 billion in net assets and trading volume of nearly 20 million shares per day.\n\nThe fund tracks the total return of the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, which includes U.S.-based dividend-paying stocks. The fund focuses on large-cap value stocks that provide stable returns and dividend growth—ideal for any investor seeking consistent yield.",

Israel has only allowed a fraction of the essential equipment needed for cooking, heating, and construction to enter the Strip. Gaza is now buried beneath 680 million tons of rubble. Ninety percent of the population has been displaced, many of them several times. Hundreds of thousands live in threadbare tents.\n\nThe “ceasefire” is meant to breed apathy among us; the spectacle of modern genocidal warfare has been replaced by the slow bureaucratic proceedings of ethnic cleansing. Washington’s hollow promises to bring “technocratic governance” to Gaza mask a colonial project imposed on a people with no say: a people left to die, forgotten by the world.\n\nThis, then, is where we return. In early February, The Nation gave over its website for a day to writers from Gaza. We did this to make it clear that we will remain focused on Gaza and the Palestinian people. No diplomatic proceedings or political distortions will subdue our demand for their right to self-determination—or their right to speak for themselves.\n\nThe pieces in this series are an affirmation of that right: a record of Gaza’s refusal, in the face of the world’s neglect, to be exterminated.\n\n—Rayan El Amine, Lizzy Ratner, and Jack Mirkinson\n\nRayan El Amine, Jack Mirkinson, Lizzy Ratner\n\nToday, The Nation is turning over its website exclusively to stories from Gaza and its people. This is why.\n\nThe language of ceasefire has been repurposed in Gaza: It no longer describes a pause in violence but rather a mechanism for managing it.\n\nWhat I saw walking one block in Gaza.\n\nRecording what has been erased—and making sense of what remains.\n\nJournalists in Gaza have bartered their lives to tell a truth that much of the world still doesn’t want to hear.\n\nOn Palestine and the geography of vanishing.\n\nRewaa was killed by an Israeli bomb. Her absence has broken me in ways I still cannot describe.\n\nThese pictures are records of a genocidal war, but they are something more, too—they are fragments of Gaza itself.\n\nFaced with endlessly narrowing possibilities, I return to my diary in an attempt to dream, to imagine a future.\n\nAfter their home was obliterated, Rasha Abou Jalal and her family remain determined to build a new one, even if it must be built out of nothing.\n\nHamada Abu Layla spent 22 years gathering three university degrees. Now they mock him from a garbage dump.\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "fullText": "You may recognize US figure skater Ilia Malinin from his gravity-defying backflips and quadruple jumps.\n\nOr perhaps you know him simply as the \"Quad God.\"\n\nMalinin, 21, is a two-time world champion and one of Team USA's breakout figure skating stars of the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics.\n\nHere's what to know about Malinin's background and Olympic career.\n\nMalinin's parents, Tatiana Malinina and Roman Skorniakov, were born in Russia and represented Uzbekistan at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano and the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City.\n\nNow, they serve as his coaches.\n\nMalinin was born in Fairfax, Virginia, and began figure skating at 7 years old.\n\nMalinin's younger sister, Ellie \"Liza\" Beatrice Malinina, is also a competitive figure skater.\n\nHe trains in Reston, Virginia. When he's not figure skating, he's a student at the nearby George Mason University majoring in exploratory studies.\n\nMalinin is the first and only skater to ever land a quadruple axel in competition, and began using the nickname \"Quad God\" when he was 13 years old.\n\nMalinin helped Team USA secure the gold medal in the team figure skating competition on Sunday. He landed five quadruple jumps in his free skate, but has yet to attempt a quadruple axel at the 2026 Olympics. While he had planned to execute a quadruple axel during the Team Event, he substituted a triple axel instead.\n\nMalinin has also included backflips in his Olympic routines — a feat with a complicated history.\n\nDuring the 1976 Olympics, American figure skater Terry Kubicka performed the first-ever backflip, but the International Skating Union banned the move shortly thereafter in 1977, saying it was too dangerous.\n\nIn 1998, French figure skater Surya Bonaly became the first Olympic figure skater to land a backflip on one blade during her free skate, but was penalized by the judges since the move was still illegal in competition.\n\nThe International Skating Union lifted the ban on backflips in 2024. During the Team Event this year, Malinin landed a backflip on one skate just as Bonaly had, but this time, it was permitted.\n\nMalinin is believed to be the highest-paid figure skater at the 2026 Olympics with an estimated income of $700,000 from sponsorships over the last year, Forbes reported.\n\nAccording to Malinin's website, his corporate partners include Coca-Cola, Samsung, Google, Xfinity, Dick's Sporting Goods, and Honda.\n\nHaving already won gold in the team competition, Malinin will skate in the individual Men's Short Program on February 10 and the individual Men's Free Skate on February 13.\n\nSee Business Insider's full guide to watching Olympic figure skating",

    "fullText": "Boston Dynamics' Robert Playter is stepping down as CEO after six years in the role and more than 30 years with the company, according to a staff memo he sent to employees on Tuesday.\n\nPlayter's last day will be February 27, the memo said. Amanda McMaster, Boston Dynamics' chief financial officer, will serve as interim CEO, while the company board searches for its next chief executive, Playter wrote.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Boston Dynamics said Playter had guided the company from its early days of \"hopping robots\" to Spot, the quadruped robot.\n\n\"He transformed Boston Dynamics from a small research and development lab into a successful business that now proudly calls itself the global leader in mobile robotics,\" the company said in the statement. \"He will be sorely missed, but we hope he enjoys some well-deserved time off. Thanks, Rob.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Boston Dynamics said Playter will not play any advisory role and will be spending time off with his friends and family.\n\nPlayter's retirement comes on the heels of Boston Dynamics' unveiling of Atlas, a six-foot-tall humanoid robot, and in the midst of a global humanoid robot race.\n\nAtlas has been advertised as the factory worker of the future. Hyundai, which owns a majority stake in Boston Dynamics, said it expected the robot to hit the factory floor by 2028, starting with simpler tasks.\n\n\"We've been doing this for a long time. But for us to be approaching a point where we're really thinking about commercializing the humanoid, I don't know that we expected that years ago,\" Playter told Business Insider at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.\n\nPlayter first joined Boston Dynamics in 1994, shortly after pursuing a Ph.D. in aerospace engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nDuring his tenure, Playter saw the robotics startup change multiple hands. The company was first acquired by Google, then SoftBank, and most recently by Hyundai Motor Group.\n\nPlayter told Business Insider he was overseeing a team of nearly 1,100 people.\n\nRead the memo Playter sent to staff on Tuesday:",

    "fullText": "While Indiana officials play up their efforts to lure the Chicago Bears across the border for a new stadium, Gov. JB Pritzker said Monday that he and his staff have made “progress” to incentivize the football team to stay in Illinois.\n\nThe governor’s comments come as Pritzker’s January calendar shows he had two scheduled conversations with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell while Goodell was in Chicago for the Bears-Packers playoff game on Jan. 10.\n\nDuring his time here for the game, Goodell joined Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren and Chair George McCaskey on a tour of the Arlington Heights site the team owns, and sites in northwest Indiana, including one near Wolf Lake in Hammond.\n\nThe first conversation between the governor and Goodell was a scheduled half-hour phone call on Jan. 9, while the second was a half-hour discussion between the two on Jan. 12, according to the governor’s calendar entries. The governor’s office on Monday declined to comment on how the conversations went or what was said.\n\nBut the scheduled talks underscore that efforts surrounding the Bears stadium have not gone dormant, even though the team said in December it was exploring a move to northwest Indiana after negotiations with Pritzker and his Democratic allies in the Illinois General Assembly hit a lull.\n\nThe key sticking points in Illinois have been over how the state would legislatively or financially aid the team in its desire to build a stadium in Chicago’s northwest suburbs. In particular, topics have evolved around assistance for infrastructure around a proposed Arlington Heights stadium, property tax certainty for the team and payment of debt for the Soldier Field renovations done more than 20 years ago at the team’s behest.\n\nSources familiar with the discussions between the Bears and state of Illinois officials said both sides have been meeting regularly since early December to hammer out legislation for this spring’s legislative session in Springfield. The talks have been in line with public infrastructure improvements for or around the Bears stadium site in Arlington Heights and so-called megaprojects legislation that would make it easier for the Bears to negotiate with local governments over property taxes, sources said. In addition, the governor’s office has sought for the Bears to implement measures to make games more affordable, the sources said.\n\nSince the Bears’ December announcement that opened the door to a stadium across the border, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun has said his administration was “working hard” to attract the Bears and has pushed a bill to establish a state authority to “acquire, construct, equip, own, lease, and finance” a sports stadium.\n\nBut on Monday, Pritzker, during an unrelated news conference in southwest Illinois, cast an optimistic tone when he described Illinois officials’ relationship with the Bears these days.\n\n“There’s a lot of discussion, a lot of ongoing conversation with the Bears, and indeed, frankly, progress that’s been made. So I’m pleased about that,” he said in Belleville, where he and other lawmakers talked about a bond program meant to spur economic development in Illinois communities. “But I’m going to let the Bears talk about what it is that they want to get done and how they want to get it done. And I’m obviously involved in negotiations and so are my entire team, as well as the members of the legislature.”\n\nThe Tribune reported that in late December, Pritzker’s office signed a new $25,000 contract with an outside attorney to continue advising the administration in negotiations with the Bears through the end of June.\n\nPritzker on Monday also reiterated his position on the Bears’ quest for state incentives that he does not want taxpayer money paying for the stadium itself but would be willing to use state money to help the team with infrastructure funding, which generally includes improvements to roads and other transportation-related initiatives.\n\n“We are helping businesses build infrastructure, for example, which they would need, and other things that are sort of available, again, to any business that is growing or building something new in the state of Illinois that’s putting people to work,” the governor said. “You know, those are normal incentives, and that’s what I would expect that we will end up with the Bears, you know, depending on where it goes.”\n\nA team consultant estimated last year that infrastructure improvements from near Illinois Route 53 and changes to a nearby Metra train line could cost more than $850 million in public funds. What’s more, the Bears would likely need megaproject legislation that would allow them to negotiate with local governments over property tax bills.\n\nAnother issue for Bears officials is more than $500 million in outstanding public debt from the controversial 2003 Soldier Field renovation, a tab currently covered by city hotel taxes and, when that falls short, by Chicago’s share of state income taxes. The Bears’ lease at Soldier Field expires in 2033, but it can be broken early with a penalty, and the team says it will take three years to build its new stadium.\n\nBut even with the debt paid off, that alone might not be enough to satisfy state lawmakers who represent swaths of Chicago and are reluctant to incentivize the team to move out of the city limits, even if it’s to Arlington Heights.\n\nIn Springfield a few weeks ago, Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch, a Democrat from Hillside, sent out a survey to other House Democrats about where they stand on the Bears issue. The results of that survey were not available.\n\nAs for whether he’s taking the Bears’ interest in relocating to Indiana seriously, Pritzker said Monday, “I never take anything as if it’s a bluff.”\n\n“I mean, I’m always concerned about making sure that we’re attracting businesses or keeping businesses in the state of Illinois,” he said. “So we’re in consistent conversation with the Chicago Bears — have been, by the way, for, I don’t know, a year and a half or two years. And specifically, I think there’s a real possibility that many of the things that we put on the table to work with the Bears on are things that they’re willing to do to stay in the state of Illinois.”",

    "fullText": "The ride-hailing company's stock dipped 16% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after it reported fourth-quarter earnings and a 2026 outlook that fell short of expectations.\n\nLyft's revenue rose 3% to $1.59 billion during the quarter, below the $1.76 billion that analysts expected. Its guidance for the first quarter also missed the mark as it said it expects adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, a measure of profit, of between $120 million and $140 million.\n\nThe company also reported a surprise operating loss of $188.4 million for 2025.\n\nLyft saw an \"unexpected\" increase in competitors' price promotions that weighed on its quarterly results, CEO David Risher said on an earnings call.\n\n\"During a season of heightened competitive promotions, we prioritized the most durable, profitable demand in the marketplace,\" the company said in commentary released with its results.\n\nThe results complicate Lyft's turnaround story. Since Risher became CEO in 2023, Lyft has cut costs and introduced new products for riders, including a price-lock feature for commuters. Lyft's stock is up about 11% over the past year.\n\nOn Tuesday's earnings call, Risher pointed to Lyft's growth plans for 2026 and beyond, including adding Black car rides and a service specifically for teens — both options that rival Uber already offers.\n\nRisher also pointed to robotaxis as an area of expansion. Lyft is working with Waymo to bring self-driving cars to its ride-hailing app in Nashville later this year.\n\nStill, the company faces challenges in the autonomous vehicle market. Asked by an analyst why Lyft hasn't struck deals with more robotaxi providers, Risher said: \"There just aren't that many suppliers\" that can function at the scale Lyft needs.\n\nRisher said he expects robotaxi availability to change over the next few years. \"We see a lot of supply coming online\" by 2030, he said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Moderate House Republicans worried about this year’s midterm elections appear ready to finally break with President Donald Trump over his signature economic policy.\n\nIn a bid to protect Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson has repeatedly introduced procedural rules banning members from bringing up resolutions challenging the president’s crushing tariffs on products from dozens of U.S. trading partners.\n\nOn Tuesday, Johnson planned to ask the House to extend the ban through August. But this time, key Republicans signaled they would likely vote against the measure, Punchbowl reported.\n\n“American consumers pay the tariffs and thus it is a big tax,” Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska told the outlet. “I support giving these authorities back to Congress.”\n\nRep. Kevin Kiley of California also told Punchbowl that he had “made it clear” he was not in favor of extending the blockade.\n\nWith full attendance, two Republican defectors would be enough to sink Johnson’s proposed extension, opening the door to a flood of Democratic resolutions challenging the increasingly unpopular tariffs.\n\nThe vote is likely to be close, as some Republicans are still holding out hope the Supreme Court will strike down the tariffs, easing voters’ concerns while sparing them a confrontation with the president, according to Punchbowl.\n\nThe duties are a form of import tax paid by American companies, which must either eat the additional costs or pass them along to consumers.\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed the bulk of the costs fall on foreign producers and middlemen, when in fact Americans “pay one way or the other—via higher prices or less choice,” the opinion editors of the Rupert Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal wrote last week.\n\nTrump trade adviser Peter Navarro acknowledged in December that U.S. manufacturing was down thanks to the tariffs, which have also contributed to higher prices and led to intense trade volatility.\n\nTariffs were also at the center of an international scandal last month after the president threatened to impose duties on products from countries that opposed his efforts to seize Greenland, an autonomous region of a fellow NATO country, Denmark.\n\nHe ultimately dropped the threat after NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte talked him down during a meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nIf Johnson’s procedural vote fails, Democrats are likely to force votes as early as this week on resolutions to overturn Trump’s tariffs on products from Mexico and Canada, followed by resolutions aimed at tariffs on Brazilian products and products from other global trade partners.\n\nThe Canada vote in particular would be a difficult one for Republicans and would require the White House’s intervention, Johnson told Puck.\n\nWhile Trump could ultimately veto any resolution reining in his trade wars, a rebuke from Congress would nevertheless be politically damaging.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "description": "Dorothy...",
    "fullText": "In a new memoir, author Dorothy Roberts explores why interracial attraction can’t be disentangled from the larger forces of race, gender, and power that govern our world.\n\nI grew up in Chicago believing the book on interracial marriage my father, a white anthropologist, worked on throughout my childhood sprang from his love for my Black Jamaican mother. But when I finally opened the boxes of papers I had inherited, I discovered he had begun interviewing Black-white couples as a 21-year-old graduate student in the 1930s, long before he met her. In notes from his bachelor-era interviews in the 1950s, he described a wild party for mixed-race couples only. Reading these papers left me uneasy about desire that’s racialized—when race itself becomes the attraction.\n\nI can picture clearly the first time I was unsettled by this type of attraction. The moment plays back like a haunting scene from a movie.\n\nIt is the month before my eighth-grade graduation from my integrated school in Kenwood, as the chilly Chicago spring slowly warms into summer. I am barely thirteen years old. During recess or when school lets out, I notice two white girls in my grade leaning casually against the school wall as Black boys bend toward each one, playfully chatting.\n\nThe girls pose with an unaccustomed demeanor as they look up at the boys, seeming to hold their attention effortlessly. They are dressed in miniskirts that had become shorter than the year before, knee-high socks, and fitted blouses. I can tell they fancy themselves more mature than our classmates for talking with the boys in this manner. In hindsight, I suspect that the boys were students at the high school, who crossed the park separating our schools for a chance to share this momentary exchange.\n\nThat was my first awareness of the dynamic of white girls and Black boys expressing a distinctive attraction toward each other. The sight of those boys and girls interacting was unlike anything I had seen or experienced before. It felt unfamiliar, a sharp contrast to the behavior I was used to from my classmates.\n\nIn my little autograph book, with a blue cover and multicolored pages, where my classmates wrote playful farewells as we departed for high school, a common inscription from the girls was “2 cool 2 go 4 boys,” a phrase that hinted at a collective innocence—or perhaps a shared resistance to interest in romance. In that moment, I sensed that those white girls and Black boys had crossed a line. And I knew race played a part in what I was seeing.\n\nAt that point, the closest I’d gotten to flirting was a phone call from one of the Black boys in my class. He told me he liked me and asked me “to go with” him. Maybe if I had agreed, I might have been one of the girls with her back against the wall, with him smiling down at me that day. But even a second phone call was out of the question. My mother wouldn’t allow it.\n\nMaybe those white girls were the only ones who were willing, not the only ones who were desired. The Black southern writer Kiese Laymon explains in his memoir, Heavy, that the reason the first girl he had sex with was white—even though he was attracted to a Black girl—was because the white girl was the first to ask him. In any case, the dynamic surely would have been radically different if I, a Black girl, were in the scene.\n\nQuestions swirled in my mind. Did their flirting extend beyond the schoolyard? I wondered. Was there more to it than the playfulness I was witnessing? My mother had worked hard to shield me from any sexual experience of my own, but I could still detect the charged energy emanating from the scene. I felt a knot form in my stomach. My face burned with intense and confusing emotions I couldn’t fully articulate at the time. I resented the girls for the power they held over the boys. I felt disgusted with the boys for being captivated by it. I felt betrayed by all of them.\n\nI never felt similarly offended by my parents’ relationship, however. Daddy frequently praised my mother’s beauty while I was growing up. He admired my mother’s many dazzling traits, her intelligence and grace, along with her appearance, and he made a habit of saying so.\n\nLooking back on his attraction to her, I can see that it stemmed at least in part from her African features. As if to leave no doubt, Daddy was fond of repeating the saying “The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice.” I understood perfectly when I was little that he meant that he found Mommy’s dark skin—and the charms that went along with it—appealing. I also knew he meant the saying as a rebuke of the white-beauty standard, the dominant societal preference for light skin.\n\nFar from hearing anything unseemly in my father’s words, I was grateful for his adoration of my mother’s Blackness. At the time, I had no idea that he had pursued Black women long before he met my mother. Still, knowing that now doesn’t tarnish my view of their relationship. (Even if that means I am judging my classmates in my recurring memory more harshly than I am my parents.)\n\nStatistics bear out the strong influence race has on intimate relationships. The most obvious impact is that people in the United States tend to marry within their own race.\n\nThe US Supreme Court struck down bans on interracial marriage in 1967, but no law regulates personal preferences when choosing a partner. While interracial marriages have steadily increased in recent decades—along with popular approval—they remain relatively uncommon.\n\nAs my father noted in his 1940 master’s thesis, mixed-race marriages are far less frequent than we would expect if couples were randomly matched without regard to race. According to a 2008 study, if pairings were random, 44 percent of all US marriages would be interracial. In reality, that number is just about 20 percent—a clear sign that race continues to shape marital choices.\n\nFor me, interracial intimacy can’t be disentangled from the larger forces of race, gender, and power that continue to govern our world.\n\nBooks & the Arts\n\n /\n\n Benjamin Kunkel\n\nSoon after I opened my father’s boxes for the first time, I was introduced to the unsettling world of digital dating research by my sociology PhD student, Sarah Adeyinka-Skold. Her work explores how young women from different racial backgrounds navigate the search for long-term romantic partners. Based on dating app data and interviews with 111 Asian, Black, Latina, and white college-educated women, Sarah found that Black women face the greatest number of barriers in the modern dating landscape.\n\nMost online dating platforms allow users to set racial preferences, including filtering potential matches by race, and the patterns that emerge are striking. While most users, to varying degrees, show a preference to date within their own racial group, what’s more telling is who they won’t even consider.\n\nBlack users are 10 times more likely to message white users than the reverse. In fact, 80 percent of white users send messages exclusively to other white users, and only 3 percent reach out to Black users. One man, reflecting on these dynamics, described the trend as sexual racism masked as preference. He recalled sending a photo on a dating app and receiving a blunt reply: “I don’t like black guys, sorry.”\n\nConversely, whiteness—or even partial European ancestry—provides a noticeable advantage in the dating market. While white people are the least likely to date outside their racial group, non-white people are most likely to choose white people as the group they would date interracially.\n\nOne finding from the dating app data that Sarah shared with me was especially infuriating: Black women are the only group of women frequently excluded as potential dating partners by men of their own race. To put it bluntly, some Black men reject Black women categorically—simply because they are Black.\n\nThe history of sexual violation of Black women and lynching of Black men casts a long shadow over the politics of interracial intimacy. It makes Black women’s relationships with white men seem as if the women are capitulating to a white supremacist and patriarchal hierarchy, while Black men’s relationships with white women are countering it. But I can also see the opposite. Those exceptional white men who love, admire, and commit to Black women are nothing like exploitative enslavers—and the Black women who love them in return aren’t victims of exploitation. By contrast, those Black men who see having romantic relationships with white women as a badge of liberation, a prize that no Black woman can offer, do nothing to oppose the racial hierarchy. In these admittedly skewed scenarios, the white men are contesting white supremacist disparagement of Black women, whereas the Black men are playing into it.\n\nI can’t deny my bias—both as a Black woman and as the daughter of a Black woman who married a white man, my father. Yet, what matters most to me is my fierce loyalty to Black women and my opposition to the stereotypes, policies, dating apps, jokes, social media, TV shows, and movies that demean us. Few things ignite my anger more than the notion that Black women are inherently less attractive, less capable, less nurturing, or less valuable. Everything I have written and worked toward as an adult has been dedicated to celebrating and uplifting Black women’s sexuality, childbearing, and motherhood.\n\nI wish I could believe that sexual attraction, desire, and love exist untouched by race. Romantic attraction is supposed to be a magical force, something beyond our control that transcends the influence of society. “Why can’t you just be happy for people who love each other?” my husband often insists when I bring up the sociological dimensions of interracial intimacy. “Why does everything have to be political?”\n\nI would never discuss these thoughts at the interracial weddings of friends and family—I respect those moments and their marital decisions as deeply personal. I try not to make this about individual choices. But I can’t ignore what I’ve spent years studying: the undeniable ways unequal structures shape our preferences, even the most intimate ones.",

    "description": "Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she opposes President Trump's SAVE Act, an election bill requiring proof of citizenship to vote nationwide, saying states run elections.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska on Tuesday became the first Republican senator to speak out against the SAVE Act, a sweeping election bill backed by President Donald Trump that would require proof of citizenship to vote nationwide.\n\nIn doing so, she reminded her colleagues that they roundly claimed to oppose new federal election laws as recently as Joe Biden’s presidency.\n\n“When Democrats attempted to advance sweeping election reform legislation in 2021, Republicans were unanimous in opposition because it would have federalized elections, something we have long opposed,” Murkowski said in a statement. “Now, I’m seeing proposals such as the SAVE Act and MEGA that would effectively do just that. Once again, I do not support these efforts.”\n\n“Not only does the U.S. Constitution clearly provide states the authority to regulate the ‘times, places, and manner’ of holding federal elections, but one-size-fits-all mandates from Washington, D.C., seldom work in places like Alaska,” she added.\n\nUnder current law, all U.S. voters must attest under oath that they are citizens, with criminal penalties for lying. Beyond that, states can set their own rules.\n\nThe SAVE Act would bar states from registering people to vote unless they provide documents or evidence proving U.S. citizenship. It would also require all Americans to present ID when they go to vote.\n\nThe legislation, introduced by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, has 48 GOP co-sponsors, and Trump has repeatedly called on Congress to pass it in recent days. Even if it gains a majority of the Senate, it is subject to the 60-vote threshold, and Democrats have vowed to block it.\n\nWhile Trump and other SAVE Act backers say it’s designed to protect election integrity, Murkowski said it would do the opposite.\n\n“Election Day is fast approaching. Imposing new federal requirements now, when states are deep into their preparations, would negatively impact election integrity by forcing election officials to scramble to adhere to new policies likely without the necessary resources,” she said. “Ensuring public trust in our elections is at the core of our democracy, but federal overreach is not how we achieve this.”\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, Democrats passed the For the People Act through the House, seeking to establish an aggressive set of federal rules to bolster voting rights and ban partisan gerrymandering. A majority of senators supported a slimmed-down version, called the Freedom to Vote Act, but it died because of a Republican-led filibuster.\n\nAt the time, Senate Republicans vehemently opposed the measure, saying election rules must be left to states.\n\n“This is not a federal issue,” McConnell told reporters in January 2022 when the bill came before the Senate. “It ought to be left to the states. There’s nothing broken around the country. The system upheld very well during an intense stress during the latter part of the previous Congress. There’s no rational basis for federalizing this election, and, therefore, there’s no point in having a debate in the U.S. Senate about something we ought not do.”\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "description": "Lutnick admitted to visiting the late pedophile’s private island in sworn testimony earlier Tuesday before the Senate Commerce Committee",
    "fullText": "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday abruptly cut short a briefing with reporters after a reporter asked about Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe question came hours after Lutnick, responding to questions from congressional lawmakers over documents released by the Justice Department, revealed that he misled the public about the extent of his ties to the convicted pedophile sex trafficker, who killed himself in jail while awaiting trial.\n\nLeavitt was roughly 20 minutes into one of her regular briefings with the White House press corps when a reporter asked whether President Donald Trump would stand behind Lutnick, who earlier in the day had admitted to members of the Senate Commerce Committee that he’d visited Epstein’s notorious private island, Little Saint James.\n\nShe replied that Trump “fully supports” Lutnick and described him as “a very important member of President Trump's team.”\n\nBut instead of allowing reporters to probe further into Trump’s views on Lutnick, or ask any other further questions, Leavitt launched into a monologue chastising reporters for not asking about various positive statistics touted by the administration on issues of importance to the president.\n\n“I will just point out that there are a lot of wins in the news this week that people in this room have not asked about — you continue to ask questions about the same subject — so let me point them out for you again,” she said.\n\nLeavitt then started rattling off a list of days-old topics, including stock market results from this past Friday, a medical group announcing opposition to performing gender transition surgery on minors, or recent reductions in the national crime rate.\n\n“So we're going to get back to business. The president is very busy tonight, and you'll see him all tomorrow at the event in the East Room touting his administration’s energy policy,” she said.\n\nShe then turned and walked out of the room with a group of aides in tow.\n\nLeavitt also answered a question about another document released by the administration which relayed a secondhand report alleging that Trump had spoken to a Palm Beach, Florida police chief about Epstein and claimed that “everyone” knew about the pedophile’s illegal activities with minors.\n\nAlthough she would not confirm whether the alleged 2006 phone call actually happened, she claimed Trump has always been “honest and transparent” about his relationship with Epstein, who was once among one of his closest friends before the two men had a falling-out in the early 2000s.\n\nLutnick, a longtime friend of the president who had pushed to become Treasury Secretary after serving as the finance chief for Trump’s 2024 campaign, has not been similarly “honest and transparent” about his ties to the dead rapist.\n\nWhile he had told the New York Post in October that he’d cut off contact with Epstein — his onetime next door neighbor — after a 2005 encounter that he claimed had left him so unsettled that he’d vowed to “never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again,” documents released by the Justice Department showed that Lutnick not only maintained ties with Epstein as late as 2018 — the year before he was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges and long after he’d spent time in jail for state-level offenses related to his preying on young girls — but even arranged a visit to Epstein’s so-called “rape island” in 2012.\n\nThe commerce secretary admitted to visiting the infamous landmass, which is part of the U.S. Virgin Islands, on Tuesday under questioning from Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen.\n\n“I did have lunch with him, as I was on a boat going across on a family vacation. My wife was with me, as were my four children and nannies,” he said.\n\n“We had lunch on the island, that is true, for an hour, and we left with all of my children with my nannies and my wife … I don’t recall why we did it.”\n\nLutnick also claimed in his testimony that he “did not have any relationship with” Epstein and “barely had anything to do with that person.”",

    "description": "California's 91 Freeway uses AI cameras to catch solo HOV lane drivers, recovering $1 million in unpaid tolls through interior car photography.",
    "fullText": "Twenty-five thousand people monthly thought they were gaming the system on the 91 Express Lanes. Turns out, the house always wins — especially when it’s equipped with computer vision that can photograph your car’s interior through tinted windows. Since August 2025, Riverside County’s new Occupancy Detection System has been quietly documenting every solo driver pretending their gym bag is a passenger, recovering over $1 million in unpaid tolls and fees.\n\nThe technology reads like something from a dystopian Netflix series, except it’s scanning your morning commute. Cameras positioned at the end of the expressway capture multiple photographs of vehicle interiors. AI software flags potential violations before human reviewers at the Riverside County Transportation Commission confirm whether you actually have three people aboard. Get caught? You’ll pay the full toll plus a $5 “correction fee” — their polite term for getting busted.\n\nThis isn’t your typical red-light camera — the system spots fake passengers with unsettling accuracy.\n\nRCTC spokesperson Ariel Alcon reports catching drivers using “hats on headrests, putting items in baby car seats and even using mannequins” to fool the old enforcement system. The ODS isn’t impressed by your creativity. The technology distinguishes between actual humans and decoy passengers, even identifying properly installed car seats as legitimate occupants.\n\nConsider the scale: 400,000 cars use the 91 daily, with more than 100,000 breaking HOV rules. That’s roughly one in four drivers thinking they’re smarter than the system. Spoiler alert: they’re not.\n\nOfficials promise face-blurring and privacy compliance, but your driving habits are now permanent data.\n\nThe system protects privacy by blurring faces and storing images according to state and federal privacy laws. If you dispute a violation, you can call customer service at (800) 600-9191 or file online appeals through your 91 Express Lanes account. According to RCTC staff, most people don’t bother challenging charges once they learn about the cameras. That quiet acceptance speaks volumes about our collective resignation to surveillance infrastructure.\n\nThe 91’s success virtually guarantees expansion to other California carpool lanes. Your morning commute just became a case study in how automation transforms enforcement from occasional human oversight to constant digital monitoring.

    "title": "Here's How Long You Should Rest Between Workout Sets",
    "description": "30 seconds is not enough (usually).",
    "fullText": "A typical strength- or muscle-building workout happens in sets. You lift the weight a certain number of times (“reps”), then you put it down for a quick rest before going again. But how long should that rest be? The answer will depend on a few factors, including the purpose of the workout. And a lot of us aren't resting enough.\n\nLet's talk about the point of rest times. If you can keep moving for an entire workout without ever stopping to rest, you're probably not doing very effective strength training. Cardio can be continuous; most forms of strength training require that you work so hard you must rest.\n\nSo we do our strength exercises in \"sets\" of some number of \"reps.\" You do 10 reps of shoulder press, and then put the weight down for a minute or so. By resting appropriately, you give your muscles time to recover so they can do another set. The longer the rest, the heavier the weight you can usually handle in the next set.\n\nBut there are pros and cons to long and short rest times. The longer you rest between sets, the more recovered you'll feel. But the shorter your rests, the more work you'll be able to do in a given gym session. Choosing the most appropriate rest time for each exercise will get you the best gains in the gym. But the optimal rest time will depend on what kind of exercise you're doing and what your goals are. So let's go over some pros and cons of long and short rest times.\n\nLonger rests (say, three minutes or more) are best for strength workouts where the goal is to improve both your strength and your skill at lifting heavy weights. After all, you need practice at lifting heavy if you want to be able to lift heavy. After you put a heavy barbell down, you'll need several minutes for your body to be ready to do another big lift. Long rest times are best for:\n\nCompound exercises (those that use many muscles) like squats, deadlifts, snatches, and power cleans.\n\nHeavier weights. If you're working with barbells or doing fewer than 8 reps, you probably want a nice long rest.\n\nAmbitious strength goals. If you have a goal in mind—someday bench 225, for example—the kind of training that will get you there will require heavy weights and long rests.\n\nIn the three to five minutes you might rest between sets of (say) barbell squats, the ATP in your muscles regenerates. You get some blood flow to bring oxygen and nutrients into your muscle cells, and flush away metabolic byproducts. Resting for several minutes gives you the best chance of coming back to the next set at full strength.\n\nThe longer you rest—within reason—the more fully recovered you’ll be for the next set. If you only allow yourself one minute, you’ll still be fatigued when you pick up the weight again. But if you wait longer, you’ll be able to handle more weight.\n\nThe main disadvantage of long rest times is time management. Your workouts will be longer if you rest five minutes between exercises instead of one or two. You may also find yourself getting distracted between sets. You scroll social media for a bit, and somehow it's been eight minutes since you last touched a weight. Setting a timer can help with this.\n\nSome people get antsy during long rests, and will pass the time by doing pushups or jumping jacks. That kind of defeats the purpose of long rests. Save the supersets for your accessory work afterwards, not the main lift where you're trying to go heavy.\n\nFor an exercise where you're using large muscle groups (like a squat or deadlift), five minutes is typical once you're up to your heaviest working weights for the day. Warmup sets don't need as much time.\n\nFor exercises where you're working on strength but it's a lighter lift or uses smaller muscles (like overhead press), two to three minutes is usually plenty.\n\nWhen it comes to muscle growth, also called hypertrophy, shorter rests can make more sense. To be clear, strength and muscle growth are related, but not the same thing. If you aren't interested in lifting the heaviest weight possible, just in making your muscles bigger or your body more \"toned,\" you would want to pay attention to the best rest times for hypertrophy. These will be shorter than for pure strength. Use short rests for:\n\nIsolation exercises (those that only target one muscle group at a time).\n\nLighter weights. \"Accessory\" exercises with small weights don't need as much rest time.\n\nTraining for muscle size when strength is less important. If you don't care how much weight you're lifting, and you just want to move a weight and be done with your workout, short rests can help keep the workout moving while still giving your muscles something to do.\n\nTraditionally, trainers say that 90 seconds or less is a good rule of thumb. (The National Academy of Sports Medicine recommends 0 to 60 seconds; the personal training textbooks from the National Strength and Conditioning Association and the American Council on Exercise both recommend 30 to 90 seconds.)\n\nBut research has shown that short rest periods may not actually be better for muscle growth than longer ones. A 2016 study found that three-minute rest periods actually yielded more muscle growth than one-minute rests. The authors think this is because the men in their three-minute group (yep, the study was only done on men) were able to use heavier weights than the men in the one-minute group. Since the number of sets was the same in both groups, this means the three-minute group lifted more weight.\n\nA more recent meta-analysis also comes down on the side of longer rests. According to the studies they included in the analysis, the authors found that 30 to 60 seconds is likely too short. Resting one to two minutes between sets is best for muscle growth, they say. But according to this, more than two minutes doesn't really help, and may slow down your workout enough that you get fewer sets in.\n\nThe shorter your rests, the lighter weights you'll work with. This is fine if you're trying to make do with light dumbbells, but it means you're not getting practice with heavier weights. Most of us want to be jacked and strong, so short rest times mean you're biasing yourself to the muscle size side of the equation.\n\nVery short rest times (less than a minute) may also interfere with your ability to make the biggest gains, as the studies above noted. You may be able to make up for this by doing more sets of the exercise. If you enjoy the go-go-go feeling of short rests, that may be totally fine with you. Add an extra set or two and you know you're using your time well. For the rest of us, though, slowing down and taking a full minute between sets will be better than rushing it.\n\nOne to two minutes is likely the sweet spot, according to recent studies. That's on the higher end of the recommended 30 to 90 seconds. It's fine to do some of your rests shorter and some longer, but if you'd like me to tell you what to punch in on your timer, go with 90 seconds.\n\nUltimately, you may be best off using a mix of long and short rest times, which is how a lot of strength training programs are designed. Use longer rest times for a few big compound lifts at the beginning of the workout (like squats or bench press) and shorter rest times for circuits, accessories, or isolation exercises afterward (like curls or glute bridges).\n\nSupersets are a great way to split the difference. If you work different muscle groups in two different exercises, you can do one exercise while the other muscles rest. This isn't your best option if you truly want all your energy and focus to go toward one lift (like if you're working up to a PR on your bench press) but it's a great way to do hypertrophy work. For example, try this:\n\nIn this example, if it takes you 30 seconds to do the set of pushups, you've rested 90 total seconds in between your first set of pullups and your second set of pullups.\n\nOkay, but what if you want to get stronger and grow muscle? What if you want to stop overthinking the specifics and do whatever rest period makes you look like a normal person at the gym who knows what they’re doing? Here’s a cheat sheet:\n\nFor pushups and pull-ups: If you do a small to medium number of reps (less than 12), treat them as a strength exercise and wait three to five minutes between sets. If you’re one of those people banging out 20 or 50 at a time, you probably want to take rests of about a minute so that fatigue can make your next set a bit shorter and you can finish your workout in this lifetime.\n\nFor barbell squats and deadlifts: These are compound lifts that use many muscles in your body. They’re pretty much always done (relatively) heavy, and it’s useful to build strength in these moves. Treat them as a strength exercise and wait three to five minutes.\n\nFor bench press, overhead press, chest press, and shoulder press: These involve smaller muscles and less weight than squats and deadlifts, but they still qualify as compound, strength-focused exercises. Two to three minutes will be enough, most of the time, but take up to five on heavy sets if you need to.\n\nFor rows and lat pulldowns: Same as the presses, for the same reasons. Two to three minutes may be enough, but up to five would still be reasonable.\n\nFor isolation exercises: if you’re trying to feel the burn or the pump, short rests will really help you here. Take 30 seconds between sets.\n\nThese are just guidelines, so feel free to experiment. If you want to work on your cardiovascular conditioning, take a little less rest between sets. If you’ve already done a big set of bench presses today, do the rest of your arm and chest accessories with shorter rest periods.\n\nLet's do a lightning round, since I know rest times are a huge subject of discussion among people who are getting the hang of the gym routine. But first, a plea for you to not overthink this: if you simply rest until you feel ready to go again, you'll probably do ok.\n\nNo. If you're trying to move a heavy weight, you probably want to rest a minimum of three minutes. If you're training for muscle size (and don't care as much about strength), you could shorten your rests a bit. Still, it's not bad to rest too long, just slightly inefficient.\n\nAt that point I wouldn't call it a rest time, just a different workout. When you come back to the gym after that hour, you'll need to warm up all over again. I would say if it's been more than 10 or 15 minutes between sets, or if you feel like you're physically cooling down, it's worth doing some kind of exercise just to keep your body ready. This could be pushups while you're waiting for a bench to free up, for example.\n\nAs a noob, you're probably not lifting very heavy (yet). That means you don't have a lot to rest from. Say you're doing squats: your body is still learning how to squat at all. You aren't taking 300 pounds for a ride and needing to rest several minutes to recover.\n\nFor that reason, newer people may not need to rest as much. Two minutes between squat sets? Sure, that's fine if you feel ready. The pitfall here is that if you get used to taking short rests, you could end up working with weights that are too light for you. After your first few weeks at the gym, make sure to do some of your heavier lifts with longer rest times (at least three minutes) and see if you feel fresher.\n\nIf you can do multiple sets of an exercise without resting in between, you're not using an appropriate weight. There's supposed to be a difference between three sets of 10, and one set of 30. If your workout says to do 3x10, you're supposed to feel tired enough after that 10th rep that you need to rest at least a minute or two before going again.\n\nAnd yes, it can be awkward to be standing around in the squat rack, doing nothing or even scrolling on your phone while others are waiting. But remember: Everybody rests between sets! Or at least, they should.",

    "title": "What to Do If (or When) Your Email Is Leaked to the Dark Web",
    "description": "Don't panic: This really happens to the best of us.",
    "fullText": "The dark web has a bad reputation—one it has earned, at that. It's a complex subsection of the web, and it's not all bad by any means, but its nature does allow illicit and illegal activity to prosper anonymously. That's why hackers choose the dark web as their point of sale for stolen user data: If you're going to traffic digital contraband, you're going to do so as privately as possible.\n\nAs such, you might be a bit stressed if you're told your email address was found on the dark web. Maybe you use an identity theft service, which discovered your information here. Perhaps you're noticing an uptick in spam, especially spam that seems targeted to you personally. In any case, it's understandable to be anxious. The good news is, this is more common than you think, and there are steps you can take to protect your data going forward.\n\nDespite its aforementioned reputation, the dark web is not \"Evil Doers Central.\" It's simply one part of the deep web, or the part of the internet not indexed by search engines. The deep web makes up the vast majority of the global internet, but the dark web is unique, because it requires a specific type of browser, like Tor, and knowledge of specific dark web addresses, to access.\n\nThe dark web is inherently private, and inherently anonymous. That's why it attracts bad actors. But that doesn't mean that's all it's good for. Anyone who needs to access the internet without worrying about intervention can use the dark web. Think about journalists in countries that would rather they not tell their stories, or citizens whose governments censor the public internet. There's plenty of bad to be had, to be sure, but there's also perfectly innocent and productive content, too. \n\nIf your email address is on the dark web, it's likely because one of the companies you shared it with suffered a data breach. Unfortunately, data breaches happen all the time, and there's really no way to ensure that a company you choose to share your email address with won't be a victim of a breach at some point in the future. Sometimes the company itself is breached; other times, it's a third-party the company shares data to.\n\nWhen bad actors break into an organization's systems and steal their data, they often put the spoils on the dark web. This makes it easier to sell the stolen data anonymously. As such, it's really no surprise if your email ends up on the dark web—though that might not be much consolation.\n\nYour email address is for sale, and someone buys it. Now what? Well, such a hacker could choose a few tactics here. First, they'll likely want to try breaking into different accounts you might have used that email address with. If you lost any passwords in the data breach, they might try those, too. That's why it's an excellent idea to change your passwords as soon as you learn about the breach—but more on that later.\n\nIf they can't break into your accounts on their own, they'll want to enlist your services—unknowingly, of course. To do so, they'll likely target you in phishing attacks, and, seeing as they know your email address, they'll probably come via email. There are a lot of phishing campaigns out there, but here are some examples: You might receive fake data breach notices, with a link to check your account; you might find a message telling you it's time to change your password; you might get an email warning you about a login attempt; you might even receive an aggressive email, with demands from the hackers.\n\nHackers may also choose to impersonate you. They might create an email that looks very similar to yours, and reach out to your contacts in order to trick them into thinking it's really you. Tell your close contacts (especially any you think won't look close at the \"from\" line in an email) that your email was leaked on the dark web, and to watch out for imposters.\n\nFirst of all, don't panic. Again, data breaches happen so often that many of our email addresses (among other data) have leaked onto the dark web. While this isn't a good thing, it also isn't the end of the world.\n\nNext, change your passwords, starting with your email account itself. If you know the account the email was stolen from, make sure to change this next, as your password may have also be affected in the data breach. As usual, make each password strong and unique: You should never reuse passwords with any account, and all of them should be long and difficult for both humans and computers to guess. As long as each of your accounts uses a strong and unique password, you really shouldn't have to change all of your passwords: Hackers may have your email, but they won't have all these passwords to use with it.\n\nFrom here, make sure all of your accounts use two-factor authentication (2FA), when available. 2FA ensures that even if you have the email address and password for a given account, you still need access to a trusted device to verify your identity. Hackers won't be able to do anything with your stolen credentials if they don't have physical access to, say, your smartphone. This is a crucial step for maintaining your security following a data breach. You could also choose to use passkeys instead of passwords for any accounts that offers it. Passkeys combine the convenience of passwords with the security of 2FA: You log in with your fingerprint, face scan, or PIN, and there's no password to actually steal.\n\nFrom here, monitor your various accounts connected to this email, especially your financial accounts. Your email address alone likely won't put you in too much jeopardy, but if you lost additional information, you'll want to ensure hackers don't breach your important accounts. You could take drastic steps, like freezing your credit, but, again, if it's just your email address, this is likely a step too far.\n\nWhile some data removal services claim to be able to remove data like email addresses from the dark web, it's just not 100% possible. The dark web is vast and unregulated, and once the data leaks onto it, the cat's kind of out of the bag. Sure, a service like DeleteMe could request data web hosts to take down your email, but they don't have to. Plus, hackers who buy your email already have it. Again, exposed email addresses are not the end of the world. But if you can't stand having your email on the dark web, your best bet may be to make a new account.\n\nWhat you can do is take measures to prevent data loss in the future. The best step to take is to stop sharing your email in the first place. You don't need to be a hermit, though: Use an email alias service, like Apple's Hide My Email or Proton's email alias feature, to generate a new alias every time you need to share your email. Messages sent to the alias are forwarded to your inbox, so the experience is the same for you, all without exposing your actual address to the world. If one of these companies suffers a data breach, no problem: Just retire the alias.\n\nTo that point, going forward, consider using a data monitoring and removal service. Maybe you already do, and that's how you learned about your email on the dark web to begin with. But if you don't, there are many options out there to choose from. While none can promise they'll remove email addresses from the dark web, they might spot your email if it ends up there. If you use aliases, you can then kill that particular address and make a new one for the affected account. Plus, if your email ends up somewhere other than the dark web, they might be able to remove it for you.",

    "title": "WhatsApp's Web App Is Getting a Huge Upgrade",
    "description": "You'll need to enroll in the beta to try it early.",
    "fullText": "While there are a lot of chat apps out there, WhatsApp is the undeniable leader of the pack. The app has over three billion monthly active users, constantly messaging and calling one another across the globe. However, currently those calls are all happening over the mobile app, or maybe the desktop app. Though WhatsApp does have a web app, the service has never supported audio or video calls outside of its downloadable apps—until now.\n\nAccording to WABetaInfo, WhatsApp is slowly rolling out audio and video calls to its web app. At launch, the functionality is coming to individual chats with users who elect to enroll in the WhatsApp web app's beta, but the company plans to roll out the feature to all web app users over the coming weeks.\n\nWABetaInfo notes that voice and audio calls work about the same as they do in the WhatsApp desktop app. When you open an individual chat in the web app, you'll now see a video call icon at the top. Click this, and you'll find two options: one to place a voice call, and one to place a video call. These calls are still end-to-end encrypted, as they are on WhatsApp's desktop and mobile apps, meaning only the users who are a part of the calls can hear what's being said. In addition, the web app's video call client supports Screen Share, so you can share a live stream of your computer's screen to another WhatsApp contact.\n\nWhatsApp is also reportedly working on group chat calls for web app users, as well. While that feature won't roll out alongside individual calls, when it does launch, you'll be able to join group chats with up to 32 people.\n\nIf you tend to use the WhatsApp desktop or mobile apps, this might not seem like huge news—but it is pretty substantial for a few subsets of WhatsApp users. One, of course, is the user base that just prefers using WhatsApp in their computer's web browser—but the other is Linux users. WhatsApp doesn't actually offer a version of its desktop app for Linux, so those users have to use the web app if they want to run WhatsApp on their computers. That means they've never before been able to place calls without pulling out a mobile device.\n\nThis feature will soon roll out to all web app users, but until then, you need to be running the WhatsApp web app beta in order to try it.\n\nLuckily, it's pretty easy to get up and running. To start, open the web app, then head to the settings menu, choose \"Help,\" then choose the \"Join beta\" option. This will immediately switch you over to the beta version of the web app. (You should see a \"Beta\" label on your screen.) Now that you're running the beta, should you find the option to place calls in individual chats.",

    "description": "Does Heart of Midlothian's late derby winner against Hibernian suggest they are developing the habit of champions as they go six points clear at the top of the Scottish Premiership?",
    "fullText": "Heart of Midlothian v Hibernian highlights\n\nAnother late derby win for Heart of Midlothian, another late goal that sparked jubilation around the stands at Tynecastle, another Derek McInnes celebration with a ballboy.\n\nTomas Magnusson's 88th-minute strike in Tuesday's Edinburgh derby at home to Hibernian added yet more veracity to a title charge that few would have found believable at the start of the season.\n\nIt is not the first time this campaign when they have produced a moment of magic in the last few minutes, or even dying seconds, to fuel the fires of belief among their fans.\n\nIt is the habit of champions. The ability to rescue victory from the jaws of defeat, to conjure three points from the ashes.\n\nCeltic and Rangers have done it plenty over the years - the former did it again in the Scottish Cup at the weekend - and now Hearts are showing they can do it too.\n\nBoy did they need it after last week's defeat away to St Mirren and with both sides of the Old Firm improving since changing their managers.\n\nDefeat by Hibs would have given Rangers the chance to go top when they visit Motherwell on Tuesday.\n\nInstead, with just 12 games to go, McInnes' side, who have been out in front since September, are six points clear of Danny Rohl's Ibrox side as they face a difficult away trip to the side sitting fourth.\n\nReigning champions Celtic are a further three points back, albeit with an extra game in hand.\n\nListen: Reaction as Hearts edge Hibs with late derby winner\n\nMotherwell v Rangers, O'Neill & Nygren in focus\n\nHearts extend Premiership lead with late derby winner against Hibs\n\nYou only need to look at the second round of fixtures in this campaign to find the first example of Hearts digging deep and finding a late winner.\n\nIt came at Tannadice, where Stuart Findlay popped up late to overturn a 2-1 deficit against Dundee United and give McInnes' side all three points.\n\nThey did it again at the end of August, against Livingston, when Alexandros Kyziridis scored at Almondvale to secure a 2-1 win.\n\nThen there was Craig Halkett's goal in the first derby of the season, a 91st-minute strike as he slid in to connect with a Sabah Kerjota cross.\n\nIt is not just goals, either. Look at Craig Gordon's save, away to Dundee, with the team down to 10 men after fellow goalkeeper Alexander Schwolow's red card.\n\nHolding on at 1-0, the veteran Scotland international somehow kept Emile Acquah's header from ripping away two precious points.\n\nTo put a statistic to it, Hearts have scored 12 goals in the last 15 minutes of league matches this season. Only one side have scored more - Rangers.\n\n\"What we've got in abundance is a desire to make the game go our way,\" head coach McInnes said. \"Harry Milne's desire to get the ball to the byeline, Tomas Magnusson's desire to get on the end of it. That's what I'm talking about.\n\n\"I always feel we've got a goal in us. It's very rarely we don't score. What a brilliant moment for us. Tynecastle was such a beautiful sight.\"\n\nThe late goals are not the only habit that Hearts are forming. Winning the hard way, getting maximum points from a bare minimum performance, is something that title-winning teams do too.\n\n\"If you want to challenge for titles and win leagues, you have to win ugly, and Hearts did that tonight,\" former Celtic defender Charlie Mulgrew told Premier Sports.\n\nHe was not the only pundit to comment on Hearts' below-par performance. While McInnes named an attacking side, they looked timid in the build up, struggling to stay calm in the typical chaos of an Edinburgh derby.\n\n\"They'll not really care about the performance, they've got 12 games to create history,\" former Hearts midfielder Ryan Stevenson, who also had a hard job picking a man of the match, told BBC Sportsound.\n\n\"Harry Milne, for me, he tried everything he possible could to affect the game, to drive Hearts forward. Other than him, pretty much all of them were stinking.\"\n\nWell, quite. Scott Allan, the former Hibs and Celtic midfielder, was a bit more eloquent in his assessment.\n\n\"Tonight was such a big game and to not play well at all... I couldn't see Hearts scoring a goal, I thought there was only going to be one winner and it was Hibs,\" he reflected.\n\n\"To win like that, clean sheet as well, it says so much about what you're building in there.\n\n\"Derek McInnes will not be worried about that performance. What a position that puts Hearts into, going into that game on Sunday.\"\n\nAh yes, the game on Sunday. Rangers at Ibrox. Hearts won there back in September, their first victory away to the blue half of Glasgow since 2014.\n\nNo-one could have imagined then that, the next time Hearts came to town, the visitors would still have a lead over their hosts in the standings.\n\n\"If they get three points at Ibrox, I think they'll win the league,\" Stevenson predicted. A big call for a big game.\n\nVisit our Hearts page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Hearts news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "fullText": "Swansea City co-owner Snoop Dogg will attend one of the Championship club's games for the first time when they face Preston North End on Tuesday, 24 February (19:45 GMT).\n\nThe American rapper became an investor at Swansea last July and said last month that he wants to help the Welsh side become a \"global name\".\n\nSnoop Dogg will now make his long-awaited first appearance at a Swansea fixture when Vitor Matos' team host Preston.\n\n\"From the moment we talked about me becoming an owner, I have been looking forward to the chance to be with you all at the Swansea.com Stadium,\" Snoop Dogg told the club's website.\n\n\"I have heard so many great things about the atmosphere, especially when we play under the lights.\n\n\"When I watched the Wrexham game [on television in December], where we showed we are the capital of Welsh football, the noise in the stadium sounded incredible even from over 5,000 miles away. I can't wait to be a part of it.\"\n\nSwansea say Snoop Dogg will appear pitchside prior to the Preston game £to lead supporters in a pre-match fan display\".\n\n\"In addition to watching the Swans in action, the 21-time Grammy nominee and four-time Emmy award winner will also take the opportunity to visit areas of our local community to meet supporters and experience life in our city and region,\" the club added.\n\nSnoop Dogg, 54, is in Europe for the Winter Olympics that finish on 22 February.\n\nHe is with Team USA at the Games, which are taking place in Italy, as a hype man and 'honorary coach'.\n\nSnoop Dogg had been expected to visit at some stage this season after he followed Real Madrid legend Luka Modric by becoming a co-owner of the club.\n\nThey have since been joined by a third celebrity investor, with billionaire American businesswoman Martha Stewart – who is a friend of Snoop Dogg – coming on board in December.\n\nLatest Swansea City news, analysis and fan views\n\nListen to the latest Swansea City interviews, news and discussion on BBC Sounds\n\nMatos plays down play-off talk despite Swans' form\n\n\"We want to take Swansea to the Premier League, and to do that we are going to need money - that's the reality of the game these days,\" Snoop Dogg said in January.\n\n\"I want to introduce sponsorship deals and publicity that will make them a global name.\"\n\nSnoop Dogg will follow his son, Cordell Broadus, who was in the directors' box for Swansea's draw with Watford last August.\n\nThe Swans' owners, led by American duo Brett Cravatt and Jason Cohen, believe bringing in high-profile names at boardroom level will help increase the club's profile and, in turn, boost income.",

    "fullText": "Glentoran manager Declan Devine says he is \"gutted\" after league leaders Larne netted a late equaliser against his side, who were shown two red cards, at Inver Park.\n\nPaul O'Neill's penalty on 21 minutes gave the home side the lead before two goals from Pat Hoban flipped the game on its head.\n\nHowever, goalscorer Hoban was then dismissed with Gary Haveron's side awarded another penalty deep into stoppage time and Andy Ryan able to convert the rebound of his effort.\n\n\"The game itself is an entertaining game. I thought we were very much in control of our own destiny,\" Devine told BBC Sport NI.\n\n\"The sending offs are ridiculous and if they are given then three or four players are sent off in every game.\n\n\"I don't think Larne caused us that many problems to be honest, a couple of half chances. I am just gutted for the players, the quality that they showed and that, again, we come here and every decision in the game goes against you.\"\n\nAs well as Hoban's dismissal, Cooney also picked up a straight red card after the final whistle following an altercation with referee Shane Andrews with Devine adding that decision was a \"farce\".\n\n\"The players deserve huge credit as they delivered everything we asked of them and, even when down to 10, we were very comfortable and to give the second penalty is inexcusable in the 95th minute,\" Devine continued.\n\n\"To send Ryan Cooney off after the game is a farce, an absolute farce.\n\n\"We are trying to make the league professional and a really high level. It is the players, managers and staff's livelihoods and for people to make decisions like they did tonight, I have no words.\"\n\nHowever, Larne manager Haveron disagreed with Devine and added that his side should have had another penalty when it appeared that Jarlath O'Rourke used his hand to block Ryan's effort.\n\n\"There was a bit of drama at the end. We weren't at our best, but I always say when you're not at your best then don't lose,\" Haveron said.\n\n\"It's a stonewall penalty. They can say whatever they want but his hand was high. The one with Jarlath O'Rourke is a shocking decision. It really was shocking and it could have cost us massively if we lost the game.\n\n\"That could make a difference in the run-in. It's really poor and there's no excuses for it, it was on the line. It needs to be looked at, in my opinion. He got one right, but the one with 10 or 15 minutes to go, he handled the ball on the line.\"",

    "description": "Mark Zuckerberg owns over 1,200 acres of land. Here's a look at the Facebook founder's US properties, from a Hawaii bunker to Lake Tahoe houses.",
    "fullText": "Mark Zuckerberg has been quietly snapping up massive chunks of real estate for years.\n\nThe tech billionaire has bought hundreds of acres of Hawaiian land.\n\nRecently, he also reportedly bought property in Miami.\n\nMark Zuckerberg is one of the world's richest people, and his multimillion-dollar real estate portfolio reflects that.\n\nThe man responsible for Facebook is worth an estimated $231 billion, Forbes reported, and part of that fortune includes assets like a sprawling California compound and acres of lush land on a Hawaiian island.\n\nZuckerberg's real estate dealings are often shrouded in privacy, including the use of limited-liability companies and addresses linked to the investment management firm Iconiq Capital.\n\nHis most recent real estate deal, as reported by The Wall Street Journal, is a mansion on Indian Creek, an exclusive South Florida island that's home to other tech titans like Jeff Bezos. Representatives for Zuckerberg at Meta declined to comment to Business Insider.\n\nOver the years, Zuckerberg has bought and sold homes all over the country. He's also reportedly built some — a Hawaiian doomsday ranch that has had many scratching their heads, for example.\n\nHere's what we know about his real estate portfolio.\n\nZuckerberg owns a residential compound in Palo Alto.\n\nIt's no surprise that a tech titan has more than one property in Silicon Valley. The Meta CEO owns five homes in the Crescent Park neighborhood of Palo Alto.\n\nHe gave viewers a rare peek inside one of them in 2016; the house is even tricked out with a \"custom-made artificially intelligent assistant,\" according to CNBC. The home is only a 10-minute drive from the Meta HQ in Menlo Park.\n\nHe bought the first Crescent Park property in May 2011 for $7 million.\n\nArchitectural Digest described it as a \"'no frills abode\" that chooses function over extravagance. Zuckerberg then spent over $43 million on the four homes surrounding his original residence in Crescent Park, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nHe sold his San Francisco townhouse in 2022 for a reported $31 million.\n\nThe four-bedroom, four-bathroom home is located near San Francisco's Dolores Park. He and his wife, Priscilla Chan, reportedly spent $10 million to purchase the townhouse in 2010.\n\nAt the time of the sale in 2022, it was the largest residential real estate deal in the city.\n\nHe bought two adjacent estates on the shore of Lake Tahoe around 2019.\n\nLake Tahoe is a popular vacation destination for wealthy Californians in both summer and winter, and Zuckerberg and his family are no exception.\n\nThe tax records of the two properties — known as Carousel Estate and Brushwood Estate — display the same address as tax records of other properties linked to Zuckerberg, according to documents viewed by BI.\n\nZuckerberg reportedly paid $59 million for both properties.\n\nAt 5,322 square feet, the Brushwood Estate features six bedrooms, five baths, and two half baths, according to SF Gate. Inside are high-beamed ceilings and picture windows; outside are lush trees, a private dock, and a hot tub. There's also a 2,293-square-foot guesthouse.\n\nThe Meta exec owns over 1,200 acres of land in Hawaii.\n\nIt's unclear exactly how many acres of land Zuckerberg currently owns on Kauai, but he began buying up a region of the island back in 2014.\n\nBusiness Insider tracked down at least 1,200 acres between 17 parcels of land that have the same tax address as other properties mentioned above, but are owned by LLCs including Kahu'aina Holdings LLC and Pila'a International LLC.\n\nThe 1,200 acres include about 750 acres he reportedly paid $100 million in 2014 for. That encompasses a more than 350-acre span of land on Pila'a Beach.\n\nHis plans for Koolau Ranch seem to be in preparation for the worst case scenario.\n\nAnother part of Zuckerberg's Hawaii holdings is the nearly 600 acres of land on Kauai's North Shore that reportedly cost him around $53 million in 2021.\n\nOn one of his Hawaiian parcels, Zuckerberg is reportedly building a huge compound that's said to include a 5,000-square-foot underground bunker with an escape hatch. It's been dubbed Koolau Ranch, and Wired reported that buying the land and creating the compound cost the executive an estimated $270 million.\n\nIn March 2025, he purchased a 15,000-square-foot mansion in Washington, DC.\n\nAs Silicon Valley continues to infiltrate Washington, DC, Zuckerberg established a residence in the US capital, Politico said. The home that's reportedly his new pad is situated in Massachusetts Avenue Heights, not far from the Naval Observatory and the Washington National Cathedral, according to Builder magazine.\n\nZuckerberg kept the purchase private, Politico said. The mansion in question was sold for $23 million in cash. It was designed by local firm Robert Gurney Architect and sits on about one acre of property.\n\nBusiness Insider was unable to independently confirm that Zuckerberg purchased the property.\n\nZuckerberg is also moving down the street from Jeff Bezos after reportedly buying property in Miami.\n\nMark Zuckerberg is reportedly adding a second East Coast property to his portfolio after buying a home in Miami, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nZuckerberg is purchasing a waterfront mansion on Indian Creek, an exclusive island in South Florida that's home to Jeff Bezos, Carl Icahn, and Jared Kushner.\n\nThe sold home previously belonged to a limited liability company linked to Peter Cancro, the founder of Jersey Mike's Subs. The property — which was just a home lot — was last traded for $37 million in 2021, Miami-Dade property records show.\n\nIt's unclear how much this off-market deal was worth, but an empty lot next door to Bezos sold for $105 million in 2025.\n\nHillary Hoffower contributed to an earlier version of this story.",

    "fullText": "From the astonishing to the emotional to the downright bizarre, the Olympic figure skating men's short program on Tuesday night had it all.\n\nBut the star once again was the USA's Ilia Malinin, who stormed to the top of the leaderboard with a stunning routine featuring a quad flip and quad lutz - two of the hardest techniques in the sport.\n\nAlthough he did not quite land the quad axel which has earned him the nickname 'Quad God', it put him top of the short program with a score of 108.16.\n\nAnd unlike in the team event, where he made errors and was somewhat style over substance, this was an ominously clean routine from the 21-year-old – and he even threw in a backflip for good measure.\n\nJapan's Yuma Kagiyama, generally regarded as Malinin's biggest competitor for first, is more than five points behind after slipping on his triple axel.\n\nKagiyama is second on 103.07, while France's Adam Siao Him Fa impressed with a score of 102.55. Daniel Grassl, the best hope for hosts Italy of another medal on the ice, sits fourth with 93.46.\n\nBut all eyes are on Malinin as he strives for individual Winter Olympic gold. He has not been beaten in competition for almost two and a half years.\n\nAnd after recording more than 200 points in the team event free skate – the second half of the men's event - which secured the USA team gold on Sunday, few would bet against him here.\n\nHe entered the rink ready for a fight, shadowboxing at the camera. And he brought the fight to his rivals.\n\nThe battle will be concluded on Friday evening in the free skate, where Malinin will be the 24th and last man to compete.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nIt is impossible to imagine what American skater Maxim Naumov has been through in the last 12 months.\n\nJust over a year ago, his parents - former world champion pairs skaters Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova - were among 67 people killed in a plane crash in Washington DC. Of those on board the flight, 28 were athletes, coaches or parents connected to US figure skating.\n\nNaumov said that his dream to make Team USA was one of the last things he spoke about with his parents before they were killed.\n\n\"They are my superheroes, my role models, and my biggest support system. I just wanted to make them proud here,\" he told the BBC after his performance.\n\n\"My dad said: 'Everything is practice until it is the Olympics'. I can't describe to you in words how much I just felt what he said. Also, there are truly no words for being able to step up to the occasion, I just wish that I made them proud.\"\n\nHe made it to the Games, and was second on the ice on Tuesday, dancing to Nocturne No. 20 by Frederic Chopin.\n\nAfter a slight slip on his triple axel, Naumov regained composure and skated a technically solid routine.\n\nAs he finished, the 24-year-old looked to the sky on his knees with tears in his eyes as the arena erupted. With a huge smile, cameras captured him saying \"thank you\" – perhaps to those both inside the arena, and in another place.\n\nAnd it was good enough for the judges, who awarded Naumov a season best of 85.65 points for the performance – enough for a spot in the top 24 and a place in the free skate on Friday.\n\nAs the scores came in, Naumov held up a picture of his late parents with him as a young child.\n\n\"I bring it everywhere that I go,\" he said of the image, which showed him holding hands with his parents while stood next to an ice rink. \"It is in my bag, so it is literally right here on my heart.\n\n\"They deserve to be here, to be right next to me, to look up at the scores together and say: 'Look at what we just did!'\"\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nOne of the most eye-catching stories in the build-up to the Games was that of Spanish figure skater Tomas-Llorenc Guarino Sabate.\n\nThroughout the 2025-26 season, Sabate has performed to songs from the Minions while wearing a yellow T-shirt and blue overalls, like the characters' outfits.\n\nHowever, at the Olympics it seemed as though Sabate, known for his flamboyant and unusual routines, would have to change his usual routine in the men's singles because of a copyright issue.\n\nAfter days of negotiations and online outcry, the issues were sorted and the Minion would skate.\n\nBut after all that, it went wrong almost immediately for Sabate as he tripped on his first element. The Universal fanfare, as done by Minions, had barely ended.\n\nUltimately there were too many technical errors, and a score of 69.80 was not enough to take him through as he finished in 25th place.\n\nBut Sabate, who has been keen to thank all those who took up his cause to allow his music at the Games, bowed with gusto to all four sides as one of Milan-Cortina's most memorable characters exited the stage.",

    "fullText": "It is hard to think of a more contrasting scene at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nOn a night Spurs manager Thomas Frank was subjected to humiliating chants of \"You're getting sacked in the morning\" from a section of his own supporters, opposite number Eddie Howe was repeatedly serenaded by a buoyant away end.\n\nHowe was even pushed in front of the travelling support by Bruno Guimaraes and Kieran Trippier to take the acclaim of the crowd after his side's 2-1 win.\n\nThe Newcastle head coach is not usually one for doing so.\n\nBut he could not help but punch the air before waving his arms up and down as Newcastle supporters roared in response.\n\n\"That was a special connection,\" he said. \"I'm grateful it's still there.\"\n\nThose words were uttered just a few days after Newcastle were booed off at St James' Park following a 3-2 defeat against Brentford.\n\nThat was an evening a crestfallen Howe admitted he was not doing his job \"well enough at the moment\".\n\nIt led to a lot of soul searching for Howe behind the scenes following just one win in eight games in all competitions.\n\n\"It was not an act,\" he said. \"That was me being very real and very genuine in terms of how I felt.\n\n\"I'll say it again. I've got to believe that I'm the right person to be in the job with all the sacrifices that it entails and I've got to feel that the players are playing for me.\n\n\"Today they showed that they are – but that has to be consistent moving forward.\"\n\nRamsey fires Newcastle to rare away win at Spurs\n\nThe sight of a number of Howe's players struggling with cramp in the closing stages certainly told you they were fighting for him.\n\nThey were maxed out on a night some familiar names and some more recent additions delivered for Newcastle.\n\nThe club's recruitment has rightly come under intense scrutiny - Newcastle have not seen much of an immediate return from a £250m summer spend - but three of Howe's signings stepped up on Wednesday.\n\nMalick Thiaw, the one undoubted early success, opened the scoring, the rapid Anthony Elanga put in his most impressive performance yet and Jacob Ramsey scored what proved to be the winner after netting his first goal for the club in the second half.\n\n\"I keep saying the lack of training is slowing their development,\" Howe said.\n\n\"But they are beginning to feel at home in the team and once you feel part of it, and feel integral to how the team plays, you can only get better.\"\n\nYet it was striking how Newcastle started the game without two headline additions.\n\nNick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa were left on the bench - just a few months after Howe spent £124m on the forwards.\n\nThat told its own story as the visitors lined up without a recognised striker for the second away league game in a row.\n\nAnthony Gordon was instead tasked with leading the line on the road again after Howe took heart from the opening half an hour of his side's 4-1 defeat against Liverpool.\n\nGordon put Newcastle in front at Anfield that night, but it was still a bold call.\n\nHowever, Gordon, Elanga and Harvey Barnes aggressively led the press out of possession as they hunted down Spurs' defenders and broke forward quickly with the ball.\n\nThere were still occasions where Newcastle were crying out for a poacher in the box to get on the end of a number of teasing crosses from Elanga.\n\nHowever, the speed of Newcastle's front line caused Spurs problems and Gordon's dancing feet set up Ramsey's winner.\n\nRemarkably, it was just travel-sick Newcastle's third away league victory of the season.\n\nNewcastle have too often been soft, throwing away more points (19) than any other side in the division.\n\nBut this was an evening where they \"really did inspire each other\" following a difficult few days.\n\n\"If anything they used it in a positive way and reinforced relationships,\" Howe added.\n\n\"It made us all look inward and look at what we're doing and how we can do it better.\"\n\nLatest Newcastle news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Newcastle - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Tottenham manager Thomas Frank insists his job is not under threat despite dropping to five points from the Premier League relegation zone - but will the Dane avoid the sack?",
    "fullText": "Thomas Frank insists his job is not under threat at Tottenham Hotspur, despite his side extending their winless run in the Premier League to eight matches.\n\nSpurs suffered their 11th defeat of the season with a 2-1 home loss to Newcastle on Tuesday night.\n\nIt leaves Tottenham, one of six ever-present Premier League clubs in the top flight, five points above the relegation zone.\n\nBut Frank says he has been assured his position as manager is safe.\n\nAsked by TNT Sports if his job is under threat, Frank said: \"I spoke to them [owners] yesterday, so no.\n\n\"I understand the frustration and the easiest thing is to point at me. That's part of the job unfortunately. I will work day and night to turn this around but it is not just one person. There is no doubt we need to improve and I need to be part of that.\"\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Live about supporters booing at full-time, Frank added: \"I understand the frustration. It has been building up a little bit - last season it was similar playing in Europe and the Premier League.\n\n\"We need to be resilient, mentally and physically. I am 100% sure that it is a team effort, and it is not only one person. We are all aligned and we know what needs to be done.\"\n\nHaving taken 10 points from 15 in their first five Premier League fixtures under Frank, Spurs have managed just 19 from their next 21 matches.\n\nTheir run of eight games without a win is their longest since going nine without victory in 2008 under Juande Ramos - who was sacked with the club bottom of the table.\n\n\"You've got to say what it is and they are in a relegation fight,\" Spurs legend Glenn Hoddle told TNT Sports.\n\n\"The players have to understand that and the fans have to understand that.\n\n\"It is the reality and you have to scrap for every single point.\"\n\nBoos rang around Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on the final whistle, while there were pockets of empty seats at kick-off.\n\n\"A lot of fans have lost faith in what Thomas Frank is doing here,\" added former Spurs striker Les Ferdinand.\n\n\"It is desperate times. And desperate times call for desperate measures.\"\n\nThe Tottenham hierarchy now have a huge decision to make.\n\nThomas Frank's future at the club is uncertain. That isn't a secret, of course - it has been the case for weeks.\n\nLarge sections of the supporters want him sacked. The boos that rang round Tottenham Hotspur Stadium at full-time were testament to that prevailing feeling from a disgruntled fanbase.\n\nCrucially, there has been a loss of support towards the Dane internally.\n\nSo, the fact Frank's disastrous first season in charge lurched to deeper depths following this defeat by Newcastle may have significant consequences.\n\nIf Nottingham Forest, who occupy 17th, beat Wolves on Wednesday night they will go level on points with Tottenham.\n\nFrank is understandably hesitant to admit his side are in relegation fight - but the numbers don't lie.\n\nThat said, it may not be Frank's problem for much longer - Tottenham's latest loss will push the beleaguered manager closer to what appears an inevitable exit.\n\nIndeed, such has been the level of contemplation regarding Frank's immediate future at Tottenham in recent weeks that this loss will almost certainly trigger further soul-searching from the club's leadership group.\n\nThe fact the Spurs board have stuck by Frank during such a difficult period proves they want the appointment to work.\n\nThe easier decision would have been to show Frank the door by now.\n\nHowever, the Tottenham hierarchy believe Frank has been dealt a rough hand.\n\nThere's an acknowledgment that the season has been disrupted by multiple injuries to key players.\n\nThere is also recognition that the squad needs repair work - particularly considering the departures of their two main sources of goals in Harry Kane and Son Heung-min.\n\nThere is also a sense behind the scenes that the squad is lacking in leadership. It was why they signed England international Conor Gallagher and tried to land Andy Robertson from Liverpool - both with plenty of Premier League experience.\n\nThere is also a sense from Tottenham's executive team that the club require a period of managerial stability.\n\nBut by the same token, sources have told BBC Sport that work towards a contingency plan in the event they make a decision they really don't want to make illustrates the precarity of Frank's position.\n\nIf the club decide to part with Frank in the immediate aftermath of this Newcastle defeat, they will have 12 days until their next fixture against Arsenal on 22 February.\n\nThat leaves Tottenham with a prolonged window to execute their replacement plan and leave Frank's successor with time to implement a blueprint for the north London derby.\n\nThe pressure on Frank is at breaking point. We are about to find out if Tottenham crack.\n\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Tottenham - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Michael Carrick is happy with his start as Manchester United head coach despite dropping his first points in 1-1 draw at West Ham.",
    "fullText": "The unintended consequence of exiting both domestic cup competitions at the earliest possible stage and ending up with the smallest season games-wise since 1914-15 is that the remainder of Manchester United's campaign is divided into blocks before a longer than usual spell without a game.\n\nThey are at the first now. It will be 12 days until United go to Everton.\n\nFor Michael Carrick, who was only appointed on 13 January, it is a good chance for his squad to \"refresh\", to allow some players to \"clean up their niggles and strains\" and \"take a bit of a breather\".\n\nBut it is also an opportunity to reflect.\n\nCarrick did not try and claim Benjamin Sesko's injury-time equaliser meant their 1-1 draw at West Ham felt like an extension of his four-match winning run, rather than the end of it, which it was.\n\nHowever, he did acknowledge the overall assessment of the last month has to be good.\n\n\"In the grand scheme of things, we take the point, dust ourselves down a little bit and assess it,\" he said.\n\n\"If you take it over a five-game period, to just have one draw in there is a big positive.\"\n\nSesko's 96th-minute strike earns Man Utd point at West Ham\n\n'No win, no trim' - has a haircut become a problem for Man Utd?\n\nCarrick's initial victories over title challengers Manchester City and Arsenal were unexpected. The ones against Fulham and Tottenham were anticipated but did not arrive without problems that had to be solved.\n\nCombined with the failings of Chelsea and Liverpool, the end outcome is United are fourth, with a handy, but by no means pivotal, advantage in the hunt for a Champions League return, something few could visualise in the wake of Ruben Amorim's dismissal following the draw at Leeds on 4 January.\n\n\"We know how hard it is to put a run together in this league,\" said Carrick, whose side are now unbeaten in nine league games, which spanned three managers, including initial interim Darren Fletcher.\n\n\"Sometimes it comes naturally, it flows and everything clicks. You look really dangerous and there's a spark. Sometimes it's a little bit stodgy.\"\n\nThe question being asked of Carrick is whether his side can deliver winning performances against opposition they are expected to beat.\n\nMany felt West Ham were in that category, even though Nuno Espirito Santo's side were aiming for their fourth win in five league games and they had led Chelsea 2-0 in the one that got away.\n\nCarrick did not manage a victory.\n\nWhat he did do was take a risk to try and get something from a game that appeared lost.\n\nWhen Manchester United drew against West Ham at Old Trafford in December, Amorim's only substitution involving an offensive player was Mason Mount for Joshua Zirkzee, 12 minutes from time.\n\nHis last change was one defender, Lisandro Martinez, for another, Luke Shaw. Midfielder Kobbie Mainoo and young forward Shea Lacey remained on the bench.\n\nAt London Stadium, Carrick gambled. Not so much with Sesko, who replaced Matheus Cunha, who had been ineffective, a charge that could be levelled at all United's attacking players on this occasion.\n\nIt was through his introduction of Zirkzee for full-back Diogo Dalot eight minutes from time where the risk and reward element came.\n\nCarrick switched to a back three and pushed men forward.\n\nHe knew there was a chance of conceding a second. It didn't happen, thanks to two superb saving tackles from another substitute, Leny Yoro, and a Senne Lammens save.\n\nIt meant as the clocked ticked past five minutes of injury-time played of the seven added, Carrick's side still had a chance. Sesko's brilliant finish ensured they did not head home empty handed.\n\n\"It's always worth it to try and get something out of the game,\" said Carrick of his substitution.\n\n\"We all want the perfect kind of performance, to be the best we can be.\n\n\"Sometimes it doesn't quite happen, but it doesn't mean you give up.\n\n\"Obviously we went for it, with three at the back and the rest all attacking basically to try and find that goal. That's the way we should do it.\"\n\nIt's an attitude straight out of the Sir Alex Ferguson playbook. He was always prepared to gamble in order to get a desired outcome and felt it was why he enjoyed so many late successes in his stellar career.\n\nAn 87th-minute winner against Arsenal, a 90th-minute winner against Fulham, and now a 95th-minute equaliser against West Ham.\n\nCarrick is pleased with 13 points out of 15 from his first block of games.\n\nAs he regroups before the next run of three matches, he will be just as delighted at the spirit and never-say-die attitude that helped to get them.\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Warning: This article contains discussion around suicide and depression.\n\nFormer Great Britain rugby league player Josh Jones has revealed he came close to taking his own life as a result of what he says are the effects of head injuries sustained while playing the sport.\n\nHaving retired in 2023 because of concussion-related issues, he was then diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) aged 31.\n\nThe degenerative brain disease is linked to repeated blows to the head and causes an increased risk of mental illness.\n\nJones - who made 246 Super League appearances for a number of clubs - is among the youngest and highest-profile claimants in a concussion lawsuit against rugby league authorities.\n\nIn his first interview since quitting the game, the former international second row told BBC Sport he considered suicide during his playing career.\n\n\"It breaks my heart to share this, but the day before the start of a season, I was contemplating ending my life, and that is how dark it got,\" he said.\n\n\"I sat there for hours contemplating [it] because I didn't like the person I was becoming. I felt a burden to my family.\n\n\"It was awful, and the scariest thing was, that evening [my wife] Olivia managed to calm me down and bring me home… and I played the following day.\"\n\nJones says he developed various symptoms after being regularly concussed during training and matches.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Sport from Malaysia, where he and his family now live, he said: \"I noticed that if I was doing simple tasks, like making my children a bottle of water, trying to pour it and trying to steady my hand, putting a card in the card machine, putting the keys in the door, I just couldn't stop my shaking,\" he said.\n\n\"And that's when things progressively started to get worse; headaches, brain fog, neck pain, eye pain… I'm sensitive to light and to noise, anxiety, depression.\n\n\"The scariest thing I find is being unable to regulate my emotions. That terrifies me. I cope with it by just taking myself away. It's been at the detriment sometimes of our marriage and me being a father and as a friend. I very much isolate myself.\n\n\"I would never let my children play, and that's a really sad thing.\"\n\nJones' wife Olivia told BBC Sport that the changes in her husband's personality were \"very gradual at first\" but became \"impossible to ignore\".\n\n\"He went from being confident, energetic, and present to being withdrawn, irritable, forgetful - and he just seemed to be constantly in pain,\" she said.\n\n\"And he often complained about suffering with headaches, brain fog, and anxiety, and it became quite scary for me.\"\n\nJones - who won three caps for Great Britain in 2019 - says he was diagnosed with probable stage 2 CTE in July 2024, after he had finished playing.\n\nThe degenerative brain disease can only be diagnosed definitively after death, and has been linked to dementia.\n\n\"Being told that someone could actually see me and support me and was listening to me, it was just relief, because for so long I'd just been told there's nothing,\" he added.\n\n\"What the governing body was providing for us as players wasn't, in my opinion, good enough, because there's so many players told there's nothing wrong with them.\n\n\"I think there needs to be an independent regulatory body for brain health, not just in rugby league, but throughout sport.\n\n\"My neurologist has said I'm at high risk now of further problems. It scares the life out of me what I put my body through and what's to come.\n\n\"It's heartbreaking, but the hardest thing for me is my children. When I was able to play on a trampoline with them, play football with them in the garden, I loved being a dad.\n\n\"And I almost feel like that, to the full extent, has been taken away from me, because right now I can't do those things, and I've got to explain to my children why.\"\n\nJones and other claimants in the concussion lawsuit argue that the Rugby Football League (RFL) was negligent in failing to take reasonable action to protect them from serious brain injuries.\n\nThey also claim that the organisation should have established and implemented rules on the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of actual or suspected concussive injuries. The governing body denies liability.\n\nWhen asked why he decided to join the legal action, Jones said: \"I've seen a lot of fans questioning the integrity of players, and saying that they knew the risks.\n\n\"I knew I'd have sore shoulders, a bad back, sore knees, maybe arthritis, those sort of physical things. I never knew that I would be left like this - and be living with this neurological damage that the game's given me.\n\n\"For me, it's not the game, it's the governance of the game that's the problem. And to add insult to injury, to be abandoned from the sport - it's not right. The governing body has failed to protect its players, and something needs to be done.\n\n\"I know it's not just me that's suffering. When I retired, I had lots of former team-mates reach out to me and ask me, 'what care have you got, because I'm suffering with the same symptoms as you'.\"\n\nJones says he believes that \"a lack of protocols\" made his symptoms progress.\n\nAfter retirement, Jones tried to forge a career in the financial sector, and then in his father-in-law's demolition business, but said he \"couldn't deal with the high-stress environment or the hours\" and had to \"isolate myself in dark rooms for hours\".\n\n\"It was just another nightmare,\" he said. \"So, right now, I don't do anything. I'm not employed. In a sense, I can't do anything because I can't work a nine-to-five.\n\n\"I need daily treatment. So we had to sell our home to be able to afford to come to the Far East to get cheaper treatment. We're looking to head to New Zealand.\n\n\"I'm speaking to neurologists over there who have got a different approach, who are recommended by other players who are going through this.\n\n\"Being proactive in trying to slow that transition down, because early-onset dementia, that's a very realistic possibility for me. So is Parkinson's, epilepsy.\n\n\"We're just trying to find some help. It has been the hardest time of our lives.\"\n\nOlivia added that watching her husband struggle after he had retired was \"a harsh reality to me as it was 'oh gosh, this is your life now. This isn't just the impact of playing week in, week out. You have now got brain damage'\".\n\n\"We got to a point in England where there was just no quality of life,\" she added.\n\n\"He didn't leave the house, he completely isolated himself. And obviously, I was scared to leave him on his own. I didn't know what to do and how to help him.\"\n\nIn a statement, the RFL said that it \"takes player safety and welfare extremely seriously and it is always extremely sad to hear of any health difficulties experienced by former players\".\n\n\"Rugby League as a sport invests significantly into scientific research, and continues to evolve its approach to help best prevent and manage concussion injuries.\n\n\"As such the sport has never been safer in this regard. The RFL has developed a clear action plan including a target to reduce concussions across the sport by 30% and is on track to meet these targets.\n\n\"Significant help and assistance is given to former professional players through charity provider Rugby League Cares, [which] supports a comprehensive transition programme supporting players during and post their career, including education and hardship grants.\n\n\"A Brain Health Fund has been established offering access to specialist counselling and care - which has provided support to more than 40 former players and their families.\"\n\nSolicitor Richard Boardman of Rylands Garth, the firm representing the claimants, said: \"Josh's problems still stick out, because he should be in the prime of his life.\n\n\"Josh has been so brave to discuss this publicly and our hearts go out to those who are suffering in silence.\"\n\nIn December, after five years of legal arguments, claimants in the litigation across both rugby league and union were refused permission to appeal against a decision ordering them to provide all of their medical records to the defendants.\n\nIf you have been affected by the issues raised in this article, help and support is available via BBC Action Line.",
