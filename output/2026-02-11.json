    "fullText": "As the NBA heads into the 2026 All-Star Weekend, the league’s best playmakers have already put on a masterclass in ball movement and creativity. The assists per game leaders aren’t just piling up numbers — they’re shaping the identity of their teams with vision, timing, and unselfishness. From superstar point guards to versatile big men, this season’s leaders prove that elite passing is still one of basketball’s most beautiful arts.\n\n– 10.7 assists per game\nJokić continues to redefine what playmaking looks like from the center position. His vision is almost point-guard level, threading backdoor passes and cross-court lasers with effortless precision. Denver’s offense flows through him because he reads defenses two steps ahead. What makes his assists special isn’t just the number — it’s how calmly and creatively he creates easy shots for everyone else.\n\n– 9.6 assists per game\nCunningham has fully embraced the role of Detroit’s offensive orchestrator. He controls tempo, keeps defenders on his hip, and consistently finds shooters in rhythm. His size allows him to see over defenses, making sharp reads out of pick-and-roll situations. Cade’s passing has become the heartbeat of the Pistons’ offense.\n\n– 8.6 assists per game\nDončić remains one of the most dangerous dual threats in the league. His scoring gravity forces double teams, and he punishes them with pinpoint passes to cutters and shooters. Luka’s ability to manipulate defenders with hesitation dribbles opens up lanes others simply don’t see. Every possession feels like a chess match — and he’s usually winning it.\n\n– 8.2 assists per game\nJohnson’s playmaking leap has been one of the most impressive developments this season. As a forward, he pushes the pace and makes quick decisions in transition. Atlanta benefits from his versatility, as he can facilitate from the wing or the top of the key. His assists often come from aggressive drives that collapse the defense.\n\n– 8.1 assists per game\nEven years into his career, Harden remains an elite offensive conductor. His mastery of pick-and-roll reads and pocket passes keeps defenses constantly guessing. He patiently surveys the floor before delivering perfectly timed kick-outs to shooters. Harden’s passing IQ continues to age like fine wine.\n\n– 7.6 assists per game\nMurray’s chemistry with Jokić fuels one of the league’s most fluid offenses. He balances scoring and facilitating beautifully, knowing when to attack and when to distribute. His ability to draw help defenders opens clean looks on the perimeter. Murray’s assists often come in high-pressure moments, showcasing his composure.\n\n– 7.5 assists per game\nNembhard has quietly developed into a reliable floor general for Indiana. He makes smart, efficient reads and rarely forces unnecessary passes. His steady presence keeps the Pacers organized, especially in half-court sets. The growth in his assist numbers reflects his increasing confidence and command.\n\n– 7.4 assists per game\nLaMelo’s flair is unmatched when it comes to creative passing. Whether it’s a no-look dime or a full-court hit-ahead pass, he thrives on turning routine plays into highlights. His instinctive feel for spacing allows him to find teammates in stride. Charlotte’s offense sparks whenever he’s orchestrating.\n\n– 7.2 assists per game\nCollier’s emergence as a facilitator has been a bright spot for Utah. He shows maturity beyond his years with his patience in the lane and sharp kick-outs to shooters. His ability to break down defenders off the dribble creates consistent scoring chances for teammates. The assist numbers highlight his growing comfort at the NBA level.\n\n– 7.1 assists per game\nMitchell’s playmaking complements his well-known defensive intensity. He attacks gaps aggressively, forcing rotations that lead to open looks. His improved court awareness has elevated Miami’s ball movement this season. Mitchell’s assists often come from hustle plays that turn defense into offense.\n\nWith the spotlight of All-Star Weekend shining bright, these assist leaders have earned their place among the league’s most impactful players. Their ability to elevate teammates and control the flow of the game makes them invaluable every single night. As the second half of the season unfolds, expect their playmaking brilliance to continue defining the race toward the playoffs.\n\nSUPER BOWL: Way-too-early 2027 Super Bowl odds following NFL season\n\nNFL DRAFT: Updated 2026 NFL Draft order following Seahawks’ Super Bowl 60 win\n\nCBB: 2026 college basketball rankings, updated AP Top 25 for Week 15\n\nMLB: League advised teams to ‘tell players to carry their papers’ to avoid ICE detention\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: Shocking details emerge from James Pearce Jr, Rickea Jackson domestic dispute\n\nThe post NBA assists per game season leaders before the 2026 All-Star weekend appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "The Baltimore Ravens don’t have a Lamar Jackson decision; they have a Lamar Jackson math problem. And it’s the kind you don’t solve by squinting harder.\n\nMultiple credible reports have the same flashing red headline – Jackson’s 2026 cap hit is scheduled to spike to $74.5 million, which is roughly a quarter of the team cap if the league lands around the low-$300M range. That number isn’t just tight, it’s roster-build prohibitive.\n\nMORE: Updated 2026 NFL Draft order following Seahawks’ Super Bowl 60 win\n\nThat’s why Baltimore’s messaging has shifted. The Ravens have talked openly about wanting a new deal done before free agency in March to create flexibility. And the league-wide reporting got even louder this week: Jackson is expected to enter extension talks this offseason, and he’s reportedly been involved in coaching hires. That’s franchise-QB leverage right there.\n\nNow the “fun” part. The Ravens’ best option isn’t just to pay him more – it’s to rearrange the front room furniture. Extensions and restructures are cap calculus, and not only possible but probable. But if Baltimore doesn’t lower that 2026 hit, every other decision gets exceedingly more difficult – retaining key starters, adding any meaningful free agents, even keeping quality depth.\n\nAnd subtext, you say? Jackson represents himself. Which means this negotiation won’t have an agent smoothing the corners. It’ll be direct, intentional, and very personal.\n\nAt this point, the storyline centers around how they pay Lamar (who owns multiple MVPs), and keep the roster from collapsing around him.  The stakes couldn’t be higher.\n\nSUPER BOWL: Way-too-early 2027 Super Bowl odds following NFL season\n\nCBB: 2026 college basketball rankings, updated AP Top 25 for Week 15\n\nMLB: League advised teams to ‘tell players to carry their papers’ to avoid ICE detention\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: Shocking details emerge from James Pearce Jr, Rickea Jackson domestic dispute\n\nThe post Ravens, Lamar Jackson have serious roster decisions to make ahead of free agency  appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "PDC darts superstars - Wessel Nijman career highlights, key facts and top stats to know originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe career of Wessel Nijman is not a straight line. It never was. It is a story shaped by talent that arrived early, consequences that arrived faster, and a long, grinding journey back toward credibility, relevance, and respect.\n\nDarts Used: 23g Mission Signature\n\nWalk-On Song: Summer of 69 – Bryan Adams\n\nPDC Ranking (start of 2026): 29th\n\nPDC Pro/Euro Tour Titles Won: 4\n\nAs a teenager, Nijman looked like something the Netherlands simply produced as standard issue – effortless scoring power, a loose arm, and a rhythm that suggested the board owed him favours. Success came quickly. Too quickly, perhaps. Titles followed, expectations ballooned, and his name began circulating as one of the sport’s next inevitabilities rather than merely a promising newcomer. Then everything stopped.\n\nWESSEL NIJMAN IN FACTS AND FIGURES: Check out WESSEL's full career profile on dartsdatabase.co.uk\n\nThe match-fixing ban that followed did more than remove him from competition – it stripped him of momentum, identity, and trust. For years, Nijman existed in darts purgatory, his talent remembered but his future uncertain. It is one thing to rebuild a game. It is another to rebuild belief – from fans, from officials, and from himself.\n\nWhat followed was not redemption wrapped in sentiment. It was repetition. Hours of unseen work. Quiet tournaments. Incremental progress without applause. Nijman returned not as a prodigy, but as a professional forced to relearn patience, humility, and control. The arm was still there. The scoring remained heavy. But now it was accompanied by caution, by awareness, by an understanding that nothing would be handed back cheaply.\n\nGradually, the results began to speak again. Not in one thunderous announcement, but in accumulation – averages climbing, finishes sticking, performances stabilising under pressure. His return to the PDC circuit was not framed as a comeback story so much as a resumption, a sense that unfinished business was finally being addressed with clarity rather than entitlement.\n\nWhat defines Nijman now is not just his scoring power, but his temperament. There is less flash, more calculation. Less impatience, more structure. He plays like someone acutely aware of what it costs to lose everything – and how fragile opportunity can be.\n\nWESSEL NIJMAN OPENS UP ABOUT REBUILDING HIS CAREER  - Watch Wessel Pay Tribute to Darryl Fitton\n\nThe modern Wessel Nijman is not chasing forgiveness. He is chasing legitimacy. And in a sport that respects performance above narrative, that may be the most effective approach of all. His career will always carry an asterisk in some conversations. That is unavoidable. But darts, ultimately, is ruthless in its simplicity. You either perform, or you disappear. Nijman, quietly, deliberately, has chosen the former. Oh … and the reason he hasn’t got a nickname? Dislikes them and thinks they’re silly. Fair enough.\n\nFor the full stories and \n\nDarts World subscriptions options include Print, Digital and All Access packages, as well as exclusive products and competitions",

    "fullText": "Barcelona head coach Hansi Flick faced the media on the eve of a massive Copa del Rey semi-final clash against Atletico Madrid at the Metropolitano.\n\nThe Blaugrana travel as defending champions, but the challenge ahead is clear, with Diego Simeone’s side known for their intensity and organisation in knockout ties.\n\nFlick began by confirming that Marcus Rashford will not be part of the squad for the first leg, dealing a blow to Barcelona’s attacking options.\n\nSpeaking about the English forward’s condition, the manager said,\n\n“Rashford isn’t ready. He took a knock. It’s not good news, but I believe in my team. The situation isn’t easy. We’re playing against a fantastic team.\n\n“I saw the cup game against Betis, and it was impressive. Cholo [Diego Simeone] is doing a great job at Atletico. I really appreciate what I saw. It’ll be a tough game tomorrow.”\n\nThe German coach also revealed that Raphinha is unlikely to feature, stressing the need to protect the Brazilian from further issues.\n\nRaphinha and Rashford will miss this match. (Photo by Judit Cartiel/Getty Images)\n\nProviding an update on the winger, Flick explained, “Step by step. We have to take care of him. He’s a player who gives his all with great intensity.\n\n“If he feels something, we have to be careful. That’s the situation. I’m not happy because we need him, just like Pedri, Gavi, Andreas, and Marcus.\n\n“He’s feeling something in his muscles and we have to take care of his body. We have to support him and keep an eye on him.”\n\nLooking ahead to the two-legged tie, Flick emphasised the importance of managing the full 180 minutes rather than just the first leg in Madrid.\n\n“These two games will decide who goes through to the final. That’s the goal for both teams. Last season was tough. We played at home first.\n\n“It’s two games, 180 minutes, and we’re ready to go to the final.”\n\nWith both Rashford and Raphinha unavailable, questions were raised about the left-wing position.\n\nFlick kept his cards close to his chest, saying, “We have a very clear idea of who will play and who is doing well.”\n\nWhen asked about the difficulty of playing Atletico away, the Barcelona boss insisted his focus remains only on the upcoming match.\n\nHe responded, “I’m just focusing on the game against Atlético, I don’t like to look at other things. Statistics are fine for you guys, but I don’t think about them.\n\n“Atletico deserves respect because they’re a fantastic team, coach and club. We like to test ourselves against these opponents.”\n\nThe coach also made headlines when he was asked about Barcelona’s route to the semi-final.\n\nHe chose to reference Real Madrid’s shock defeat to Albacete, simply stating, “Ask Real Madrid,” in response to suggestions that Barcelona had an easier path.\n\nHe later clarified his remarks, stressing the need to respect lower-division sides. Flick said,\n\n“It doesn’t help me to talk about Real Madrid. I thought it was the right response because we have to respect the Second and Third Division teams in the Cup, who have had a fantastic Cup run.\n\n“It’s about respecting your opponents. The other teams have qualified, they have the quality and they have shown that they can beat First Division teams.\n\n“That’s all there is to it. I just have to focus on my club, my team, my fans, and that’s all I’m interested in. The rest is just a waste of energy.”\n\nFlick shared his thoughts on Araujo’s situation. (Photo by Alex Caparros/Getty Images)\n\nThe manager also spoke about Ronald Araujo, highlighting the defender’s mental strength after opening up about his struggles.\n\nFlick explained, “We know the situation with Ronald. He has opened up, and we have supported him as much as we can.\n\n“Opening up like that means you are strong. In football, it’s all about mentality and focusing on winning. Someday I’ll talk about everything.\n\n“When he says he was like that for a year and a half, it’s important to take care of the players.\n\n“You have to think about it. As a coach, you have to take responsibility for all the players. You have to think about more than just what’s good for you.”\n\nOn Jules Kounde, Flick praised the defender’s mentality and fighting spirit. He said,\n\n“Jules is a fighter. We’re human and maybe you can’t have the best day, but he’s always fighting. Even when he doesn’t start well.\n\n“I appreciate what he’s doing. He has a top mentality. Tomorrow he’ll prove it. It will be a difficult game for everyone. I like what I see from Atlético, with a clear philosophy.”\n\nFinally, the German coach reserved special praise for teenage sensation Lamine Yamal, who continues to grow in importance for the team. Flick noted,\n\n“I’m very happy with everything I see from him. On the pitch, he’s always capable of deciding games in the right direction.\n\nHe’s a great player and has everything we like in football: dribbling, one-on-one.\n\n“He’s very good to watch. I’m very happy with what I see. In training, he always wants to improve, and that’s good.\n\n“He has to improve, and he can improve a lot in the coming years,” he concluded.",

    "fullText": "Tom Brady delivered a reality check to Logan Paul after the WWE star attempted to talk up his athletic credentials ahead of a celebrity flag football event.\n\nThe exchange quickly went viral, with fans enjoying the seven-time Super Bowl champion calmly shutting down the bravado.\n\nThe moment unfolded on the ImPaulsive podcast, where Logan Paul revealed the upcoming opportunity.\n\n“I’m told that I’m being flown out to Saudi Arabia to compete in a Fanatics flag football game with you.”\n\nBrady responded without hesitation, stating: “I’m actually a little worried for you because you’re a good athlete, but these guys are on another level.”\n\nThe comment immediately shifted the tone. While Paul framed the event as a stage to showcase his athleticism, Brady emphasized the caliber of players involved.\n\nThe flag football game is expected to feature current and former NFL stars, athletes whose training and experience far exceed recreational competition.\n\nBrady’s warning was not framed as disrespect, but as perspective. He acknowledged Paul’s physical ability while drawing a clear line between entertainment sport and elite football.\n\nPaul pushed back confidently when Brady questioned the comparison, “I’m the highest level. I’m the level.”\n\nHe went on to reference his high school football background and athletic WWE performances as proof of his credentials. Brady, however, was unmoved.\n\n“No, you’re not the level. You’re a good athlete, but when I’m thinking of Saquon Barkley, Odell Beckham, Justin Jefferson… it’s cute. I love WWE, it’s very cute, but this is like real football, this is real competition.”\n\nThe contrast between the two perspectives made the clip compelling. Paul leaned into confidence and showmanship, while Brady anchored the discussion in professional standards.\n\nFor Paul, the moment added intrigue to the upcoming event. For Brady, it was another example of calmly reinforcing what separates great athletes from great entertainers.\n\nAlix Earle’s ‘didn’t go to bed’ revelation ignites Tom Brady dating rumors\n\nDrake Maye surpasses unfortunate Tom Brady New England Patriots record in Super Bowl loss\n\nWhy Tom Brady was confused with Scottie Scheffler preferring to be a ‘better father’ than golfer",

    "fullText": "Daniel Cormier believes Jon Jones’ arthritis revelation was far from accidental.\n\nJon Jones sparked widespread debate after footage surfaced of him discussing severe hip arthritis during a public appearance in Houston.\n\nThe former UFC heavyweight champion later claimed the exchange was recorded without his knowledge. Cormier, however, has publicly questioned that explanation and suggested there may be more behind the situation.\n\nJon Jones stated that someone wearing Meta glasses captured the conversation while he was speaking about his hip condition.\n\nHe maintained that the discussion was intended to be private and criticised the individual who shared it online.\n\nDaniel Cormier disputed that version of events during a recent appearance on his YouTube channel. He pointed out that the glasses display a visible recording light that would be noticeable at close range.\n\n“It’s very easy to tell if you’re being recorded with the Meta glasses. They’ve got a white light on the side of the glasses the moment they start recording.”\n\nCormier added that years spent in the spotlight tend to sharpen awareness of cameras and recording devices. In his view, it would be difficult for someone with Jones’ experience to miss those signals.\n\nAfter laying out his doubts, Cormier made his central claim about the incident. “I think Jon Jones knew what he was doing, and that he wanted people to know he’s injured.”\n\nJones had revealed that his hip is covered in arthritis and that he has already qualified for surgery. The admission has intensified speculation about whether he will compete again.\n\nAlthough skeptical about how the footage became public, Cormier acknowledged the injury itself may be genuine.\n\n“For the first time, I actually believe that he might have some true issues with his hips. I believe Jon Jones is hurt.”\n\nCormier suggested fans should begin preparing for the possibility that Jones’ time in the Octagon is nearing its end. The arthritis diagnosis has now cast significant doubt over any potential comeback plans.\n\nJon Jones meets Demetrious Johnson and reaches an agreement on GOAT debate\n\nJon Jones changes course once more as uncertainty surrounds UFC return\n\nJon Jones admits he wants no ‘smoke’ from 5’3 MMA star who can ‘choke out’ Dwight Howard",

    "description": "Identifying the building blocks for Robert Saleh and his Tennessee Titans defense in 2026.",
    "fullText": "The Tennessee Titans made the decision to appoint a defensive minded head coach in Robert Saleh. Saleh hired Gus Bradley to be his defensive coordinator. Together, they’ll apply the teachings the head coach plans to install on that side of the ball.\n\nSaleh will be the defensive play-caller. His history as the former New York Jets head coach and San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator has taught us about his preferred philosophies. Linebackers are dynamic assets in his defense, he appreciates a pass-rushing interior lineman, and values speed/athleticism at EDGE.\n\nThe Titans’ roster desperately requires improving this offseason. As it stands, who are the defensive chess-pieces Saleh could build his defensive scheme around? We’ve identified a small handful.\n\nSaleh has coached some phenomenal defensive players throughout his career, but Jeffery Simmons will rank near the top. Don’t expect Simmons’ role to change much under Saleh. He’s coming off an All-Pro and Bowl year as a dominant pass rusher who registered a career-high 11.0 sacks.\n\nSimmons has established himself as an elite pass-rushing three-technique. Saleh’s defense will be built around how Simmons wrecks opposing offenses. He is the core foundational star moving forward.\n\nSaleh has developed several linebackers throughout his coaching career, including Fred Warner, Jamien Sherwood, and Quincy Williams. That’s terrific news for third-year linebacker Cedric Gray. Gray is coming off a breakout season in which he accumulated 164 tackles.\n\nSaleh will ask Gray to play an aggressive brand of football. The former North Carolina standout will be tasked with shedding blocks as a run defender. Gray could improve in zone coverage, as Saleh’s defense demands his linebackers to be instinctual around the middle of the field.\n\nSophomore safety Kevin Winston Jr. is a potential breakout star. Winston was excellent when healthy for the Titans in 2026, coming up with 34 tackles and a sack in 10 appearances. He should be thrilled about Saleh’s arrival.\n\nSaleh wants physicality and instincts at safety. Winston (and Amani Hooker) check multiple boxes.\n\nNotably absent are defensive tackle T’Vondre Sweat, and any cornerback/EDGE on the roster. Sweat’s fit in Saleh’s defense is questionable and to be determined based on previous history. Elsewhere, the Titans desperately need upgrades at cornerback and EDGE for Saleh to legitimize the defense.",

    "fullText": "Barcelona’s preparations for the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final against Atletico Madrid have taken a worrying turn, with several key players missing from training.\n\nThe biggest concern surrounds Raphinha, who did not take part in the latest training session.\n\nAccording to journalist Alfredo Martinez, the Brazilian winger is already ruled out for the first leg against Atletico.\n\nThis is another setback for the player, who had already missed the recent matches against Albacete and Mallorca due to physical problems.\n\nMarcus Rashford is also a serious doubt. The English forward did not train with the group on Wednesday, which has increased fears about his availability.\n\nHe had picked up a heavy knock to his knee during the game against Mallorca, and the issue appears to be more serious than first expected.\n\nProviding an update on the situation, Martinez confirmed the worrying news, writing, “Raphinha is not training ahead of the game against Atletico Madrid. He will be out for the first leg.”\n\nRashford will be doubtful for the Atletico Madrid clash. (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\nHe also revealed the wider situation inside the squad, adding that “Marcus Rashford is also absent and Pedri, Gavi, and Andreas Christensen are also out.”\n\nThe update on Rashford’s condition has only added to the tension around the camp. Martinez explained that “Rashford didn’t train with the group yesterday. Against Mallorca, he had a bad knock on the knee.\n\n“He may be out of the game tomorrow.”\n\nWith the forward still not training normally, his presence in Madrid remains uncertain.\n\nFor Hansi Flick, this creates a real selection dilemma, as both Raphinha and Rashford are regular options on the left side of the attack, and losing both at the same time forces the manager to rethink his plans for the first leg.\n\nThere was, however, a small positive sign from the training session. Several academy players were called up to work with the first team, including Tommy Marques, Jofre Torrents, Brian Farinas, and Juan Hernandez.\n\nTheir inclusion suggests that opportunities could open up if the injury problems continue.",

    "title": "Bengals free agency: The best linebackers for Cincinnati to target",
    "description": "Leo Chenal seems like an ideal candidate to join the Cincinnati Bengals.",
    "fullText": "The Cincinnati Bengals drafted Demetrius Knight II in the second round of the 2025 NFL Draft. Two rounds later, they selected Barrett Carter. Both players ended up as starting linebackers for the majority of the season.\n\nBoth players went through ups and downs during their rookie seasons. Missed tackles in particular have been a problem for the linebackers. Knight finished the season with 16 missed tackles on the year (15% missed tackle rate). Carter had 18 of his own (14.8% missed tackle rate).\n\nThe Bengals would be wise to add a talented free agent at the position this offseason. Let’s take a look at some of the top projected players at the position this year.\n\nLloyd is a 27-year-old linebacker who just had the best season of his career in Jacksonville. He finished the year with 87 tackles, 1.5 sacks, and 5 interceptions. He was impressive as a run defender with an 85.2 grade during the year. His 78.9 coverage grade was equally impressive. He did have some issues with missed tackles, though. Lloyd registered 12 total during the 2025 season.\n\nThe former first-round draft pick is projected to sign a 3-year contract for around $48 million in March.\n\nOne of the youngest free agent linebackers to hit the market this year will be Chenal. He posted PFF grades of 72.6 in coverage, 76.2 as a run defender, and had a 71.5 tackling grade in 2025. He had 58 tackles, 2 sacks, and 1 interception on the season. He has generated 48 pressures since 2022. He missed just 4 total tackles during the 2025 season (8.2% missed tackle rate).\n\nChenal is currently projected to sign a contract for around 2 years and $12 million total. The Bengals should absolutely be interested at that price.\n\nBush was a player that many expected to end up on the Bengals during the 2019 draft. The Steelers traded up in front of the Bengals to secure him. While he never worked out in Pittsburgh, he has been tremendous over the past two seasons with the Cleveland Browns. Bush had 125 tackles, 2 sacks, 3 interceptions, and 2 forced fumbles in 2025. He posted grades of 80.4 in coverage, 87.3 as a run defender, and had a 76.9 tackling grade.\n\nBush will turn 28 in July. His contract projection is for 3 years and $36 million. His 7% missed tackle rate during the season is the best for any player mentioned so far in this article.\n\nDean dealt with injuries throughout much of the 2025 season for the Philadelphia Eagles. He still finished the year with 61 tackles, 4 sacks, and 2 forced fumbles. He had a 62.6 coverage grade, a 42.4 run defense grade, and a 54.9 tackle grade. He missed 10 tackles on the season (14.5% missed tackle rate). Dean is still just 25 years old, and he is one of the best blitzing linebackers in this free agent class.\n\nDean’s contract projection is currently 3 years and $41 million dollars.\n\nWagner will be turning 36 years old in June. However, he is still playing at a high level as a run defender, while being an effective player on the blitz. Wagner had 162 tackles, 4.5 sacks, and 2 interceptions this year for Washington. He had an extremely impressive 4.8% missed tackle rate. The coverage grade was only 52.3, but for teams looking for a reliable tackler with leadership qualities, Wagner should be high on the list.\n\nHe is projected to sign another one-year contract worth around $8.5 million.\n\nDavis is another older veteran linebacker. There is a connection here with the Bengals linebacker coach Mike Hodges having coached Davis in New Orleans. The 37-year-old recorded 143 tackles, 2 forced fumbles, and .5 sack during the 2025 season. He had a 68.3 coverage grade, 88.9 run defense grade, and a 67.1 tackling grade. He had 17 missed tackles on the year (11.2% missed tackle rate). He is projected to sign for around $8 million dollars for one season.\n\nOther projected free agent linebackers include Alex Anzalone, Kaden Elliss, Quay Walker, Germaine Pratt, Justin Strnad, Willie Gay, Eric Kendricks, Matt Milano, Quincy Williams, Alex Singleton, Elandon Roberts, Shaq Thompson, Lavonte David, Cole Holcomb, and Jerome Baker.",

    "fullText": "Brian Rolapp has already built up a good deal of credibility, but there’s still some unease among fans about what the PGA Tour will look like once he’s had a chance to put his stamp on it.\n\nMost of Rolapp’s influence so far has been happening out of sight. He was appointed CEO too late to really shape the 2026 season, so any major changes won’t show up until later.\n\nBut significant changes are likely in 2027. Harris English has mentioned hearing that future PGA Tour schedules could be reduced to just 20 events.\n\nThis idea fits with Rolapp’s previous comments about scarcity, a concept he’s referenced when discussing his vision for the Tour.\n\nThere is definitely a need for change within the PGA Tour. Still, as preparations for 2027 begin, Rolapp is starting to see just how difficult those changes might be to implement.\n\nThe PGA Tour dropped a trailer for next month’s Players Championship. The video itself did a good job building excitement around the flagship event at TPC Sawgrass.\n\nBut all the talk was focused on the closing line: “March is going to be major.”\n\nThe intention behind it seems clear enough. The PGA Tour is looking to get as much as they can out of their biggest event.\n\nEven so, there’s been plenty of pushback. Lee Westwood even suggested that the slogan revealed some underlying nerves within the tour about where things are headed.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just those aligned with LIV Golf who were left puzzled by it. Many others have also questioned whether promoting The Players Championship as a major in all but name makes sense for the PGA Tour.\n\n“It was only three years ago that you had players seriously pushing back at suggestions that we needed five or six majors in golf, and nothing has happened since then to change anyone’s mind,” said Chamblee.\n\nWhile few agree with Chamblee’s suggestion, there hasn’t been any real push from officials to elevate The Players to major status. Still, Rolapp now has a sense of what happens when you even hint at going against golf’s traditions.\n\nIf the new schedule does cut down to around 25 events, several well-known tournaments will be left out. That kind of change is bound to upset fans and players who have strong ties to those stops on the calendar.\n\nIt’s also likely that many events with local importance will lose their place in the lineup. These decisions go beyond just tradition – they can impact communities that have relied on these tournaments for years.\n\nNo tournament lasts forever, but removing so many at once will be felt differently than just a few changes over time.\n\nRolapp’s focus is clearly on making each event feel more important within a smaller schedule. But that approach means some difficult cuts, and not everyone will agree with which ones stay or go.\n\nWhile there’s some belief that his vision could work out in the long run, he’ll need thick skin early on. If reactions like the one to The Players Championship promo are any indication, it won’t be an easy path forward.\n\nBrandel Chamblee explains why young talent joined LIV Golf, and it’s not just about the money\n\nJustin Rose confirms ‘the only reason’ he still wants to play golf as he reaches world number three\n\nF1 champion Nigel Mansell was ‘very proud’ after shooting 66 at PGA Tour event",

    "fullText": "US superstar Chloe Kim said \"muscle memory\" had kicked in as she began her quest for a historic Olympic women's snowboard hat-trick on Wednesday by topping qualifying at Livigno Snow Park.\n\nKim, who had an injury-disrupted build-up to the Milan-Cortina Games, shot to the top of the halfpipe qualifying times with a score of 90.25 on her first run.\n\nJapan's Sara Shimizu, who won silver at last year's world championships, was second on the charts after posting 87.50 in the second of her two runs, with America's Maddie Mastro third (86.00).\n\nNo snowboarder, man or woman, has won three gold medals at consecutive Olympics -- with two athletes missing the chance to do so earlier in the Games in Italy.\n\nKim, who suffered a dislocated shoulder last month while training in Switzerland, denied she felt rusty despite her lack of recent competitive action.\n\n\"I've been doing this for 22 years, OK? Muscle memory is a thing. I might be better at snowboarding than I am at walking,\" she said.\n\n\"But no, it didn't feel rusty. Obviously there's some nerves, but I think at the Olympics, I'm just so happy that I made it, especially this time around. So I honestly feel like I wasn't as nervous as the previous ones.\"\n\nThe 25-year-old said she had been able to put her shoulder injury out of her mind.\n\n\"I feel like my shoulder's been really good. She's been very well-behaved, so I'm grateful for that,\" she said.\n\n\"We haven't had any hiccups. I've been working relentlessly on getting it as strong as possible and obviously the shoulder brace is really helpful.\n\n\"We have amazing medical staff. I have an amazing physical therapist. So it takes a village, but it's working, so go team.\"\n\nTwo-time defending champion Kim has dominated women's halfpipe since the 2022 Beijing Games, winning X Games gold in 2024 and 2025 and claiming her third world championship title last year.\n\nEster Ledecka, from the Czech Republic, and Austria's Anna Gasser have both blown their chances of becoming the first snowboarders in Olympic history to win three titles in a row over the past few days.\n\nKim said it would be a \"cool\" to be the first snowboarder to achieve the feat but was adamant she was satisfied with her career.\n\n\"I'm proud that I've been able to push it as far as I have, so we'll see how it goes down tomorrow night,\" she said.\n\nChinese veteran Liu Jiayu, the silver medallist at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games, landed heavily towards the end of her second run, lying motionless on her back in the snow.\n\nOfficials raced towards her and she received lengthy medical treatment before being towed away on a stretcher, with her condition unknown.\n\nIn the halfpipe, competitors perform a series of tricks while snowboarding down a slope with a semi-cylindrical shape. They are scored on the breadth and difficulty of the jumps.\n\nThe top 12 qualifiers advanced to the final with scores based on the better of their two runs.",

    "fullText": "Researchers have long believed that a sudden, massive deluge filled a dry, salt-filled Mediterranean some 5 million years ago. Turns out that probably didn't happen, but there was still drama aplenty.\n\r02.09.2026\n\nOn October 6, 1970, the deep-sea drilling vessel Glomar Challenger returned to port in Lisbon, Portugal, bearing a cargo that would revise history. During its 54-day voyage, the Challenger had punched 28 holes into the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea. The recovered cores pointed toward a startling conclusion: About 6 million years ago, the sea had turned into a desert: a vast, barren, salt-filled bowl more than two kilometers deep. Half a million years after that, the Atlantic Ocean had burst through what is now the Strait of Gibraltar and unleashed the largest flood in history.\n\nKenneth Hsü, an oceanographer who was one of the two lead scientists on the Challenger expedition, imagined the scene vividly in the December 1972 issue of Scientific American:\n\n“Cascading at a rate of 10,000 cubic miles per year, the Gibraltar Falls would have been 100 times bigger than Victoria Falls and 1,000 times more so than Niagara.… What a spectacle it must have been for the African ape-men, if any were lured by the thunderous roar.”\n\nThe catastrophe story was a hit: David Attenborough filmed a documentary about it, and Gibraltar even issued a 5-pence stamp portraying the “3,000-metre waterfall.” The two hypotheses — first, that the Mediterranean Sea became landlocked during a half-million-year period known as the Messinian salinity crisis, and second, that it was restored by a cataclysmic deluge through the Strait of Gibraltar, dubbed the Zanclean flood — have been conventional wisdom among geologists for more than 50 years.\n\nHowever, fresh doubts have arisen recently about every part of this story, from the mega-desert to the mega-Niagara. Many geologists have argued for a much briefer desiccation followed by a far more gradual refilling of the Mediterranean. Some think that the Mediterranean never completely disconnected from the Atlantic at all. “The idea of a megaflood, and the data that supports it, are mostly flawed,” says Guillermo Booth Rea of the University of Granada in Spain.\n\nThe most startling recent twist is that the floodway, if there was one, may not have been anywhere near the present-day Strait of Gibraltar, which separates southern Spain from Morocco. For 50 years, new research suggests, we have been looking for signs of a megaflood in the wrong place.\n\nIn the present-day Mediterranean, about three times more water is lost every year to evaporation than is recaptured from rainfall and rivers. The Atlantic makes up for the difference, supplying a steady west-to-east current of seawater through the Strait of Gibraltar. As the sea’s water evaporates, the remaining water becomes saltier and denser and sinks to the bottom. The dense water then flows back out of the strait, east to west, underneath the less dense inbound water. This outflow prevents salt from accumulating in the Mediterranean.\n\nBut what would happen if the strait were constricted, or shut off entirely? Given the hugely negative budget of fresh water, “sea level” in the Mediterranean Sea would drop rapidly, by as much as a kilometer in 2,000 years. Such a scenario would have seemed like science fiction until the Glomar Challenger’s 1970 expedition.\n\nAt the first drill site, the Challenger’s drill bit jammed on a very hard layer 200 meters below the bottom of the sea. The next day, Hsü and his co-lead scientist, William Ryan of Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, found out why. “It brought up buckets full of gravel,” Ryan says.\n\nSeafloors don’t often contain beds of gravel, and when they do, it is usually continental rocks washed down from the adjacent land. But this gravel had marine fossils and rock, mixed with crystals of gypsum. Geologists call gypsum an “evaporite,” because in the present-day world it forms in evaporating shallow bodies of water — as in the Dead Sea, for example. The implication was startling. “When Ken held up the gypsum crystals, he turned to me and asked, ‘Do you think the Mediterranean dried out?’” Ryan remembers.\n\nThe same story was repeated at every stop. Ryan and Hsü found other evaporites like halite (sodium chloride, aka table salt). Oxygen isotopes in seashells embedded in the gravel suggested that these unlucky animals had lived in a brine from which 90 percent of the original water had evaporated. Hsü and Ryan also gathered evidence that the colliding of the African and Eurasian tectonic plates had lifted up the land on both ends of the Mediterranean Sea, closing its former connection with the Indian Ocean and narrowing the connection with the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe clinching piece of evidence came to light after the Challenger mission had ended. Other geologists discovered what appear to be buried ancient beds of several rivers that flow into the Mediterranean, particularly the Nile and the Rhône. It looked as if those rivers once emptied into the Mediterranean at least a kilometer below their present outlets — something that would be possible only if the sea level of the Mediterranean had been a kilometer below the global sea level at some point in the past.\n\nIn 1973, a meeting in Utrecht, Netherlands, established the desiccation model as the consensus theory. But a considerable amount of dissent has emerged in the last 20 years. “In the 1970s, the desiccation people won the debate,” says Wout Krijgsman of Utrecht University, “but there are several aspects it cannot really explain.”\n\nIn part, the dissent reflects an improved understanding of what was occurring on Earth and in the area 6 million years ago. Since 1973, the story told by rocks, core samples and seismic soundings — and, increasingly, by computer simulations — has become more detailed and more dynamic, with changing shorelines, land bridges and volcanoes, and repeated episodes of climate change.\n\nAlso, there were fundamental problems with the desiccation hypothesis to begin with. Take the evaporites, for example: They do not have to form via evaporation, says sedimentologist and stratigrapher Vinicio Manzi of the University of Parma in Italy. They can also form by precipitation from a sufficiently concentrated brine. This can happen underwater, so there is no need to posit that the Mediterranean went bone dry.\n\nAnd the buried riverbeds? Those, too, Manzi and his colleagues can explain: The sinking of briny water can produce downhill currents (“dense shelf water cascading,” in geology lingo) sufficiently strong to scour out a canyon.\n\nThe idea of a single evaporation event also faces a mathematical problem: The existing salt deposit is too big to be explained by a single evaporation event. It represents about 5 percent of the salt in the world’s oceans (and may have originally been 7 to 10 percent). To collect that much salt, the Mediterranean would have had to empty and refill about 10 times.\n\nIn fact, evidence from salt deposits in Sicily suggests something like that actually happened. There, gypsum beds alternate with shale beds that are rich in organic material and could have formed in periods when the gateway between the Atlantic and Mediterranean was open. There are 16 beds in all, with ages spaced about 23,000 years apart.\n\nThis periodicity is well known to geologists: It’s the time it takes for Earth’s axis (like a wobbly top) to trace one complete circle. And it correlates with changes in climate and ancient sea levels the world over. With the presumptive Gibraltar gateway being so shallow during this period, sea level fluctuations due to this “precessional cycle” could have repeatedly opened and closed the connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic.\n\nThat period of gypsum formation is now called Stage 1 of the salinity crisis. Stage 2 was a relatively brief 50,000-year period when (in the majority opinion) the gateway slammed entirely shut, the sea level in the Mediterranean plummeted, and huge deposits of halite (sodium chloride) precipitated out from the seawater. However, Manzi’s group strongly dissents, arguing that the Gibraltar gateway remained open, but shallowed to such an extent that the water flowed through it in one direction only — in but not out — resulting in a runaway buildup of salt.\n\nEven for adherents of the majority view, Stage 2 is not as simple as it seems. Data from chlorine isotopes suggest that the drawdown was not uniform. At its lowest point, in the western Mediterranean, sea level was 800 meters below its present level, while east of present-day Sicily it was at least twice as deep as that. If so, the east and west portions must have been separated by a land bridge. Indeed, there is evidence of African animals crossing over to Europe during this time.\n\nThe last 200,000 years of the salinity crisis, called Stage 3, have been the most puzzling of all. The halite stopped precipitating and there is evidence for a variety of sea levels in the Mediterranean during this time. Widespread fossils of a shrimp-like animal called an ostracod suggest that the waters became much less salty, so that the Mediterranean was a sea-sized lake (and indeed, this stage is sometimes called the Lago-Mare stage). But if the gateway to the Atlantic was still closed, then where did the fresher water come from?\n\nA 2025 paper by Daniel García-Castellanos of the Spanish National Research Council helps solve the puzzle. Using a computer to model erosion, he argues that the Mediterranean was gradually refilling during Stage 3. The ostracods provide a clue to the source. They originated from the area of the present-day Black and Caspian Seas, which back then were connected to each other, but not to the Mediterranean.\n\nWith the shores of the Mediterranean being so newly exposed and so steep, its edges would have rapidly eroded toward today’s Black Sea, which at that time was a much larger freshwater lake called the Paratethys. The first connection between them could have been established at this time. If so, the Mediterranean began to receive waters from rivers like the Volga, the Don and the Danube, which had previously been unavailable. The ostracods got a new home, and the Mediterranean got a vast new supply of water, which according to the computer simulation raised its surface to within 300 meters of its current level.\n\nAccording Krijgsman, this interpretation conveniently reconciles the conflicting evidence. “In the fight between a desiccated and full Mediterranean,” says Krijgsman, García-Castellanos’ paper does the job “if you want to sit in the middle and give everyone credit for their observations.”\n\nThe literature on the Messinian salinity crisis is voluminous, and yet one thing is curiously absent. There is surprisingly little direct evidence of the megaflood that supposedly ended the crisis. Hsü’s original Scientific American article devotes only half a page to it and adduces little in the way of evidence. Fifty years later, Ryan wrote a 100-page retrospective; only three pages are about the megaflood. Shouldn’t this extraordinary flood have left very clear scars?\n\nThe current evidence is ambiguous at best. Geologists have found submerged flood-like deposits off Malta — but that’s a long way from Gibraltar, the putative source of the flood. Also, if the Atlantic drained into a nearly empty Mediterranean basin, then sea levels around the world should have dropped by about nine meters — an anti-flood to pay for the Mediterranean flood. There is no sign that this happened, says García-Castellanos.\n\nA recent deep-sea drilling expedition to the Strait of Gibraltar turned up more questions than answers. In December 2023, the JOIDES Resolution — heir to the Glomar Challenger — revisited the Alboran Sea immediately to the east of the Strait of Gibraltar. If the strait is the door to the Mediterranean, then the Alboran Sea is the vestibule. Any megaflood that passed through the Strait of Gibraltar would have passed also through the Alboran basin. But Rachel Flecker of the University of Bristol, England, co-leader of the expedition, says they found no traces of the flood in the cores they collected.\n\nWhile still on board the ship, she wrote that the cores were “exquisitely laminated in a variety of colors. This incredibly fine lamination requires very quiet, low energy conditions.” Exactly the opposite of a megaflood. Final results have not been published yet, but Flecker reports also that they found no salt layer and no evidence that the salinity crisis had ever touched the Alboran Sea.\n\n“The connection between the Atlantic and Mediterranean before and during the Messinian salinity crisis wasn’t through Gibraltar,” she concludes.\n\nHow can this be? “A feature that you must take into account, and nearly nobody does, is that the present physiography of the Mediterranean is very different from the Messinian one,” says Booth Rea. “Large basins have opened since, like the Tyrrhenian; other regions have emerged, like Sicily.” One possibility, he suggested, is that the gateway was somewhere to the east, through a volcanic arc of islands that once connected Africa to the Balearic Islands. Other possibilities include channels through Spain or Morocco, which are above sea level now but were underwater as recently as 7 million years ago.\n\nRegardless of how it happened, this modern view of the story holds lessons: It emphasizes the power not of dramatic events but of small changes. “Salt giants” — that is, massive salt deposits like the one underneath the Mediterranean — have formed at other times in Earth’s history, when basins were trapped between two tectonic plates. Their effects on climate and biodiversity have likely been huge: In this event, 89 percent of exclusively Mediterranean marine species died out.\n\nAnd a slight shallowing of the Strait of Gibraltar (or whatever the true gateway was) might be all that was needed to trigger these vast changes. “In some sense, this is more terrifying,” says Manzi, because it shows that “you can reach extreme conditions without extreme events.”\n\nTAKE A DEEPER DIVE\r| Explore Related Scholarly Articles\n\nThe authors examine the pros and cons of various theories, and present their own contrarian viewpoint, about what happened during the period from 5.97 to 5.33 million years ago, when the Mediterranean Sea allegedly became a desert.",

    "description": "A step-by-step guide on how to automatically create pull requests from your GitHub issues using GitAuto.",
    "fullText": "Already have GitAuto installed? Great! If not, you can install it directly from GitHub Marketplace or check out our detailed installation guide.\n\nNeed more details? Read on for a detailed step-by-step guide below.\n\nFirst, let's create a new GitHub issue. Look for the \"Issues\" tab in your repository:\n\nIf you don't see it, you'll need to enable issues in your repository settings first (they're disabled by default):\n\nOnce you click the Issues tab, you'll see the issues list:\n\nClick the green \"New issue\" button:\n\nYou'll see the issue creation form:\n\nDon't overthink your first issue! While you can use existing issues (we'll cover that later), let's start fresh. For your first try, a simple title is enough. Need ideas? Here's an example: \"Add a folder structure to README.md\"\n\nClick \"Create issue\" and you're done!\n\nPro tip: If you have specific requirements in mind, adding them to the description will improve accuracy. But don't worry if you don't - GitAuto can work with just a title, and you can always refine requirements after seeing the initial pull request.\n\nOnce you create your issue, GitAuto will automatically comment on it. You'll see something like this:\n\nTo assign the issue to GitAuto, simply check the checkbox in its comment. Why this approach? While GitHub issues have an assignee field, it can't accept GitHub Apps as assignees, so we use this checkbox method instead.\n\nFor existing issues that don't have GitAuto's comment, simply add the gitauto label to the issue. The first time you do this, you'll need to create the label by typing \"gitauto\" manually. After that, the label will be available in your repository's label list, and you can find it quickly by typing part of the word like \"git\" in the label field.\n\nThis labeling approach is particularly useful for bulk assignments - you can label multiple issues at once to assign them to GitAuto!\n\nGitHub recently released sub-issues, a feature that was previously missing and made GitHub Issues less convenient compared to other issue platforms like Jira, as you couldn't create parent-child issue relationships. This limitation has now been resolved, and GitAuto can be assigned to these sub-issues as well!\n\nWhile GitAuto is working, it'll keep you updated on its progress. Here's what's happening behind the scenes:\n\nLet's see this process in action:\n\nWhen the process is complete, GitAuto will comment on your issue with a link to the new pull request:\n\nClick through to the pull request to review the changes. You'll see GitAuto's proposed modifications, complete with:\n\nReview the changes and if they look good, go ahead and merge!\n\nIf not, you have several options:\n\nMajor Changes Needed? Add your requirements to the original issue's description and reassign GitAuto:\n\nFor example, in our \"Add folder structure to README.md\" case, you might realize: \"Actually, we only need the root-level or main-level structure, not every single file. That would be overkill.\" While the model might handle this intuitively, it's a specific requirement worth adding to ensure the right level of detail. If you want certainty, it's better to make such requirements explicit.\n\nMinor Tweaks? Just leave review comments like you would for any human engineer:\n\nFor example, in our case, you might notice that the added \"4. Folder Structure\" h2 heading is too close to the text above - missing one blank line. While this kind of spacing issue might be slightly irritating, let's use it as a chance to practice the review comment workflow.\n\nClick the blue \"+\" button that appears when you hover over line numbers to add a review comment:\n\nWrite your comment explaining what needs to be changed:\n\nSubmit your review as \"Request Changes\":\n\nNo need to mention GitAuto specifically - it will automatically receive notifications for any review comments on its pull requests and start working on the changes:\n\nAnd here's the result - a properly spaced heading with an added blank line:\n\nAs of writing, GitAuto offers several pricing tiers:\n\nImportant notes about credit usage:\n\nYou can check your remaining issue count by creating a new issue (e.g., creating a test issue).\n\nNow that you know how to use GitAuto with GitHub issues, why not try it out? Start with something simple - maybe that documentation update you've been putting off? Let GitAuto handle the initial PR while you focus on more complex tasks.\n\nHow many open GitHub issues do you have right now (A)? And how many issues did your team close this month/last month (B)? Using a simple formula:\n\nA/B = Estimated months to close all current issues\n\nThis quick calculation can give you a reality check on your issue backlog. Let's look at a real-world example:\n\nMicrosoft's VSCode, one of the most popular open-source repositories, has 8,262 open issues:\n\nIn the last three months (Oct-Dec 2024), they closed 5,656 issues (excluding PRs), averaging about 1,885 issues per month (using the GitHub query is:issue closed:2024-10-01..2024-12-31 -is:pr):\n\nUsing our formula: 8,262 / 1,885 = 4.4 months. This means if you filed an issue today and joined the end of the queue (assuming no queue-jumping), you'd theoretically wait about 4.4 months for your issue to be addressed. Try calculating this number for your repository - is the result acceptable for your team and users? If this number is higher than you (or your boss) would like, it might be time to consider adding resources.\n\nHave questions or need help?

    "description": "A foundational role-playing game engine designed for humans, computers, and everything in between.",
    "fullText": "The Tactical Dice Game System (TDGS) is an open-source RPG engine released under the MIT license. It's not a complete game: it's the mechanical foundation for building them. TDGS provides mathematically transparent rules designed for computational verification, making it ideal for indie developers, AI-powered tools, and anyone who wants to build on tested mathematics rather than reinvent probability.\n\nAll contested actions resolve with one formula: d20 + (Your Stat − Their Stat) + Modifiers >= 11. The threshold is always 11; stat differences and modifiers do the rest. This scales cleanly from bar brawls to divine conflicts without table lookups or variable DCs. TDGS also introduces Luck as a permanent attribute rather than a spendable re\n\nTDGS gives you the engine: resolution mechanics, nine attributes, unified progression, and combat rules with consistent lethality across all power tiers. It doesn't give you setting, monsters, or adventures. You build the game.\n\nTDGS is designed from the ground up to serve three audiences equally: humans at tables rolling physical dice, computers and software running deterministic simulations, and artificial intelligence that can learn, run, and assist with games. Every mechanic is transparent, every formula is explicit, and every document has an AI-optimized companion.\n\nThe foundational design philosophy of TDGS. Why it exists, what it believes, and the immutable features that define the system. Start here.\n\nHow TDGS is organized and how to speak its language. Project architecture, terminology standards, contribution guidelines, and the three constituencies TDGS serves.\n\nHow uncertainty is resolved in TDGS. Dice taxonomy, resolution vs magnitude, critical outcomes, and when to roll.\n\nThe nine foundational attributes: STR, DEX, REF, CON, MOV, INT, WIS, CHA, and LUK. What they measure and what they don't.\n\nThe core formula for resolving uncertain actions. One formula, one threshold, infinite possibilities. Natural extremes, stat pairings, and critical outcomes.\n\nThe attribute that bends reality. Intentionally unfair, deliberately powerful, carefully constrained. How luck sets floors and ceilings on probability.\n\nWhat you can do, and what it costs. Physical, Mental, Magical, Utility, and Defensive actions with optional Technology and Psionics expansions.\n\nWhen you act, how often, and in what order. Scenes, Rounds, Initiative, Instants, and Interrupts.\n\nWhat you can do beyond your innate capabilities. Skills, Spells, and Traits: the three types of abilities and how they work.\n\nHow damage is dealt, absorbed, and survived. Hit Points, damage calculation, armor systems, healing, and conditions.\n\nWhat things ARE in the game world. The universal structure for player characters, NPCs, creatures, and anything that can act.\n\nWhat you've become through training. How classes grant abilities, unlock tiers, and provide stat bonuses. Template classes included.\n\nWhat you ARE, inherently. Stat ranges, natural weapons and armor, innate traits. Template races from Goblin to Dragon.\n\nHow you grow and advance. XP system, the Difficulty Spectrum, leveling costs, stat increases, and the Legend Wall.\n\nBuilding a character from scratch. The seven-step process for creating TDGS characters: Race, Stats, Luck, Class, Bonuses, Derived Values, and Finishing Touches.\n\nSpatial mechanics for tactical play. Distance systems (grid and range bands), movement actions, terrain types, cover, opportunity attacks, flanking, and forced movement.\n\nWhat you wear, wield, and carry. Slot types, equipped vs carried, item structure, carrying capacity, and slot management.\n\nHow AoE works in TDGS. Distance measurement (Chebyshev), standard shapes (circle, cone, line, rectangle), notation, height, origin, and resolution.\n\nDamage Types as a framework. Resistance (75% cap), Vulnerability (no cap), Immunity (the sole exception to minimum damage), Absorption, and the Damage Pipeline.\n\nRules for mounts (creatures you ride) and vehicles (conveyances you operate). Covers creation, progression, action economy, combat, and traits.\n\nRules for creating items. Skill-based quality pools, batch crafting, recipes, and the relationship between crafting and XP.\n\nRules for armies and warfare. Units as entities, commanders, orders, morale cascades, routing, and rally mechanics.\n\nCanonical definitions for all TDGS terminology. When a term appears in any document, its authoritative meaning is defined here with links to source documents.",

    "description": "Joanelle Cobos was laid off by Amazon in October, her fourth layoff. Planning ahead gave her time to reset, but financial pressure is now mounting.",
    "fullText": "Joanelle Cobos began actively job hunting in January after being laid off by Amazon in October.\n\nAfter three prior layoffs, she'd prepared financially for a fourth — which came at Amazon.\n\nThe financial cushion let her relax after the layoff, but the pressure is now setting in.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Joanelle Cobos, a 38-year-old job seeker who lives in Las Vegas. She previously worked for Amazon as a design manager until being laid off last October. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nLast October, I was getting ready to head to the office when I noticed two text messages from Amazon that looked like spam, asking me to click a link or check my email. I soon learned that after nearly four years with the company, I'd been laid off — my third layoff since 2019 and the fourth in my career.\n\nSince I'd dealt with job losses so many times, I don't think this layoff affected me emotionally as much as it did some of my coworkers. The idea of having so much free time ahead of me was exciting.\n\nNow, my job search feels like a ticking time bomb, but I'm not in a rush to jump into another large corporation.\n\nBusiness Insider is speaking with workers who've found themselves at a corporate crossroads — whether due to a layoff, resignation, job search, or shifting workplace expectations.\n\nShare your story by filling out this form, contacting this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com, or via Signal at jzinkula.29.\n\nAfter dealing with nine months of unemployment during my previous layoff, I'd started planning my life around the possibility of losing my job.\n\nI was also preparing to be laid off at Amazon, because my tenure had been plagued by whispers of voluntary resignation programs and job cuts, basically once a year. My job never felt particularly secure.\n\nBecause of the financial cushion I'd built, the paychecks I would receive from Amazon during my continuation period, the severance that followed, and my experience dealing with layoffs before, I didn't feel immediate financial pressure.\n\nRather than jump into the job hunt, I decided to take a pause from October through the end of the year. This time period felt a little like a paid vacation, and given that it overlapped with the holidays, it was almost the perfect time to get laid off.\n\nThen January came. I'd done some research in the prior months to help inform my next career move, but I knew I'd have to ramp up my job search.\n\nI've started actively applying for jobs — including creative project management and creative operations management roles — but I haven't had much success landing interviews yet. I'm not too stressed for now, but I know my paychecks and severance won't last forever; I'll eventually need additional income to stay afloat financially. Accounting for my severance and emergency fund, I have about 10 to 12 months before I run out of funds.\n\nI've had a hard time staying employed at large corporations for any extended period of time. I've been either laid off or left because the pay and benefits weren't good enough. For now, I'm targeting roles at smaller companies that may not be able to pay as much as a larger company, but where I wouldn't feel like just a \"number\" and the job security might be better.\n\nSmaller companies might also offer more work-from-home flexibility. Prior to the layoff, I'd been required to work from the office five days a week, which was about 45-to-50 minutes each way of commuting. I was still the only one in my office on my team, so there was no in-person collaboration for me to benefit from.\n\nI'd like to take a lower-stress, lower-paying job with good health benefits and bridge the financial gap with income from my own business, though I'm not sure what this would be yet. If my job search drags on, I'd be open to exploring more freelance and contract roles.\n\nAfter my previous layoff, I landed a job at Amazon in part because I had a relative who worked there. I doubt my résumé would have been seen without an employee referral. I'm still looking for my break this time around.\n\nTo boost my chances, I've been using generative AI tools to help with résumés, cover letters, and identifying roles I might be qualified for. It's made the job search far less stressful. What used to take a full day now takes just a few hours.\n\nI have two main pieces of advice for others who have been laid off, including other affected Amazon employees. First, take the time to be upset, but don't stay in that headspace too long because that doesn't help you. Layoffs aren't personal — they're a business decision.\n\nSecond, before looking for a new job that is very similar to your prior role, consider whether it's the best fit for you. If you can swing it financially, take some time to think about where you want to go and what you want to do.\n\nWhile job searching can be frustrating, it's also given me the opportunity to reexamine what I want in my career. If there's anything good that's come from the layoff, it's that it's forced me to take time to reflect.",

In recent years, Alphabet has made significant strides in AI, launching Gemini 3 in 2025 as its most advanced model yet, requiring less prompting and delivering smarter responses.\n\nOther advances include the Ironwood AI chip (its seventh-generation TPU) for scaling large models, Gemma 3 for efficient open-source AI, SIMA 2 for AI agents in 3D worlds, and integrations like AI Mode in Search and Gemini Robotics for physical interactions. These innovations bolster its cloud and ad businesses amid the AI boom.\n\nAlphabet's stock is up 1% year-to-date (YTD), just slightly underperforming the S&P 500's ($SPX) 1.89% YTD gain, but over the past year, GOOGL has surged 69%, far exceeding the index's 15% return. Valuation metrics show a trailing P/E of 30.65, a forward P/E of 29.64, and a price/sales of 9.93. Compared to its 10-year historical average P/E of 27.69, it currently trades 7% higher, suggesting a premium.

    "fullText": "The YouTube gaming star’s weird and divisive adaptation of his obscure horror film is a game within a film about a game – and hints at new directions for storytelling\n\nDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? \nSomething weird struck me early on while watching the movie Iron Lung, which has so far taken $32m at the box office, despite being a grungy low-budget sci-fi thriller adapted from an independent video game few people outside of the horror gaming community have even heard of. Set after a galactic apocalypse, it follows a convict who must buy his freedom by piloting a rusty submarine through an ocean of human blood on a distant planet. Ostensibly, he’s looking for relics that may prove vital for scientific research, but what he finds is much more ghastly. So far, so strange.\n\nThe film was also written, directed and financed by one person – the YouTube gaming superstar Mark “Markiplier” Fischbach – who also stars. But that’s not the weird part, either. The weird part is that watching the film Iron Lung feels like watching Fischbach play Iron Lung the game. Maybe it’s the fact that he spends most of the movie sitting at the sub’s controls, trying to figure out how to use them correctly – like a gamer would. Maybe it’s that, as the film progresses, he has to solve a series of environmental puzzles linked by various codes, computer read-outs and little injections of narrative – just like in a video game. Long periods of the movie involve Fischbach trying to decide what to do next, the camera close up on his confused face. This is incredibly similar to watching his YouTube videos about playing Iron Lung, an experience he often found bewildering. It was the most metatextual experience I’ve had in the cinema since The Truman Show – but I’m not sure this is what Fischbach intended.\n\nOf course, there have been plenty of movies in which a character must escape an enclosed environment by solving a series of puzzles. It’s a whole subgenre of fun thrillers, from the Saw franchise to Buried to Fall. But the highly procedural nature of Iron Lung, the long sequences of pondering, the tools the character uses and the way that puzzles dovetail into each other to open new possibilities? That’s video gameplay. Even the way the backstory is revealed, via short, oblique flashbacks, is exactly how a game would use cinematic cutscenes to flesh out the universe. This is not a film of a game, it is a film of the experience of a game – a sort of narrativised YouTube playthrough. I almost expected a comments section to appear instead of the closing credits.\n\nIron Lung isn’t the only YouTube video sensation to be converted into linear media. The hugely successful Dungeons and Dragons YouTube channel, Critical Role, is now an animated TV series. Elsewhere, Adventure Time and Rick and Morty started on the web before they were transferred to TV (and then became games), and theatre has been experimenting with interactive immersive productions for a decade or two. There’s now a growing range of TV shows morphing into video podcasts (the new Harry Hill series, for example), and video podcasts morphing into TV. We now live in an age of hybridised entertainment experiences and as viewers we’re going to have to renegotiate our relationships with traditional media as a result.\n\nRemember the controversy over how audiences were shouting out catchphrases and throwing popcorn during A Minecraft Movie? What they were doing was re-enacting the para-social experience of playing and/or watching Minecraft on a computer screen – but in a cinema. The auditorium became a physical equivalent of the Twitch/YouTube chat window, with the spectators participating in meme-like jokes. While watching Iron Lung, the teenagers behind me were pointing out tropes and Easter eggs that referenced Fischbach’s YouTube videos as well as the original game, like a sort of ontological hall of mirrors.\n\nIron Lung can be enjoyed as an oblique and claustrophobic B-movie. Comparisons have been made with John Carpenter’s anarchic Dark Star, although I see a closer analogue in the cult sci-fi thriller ​​Hardware, in which a self-assembling killer robot terrorises a woman in her apartment. But beneath the familiar trappings of the contained thriller, Iron Lung’s origins as a game are also written into the experience, there for those in the know who are prepared to unpick the self-reflexive strands.\n\nWhatever you make of Iron Lung, I’m sure we’ll see more YouTubers migrating into film. I just hope it in no way leads to a Jake Paul-directed Rocky movie.\n\nHere is a game for those who want a role-playing adventure that won’t take 120 hours to complete or bombard you with dark, Tolkienesque lore. I’ve only just started playing Hermit and Pig, but I’m already charmed by it – an unlikely yet cosy cross between Thank Goodness You’re Here! and the Nicolas Cage movie Pig, set in a beautifully drawn, hyper-colourful world.\n\nHermit is a lonely guy wandering the forest with his truffle-sniffing pet, until the two are drawn into a drama involving an evil corporation. There are puzzles to solve and sub-quests to tackle, all of it lovingly critiquing RPG conventions, such as turn-based combat and a levelling up system. The narrative centres Hermit’s social awkwardness in a gentle and respectful way, and the visual style will remind you of your favourite offbeat cartoons and webcomics.\n\nAvailable on: PC, Mac\n\n Estimated playtime: eight hours\n\nBarely a month after launch, Riot Games is laying off as many as 80 staff from 2XKO, a fighting game based in the League of Legends universe. “Overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term,” said executive producer Tom Cannon. The game secured positive reviews for its pacy combat and exuberant visual style, but the fighting game scene is crowded, and even a potential user base of 100 million League of Legends fans wasn’t enough to secure large-scale curiosity.\n\nIn December, Fifa announced that its major new football sim would be coming in 2026, via a publishing deal with Netflix. The developer was named as the relatively unknown Delphi Interactive, and GamesIndustry.Biz has an interesting interview with its founders about how new models are needed to succeed in an ever-evolving market. Personally, I think the important part is making a footie game as good as EA Sports FC, but I’m no CEO.\n\nOn the subject of Electronic Arts, the company has kept its Sims brand going for more 20 years, and the latest add-on, Royalty & Legacy, shows why. It allows you to rule your own regal dynasty over multiple generations, bringing a note of epic grandeur to the usual gameplay recipe of building a nice house and then trying to stop the inhabitants accidentally burning it down. Writing for Eurogamer, Matt Wales explains why Sims fans just can’t wait to be king. Or queen.\n\nAnd Pushing Buttons regulars, do listen to our games editor, Keza, speaking about her new book, Super Nintendo, which explores the game-changing company, on the New York Times’s Book Review podcast.\n\n‘Disturbing’: Australian government demands review of Roblox’s PG rating after reports of child grooming\n\nHow a decades-old video game has helped me defeat the doomscroll\n\n‘Christian pastors declared Pikachu to be a demon’: how Pokémon went from moral panic to unifying global hit\n\nMewgenics – infinite ways to skin a cat | ★★★★☆\n\nRomeo Is a Dead Man – a misfire from a storied gaming provocateur | ★★☆☆☆\n\nThis week’s question, from reader James R, seeks to get a hoary old video game debate going again:\n\n“A few years ago everyone was asking, ‘What is the Citizen Kane of video games’?, but it seems no one is talking about that any more. Have we already had the Citizen Kane of video games? Did I miss it? If so, what was it?”\n\nThis long-running debate seemed to reach peak interest in the late-2000s and early 2010s, when innovative, highly cinematic titles such as Bioshock, Red Dead Redemption and Deus Ex were expanding the narrative and emotional scope of games with dazzling new techniques. At that time every games site on the internet had its own “What is the Citizen Kane of video games?” article. IGN, for example, declared that Nintendo’s sci-fi adventure Metroid Prime fit the bill, because, like the Orson Welles film, it used a huge variety of genre tropes and technical tricks to achieve its ambitious aims. Even at the time, most people disagreed, but well done IGN for having a go. \n\n I think the debate died out because it sunk into self-parody – it represented the reflexive anxiety of a growing medium still living under cinema’s cultural shadow. Ten years later, we’re more comfortable with the understanding that not everything that happens in video games has to be analogous to the history of film. There are games as formally daring as Citizen Kane (The Stanley Project, Disco Elysium, Shadow of the Colossus) and there are games that tell stories with myriad narrative strands (The Last of Us, Life Is Strange, Mass Effect). But the whole package? Possibly not. Ultimately, I think the answer to your question is that it doesn’t matter. Games do different things from films and comparing them in this way doesn’t actually achieve anything. Having said that, the real answer is Shenmue.\n\nIf you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.",

    "description": "Parents who owe a significant amount of child support soon could lose their ability to travel internationally as the Trump administration expands and steps up enforcement of a 30-year-old law that all...",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Parents who owe a significant amount of child support soon could lose their ability to travel internationally as the Trump administration expands and steps up enforcement of a 30-year-old law that allows the federal government to revoke American passports until payments are made, three U.S. officials told The Associated Press.\n\nWhile passport revocations for unpaid child support of more than $2,500 have been permitted under 1996 federal legislation, the State Department had in the past acted only when someone applied to renew their travel document or sought other consular services. In other words, enforcement depended on the person approaching the department for assistance.\n\nStarting soon, however, the department will begin to revoke passports on its own initiative based on data shared with it by the Health and Human Services Department, according to the U.S. officials familiar with the plan. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the change has not yet been publicly announced.\n\nThe number of people who could be affected was not immediately clear, but it is believed to be in the thousands. Because of the potentially large universe of those owing child support who currently hold passports, the State Department will make the change in tiers, the officials said.\n\nThe first group to be affected will be passport holders who owe more than $100,000 in past-due child support, the officials said. One of the officials said fewer than 500 people meet that threshold and could avoid having their passport revoked if they enter into a payment plan with HHS after being notified of the pending revocation.\n\nThe official acknowledged, though, that if and when the threshold is lowered to a smaller past-due amount, the number of those affected will rise significantly. The official could not say when any further changes would take effect or estimate how many people might then lose their passports.\n\nIn an emailed response to the AP's queries about the change, the State Department said it \"is reviewing options to enforce long-standing law to prevent those owing substantial amounts of child support from neglecting their legal and moral obligations to their children.” It added: “It is simple: deadbeat parents need to pay their child support arrears.”\n\nSince the Passport Denial Program began with the 1996 passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, the initiative has taken in nearly $621 million in past-due child support payments, with nine collections of more than $300,000, according to the Office of Child Support Enforcement at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nHHS did not respond to questions about how many people are in arrears.",

    "fullText": "Feb 10 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy assembled his top military officers on Tuesday to discuss shortcomings in air defence and other aspects of protecting civilians ‌from attack nearly four years into Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nZelenskiy, speaking in his ‌nightly video address, also assessed how local authorities in Ukraine's cities were tackling the aftermath of massive Russian ​attacks, particularly in ensuring high-rise apartments had power and heating. He again singled out for criticism officials in the capital Kyiv.\n\nZelenskiy said he held long discussions with the military's Commander-in-Chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, the chief of the general staff, Andrii Hnatov, and Defence Minister Mykhailo Fedorov.\n\n\"Many changes are ‌happening right now in the ⁠work of air defence. In some regions, the way teams operate, interceptors, mobile fire units, the entire small air defence component is being practically ⁠rebuilt completely,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\n\"But this is only one element of defence that requires changes. Changes will happen.\"\n\nThe president has frequently pointed to improved air defences as critical to protecting ​cities from ​air attacks and has asked Kyiv's Western allies ​to provide more weaponry to knock ‌out incoming missiles and drones.\n\nLast week, with heating still not restored to hundreds of dwellings after air raids targeting energy infrastructure, he said defence lines in some areas were proving inefficient.\n\nEnergy Minister Denys Shmyhal, writing on Telegram after the daily meeting of officials on energy issues, said crews were working around the clock to restore heating in Kyiv, where night-time ‌temperatures were set to hit -19 Celsius (-2 Fahrenheit).\n\nAfter meeting with ​the top brass, Zelenskiy said Kharkiv and Poltava regions ​in central and northeastern Ukraine were ​also having difficulties with electricity, as well as parts of Odesa ‌region on the Black Sea.\n\nHe renewed criticism ​of decision-makers in Kyiv, ​where he has been at odds with Mayor Vitali Klitschko, as well as in his hometown of Kryvyi Rih and Okhtyrka near the Russian border.\n\n\"Every community leader and ​responsible service must pay real ‌attention to what is happening with buildings, with networks,\" he said. \"We are monitoring ​at all levels and people will be held personally responsible.\"",

    "fullText": "We started CoLoop in 2020 while still at university. We survived multiple cofounder breakups and all sorts of other near-death experiences. Despite that we built our first product to $1M ARR… and then killed it after realising the opportunity was too small and we didn't have real PMF. We spent six months pivoting, and through that process came to understand just how important customer research is to finding a winning strategy. So we built a product to make it faster, cheaper, and better.\n\nWe don't tell you this because we think suffering is something to aspire to. We tell you because if you're an ex-founder evaluating whether to work for someone else, you should know who you'd be working for. We are not going to sell early, get comfortable, or lose interest. This is everything to us.\n\nWe also take seriously that you're trusting us with your time. Three people who've worked at CoLoop have gone on to become YC founders. When you're here, we'll share everything we know and everything we learn along the way. All we ask is total commitment. And if you eventually get the itch to build your own thing again, we will back you 100%.\n\nWe're looking for ex-founders who want to write code, ship product, and work on hard problems in agentic AI.\n\nAt CoLoop, engineers own the full cycle. There are no product managers. You gather context, decide what to build, build it, launch it, measure the impact, and iterate. We track individual attribution in PostHog. One engineer recently drove 40 new active users through a single small growth experiment.\n\nThe structure is flat. Influence is earned through skill and context. We'd rather you make a wrong call than wait to be told what to do.\n\nWe think ex-founders tend to work well here because the expectations match how they already think: own the problem, move quickly, care about customers, and measure what matters. If you've built and run a company before, the pace and autonomy at CoLoop will feel familiar.\n\nIf you failed to find PMF, we're building the product that helps companies avoid that fate. Your experience is valued here.\n\nBonus: you've led an engineering team of 3+ people; you have experience with enterprise customers.\n\nIf you're excited about this role but don't meet every requirement, we'd still love to hear from you. If you’d like to meet the team, we host CoLoop CoWorking from our office most Saturdays!",

    "description": "Countless individuals unconnected to the protests died after Tehran cut landlines and internet access, preventing individuals from contacting emergency services, Dr. Reza told the ‘Post’.",
    "fullText": "Countless individuals unconnected to the protests died after Tehran cut landlines and internet access, preventing individuals from contacting emergency services, Dr. Reza told the ‘Post’.\n\nTheIslamic regime has carried out extrajudicial killings of injured protesters inside hospitals and arrested countless medical personnel suspected of treating those wounded by Tehran, an Iranian doctor told The Jerusalem Post on Tuesday.\n\nMedical facilities and schools have been used by regime forces to locate, identify, and arrest individuals who joined the protests demonstrating against the country’s worsening economic crisis, said Dr. R, a member of the Aida Health Alliance whose name is being withheld for security reasons.\n\nIn the hospitals, many of those who were being treated for injuries were found lying in their treatment beds, still attached to machines, with bullet holes in their heads, Dr. R said, accusing the regime of murdering those wounded and lying about the circumstances surrounding the casualty.\n\n“If the patient already had the shot in the head [when they arrived at the hospital], nobody would put the tube or catheter in because they're already dead….,” they explained. “So it means they went into the hospital and they killed them on the treatment bed.”\n\nDr. R shared photographs showing bodies in black bags with bullet wounds to the head, surrounded by fresh blood and still connected to medical tubes and catheters.\n\nThe Post has not been able to independently verify the authenticity of the images, though they are consistent with accounts published by multiple Iranian human rights organizations, including Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO), and dissident channels.\n\nMahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, IHRNGO Director, published, “The testimonies of doctors show that the Islamic Republic has trampled even the most basic human and medical principles and has systematically used hospitals as instruments of repression and killing. The deliberate shutdown of ventilators, the prevention of treatment for the injured, and the arrest of patients from hospital beds constitute crimes against humanity and demonstrate the complete collapse of any ethical or legal standards in this government.”\n\nHe added, “When states use hospitals as tools of repression, this is not merely a human rights crisis but a global public-health crisis. We call on the World Health Organisation to examine reports concerning the conversion of hospitals into instruments of repression, the denial of medical care to patients, and the obstruction of medical staff from carrying out their professional duties. Such investigation is essential to protect lives now and to ensure accountability and justice in the future.”\n\nThe Islamic regime’s violations of medical facilities and its suppression of protesters have become so severe that uninvolved civilians have died as collateral damage, Dr. R warned. On January 8, when the regime cut off internet access and severely restricted landlines as part of a communications blackout, people facing medical emergencies were unable to call for help, Dr. R said.\n\n“Some people, the old people having heart attacks and the women going into labor, they couldn't call the ambulance to come and just help them,” Dr. R said. “Some people [were] dead like just that… because of not having access to call paramedics.”\n\nThe same communications shutdown that has cost an unknown number of lives has also hindered the international community from grasping the full scale of the atrocities, which the UN’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights warned has been the deadliest crackdown by the regime since the 1979 Islamic revolution.\n\nAt least 24,000 people were detained as of January 24, according to the office, including children, journalists, and human rights defenders.\n\nBeyond preventing civilians from reaching emergency services, Dr. R alleged that the regime evacuated several hospitals in the early days of the protests so that IRGC forces could receive priority treatment, putting existing patients’ health and lives at risk.\n\nMedical professionals themselves have not been spared, Dr. R added. “Many doctors have been arrested, tortured, and some have even been sentenced to death because [they were] helping injured people,” they said, noting that physicians have a moral and professional obligation to treat all wounded individuals under the Hippocratic oath.\n\n“They're still tracing the doctors. They're still trying to convict them for helping the enemy's country, or [accusing them of] espionage,” Dr. R continued, later adding that medical students have not been spared from the brutality.\n\nAfter their hospital shifts, where they are expected to report any injuries suspected of being linked to protests, medical staff are followed home by regime forces to see whether they make house calls to demonstrators, they said.\n\nThese practices have forced even those with life-threatening injuries to remain at home without medical care.\n\nRecounting one incident, they described a teenage boy who was shot in the genitals during a protest. His father, a widowed physician who knew it was unsafe to take his son to a hospital, attempted to treat him at home, but the boy ultimately died of his wounds.\n\nThe danger faced by medical facilities and personnel in Iran led to the creation of the Aida Health Alliance. The group was formed during the 2022 “Women, Life, Freedom” protests, which erupted following the regime’s killing of Mahsa Amini. It takes its name from Aida Rostami, a physician abducted and murdered by the regime’s security forces for treating protesters during the demonstrations.\n\nThe alliance was established to advocate for, educate, and support injured and traumatized individuals. This nonpartisan organization focuses on ensuring that human rights are respected in Iran by providing education and mental health consultations during times of crisis.\n\nWhile many members of the Aida Health Alliance, including Dr. R, are based in the Iranian diaspora, the group’s ability to support the injured has also been severely affected over the past month. Many of its doctors were forced to flee the country after the 2022 protests, and Dr. R said several of its physicians have been arrested in recent weeks.\n\n“You cannot believe how many patients we receive every single day that are at home. They didn't go to any doctors. They didn't even have a chance to go and get the X-ray to just address those bullets... Sometimes we just see that the bullet is [still] inside, [and] is infected,” Dr. R shared.\n\n“We cannot do anything except giving [the instruction to] go and take the antibiotics, educate them how to control the bleeding or provide them free mental health advice,” Dr. R shared, “but even for the first two weeks after that massive massacre, they (the regime) were [watching] every single pharmacy they could to see who was coming to get the tetanus shot and antibiotics…”\n\nCiting an Iran International report, based on documentation seen by the editorial board, that 36,500 people were killed from just January 8-9, Dr. R said they imagined the figure was much higher in reality and the impact would likely be felt for years to come.\n\nEveryone in the country is mourning at least three people they knew, Dr. R said, sharing that they were already aware that there had been cases of suicide. In one incident described by Dr. R, parents had committed suicide after learning their young children had been killed while demonstrating.\n\nFor many, Dr. R said, the trauma is worsened by not knowing the fate of their loved ones. The physician said they were shown at least one mass grave where unknown individuals were buried without identification.\n\nThe sheer number of unorganized body bags, “piled up on each other to the point that you cannot move your feet to just walk away,” makes it even harder for families to uncover the truth.",

    "fullText": "Police shut down DD Café in Garden Grove, Calif. after \"complaints of illegal activity\"\n\nSeventeen people, including the business owners, were arrested on Feb. 5\n\nThe arrests come days after a TikTok user described DD Café as a \"strip club\" in a viral video about the business\n\nPolice shut down a California café reportedly known for its bikini-clad employees after “complaints of illegal activity” and a viral TikTok describing it as a “strip club.”\n\nSeventeen people were arrested at DD Café on Thursday, Feb. 5 following a police investigation into the Garden Grove, Calif. establishment, the Garden Grove Police Department (GGPD) said in a Feb. 5 news release.\n\nThe department’s Special Investigations Unit conducted the investigation into DD Café “following complaints of illegal activity occurring inside the business,” the GGPD said. On Feb. 5, police served a search warrant at the establishment. Gang suppression officers were on the scene, according to the release.\n\nThe GGPD’s Sgt. Nick Jensen told The Orange County Register that police found DD Café employees serving customers while clad in bikinis, as well as in what the newspaper described as “various states of undress.”\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported that the business was operating as a “bikini cafe.” The Yelp page for the business shows photos of employees in bikinis, and lists it in business categories for “coffee & tea,” “juice bars & smoothies” and “adult entertainment.”\n\nJensen also told The Orange County Register that the business owners were among the 17 people arrested in the Feb. 5 bust.\n\nThe café violated public nudity and alcohol regulations among other Garden Grove municipal codes, the GGPD sergeant said. The business was not permitted to sell alcohol at the location, the newspaper reported, citing authorities.\n\nIn addition to the arrests, DD Café has also been red-tagged, according to police. This means the business is required to cease operations until the various violations are addressed, Jensen told The Orange County Register. The business is currently listed as closed on Google.\n\nThe owners of DD Café could not be reached for comment. A GGPD spokesperson did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.\n\nThe police investigation into and arrests comes after a video describing the Orange County establishment as a “strip club” went viral on TikTok.\n\n“So I went to a strip club today by accident, and I know what you're thinking. ‘By accident?’ No, actually, for real,” user @dosdaygirl, identified by CBS News as Paulina Abena, says in a Feb. 2 video that has amassed nearly 2 million views.\n\nAbena describes DD Café as “topless” in the TikTok, stating that she visited after searching for coffee shops in her area and finding the now-closed establishment. “They meant double D, like boobs,” she says of the business’s name. “So I walk in and everybody's naked. Quite literally, they're all naked. … I'm the only non-naked woman in the place.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nPolice have previously taken action against a “bikini café” in Garden Grove, Jensen told The Orange County Register.\n\nHe also told the newspaper that authorities believe that similar establishments are operating elsewhere in the area.",

    "description": "U.S. Vice President JD Vance’s team posted and then deleted a message on social media about the Republican’s visit to a memorial paying tribute to early 20th century Armenians killed by the Ottoman Em...",
    "fullText": "U.S. Vice President JD Vance’s team posted and then deleted a message on social media about the Republican’s visit to a memorial paying tribute to early 20th century Armenians killed by the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe issue was the post using the term “Armenian genocide,” a designation the U.S. government historically has not used for what happened, with a notable exception by the Biden administration. The White House blamed a staff mistake.\n\nHere are some questions and answers about what that means, what Vance himself did and didn’t say, and why it matters.\n\nVance visited a site called the Armenian Genocide Memorial, Armenia’s official national monument, remembering its citizens who died under the Ottoman Empire’s brutal control during World War I.\n\nThe initial post on Vance’s official X account stated that he was visiting the memorial “to honor the victims of the Armenian genocide.” It was replaced with a second post that showed what he wrote in the guest book as well as a clip of the vice president and Usha Vance laying flowers at the memorial.\n\nVance, the first U.S. vice president to visit Armenia, was in the country as part of the Trump administration's follow-up to a U.S.-brokered deal aimed at ending a decades-long conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, where Vance traveled later Tuesday.\n\n“Genocide” is a fraught and legally distinct term that national governments, international bodies and media organizations use carefully.\n\nThe United Nations in 1948 defined genocide “to mean certain acts, enumerated in Article II, committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such,” according to the U.S. State Department's long-held understanding.\n\nIt is not questioned that many thousands of Armenian citizens, most of them Christians, died at the direction of the Committee of Union and Progress that led the Muslim government in Constantinople, now known as Istanbul.\n\nThe U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum estimates that “at least 664,000 and possibly as many as 1.2 million” died.\n\nBut the U.S. government has historically not recognized what happened as a “genocide” out of fear of alienating Turkey, a key U.S. ally in the region. In 2021, then-President Joe Biden formally recognized that the systematic killings and deportations of hundreds of thousands of Armenians by Ottoman Empire forces were a part of a “genocide.”\n\nTurkey reacted with fury at the time. The foreign minister said his country “will not be given lessons on our history from anyone.”\n\nPeople of Armenian descent recall the victims with memorials and an annual day of remembrance observed around the world, including in the U.S.\n\nVance was asked specifically on Tuesday about his visit to the memorial and whether he was “recognizing” genocide.\n\nHe avoided using the word and said he went to “pay my respects” at the invitation of his host, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, and his government.\n\n“They said this is a very important site for us, and obviously I’m the first (U.S.) vice president to ever visit Armenia,” Vance said. “They asked us to visit the site. Obviously, it’s a very terrible thing that happened a little over a hundred years ago and something that’s very, very important to them culturally.”\n\nVance added that it was “a sign of respect, both for the victims but also for the Armenian government that’s been a very important partner for us in the region.”\n\nThe White House blamed the original post on a staff member. It’s the second time in less than a week that the West Wing has blamed an unnamed aide for a controversy over a social media post. Last Friday, it was a racist video that Trump had shared on his Truth Social account that depicted former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama as jungle primates.\n\nThe White House defended that post initially before deleting it after a cascade of criticism.\n\nIt’s not yet clear whether there will be any diplomatic consequences. Vance, for his part, seemed determined to keep the focus on the original mission of his trip.\n\n“I think the president struck a great peace deal. I think the administration is really making it stick,” Vance said.\n\nStill, there is the political question of whether Armenian Americans react, with the rhetorical boomerang offering one more reminder of how reluctant the U.S. has been to use the word “genocide” to describe what Armenians remember that way.\n\nThis story has been updated to delete a reference saying Istanbul is Turkey’s capital. Ankara is the capital. ___ White House reporter Michelle Price contributed reporting from Baku, Azerbaijan.",

    "description": "Of the 240 financial services CEO that EY surveyed, more than half said AI investments have shown results faster than expected.",
    "fullText": "Banks' analyst classes probably won't swap fresh-faced college grads for bots — at least not this year.\n\nSome 60% of the 240 financial services CEOs that EY surveyed for its Quarterly CEO Outlook Survey said they think investing in AI will maintain or even increase their current head count in 2026. Only 28% of those surveyed predicted head count would drop this year.\n\nLeaders at some of the biggest banks, including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, have said that they're resisting hiring growth where it makes sense to prioritize efficiency. They, along with some other bulge-bracket leads, have predicted that AI could grow head count in the long run, though. Still, some roles are becoming obsolete: Citi CEO Jane Fraser said in a recent internal memo that some jobs \"will no longer be required\" as AI advances.\n\nFor their part, the financial services CEOs that EY surveyed are similarly bullish about AI's capacity to transform the workplace, and nearly half see AI and digital investment as the most important factor in their companies' ability to thrive and adapt this year.\n\nAround a quarter said their AI initiatives have significantly beaten expectations, and 57% said they've shown results faster than expected. Just more than half said they expect the biggest transformations to come from generative AI.\n\nWhen it comes to hiring for AI talent — itself a highly competitive market — 87% of CEOs in EY's survey are optimistic about their ability to attract and keep talent in 2026. The question of returns on the AI investment, for talent and in general, also seems top of mind for the financial services leaders. Seventy-six percent of boards in the survey said they'll review transformation ROI metrics as often as financial results.\n\nFirms of all sizes are being asked to justify their AI spends, as analysts and investors begin to wonder whether the sometimes billion-dollar bets will show up on balance sheets.",

    "description": "A new report from Covista found that hospital leaders are struggling to find enough staff, especially for preventive care.",
    "fullText": "Hiring in Corporate America may be sluggish, but hospitals are scrambling for talent.\n\nIt's a rare bright spot in a jobs landscape with limited openings, widespread hiring freezes, and an increasingly frustrated workforce.\n\nIt also presents a major challenge for the medical field. For patients, it means longer waits at the doctor's office and appointment headaches. For clinics, it means they can see fewer patients, jeopardizing their bottom line.\n\nA new report from the healthcare education platform Covista found that hospital leaders are falling noticeably short in filling positions across the US — especially in roles people seek out most, such as primary care.\n\n\"We're looking at dramatic shortages as we move forward for nurses, physicians, and allied health professionals,\" Steve Beard, chair and CEO of Covista, told Business Insider.\n\nHealthcare is among the few sectors of the job market that are actively growing. Over 702,000 healthcare job vacancies are posted each month, with only 306,000 unemployed workers nationwide available to fill them, according to a February report from Covista and Gallup. Researchers surveyed 1,347 clinicians and 167 healthcare executives across all 50 states.\n\nIt's a challenge unlikely to be resolved anytime soon. The National Center for Health Workforce Analysis predicts the US workforce will be short thousands of workers every year over the next decade. In 2026, America needs more than 1 million medical professionals, but only about 960,000 are actively employed in the field. Demand will balloon as baby boomers age and need short- or long-term care.\n\nBeard said that primary care providers and specialists, the \"linchpin\" of preventive medicine, are the most difficult positions for clinics to fill. Demand for allied health providers — including ultrasound techs, lab techs, radiologists, and similar roles — also far exceeds supply.\n\nThis is especially true in less populated areas: 85% of rural healthcare executives surveyed by Covista said they can't find enough local talent, while only 45% reported the same challenge in cities. And, because healthcare is such a fast-moving, hands-on job, few of those surveyed felt that AI is tangibly alleviating staff shortages.\n\n\"​​There's just no substitute for the role that human beings play in helping people heal, recover and grow,\" Beard said. He added that healthcare workers \"aren't fungible. They are critically important to what the experience is for all Americans who rely on the US healthcare system.\"\n\nWorker shortages are also part of a bigger problem facing America's hospitals. Dwindling funding, federal changes to Medicaid, and shrinking small-town populations have led to the closure of hundreds of hospitals since 2010. The majority of those are in rural areas, with nearly 800 more rural hospitals currently at risk of closure due to financial challenges.\n\nOthers that remain open have stopped inpatient care, limiting critical access to emergency rooms, labor and delivery units, and mental health support — medical specialties that can require round-the-clock staffing. In an intensive care unit, for example, at least one nurse must be on shift for every two patients.\n\nThere may still be good news for hospital hiring managers: Enrollment in US medical schools grew last year, and nursing school enrollment is rebounding from a dip in 2022. Though Beard said that it will take time to build up that workforce in rural areas, and incentivize them to stay there.\n\n\"An important part of the solution here is that we can actually train clinical talent in the markets where they live and work,\" he said.",

    "description": "The tech giant's internal policy promotes an in-house tool called Kiro over Anthropic's Claude Code. Some Amazon engineers are unhappy about this.",
    "fullText": "Amazon is one of Anthropic's largest investors and a key partner in bringing the startup's AI models and products to customers.\n\nInside Amazon, however, employees aren't allowed to use Anthropic's Claude Code for production work or for live products without formal approval.\n\nThat disconnect became more visible late last year, when Amazon rolled out internal guidance steering teams toward Kiro, its in-house AI coding assistant, according to internal messages seen by Business Insider. The guidance encourages using Kiro over non-approved third-party tools, including Claude Code, for production code.\n\nThe policy prompted criticism across internal Amazon forums. In one discussion thread, roughly 1,500 Amazon employees endorsed the formal adoption of Claude Code, according to the messages.\n\nThe restrictions have been particularly awkward for engineers who help sell AWS Bedrock, Amazon's platform that offers customers access to third-party AI services, including Claude Code. Some questioned how they could credibly promote a product they are not permitted to use themselves in official work.\n\n\"Customers will ask why they should trust or use a tool that we did not approve for internal use,\" one employee wrote.\n\nThe episode highlights the complexity of Amazon's relationship with Anthropic. While Amazon is racing to build and promote its own AI tools, it is also marketing a partner's competing technology. Amazon is one of Anthropic's largest investors, with a stake valued at more than $60 billion. Anthropic, in turn, is a major AWS customer, committing to use Amazon's cloud services and at least one million of Amazon's Trainium chips.\n\n\"We are seeing incredible improvements in efficiency and delivery from Kiro, our customer growth is rapidly accelerating, and we want to make sure our internal employees all take advantage of this capability to deliver faster for our customers,\" an Amazon spokesperson said. \"While we continue to support existing tools in use today, we do not plan to support additional, third-party AI development tools.\"\n\nAmazon maintains \"a strong strategic partnership with Anthropic,\" and while there's no explicit ban on Claude Code, the company applies \"stricter requirements for the tools used to develop production code specifically,\" the spokesperson said, noting that Amazon provides a process for seeking exceptions.\n\nAn Anthropic spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn one of the internal forums, an Amazon sales engineer flagged the irony of being asked to sell Claude Code even though it isn't formally supported inside the company. The employee wrote that they need to be able to \"use, demo, and build\" with Claude Code to support Amazon's directive to get more customers to use it through AWS Bedrock.\n\nOther Amazon engineers also debated whether the emphasis on Kiro was hindering productivity. Some argued that Claude Code outperformed Amazon's in-house tool and warned that forcing adoption of a weaker product could slow development.\n\n\"A tool that can't keep pace with rivals offers no real innovation,\" one of the Amazon employees wrote. \"And without competitive strength, Kiro's only survival mechanism becomes forced adoption rather than genuine value.\"\n\nClaude Code has become one of the most widely used AI coding services, and it underpins many other similar offerings from other providers. An Amazon spokesperson said about 70% of the company's software engineers used Kiro at least once in January.\n\nIn one forum thread, a manager overseeing Amazon's internal developer tools said he understood the \"frustration\" and \"significant\" interest in Claude Code, citing about 1,500 internal endorsements calling for its formal adoption.\n\nSome employees said frustration deepened after Amazon had previously indicated that Claude Code had cleared security and legal review for production use, according to an internal guideline and messages reviewed by Business Insider. That language was later edited and removed, employees said.\n\nOthers criticized the lack of transparency around the decision not to formally adopt Claude Code, asking what data informed the decision.\n\n\"The trend is clear,\" one employee wrote internally. \"More and more people would like to start using Claude Code and be officially supported by Amazon.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "The White House and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have a new protein-forard food pyramid that they say you can follow cheaply. I tried it out.",
    "fullText": "I didn't set out to follow a political diet, or any diet at all, really. But it was January, the new food pyramid was out, and according to the people in charge, it was healthy and easy to do on the cheap. Plus, I like a challenge.\n\nAt the start of the year, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. announced the federal government's new dietary guidelines for how Americans should aspire to eat. The gist: meat, full fats, and whole foods are in; sugars, processed foods, and excess carbs are out. After complaints that the recommendations leaned toward pricier food categories, the Secretary of Agriculture said you could follow the new protocol for as little as $3 a meal. I had my doubts, given grocery prices and inflation. Apparently she (or her staff) did, too, because Rollins later amended her indications to $15.64 a day.\n\nDespite my reservations, I decided to try it myself. For seven days, I would follow what I came to think of as the \"RFK diet\" on a $15-a-day budget to see just how realistic this whole thing was. Would I have regrets? Of course. Would I learn something? Honestly, yes — among other things, that spices are my friend, that I don't like apples that much, and that food is more political and emotional than we realize. Our identities, beliefs, and social statuses are wound up in every single decision we make, including what's for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\n\nI am not used to making a weekly grocery haul. One of the blessings of living in New York City is that there's usually a store close enough that it's fine to make multiple trips a week. This makes up for one of the curses of NYC, which is that most people don't have a car, so whatever you buy, you carry. So I enlist AI's help to ensure I don't miss anything and to make my spending calculations easier. I input the new guidance, explain my financial constraints, and the machine spits out a shopping list. As I scribble it down, I decide that a line from ChatGPT will be my shopping philosophy: \"This is not maximal pleasure. This is maximal compliance + realism.\"\n\nOnce I've hit the aisles, I adopt a second shopping philosophy: undershoot the budget. I can spend up to $105, but I wind up paying $70.31, leaving myself a $34.69 emergency fund in case things go awry. I'm actually pretty close to that initial $3-a-meal estimate, which would have left me with a $63 weekly budget.\n\nSince, besides the federal government, I am the one making the rules here, I decide on some adjustments. I'll use the olive oil, butter, salt, pepper, and spices already in my apartment because part of thrift is utilizing the resources you already have. The same goes for my already-owned instant coffee that will serve as a vehicle for whole milk. Moderate alcohol consumption is not an official budget consideration, but it seems fine since Dr. Oz says it's allowed and Dry January is passé. Price, quality, and availability are a delicate balance — I buy the cheapest peanut butter and ignore the ingredients list, which is surely not RFK Jr.-approved.\n\nAfter making some tough calls, this is my haul:\n\nIt would have made more sense to start this on a Monday morning, but there was a big snowstorm over the weekend, so Tuesday night kickoff it is. I start with some manageable basics, meaning I boil six eggs and rice and put them in the fridge, and I pick an easy recipe. Spoiler alert: I'm a terrible cook, so this is going to be a journey.\n\nI've never been much of a food prepper (or life prepper), so I'm pretty impressed with myself for what I'd imagine others might consider a pathetic performance. My dinner is decent. ChatGPT has armed me with a plan for my leftovers. I have not yet over-potatoed, nor am I aware that sentiment is on the horizon.\n\nDinner: Roasted chicken breast with potatoes and carrots\n\nThe vibe: Cautiously optimistic, until I remember this plan does not allow for dessert.\n\nMy AI-assisted meal plans tell me I have a variety of breakfast options. My heart tells me I have only one — bread with peanut butter — which I fear may be the culinary highlight of my week. A midday trip to the dentist and the accompanying novocaine make me nervous about the lunch situation, but luckily, my meal is basically mush — chicken, rice, and peas. I make a different combination of ingredients into what appears to be a largely identical plate of mush for dinner, and set aside the leftovers from my lunchtime mush for the office tomorrow.\n\nAt some point during all of this, I realize that I have the ingredients for an actual good mush: mashed potatoes. This is very exciting. Post-dinner, I notice a coworker's Instagram story of his New York Times-inspired creamy lasagna soup creation, which fits neither my diet nor my budget. My excitement fades.\n\nBreakfast: 1 piece of toast with peanut butter, coffee with milk\n\nLunch: Chicken breast, rice, and peas\n\nSnack: 1 apple, 2 slices cheddar cheese\n\nDinner: Ground beef skillet with onion, carrot, cabbage, and rice\n\nThe vibe: This is a lot like how I ate when I was broke in my 20s. I remember why I'm not a big fan of peas. Thank God for cheese.\n\nI've reached the \"bargaining\" stage of this endeavor quicker than I thought. I catch myself looking at the new and improved food pyramid multiple times throughout the day to see if there's something affordable but delicious that I'm missing. Broccoli? An avocado? The official guidelines list kimchi, which seems like the coastal political elite seeping through. Also, it's $10 in the grocery store, so no.\n\nChatGPT assures me the free seltzer water in my office is allowed, which is a treat. When someone in the office announces there are free Girl Scout cookies on her desk, I don't bother asking the robot if that's OK, because I already know the answer. I meet a friend for drinks after work and, somewhat ashamedly, explain that I can't stay for dinner because I pitched what I have now definitely decided was a very stupid idea. I will probably cheat sooner rather than later, but not yet.\n\nBreakfast: 2 hard-boiled eggs, coffee with milk\n\nSnack: 1 apple that I spent $1 on because I did not plan and forgot to bring one from home\n\nDinner: Ground beef skillet with onion, carrot, cabbage, and rice\n\nVibe: I have to find a way to mix this up tomorrow.\n\nThe point of food isn't just nourishment — it's pleasure. This is a sensation that this diet is severely lacking.\n\nIn the midst of my desperation, I text Morgan Dickison, a registered dietitian at Weill Cornell Medicine, to ask for advice. The first thing she asks after I show her my food diary is whether I'm hungry, which I'm not — I'm having some pretty big portions, and the food isn't exactly triggering additional cravings. She suggests seeking out some herbs, spices, and flavored oils, budget permitting. This prompts me to take a harder look at the spices in my cabinet to see what I might be able to incorporate. Her most specific recommendation: Rao's tomato sauce — it's not ultra-processed, and there's no added sugar. (This is not the case, unfortunately, with Rao's pesto.) She also low-key recommends I cool it on so much red meat. I wonder what RFK would say.\n\nI head to the grocery store to buy Rao's, but over the course of my five-minute walk, I forget why I'm there. I leave with chicken, an avocado, broccoli, two tomatoes, and corn tortillas, totaling $12.62. I have $22.07 left. Plus the $1 apple, so $21.07. Despite blanking on the sauce, the Morgan consultation/pep talk inspires what has been my best meal yet. Things may be looking up.\n\nBreakfast: 1 piece of toast with peanut butter, coffee with milk\n\nLunch: Beef skillet with onion, carrot, and lentils\n\nSnack: Hard-boiled egg, 2 slices cheddar cheese\n\nDinner: Grilled chicken breast with mashed potatoes\n\nVibe: Real live dietitian >>>>> AI.\n\nI am pretty committed to this bit, but I also don't want to be a freak. After a glass of wine at the Westminster dog show agility preliminaries (which is awesome), I realize I have to eat something, lest I be too buzzed to enjoy the amateur canine obstacle courses. I get an $8 chicken empanada, which almost certainly breaks the rules. I decide the day has no more rules and go out for dinner.\n\nBreakfast: 1 corn tortilla with 2 slices of cheddar cheese, in a quesadilla-type situation\n\nVibe: Between the very agile dogs and my cheat meal, I have had a great day.\n\nI wake feeling more confident about this experiment, thanks to my Friday dinner semi-success and probably the glow of Saturday's rule-breaking. I make an actually good brunch-type situation, and by \"I make\" I mean I generally start some things and then my boyfriend, a much better cook, takes over.\n\nFor dinner, it's too cold to go to the store, so I manage to scrounge up the ingredients from my boyfriend's brothers' apartment to make pasta and homemade pasta sauce. I use it to concoct the chicken Parmesan I've been thinking about since my failed Friday Rao's trip. I'm not sure if this is completely allowed, with the pasta (which is organic!) and also chicken breading, but I'm following along in spirit.\n\nBrunch: Mashed potato hashbrowns, scrambled eggs, 1 corn tortilla, ¼ avocado\n\nVibe: There is light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nPart of what set this exercise in motion was comments from Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, where she recommended a meal composed of a piece of chicken, a piece of broccoli, a corn tortilla, and \"one other thing.\" This is what I choose for my lunch finale, adding a quarter of an avocado as my \"other thing.\" It's pretty good, though I have to embiggen it from the description to make it actually filling.\n\nBreakfast: 1 corn tortilla with 2 slices of cheddar cheese, ¼ avocado\n\nLunch: The Brooke Rollins Special — 1 corn tortilla, chicken, broccoli, and ¼ avocado\n\nDinner: Ground beef and chickpea skillet with broccoli\n\nDoing the RFK diet on a $105-a-week food plan was not as hard as I thought it would be. I came in under budget by $13, even with the mid-week grocery trips and the dog show empanada (and not counting the Sunday freebies or Saturday cheat meal). But being on such a strict diet and budget did lead to some notable limitations. My regimen lacked any appreciable amount of variety, and it made eating into an act focused almost exclusively on survival.\n\nI ask Dickison, the dietitian, for a final rating of my adventure once I wrap it up. She says that, like a lot of people, I have room for improvement with fruits and veggies, commends my integration of chickpeas and lentils, and says I did a good job with protein at every meal, even if I was too heavy on ground beef. The budget piece of this undertaking is the hardest part, she says. It makes it challenging to incorporate some of the new food pyramid recommendations, such as berries, fresh vegetables, and fish, and it's not aligned with how people live. \"When I'm speaking with patients, we talk about all the different ways that you get food,\" she says. Sure, sometimes it's cooking at home, but it's also fast casual at the office, a restaurant on a night out, or delivery when people are pressed for time. \"The more convenient the option, the more expensive it gets,\" she says.\n\nWhat's also unrealistic: The ability to religiously follow such a rigid diet for an extended period of time. Hunger levels and cravings matter. \"It can be really difficult to manage those biological drives and also this premeditated budget, even if you did have the best intentions,\" Dickison says. I wish I could text her every day for food advice, but I fear she would block my number.\n\nThis funny little food journey of mine has coincided with a giant internet debate about some people using DoorDash too much and others scolding them for not cooking more at home. After a week of being bound to team cook-at-home, I'm overly sympathetic to team DoorDash, if only because I've spent the past week envisioning the treat I'm about to get myself — via my delivery app of choice, Seamless — now that this is all over. Variety is, as the eye-rolling adage goes, the spice of life. Being able to switch up not only the dish but also the delivery method from time to time is part of that.\n\nThe experience has made clear the sacrifices we constantly make around affordability, sustenance, and gratification when it comes to food. The cheapest option is never the healthiest option. The healthiest option is never the most thrilling option. The most thrilling option may be the cheapest, but it's usually bad for you.\n\nIt's an economic issue as much as it is cultural and political. When people on the lower end of the income spectrum — or public benefits — are told to focus on whole-food basics, they're told to give up on ease and joy as well. When people rely too much on delivery, they're almost certainly overspending, but they do so because it saves time and energy compared to an elaborate kitchen production. It's true that it's generally better to cook real meals with fresh ingredients at home. It's also true that life is complicated, and for a variety of reasons, that's not always possible. I probably could have stretched my budget just as far, if not farther, with frozen, preprepared options.\n\nUltimately, for most of us, dinner is less of an ideological project than it is a daily logistical problem — one that has to be solved, night after night, in perpetuity.\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "description": "Last year, Musk said \"the moon is a distraction.\" Now, he's talking about building a city there. The shift may be more strategic than it sounds.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has long framed SpaceX's mission in sweeping terms: to send humans to Mars and make humans interplanetary.\n\nAlong the way, the moon has played an inconsistent supporting role.\n\nSpaceX is under contract with NASA, for example, to send people to the moon, and that funding plays a key role in some of SpaceX's major projects. However, Musk's main messaging for years has been to build cities on Mars, not the moon.\n\nOn Sunday, that messaging seemed to take a hard 180.\n\n\"For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,\" Musk wrote on X. \"The mission of SpaceX remains the same: extend consciousness and life as we know it to the stars.\"\n\n\"The overriding priority is securing the future of civilization and the Moon is faster,\" Musk added.\n\nThe latest from Musk has sparked debate on forums about whether he has changed his mind about the moon. A closer look at his statements over the years suggests a more nuanced picture.\n\nMusk has simultaneously had his eyes on missions to both the moon and Mars, but has treated lunar missions as a shorter-term objective within his broader push toward Mars.\n\nThat reframing was most explicit in the Sunday post on X, where Musk said SpaceX would prioritize building lunar infrastructure before sending people to Mars.\n\n\"It is only possible to travel to Mars when the planets align every 26 months (six month trip time), whereas we can launch to the Moon every 10 days (2 day trip time). This means we can iterate much faster to complete a Moon city than a Mars city,\" Musk wrote. \"That said, SpaceX will also strive to build a Mars city and begin doing so in about 5 to 7 years.\"\n\nFor those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years. \n\nThe mission of SpaceX remains the same: extend consciousness and life as we know it to…\n\nThe message also echoed language from an internal SpaceX memo on February 2 that announced the company's acquisition of Musk's AI startup, xAI.\n\nThe science nerd-coded memo described futuristic plans such as extending \"the light of consciousness to the stars,\" floating AI-generating data centers — and permanent lunar bases that weren't on Earth.\n\nBoth the memo and Musk's recent post came roughly a year after he appeared to dismiss some lunar missions as a \"distraction,\" writing that SpaceX was \"going straight to Mars.\"\n\nNo, we’re going straight to Mars. The Moon is a distraction.\n\nMass to orbit is the key metric, thereafter mass to Mars surface. The former needs to be in the megaton to orbit per year range to build a self-sustaining colony on Mars.\n\nIn his 2025 post, Musk said the key constraint to building on Mars is how much payload you can routinely launch into orbit.\n\nHe has repeatedly argued that long-term moon exploration could help. But ultimately, Musk's past quotes suggest he wants moon missions to push momentum toward the peak goal of establishing a Mars colony.\n\nPublic statements dating back to at least 2017 also show Musk making a distinction between limited activity on the moon and a full-scale human civilization on Mars.\n\nIt is high time that humanity went beyond Earth. Should have a moon base by now and sent astronauts to Mars. The future needs to inspire. https://t.co/6HjDQnRSA5\n\nWhat has seemingly changed is SpaceX's timeline for reaching the red planet.\n\nThe company has repeatedly missed self-imposed deadlines for reaching Mars. Now, the intra-planetary timeline appears bound to be even more prolonged.\n\nMusk — who has admitted he can be overly optimistic when it comes to timelines — initially said SpaceX would fly humans to the red planet by 2024. In 2021, he pushed that timeline back to 2026. Now, he's saying SpaceX would have to wait until at least 2030 for its first Mars mission — if the lunar city is successful.\n\nAt the same time, SpaceX is under contractual pressure from the government to reach the moon.\n\nIn 2021, NASA hired the company to develop a reusable version of its Starship vehicle capable of ferrying astronauts to the moon as part of the Artemis program. Those contracts, worth billions of dollars, helped fund Starship's development.\n\nNASA expects the SpaceX-built rocket will take off for the moon's South Pole in 2028, according to the agency's website.\n\nStarship can enable a permanently crewed science station on the Moon, which would be super cool!\n\nMoonbase Alpha!!\n\nOverall, what looks like a change in philosophy might actually be a doubling down on SpaceX's initial plans to fly to the moon and Mars. Details for those missions may just be coming years later than initially expected.\n\nMusk, who plans to launch data centers in space, has also talked about the manufacturing opportunity that the moon represents.\n\n\"The biggest opportunity on the moon is to make solar cells and radiators, and then, you're manufacturing on the moon anything that weighs a lot, chips maybe still come from Earth, they weigh very little,\" Musk said during a December 30 X Spaces conversation.\n\n\"And then you can use a mass driver to put a billion tons of AI powered satellites into orbit per year. You could set a scale to 100 terawatts of AI compute per year from the moon,\" he added.\n\nSpaceX, which is preparing for a possible 2026 IPO and recently acquired Musk's AI company, xAI, is looking to scale up its compute resources to power increasingly powerful AI models. Musk has argued that space offers a more attractive medium to build out data centers than the Earth.\n\nMusk also suggested earlier this week that SpaceX would build a \"system that allows anyone to travel to the moon,\" without providing more details.\n\nMusk has previously said he'd like to travel to Mars — and possibly die on the planet. \"Just not on impact,\" he joked.",

    "description": "Trade tensions between the US and Canada escalate as Donald Trump threatens to delay the Gordie Howe International Bridge, challenging Mark Carney.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is singing \"No Canada\" as a sprawling bridge connecting Ontario to Detroit nears completion.\n\nThe Gordie Howe International Bridge is set to connect Detroit and Windsor, Ontario. Construction began in 2018, with an anticipated opening planned for 2024. Delays pushed the opening to 2026 — and Trump's threats could delay it even longer.\n\nThe US and Canada are engaged in an ongoing trade spat that includes liquor sales, travel, and electric vehicles. On Monday, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he wouldn't allow the bridge to open until Canada compensated the United States \"for everything we have given them.\"\n\nNegotiations would start immediately, Trump wrote. The bridge now remains in a state of limbo. Here's what you need to know.\n\nThere's already one bridge connecting Detroit and Windsor, Ontario.\n\nThe Ambassador Bridge opened in 1929. It's been privately owned by the Moroun family for decades. It reportedly carries about $360 million a day, or about 25% of the value of goods traveling between the US and Canada. It's also limited in its scale, with only four lanes, limited shoulders, and constricted traffic patterns leading up to it in Windsor.\n\nIn 2012, both Canada and Michigan approved the construction of a second bridge, the Gordie Howe. They officially broke ground in October 2018 on the 1.5-mile, six-lane bridge, which will also include a walking and biking path.\n\nThe bridge cost an estimated CA$6.4 billion, or about $4.7 billion. Canada paid for the entire project and plans to recoup its investment through toll revenues.\n\nMichigan will also own a part of the bridge, and the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority will manage operations.\n\nIn his Truth Social post, Trump wrote that the bridge would not open until Canada treated the US with the \"Fairness and Respect that we deserve.\"\n\nThe feud between Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has reached a fever pitch. At Davos, the two world leaders exchanged fiery speeches. Canada recently reached a \"preliminary agreement\" for a trade deal with China, and Trump responded with the threat of 100% tariffs.\n\nCanada's deal with China would allow up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles to enter the Canadian market at the \"most-favoured-nation tariff rate of 6.1%.\" In exchange, Carney expected China to lower tariffs on Canadian agricultural tariffs.\n\nCanada's deal with China was a point of contention in Trump's post about the bridge. He wrote that China would \"eat Canada alive,\" and said the country would ban hockey and eliminate the Stanley Cup.\n\nTrump wrote that the US \"should own, perhaps, at least one half of this asset.\" (Michigan and Canada already jointly own the bridge.)\n\nThere's also the Moroun family, which owns the existing Ambassador Bridge. They've publicly lobbied Trump to stop the new bridge, going so far as to air a commercial in 2018. And on Tuesday, The New York Times reported that Matthew Moroun met with Howard Lutnick, the US Commerce Secretary, about the project. Hours after that reported meeting, Trump posted about the bridge on Truth Social.\n\nIt wasn't always like this. During Trump's first presidency, he issued a statement with then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in support of the project.\n\n\"We look forward to the expeditious completion of the Gordie Howe International Bridge, which will serve as a vital economic link between our two countries,\" the two leaders wrote.\n\nCarney said he spoke to Trump on Tuesday morning about the bridge, explaining that Canadians had paid in full for the project and that Michigan already had an ownership stake.\n\nOne of Trump's critiques was that the bridge was not built using American products. Carney said he told Trump the bridge was built with American and Canadian workers and steel from both the US and Canada.\n\n\"It was a positive conversation,\" Carney said.\n\nMichigan, the second party in the agreement with Canada, doesn't seem thrilled, either. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said that she was in communication with Trump's staff, and that the bridge was a \"really important part of our economy.\"\n\nAnd they may not wait for Trump's approval. Whitmer's press secretary said on Tuesday that the bridge would open \"one way or another.\"",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Alex Seungyong Yang, an 18-year-old high school senior, based in Seoul. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAs an incoming university freshman and the founder of an AI research startup, AI feels like a double-edged sword.\n\nI started my AI research and development startup with other students around the world, and AI has been amazing for us. It's allowed us to push further and think about achieving things we couldn't have imagined. On the other hand, I'm pursuing a computer science major this fall, and I keep hearing that computer science jobs are being replaced by AI.\n\nNo one has explicitly told me that pursuing computer science is a complete waste of time, but many people around me have expressed concerns about the risks it entails. I think those concerns point to something valid.\n\nSimply learning how to code no longer guarantees a stable or well-defined career path, but there are still many opportunities by staying within what I would call the \"eye of the typhoon\" and studying these machines, even if they are increasingly unpredictable.\n\nFrom 2025 to 2026, the tech industry changed so much. Last year, there was still a broad sense of expansion and experimentation, startups, new tools, and huge model launches. Now, what feels dominant is resource concentration in capital, compute, and top talent, along with a narrowing focus on AI infrastructure.\n\nThis kind of acceleration makes it so that one year doesn't feel like just a single year anymore. I think that computer science, engineering, and very technical majors are the only majors that can fully understand how this industry is changing and the direction of that change.\n\nI think the important part of studying computer science isn't about basic coding or programming; it's understanding the logic behind it and the framework that can be applied anywhere, anytime, wherever we are with technology. It's all about solving the problem, and I think that kind of talent is most relevant in the AI era.\n\nStudying computer science will help me adapt more flexibly and with greater urgency in my career. I want to use the knowledge from my degree to develop a niche kind of talent rather than simply following a very conventional pathway and becoming another factory-made worker.\n\nBeing unemployed or unable to find a job used to be the most obvious failure. Now, given how frequently unemployment is already happening around us, I don't think it can even be considered the greatest failure anymore. To me, the biggest failure would be an inability to adapt, and if we become irrelevant as technology advances.\n\nA small number of people or companies can now build and deploy things at a scale that used to require much larger organizations. Rather than only preparing for predefined roles, I spend time now and will continue to during my degree, building real systems, contributing to research, and working on projects where the constraints are unclear and the outcomes are uncertain.\n\nI see my computer science degree as a way to build depth, judgment, and adaptability rather than just technical skills.\n\nI don't see this as a guaranteed strategy, and I'm still learning what truly matters, but I hope that developing this ability in specific domains matters the most. I'm in competition with AI, but it's equally a competition with other people. I want to become an irreplaceable person, not just with AI, but also relative to other people.\n\nMany peers around me who are pursuing computer science and working on startups believe this is actually the easiest era to start something and succeed. Some majors naturally keep people closer to the frontier of change. I believe studying computer science, engineering, or mathematics trains you to reason from first principles, work with abstraction, and stay comfortable with uncertainty.\n\nThose habits matter more than any specific technical skills, which may quickly become outdated. Because the underlying skills are transferable, people in these fields may be better positioned to adapt when conditions change, even if the direction of change is unclear.\n\nI'm excited to pursue computer science, even though it might be uncertain how it will turn out. Things may become more complex, demanding, and challenging than I can anticipate, but I still believe there will be abundant opportunities for those who are willing to adapt, go deep, and continuously redefine their value.\n\nDo you have a story to share about higher education and AI?

    "title": "Epstein was planning a major renovation to his private islands. Here's what he wanted it to look like.",
    "description": "The plans for the islands, Little St. James and Great St. James, were to include a \"ladies' residence\" and master retreat, the Epstein files reveal.",
    "fullText": "One year before he was charged with sex trafficking, Jeffrey Epstein was planning a major renovation of his private islands, Little St. James and Great St. James, documents newly released by the Department of Justice reveal.\n\nHundreds of pages of emails, contracts, and renderings in the Epstein files give insight into his plans for the islands, one of which has become notorious for the sexual abuse that prosecutors allege occurred there, as well as an inside look into his exacting nature.\n\nOver the course of eight months, Epstein paid at least $150,000 to Florida-based design firm Radyca for architectural and interior plans.\n\nThe remit: \"My employer owns 2 islands in the Caribbean off of St. Thomas that he would like completely redone,\" one of Epstein's assistants wrote the firm in November 2017.\n\nThe work was supposed to begin in January 2019 and take two years, according to a December 2017 agreement. Epstein fired the firm in June 2018, emails show.\n\nRamon Alonso, the president of Radyca and Epstein's main point of contact for the work, declined to comment on the project or the island. He visited the island at least twice, according to emails and travel information included in the files.\n\nVarious schematics, proposals, and designs — as well as the correspondence about them — reveal how Epstein imagined the properties.\n\nThe plans for the two islands included a \"ladies' residence\" and master retreat in proximity, as well as a cinema, a \"funhouse point,\" and various other guest pavilions and outbuildings.\n\nThe ladies' residence was of particular interest to Epstein and the subject of dozens of emails between Epstein and Alonso, who discussed the appropriate structure for \"the girls.\"\n\nEpstein also gave several notes on the 7,700-square-foot master retreat. In one email, Alonso wrote that \"we completely isolated the bedroom from any noise or daylight as requested.\" In another, Epstein said he didn't want guests above his bedroom and that his bedroom windows didn't need to open any more than to \"air out the place.\"\n\nThe designs were inspired by luxury hotels, including the Soori Hotel in Bali and the Amanera in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThroughout the process, tensions arose between the disgraced financier and his design team.\n\n\"i might add that the cost incurred to date. are mine. with virutally nothing to show for it,\" Epstein wrote in a May 2018 email, with his usual idiosyncratic punctuation.\n\nIn other emails, he called the designs \"silly,\" said he was \"shocked and disappointed,\" and told Alonso that the firm had created \"nothing at all . of any use. ZERO.\"\n\n\"Please understand that I don't mind changing direction as many times as it's needed to your full satisfaction and I also really like you and working with you but I don't appreciate when you diminish our work,\" Alonso wrote in an email to Epstein.\n\nTwo weeks later, Alonso was fired.\n\n\"this is silly sorry i have no more time for this,\" Epstein wrote on June 30, 2018. \"I wish you well.\"\n\nIt was the last correspondence between the pair in the files. About one year later, Epstein was arrested, and the FBI raided the island. Photos taken at the time show the redesign never occurred.\n\nLittle St. James was central to the disgraced financier's sex-trafficking operation, according to witness testimony included in the US's 2019 case accusing Epstein of sexual abuse and trafficking of underage girls. Epstein pleaded not guilty and died by suicide in jail that year while awaiting trial.\n\nThe US Virgin Islands, where the properties are located, sued Epstein's estate following his death, accusing him of sex trafficking and abusing underage girls on the islands. They reached a settlement in 2022, with the estate agreeing to pay the government of the Virgin Islands $105 million in cash, half the proceeds of a planned sale of Little St. James, and other damages. The settlement did not include any admission of guilt.\n\nEpstein purchased the 72-acre Little St. James in 1998 for $7.95 million. In 2016, he added the 162-acre Great St. James to his portfolio for $22.5 million, according to deeds included in the Epstein files. Epstein's islands sold in 2023 for $60 million — less than half of the initial $125 million asking price. The buyer, billionaire Stephen Deckoff, has said he plans to transform them into a luxury resort.\n\nThroughout his decades on the Little St. James — often referred to as Little St. Jeff's — Epstein hosted famous and powerful figures.\n\nLinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman, Google cofounder Sergey Brin, and Howard Lutnick had plans to visit Little St. James, according to emails in the latest batch of Epstein files.\n\nThe island had a reputation for parties and, in Epstein's words, \"a ratio\" of men to women that could make women \"uncomfortable.\"\n\n\"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\" Musk asked Epstein in 2012 about the possibility of a visit that Musk said never occurred.\n\nOver the years, Epstein embarked on several redesign projects, documents and emails included in the Epstein files show, hiring architects, surveyors, and decorators.\n\nThe renovations and redecoration of the islands were also a subject of the 2021 testimony of Ghislaine Maxwell's former executive assistant, Cimberly Espinosa, with one detail so unexpected that the judge had to follow up\n\n\"We even shipped in sand and palm trees and all kinds of things to get the island to what he wanted it to be,\" she said, answering the judge's questions about the scope of her work on the island.\n\n\"To be clear,\" the judge said, \"you shipped in sand to a tropical island, why was that?\"\n\n\"He wanted more sand on the beach,\" the former assistant said.\n\nJacob Shamsian contributed reporting to this story.",

    "fullText": "Over the last half-decade, perhaps no one has personified the archetype of a finance bro more than Mark Moran.\n\nHis cuff-links pop out of tailored suits. He posts on X about his preferred loafers. In 2024, he told Business Insider about his love for Zyn.\n\nNow, he's leaving it all behind — or, rather, he's bringing it all to the world of politics.\n\nMoran is launching a bid for Senate in Virginia, running as a Democrat against incumbent Mark Warner. He'll try to build off the online popularity he's generated in recent years as a Wall Street culture personality.\n\nAfter stints at investment banking like Lazard and Centerview Partners, Moran first gained notoriety after being selected as a contestant on HBO's Fboy Island reality dating show in 2021. He then became the first employee of the popular financial meme account Litquidity before launching his own investor relations firm, Equity Animal, in 2022.\n\nDespite being a prominent face for millennials in finance, the 33-year-old said his experience is fueling his move away from the industry and into politics.\n\nHe ended up leaving his first two jobs because of moral issues he had with some of the deals he worked on. Now, Moran, who calls himself a populist, is running on a platform that, in many ways, is a rebellion against his old line of work.\n\n\"I'm like, wait, these people are the quote-unquote titans of the universe?\" he told Business Insider, reflecting on his first impressions of working on Wall Street.\n\nOne of his proposals is to ban corporations from owning single-family homes, similar to an executive order President Donald Trump recently signed to curb home ownership by institutional investors.\n\nAnother proposal is to reform campaign finance laws to keep Wall Street and corporate money out of politics.\n\n\"We have a captured legislative branch,\" he said. \"I'm very much against the control that Wall Street has been able to have over politicians.\"\n\nMoran also wants to take on a Wall Street darling right now: AI data centers, which are fueling the AI buildout that's helped drive the S&P 500 up by 94% since late 2022.\n\nHe's proposing a tax on data centers that would fund community colleges.\n\n\"Someone is gonna come in, pay for the campaign of a Republican who's quote-unquote business-friendly, and they're gonna give designation as critical infrastructure to win our war of AI against China — which I want to happen, but the people are not going to get anything in return,\" Moran said.\n\n\"If we were to put a compute tax on the data centers, over the next 10 years, that could be $100 billion, if not more,\" he continued. \"That would be enough to entirely change the community college system to make it so that we could have universal community college.\"",

    "description": "Some bigger firms are using AI to embrace a classic startup mentality to quickly identify what works — and cast aside what doesn't.",
    "fullText": "For some companies building with AI, failure isn't a setback. It's the strategy.\n\nOkta, Salesforce, Snowflake, Blackstone, and others are rapidly launching AI products, fully expecting that not all of them will pan out. Executives say they can't afford to meticulously test ideas in isolation if they want to outpace their competitors, and AI makes it easy to deploy new offerings at scale anyway.\n\n\"It's increased the pace of what's possible,\" said Eric Kelleher, president and chief operating officer of digital-identity company Okta, which has rolled out around 120 AI pilots and features over the past two years, keeping half and scrapping the rest. \"You can spin up a lot more pilots at the same time.\"\n\nThis so-called fail-fast method isn't new, as tech startups have been doing it for decades. It's now gaining traction among larger, established businesses due to the AI boom.\n\nLeaders say they're under pressure from their boards and shareholders to justify their AI spending, and that the fail-fast approach is helping them meet the moment.\n\n\"The stakes are higher, the risks are bigger, and to keep pace with the innovation churn, we need to fail faster than ever,\" Cisco's senior vice president and global innovation officer, Guy Diedrich, told Business Insider.\n\nFor some companies, fail fast isn't just a mindset — it represents a new reality driven by AI efficiency gains.\n\nSnowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy said the cloud-data platform company has rolled out numerous pilot programs, often moving from a planning meeting on Monday to a demo by Friday. With its agentic support system, he said, many cases that once took hours to debug can now be resolved in about 20 minutes.\n\nSimilarly, something like preparing a customer briefing for an executive used to take hours. Now, Ramaswamy said, it can be done in a minute by asking a sales agent.\n\nJohn Stecher, the chief technology officer at Blackstone, told Business Insider that the \"fail fast\" mindset has long been a mainstay in the engineering world, but AI tools have enabled companies to accelerate development timelines.\n\n\"Our software engineers, by quantifiable metrics, are about 2x more effective than they were in 2024 with writing code,\" Stecher said, adding that they now have the ability to deliver faster and higher quality work.\n\nHe said the \"blocking-and-tackling part of software development and engineering,\" including tasks like writing unit tests and higher-quality code, allows engineers to \"deploy more robust,\" reliable, and secure code, so that workers spend less time fixing bugs and more time building. That increase in productivity allows teams to build prototypes more quickly and launch them to users faster.\n\nRamaswamy similarly said that a lot of the heavy lifting on engineering teams for tasks like boilerplate code, tests, and migrations happens much faster. That frees workers to spend more time on tasks that require judgment, architecture, and design, he said.\n\nMoving at warp speed comes with risks, however.\n\nLast year, Salesforce launched an AI agent designed to answer customer queries, and it recommended a competitor's application to a user. The user then wrote about the snafu on LinkedIn, said Joe Inzerillo, president of enterprise and AI at the software company.\n\nAnother time, one of Salesforce's newly released AI agents provided a customer with false information gleaned from old web pages that had been removed from its website but were still crawlable by search engines. The error was discovered during a review of conversations the agent was having with users.\n\nThough both incidents exposed early-stage gaps to users, Inzerillo said they also revealed important insights into how users interact with the products and how experiences can be improved. \"We're going into every single deployment as an experiment to try to learn something,\" said Inzerillo.\n\nThe consequences of failing fast, however, can be worse if companies overlook important security measures.\n\nStecher said companies in general shouldn't necessarily deploy more products just because they can now do so more easily. He said firms need a \"robust checks and balances\" system and have data privacy and security controls in place from the get-go, or they'll pay the price with outages or cyber issues.\n\nSnowflake's Ramaswamy said that while the \"fail fast\" concept is reappearing, the current version is \"less about recklessness and more about shortening the feedback loop.\" He said the phrase \"iterating rapidly\" is a more accurate way to describe the company's approach to building with AI.\n\n\"We identify areas that we know are going to be generally positively impacted by AI, but set up small, almost weekly, goals,\" Ramaswamy said. \"This way, we can adjust and know when things are working well and when we need to course correct.\"",

    "description": "Kirsten Scheller had a very common colon cancer symptom at 19 and saw multiple doctors. She wasn't diagnosed until she was 22, at stage 3.",
    "fullText": "For years, Kirsten Scheller was told the same thing by her doctors: she was too young and too active for colon cancer.\n\nIn 2010, when she was a 19-year-old college sopho\n\n\"Being in college and being a woman, I didn't really think much about those symptoms,\" Scheller, now 36, told Business Insider. Plus, she was in great shape: she played three sports in high school, and continued to hike and run in college. \"I was extremely active and eating well,\" she said. \"I was training for a duathlon and doing a lot of yoga.\"\n\nHer mother, a nurse, saw cause for concern anyway and pushed her to see a GI specialist. Over the next two years, as the blood in her stool got worse, she lost track of the total number of doctors she saw. Because of her age, overall good health, and lack of family history, they all said the same thing: Maybe it was stress, or internal hemorrhoids.\n\nIt turned into a perpetual loop of dismissal and encouragement to monitor symptoms. \"I was sent home and told to come back if it continues to happen,\" Scheller said. \"And of course, it just continued to happen.\"\n\nThen, when she was 22 and a month away from college graduation, she saw one more GI specialist. Then a screening led to her being diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer.\n\n\"It was just a mix of emotions,\" she said. \"I was scared, but also validated just from having these symptoms and having a gut feeling that something was wrong and finally having an answer for it.\"\n\nBefore graduation, Scheller saw a gastroenterologist at Minnesota Gastroenterology, who recommended a flexible sigmoidoscopy, which is less invasive than a colonoscopy and doesn't examine the entire colon.\n\nBecause Scheller was somewhat awake for the procedure, she caught a glimpse of the tumor before she fully knew what it was.\n\n\"I just remember the scope turning a corner and seeing a trail of blood,\" she said. \"And then as they continued to move through, we saw this really large mass.\"\n\nThe staff stayed calm and told her they would biopsy it, giving Scheller a clue that \"something was off.\" Then, a nurse came into Scheller's room before the doctor had a chance to speak to Scheller and expressed her condolences to Scheller and her mom. \"We knew that probably wasn't just a benign type of tumor,\" she said.\n\nDays later, Scheller got the call — she had colon cancer. She was at her parents' house while they were at work. The worst part, she said, was relaying the news to them.\n\nShe wouldn't learn what stage of colon cancer she had until her colon resection surgery, which removed a foot of her colon. She also had 24 lymph nodes removed, as the cancer had spread.\n\nWhen she woke up, she learned she had stage 3 colon cancer. Based on the types of cancer cells they found and how quickly they were dividing, her doctor told her that she'd likely have had stage 4 had she waited a few more months.\n\nKnowing how much worse it could have been, \"just hit even harder,\" she said.\n\nBeing diagnosed so close to graduation, Scheller was able to complete her finals at the hospital and walk to get her degree as planned.\n\nThen, she jumped right into treatment: intensive chemotherapy for the next nine months.\n\nEmotionally, it was hard to put a hold on her post-college dreams as a freshly minted neuroscience grad. \"You go through college thinking, 'What is my first job going to be? Where am I going to live? You're kind of excited to start this adult life,'\" she said.\n\nThen there were the treatment side effects. Back in 2010, less was known about fertility preservation options for cancer patients. To try and preserve her egg quality, Scheller was injected with Lupron, which shut down her ovaries during chemotherapy. The result was \"full-blown menopause,\" Scheller said, which included experiencing hot flashes and headaches while she was being treated.\n\nShe also developed \"horrible neuropathy\" from the chemotherapy, leading to pain and tingling in her hands and feet after treatment was finished. She went to physical therapy for months before starting her first job to regain hand function. \"I had to teach myself how to write again,\" she said. Of all the side effects, neuropathy was the worst — she went to physical therapy and acupuncture for years after treatment was over to manage symptoms.\n\nAll the while, her social network was in flux. While she had a wonderful support system — her parents, older sister, childhood friends, and extended family — her college relationships took a hit.\n\n\"Unfortunately, many friends that I had met kind of drifted away or didn't know how to support someone at that age going through advanced-stage cancer,\" she said, though she didn't blame them. \"That was the hardest part, this grief of losing friendships while I had to grow up extremely quickly and just not know what the next week was going to look like.\"\n\nOtherwise, her life feels pretty normal. She bought a starter home in Minneapolis at 26, and still lives there a decade later, only now with her husband and two dogs. And she's worked at Medtronic, a medical equipment company, for nearly 13 years — starting shortly after she finished her cancer treatment.\n\nIn her spare time, she is training for her first half-marathon and planning a 100-mile hike in Europe. \"I would've never guessed when I was 22 what I would be doing now, but I'm just super grateful to be healthy,\" she said.\n\nShe's also shared her story with several colon cancer non-profits to raise awareness around early symptoms and screening. Luckily, she's noticed a positive change over the years.\n\n\"Now, we're actually talking about it,\" she said. While she feels there's still stigma around certain symptoms like bloody stools, \"there's social media, people are sharing their stories.\" Her hope is that people who hear these stories take action and get screened if they experience common colon cancer symptoms.\n\nKnowing what she knows now, she would also recommend advocating for a full colonoscopy over a flexible sigmoidoscopy for screening. While a colonoscopy usually requires anesthesia and is a more involved procedure, it's also more thorough in examining the whole colon.\n\nEven with the days of her treatment long behind her, it's still an experience she thinks about every day. \"My badge picture still shows me in a full wig,\" she said, having started her job right after finishing chemotherapy. \"I have a daily reminder, when I look at that picture, of everything I went through.\"",

    "description": "AI agents could eventually take on a lot of tasks done by humans. Yet hallucinations present a challenge currently, says a former Google exec.",
    "fullText": "Despite some CEOs' enthusiasm, AI agents aren't always up to the task.\n\nAgents are software programs that can perform tasks independently, such as reconciling an invoice, so that a person doesn't have to. Sounds great, right? That's why companies are plugging agents into tasks across sales, finance, supply chains, and engineering.\n\nYet while agentic systems can be effective at completing discrete tasks, they can be fragile at scale.\n\nErrors can quickly become a bottleneck if hallucinations multiply when agents interact, said Nicolas Darveau-Garneau, a former Google executive and author of the book \"Be a Sequoia, Not a Bonsai.\"\n\nIf a single agent has a 5% hallucination rate, then it's hard to daisy-chain multiple agents without a high risk of errors. That's because the risk increases exponentially, he told Business Insider.\n\n\"The only way we get massive productivity gains is the day that we can trust that the AI is not hallucinating a lot,\" Darveau-Garneau said.\n\nFor now, he said, that's why general-purpose, autonomous agentic AI is largely aspirational.\n\nNevertheless, hallucinations are something that Darveau-Garneau expects will be \"mostly solved\" five years from now.\n\nIf that happens, he said, the productivity gains of 10% to 30% that some companies are getting from AI could be far greater — perhaps on the order of 10x to 100x.\n\nThose gains matter because the bigger they get, the more likely it becomes that companies will reorganize their operations, including the possibility of needing fewer employees.\n\nEven if companies don't cut staff, many roles — especially desk jobs — are likely to change.\n\nThe challenge of scaling agents and AI broadly is one reason Darveau-Garneau expects companies to still need some humans in jobs that sometimes appear to be endangered, like coding.\n\nAn excellent software engineer, he said, might be 30% to 40% more productive with AI. It's a nice lift, Darveau-Garneau said, but not a reason for a company to get rid of all its engineers.\n\nWorkers are understandably fearful of losing their jobs to AI, especially when leaders emphasize productivity gains, he said.\n\nDarveau-Garneau said that the CEO's primary job when it comes to AI is to create the right environment for adoption — including training and making sure that employees feel \"psychologically safe.\"\n\nThat's why, he said, leaders would be wise to reframe the conversation to say they want to double a company's size, for example, while increasing the employee base by 30%, rather than suggesting they deploy AI and cut 20% of the staff.\n\nOne challenge for many leaders has been understanding what new roles will look like thanks to AI, Muqsit Ashraf, group chief executive of strategy at Accenture, told Business Insider.\n\nThat is proving difficult, at least in part, because some current job descriptions may change, and other jobs may become redundant. Still others will have to be \"radically redefined,\" he said.\n\n\"What companies have been doing, by and large, is putting AI in the hands of people in their existing roles with existing tasks,\" Ashraf said.\n\nThat might mean automating some tasks or using AI to supercharge how someone searches for information or how quickly they can conduct a competitive analysis.\n\n\"But how does that fundamentally change my day?\" he said.\n\nCompanies have struggled, Ashraf said, if they've tended to think about adopting AI within their current ways of working, rather than redesigning the organization with an eye toward future jobs.\n\n\"It's not about layering AI on existing roles. It's about rethinking all of these processes and activities,\" he said.\n\nDespite the challenge of redesigning how companies are set up, Ashraf said it's encouraging that many C-suite leaders recognize the need to help their workers build the skills needed to prepare for the changes stemming from companies' decisions to prioritize AI.\n\nAI might still have limitations, but its rapid pace of improvement means workers themselves also need to prioritize staying current. Otherwise, they risk falling behind, Alex Salazar, cofounder and CEO of the AI infrastructure startup Arcade, told Business Insider.\n\nA year ago, the coding agents that the company's software engineers now use couldn't do any of what they can do today, he said.\n\n\"What does that mean for your job as an engineer?\" Salazar said. \"It's got to evolve.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "description": "A new command-and-control system is expected to make planning and decision-making faster and easier.",
    "fullText": "New US Army warfighting software is speeding up and simplifying the command job, a commander said recently, sharing that it lets him scrap the \"hourlong staff meetings\" to make decisions.\n\nThe Army, like other services, believes that future wars will be determined by the speed of decision-making. That's where the new Next Generation Command and Control, or NGC2, program is expected to make a substantial impact and modernize how the service fights.\n\nAt Fort Carson, Colorado, the Army's 4th Infantry Division has been testing NGC2 in a series of exercises. The most recent one, Ivy Sting 4, added more components to the system, with different types of sensors and weapons on the battlefield feeding into one system that everyone can access.\n\n\"So it's all in one place, and it's there very, very quickly, so that the staff can see it across their functional systems,\" said Maj. Gen. Patrick Ellis, commander of the 4th ID, at a recent media roundtable, explaining that \"the fires person can see what the logistician sees, can see what the intel person sees.\"\n\n\"I don't have to have the hourlong staff meeting anymore,\" the general said.\n\n\"If we're actually using the technology as the tool that we're prepping on and that we're also fighting on,\" he said, \"I could sit there, I can look at it, I can make decisions, I can say, 'Hey, here are my priorities for this or that.' We all agree on it, we click save, and that's done.\"\n\nThe Army has facilitated the development of NGC2 with both the 4th ID and 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii and industry teams, including Anduril and Lockheed Martin, pursuing a Silicon Valley-style approach aimed at moving faster and rapidly integrating soldier feedback, delivering fixes immediately rather than months or years later.\n\nOn the heels of Ivy Sting 4, more than two weeks of field testing that involved live-fire exercises and an electronic warfare jamming scenario, Ellis and others said that NGC2 was making planning and executing battlefield missions more effective.\n\n\"We are no longer fighting with the network; we are now fighting using the network,\" Ellis said.\n\nDuring the Ivy Sting 4 testing event, 20 different types of sensors, such as drones, electronic warfare systems, artillery, and Stryker vehicles, were linked together.\n\nData and artificial intelligence capabilities provide real-time information on the sensors. Soldiers can see how much ammunition they've got left or whether a Stryker will need maintenance or fuel soon. Simulations can predict what resources will be needed for certain tactics or actions, including different ways an enemy might attack.\n\nAs different platforms are brought onto NGC2, broadening what the platform can do, Army command and soldiers can see and communicate using the same data. The system is breaking down the silos that have previously hindered information flow.\n\n\"I'm feeling empowered as a commander to make more, better, and faster decisions because I've got access to all that data,\" Ellis explained.\n\nMany NGC2 components are being built with off-the-shelf technology and standard commercial software practices, and the vendor teams involved are working on the ground with soldiers. The closer working relationship means soldier feedback is being incorporated more quickly.\n\n\"We work through these obstacles, and we learn how to do something, and once we run into a roadblock, we figure out a way to solve that problem, and then that problem is now solved for the Army,\" he said. \"We're not relearning these lessons over and over again.\"",

    "fullText": "The New York Times argued that it was “time to acknowledge reality” and “admit” that the United States has a “marijuana problem” in a new editorial admitting that the legalization of weed in most states has had a wide variety of adverse consequences.\n\n“This editorial board has long supported marijuana legalization. In 2014, we published a six-part series that compared the federal marijuana ban to alcohol prohibition and argued for repeal. Much of what we wrote then holds up — but not all of it does,” began the Times. “At the time, supporters of legalization predicted that it would bring few downsides. In our editorials, we described marijuana addiction and dependence as ‘relatively minor problems.’ Many advocates went further and claimed that marijuana was a harmless drug that might even bring net health benefits. They also said that legalization might not lead to greater use.”\n\n“It is now clear that many of these predictions were wrong. Legalization has led to much more use. Surveys suggest that about 18 million people in the United States have used marijuana almost daily (or about five times a week) in recent years. That was up from around six million in 2012 and less than one million in 1992. More Americans now use marijuana daily than alcohol,” it acknowledged. “This wider use has caused a rise in addiction and other problems. Each year, nearly 2.8 million people in the United States suffer from cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, which causes severe vomiting and stomach pain. More people have also ended up in hospitals with marijuana-linked paranoia and chronic psychotic disorders. Bystanders have also been hurt, including by people driving under the influence of pot.”\n\nInstead of calling for a total rollback that would recriminalize the sale and use of the drug, the Gray Lady advocated a policy of “grudging toleration” that might upset “Big Weed,” which, it argues has “a financial incentive to mislead the public about what they are selling.”\n\n“Marijuana companies, not casual smokers, are the biggest winners of Mr. Trump’s decision to reclassify the drug from Schedule I to Schedule III. The change will increase the profits of these businesses by causing the tax code to treat them more favorably. This does not qualify as grudging toleration,” it submitted before concluding: “The unfortunate truth is that the loosening of marijuana policies — especially the decision to legalize pot without adequately regulating it — has led to worse outcomes than many Americans expected. It is time to acknowledge reality and change course.”\n\nThe post ‘Time to Acknowledge Reality’: The New York Times Warns America Has a ‘Marijuana Problem’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "In a floor speech, Ro Khanna, a Democratic representative, revealed identities of six men after seeing unredacted files",
    "fullText": "Ro Khanna, the US congressman, publicly revealed the names of six men whose identities were redacted from the Jeffrey Epstein files, including Leslie Wexner, a billionaire retail magnate, whom the FBI appeared to have labeled as a co-conspirator.\n\nThe Democratic representative of California disclosed the names during a floor speech on Tuesday, following a visit to the Department of Justice, where he and Thomas Massie, a Republican congressman from Kentucky, spent two hours reviewing unredacted documents.\n\nThe six men named by Khanna are Wexner, the Victoria’s Secret founder; Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, CEO of DP World and an Emirati billionaire businessman; and four others identified as Nicola Caputo, Salvatore Nuara, Zurab Mikeladze and Leonic Leonov.\n\nKhanna did not provide evidence of wrongdoing against any of them nor have they been charged with a crime in connection with Epstein.\n\n“If we found six men that they were hiding in two hours, imagine how many men they are covering up for in those 3m files,” Khanna said during his floor speech.\n\nKhanna said that when he and Massie identified the redactions for justice department officials, “they acknowledged their mistake” and revealed the identities. He said that the majority of the files remain redacted.\n\nEpstein admitted guilt in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution and completed a 13-month sentence. He died in an apparent suicide in a New York jail in 2019 while facing trial on sex-trafficking charges.\n\nBeing named in the Epstein files does not establish guilt, as individuals may appear simply through email correspondence, contact information or other documentation referencing the disgraced sex offender financier.\n\nHere are the six now unredacted names:\n\nThe 88-year-old Wexner, who established a retail empire that includes Victoria’s Secret, Abercrombie & Fitch and Bath & Body Works, maintained a lengthy financial relationship with Epstein, who handled his investments for many years.\n\nIn a lengthy investigation from the New York Times in November, Wexner is attributed as the person who launched Epstein’s financial status from millionaire to plutocrat. Aside from the money, his “greatest value to Epstein was that he imbued him with new credibility and credentials”, the reporters wrote.\n\nThough Wexner’s ties to Epstein were already publicly known and his name had surfaced in previous releases, it has now been revealed that he appears to have been labeled a co-conspirator with Epstein by the FBI, though he faces no criminal charges in connection with Epstein’s offenses.\n\nThe Dubai-based businessman leads DP World, a multinational ports and logistics enterprise with operations spanning more than 80 countries. He’s also the brother of Mohammed Ben Sulayem, the head of the FIA, which governs the world’s motorsport championships, including Formula One.\n\nRecently disclosed documents reveal that Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem emailed Epstein in 2015 that he met a girl “two years ago” that went to an American university in Dubai was “the best sex I ever had amazing body”.\n\n“She got engaged but now she back with me,” he said.\n\nMassie also said that since the names were unredacted, it appears the justice department confirmed that Sulayem was the recipient of an email from Epstein in which he said: “I loved the torture video.”\n\nA man by the name of Nicola Caputo is an Italian politician who represented his country in the European parliament between 2014 and 2019 before taking a senior position in Campania’s regional administration, but no verified evidence confirms this individual is mentioned in the officially released documents, and established news organizations have not corroborated any link between him and the files.\n\nIt is not yet known who this person is and how they are connected to Epstein.\n\nIt is not yet known who this person is and how they are connected to Epstein.\n\nIt is not yet known who this person is and how they are connected to Epstein.",

    "fullText": "STARKE, Fla. (AP) — A man convicted of killing a traveling salesman he and his brother had met at a bar has become the first person executed in Florida this year.\n\nRonald Palmer Heath, 64, was pronounced dead at 6:12 p.m. Tuesday following a three-drug injection at Florida State Prison near Starke. Heath was convicted of first-degree murder, robbery with a deadly weapon and other charges in the 1989 killing of Michael Sheridan.\n\nWhen the curtain to the execution chamber went up at the scheduled 6 p.m. start time, Heath was already strapped down with an IV inserted in his arm. Asked by the warden if Heath had any final statement, he said, ”I’m sorry. That’s all I can say. Thank you.”\n\nAs the drugs were being administered, Heath showed little outward reaction, closing his eyes and then appearing to fall asleep before becoming motionless. A medic was called in about 8 minutes after the drugs began, and Heath was declared dead 2 minutes after that.\n\nIt was the state’s first execution of 2026 and followed a record 19 executions in Florida last year. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis oversaw more executions in a single year in 2025 than any other Florida governor since the death penalty was reinstated in the U.S. in 1976. The previous Florida record was eight executions set in 2014.\n\nAccording to court records, Heath and his brother Kenneth Heath met Sheridan at a Gainesville bar in May 1989. After hanging out at the bar for some time, the three men agreed to go somewhere else to smoke marijuana.\n\nAt some point, the brothers plotted to rob the other man, investigators said. Ronald Heath drove the group to a remote area, where Kenneth Heath pulled a handgun on Sheridan. The man initially refused to give the brothers anything, and Kenneth Heath shot Sheridan in the chest.\n\nAs Sheridan emptied his pockets, Ronald Heath began kicking the man and stabbing him with a hunting knife, prosecutors said. Kenneth Heath then shot Sheridan twice in the head.\n\nThe brothers dumped Sheridan's body in a wooded area and returned to the Gainesville bar to take items from his rental car, according to the court record. It said the brothers made multiple purchases with Sheridan's credit cards the next day at a Gainesville mall.\n\nRonald Heath was arrested several weeks later at his home in Douglas, Georgia, after investigators connected him to the stolen credit cards. Officers recovered clothing purchased with the stolen cards, as well as Sheridan's watch, according to court records.\n\nKenneth Heath was also charged with Sheridan's murder, but was sentenced to life in prison as part of a plea agreement.\n\nMore than a dozen family members of victims of Heath's crimes witnessed his execution.\n\nWhen Heath was 16, he was convicted of killing teenager Michael Green, and served 10 years in prison.\n\nDays after Sheridan's death, authorities also found the body of Tony Hammett. Heath was charged with Hammett's killing, but the case never went to trial.\n\nSheridan's brother, Thomas Sheridan, said during a news conference following the execution that his family, as well as the families of Green and Hammett, had been waiting for this day for more than three decades.\n\n“Tonight, Ronald Palmer Heath was released to the custody of his new parole officer. As far as I’m concerned, any forgiveness is between him and God,\" Thomas Sheridan said.\n\nThe Florida Supreme Court denied appeals filed by Ronald Heath last week. His attorneys had argued that Florida corrections officials had mismanaged its own death penalty protocols, that the state's secretive clemency process blocked due process, that Heath's incarceration as a juvenile stunted his brain development and that jurors did not recommend the death penalty unanimously.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Heath's appeal.\n\nA total of 47 people were executed in the U.S. in 2025. Florida led the way with a flurry of death warrants signed by DeSantis. Alabama, South Carolina and Texas tied for second with five executions each that year.\n\nTwo more Florida executions have already been scheduled for later this month and next month. Melvin Trotter, 65, is scheduled to die on Feb. 24, and the execution of Billy Leon Kearse, 53, is set to follow exactly a week later on March 3.\n\nAll Florida executions are carried out via lethal injection using a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart, according to the Department of Corrections.",

    "title": "It turns out that Joe Biden really did crush Americans’ dreams for the future. Just look at how the vibe changed 5 years ago",
    "description": "More than four in 10 Americans don’t anticipate “high-quality life” in five years’ time, the lowest mark in nearly 20 years",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump rode Americans’ gloom about inflation and the economy to a surprising reelection in 2024. Then, a year later, upstart Democrats including New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani rode concerns about “affordability” to an even more surprising sweep.\n\nIt turns out the inflation wave of 2021–23 was a really big deal, according to the mother of American opinion polling.\n\nA long-running Gallup poll found the percentage of U.S. adults who anticipate a high-quality life within the next five years slumped to 59.2%, its lowest share since the organization began asking this question nearly two decades ago.\n\nThe poll—based on data collected over four quarterly measurements in 2025 among 22,125 U.S. adults—revealed a notable decline in sentiment, measuring a 3.5-percentage-point drop-off from 2024.\n\n“If you look at the optimism metric for future life, that really came down a lot from 2021 to 2023, and that corresponds really closely with the worst of the inflation crisis,” Dan Witters, research director of the Gallup national health and well-being index, told Fortune. “The economic pressures of being able to afford things like food and fuel and gas and health care—that really can have a deleterious effect.”\n\nMoreover, the study found the number of Americans who rate both their current and future lives high enough to be characterized as “thriving” dropped to 48%, down more than 11 points from a high in June 2021, and the sixth-lowest rating out of all 176 measurements taken since 2008. The last time the rating dropped below its current level was in April 2020, the month after the COVID pandemic first hit the U.S.\n\nThe results come as a confluence of factors have impeded the American way of life. Over the last several years, inflation, domestic conflict, economic uncertainty, and political upheaval have made many Americans feel more pessimistic about the future. Americans’ confidence in finding a job has hit rock-bottom, and homeownership has grown increasingly unattainable for younger generations. All this as the expanding K-shaped economy is leaving millions of Americans in the dust.\n\n“Their optimism for the future is now eroding,” Witters said. “[It’s] eroding at a rate that’s kind of significantly greater than what we find with how they evaluate their current lives.”\n\nYet even as inflation cooled in 2024, dropping to 2.5% year over year that August, Americans remained pessimistic. Witters attributed that persistent pessimism to political partisanship.\n\n“In 2025, the steep drop among Democrats coupled with no change this time among Republicans don’t cancel each other out. And so you have that real net negative in the overall U.S. total.”\n\nWitters mentions it’s common for life ratings to swing dramatically among political parties when control of the White House changes. Still, expectations for a high-quality life dropped off significantly among Democrats, a 7.6 percentage point decline in future life ratings from 2024. For context, Republicans’ sentiment dropped 5.9 percentage points after Biden assumed office in 2021 while Democrats’ optimism rose 4.4 points.\n\nYet even among Republicans, optimism rose just 0.9 points last year. And Independents’ optimism fell 1.5 points.\n\n“I think that to the extent that that kind of partisanship can kind of influence the overall national numbers, clearly that’s happening here,” Witters said.\n\nGallup asked respondents to choose a step on a ladder numbered from zero to 10 that best represented their quality of life, where zero indicated the worst possible life and 10 indicated the best possible life.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "description": "Abdukodir Khusanov endured a nightmare debut for Manchester City but has since recovered to become a mainstay in the team.",
    "fullText": "Abdukodir Khusanov endured a nightmare debut for Manchester City, producing a comedy of errors inside his first four minutes of action for the club.\n\nAfter an awful mistake from the £33m signing gifted Chelsea the opening goal in the game in January 2025, he was booked soon after and it was an uphill journey for him from that desperate start.\n\nFormer Manchester United defender Gary Neville said he \"felt like crying for the lad\" after that game, and following City's Champions League defeat at Real Madrid the following month, ex-England goalkeeper Paul Robinson said, external Khusanov had been \"like a rabbit in the headlights\".\n\nBut with City challenging on all four fronts this season, the centre-back has recovered from those early setbacks to emerge as a mainstay in the backline, with manager Pep Guardiola calling him a \"top-level player\".\n\n'Tank', 'train' & 'monster' - the rise of Man City signing Khusanov\n\nThe 21-year-old has experienced a remarkable rise from playing in Belarus' top-flight to reaching the Premier League within three years.\n\nA trailblazer for his country, he became the first player from Uzbekistan to feature in England's top division and will represent his nation at the World Cup in the summer.\n\nHe has played 22 times in all competitions for City this season and featured in the impressive victories over Manchester United and Newcastle, as well as Sunday's comeback win over champions Liverpool at Anfield.\n\nGuardiola enthused about him afterwards, saying \"what a game he played\" against Mohamed Salah and Hugo Ekitike, although he was substituted in the second half after colliding with City goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.\n\nKhusanov's main asset is his speed - he has clocked 22mph this season, the sixth-highest for a Premier League defender, with Wolves' Jackson Tchatchoua leading the way on 23.2mph.\n\nWith 17 tackles and 18 interceptions this term, Khusanov ranks second for City players on both metrics, having had to step up amid the absence of Ruben Dias, Josko Gvardiol and John Stones at various stages.\n\nKhusanov arrived in Manchester with limited English and when asked about possible language difficulties on Tuesday, Guardiola replied: \"He doesn't speak like William Shakespeare but he's getting better and better.\n\n\"He understands what we want and every time he is getting better. He is so intelligent.\"\n\nKhusanov is naturally reserved and instead does his talking on the pitch with a no-nonsense approach.\n\nSuch has been the improvement in his form this season that he claimed City's player of the month award for January.\n\nThat said, it is true to say that Khusanov can still cause some nervousness among City fans when in possession, perhaps with flashbacks to his first game.\n\nHe is still young and raw, but Guardiola has no doubts about the player's bright future.\n\n\"Normally when a player has physicality, it means he does not have to use the head,\" said the Spaniard. \"He has both. That's why on the ball he is getting better and it always encourages me that he will improve.\n\n\"I think he can improve - he is always open minded. I have said Manchester City have a player and a central defender for many, many years.\"\n\nKhusanov's standout quality is his pace, which is invaluable in the modern game.\n\nCity's assistant coach Pep Lijnders has helped employ some of the sport's most aggressive out-of-possession tactics throughout his career. His influence has bled into City's system this season, with the Blues looking to catch opponents offside.\n\nThis high-risk approach is made less risky when playing Khusanov. His pace helps him step up to catch opponents offside, or defend running towards his own goal when teams play direct through balls.\n\nHe is averaging 17.85 sprints per 90 minutes, the most of any central defender in the league; more than being quick, he is using that pace often and to good effect.\n\nThe best teams boast technical quality that improves their ability to build out from the back and defending teams now have the problem of whether they leave an extra defender back for defensive solidity or not - as doing so means they press with one fewer player.\n\nKhusanov's pace and reading of the game enables him to make up ground when City press with one fewer player higher up. This prevents opponents from finding a way out of City's press.\n\nAs much as speed is key to his game, Guardiola has made sure to point out that Khusanov is more than just brawn.\n\nQuick defenders often encourage opponents to run at them, knowing they can beat them for pace - but Khusanov's intelligence shines when it comes to deciding when to engage in duels versus when to back off.\n\nHis aggressive nature is the source of debate, but it allows him to be an impressive high-line defender, preventing attackers from holding the ball up. Khusanov cleverly backs off, however, if there is another player making a run into a more dangerous area - providing much-needed cover.",

    "fullText": "World number two Rory McIlroy says the Players Championship has \"more of an identity\" than the US PGA Championship but does not believe the tournament should become men's golf's fifth major.\n\nThe 36-year-old, from County Down in Northern Ireland, became just the sixth man to win each of the sport's four majors - the Masters, US Open, Open Championship and US PGA Championship - in April when he earned a first Green Jacket at Augusta National to complete the career Grand Slam.\n\nThe Players, held in March at TPC Sawgrass, has long been nicknamed 'the fifth major', and used to boast of the strongest field in golf, although has been without a number of big names since the start of LIV Golf in 2022.\n\nLast week, the tournament began a promotional campaign for this year's edition with the tagline 'March is going to be major'.\n\nWhile women's golf already has five majors, McIlroy does not feel the men's game needs to expand its own designation.\n\n\"Look, I'd love to have seven majors instead of five, that sounds great,\" McIlroy said referencing his two previous Players Championships to go alongside his five majors.\n\n\"I think the Players is one of the best golf tournaments in the world. I don't think anyone disputes that or argues that. I think from a player perspective it's amazing. I think from an on-site fan experience it's amazing. It's an amazing golf course, location, venue.\n\n\"But I'm a traditionalist, I'm a historian of the game. We have four major championships. If you want to see what five major championships looks like, look at the women's game. I don't know how well that's went for them.\"\n\nMcIlroy also called for the US PGA Championship to be moved back to August.\n\nHis PGA titles in 2012 and 2014 came when the tournament was held in August, but since 2019, it has been staged in May in between the Masters and US Open.\n\nWhen it was the final major of the year, it was branded 'glory's last shot', and McIlroy believes \"it needs to go back to August\" to regain that identity.\n\n\"The Players, it doesn't need to be anything else. I would say it's got more of an identity than the PGA Championship does at the minute,\" he added before making his 2026 PGA Tour debut with the defence of his Pebble Beach Pro-Am title on Thursday.\n\n\"So from an identity standpoint, I think the Players has got it nailed. It stands on its own without the label, I guess.\"\n\n'Doesn't seem fair' - Rahm criticises LIV rankings call\n\nPGA Tour success vindicates rejecting LIV - Rose",

    "description": "With the 2026 Super League season about to kick off on its 30th anniversary, BBC Sport explains what to look out for during a bumper World Cup year.",
    "fullText": "Four months on since Hull KR wrapped up a clean sweep of trophies in 2025, Super League makes its return as it celebrates its 30th birthday.\n\nThree new clubs join an expanded league, there have been signings aplenty, another trip to Las Vegas coming up and it is a World Cup year too.\n\nBut what should you watch out for as the 'greatest game' makes its comeback for another season?\n\nBBC Sport has taken a look at some things to focus on when the curtain opens on the 2026 campaign on Thursday.\n\nThirty years after the inaugural Super League season got under way with 12 teams, this year the competition has expanded to 14 sides.\n\nIt is the first time since 2014 the league has operated with 14 teams having previously dipped down to 12 from the 2015 season.\n\nWith Salford dropping out at the end of last season, the league will welcome three clubs - two of which have played in the top flight before.\n\nBradford Bulls and Toulouse Olympique have both featured in Super League in the past but newcomers York Knights will make their debut this season as the sport continues to expand outside its traditional heartlands.\n\nKnights, whose women's team York Valkyrie have enjoyed plenty of success in the Women's Super League, were selected to join rugby league's top flight by an independent panel along with Toulouse, who come back to the top table following a one-season stint in 2022.\n\nThe panel judged applications against each club's financial performance in 2025, as well as their financial performance and sustainability forecasts for 2026 to 2028 and their ability to \"field a competitive team in 2026 and beyond\".\n\nHeadlined by the high-profile signing of Paul Vaughan from Warrington, York have ushered in a total of 14 new faces as they aim to hit the ground running in their maiden top-flight campaign.\n\nToulouse, meanwhile, welcome Wigan's Tyler Dupree on a season-long loan, hoping to establish themselves alongside Catalans as the league's French representation.\n\nSuper League to expand to 14 teams from 2026\n\nYork and Toulouse to play in expanded Super League\n\nBradford replace Salford in Super League for 2026\n\nTo those of a certain vintage, Bradford Bulls and Super League success are synonymous.\n\nThe club dominated the early Super League era, clinching four league titles and two Challenge Cups during their late 1990s and early 2000s heyday.\n\nFormerly a dominant force, the club lost their top-flight status in 2015 with Wigan Warriors, Leeds Rhinos and St Helens taking it in turns to dominate after Bradford ran out of steam.\n\nDuring their 11-year absence, the club has been plagued with financial troubles and had a stint in the former third-tier League One but, off the back of last season's grading system, they return to Super League.\n\nIconic head coach Brian Noble came back to the club last season and steered them to third in the Championship but they will enter the 2026 campaign under the stewardship of highly-rated former Salford coach Kurt Haggerty.\n\n\"The work we've done leading to round one has been probably more stressful than what's coming ahead,\" Haggerty told BBC Radio Leeds.\n\n\"We've had a lot of stress before we kicked a ball so if I can remain as calm as I have done up to now, I think we'll be ok and I'll be ok.\n\n\"There's a lot of good people around me like Brian Noble who I can rely on and get advice from if I need it.\"\n\nBradford, Toulouse and York have all had to piece together their respective squads for the 2026 season from October onwards, meaning it has been a mad dash to the line for the newcomers to contest the season.\n\nAsked what his ambition was for the coming campaign, Haggerty added: \"I think if we come away from this year with a load of respect, I'll be happy with that.\"\n\nThe expansion to 14 teams means the previously maligned loop fixtures are no more.\n\nThe format was introduced when the league was reduced to 12 sides and ensured that every team played 27 games over the course of a regular season.\n\nIn order for that to happen, however, four of those matches would be so-called loop fixtures where some clubs would face each other again during the regular season based on the final league table from the previous campaign.\n\nThis structure would occasionally lead to some teams having a pretty lopsided campaign - as was the case with St Helens last season, who virtually had a free hit against a chaotic Salford Red Devils side on three occasions while other clubs arguably had a more difficult run-in.\n\nThis led to criticism from many a coach over many a season but returning to a 14-team set-up means the regular season will now consist of 13 home games, 13 away and one Magic Weekend fixture played at a neutral venue - which this year takes place at Everton's Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\nOne side who will not feature in Super League this term are former Grand Finalists Salford.\n\nThe formerly named Red Devils endured a torrid 2025 campaign due to financial issues and frequently fielded youthful sides who were on the receiving end of some demoralising drubbings.\n\nThe club lost their place in Super League due to the end-of-season gradings and were later placed into liquidation by the High Court in December, which plunged its future into doubt.\n\nHowever, former player Mason Caton-Brown led a consortium to take over the club - now running under the Salford RLFC moniker - as they frantically put together the shell of a side to contest the 2026 Championship season in a matter of weeks after being given the go ahead from the Rugby Football League.\n\nHull KR come into the 2026 season off the back of a campaign which saw them win a clean sweep of Challenge Cup, League Leaders' Shield and the Super League Grand Final.\n\nThat success has shattered the glass ceiling as Willie Peters' side muscled their way in to the northern hemisphere elite, becoming only the fifth club in Super League history to win a Grand Final.\n\nBut will their dominance be tested? After all, Wigan came into last season off the back of a historic quadruple of trophies, yet they could not mount a challenge against Hull KR and came away at the end of the season empty-handed.\n\nSt Helens, Leeds and Leigh Leopards have recruited well as they look to dethrone the Robins, who also have a trip to Las Vegas to face the Rhinos and next week's World Club Challenge against National Rugby League premiers Brisbane Broncos to contend with in a packed calendar in the early part of the season.\n\nThere has been some turnover at the Robins, with Jared Waerea-Hargreaves and Micky McIlorum retiring after October's showpiece, but the club have kept the spine of what has made them so successful in recent seasons.\n\nTalismanic half-back Mikey Lewis signed a huge five-year deal before the 2025 season ended and balancing the old and new is crucial to inspiring success in the future, KR forward Dean Hadley said.\n\n\"You look at any successful team, whatever sport that might be and they always have a core group of players and people, which includes the staff,\" he told BBC Radio Humberside.\n\n\"When you've got a group where the majority have been together, you build relationships and connections and you get used to each other.\n\n\"Off the back of that it's important to bring in a few new additions and new energy. The boys that have come in have been really good and added to it but the majority of us have been together now for two or three years and hopefully we can carry on.\"\n\nWhat adds some extra spice to the season is the fact there is a World Cup at the end of it, as England's best and brightest aim to put themselves in the picture for a spot in the squad that will travel to Australia in October.\n\nWith Peters \"keen\" to have talks for the role of England boss after the departure of Shaun Wane, how many of his KR cohort will be on the plane down under later this year?",

    "description": "Liverpool have won just once in the Premier League in 2026 - so will they stick with Arne Slot, who took them to the title last season?",
    "fullText": "Arne Slot afforded himself a little smile when he admitted that this was the toughest season in his career \"by a mile\" on Tuesday.\n\nNo matter what Slot achieves across the rest of his managerial days, this campaign has pushed the Dutchman to new limits.\n\nAfter romping to the Premier League title in his first season in charge at Liverpool, the second has seen Slot and his side face a barrage of \"setbacks\", \"hits\" and \"bad luck\" as he mentioned during his news conference on Tuesday. More on that later.\n\nThe raw numbers do not make for good reading. Since winning their first five league matches at the start of the season, Liverpool have taken just 24 points from their next 20 games.\n\nFor context, Roy Hodgson won 25 points from 20 games before he was sacked as Liverpool boss in 2010-11.\n\nIn 2026 alone, Liverpool have won just one of their seven league games and earlier this season, nine defeats in 12 games was their worst run of form in 71 years.\n\n\"They've been really bad champions\", was the verdict of Roy Keane on Sky Sports on Sunday, after Liverpool fell to their eighth league defeat of the season.\n\nPut simply, such numbers are not good enough for the reigning champions, particularly given their £450m summer spend, and Slot conceded as much when he said it would be not be acceptable if Liverpool failed to qualify for the Champions League.\n\nThat Liverpool are still in with a chance of qualifying is primarily due to the fact that rivals such as Chelsea and Manchester United have gone through torrid spells too.\n\nBoth those clubs have sacked their managers this season after a breakdown in the relationship between the coach and senior figures.\n\nIn Slot's case, there is serious credit in the bank. The 47-year-old is the only coach alongside Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola and Liverpool predecesor Jurgen Klopp to win the title since 2017-18.\n\nIt's also worth noting that in 2020-21, the season after Liverpool won the league under Klopp, they were eighth after 28 games but Klopp's future was never truly in doubt. They won 26 points from their last 30 available and ended up finishing third.\n\nHowever, in the 2022-23 season Klopp's side failed to qualify for the Champions League - something Slot says would \"not be acceptable\" this term.\n\nAsked what impact such a scenario would have on his own position, Slot replied: \"That is again a difficult question for me to answer because I don't decide on my future.\n\n\"The only thing I do know is that it happened before, and ­recently, and it didn't affect the future of that manager. But that doesn't guarantee anything, of course.\n\n\"In general, [with] managers, especially at this club - maybe somewhere else it is mainly, but not only, about results - they also look at the progress the players make, the progress the team makes, the circumstances are sometimes taken into account.\n\n\"That is not at all clubs, but I think I am working at a club that does look at those things. As it has shown in the past when the club did not qualify for the Champions League.\"\n\nTraditionally, Liverpool are not a club that sacks coaches and the understanding is that the Anfield hierarchy is behind Slot, until the end of the season at least.\n\nLast week, an in-house roundtable chat between Slot, sporting director Richard Hughes and CEO Billy Hogan was posted across Liverpool's social channels.\n\nAlthough it was filmed in mid-January, the video showcased a strong relationship between all. Hughes was of course instrumental in Slot's appointment and getting rid of him would mean admitting that it didn't work out.\n\nYet there is a clear awareness that performances and results must improve and Slot is aware of the pressure, both internally and externally.\n\nBoos aren't exactly the norm at Anfield but they have been heard more frequently this season.\n\nAway from the cameras, Slot is seen as calm, consistent and level-headed, but admissions that he finds it \"hard to hear\" claims that Liverpool's football has been \"dull\" speak of a man that is battling hard, and who is insistent his side can do \"something special\".\n\nThere is certainly mitigation for Liverpool's struggles. The death of Diogo Jota last summer was tragic and last week former Liverpool keeper Caoimhín Kelleher said that meant the football side of things was not important this season for Liverpool as players dealt with his loss.\n\nSlot said the meeting he held with the players after Jota's funeral was one of the most difficult things he's done in his life.\n\nNo one at the club will use Jota's passing as an excuse for their form but the impact of such a tragedy must be considered.\n\nLiverpool have also faced an injury crisis, including the long-term absences of Giovanni Leoni, Conor Bradley and Alexander Isak, while going through a squad transition that has focused on technical footballers, rather than physical signings.\n\nThe feeling behind that strategy is that long-term, the game will move towards a focus on possession, rather than the emphasis on physicality seen this season.\n\nThe form of key players dipping hasn't helped either, so a range of factors have combined to leave Liverpool where they are.\n\nRegardless, given the quality of players at their disposal, it is widely accepted that the defending champions are indeed \"not performing to Liverpool's standard\", as Slot has said.\n\nHis suggestion on Tuesday that Liverpool have only been outplayed in three halves this season was far-fetched, however.\n\nWhen a team loses eight and draws six out of 25 games, such a claim doesn't stand up.\n\n\"The question is are we unlucky or is it part of who we are? That is something we can only find out in the upcoming three to four months,\" Slot said, when asked about the bad luck his side have had.\n\nLiverpool still have the chance of silverware in the FA Cup and Champions League, but the minimum aim for the rest of the campaign will be to qualify for the Champions League next season.\n\nTheir financial model is based upon sustainability and there will be serious implications if they miss out.\n\nLike that Klopp side of 2020-21, they need to be \"close to perfection\" as Slot said from now on, starting with the trip to Sunderland on Wednesday.\n\nOf course, there is an elephant in the room after Xabi Alonso left his position as Real Madrid manager, with the former Liverpool midfielder touted as a possible replacement for Slot.\n\nHowever, given no manager in Liverpool's history has a better win percentage (61%) than Slot, it is understandable why, for now at least, he retains the club's backing.\n\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "\"It's all about the fingertips\" replies Crishan Kalugamage with a wink when asked about the similarities between bowling leg-spin and making pizzas.\n\nKalugamage moved from Sri Lanka to Lucca in Tuscany as a 15-year-old and is one of five home-based players in Italy's 15-man squad for the T20 World Cup.\n\nA sporty kid, Kalugamage made friends competing in athletics and then started playing some amateur cricket near his adopted hometown. His natural talent for the game set him apart and he was soon scouted to play for Roma Cricket Club, one of the oldest in the country.\n\nThe now 34-year-old is one of many players in the Italian squad who have known sacrifice to get where they are today, namely playing in front of thousands of people at famous cricketing stadiums such as Kolkata's Eden Gardens and Mumbai's Wankhede. A global audience of millions watching at home.\n\nKalugamage's job as a pizza maker often came second to playing cricket. \"I lost a lot of jobs,\" he says ruefully, \"Sunday is a very busy day, lots of bosses aren't keen on you not working because you are playing cricket.\"\n\n\"Crish is a very dangerous weapon\" Italy's head coach, John Davison, says on a separate call. \"He can spin it sharply both ways and he will have the element of surprise, hardly anyone in the tournament will have ever faced him.\"\n\nDavison knows his rotations - he is also known as 'The Spin Whisperer'. He has spent the last decade and a half as an in-demand spin coach. Nathan Lyon called Davison the \"best spin coach in the world\" and has worked with him since his teens.\n\nHis dough-spinning days behind him, it'll be Kalugamage's fast googly, rather than a Sloppy Giuseppe, that troubles the batters of Group C (England, Scotland, Nepal and West Indies) who are set to face him.\n\nNone of the 15 squad members were born in Italy and only a few are fluent in the language.\n\nSeveral players hold Italian passports or qualify because of a relative, and some people have baulked at the Italian Cricket Federation casting their net so wide rather than concentrating on developing more homegrown players.\n\nSouth African born and South African capped (six ODIs and 16 T20Is between 2017 and 2021) all-rounder JJ Smuts will play for Italy during the tournament by dint of his marriage but has never even stepped foot in the country.\n\n\"People can have their opinion but we've got a real togetherness,\" says captain Wayne Madsen, speaking before his side's opening match against Scotland on Monday, which saw him dislocate his shoulder and his team soundly beaten.\n\nThe 42-year-old South African born batter is club captain at Derbyshire and has a wealth of experience with teams around the globe. Even so, this group of players has had a real effect on him.\n\n\"That heritage and the journeys that guys have gone on to get here, there's a bond which is pretty hard to describe outside of the feeling that we get as a group,\" said Madsen.\n\n\"It really is probably our biggest strength. Everyone's got a story to tell in terms of how they got to this position and everyone's is unique. Whether it is guys who have grown up in Italy or guys with grandparents who moved away many years ago. We've had some really powerful conversations, it has really bonded us.\"\n\nFor Madsen and Davison, success on the pitch in this tournament is part of a wider plan to build on the growing cricketing roots in Italy.\n\n\"We want to win games and we know and believe that we can. If we can finish in the top eight, that'll change the lives of a lot of our cricketers and put Italian cricket on the map\" says Madsen.\n\n\"I think for us, the main thing is leaving a legacy in Italy and the platform to develop the game further in the country.\"\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.\n\nFor some of the squad, the prospect of playing in front of a large crowd will be something of an alien prospect. Davison mentions that the players had a training session inside Chennai's MA Chidambaram Stadium a few days earlier and it was the first time that the Pakistani born and Italian raised left-arm seamer Hassan Ali had stepped foot inside a cricket stadium of any kind.\n\nThe players have been working with Dr Andrew Hooton, Head of the School of Sports and Exercises Science at the University of Derby, in order to prepare themselves. Hooton has worked with Madsen and Micky Arthur at Derbyshire and also with Burton Albion Football Club.\n\n\"Some of the squad definitely haven't had experience of playing in a big stadium, under lights with huge crowds\" says Hooton, \"One of the things I've been working with them on is being able to perform their skills and maintain their basics in this heightened scenario.\n\n\"We've done some work around 'centering'. Like when you see Ronaldo before he takes a free-kick or penalty, he closes his eyes and does a whole body breath. It allows for attentional focus but also helps to guard against nerves and anxiety. It's physical as well as mental.\"\n\nDavison mentions the 33,000 seater Wankhede stadium in Mumbai is sold out for their second game against Nepal.\n\n\"The ICC give us about 75 tickets for friends and family, that leaves a heck of a lot of supporters for us to win over, but we'll be giving it our best shot,\"\n\n\"We have a platform to take cricket further, to take it to another level,\" adds Madsen. \"We've got the players to make that happen and we're dreaming high. We aren't just here to make up the numbers, we can take sides down.\"\n\nSat next to his captain as he says these words, pizza maker Kalugamage smiles and surreptitiously flicks his fingers. The next part of the journey about to begin.\n\nMadsen dislocates shoulder in Italy's World Cup bow\n\nLeask & Munsey star as Scotland beat debutants Italy\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

The combined scores of both segments will decide the medals.\n\nWhile the free dance allows couples greater freedom in their routines, the rhythm dance contains required elements for more direct comparison.\n\nThe judges determined the French pair to have a better technical score on their step sequence than the Americans - hence their slight advantage.\n\nThe objectivity of figure skating judging is a controversy as old as the Olympics and a story for another day.\n\nSo plenty of intrigue on the ice - and that's nothing compared to the drama off it.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nFournier Baudry competed for Canada and Denmark before being rushed into French citizenship last year in order to find the champion a new partner.\n\nIt comes after Cizeron split with Gabriella Papadakis, with whom he won the Beijing 2022 title, five world titles and his skating partner since they were children.\n\nThe split has been extremely acrimonious. Earlier this year, she released a memoir describing an \"unbalanced\" relationship with Cizeron in which she said she felt \"under his grip\" and accused him of being \"controlling\" and \"demanding\".\n\nCizeron called this a \"smear campaign\" and \"false information\", and is taking legal action. Papadakis, who has worked in figure skating broadcasting since 2024, was fired, external as an analyst for NBC before these Games because of a \"conflict of interest\" as a result of her memoir.\n\nAs for Fournier Beaudry, she was not available to step in as Cizeron's partner by chance.\n\nShe was previously partnered with Canadian skater Nikolaj Sorensen, with whom she is also in a relationship.\n\nBut in 2025 Sorensen was given a six-year suspension, external following a sexual assault allegation dating from 2012. The allegation relates to his behaviour towards an American skater coach and does not involve Fournier Beaudry.\n\nSorensen has called the allegations \"false\", while Fournier Beaudry has publicly supported her boyfriend.\n\nIn the Netflix documentary Glitter and Gold, which follows the international figure skating tour, she said: \"I know my boyfriend 100%. I know him.\"\n\nHer stance has been criticised, external by the anonymous complainant, who said the comments \"create a dangerous environment for skaters who need to report abuse\".\n\nFournier Beaudry gained French citizenship in November and has since refused to comment further on Sorensen.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "From housewives with brooms to Olympic lifters - step inside the world-leading National Curling Academy in Stirling.",
    "fullText": "One of the first things you notice is the number of cameras. They're everywhere, trained on the four ice sheets at a variety of angles. Some fixed. Some swooping down on cables. Others manoeuvred on long arms.\n\nCoaches clad in anoraks and armed with laptops discuss data posted on large screens, their conversations punctuated by the clunk of granite on granite as Team GB's curlers hone their games on the perfectly prepared ice.\n\nThis is the National Curling Academy in Stirling. From the outside, it's just a public leisure centre on the edge of town, with sprightly pensioners staying flexible in aerobics classes and excitable kids in for swimming lessons.\n\nBut slipping past the joyful chaos in reception and through a side door takes you to another world. A world in which British Curling leads the way.\n\n\"We hope we are a bit ahead of the curve in our behaviours around nutrition, physical performance, conditioning, innovation and technology, but it's getting competitive,\" says British Curling's head of performance services Nikki Gibson.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nIt's now 24 years since Rhona Martin delivered the Stone of Destiny in Salt Lake City, watched by millions of rapt viewers at dark o'clock in the UK.\n\nBritain's first Winter Olympics gold in 18 years had been won by a group of Scottish housewives in an odd little sport. 'Look at them on the ice with their daft wee brooms…' was the perception by some.\n\nThat derogatory view wasn't correct then and it is even further from the truth now.\n\nThe 10 curlers who are representing Team GB in Cortina right now lift weights like sprinters, strategise like chess players, and fuel like Tour de France cyclists.\n\nEvery weekday morning, the athletes on the GB programme will start training at 08:30. Each day includes two two-hour ice sessions and one in the gym.\n\nAcross a week, three of those gym sessions are strength-based and two conditioning. Most will add another at the weekend, just to keep themselves right.\n\nThey are supervised - no sitting on a bench next to the weights while doomscrolling for this lot - and are specifically designed with curling in mind.\n\n\"It's Olympic lifts we're doing - clean and jerk, snatches, squats, the lot,\" says Hammy McMillan, whose gold medal-tipped men's rink start their campaign on Wednesday. \"And we're using ski machines, rowers, and assault bikes to really condition our bodies.\"\n\n\"The numbers we put up, I don't think people would expect them,\" adds Bobby Lammie, who is credited alongside McMillan as having changed the physicality expected of sweepers.\n\n\"It's allowed us to separate ourselves slightly from the rest of the world.\"\n\nSimilar can be said of the women's game, where 2022 gold medallist Jen Dodds - one of the world's best with a brush - is lifting just as much as some of the men. \"More than me, to be fair,\" admits men's vice-skip Grant Hardie.\n\n\"Jen is incredible in the gym,\" says Team GB women's skip Rebecca Morrison, who takes a slightly different view of the gym work.\n\n\"You need a lot of core strength to even stay upright on the ice,\" she says.\n\n\"Maybe we're not flinging ourselves off massive jumps or sliding down a track at 80 miles per hour, but it's a lot harder than people realise to even keep your balance.\"\n\nWhen you consider the schedule of curling competitions, the fitness regime begins to make more sense.\n\nDuring the Olympics, for example, Mouat will play for 17 consecutive days - often more than once - should the men reach the semi-finals as expected. Mixed doubles partner Dodds, at least, will get a day off before the women's event starts.\n\nThen layer up the travelling during the season - five or six times to Canada or the United States as well as shorter European jaunts and occasionally to Asia - and suddenly the demands look daunting.\n\nTo do it and still perform, you need to be fit. And you need to be properly fuelled.\n\nBritish Curling employs a nutritionist who successfully argued that there is no reason curlers should not approach food in the same way as a Tour de France team.\n\nAnd while it's unlikely cyclists are munching the cereal bars and sweets favoured by the curlers when on the ice, many of the same principles are the same.\n\n\"Our nutritionists would never say 'you can't eat a Mars bar', but I want the athletes to not want to eat the Mars bar,\" says Gibson. \"That's the culture we're trying to create.\n\n\"One of our Paralympic athletes said our nutritionist is great because he realises he's a 40-year-old man who's not suddenly going to start eating salads.\n\n\"But he's managed to make little changes, like eating berries before going to bed at night to help with sleep.\n\n\"We're not looking at them being perfect 100% of the time - it's more looking at what are the areas we can really target that will make a difference to performance.\"\n\nThose areas include travel packs for curlers, which include high-protein snacks, hand sanitizers, face masks, chewing gum to increase saliva production and help avoid illness, and even dehydrated meals when going to Asia.\n\nAll of that falls within British Curling's 'what it takes to win' model.\n\nThat plan covers any number of areas, including performance lifestyle advisors - who can talk to the athletes financial planning and work-life balance - and psychology.\n\nThat can range from on-ice aspects such as pre-shot routines and performing under pressure, to team dynamics and communication.\n\nAnd every person is different, which heightens the challenge for Gibson and her team. Some, like men's alternate Kyle Waddell, like to \"just turn up, have a chat, and crack on\", but others need energy plans to manage their state of mind building up to matches.\n\n\"Not every athlete needs everything,\" Gibson says. \"And part of it is learning to not throw the kitchen sink at everybody, because some people just will not cope with that. And it's not how we get the best out of them.\n\n\"My job is to take away all the other stuff, all the stress, so the athletes can just focus on competing.\"\n\nSo how might things change for the next Olympic cycle? Gibson points to two key areas - physicality and artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile stopping short of conceding that today's curlers will look out of shape by the 2034 Games, she does believe sweepers will become bigger, stronger, and able to put more pressure on the brush.\n\n\"They will end up training like 400m sprinters,\" she says.\n\nBut it is in the area of AI that the most significant developments might come.\n\nBritish Curling already collects reams of data on training sessions and competitions, but how might that be better used to develop match strategies? Could they run simulations based on every conceivable shot played in an end, for example?\n\n\"We're looking for these guys to be making 96% of their shots, so one wrong shot can decide a game and be the difference between gold and silver,\" Gibson says. \"So every little innovation we make could matter a whole lot.\n\n\"This is the top of the sport, but I don't think people would expect us to do all this stuff. It's very much not just 'rock up, throw 32 stones and then go to the pub'.\n\n\"The hours, the number of stones thrown, bars lifted, protein shakes drunk, discussions with psychologists, mental strategies - these curlers work incredibly hard and we work hard with them to help them be the best.\"\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "James Milner is one game away from drawing level with Gareth Barry for most Premier League appearances, but has the record become a problem for Brighton?",
    "fullText": "Brighton midfielder James Milner is on the verge of equalling the all-time record for most Premier League appearances.\n\nThe current holder is former Aston Villa and Manchester City midfielder Gareth Barry, who played in 653 top-flight games.\n\nMilner could draw level with Barry on Wednesday evening when Brighton are at Villa and while Seagulls fans will no doubt celebrate such a moment, there will also likely be a sense of relief.\n\nThat's because for some supporters there is a feeling that the 40-year-old Milner has been making late appearances off the bench just to edge closer to the record and not necessarily for the benefit of the team.\n\n\"Not for the first time this season, Fabian Hurzeler made a substitution involving James Milner [against Fulham recently] which made little sense,\" Seagulls fan Scott McCarthy, of We are Brighton, said.\n\n\"That adds to the feeling, Milner is being gifted appearances so he can break the Premier League record.\n\n\"Hurzeler bringing on Milner at Anfield back in December, for example, was clearly done for another tick in the box and a nice reception from the home crowd.\n\n\"The token substitution did not go down well at the time.\"\n\nThere is little doubt that Milner has made some crucial contributions to the teams he has played for over the years.\n\nHe has won multiple Premier League titles with Manchester City and Liverpool, as well as the Champions League with the Reds.\n\nAs he's got older his influence on the pitch has understandably declined and this season he has made 14 Premier League appearances, with 12 of those from off the bench.\n\nHe has scored one goal and provided one assist, but for many of those who have either played alongside him or seen him in action, Milner offers much more than that.\n\n\"He is someone you can rely on,\" former England and Newcastle striker Alan Shearer said.\n\n\"If you have a James Milner in your squad you want to keep hold of him.\"\n\nFormer Manchester City defender Micah Richards added: \"He comes in training every single day.\n\n\"Sometimes you would come in and you want to relax, he was on you: 'Have you done this? Have you done that? What are you eating? What is your diet like?' But it was in a good way.\"\n\nMilner's 14 appearances this season make a total of 310 minutes on the pitch - meaning he is playing an average of 22 minutes per game.\n\nIn each of his last five Premier League appearances he has been sent on in the final 10 minutes, leading some fans to question whether his contribution has been worthwhile.\n\n\"As annoying as it was seeing a 39-year-old come on [against Liverpool] when Brighton had young players on the bench who could have benefited from the experience, at least the Albion were 2-0 down. It had no bearing on the outcome,\" added McCarthy.\n\n\"That was not the case against Fulham. Carlos Baleba had run the midfield with his best performance of the season. If Baleba was tiring, Hurzeler had Jack Hinshelwood on the bench to bring similar energy and drive.\n\n\"Instead, Hurzeler introduced Milner with 81 minutes played. 11 minutes later and Fulham scored their winner from a free-kick conceded in the exact area of the pitch Baleba had defended well all afternoon.\"\n\nThe frustration that some Brighton fans feel about Milner's late appearances off the bench - during which they perceive he offers little - will be compounded by the fact the Seagulls are on a poor run of form - with just one win in their last 12 Premier League games.\n\nJoe: I do not agree with the Milner vanity project. He should be a member of the coaching staff and not a member of the playing squad. We have younger, better options than him.\n\nBrian: Bringing Milner on towards the end of any game affects the balance of the midfield, usually causing unnecessary problems. I think the manager is just giving Milner an opportunity to beat record appearances rather than to improve team.\n\nGraham: Utter nonsense. Milner is brought on to shore up the midfield being a more defensive player and far more experienced than others.\n\nRozzer: Milner has represented the best of professionalism in English football for some time now. He has been a role model to thousands of youngsters in how he conducts himself on and off the pitch and he is deserving of this record. There will always be opportunity for him to do that this season without having too much impact on Albion. Well done Milner.\n\nShould Milner equal Barry's record on Wednesday evening, he will do so having played significantly fewer minutes than Barry did over his career.\n\nIn total, Barry spent 54,439 minutes on the pitch compared to 40,408 for Milner.\n\nHowever, it is about what you do with that time playing and Milner has certainly contributed plenty when he has played - scoring 56 goals and providing 90 assists.\n\nThose are statistics that compare favourably with Barry's record of 53 goals and 64 assists.\n\nMilner's longevity is certainly impressive.\n\nAlmost half the players to have played in the Premier League since it was formed in 1992-93 (5,094) have either played alongside or against Milner.\n\nSince his debut in the 2002-03 campaign, he has faced 99.9% of the 876 other players to have played at least 100 games in the last 24 Premier League seasons.\n\nThe only one of the above who has so far avoided facing Milner is Brentford's Nathan Collins, but that could change when the Bees play Brighton on 21 February.\n\nPlenty of Premier League managers have also become well acquainted with Milner over the decades. Including caretakers, he has made a Premier League appearance under 21 different managers – two more than any other player.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Tottenham sack Thomas Frank as head coach after a run of only two wins in 17 Premier League matches.",
    "fullText": "Thomas Frank has been sacked by Tottenham after just under eight months in charge following their dismal 2-1 defeat at home against Newcastle on Tuesday.\n\nSpurs are 16th in the Premier League and just five points above the relegation zone following a dreadful run of form.\n\nThe north London side are winless in their past eight Premier League games - their longest run without a victory since October 2008.\n\nThey have won just two of their past 17 league matches and picked up only 12 points in that time.\n\nTottenham said they had been \"determined to give Frank the time and support needed to build for the future together\", but recent results meant \"a change at this point is necessary\".\n\nFrank took over as head coach in June after Ange Postecoglou was sacked and signed a deal until 2028, but proved unable to notably improve the club's league form despite strong results in European competition.\n\nAgainst a mixed Premier League record of seven wins, eight draws and 11 defeats this season, the Dane led Spurs to automatic qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League by finishing fourth in the group stage.\n\nHowever, they are out of both domestic cup competitions, having been beaten by Newcastle in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup in October and Aston Villa in the FA Cup third round last month.\n\n\"Throughout his time at the club, Thomas has conducted himself with unwavering commitment, giving everything in his efforts to move the club forward,\" Tottenham said.\n\n\"We would like to thank him for his contribution and wish him every success in the future.\"\n\nWhy Frank at Tottenham was a gamble that ended in bitter failure\n\nReaction after Frank sacked as Tottenham boss\n\nWho should Spurs appoint next? Have your say\n\nDespite the loss to Newcastle, Frank still expected to be in charge for the north London derby against Arsenal on 22 February.\n\nAsked by TNT Sports on Tuesday night if his job was under threat, Frank said: \"I spoke to them [the owners] yesterday, so no.\n\n\"I understand the frustration and the easiest thing is to point at me. That's part of the job unfortunately.\n\n\"I will work day and night to turn this around but it is not just one person. There is no doubt we need to improve and I need to be part of that.\"\n\nSpurs were loudly booed after the defeats at home by Newcastle and fellow strugglers West Ham in the past few weeks.\n\nFrank was also taunted by his own fans with chants of \"you're getting sacked in the morning\" during the loss to West Ham and the 2-2 draw at Burnley that followed.\n\nAfter being booed off at half-time while 2-0 down to Manchester City, Frank's side responded to draw 2-2 at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nCaptain Cristian Romero was critical of Tottenham's board after that result, calling it \"disgraceful\" that the club only had 11 fit senior players available against City.\n\nThe Argentine then received a straight red card - his second of the season - against Manchester United on 7 February, who went on to win 2-0.\n\nSpurs won five, drew two and lost just one of their eight Champions League group stage matches - that defeat coming away to holders Paris St-Germain.\n\nHowever, their Premier League form has been largely poor since November, including a damaging 4-1 defeat by north London rivals Arsenal and a woeful 3-0 loss at relegation-threatened Nottingham Forest.\n\nLast month Frank said he felt trusted by the board but BBC Sport understands he was already under significant internal scrutiny and at least one member of the club's executive had raised the option of ending his reign.\n\nTottenham took just 10 points at home in the league under Frank, but had a better away record, claiming 19 points from 13 matches on the road.\n\nPrior to joining Tottenham, Frank spent seven years in charge of Brentford, guiding the Bees from the Championship to the Premier League in 2021.\n\nThe 52-year-old's tenure at Spurs started with a Uefa Super Cup defeat on penalties by PSG, with Spurs having booked their place in the match courtesy of winning the Europa League under Australian Postecoglou last season.\n\nTottenham beat Burnley, Manchester City and West Ham in their opening four league games, while also beating Villarreal in the Champions League. But they could not build on that start and Frank's style of play never won over fans.\n\nHe was hampered by extensive injury issues this season though, with Lucas Bergvall, Ben Davies, Richarlison, Rodrigo Bentancur, Mohammed Kudus, Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison among those out long term.\n\nSpurs are also without suspended captain Romero for the next three Premier League matches.\n\nFor weeks it has been a case of when, not if, Thomas Frank went, despite the club's ownership and leadership team being determined to give Frank a proper go at turning things round.\n\nUltimately they deemed that, under Frank, Spurs were more likely to career into oblivion than stop the rot.\n\nTottenham were desperate for this appointment to work - they believe Frank is a good manager who was dealt a rough hand.\n\nHowever, the toxicity amongst the fanbase and the meek performances on the pitch meant the club had no option but to act.\n\nMoving forward, an interim appointment until the end of the campaign makes sense, as the managerial landscape will change drastically at the end of the season.\n\nThe most obvious development will be the potential availability of former boss Mauricio Pochettino after the World Cup.\n\nThe USA head coach has made no secret of his desire to return to the club one day and supporters have made clear their wishes for him to return.\n\nIt seems like a perfect match, but Spurs will have to wait until after the World Cup to appoint Pochettino.\n\nAnd if it isn't Pochettino, the likes of Oliver Glasner, Andoni Iraola and Marco Silva will be available for nothing in the summer, while World Cup coaches Thomas Tuchel, Carlo Ancelotti and Julian Nagelsmann may also be obtainable.\n\nIn the meantime, Tottenham want Frank's immediate successor in place before the players return to training on Monday.\n\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Tottenham - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Thomas Frank's appointment by Tottenham was a gamble that ended in a storm of toxicity, writes Phil McNulty.",
    "fullText": "Thomas Frank's appointment as Tottenham head coach was a gamble by both parties. It was a gamble that failed - ending in a storm of toxicity.\n\nFrank left behind the stability and structure that underpinned his superb work at Brentford for the chaos of Spurs.\n\nIn place of the bedrock of Brentford owner Matthew Benham and director of football Phil Giles, Frank stepped into a high-stakes environment where even winning the Europa League - Spurs' first trophy in 17 years - did not spare predecessor Ange Postecoglou the sack.\n\nSpurs, in turn, were employing a head coach who had operated away from the sort of harsh spotlight and high expectations that awaited him in his new job. It was an ill-starred alliance, and Frank quickly found himself out of his depth.\n\nThis has been a joyless, miserable spell characterised by constant hostility aimed in Frank's direction by the vast majority of Spurs supporters, who decided very quickly he was not the man for them or the job he was required to do.\n\nFrank's dismissal will be a bitter disappointment for the popular, personable Dane, who earned his big opportunity at Spurs by taking Brentford into the Premier League and keeping them there for four seasons.\n\nFrank sacked by Spurs after eight months in charge\n\nReaction after Frank sacked as Tottenham boss\n\nFrank took over a side that finished 17th in the Premier League last season, having lost 22 games in the process.\n\nThey won the Europa League, but the true measure of a side is league position - and by that metric, Frank inherited a mediocre squad.\n\nThe notion this could be fully corrected - or even significantly transformed - in a matter of months is from the realms of fantasy.\n\nSpurs not only needed a change in team, but a change in culture. This must be factored into Frank's downfall.\n\nThe club has struggled to find anyone to match the popularity of Mauricio Pochettino, who was sacked six months after Spurs' defeat by Liverpool in the 2019 Champions League final.\n\nFrank's dismissal means he joins a list that includes proven winners Jose Mourinho and Antonio Conte, along with Nuno Espirito Santo and Postecoglou, who brought back long-awaited silverware last season.\n\nThe Dane ultimately could not get to grips with this most testing of tasks. It consumed him, ending with him looking a broken, beleaguered figure.\n\nFrank failed to produce a side with any sort of clear identity, dragged down by muddled thinking and, when it mattered, a safety-first approach.\n\nWhen the history of Frank's time at Spurs is written, defeats at home by Chelsea and at Arsenal in the north London derby will assume something close to notoriety.\n\nIn statistical terms, they were two of the most impotent attacking displays by any Premier League team this season. Spurs generated 0.1 xG at home in their 1-0 loss to Chelsea, then just 0.07 xG in the 4-1 reverse at Arsenal.\n\nIt was Frank's timid approach - almost as much as the loss - that drew such fierce criticism after the game at Arsenal - a five-man defence effectively a damage-limitation exercise that allowed the Gunners to win with ease.\n\nThe fact Eberechi Eze - a player Spurs wanted but allowed Arsenal to steal in and beat them to a £60m deal - scored a magnificent hat-trick only added to the pain and embarrassment.\n\nWhile the defeat at Arsenal will have hurt Spurs fans more, it was the loss to Chelsea that was arguably more worrying, especially as it was at home.\n\nOnly a combination of wastefulness from the visitors and the heroics of goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario prevented it from being a hammering.\n\nIt was the beginning of a painful journey to the end.\n\nWhen Frank was at Brentford, he had a reputation for clarity of thought, strategy and communication - a personality who could detect problems and solve them.\n\nThose qualities were lost as Spurs hit the buffers after winning his first two Premier League games in charge.\n\nEither Frank was not clear enough or the Spurs players did not buy into his approach.\n\nIf regular observers were asked to identify any obvious style or strategy, they would struggle to answer. This was a mishmash of ideas with no clear identification marks.\n\nFrank started with two wins: at home against Burnley, then at Manchester City. But, as with Postecoglou, a bright start soon subsided.\n\nAt Brentford, Frank's plan was to play long, play quick, and pressurise opponents in open play and set-pieces. There was quality too, with forwards such as Ivan Toney, Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa.\n\nFrank never established any obvious identity at Spurs, with fans quickly turning against what they saw as at best a pragmatic approach, and at worst a negative one.\n\nFans, and on many occasions players, either failed to understand Frank's strategy or believe in it, with the head coach himself sometimes looking shocked at the manner of Spurs' unravelling.\n\nOne of Frank's first acts was to name Cristian Romero as captain in succession to Son Heung-Min. It was an ill-judged decision to hand the armband to the Argentine World Cup winner. Too often he has been a liability on the field - at times a red card waiting to happen - and off the pitch with loose-lipped statements.\n\nThe former was proven in red cards against Liverpool and at Manchester United, the latter in two outbursts against the club's hierarchy - the first effectively accusing them of lying in a later edited Instagram post then, saying the lack of available players was \"disgraceful\".\n\nIt did Frank more harm than good.\n\nFor all the failings on the pitch, Frank did not enjoy the best of fortunes when it came to players available to him.\n\nInjuries denied him the chance to use some of his most influential performers. And there also was the departure of the iconic Son.\n\nAnother major blow came when the club let the potential signing of Eze drag on so long that Arsenal seized the opportunity to hijack his move from Crystal Palace.\n\nSpurs also thought they had a £60m deal to sign Nottingham Forest's gifted midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White, with a medical tentatively pencilled in. But Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis begged to differ, and the saga ended with the player signing a new deal.\n\nIn Eze and Gibbs-White, Spurs could have acquired match-winners who might have proved priceless to Frank.\n\nDejan Kulusevski - one of Spurs' most dangerous game-changers - never played a minute under Frank because of surgery on a patella injury sustained last season.\n\nEngland midfielder James Maddison had been in and out under Postecoglou, but his hopes of making an impact under Frank disappeared when he tore his anterior cruciate ligament in a pre-season friendly against Newcastle in June.\n\nDominic Solanke - the side's £60m spearhead - was also missing for months after an operation on an ankle injury, while Mohammed Kudus - a £55m signing from West Ham - and Richarlison also suffered long-term injuries.\n\nWhile Frank was unable to find solutions, there is no question those absences were damaging.\n\nFormer chairman Daniel Levy was a permanent lightning rod for the anger of Spurs fans. When he departed in September, it was welcomed by the majority but left Frank \n\nFrank was - justifiably - a hugely popular figure at Brentford, not just for his success on the field but the close connection he forged with supporters.\n\nThe sight of him leading his players on a post-game lap of honour became familiar - and he would acknowledge faces he recognised in the crowd.\n\nIt was ironic, then, that one of the most toxic moments of Frank's brief reign came at the Gtech on New Year's Day, when he was greeted with loud jeers from the visiting Spurs fans at the end of a mind-numbing goalless draw.\n\nIt was not so easy to forge close bonds in a vast, state-of-the-art arena housing more than 61,000 supporters. They have to be forged by results - results which did not come, winning just two of 13 home league games.\n\nFrank's post-match lap of honour became a point of contention and controversy when defenders Djed Spence and Micky van de Ven brushed past him and refused to take part after the defeat at home by Chelsea, though they later apologised.\n\nEven if they were angry with fans, the manner in which they brusquely dismissed Frank's wishes sent out poor signals, raising doubts about his level of control.\n\nFor all Spence's contrition, the manager again faced awkward questions about his defender's reaction to being substituted during the dismal 3-0 loss at Nottingham Forest.\n\nIt has been a miserable, joyless reign. Too often games ended in discontent - a disconnect noted by the club.\n\nFrank certainly never felt the need to publicly criticise his own supporters at Brentford - a move that rarely ends well - but after a defeat by Fulham he declared the booing of goalkeeper Vicario \"unacceptable\" and not the actions of \"true Spurs supporters\".\n\nTo do so - even to only a section of the crowd - was a high-risk strategy. He never got the wins to heal that fracture.\n\nFrank's reign also proved to be unwittingly accident prone, as when he was caught on camera unwittingly drinking out of an Arsenal cup before the defeat at Bournemouth in January.\n\nA small matter not of Frank's doing, but led to him being lampooned by Gunners' fans, with memes depicting the Spurs boss relaxing in Arsenal pyjamas while sitting on a red-and-white club duvet.\n\nFrank's honesty, upbeat demeanour and results meant he was idolised at Brentford. It was the polar opposite at Spurs.\n\nTime and patience - precious commodities at Brentford - were in short supply. Not just from the post-Levy powerbrokers, but from fans who simply never warmed to Frank, and who were unconvinced by his pedigree and methods.\n\nThere was no doubt many Spurs supporters felt Frank was not up to the job from the start - his solid grounding at a smaller club in Brentford not, in their eyes, the background required to wrestle with the unwieldy beast in north London.\n\nFrank needed to make an instant impact to dispel the doubts. He was unable to do so.\n\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Tottenham - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Ahead of facing Liverpool, we spoke to fan writer Ben Pescod to find out what’s going wrong for Arne Slot currently.",
    "fullText": "It seems crazy to suggest after winning the title last season, but with one win in eight, is pressure really starting to mount on Arne Slot again?\n\nIt’s a bit of an uncomfortable conversation. Slot done a brilliant job to win the league last season, especially taking over from Jurgen Klopp. He’s also had to deal with devastating circumstances that you just can never prepare for and he navigated that extremely well. However, strictly talking football, it’s nowhere near good enough. 24 points from the last 20 league games is a dreadful return. His saving grace has been the form in Europe, but one league win in 2026 is impossible to defend. Xabi Alonso’s departure from Real Madrid hasn’t helped the situation and now with Man United and Chelsea finding form, hopes of Champions League football are fading.\n\nAfter being so dominant last season, what would you say are the key factors behind Liverpool’s drop in form?\n\nLast season we were truly brilliant and were comfortably the best team in the league. This year, it feels like the entire league has leaned towards a more direct and physical style of play and we have gone the complete other direction. We’re soft and weak as a squad and one of the easiest teams to play through in the entire league. Age has finally caught up with Mo Salah, which is sad to see but was bound to happen eventually. Perhaps our struggles has really reinforced just how brilliant he was last season.\n\nOne of Liverpool’s key troubles is on the road, with just two away wins since mid-September – what issues are you facing away from Anfield?\n\nWe can’t deal with the pace and physicality of a lot of teams. Set pieces have been a massive issue with our set-piece coach recently being sacked. Should teams allow us the ball, we’re relying on a moment of magic from Wirtz or Ekitike. If they’re susceptible on the break, we don’t have the pace or directness to punish sides.\n\nWith Dominik Szoboszlai suspended and Liverpool failing to sign Lutsharel Geertruida, who do you expect to deputise at right-back?\n\nBelieve it or not we do have a natural right-back still available in Calvin Ramsay, but Slot has been quite blunt in his dismissal of him. A return for Joe Gomez would be timely, but he was absent from the squad on Sunday so remains a doubt.\n\nCurtis Jones is the likeliest option to fill in and has had a few good games at right-back in the past. However, he seems to suit that role in games that we control and I can’t imagine that being the case on Wednesday. He’s a really talented footballer, perhaps our most underrated player, but hasn’t been trusted enough this season. Wataru Endo is another option, but I struggle to see Slot opting for that.\n\nLiverpool spent over £400m on Jeremie Frimpong, Florian Wirtz, Milos Kerkez, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak. Who has impressed you most and who has been underwhelming?\n\nIn terms of the new signings, I’m still positive on all of them. Milos Kerkez had a tough start but has really improved in the past month or so.\n\nEkitike and Wirtz are two very special players. Ekitike hit the ground running and is such a fun player to watch. 15 goals and 4 assists already is an incredible return.\n\nThe performances have always been there with Wirtz, but the goal involvements are now starting to really click. With a £116m price tag, it’s almost impossible to forget that, but he’s immensely talented and works harder than you’d perhaps expect.\n\nFrimpong has had injury struggles but has looked good in most of his games, whilst Mamardashvili won’t really be properly judged until he takes over for Alisson Becker.\n\nIn terms of being underwhelmed, you would have to say Alexander Isak. Context of course matters and it took him a while to get anywhere near being fully fit. However, £125m is a massive amount of money and it remains to be seen how he will recover from this serious injury. I’d say he has enough credit in the bank to not be too worried over how good he will become for Liverpool.\n\nIf you were Regis Le Bris, how would you expose Liverpool’s weaknesses?\n\nIf I were Le Bris, the right-back situation is a glaring weakness. I’ve been hugely impressed with the likes of Chemsdine Talbi and I’ve heard great things about Nilson Angulo. Get one of those at the right-back.\n\nBrian Brobbey against Virgil van Dijk and Ibou Konate will be some battle and perhaps the difference maker could be getting someone like Enzo Le Fee right up there with him. Liverpool struggle with second balls and he has the talent to punish that.\n\nAre any players missing, and who do you think will start?\n\nSlot doesn’t have a tone of options to change really. Alisson will stay in goal and VVD and Konate are our only centre/back options at the moment. Kerkez will go again at left-back and then he has a big decision to make at right-back, which I think it’ll be Curtis Jones.\n\nGravenberch and Mac Allister will form the double pivot and try an provide a foundation for Wirtz. If Xhaka is still sidelined, I think Liverpool’s biggest chance of getting a result is exposing that space and getting Wirtz and Ekitike linking up.\n\nSalah and Gakpo are the only real options on both wings, frustratingly.\n\nSunderland are currently unbeaten at the Stadium of Light – what is your prediction for the final score?\n\nMy prediction is Sunderland 1-1 Liverpool. I rate this Sunderland side so highly and I think they’re everything that Arne Slot hates at the moment. Immense physicality, a really strong defence and big quality.\n\nA defeat would be a massive blow and could see us fall seven points behind Chelsea in fifth.\n\nA night match at the Stadium of Light, this will be one of the toughest games of the season.",

    "description": "There are several gold medal opportunities for the United States today in Italy.",
    "fullText": "The Winter Games have begun in Italy. From the rink to the slopes, a new generation of stars has emerged to chase gold. We’ll keep you connected to all of the thrilling moments and top stories as we track the medal race each day of the Games.\n\nThe United States is up to seven total medals so far in Italy, and will have several opportunities to add to that count in Day 5 of the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nJordan Stoltz will attempt to continue his dominant run throughout speed skating in the 1,000 meters, and the women's double luge will have its first ever gold medal awarded at the Olympics later Wednesday. Madison Chock and Evan Bates are back in action with their final ice dancing event. Oh, and Chloe Kim will hit the halfpipe for the first time, too.\n\nHere are the top five things to watch on Wednesday at the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics:\n\nIt’s time for Jordan Stoltz to take the ice in Italy. The Team USA speed skating star will open with the 1,000 meters on Wednesday, the event in which he already holds the world record. He made his Olympics debut in Beijing four years ago and finished only 14th in the 1,000 meters, though he’s widely considered a medal favorite every time he takes the ice in these games.\n\nBut the 1,000 meter is his best event. Stoltz has five wins at that distance already this season, and has won 14 races in a row in that distance on the World Cup level. Stoltz will also compete in the 500 meters, 1,500 meters and mass start.\n\nChloe Kim is ready for her first event in Italy. The top name in the sport will open her quest to become the first person to win three straight gold medals in the halfpipe, starting with qualifying Wednesday. Kim was 17 when she won gold in South Korea in 2018, and she backed it up in Beijing four years ago, too. But Kim is now dealing with a torn labrum, which she suffered during training in Switzerland.\n\nIf she can get through qualifying, the final of the women’s halfpipe is set for Thursday.\n\nThe women’s doubles luge was added to the Olympics for the first time this year after more than six decades on the men’s side. It’ll be up to Chevonne Forgan and Sophia Kirkby to lead the way for the United States.\n\nThe duo, who are the only American women’s pairing, won bronze at the first ever world championship back in 2022. They’ve looked good so far, too, with a top five time in five of their six training runs. But it’s Austria’s Selina Egle and Lara Kipp who are the favorites, as they both lead the World Cup standings and have won three training runs so far.\n\nMadison Chock and Evan Bates will enter Wednesday’s ice dance free skate in second place, so they’ll have to rally a bit in order to pull off the gold medal. They trailed France’s Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron by less than half a point after the rhythm dance portion of the competition on Monday.\n\nMadison Chock and Evan Bates with a STELLAR first-place ice dance performance to start off strong for Team USA! 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/kk0O802JTr\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 6, 2026\n\nThe married couple are the reigning world champions in the event, and are just days removed from helping the U.S. win a second straight team gold medal. But the individual medal is the last piece they’ve been chasing after a fourth-place finish in Beijing.\n\nAll eyes will be on Ryan Cochran-Siegle when he hits the Super-G on Wednesday. He was the only American Alpine skier to win a medal at the Beijing Olympics when he won silver in the event four years ago.\n\nBut competition is stiff for Cochran-Siegle to improve on that finish this time around. Switzerland’s Marco Odermatt is the favorite in the event, with already two wins to his name this season. A trio of Austrians have dominated the World Cup season race, too, and Italy’s Giovanni Franzoni is a big name to watch.\n\nHe has his work cut out for him, but he is the only returning medalist from Beijing.

    "fullText": "Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior has confirmed that key player Marc Cucurella is set for a scan after coming off injured last night.\n\nThe Blues threw away a comfortable 2-0 lead against Leeds United in their latest Premier League match last night, to end up drawing the game 2-2 and also throwing away two vital points in the race for Champions League qualification.\n\nAfter Joao Pedro opened the scoring, which was soon added to by a Cole Palmer penalty, Rosenior and Chelsea were in dreamland cruising the game. They played some superb football in that first half.\n\nPedro was fantastic leading the line again, and he earned some rightful praise from his manager after the game in his post-match interview.\n\nAway from the analysis, Cucurella came off at half time and was replaced with Jorrel Hato.\n\nMarc Cucurella battles for possession against Wolves. (Photo by Dan Istitene/Getty Images)\n\nIn words cited on X after the game, The Blues boss said Cucurella “felt his hamstring” and had to come off at half-time!\n\nRosenior says the Spanish full back will have a scan to see if he’s available for the next game.\n\nObviously we will now be eagerly awaiting the results of this scan because Cucurella is a big player for this team and one of the more experienced players we have, so he has become a vital cog in the Chelsea machine.\n\nThe positive thing here is that Cucurella didn’t go down, or look in any pain, and he walked off normally at half time. So this should hopefully suggest that the injury was not anything too bad or will be too serious.",

    "fullText": "Skyridge continued its Region 3 revenge tour on Tuesday night with another impressive victory.\n\nThe Falcons raced to a 21-point halftime lead at Corner Canyon and then held off a furious second-half push from the home team as they secured the 69-60 victory.\n\nAfter going 0-4 through the first half of region play, Skyridge has suddenly won three straight region games, avenging previous losses to Lehi, Lone Peak and now Corner Canyon.\n\nSkyridge coach Jeff Gardner said there’s been no major changes in recent weeks to flip those losses to wins, but rather the team just kept learning and staying patient.\n\n“You know, I think staying the course more than anything. We knew that we had lost to good teams and we were very competitive in most of those situations, and so it was no panic, stick the course and that was really our mentality,” said Gardner. “We just kept trying to do what we do well better, and just keep our head down and work.”\n\nCombined with a couple of nonregion wins during this recent stretch, Skyridge has won straight and now sits a 14-7 on the season.\n\nRyder Gentry led the way with 21 points, with Carson Mosteller making half of his team’s 10 3-pointers in finishing with 18 points.\n\nSkyridge will try and complete its Region 3 revenge tour this Friday when it hosts American Fork, a team it fell behind by double digits in last month’s meeting and never recovered.\n\nThe opposite game flow unfolded on Tuesday as Skyridge shot 68% in the first half and made eight 3-pointers in rolling to the 43-22 halftime lead over the Chargers.\n\nIt was as good a half of basketball as a team can expect to play in February.\n\n“You know, the first half was one of those where we just played really well, we got baskets in transition and in our half court stuff we just did a good job of cutting hard, moving hard, making good passes and executing what we wanted to execute,” said Gardner.\n\nSkyridge made 8-of-14 3-pointers in that opening half, and nearly half of them were wide-open looks created in the flow of the offense.\n\n“Corner Canyon is such a good defensive team, to do it against them is even more special because you know Coach (Dan) Lunt does just a incredible job with his team on both ends of the floor and so it was awesome,” said Gardner.\n\nAt the half, Gardner stressed to his team that a 21-point lead against a quality team like Corner Canyon was not insurmountable. Sure enough, the cushion started to evaporate pretty quickly in the third.\n\nSkyridge only turned the ball over four times in the first half, but in less than five minutes of the third quarter Corner Canyon’s increased defensive pressure led to four turnovers and quick transition buckets as the lead shrunk to 48-39 with 3:32 left in the quarter.\n\n“They definitely put a little more pressure on us and their length caused some issues getting in some passing lanes,” said Gardner.\n\nHe knew his team needed a push back before the lead complete vanished, and that’s what his experienced squad did. Skyridge outscored Corner Canyon 7-2 to close the quarter to stretch the lead to 55-41.\n\n“I was super proud that we were able to kind of stop the bleeding and keep it there, because if that thing gets back to four going into the fourth quarter, now it’s all bets are off,” said Gardner.\n\nRyder Gentry’s four-point play highlighted the spurt with 48 seconds left in the quarter.\n\nEven though Gardner said a 14-point lead was far from comfortable, it gave his team the extra breathing room it needed in the fourth.\n\nCorner Canyon scored on its first five possessions of the fourth to trim the lead to 60-53 with five minutes remaining.\n\nThe Chargers cut the lead to six points on two different occasions, and even had a good look at a 3-pointer with under 90 seconds remaining to potentially make it a one-score game.\n\nAfter that miss, however, Skyridge took care of the ball and was able seal the win from the free throw line.\n\nThe Falcons did not turn the ball over once in the fourth quarter despite Corner Canyon’s frenetic pace defensively, which allowed them to work some shot clock and get quality shots in the fourth.\n\n“We’ve got a lot of seniors that play that have a lot of experience, a lot of them played last year and that helps, they’ve been there, they didn’t panic,” said Gardner.",

    "fullText": "Devin Booker is still unsure of playing in back-to-back games for the Phoenix Suns originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nDevin Booker and the Phoenix Suns have had an impressive 2025-26 season, as they have a 32-22 record. This is much better compared to their struggles over the past few seasons.\n\nUnfortunately for the Suns, they have dealt with injury issues throughout the season. Jalen Green has been struggling with constant hamstring injuries, and Booker has also been dealing with ankle issues recently.\n\nHead coach Jordan Ott wants to be careful with both Green and Booker after recovering from their injuries. The situation with Green is particularly troubling because they are worried that he could re-aggravate the hamstring again.\n\nBooker returned a bit earlier than expected from his ankle injury, so the Suns want to be careful with his return as well. Since Tuesday's game against the Dallas Mavericks was the first leg of a back-to-back, Booker's presence in the second leg is questionable.\n\nMORE:Devin Booker's ankle injury could be a nightmare for the Phoenix Suns' promising season\n\nOn Wednesday, the Suns will be playing against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Considering it is an important game that will see them go against the defending champions, the Suns would love to have Booker and Green.\n\nHowever, the Suns will only make that choice when the day rolls around. After the Mavericks game, the Suns will give the players some time to recover and find out if they can play.\n\n\"Seeing how it feels, usually the next day is the tough day. For now, just making sure the swelling is a bit down and manageable,\" Booker said after the Suns' win against the Mavericks.\n\nThe Suns are taking the right approach, especially with what happened to Green earlier this season. He was ready to go in November, but after injuring his hamstring again, the Suns have become more careful.\n\nIt will be tough against the Thunder, but they will be ready to compete. With Dillon Brooks playing high-level basketball this season, the Suns will always be a threat.\n\nSuns trade for Cole Anthony, duck under luxury tax\n\nDillon Brooks calls out Joel Embiid's 'flopping' after Suns' loss to the 76ers\n\nDillon Brooks credits his Phoenix Suns teammates for helping him win Player of the Week\n\nCollin Gillespie joins Suns' all-time greats with monster game vs. Trail Blazers\n\nDraymond Green takes another swipe at Dillon Brooks",

    "fullText": "After making a strong start to the 25/26 season, Phil Foden hit the proverbial wall late in December and throughout January. A heavy workload caused Foden to become fatigued, and subsequently his performances weren’t at the high standards that they were at the beginning of this season. Tonight, Manchester City take on Fulham in an important Premier League fixture. The scene at the Etihad could be set for Foden to return to form against an opponent that he played well against in City’s 5-4 win at Craven Cottage at the beginning of December.\n\nPhil Foden hasn’t started any of Manchester City’s past three Premier League matches. Foden’s last start came in Manchester City’s 2-0 defeat to Manchester United. He only played the first half of that match. Since then, Foden has played 29 minutes against Wolves, 2 minutes against Tottenham, and he was an unused substitute against Liverpool (statistics sourced from transfermarkt.com). Foden has had a sustained period of rest that he desperately needed. The hope is that it helps him feel refreshed and can help him get back to the form that he showed earlier this season.\n\nManchester City will be hoping that by giving Phil Foden the rest he needs, he can get back to his best form. Foden at his best remains one of the best players in the Premier League. With City still challenging for honors on four fronts, they need every player to contribute to the cause. Given Foden’s importance to Pep Guardiola’s side, they especially need him back in form for what lies ahead.\n\nWhen Manchester City last played Fulham, City won a pulsating match 5-4 at Craven Cottage. The match didn’t make a whole lot of sense, but Pep Guardiola’s side hung on to claim a valuable three points. On that night in London, Foden bagged a brace. His overall performance was also superb, as he was poised in possession and did everything his team needed to help them win a thriller. Foden has runs on the board against tonight’s opponent, so perhaps tonight’s match at the Etihad is the ideal setting for Foden to bounce back into form.\n\nPhil Foden has now had a sustained period of rest that he so desperately needed. After having the opportunity to rest, it is hoped that we see Foden back to his dazzling best. Tonight’s match could be the ideal setting for Foden to make a big impact for Manchester City. Foden was superb against Fulham in December, and if he starts tonight’s match and can make an impact, it could be a big moment for what lies ahead this season.",

    "fullText": "We cannot fully know the answer. But there is an alternative scenario where Liverpool are merely publicly backing him but behind the scenes perhaps something else is going on.\n\nThe club may already be preparing for his successor.\n\nBut what if that successor is not available right now? What if that successor is only available in the summer so Liverpool have to wait?\n\nThis could be entirely possible. The most perfect candidate to replace Slot might be Julian Nagelsmann, who won't be leaving his role as manager of Germany until the World Cup concludes in North America.\n\nNagelsmann is the ideal fit because he has very similar principles to Jurgen Klopp, just with a more modern hint.\n\nHe is also a young and developing manager with world-class potential. In fact, given his achievements in the game at Bayern Munich, RB Leipzig, FC Hoffenheim and now the German national team, you'd probably already call him world-class.\n\nNagelsmann is only 38-years-old but he already has so much experience for someone of his age. His methods are extremely effective and despite Germany not having a great squad, they will be one of the favourites because of Nagelsmann at the World Cup.\n\nWhat makes the German such an ideal fit is that he comes from the pressing mindset. He was someone who admired Jurgen Klopp's style of play and who always implemented successful gegenpressing systems.\n\nRight now, Liverpool's lack of pressing is a massive issue. Slot just doesn't seem to be able to introduce a press that works effectively. It's all over the place.\n\nNagelsmann has a track-record of doing this at international and club level. He has worked at more teams than Slot and more importantly he has worked with several of the club's current stars, including Dominik Szoboszlai, Ibrahima Konate and Florian Wirtz.\n\nHe's the perfect candidate, and waiting for him might make sense.",

    "fullText": "The Detroit Red Wings are fortunate to boast two of the most highly regarded goaltending prospects in the National Hockey League, and fans hope both will eventually help backstop the franchise to Stanley Cup glory.\n\nSebastian Cossa (15th overall, 2021) and Trey Augustine (41st overall, 2023) each possess sky-high potential and have delivered for their respective teams this season.\n\nWhile Augustine recently tied former Red Wing Bob Essensa for eighth all-time in victories by a Michigan State Spartans goaltender, Cossa has led the way in the crease during what has become a historic campaign for the AHL's Grand Rapids Griffins.\n\nThe Griffins (35-7-2-1) are the best team in the AHL, and the play of Cossa has been a major reason why. He's amassed a sparkling 20-4-2 record while posting a 1.99 goals-against average, a .928 save percentage, and four shutouts.\n\nFor the second consecutive season, he was named an AHL All-Star and took part in Tuesday evening's skills competition.\n\nSebastian Cossa wraps up his night stopping 3/5 in the Breakaway Relay!#AHLAllStar #GoGRG #LGRW pic.twitter.com/Za9DMfII5q\n\n— Hockeytown West Podcast (@HockeytownWpod) February 11, 2026\n\nSebastian Cossa stopped 2/3 in the Pass & Score contest going up against the trio of Laurent Dauphin, Zac Jones, & Patrick Brown!\n\nThis one seems so unfair to the goalies 😂 but Cossa did great!#AHLAllStar #GoGRG #LGRW pic.twitter.com/xgMmCuchsx\n\n— Hockeytown West Podcast (@HockeytownWpod) February 11, 2026\n\nBookmark The Hockey News Detroit Red Wings team site to stay connected to the latest news, game-day coverage, and player features.\n\nCossa, who is eligible to become a restricted free agent at the end of the season, spoke during Training Camp about the importance of performing at his best in a contract year.\n\n\"It’s a contract year for me, so a big year,\" Cossa said in September. \"I had a really good summer, put in a lot of work. I’m just trying to stay consistent throughout the year, get my shots when I can. Use the experience I’ve gained the past couple years to really push the pace and be the best version of myself.\"\n\nRe-signing Cossa should not pose a problem for Red Wings GM Steve Yzerman, and he is expected to compete for a full-time role as Detroit’s backup, or potentially even their starter, during training camp next season.\n\nNever miss a story by adding us to your Google News favorites!\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

    "description": "Cougars force 13 turnovers and use a smothering defense to take care of the Runnin’ Utes.",
    "fullText": "Three days after Utah faced Kansas on the road at historic Allen Fieldhouse, the Runnin’ Utes were hosting No. 3 Houston at the Huntsman Center on Tuesday night.\n\nTalk about a challenging back-to-back.\n\nUtah had a couple nice little stretches, but ultimately, the Cougars showed exactly why they’re a top-five team.\n\nHouston just doesn’t make too many mistakes, and they force their opponents into a lot, thanks to the tenacious defense the Cougars are known for.\n\n“They do what they do, and they really expose your weakness as a team,” Utah coach Alex Jensen said. “But great crowd tonight, I thought. The student section, they stayed till the end, and I was happy with our guys at the end that kept playing.”\n\nAfter Houston built a 15-point first-half lead, the Utes’ most impressive stretch of the night made it competitive going into the break.\n\nUtah finished the first half on a 7-1 run to end the first half and was down 34-25 at the break.\n\nHouston, though, put the defensive squeeze on to start the second half, and that carried them to the victory.\n\nThe Cougars forced turnovers on Utah’s first three possessions of the second half, and turned each of those takeaways into points.\n\nThat 6-0 spurt over the half’s first two minutes reset the tone for Houston (22-2, 10-1 Big 12), and from there, the Cougars never let the Utes (9-15, 1-10 Big 12) challenge them again.\n\nIt was the sixth straight loss for Utah.\n\nHouston guard Emanuel Sharp had an outstanding night, from his defense to his 3-point shooting.\n\nSharp made 6 of 7 from long range over the game’s first 10 and a half minutes, and he hit two more 3-pointers back-to-back in the second half to push the Cougars’ lead to 48-39.\n\nSharp was the only sharpshooter from 3-point range in the game. Houston as a team was 9 of 26, including 1 of 13 outside of Sharp, while Utah went just 2 of 17.\n\n“A game like tonight, we really focused on rebounding, because that’s where I think they really bury you — they get the ball up, and then they crash two or three guys and just smother you on the boards,” Jensen said.\n\n“He had the six 3s (before halftime), that was the difference in the first half. There were two of them we showed at halftime that were mental errors on our part, not because it was him shooting it, but just we missed an assignment, or we rotated when we didn’t.”\n\nSharp ended up with 27 points and was the only Houston player to finish with double-digit scoring.\n\nHouston coach Kelvin Sampson praised the senior for his toughness, his defensive work and “his heart and attitude” Tuesday night, which included helping shut down Utah’s leading scorer, Terrence Brown.\n\n“His teams win 30 games every year (at Houston),” Sampson said of Sharp. “It’s not because of his 3s. It’s because of his toughness and his defense and the fact that he can not shoot (and be a contributor) is why we recruited him. His heart and his attitude, it brings that out,” Sampson said.\n\nBrown ended up with 12 points, on 3 of 8 shooting, while also hitting 6 of 8 from the free-throw line.\n\nBrown, who is averaging over 21 points per game, didn’t score his first field goal until two minutes remained in the second half, and seven of his points came in the final seven minutes after Utah had fallen behind by as many as 22 points.\n\n“Terrence came up to me in the handshake line, and I tapped him on his chest. I told him to keep fighting, and that’s important for those kids to keep fighting,” Sampon said. “He said, ‘Man, y’all can guard.’ I said, ‘Y’all can, but the guy who guarded you really can.’”\n\nHouston’s suffocating defense was a deterrent for fellow guard Don McHenry, who had just five points.\n\nThe Cougars forced Utah into 13 turnovers and converted those takeaways into 20 points.\n\n“They had a great defensive team, you want to take care of the ball as much as possible. You want to limit your turnovers,” said Utah’s Seydou Traore, who had one of Utah’s best individual stat lines of the night with 12 points, four assists, two rebounds and a steal.\n\n“Thirteen is kind of a lot playing a top 10 team like this, because they can execute off it every time. Gotta take care of the ball.”\n\nThe Cougars’ never-ending effort also led to a 12-5 edge in offensive rebounds, which turned into a 12-4 advantage in second-chance points.\n\n“Our margin for error as a team is small, but especially against Houston offensively, it’s going to be that much smaller,” Jensen said, after his team didn’t surpass 10 points in the second half until a Traore 3-pointer with 7:54 to play.\n\nKeanu Dawes had another solid night for the Utes in the loss, finishing with 15 points and eight rebounds. That included 9 early points to help keep Utah in the game through the first 10 minutes.\n\nAfter facing a pair of back-to-back top 10 programs, the Utes will have a few days’ rest, with their next game coming Sunday at Cincinnati.\n\nThere are some things Utah can take away from these games against juggernauts Kansas and Houston, who along with Arizona, sit atop the Big 12 standings.\n\n“That’s my message to the guys, not beating ourselves,” Jensen said. “… I keep saying it, our margin for error is small, but those little things that matter, and we’re getting better at it, but (focus) on the those little things that you can control. You can do it every possession — you might not make shots, but you can talk, which we’re getting better at.\n\n“And we had a couple good defensive possessions, then one guy didn’t block out tonight, but something you can control and do every time. So I think we’re learning that.”\n\nDawes can see the positives in these matchups as well, as he experiences his second year of Big 12 play.\n\n“This game probably got away from us faster than Kansas. I think it was about like the last eight minutes in Kansas,” Dawes said. “Things got away from us, but for the most part, we can really compete with any team. We just have to put it together for 40 minutes.”\n\nThat’s the objective Utah is chasing still, with seven games remaining in the regular season.",

Westchester then kicked it into gear, extending their lead to as many as 11 points in the first half while holding the Valley to just 19 points in the second quarter.\n\nDespite the deficit and being held under 20 points in the second, the Suns kept it competitive, trailing 56-47 at halftime.\n\nSep 24, 2025; Phoenix, AZ, USA; Phoenix Suns and Valley Suns guard Damion Baugh (30) poses for a portrait during Media Day at PHX Arena.

It didn’t take long for the Knicks to get their pace back, regaining their footing and taking an 81-70 lead.\n\nThe Knicks opened up another double-digit lead, but were limited from beyond the arc.

    "fullText": "For roughly two hundred years, cricketers across the world have almost exclusively walked out to the crease and taken their guard with bats made of the finest English willow - but that is now set to change.\n\nThe Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) announced last week that the laws of the game would allow the use of laminated bats in open age recreational cricket from October.\n\nLamination is typically where the English willow face is backed by cheaper and lesser-performing willow, such as that from Kashmir.\n\nOne of the world's largest suppliers of English willow is based in Banbury, and its director Jonny Clarke welcomed the change, saying it could make the sport more affordable for amateurs.\n\n\"Nothing beats a beautiful English Willow cricket bat,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"But I think this change really could open the doors and give much more accessibility to keen young cricketers as a lower cost alternative.\"\n\nClarke's company, which is simply called English Willow, plants trees on under-used farmland across the country - which they then purchase back from landowners when the wood is ready to harvest.\n\n\"We're the only country in the world that grows it to the standard it is because we've got the climate and the soils,\" he explained.\n\n\"But [the sport] is exploding - there's more and more people in the world and there's millions of people every year wanting to play more and more cricket.\"\n\nAnnouncing the law change last week, MCC laws manager Fraser Stewart said it had been introduced to combat the rising price of bats, and would not be implemented for the top level of the game.\n\n\"We felt if anything can be done for the lower levels of the sport that will help make it more affordable without changing the dynamics of the game then it's a sensible move to make,\" Stewart told BBC Sport.\n\n\"There's not really enough willow to go round,\" he added.\n\nBat prices are thought to have trebled following increased demand from countries in South Asia, with some top-end models costing close to £1,000.\n\nClarke said his company was \"quite aligned\" with the MCC regarding the law change.\n\n\"We want to look at this industry and look at new ideas and how we can advance it and how we can open it up to other people who want to play,\" he said.\n\n\"Cricket is expensive, and this gives the chance for a cheaper option to come through on to the market,\" he added.\n\nYou can follow BBC Oxfordshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.\n\nMCC changes Laws of Cricket to permit previously 'illegal' bats",

    "fullText": "Victor Wembanyama and the San Antonio Spurs ran roughshod over the injury-depleted Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, the French superstar matching his NBA season high with 40 points in a 136-108 rout.\n\nWembanyama, whose California swing will include a second All-Star Game appearance on Sunday, added 12 rebounds, two steals and a blocked shot, connecting on 13 of 20 attempts from the field in his 26 minutes of work.\n\nThe Lakers were without a raft of starters, with LeBron James and Luka Doncic sidelined along with Austin Reaves and Marcus Smart.\n\nDoncic missed a third straight game with a hamstring strain. James sat out the second night of a back-to-back to manage foot arthritis.\n\nWembanyama took full advantage, setting the tone with 25 points in just eight minutes on the floor in the first quarter.\n\nHe had 37 by halftime -- the most by any player in a first half this season -- when the Spurs led 84-55.\n\nHe cooled off in the third quarter, but matched the 40 points he put up on opening night before sitting out the fourth period with the rest of the Spurs starters.\n\nThe only down note for the Spurs was an injury to 2025 Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle, who took a hard fall under the basket in the second quarter and exited with a pelvic contusion.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers, fueled by 30 points from Pascal Siakam, stunned the New York Knicks 137-134 in an overtime thriller at Madison Square Garden.\n\nEight Pacers players scored in double figures to bring home the win in a game that featured a season-high 39 lead changes.\n\nAndrew Nembhard added 24 points and 10 rebounds and Quenton Jackson scored 19, including two game-sealing free-throws with 3.9 seconds left in overtime.\n\nJalen Brunson scored 40 points with five rebounds and eight assists for the Knicks. Josh Hart chipped in a triple-double of 15 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists.\n\nMikal Bridges and Karl-Anthony Towns added 22 points apiece -- Towns drilling two free-throws to force overtime before fouling out in the extra session.\n\nThe Pacers scored the first nine points in overtime before the Knicks staged a furious rally, cutting the deficit to one on a three-pointer from Brunson before Jackson closed it out at the line.\n\nThe Pacers have been a shadow of the team that beat the Knicks in the Eastern Conference finals last season with Tyrese Haliburton sidelined by the ruptured Achilles tendon he suffered in their NBA Finals loss to Oklahoma City.\n\nBut they snapped a four-game skid with just their fourth road win of the season, this one against a Knicks team that came in tied for the second most home wins in the league with 21.\n\n\"This was a really important game for us,\" said Pacers coach Rick Carlisle. \"The season that we've had, this environment, the opponent -- our guys had a great collective spirit and collective will tonight.\"\n\nIn Houston, Kevin Durant scored 26 points to lead the Rockets to a 102-95 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nDown by one at halftime, the Rockets took control in the third quarter. They led by six going into the fourth and quickly pushed the lead to 15 to cruise home.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nPuka Nacua and entrepreneur Shay Mitchell got it done at San Francisco’s Ghirardelli Square, hosting the “Béis Bowl Weekend” pop-up event at the San Francisco Brewing Co. With the activation, the brand capitalized on the festivities surrounding Super Bowl LX. The event at 3150 Polk Street drew hundreds of fans to “The City by the Bay” ahead of the big game.\n\nNacua had a dominant 2025 campaign for the Rams. The former BYU wide receiver, coming off a First-team All-Pro selection, led the NFL with 129 receptions and 1,715 receiving yards during the regular season. The performance made him the face of the brand’s first major sports-lifestyle crossover.\n\nWhile Bad Bunny headlined the halftime show during the Super Bowl, Béis founder Shay Mitchell had some headlines of her own to make. She called it the Béis Bowl.\n\nMitchell, who hosted the event on Feb. 7, selected Nacua as her official co-host.\n\n“Bad Bunny did the halftime. Béis did the weekend,” Mitchell captioned a post.\n\nThe snap showed a digital timer set to 00:00:00 and white traffic cones branded with the Béis logo. Mitchell was pictured on the left, wearing a brown leather jacket and plaid skirt, while Nacua stood to the right in a blazer and jeans.\n\n“Bad Bunny did the halftime. Béis did the weekend,” Shay Mitchell. @AsapPukapic.twitter.com/PbUX9rclyh\n\n— MOHAMMAD ASIF ANSARI (@WriterMohammad) February 11, 2026\n\nThe exclusive activation featured a “Gameplan” itinerary that included football-themed challenges where Nacua and Mitchell competed against guests. Nacua utilized the event to engage with the local community days after participating in the 2026 Pro Bowl Games at San Francisco’s Moscone Center.\n\n“I’m really happy for those guys; I think there were a lot of guys that were also recognized as alternates,” Rams head coach Sean McVay stated regarding the Pro Bowl honors.\n\nMORE: Puka Nacua faces backlash over comments about Sam Darnold after Seahawks' Super Bowl win\n\nDespite missing out on a Super Bowl appearance, Nacua continued his stellar play into the postseason. In the NFC Championship on Jan. 25, the Rams wideout recorded nine catches for 165 yards and a touchdown against the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nNacua wasn’t the only one making waves on social media. On Jan. 31, he initiated a viral exchange by quoting an interview featuring actress Sydney Sweeney, who noted she needed someone to “go skydiving with me.”\n\n“Love skydiving,” Nacua wrote. During the 2026 Super Bowl media week, he escalated the joke, claiming, “I have reservations for us on Wednesday, actually.”\n\nLove skydiving https://t.co/evgL5lqw7M\n\n— Puka Nacua (@AsapPuka) January 31, 2026\n\nHowever, the All-Pro pass catcher later admitted to Overtime that the claim was a “full send” joke, confessing he has an actual fear of heights. Speaking to NFL Network’s Colleen Wolfe ahead of the NFL Honors, he maintained the bit, promising to “get a video of it.” The “No Fear” mantra on his cleats was cited as motivation.\n\nWhile Nacua and the internet had their fun, Sweeney has been linked to music executive Scooter Braun throughout early 2026. On the other hand, Nacua was photographed dining with influencer Hannah Stocking at Matsuhisa in West Hollywood on Jan. 31.\n\nRams Super Bowl champion with 148 career starts announces retirement\n\nRams linked to trade for beloved Eagles backup QB as Matthew Stafford insurance\n\nRams should be 'sick' watching Seahawks win Super Bowl, claims analyst\n\nRams get exciting Kliff Kingsbury coaching news from ESPN report",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAlthough the Ohio State Buckeyes failed to repeat as national champions this past season, they are part of a select group of three consecutive Big Ten teams to win it all.\n\nWhether this year will continue the conference's trend, the Buckeyes are going to attempt to remain in that mix for a league and national title under coach Ryan Day.\n\nSome analysts, including CBS Sports' Cody Nagel, aren't fond of the Buckeyes' national title hopes entering this fall as he assessed 25 teams in a way-too-early Top 25 network.\n\nNagel ranked the Buckeyes at No. 1 despite him predicting that they will lose at least three games for the first time in 15 seasons.\n\n\"Ohio State has been a perennial national championship contender for most of the 21st century and expects to be in the title hunt again in 2026,\" Nagel wrote. \"But the Buckeyes face more hurdles than usual with one of the nation's toughest schedules, including five opponents from [Brandon] Marcello's way-too-early top 25. Ohio State hasn't lost more than two games since 2011. If there was ever a year for that streak to end, this is it.\"\n\nMORE: Kirk Herbstreit shares true feelings about Michigan's Bryce Underwood entering 2026 season\n\nFurther along in Nagel's preview, he notes that the Michigan Wolverines will regain momentum in \"The Game\" rivalry this November. Therefore, it would give the Wolverines their first head-to-head win against Ohio State since 2024. To make matters worse for the Buckeyes, their Nov. 7 opponent (Oregon Ducks) are a potential national title pick. Therefore, another loss there seems more likely than not.\n\nShould the Buckeyes miss the postseason, it would further validate the fact that the pressure Day faces from the Buckeyes' fanbase is real, raw and unapologetic.\n\nIf Nagel is proven correct, the next year in Columbus is going to be extremely interesting.\n\nMORE: Patriots coach Mike Vrabel shares harsh reality after losing Super Bowl 60 to Seahawks\n\nIllinois 2026 football schedule\n\nMichigan 2026 football schedule\n\nOhio State 2026 football schedule",

Francik worked around a leadoff walk, keeping Liberty off the board.\n\nIn the bottom of the inning, the Seminoles saw Gabby Mike in the circle. Early, Isa Torres had the defense scrambling on a soft hit single on the infield. Mike added Jaysoni Beachum on base by hit by pitch, however, the Liberty defense put up a 0 in the first inning.\n\nAfter a 3 up, 3 down inning from Francik, the Seminoles bats looked to push across their first run. A hard hit single from Marin Heller, walk to Beachum, and Shelby McKenzie single mishandled by the defense had ‘Noles at every bag.\n\nMike rolled a pair of ground balls, keeping the bases loaded, but putting two outs on the board. Now with Hayley Griggs at the plate, the freshman drew a walk to break the scoreless tie.\n\nAfter causing through the first three innings, Francik saw traffic in the 4th. A walk, followed by a single up the middle had Liberty threatening with no outs. A comebacker to the circle, followed by a ground ball to third, which turned into a double play by Beachum got FSU out of the inning unscathed.\n\nFIRE US UP DEFENSE🔥🔥🔥\n\nBack-to-back clutch plays to get us out of the inning‼️\n\n📺ACCNX#Team43 pic.twitter.com/ZfaXNotHDk\n\n— Florida State Softball 🥎 (@FSU_Softball) February 11, 2026\n\nMarlee Gaskell took over for Francik, looking to hold her teams 1-0 lead.

Liberty went to the bullpen, after Danley’s hit took Mike out of the circle. Out of the bullpen, it was Caitlyn Nesbitt to face the rest of the FSU lineup.\n\nFor her first batter, Nesbitt walked Anna Hinde with one out. A single into the outfield from Griggs scored one, and a single from Makenna Sturgis got another run in.

    "fullText": "Chelsea fans will soon start calling for returning loan player Mamadou Sarr to start games after the latest shambles at the back.\n\nThe Blues managed to throw away a 2-0 lead at home to relegation battlers Leeds United last night in a game they were completely cruising at the break and into the second half.\n\nAfter Joao Pedro opened the scoring, which was soon added to by a Cole Palmer penalty, Rosenior and Chelsea were in dreamland cruising the game. They played some superb football in that first half.\n\nPedro was fantastic leading the line again, and he earned some rightful praise from his manager after the game in his post-match interview.\n\nBut Leeds got back into the game and managed to get two goals themselves to end it with points shared, which was far from good enough for Chelsea.\n\nFirst they gave away a silly penalty after Moises Caicedo had a daft moment in our own box. Then not long after that, somehow between a bunch of them, mainly Josh Acheampong and Robert Sanchez, they failed to make a simple clearance and allowed Leeds to pounce in and score their second goal of the game.\n\nMamadou Sarr signs for Chelsea.\n\nI mean, he was bought back for a reason, right? And that wasn’t to sit on the bench. If he is as good as they say he is, then it might be time to start him soon, after an obvious settling back in period I would assume.\n\nChelsea need more confidence, dominance, and less panic in the heart of the defence, and hopefully he can provide just that.",

According to 'Bild', it is a muscular injury in the adductor area. He is expected to be sidelined for a few weeks again.\n\nSince joining the Swabians (19 months ago), this is already his seventh injury. Yet, the year had started promisingly for him. In the friendly match against Luzern, he scored and once again proved that he still has what it takes to play in the first team.\n\nSo far, he has only managed 156 minutes for the first team.

    "description": "The Los Angeles Angels won their arbitration hearing with Reid Detmers, locking him in at $2.625 million after a season that saw the former top pick find new success following a move to the bullpen.",
    "fullText": "ANAHEIM -- The Los Angeles Angels have won their arbitration hearing regarding Reid Detmers, as reported by Mark Feinsand of MLB.com. Detmers will be paid $2.625 million by the Angels rather than the $2.925 million figure that Detmers and his camp submitted.\n\nReid Detmers has lost his arbitration hearing against the Angels, per source. Detmers will earn $2.625 million in 2026; he had filed at $2.925 million.\n\n— Mark Feinsand (@Feinsand) February 11, 2026\n\nDetmers, who is coming off a solid season in which he posted a 3.96 ERA across 63.2 innings, saw his role change for the first time in his major league career, making the transition from a starter to a reliever.\n\nDetmers was effective as a reliever, striking out 30% of the batters he faced this past season. This comes as Detmers is coming off his best year since 2022, when he was still seen as a promising starter and the next reliable pitcher to come out of the Angels organization in a long time.\n\nDetmers, who was originally drafted with the 10th overall pick in the 2020 MLB Draft, was expected to provide the Angels with a frontline starter during a period when the organization lacked rotation depth. 2022 was the year in which he posted a 3.77 ERA across 25 starts and 129 innings.\n\nThis is also the same year in which Detmers recorded his no-hitter against the Tampa Bay Rays in May, the 12th no-hitter in franchise history, and the first complete game of his career.\n\nSafe to say, the Angels likely thought they were getting their next really good starter since the Jered Weaver era. Still, even after a promising year, struggles began to pile up, as Detmers was never able to find that same level of success until he eventually made the transition from being a starter to a reliever.\n\nEven with the newfound success, the Angels are expected to use Detmers as a reliever once again this upcoming season, though he currently projects as the No. 3 starter in the Angels' rotation behind Yusei Kikuchi and José Soriano.\n\nLikely, the Angels will be relying on a few reclamation projects to work in their favor, as they also brought in Grayson Rodriguez, a former top prospect, and Alek Manoah, a former All-Star in 2022, to help fill out the rotation.\n\nNevertheless, Detmers was the only player to have an arbitration hearing this past offseason. His loss is just the second out of nine cases announced so far.",

He described how important it was to \"raise his hand\" and accept help—from his family, his faith, and above all, from professional support.\n\nIn the meantime, according to his own statement, the Barcelona professional now feels \"completely different.\" His goal in the cup against Albacete was also a powerful emotional sign for him: a moment that showed he is on his way back.\n\nAt the same time, Araújo used his story to send a clear message: \"We are human beings, not just footballers. It's not just about money or fame.\"\n\nAraújo emphasized that working with experts has given him the necessary tools to cope with pressure and, ultimately, to be able to play football happily again.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "A few weeks ago, I was staring at a system prompt that was 127,000 tokens long. One hundred and twenty-seven thousand tokens - just the system prompt. Most of it was, you guessed it, tool schemas: JSON definitions for every possible thing the agent could do, most of which it would never touch in any given run.\n\nMy solution? I propose AgentScript: a code-first execution language where the LLM can only interact with the outside world by writing programs. No tool schemas, no function calling, no MCP, no multi-modal response gymnastics. The model writes code, a sandboxed runtime executes it, and the return value is the response. As simple as that.\n\nHere’s how tool calling works today: you define a bunch of tools as JSON schemas, stuff them into the system prompt, and hope the model picks the right one. Each tool needs a name, a description, parameter definitions, and examples. A single tool can easily consume hundreds of tokens. A production-grade system might have tens, sometimes hundrends, of tools.\n\nAnd the tools the model never uses still consume tokens - they’re sitting in the context window like furniture in a storage unit you’re paying rent on but never visiting (I would know something about that). As systems grow, you get this compounding problem: context inflation drives up latency and reduces alignment, both in turn drive up costs, and costs scale non-linearly because you’re paying for all those schema tokens on every single inference call.\n\nSince many agent tasks require iteration, filtering, branching, retries, and aggregation, when you encode these behaviors through repeated LLM calls or chained tool invocations, you’re effectively using natural language as a programming language. You’re asking the model to be both the thinker and the doer, when decades of CS have taught us that these should be separate concerns.\n\nIn the last few months, I’ve seen this become an exciting idea space: Program-of-thought prompting, code interpreter systems, Anthropic’s work on code execution with MCP - they all point to the same conclusion: models are better planners than executors, and deterministic computation belongs outside the model.\n\nAgentScript takes that insight to its logical conclusion.\n\nAgentScript enforces a code-only contract between a language model and its execution environment. In this world, the LLM is not an API client, not it is a conversational participant; it’s a program author that can only emit AgentScript code. So there is only one execution entry point, and all interaction with the world happens through code.\n\nThis collapses tool calling, function responses, and structured outputs into a single universal abstraction: program execution.\n\nThe execution model is deliberately boring:\n\nIntermediate data never enters the model’s context unless the program explicitly reads the persisted logs from the file system. This is my main insight: pull-based data access instead of push-based context stuffing.\n\nThe API surface can be intentionally tiny, for example:\n\nThe model already knows JavaScript. The API is small enough to learn once and never forget.\n\nAnd the safety model is simple: constraints are enforced by the runtime, not the model. The model can write whatever code it wants. The sandbox decides what actually executes, like only mounting the working directory, allowlisted commands, or network access.\n\nTo start with, a backwards-compatible model would be to force a tool call from LLM responses and only give it a single tool: execute_agentscript, and stop the loop based on the execution of the code.\n\nThere are also a few extensions I’m thinking about:\n\nWhen systems become too complex to reason about in prose, you re-found them on code. This has happened repeatedly in computing history, and it’s happening again now to agents.\n\nWritten on a flight from Amsterdam to New Delhi",

    "fullText": "I’m building a typesetting engine for a living (speedata Publisher). People keep asking me “why not just use Typst?” or “isn’t WeasyPrint good enough?” and I never had a good answer with real numbers. Just gut feeling. So I decided to actually measure it.\n\nI set up a simple benchmark, same document with all six tools. And what I learned was maybe not what I expected.\n\nThe task is simple: a mail merge. You have an XML file with name and address records, you fill in a letter template, and you get a PDF out. One page per letter, with a logo, sender info, recipient address, and some body text. Nothing special, really every tool should be able to do this.\n\nI tested with 1 record and with 500 records. All templates produce more or less the same visual output. Same A4 page, same Helvetica (or the similar TeX Gyre Heros clone), same logo, same layout with the sender on the right side and body text at 105mm width with hyphenation turned on.\n\nAll benchmarks ran with hyperfine on a macBook air M4 (16 GB). You can find the full setup on GitHub if you want to try it yourself.\n\nWith one page, sp and Typst are basically the same. Both under 110ms. Everything else is 3.5 to 5.6 times slower.\n\nOK so this is where it gets interesting. Typst does 500 pages in 157 milliseconds. That is not a typo. Once it is running, it spends about 0.3ms per page. sp, which was basically equal at one page, needs 4.4 seconds — 28 times slower.\n\nAt one page they are tied, at 500 pages it is not even close. Typst has maybe 60ms startup cost, and after that it just flies. The per-page cost of sp is roughly 28 times higher.\n\nAlso worth noting: WeasyPrint really does not scale well. It goes from “ok” at one page to “maybe go get a coffee” at 500. pdflatex on the other hand scales surprisingly well — the per-page cost is only about 0.8ms if you subtract the startup.\n\nSo if speed is all you care about, just use Typst, right?\n\nThis is where it gets more complicated. Open the PDFs next to each other and look at the body text:\n\nYou see the difference? The justified text looks different. Not because of different fonts — the decisions are different. Where to break the lines, where to hyphenate, how to distribute the whitespace.\n\npdflatex and sp use algorithms based on Knuth & Plass (the TeX line breaking algorithm). They look at the whole paragraph at once and find the best set of breakpoints for all lines together. The result is even word spacing, no rivers of white, and good hyphenation.\n\nTypst, WeasyPrint, and FOP seemingly use a much simpler algorithm. It looks like they go line by line from top to bottom and decide for each line separately. This is faster — and that is probably part of the reason why Typst scales so well. But you can see it. Some lines are too loose, some too tight. Hyphenation sometimes feels a bit random.\nEdit Typst’s author has clarified: “However, one thing we noticed is your assertion in the justification section that Typst is not using Knuth-Plass – we do, by default when justification is enabled. The only thing of the original paper we don’t implement are tightness classes to prevent a very tight line and a very wide line directly next to each other.”\n\nFor a simple letter, honestly both are fine. But try a narrow column with a technical text full of long words, and then you really see the difference. The Knuth-Plass output looks like a properly typeset book. The first-fit output looks like a web page that somebody printed.\n\nA benchmark cannot capture this.\n\nHere is what actually matters in production, and it has nothing to do with milliseconds: what happens when the content does not fit?\n\nThink of a product catalog. Each product gets one page: a data table at the top, product photos at the bottom. Simple enough. But then product number 47 has a table with 30 rows instead of 10. Now what?\n\nIn Typst, you can use measure() to get the height of the table and compare it with the available space. That is a reasonable approximation. But Typst cannot do a real trial layout across page breaks — it measures content in a single frame only.\n\nIn the speedata Publisher, you can do this:\n\nThis is real trial typesetting. It actually lays out the full content, with real page breaks, counts how many pages it needs, and then you decide: keep it, or throw it away and try with different settings. No other tool in this benchmark can do that.\n\nIs this slower than just going through the content without looking back? Of course. And maybe that is part of why sp is 28 times slower at 500 pages — it is built for careful layout, not for fast layout. But the alternative is that a human opens each PDF and manually checks if page 47 looks right. That is not a millisecond problem, that is a “you need to hire someone” problem.\n\nHere is an actual page from a spare parts catalog, built with the speedata Publisher. This is a very typical use case for a product catalog.\n\nLook at what is happening on this page. The data table grows from top to bottom — model by model, row by row. The product images at the bottom grow from bottom to top, in rows of up to four. The table and the images share the same page, and neither is allowed to overlap the other. The number of table rows varies per page, the number of product images varies per page, and the layout has to figure out on its own how to divide the available space.\n\nThis is not a fixed template. It is an adaptive layout. The engine places the table, measures how much room is left, and fills the remaining space with as many product images as will fit — bottom-aligned, in rows of four. If a page has fewer products, you get two images in the last row instead of four. If the table is longer, the images get pushed to the next page. All of this happens automatically, without a human touching any page.\n\nHow would you do this with the other tools?\n\nIn Typst, you could get close. You would measure() the table height, calculate the remaining space, and manually arrange images in a grid at the bottom. But you are doing layout math by hand, and if the table happens to break across pages, things get complicated fast. Typst has no built-in way to say “fill the rest of this page from the bottom up.”\n\nIn pdflatex or LuaLaTeX, you enter the world of TeX float placement — \\vfill, \\bottomrule, maybe a minipage at the bottom. For a single page with a known table height, you could hack something together. But for hundreds of pages where the table height varies? You would likely write a Lua callback in LuaLaTeX that inspects the page after layout and inserts the images. Possible, but painful.\n\nIn WeasyPrint, this is essentially not possible. CSS has no concept of “fill the remaining page from the bottom.” You would have to pre-calculate the table height outside of the rendering engine and generate custom CSS per page. At that point, you are not really using a layout engine anymore — you are the layout engine.\n\nIn Apache FOP, XSL-FO has some support for this kind of thing with region-after and fo:block-container, but in practice FOP’s implementation is limited. You might get a rough approximation, but the automatic “grow from bottom” behavior is not something FOP handles well.\n\nIn the speedata Publisher, this is roughly a dozen lines of layout XML. Place the table, ask how much space is left, arrange the images in the remaining area. It is exactly the kind of problem the tool was built for.\n\nThe real comparison is not “which tool is the fastest at a trivial task.” It is “which tool can even handle the task.”\n\nFor a mail merge, use Typst. Seriously. It is fast, the source files are nice to write, and the output looks good enough.\n\nBut once your layout needs go beyond “fill in a template, output PDF” — once you need the software to actually make decisions — things change. And that is where tools like sp become worth it, even if they need a few hundred milliseconds more per page.\n\nI went into this benchmark hoping that sp would be fastest at everything. It is not. Typst is 28 times faster at 500 pages, and I cannot really argue with that — they have done amazing engineering work.\n\nBut I also realized that the benchmark I set up — a simple mail merge — is exactly the kind of task where the strengths of sp do not show up at all. It is like you compare a sports car and a pickup truck on a flat highway. Sure, the sports car is faster. But that is not what you bought the truck for.\n\nThe right question is not “how many pages per second.” It is “how many pages until you need a human to check.” And that is much harder to measure.\n\nThe complete benchmark setup (all templates, scripts, and data) is on GitHub. Run ./benchmark.sh to reproduce on your own machine.",

    "fullText": "Hobby tunneling is tunnel construction as a pastime.[1][2] Usually, hobby tunnelers dig their tunnels by hand, using little equipment, and some can spend years or even decades to achieve any degree of completion.[2] In some cases tunnels have been dug secretly, and only discovered by chance.\n\nA tunnel is an underground passageway, dug through the surrounding soil or rock for the purpose of transport, passage or communication.[2] Tunnel construction is a sub-discipline of civil engineering[3] and usually the domain of engineers and construction companies. When civilians dig tunnels, it may be for criminal purposes (like smuggling or hiding illegal goods),[2] or gaining unauthorised access to an area.\n\nTunneling may be part of the building of underground dwellings. Subterranean construction may be done as an art form, as in the work of Ra Paulette.[4] Dutch graphic designer Leanne Wijnsma[1] digs short, shallow tunnels as an art form and for fun.[2] She had dug thirteen by 2015,[1] three at cultural festivals.[5]\n\nA few people have dug tunnels as a hobby or for fun, although some have given additional reasons for their activities. Seymour Cray, for instance, said that the work of digging helped him to think about other problems, and Harrison Dyar saw digging as a form of exercise.\n\nSome hobbyists started out constructing something useful, but continued digging after completion. This was the case with William Lyttle, who started by digging a wine cellar,[6] and Michael Altmann, who excavated a cooling cellar for a café. A Swiss contemporary of Altmann named Peter Junker dug in his garden, searching for water,[7] but continued digging after finding some, excavating a tunnel length of 220 metres (720 ft).[8]\n\nOthers maintain that they excavated for a particular purpose, although their tunnelling effort seems out of proportion to the stated purpose.[2] Dyar biographer Marc Epstein thinks it is mainly outsiders that desire a sense of purpose. On Dyar's tunneling for exercise reasons he says that \"it’s almost unfathomable, the amount of energy it would take\" and that \"it still doesn’t add up\".[2]\n\nAuthor Will Hunt thinks extensive tunnelling is at least part obsession.[6] Psychiatrist Anton Tölk believes that tunnel digging can be interpreted as a desire to return to the security of the mother's womb,[7] and that as an activity it allows contemplative satisfaction.[7]\n\nBetween 1958 and 2008, Austrian Michael Altmann dug two tunnels of 180 metres (590 ft) combined.[7] At first, he wanted a cooling cellar for a cafe he was to open, but upon completion he could not get a permit.[7] In 1965, he took over another bar, but kept his digging as a hobby. Altmann would mainly use a pickaxe for digging and occasionally explosives, after passing an explosives handling examination at the fire department.[7] He dug a second tunnel branching off from the first one, using a tunnel drilling machine he designed and built himself.[7] In 1962, he installed steel doors on the tunnel system and added a store of emergency rations, with the intention of making it usable as a nuclear bunker.[7]\n\nIn 2008, Altmann reached a block of granite and, considering his age, gave up tunnel digging.[7]\n\nLyova (or Levon) Arakelyan dug a storage cellar under his house on the edge of Yerevan in 1985.[6] When completed, he continued to dig and kept at it for some 23 years, constructing an extensive complex of tunnels, rooms and stairs which extended 21 metres (69 ft) deep into solid rock.[1] Arakelyan stated that he received directions for his work in dreams and visions.[9] The underground spaces were transformed into a museum, called 'Divine Underground', after his death in 2008.[9] Arakelyan never made any money from his tunneling in life, and the museum provides some income for his family.[9]\n\nThe 5th Duke of Portland is known to have been a hobby tunneler, although he did no digging himself that we know of but rather had workmen build his tunnels. An extensive network of underground spaces was constructed at his Welbeck Abbey estate in the 19th century, with a total length of around 24 kilometres (15 mi).[11] It included hallways, a ballroom, a billiards room, a library and a 900 metres (3,000 ft) tunnel from the mansion to the riding house, wide enough for several people to walk in side by side.[11] Some of the spaces were lit by lightwells and at night by gas lighting.[10] Most of the spaces that are known as 'underground' are, more correctly, 'below ground', constructed in a cut-and-cover technique.\n\nFew of the tunnels and rooms were ever used for their intended purpose. Towards the end of his life, the Duke lived as a recluse and very few people got to see him. Spaces that were intended for social gatherings, such as the ballroom, were never used. But the Duke did frequently use the tunnels that allowed him to move about his property mostly unseen.\n\nThe American engineer and supercomputer architect Seymour Cray is known to have been a hobby tunneller.[12] Cray built an 8 by 4 feet (2.4 by 1.2 m) cedar-floored tunnel under his house,[13] explaining that the digging helped him to think about computer designs: \"While I'm digging in the tunnel, the elves will often come to me with solutions to my problem.\"[14]\n\nThe American entomologist Harrison Gray Dyar Jr. constructed a network of tunnels on two occasions, with a length of 400 metres (1,300 ft) combined.[6] His first, under his Washington, D.C. home was accidentally discovered during construction work in 1917, without drawing much attention.[15] It was rediscovered in 1924, when a truck sank through the pavement nearby.[6] The tunnel system led to speculation in the press, not in the least because many German newspapers from the war years of 1917 and 1918 were found in the tunnels.[15] After a few days Dyar came forward as the tunnels' constructor, claiming he had dug them between 1906 and 1916, when he relocated to California.[15]\n\nBack in Washington a few years later, Dyar dug out a second set of tunnels under his new home.[15] The network had concrete lined walls, steel staircases and electric lighting.[15][16] Dyar described hobby tunneling as a kind of exercise for him, saying \"some men play golf, I dig tunnels\".[1]\n\nIn 1904, Sicilian immigrant Baldassare Forestiere bought a 32-acre (13 ha) plot of land in Fresno for horticulture.[17] The hardpan soil however, was unsuited for the fruit trees he intended to plant. While working elsewhere, Forestiere dug a maze of underground and below ground spaces to escape the summer heat of the San Joaquin Valley.[17] He opened up ceilings to let in light and below he planted the fruit trees he wanted in the first place. The complex consists of bedrooms, living spaces, patios, a fish pond and hallways.[17] After his death in 1946, some of the land was sold off and some tunnels filled in, but currently about 8 acres (3.2 ha) have been saved. It is known as the Forestiere Underground Gardens and has a listing in the National Register of Historic Places.[18]\n\nGlen Havens of San Diego, US constructed a maze of tunnels and caverns under his house.[19] Havens started out in 1949, enlarging his barbecue pit, but ended up digging roughly 200 metres (660 ft) of tunnels and underground rooms.[19] Havens enlisted the help of his son and other children in the neighbourhood, who earned pocket money in the process.[20] The underground complex was large enough to hold his daughter's wedding reception in 1960, with some 200 guests attending.[20] Havens ignored building regulations and never got any permit. Local authorities recommended that people not to go inside, but took no further action. A local restaurant is named the \"Haven Pizzeria\" in Havens' honor.[citation needed]\n\nIn the 1960s, Irish civil engineer William Lyttle dug a wine cellar under his Hackney property.[1] Having done so, he said that he had \"found a taste for the thing\" and continued digging for forty years.[21] Eventually, several tunnels on multiple levels led in all directions, under the property and surrounding grounds, some of them 18.2 metres (60 ft) long.[21] After complaints by neighbours, a power supply interruption and a sinkhole in the pavement, the borough had a survey carried out that revealed the extent of the tunneling.[21] Lyttle was evicted and the tunnels were filled with concrete.[21]\n\nWilliam \"Burro\" Schmidt was an American miner who spent 38 years drilling a 636-metre (2,087 ft) tunnel through solid granite.[6] Construction began in 1902, with Schmidt claiming to be building a shortcut from his mining operation to the smelter.[22] When a new road was constructed, rendering his shortcut obsolete, Schmidt carried on his work regardless.[23] He used simple handtools and occasionally explosives for tunneling, carrying out the debris in a wheelbarrow or on the backs of his two donkeys.[22]\n\nCosta Rican miner Manuel Barrantes has built an underground family house, consisting of hallways, bedrooms, conference rooms and a bathroom.[1] The complex, totalling 186 square metres (2,000 sq ft), is used as a home and a museum.[1]\n\nThe Williamson Tunnels are a network of tunnels in Liverpool, England, thought to have been dug under the direction of tobacco merchant Joseph Williamson between 1810 and 1840. Their purpose remains unknown, with some speculating that they were built as a folly.\n\nIn Butler, Pennsylvania, US man Ron Heist created a 50-room dwelling made of salvaged materials from abandoned places in the vicinity. It includes several tunnels Heist dug out and reinforced himself.[24] A documentary film was made about him, entitled Mole Man.[25]\n\nIn 1984, Russian Leonid Murlyanchik had the plan of digging a 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) tunnel towards the house of his beloved Ekaterina.[1] However, after Ekaterina's son objected to the liaison, he changed his intention into building a subway system for his home city of Lebedyan.[1] For 27 years Murlyanchik spent most of his hours, and his pension money, on the project.[1] At his death in 2011 he had completed 300 metres (980 ft) of tunnel, which was subsequently closed off.[1]\n\nIn late 2003, steeplejack and television personality Fred Dibnah began to dig a replica coal mine in the back garden of his home. Using traditional shaft-sinking techniques and the labour of mining friends Alf Molyneux and Jimmy Crooks, the shaft was sunk to a depth of 20 feet (6.1 m) and lined with brick. The work had been undertaken without planning permission, and, when the council eventually found out what was happening, they insisted he apply for planning permission.[26] Dibnah died in 2004.[27]\n\n'Sandland' is a tunnel complex in western Wisconsin created by Eric Sutterlin, a contract mechanical engineer from the Minneapolis area. Sutterlin began digging tunnels in the Jordan Sandstone after purchasing the property in 2011, aided by a network of volunteers in the years since. Sutterlin estimates that as of January 2025, he has contributed more than $100,000 of his own money in developing Sandland. Designed to be an underground crawling maze, the tunnel complex contains a number of turns, dead-ends, and even hosts an underground bar. Future additions are slated to include an underground slide and a standing-level maze section. The site also hosts a number of aboveground attractions, including a decommissioned monorail from the Minnesota Zoo and a treehouse, the latter of which was moved to ground-level for safety reasons.[28]\n\nIn 2015, a 10 metres (33 ft) tunnel was discovered in a Toronto park. After a few days of speculations in media, the use as a terrorist hideout being among them, young construction worker Elton McDonald came forward as its builder.[1] Asked for the purpose of his digging, he answered \"Honestly, I loved it so much. I don't know why I loved it\".[1]\n\nYouTube personality and inventor Colin Furze has constructed an underground bunker and tunnel system under his home and workshop in Stamford, Lincolnshire,\ninitially in 2015 as part of a promotion for Sky television's You, Me and the Apocalypse series.[29]\n\nTikTok creator Kala, or @engineer.everything, has been in the process of creating a tunnel system underneath her suburban home since August 2022.[30]\n\nSeveral urban legends and hoaxes involving private tunnels have appeared in media. One such a story is about an Irishman who dug a tunnel from his bedroom to his local pub, without his wife noticing.[31] In one version of the story, that did the rounds at least between 2014 and 2018, the tunneler is said to have used a spoon for digging.[31]\n\nWhen a tunnel in Calgary was discovered in 2016, a local newspaper ran a do it yourself tunneling manual as a story.[32]\n\nThe 1997 novel The Underground Man is loosely based on the life and tunneling of the 5th Duke of Portland.",

    "description": "As AI job losses rise in the professional sector, many are switching to more traditional trades. But how do they feel about accepting lower pay – and, in some cases, giving up their vocation?",
    "fullText": "As AI job losses rise in the professional sector, many are switching to more traditional trades. But how do they feel about accepting lower pay – and, in some cases, giving up their vocation?\n\nCalifornia-based Jacqueline Bowman had been dead set on becoming a writer since she was a child. At 14 she got her first internship at her local newspaper, and later she studied journalism at university. Though she hadn’t been able to make a full-time living from her favourite pastime – fiction writing – post-university, she consistently got writing work (mostly content marketing, some journalism) and went freelance full-time when she was 26. Sure, content marketing wasn’t exactly the dream, but she was writing every day, and it was paying the bills – she was happy enough.\n\n“But something really switched in 2024,” Bowman, now 30, says. Layoffs and publication closures meant that much of her work “kind of dried up. I started to get clients coming to me and talking about AI,” she says – some even brazen enough to tell her how “great” it was “that we don’t need writers any more”. She was offered work as an editor – checking and altering work produced by artificial intelligence. The idea was that polishing up already-written content would take less time than writing it from scratch, so Bowman’s fee was reduced to about half of what it had been when she was writing for the same content marketing agency – but, in reality, it ended up taking double the time.\n\n“I now had to meticulously fact-check every single thing in the articles. And at least 60% of it would be completely made up,” she says. “I would just end up rewriting most of the article. So something that would take me two hours when I was writing it by myself now took me four hours, making half the money.”\n\nTo add insult to injury, Bowman’s few remaining clients have sometimes accused her of using AI to create her work. “I never use AI to write anything,” she says, but she has noticed that AI-produced copy can sometimes seem eerily similar to her own writing – which she suspects is due to large language models being trained on some of her previous work. She can’t afford to take any of the Silicon Valley giants to court – though she is grateful for the authors, like George Saunders and Ta-Nehisi Coates, who have done so.\n\nShe remembered a psychology elective she had enjoyed in college, and wondered if she might be able to make a more secure living by becoming a therapist. “It’s not AI-proof” – Bowman admits that some people will be happy to use AI-powered therapy services, which already exist. “But there’s another subsection of people who are going to say: ‘Hey, AI took my job, AI ruined my life. I’m not going to go to an AI therapist,’” she says. “So in that way, I do think that there’s still going to be an audience who wants a human therapist.”\n\nBowman decided to take action and retrain, “while I still do have a little bit of work”, and is now back at university studying to become a marriage and family therapist. She counts herself “incredibly lucky” because she is able to rely on her husband, and on any writing work she can still get, to make ends meet – but has still had to take out loans. She’s enjoying the course, and is “glad she has the opportunity to do it”, but it is not something she would have considered if her writing work hadn’t become untenable.\n\nJanet Feenstra, an academic editor turned baker based in Malmö, Sweden, also has mixed feelings about her career change, a choice she similarly made because of fears that AI would make her old job void. “It’s complicated because, in a way, I maybe should be grateful to AI for prompting this change,” she says. Feenstra now works at “a really cute bakery”, where she and her colleagues “roll out the dough by hand and it feels amazing”.\n\n“We listen to music and we dance and sing whenever we want,” she adds. “I have a lot more fun now, but I don’t want to be grateful to AI for this – I’m still a little bit bitter.” It felt like a forced career change, rather than one she was choosing on her own terms, she explains – not to mention the fact that she now gets paid less, travels farther to work and does a much more tiring job.\n\nSince 2013, the 52-year-old, who is originally from the US, had been working as a freelance editor alongside a part-time job at Malmö University doing what is called “language editing”: tidying up texts written by researchers whose first language isn’t English.\n\n“The standard of English here in Sweden is very, very high, so this was very specialised academic editing,” she says. “The international journals are very picky, so it required a certain expertise that we could offer.” However, in recent years, she began to hear people within the university talking about wanting to use AI. “It was scary. I felt like the writing was on the wall a bit,” Feenstra says. She began to realise that if a manuscript “is already quite good”, then an AI system prompted to meet academic journal requirements might be able to do the work she had been doing.\n\n“I didn’t want to wait until it was too late,” she says. “I felt scared … I’m divorced, I have two children to look after and I need financial security.” So she decided to retrain in something she “was fairly sure that AI would not replace anytime soon”, and enrolled in culinary school.\n\nIt wasn’t an easy transition. “I had to move out because I wasn’t able to afford my rent any more,” she says, which meant that her sons, who had previously lived between their parents’ two homes, had to live full-time with their father. While Feenstra embarked on her year-long training, she moved in with her partner, whose flat was too small to house her sons as well. Now, having worked in the bakery for five months, she has recently signed a contract on a new flat, which will have room for her sons. “I’ve had to work really hard: I’ve had to retrain, I’ve had to accept lower pay and conditions that are physically challenging,” Feenstra says. But securing the flat “is really exciting because it’s a goal realised”.\n\nFeenstra says it has been “an interesting journey” to go from a job typically associated with middle-class people to one seen as working-class. “White-collar work isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, I’ve realised,” she says. “But it requires an adjustment. We’re so defined by our jobs and our class.”\n\nPerhaps those definitions of what counts as a “good” or “middle class” job will begin to change: a 2023 report on the impact of AI on jobs and training in the UK by the Department for Education concluded that: “Professional occupations are more exposed to AI, particularly those associated with more clerical work and across finance, law and business management roles.” And, rightly or wrongly, Feenstra is not alone in deciding that learning a trade is a relatively safe bet.\n\nAngela Joyce, the CEO of Capital City College, a further education provider in London, says: “We’re seeing a steady growth in students of all ages coming to us to do trades-based qualifications,” in subjects such as engineering, culinary arts and childcare. There is “definitely a shift” away from traditional academic routes, she says, which she attributes to the high numbers of unemployed young people – and “a good proportion of those are graduates”, she notes. That shift towards seeking vocational training is “in part linked to AI”, Joyce thinks, because people are looking for “jobs that AI can’t replace”.\n\nThat was certainly the case for Richard, a Northampton-based chartered occupational health and safety professional. After working his way up the career ladder for 15 years, the 39-year-old decided to jump ship and retrain as an electrical engineer.\n\n“Health and safety isn’t going to disappear any time soon because organisations can’t name AI as a responsible person or a duty holder for businesses legally,” he says. But a few years ago, he started to hear “mumblings of AI” within the industry, and saw organisations start to experiment with automating certain systems and procedures. He watched as AI began to be used for writing policies and safe systems of work, and realised that if a large portion of practitioners’ workload could be done by AI, then there might only be a need for “highly specialised managers. The rest of it’s probably going to go.”\n\nThough he decided to “pre-empt that” and pursue a different path, his main worry about AI taking over health and safety roles wasn’t actually that people like him would lose jobs – he finds aspects of AI “exciting” and accepts that it will inevitably shake up the way we work. His primary concern was that the implementation of AI might be “more of a cost-cutting exercise than it is about safety”. Richard cares deeply about the health and safety industry, which he entered after his friend was killed in a gas explosion at work.\n\nHe has taken “a huge cut” financially since he has been working as an electrical engineer over the past year, but his new job does at least still have keeping people safe at its core. And there is the potential to make the kind of money he earned in his old job once he has more experience under his belt, he says, but “I’m a good five, 10 years off”. And that’s if automation hasn’t come for electrical work by then – Richard mentions BMW’s testing of a humanoid robot as an example of how AI could affect trade jobs. Currently, though, the trades, in the UK at least, are “the most resilient to the levels of automation that AI is bringing in”, Richard believes. “Companies are capitalising on AI to remove one of their biggest costs, which is human overheads,” he says. “You need to pick something which has resilience. So, statistically, that is not your roles that are bureaucratic by nature, heavy in data and are just a bunch of processes which you repeat end on end. It needs to be something with high dexterity and some high problem-solving skills.”\n\nCarl Benedikt Frey, an associate professor of AI and work at the Oxford Internet Institute, agrees that manual work “is going to be harder to automate”, but predicts that AI will have an impact “across a very wide range of industries” – trades included. “If the dishwasher breaks down in my home, I can take a picture and I can quiz the large language model of my choice, and I’m more likely to be able to fix it myself these days without calling an engineer,” he says. That’s not to say tradespeople are “doomed” – he cautions against making too many decisions based on “some hypothetical future scenario … We have to go by what’s actually happening in the labour market.” Which, now, is not a lot. “We’re beginning to see some studies suggesting more of an impact on entry-level work,” Frey says, but a reduction in entry-level job opportunities could also be attributed to higher interest rates, or post-pandemic recovery, he says.\n\n“As AI gets better, and its capabilities improve, I think it’s likely that we will see it on a bigger slice of the labour market. But we’re not seeing it yet.” In fact, Frey has now reassessed his earlier claim that 47% of roles were at risk of being replaced by computerisation, made in The Future of Employment, the 2013 paper he co-authored with Prof Michael Osborne. “In that study, a lot of the jobs that we deem are highly exposed to automation are jobs in transportation and logistics because of autonomous vehicles,” he says. “It’s fair to say that it’s taken much longer for that technology to materialise.” As self-driving cars do begin to hit our streets, “we will see a lot of jobs being replaced in trucking and even in taxi services”, Frey believes. But his message seems to be don’t panic – at least not yet. “It might be a good idea if you are, say, in the early days of your professional career, to take the time that you still have to invest in training and figuring out other more viable career paths,” particularly if you work as a translator – one profession where “we’re already seeing that AI is having an impact, although we’re not seeing mass displacement by any means”. But if you are reaching the end of your working life, “you can probably ride the wave for a few more years”, he says.\n\nThe most significant AI-caused declines in employment and wages will be in jobs like software engineering and management consultancy, according to a King’s College London study published in October 2025. “That doesn’t necessarily mean that there aren’t going to be new jobs that will be created,” Dr Bouke Klein Teeselink, who authored that study, notes. Historically, whenever there have been technological advances people have worried about mass unemployment, but it hasn’t happened, he says. “So there’s a part of me that is a little bit sceptical that all the jobs will disappear, but at the same time there is a reason to think that this technology might be different, in the sense that humans always maintained some type of absolute advantage over technology in certain domains. And that may no longer be true.”\n\nFor now, while we can’t yet know the full impact AI will have on workers, “becoming really good at working with AI is probably going to be a skill that will pay off”, Klein advises. Which is what the Birmingham-based entrepreneurs Fayyaz Garda and Arun Singh Aujla, both 25, are attempting to do. Garda, who works in procurement, and Singh Aujla, who runs a social media marketing business, are in the process of setting up an AI consulting business, educating themselves about AI via YouTube. “It’s a growing market, and there’s definitely a space for it. So I’m hoping to try and get in there early,” Garda says. The plan is to employ a number of engineers to create AI systems that will answer phone calls, respond to mail and fulfil other tasks businesses need doing, he explains.\n\n“The AI consulting business is one way I’m upskilling to move with the times,” Singh Aujla adds. “AI won’t replace me, but it may take a large market share out of my business. So it’s always good to make an extra stream of revenue.” There are certain roles Singh Aujla would never replace with AI, though: “I would not replace my management team. You need that human interaction with your team,” he says. “But roles the team don’t want to do, like email outreach and cold calling, we can get AI agents to do that.”\n\nFor some, it may well prove true that AI improves their work life by removing tasks they find tedious or difficult, giving them more time to focus on the more fulfilling aspects of their job. For others, though, it is the reason they have given up on their dream career. Paola Adeitan, 31, had her heart set on being a solicitor, and obtained an undergraduate degree and a master’s in law. She had planned to do the legal practice course, the final stage of training needed to qualify as a solicitor, “but I decided not to pursue that path because I felt like, with the change in technology, the AI, that might not be a viable path for me to carry on with,” she says. Friends of hers had struggled to get entry-level law roles, which she believed to be partly due to the increased use of AI at law firms.\n\nAdeitan still volunteers as a legal adviser, but her day job is in the health sector – although even that role could be affected by AI, she thinks, so she is remaining open to the idea that she might end up retraining again. “I do feel a sense of disappointment,” she says, “but the nature of work is changing. It’s very difficult now to decide what you want to do; you have to think carefully. It’s not about what you want any more; it’s about what is going to be there, what’s going to work.”\n\nIf you’re lucky, what ends up working best could be something you really enjoy – as is the case for Faz, 23, who took a break from his geography degree at the University of Manchester in 2023 because of a family matter. Afterwards, it didn’t make sense to him to return to his degree. “I had to think about what was future-proof, I had to think about what was AI-proof. And it seemed like a lot of entry-level roles in the corporate sector were being taken over by AI. And because AI is so unpredictable, you never know if those more specialised roles will also become obsolete,” he says. So he has instead been training for a Level 2 qualification in electrical installation since September 2025. “I thoroughly enjoy it,” he says. Though he might go back to university at some point – his “ideal setup” would be a combination of working part-time for a council or a charity, while doing electrical work on the side – “right now, a tradie job is 100%, God willing, the correct choice. I’m fairly certain it will be future-proofed against AI.”\n\nBethan, 24, from Bristol, also enjoys her AI-proof job, working in a local cafe. But it comes at a cost: she has hypermobility spectrum disorder, which gives her severe joint pain and makes it hard for her to move around. “I can’t work long hours now because I’ve pushed my body past the point,” she says.\n\nBethan’s old job, at a university IT helpdesk, “was the first job that I didn’t come home in pain from”, she says. But only a couple of months after she was hired, she and her colleagues were told the helpdesk was being closed down and replaced with an AI kiosk. “It was awful,” she says. The helpdesk staff tried to defend their roles, arguing that for students who didn’t speak English as a first language, or older students who weren’t computer-literate, having humans behind the desk may still be necessary. “It felt like we were getting completely ignored. They went ahead with it because they said they had to get a certain number of cuts to the budget.”\n\nHospitality was the only other sector in which she had experience, so she ended up at her cafe job. “Feeling like I had to go back to hospitality, which was so bad for my body, was a horrible feeling,” she says. She is now on the lookout for an office job, but has struggled to find anything entry-level. “Those are the jobs that are vanishing because they’re the easiest to replace,” she says – but it also means it is impossible to get the experience needed for higher-up roles. Bethan worries that even if she does get an office job, she could lose it to AI again. “Is it worth all the effort of applying, getting my CV up to date, and potentially doing a couple of rounds of interviews just to find out at the end we’re going to be replaced again?”\n\nWith more physically demanding jobs making up the bulk of what is now considered “AI-proof”, those who have made the switch from white-collar roles are having to adapt to the toll it takes on their bodies. The electricians Richard works with are typically in their late teens and early 20s. “Their recovery rates are a hell of a lot quicker than mine. So if I pick up an injury, for example, it takes me far longer to recuperate. Also, they can work far longer hours than I can,” he says.\n\nAnd though Feenstra enjoys the physicality of working in a bakery, she has been thinking about how sustainable this kind of job will be as she gets older. “That’s why I’ve been taking note of how the owners run the business,” she says, in case there is a possibility of running her own bakery one day. She is proud of how she is continuing to adapt to the changing world around her: “I want my sons to feel a little bit inspired by that,” she says. Yet she doesn’t feel she can offer them career advice. “How am I supposed to advise them when I don’t even really know if what I’m doing is the right path?” she says. “It’s really unsettling when you can’t advise them. If they have a passion for something and they want to do something, immediately you think, OK, is this even going to exist in the next 10, 20 years? That just kind of sucks.”\n\nBallerinas will still exist, says Klein. “No one is going to go to the ballet to see a robot do really good ballet,” the academic says. “Same for theatre, same for football, same for many other things where it matters that there’s a human.” He doesn’t think people will be wanting to confess to robo-priests any time soon either, or leave children in the care of AI. “There are just categories where we prefer to interact with humans, right?” For that reason, social skills will remain important, Klein and Frey agree. And though it might seem as if AI could make expert knowledge useless, Klein disagrees. “I have students who use AI naively, and therefore they have no idea whether the reports they produce are good or bad,” he says. “You need to have that expertise to be able to guide the AI to get it to do what you need it to do. So in that sense, I think the value of expertise might actually go up.”\n\nHow such expertise will be developed, if entry-level jobs are being ditched in favour of AI systems, is a question that remains as yet unanswered, as is who will actually be able to buy a ticket to the ballet should large swathes of the population be put out of work. But Frey doesn’t think it is worth spending too much time worrying about that potential future – yet. “It could well arrive, but it matters a great deal if that happens in five years or 20.” While he acknowledges “there are reasons to be concerned”, Frey doesn’t think it’s time to “paint a scenario where everybody’s going to be out of work five years from now, and we need to rethink everything”.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — In China, consumerism appears to outweigh nationalism regardless of how testy relations have become in recent diplomatic spats with countries like Japan and the United States.\n\nIt has been common practice for the ruling Communist Party to whip up nationalist sentiment and deploy propaganda condemning countries deemed to be violating China's stance on territorial issues as Taiwan and Tibet. At times, Beijing targets companies that make ideological missteps in their maps or advertising.\n\nIn the past, friction with Japan and the United States has led to calls for mass boycotts, protests in the streets or even vandalism on embassies or restaurants. These days, pure nationalism appears not to resonate so much with Chinese consumers accustomed to making their own personal consumption choices.\n\n“Chinese consumers, especially urban middle-class and younger demographics, are not making everyday purchasing decisions based on nationalism,” said Jacob Cooke, CEO of Beijing-based consultancy WPIC Marketing + Technologies.\n\nJapan still sells despite tensions\n\nBeijing reacted with outrage to Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's comment, not long after she took office in October, that an attack on Taiwan, the self-ruled island China claims as its territory, might require a military intervention by Tokyo.\n\nChinese officials have condemned the remark and moved to restrict some trade with Japan. Warnings to Chinese travelers not to visit Japan, an ultra-popular destination, have had a notable impact on its tourism industry.\n\nBe that as it may, huge crowds turned up to the opening of an outlet of Sushiro at a Shanghai mall in December.\n\nThe Japan-based conveyor-belt sushi chain has become a smash success since it opened its first branch in mainland China in 2021.\n\n“It tastes good,” said Edith Xiao, a 23-year-old university student who lined up outside a Sushiro restaurant in a Beijing mall for more than half an hour to get in. “The quality of the ingredients is guaranteed.”\n\nXiao is also a fan of the Japanese manga and anime series Chiikawa, whose cherubic, hamster-like cartoon character is popular among Chinese.\n\nThe broader state of China-Japan relations has had little impact on her own consumption of Japanese culture or restaurants, she said.\n\n“It’s just statements made by leaders. It doesn’t represent a change in the attitude of people of the country,” she explained.\n\nAmerican culture appeals to Chinese consumers\n\nTensions between the Chinese and U.S. governments over tariffs, Taiwan and other issues also don’t appear to be causing Chinese to punish American brands.\n\nDisney’s Zootopia 2 is a huge hit in China, where its fans, many in cosplay of its characters, helped make it one of the biggest global cinematic hits of 2025.\n\nIt became the highest grossing Hollywood film in China on record with more than 4.4 billion yuan ($634 million) in revenue, according to Chinese entertainment data provider Beacon Pro.\n\nDespite a government push to promote and subsidize homegrown movies to make China a “strong film power” by 2035, Chinese film-goers say they welcome an escape into foreign cinematics.\n\nZootopia 2 was a light-hearted option, said Ruan Wenlin, who watched the movie in Beijing. “It was so hilarious,” she said.\n\nMany Chinese consumers are “tired, exhausted and anxious from COVID and from the weak economy,” said Shaun Rein, managing director at China Market Research Group. “People are watching Hollywood movies, especially cartoons like Zootopia, because they’re stressed out and just want something to relax themselves,” he said.\n\nRalph Lauren, the New York-based fashion brand, meanwhile has been building on its “old money” and quiet luxury aesthetic to win favor with urban middle-class Chinese who are prioritizing quality and value over nationalism, analysts say.\n\nAmerican fashions appeal to many, despite often fraught relations between Beijing and Washington. Ralph Lauren’s sales have grown faster in China than in Europe or North America.\n\n“What attracts me most is its stable brand image and design,” said Zhang Tianyu, who was shopping recently at a Ralph Lauren outlet in Beijing.\n\nAmerican brands that are succeeding are doing so because they genuinely meet consumer needs or represent a lifestyle Chinese consumers want to associate with, not because of country-of-origin alone, said Cooke from WPIC Marketing + Technologies.\n\nEvolving patterns as ‘patriotic buying’ trend shifts\n\nAs a wave of patriotic buying of Chinese brands — dubbed “guochao,” or national tide in Chinese — has evolved and matured, many consumers have grown comfortable with both foreign and domestic brands.\n\n“Chinese (people) have stopped buying just for the sake of buying Chinese brands,\" said Rein from China Market Research Group. Consumers are “scared about the economy, they’re anxious about their job prospects. So they’ll just buy whatever brand, domestic, Chinese or foreign, fits their definition of value and lifestyle,” he said.\n\nCompared with a decade ago, nationalist sentiment has less influence on consumer behavior, analysts said.\n\nIn 2012, Chinese crowds gathered for anti-Japan protests over a territorial dispute, smashed Japanese brand cars and vandalized Japanese restaurants. There were calls to shun Japanese goods.\n\nLikewise in 2021, Western brands including Nike were hit with boycotts in China due to disputes over political issues such as Beijing's treatment of members of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, in the country's far west.\n\nMore recently, controversies like a Pokemon card game event that was originally planned to be held at a shrine to honor Japan’s war dead still triggered angry comments on Chinese social media, but no obvious broader repercussions.\n\n“We may believe that all Chinese consumers should follow Beijing’s direction of discarding foreign influence, which is misleading,” said Yaling Jiang, an independent Chinese consumer analyst. “Geopolitics does not dictate business flows on the local level.”\n\nShoppers often will just mix and match to suit their own tastes, Jiang said.\n\nThe ascent of strong Chinese brands has emerged as a key challenge for foreign companies. From electric vehicles to smart phones to athletic wear, local companies are fast gaining market share both at home and abroad.\n\n“Chinese will choose Chinese brands because they’re better, better value, better quality, better pricing,” said Rein.\n\nAfter the government declared that travelers should avoid trips to Japan, employees of state-owned companies and government agencies, as well as travel agencies, fell in line. Hundreds of flights operated by China’s major state-owned airlines, and Japan-bound group tours, were cancelled.\n\nThe number of Chinese visitors to Japan fell 45% in December from a year earlier, to about 330,400. Many Chinese are still traveling to Japan individually, despite earlier warnings from officials, often while keeping a low-profile on social media.\n\nAP’s Beijing newsroom contributed to this story.",

    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nAn Australian scientist says probabilities are the leading cause of the Bermuda Triangle disappearances.\n\nAdd in suspect weather, and iffy plane and boat piloting, and Karl Kruszelnicki believes there’s no reason to believe in the Bermuda Triangle phenomenon.\n\nWhile the conspiracy of the Bermuda Triangle has existed for decades, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association and Lloyd’s of London has long championed the same ideas.\n\nPick any one of the more than 50 ships or 20 planes that have disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle in the last century. Each one has a story without an ending, leading to a litany of conspiracy theories about the disappearances in the area, marked roughly by Florida, Bermuda, and the Greater Antilles.\n\nAustralian scientist Karl Kruszelnicki doesn’t Neither does the United States’ own National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA). Both have been saying for years that there’s really no Bermuda Triangle mystery. In fact, the loss and disappearance of ships and planes is a mere fact of probabilities.\n\n“There is no evidence that mysterious disappearances occur with any greater frequency in the Bermuda Triangle than in any other large, well-traveled area of the ocean,” NOAA wrote in 2010.\n\nAnd since 2017, Kruszelnicki has been saying the same thing. He told The Independent that the transparent volume of traffic—in a tricky area to navigate, no less—shows “the number [of ships and planes] that go missing in the Bermuda Triangle is the same as anywhere in the world on a percentage basis.” He says that both Lloyd’s of London and the U.S. Coast Guard support that idea. In fact, as The Independent notes, Lloyd’s of London has had this same theory since the 1970s.\n\nNOAA says environmental considerations can explain away most of the Bermuda Triangle disappearances, highlighting the Gulf Stream’s tendency towards violent changes in weather, the number of islands in the Caribbean Sea offering a complicated navigation adventure, and evidence that suggests the Bermuda Triangle may cause a magnetic compass to point to true north instead of magnetic north, causing for confusion in wayfinding.\n\n“The U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard contend that there are no supernatural explanations for disasters at sea,” NOAA says. “Their experience suggests that the combined forces of nature and human fallibility outdo even the most incredulous science fiction.”\n\nKruszelnicki has routinely garnered public attention for espousing these very thoughts on the Bermuda Triangle, first in 2017 and then again in 2022 before resurfacing once more in 2023. Throughout it all, he’s stuck to the same idea: the numbers don’t lie.\n\nEven with some high-profile disappearances—such as Flight 19, a group of five U.S. Navy TBM Avenger torpedo bombers lost in 1945—pushing the theory into popular culture, Kruszelnicki points out that every instance contains a degree of poor weather or likely human error (or both, as in the case of Flight 19) as the true culprit.\n\nBut culture clings to Bermuda Triangle conspiracy theories. The concepts of sea monsters, aliens, and even the entirety of Atlantis dropping to the ocean floor—those are fodder for books, television, and movies. It sure does sound more exciting than poor weather and mathematical probabilities, anyway, even if the “boring” story holds more water.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito has offered a cryptic observation about his former colleague and mentor, the late conservative justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nScalia, who was appointed to the bench in 1986 and became one of its most influential conservative members, died unexpectedly in his sleep at age 79, in early 2016.\n\nAfter his death, Alito—who has served on the Supreme Court since 2006—continued Scalia’s judicial legacy by authoring the Dobbs v. Jackson decision overturning the constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nHis decision drew heavily from dissents that Scalia had authored in previous cases upholding the right to an abortion, Alito told journalist and author James Rosen in a new interview published in Politico.\n\nBut while Scalia would have no doubt been happy that the court now boasts an entrenched 6-3 conservative majority, he would have been less enthusiastic about the state of American politics, which have grown “coarser and more polarized than ever before,” Rosen wrote.\n\n“He would have been appalled at so much,” Alito told Rosen.\n\nThe 75-year-old did not elaborate, though he apparently agreed with one of Scalia’s children that the timing of the justice’s death meant he was spared from witnessing “so much that would have upset him,” as Rosen put it.\n\nA few months after Scalia died, President Donald Trump was named the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nTrump went on to win the general election in November and appoint Scalia’s successor, Neil Gorsuch, after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell kept the seat vacant for more than a year in order to prevent President Barack Obama from filling it.\n\nSince then, the court has been rocked by a series of scandals, including Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s disastrous confirmation hearings in 2018, during which Christine Blasey Ford accused him of sexual assault, which he denied.\n\nA few years later, in 2022, a draft version of Alito’s decision in Dobbs was leaked to Politico. If the leak came up during Rosen’s 90-minute interview with Alito, the author didn’t mention it.\n\nSubsequent leaks have revealed disagreements among the justices, including a bitter debate over the court’s toothless ethics rules, and a confidential memo in which Chief Justice John Roberts pushed to grant Trump broad immunity from prosecution.\n\nThe court is also facing record-low public trust as Alito and the other conservative justices have greenlit the vast majority of Trump’s policies, while the justices themselves face unprecedented security risks.\n\n“Even since Nino died, things are so different,” Alito told Rosen, using a nickname for Scalia reserved for close friends and family. “I so often wish he were still here. He started so much and it would have been good to have him around to see it to completion.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the Supreme Court for comment.",

    "fullText": "The US Food and Drug Administration has refused to accept an application from Moderna to review its first mRNA seasonal flu vaccine, the company said Tuesday, in another setback for the technology that’s been a target of some Trump administration health officials.\n\nThe agency told Moderna that its application didn’t contain an “adequate and well-controlled” trial because the control arm didn’t reflect the “best-available standard of care in the United States at the time of the study,” according to a letter dated February 3 that Moderna posted online. It didn’t identify any safety or efficacy concerns, the company said.\n\nModerna said that the refusal was inconsistent with previous feedback from the agency and that it had requested a meeting with FDA officials to understand how to proceed.\n\n“The complete stunner here is at no point in any of this did anybody say that it was not adequate” to run its clinical trial the way it had discussed with the agency, Moderna’s president, Dr. Stephen Hoge, told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services said “the FDA generally does not comment on regulatory communications to individual sponsors.” It’s rare for the FDA to issue a “refuse-to-file” letter; a 2021 study of almost 2,500 applications submitted to the agency found that only 4% received such letters.\n\nModerna used a standard-dose seasonal flu vaccine called Fluarix as a comparator in a 40,700-person clinical trial to demonstrate the experimental mRNA vaccine’s safety and efficacy. The company said the FDA had agreed with that plan in April 2024 but suggested it also include data comparing its vaccine with an approved high-dose flu vaccine for people over 65, which the company said it did.\n\nModerna added that as recently as August, in a meeting before it submitted its application for approval of the vaccine, the FDA suggested that it would review the filing and assess issues with the comparator during that process. The agency did note that there could be a “significant issue” with the data “during review” of the application, according to written feedback that Moderna shared.\n\nBut last week, the agency refused to do the review at all, according to the letter. It was signed by Dr. Vinay Prasad, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which oversees vaccine regulation.\n\nPrasad was an outspoken critic of the government’s response to Covid-19 before he was appointed to the FDA under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He claimed late last year without providing details that Covid-19 vaccines resulted in deaths of 10 children and has said the agency will change its vaccine approval process.\n\nModerna is one of three manufacturers in the US of approved Covid-19 vaccines, along with Pfizer and Novavax. Moderna and Pfizer’s vaccines use mRNA technology. Pfizer also has mRNA-based flu vaccines in development.\n\nAlthough the record-speed development of mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccines during the pandemic was a chief accomplishment of Trump’s first term, his second administration has withdrawn support for mRNA technology in infectious diseases. HHS canceled 22 projects worth about $500 million focused on mRNA vaccine development in August, claiming against evidence that “these vaccines fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu.”\n\nCovid-19 vaccines are estimated to have saved millions of lives. The hope behind applying mRNA technology to seasonal flu vaccines is that it could improve how well they work, enable tailoring for geographic regions where different strains are circulating and lead to combinations with Covid-19 vaccines so people would need only one shot for protection against both viruses.\n\nWith currently approved technology, experts select flu strains for each fall’s seasonal vaccines during the preceding February. Hoge pointed out that mRNA vaccines can be manufactured much faster; for Covid-19 vaccines, he said, the design is decided in May or June, for shipping by August.\n\nChoosing the strains closer to the start of flu season could potentially lead to a better match with circulating viruses, “and better matching equals, usually, better protection,” Hoge said.\n\nModerna’s phase 3 study showed in results reported in June that the mRNA-based flu shot produced efficacy that was about 27% higher than Fluarix in adults 50 and older. A separate trial that assessed safety and immune response included the comparison with a high-dose flu vaccine for people 65 and older and showed superiority, Moderna said.\n\nImmune response is assessed in the laboratory by analyzing blood samples of people who’ve been vaccinated, while efficacy assessments typically involve seeing how well a vaccine protects against cases of the disease.\n\nModerna had been awaiting the start of the review of its flu shot before it moved its experimental combination flu and Covid-19 mRNA vaccine into the FDA review process, Hoge said. That’s now on hold as the company awaits a meeting and further guidance from the agency.\n\nMeanwhile, the combination vaccine is moving forward in other countries.\n\n“We do expect that our first approval will be … probably in Europe, and this year,” Hoge said. “So that’ll be a milestone event.”",

    "fullText": "Sen. Kevin Harris (D-Prince George's) speaks with Sen. Brian Feldman (D-Montgomery) on the Senate floor Tuesday. Harris introduced a bill that could let utility companies to build and operate power-generation infrastructure. (Photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)\n\nSen. Kevin Harris is not sure his bill allowing investor-owned utilities to get back in the business of generating power — and using ratepayer dollars to do so — is the answer to high energy prices and constrained demand in the state.\n\nBut the Prince George’s County Democrat is sure that something needs to be done.\n\n“We need to have all possible options out there for the state of Maryland. Who knows if this is the right one, but we won’t know until we actually do the deep dive, have the discussions and figure out what’s best for our constituents,” said Harris of Senate Bill 954 that he is sponsoring.\n\nThe bill, which lays out a pathway for investor-owned electric utilities to use ratepayer dollars to build power generation infrastructure in Maryland, has the support of Exelon — the owner of Baltimore Gas & Electric, Delmarva Power and Pepco. The Chicago-based utility has been campaigning hard for the idea, including in TV commercials that aired in Maryland during the Super Bowl.\n\nBut consumer advocates and environmental groups argue that putting additional costs on the backs of customers would be deeply harmful amid already-high costs. They warn that high infrastructure spending by utilities is part of the reason for the current high rates, and allowing further construction would make matters worse.\n\nMaryland People’s Counsel David Lapp, who is tasked with representing utility ratepayers in the state, said in a statement that he believes “the Exelon bill is anything but affordable.”\n\n“Turning new business over to Exelon unnecessarily exposes customers to the Exelon utilities’ long record of exceeding cost projections and of cost overruns,” Lapp said.\n\nIn Maryland, the utilities, which control the distribution of power to homes and businesses across the state, are separate from the companies that generate power and supply it to the grid.\n\nThe utilities enjoy monopolies in their service territories and are regulated by the Public Service Commission, which presides over the costs they can pass on to customers. Utilities receive reimbursement of approved infrastructure costs, and a guaranteed profit on top of that, often 9% or higher.\n\nCurrent law technically states that the PSC “may require or allow investor-owned electric company to construct, acquire, or lease, and operate, its own generating facilities … subject to appropriate cost recovery.”\n\nHarris’ bill is considerably more specific.\n\nThe bill directs the PSC to require one or more electric companies to submit plans involving power generation, if it determines that there is a power scarcity, or that an event impacting “price stability” has occurred. The commission then has one year to approve or deny the plans.\n\nHarris said that his bill, called the Affordable Energy Act, would only allow the utilities to build renewable energy projects, but not fossil fuel projects.\n\nValencia McClure, senior vice president of government, regulatory and external affairs for Exelon’s Maryland utilities, said her company wants to focus on operating community solar farms and battery storage infrastructure, not natural gas generation. She noted that power customers who \n\n“We really are focusing on: How can we support our customers during this affordability crisis?” McClure said. “The way to do that is to — if called upon by the state — to be able to build new generation.”\n\nBut Lapp said Maryland consumers should not be paying for any increased power generation in the state through their rates, since much of the predicted strain on the regional grid isn’t actually coming from Maryland. It’s largely coming from data centers projected for other states, he said.\n\nHouse caps amount of utility employee salaries that can come out of ratepayers’ pockets\n\n“PJM projects that the Maryland Exelon utilities’ power demands decrease — not increase — through 2029.” Lapp wrote. “Aside from some relatively small data center growth in Maryland compared to PJM — growth that existing customers should not be responsible for — the Exelon utilities’ energy demands only go up modestly starting in 2030, at a growth rate much lower than historical growth rates.”\n\nHarris’ bill explicitly states that the electric utilities required or authorized to construct power facilities can recover all of their costs from ratepayers — even if some of those costs are stranded, including if the infrastructure is never built.\n\n“That’s one of the things that we would be discussing further and see what is actually needed and what is not needed,” Harris said.\n\nLapp argues that the provision is alarming.\n\n“It would give utilities unprecedented statutory protection from the consequences of building power plants that turn out to be unnecessary — a real possibility given the vast evidence suggesting that projections of data center energy demands are inflated,” Lapp wrote.\n\nIn a statement, BGE spokesperson Nick Alexopulos said the company supports the measure “to make sure a large generation project doesn’t jeopardize the utility’s health or lead to higher debt costs overall, which would adversely impact customers.”\n\nIt’s unclear whether the bill will be able to advance: Senate President Bill Ferguson said Tuesday that “there is a level of skepticism that exists across the caucus, and across the Senate membership” about whether it will reduce ratepayer costs.\n\n“That’s going to be the lens that we are really trying to hone in on, is whether or not a policy is going to provide long-term savings for the ratepayer,” Ferguson said.\n\nMcClure said Exelon estimates that average customer bills would increase about $2 per month for a few years, but those would turn to savings of $5 to $10 a month in the future. The company’s analysis was based on construction of 2,700 megawatts of battery storage and 1,200 megawatts of solar.\n\nFerguson said that he would “prefer that that the risk” of investment “land with investors.”\n\nSUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE\n\n“But there is a question that if there is a strike price or point where … the market is not generating sufficient domestic generation, whether that has to be some other market intervention to push it,” Ferguson said.\n\nLast year, lawmakers passed the Next Generation Energy Act, which included a fast-track permitting process for “dispatchable” energy projects, which can provide energy for the grid when called upon during peak times. Only two projects have been approved to move through the fast-track, under the legislation’s requirements: Two different concepts for a natural gas plant in Harford County, submitted by Constellation.\n\nConstellation, formerly an Exelon subsidiary, also proposed a battery storage project, but it did not meet requirements of the fast-track bill, even though it created a procurement specifically for battery storage.\n\nConstellation has been opposed to Exelon’s push to enter the generation game, arguing that it would crowd out competitive power producers, and that Exelon is ill-suited to enter the generation fray.\n\n“BGE doesn’t need new law to build new generation,” said Constellation spokesman Paul Adams. “BGE wants new law to guarantee a return on any investment, whether or not that investment is in the best interests of Maryland ratepayers or at the lowest cost. Unlike them, Constellation is ready and willing to put our own capital on the line, with no guarantee of profit. It seems only reasonable that if you aren’t willing to take on any risk, you should take no profit.”",

    "fullText": "(Removes 'downtown' from paragraph 2)\n\nWASHINGTON, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Becky Ringstrom was heading home after following federal immigration officers in her gray Kia SUV in suburban Minneapolis when she was suddenly boxed in by unmarked vehicles. At least a half-dozen masked agents jumped out to arrest her, one knocking on her windshield with a metal object as if threatening to use it to break her window.\n\nAfter the arrest, captured on bystander video verified by Reuters, the 42-year-old mother of seven later said she was transported to Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis where an officer gave her a citation charging her under a ​federal law that criminalizes impeding law enforcement. The official said her name and photo would be added to a government database.\n\nThe arrest of Ringstrom became the latest detention of one of thousands of local activists for violating Title 18, Section 111 of the U.S. Code, a catch-all charge for anyone who “forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes” ‌with a federal officer conducting official duties. The statute can be charged as a felony or misdemeanor. As a felony, it carries up to 20 years in prison, but penalties beyond eight years are reserved for people who use “a deadly or dangerous weapon” or cause an injury.\n\nA Reuters review of federal court records found that the Trump administration has prosecuted at least 655 people under that charge across the U.S. since a series of city-focused immigration crackdowns began last summer. ‌That’s more than double the prosecutions during the same period in 2024-2025, according to a review of publicly available criminal filings in Westlaw, a legal research database owned by Thomson Reuters.\n\nThe charges are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to clamp down on ICE opponents, who they portray as rioters who pose threats to officers and undermine their efforts to arrest immigrants with criminal records.\n\n\"Assaulting and obstructing law enforcement is a felony,\" said U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin. She said federal immigration officers \"used the minimum amount of force necessary to protect themselves, the public, and federal property.\"\n\nICE has been tracking the names of protesters in an internal database for several months, according to two U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss operations.\n\nThe government database contains names, photos, actions that provoked suspicion, locations and license plates, the officials said, adding that the effort was intended to spot patterns that could lead to charges.\n\nDHS said ⁠it does not maintain a database of U.S. “domestic terrorists,” but does track threats. “We do of course monitor and investigate and refer all ‌threats, assaults and obstruction of our officers to the appropriate law enforcement,” McLaughlin said.\n\nOne of the officials said ICE was referring several people per day in Minnesota alone to federal prosecutors for potential charges under the same law for interfering with police operations.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said the Trump administration was committed to protecting First Amendment freedoms, but that people impeding law enforcement \"will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nRingstrom had watched federal immigration officers for about 45 minutes as they sat in a parked car in her neighborhood on Thursday, January 29. When they started to ‍move, she decided to follow along in her SUV, keeping a distance of multiple car lengths behind, she said.\n\nAt a roundabout, a Border Patrol agent approached her car and said, \"Last time I'm going to warn you,\" according to video Ringstrom recorded on her phone.\n\nThe officers went right at a stop sign and she went left, she said. Several minutes later as she started to head back toward her house, multiple vehicles with federal officers stopped and arrested her, she said.\n\n\"I know what I'm doing is not wrong,\" Ringstrom said later in an interview with Reuters.\n\nStill, she said she was terrified when federal officers approached her car. “There was a moment where I thought I could be Renee Good,\" she said, referring to one of the two U.S. citizen protesters fatally shot by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis in January.\n\nAfter her arrest, she was issued a citation, reviewed by Reuters, ​which said the court date was “TBD” - to be determined.\n\nMcLaughlin said Ringstrom \"stalked law enforcement and attempted to obstruct law enforcement from performing their sworn duties.”\n\nSeth Stoughton, a professor focused on policing at University of South Carolina School of Law, said the law in the past mostly has been used to charge assaults on officers and specifically states that the alleged crime must be committed \"forcibly.”\n\n\"Without ‌any physical contact, just following an agent in a car, it's not clear to me that that's resistance or impeding in the first place, and it certainly seems like a stretch to establish that as forcible,\" Stoughton said.\n\nA federal judge in Minneapolis said in a mid-January order that a vehicle following ICE at “an appropriate distance” did not justify a traffic stop or arrest, but that order was paused by an appeals court 10 days later.\n\nThe judge’s now-paused order did not say what exact distance would be deemed safe.\n\nDeborah Fleischaker, a top ICE official under former President Joe Biden, said it was “inappropriate and unconstitutional” to intimidate and arrest people peacefully following immigration officers in their cars.\n\n“Observing ICE activities is not a crime and should not be treated as such,” she said.\n\nMcLaughlin said U.S. Border Patrol agents at the scene gave Ringstrom \"lawful commands and warnings\" but that she continued to obstruct operations, leading to her arrest.\n\n\"When agitators willingly involve themselves and inject themselves in law enforcement operations, they are risking arrest as well as jeopardizing the safety of themselves and those around them,\" McLaughlin said.\n\nVIDEOS SHOW ICE OFFICERS DRAWING WEAPONS\n\nWhile new internal ICE guidance, reported by Reuters in late January, instructed officers not to engage with protesters, the encounters have not stopped.\n\nTwo videos in recent weeks verified by Reuters showed ICE officers drawing their weapons as they approached vehicles that allegedly had been following them.\n\nSouth of Minneapolis on January 29, the same day Ringstrom was arrested, federal immigration officers abruptly swerved, stopped their vehicle and approached a woman driving behind them with guns drawn, according to dashcam footage ⁠from her vehicle first reported by Minnesota Public Radio and verified by Reuters.\n\nMcLaughlin said ICE officers were attempting to arrest a criminal offender when the woman began “stalking and obstructing” them, leading the officers to try to arrest ​her.\n\n“Law enforcement officers attempted to pull her over using their emergency lights to issue her a warning,” McLaughlin said. “Ignoring law enforcement commands, the agitator refused to pull over and began driving recklessly including running stop signs, nearly colliding with ​multiple vehicles, and driving directly at law enforcement in an attempt to ram their vehicle.”\n\nIn a separate incident on February 3, two ICE officers approached a car that had been following them, again, with guns drawn, according to video verified by Reuters and a DHS statement.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the vehicle had been “stalking” and “obstructing” ICE officers.\n\n“The agitators then followed the officers as they departed and made hand motions suggestive of possessing a firearm,” DHS said.\n\nUnder Trump, numerous DHS statements after violent encounters with immigration agents have been inaccurate ⁠or incomplete.\n\nSome Minnesota residents say they believe they are becoming the subject of an intimidation campaign.\n\nIn a suburb north of St. Paul on January 22, an ICE officer led a woman who was following his vehicle back to her house, making it clear that he knew her identity and address, Reuters-verified video filmed by the husband showed.\n\nThe woman’s husband spoke to the ICE officer outside of the couple’s house. When the husband questioned the tactic, the officer said, “You raise your voice, I erase your voice,” the video showed.\n\nOne ICE officer told Reuters they have led people following them back to their houses after running their license plates “to freak them out.”\n\nMcLaughlin said ICE would review body camera ⁠footage and investigate the incident in St. Paul, but did not comment on ICE using the tactic to frighten opponents.\n\nEarlier in January, two friends - Brandon Siguenza and Patty O’Keefe - who were following an ICE vehicle in Minneapolis said officers fired pepper spray into their car, smashed their car window and detained them for eight hours.\n\nMcLaughlin said officers gave them multiple warnings “to stop impeding” operations, but that they “chose to continue to stalk law enforcement and were arrested.”\n\n“The passenger refused to roll ‌down the window and exit the vehicle,” McLaughlin said. “ICE law enforcement followed their training and used the minimum amount of force necessary to make the arrest.”\n\nMcLaughlin did not explicitly confirm that officers broke the car window or deployed pepper spray.\n\nSiguenza and O’Keefe have not been charged.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorney General Pam Bondi will face questions from lawmakers Wednesday over the Justice Department's handling of files related to Jeffrey Epstein that have exposed sensitive private information about victims despite redaction efforts.\n\nBondi is confronting a new wave of criticism stemming from the political saga that has dogged her term after the release of millions of additional Epstein disclosures that victims have slammed as sloppy and incomplete.\n\nIt will be the first time the attorney general appears before Congress since a tumultuous hearing in October in which she repeatedly deflected questions and countered Democrats' criticism of her actions with her own political attacks.\n\nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee are expected to grill Bondi on how the Justice Department decided what should and should not be made public under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which was passed by Congress after the department abruptly announced in July that no more files would be released even though it had raised the hopes of conservative influencers and conspiracy theorists.\n\nBondi has continuously struggled to move past the backlash over her handling of the Epstein files since distributing binders to a group of social media influencers at the White House last February. The binders included no new revelations about Epstein, leading to even more calls from President Donald Trump’s base for the files to be released.\n\nThe hearing comes days after some lawmakers visited a Justice Department office to look through unredacted versions of the files. As part of an arrangement with the Justice Department, lawmakers were given access to the over 3 million released files in a reading room with four computers and were allowed to take handwritten notes.\n\nDemocrats have accused the Justice Department of redacting information that should have been made public, including information that could lead to scrutiny of Epstein’s associates. Meanwhile, victims have slammed the department for inconsistent or nonexistent redactions that allowed for the inadvertent release of nude photos and other private information about victims.\n\nThe department has defended the latest rollout of more than 3 million pages of documents along with more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images. The Associated Press and other media organizations are still reviewing millions of pages of documents, many of them previously confidential.\n\nAn AP review of records shows that while investigators collected ample proof that Epstein sexually abused underage girls, they found scant evidence the well-connected financier led a sex trafficking ring serving powerful men. Videos and photos seized from Epstein’s homes in New York, Florida and the Virgin Islands didn’t depict victims being abused or implicate anyone else in his crimes, a prosecutor wrote in one 2025 memo.",

    "fullText": "Speaker Mike Johnson failed to reinstate a ban on lawmakers’ ability to challenge President Donald Trump’s tariffs when three Republicans crossed party lines to vote with Democrats.\n\nThe House sank a procedural vote on Tuesday that contained language blocking votes in the chamber that object to Trump’s tariffs through July. The move opens the door for Democrats to move forward with forcing votes to repeal Trump’s tariffs, in a blow to the administration.\n\nWith razor-thin margins in the House, three Republicans – GOP Reps. Thomas Massie, Don Bacon and Kevin Kiley – were enough to sink the vote. Johnson can only afford to lose one Republican vote to advance legislation with his current margin.\n\nThe Senate has passed at least three resolutions rebuking Trump’s tariffs, but routinely ran into resistance in the House where members were blocked from forcing votes on the matter.\n\nBacon said in a statement posted to X, “I don’t like putting the important work of the House on pause, but Congress needs to be able to debate on tariffs.”\n\nThe Nebraska congressman went on to say, “tariffs have been a ‘net negative’ for the economy and are a significant tax that American consumers, manufacturers, and farmers are paying. Article I of the Constitution places authority over taxes and tariffs with Congress for a reason, but for too long, we have handed that authority to the executive branch. It’s time for Congress to reclaim that responsibility.”\n\nGOP leaders had argued that lawmakers should allow the Supreme Court time to weigh in.\n\nSpeaker Johnson acknowledged the challenges he faces holding together his razor-thin majority after the failed vote.\n\n“Look, this is life with a small majority. I mean, you know, I need unanimity every day, and we didn’t get it tonight,” he told reporters.\n\n“The vast majority of the House Republicans agree wholeheartedly with the president, and we’re going to give him the latitude to continue his trade policy,” he said.",

    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks won Super Bowl 60 and so did NBC — but not by as much as they would have liked.\n\nAn average of 124.9 million people tuned in, per NBC Sports. NBC generated the second-most-watched Super Bowl — behind 2025's game on FOX Sports — in its broadcast of the Big Game. It ended a two-year streak of record-breaking Super Bowl viewership.\n\nTelemundo, however, delivered a record with the most-watched Super Bowl in US Spanish-language history with an average of 3.3 million viewers. That viewership peaked during Bad Bunny's halftime show performance, with 4.9 million viewers.\n\nOverall, viewership was an average of 128.2 million from 8:15 to 8:30 p.m. ET during Bad Bunny's performance.\n\nAn all-time record 137.8 million viewers watched across NBC, Peacock, and Telemundo during the second quarter, according to NBC Sports.\n\nA more detailed breakdown will be available from Nielsen later this week, NBC Sports said in its press release.\n\nMany major sporting events — including last year's Super Bowl — have seen their ratings increase since Nielsen changed its ratings calculation in late January 2025 to better account for out-of-home viewing, such as people watching at restaurants and bars.\n\nThe college football National Championship Game drew in just over 30 million people, up about 36% from last year's mark of 22.1 million and close to the all-time record of 33.9 million in 2015.\n\nUnder Nielsen's prior ratings methodology, this year's college football championship would have generated just over 28 million viewers. That's based on an ESPN spokesperson telling The Athletic that the game's ratings would have risen 27% year over year under the old format. In other words, out-of-home viewing appeared to add 2 million viewers to the game's total.\n\nSo while Nielsen's revamped viewership calculations may have affected Sunday's ratings, it might not have made a massive difference.",

    "fullText": "Ben Ogden, 25, won silver in men's cross-country skiing at the Milan Cortina Games on Tuesday, and he's celebrating by unwinding with his favorite hobby — knitting.\n\n\"It's a great way to relax,\" Ogden told The Guardian on Tuesday. \"It won't be easy to come down and try to fall asleep tonight. After a day like today, my knitting needles are probably waiting for me.\"\n\nOgden's podium finish ended a five-decade Olympic medal drought for the US in men's cross-country skiing. The last medal came when fellow Vermonter Bill Koch won silver at the 1976 Innsbruck Games.\n\n\"It's an unbelievable dream come true,\" Ogden said. \"Everybody who races dreams of being on an Olympic podium. Last year I really dared to set my expectations on an Olympic medal. Every day in training I thought about how I could get better and be the best version of myself on this course.\"\n\nWhen the racing ends, Ogden turns to yarn and needles to decompress. At a press conference last week, Ogden said he even arranged for extra yarn to be shipped in during the Games so he wouldn't run out.\n\n\"I have gotten really into knitting recently. So far, I've knit a hat and a sweater this season. I'm really fired about it,\" he said, per Reuters. \"I brought all kinds of yarn. I actually ordered some, so hopefully it'll get here from Iceland.\"\n\nHe said his latest project is a pair of mittens featuring French historical figure Joan of Arc.\n\n\"For me, it's a pretty awesome way to just, like, relax. I really crave the ability to make things. That's something that I have when I'm home and I didn't have when I'm here until now,\" Ogden said.\n\nOgden isn't the only one on the US cross-country skiing team who enjoys knitting. His teammate, Jessie Diggins, also showed off a sweater she knitted on her Instagram in January.\n\nIt's not just a Winter Games pastime either — British diver Tom Daley went viral for knitting in the stands during the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n\"One thing that has kept me sane throughout this whole process is my love for knitting and crochet and all things stitching,\" Daley said in a 2021 Instagram post, adding that he picked up the hobby during the pandemic.",

    "description": "Dan Ives says Wall Street is underestimating software's role in the AI boom, calling the skepticism \"disconnected.\"",
    "fullText": "Wall Street may be getting the AI trade wrong, says Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst and longtime tech bull.\n\nIves said on CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" published Tuesday that the recent investor pessimism toward software companies is 'the most disconnected call that I've ever seen.\"\n\nWhile much of the AI excitement has centered on data centers, chips, and GPUs, Ives said software will be the \"heart and lungs of the AI revolution.\"\n\nThe infrastructure buildout is still in its early innings and could stretch over the next decade. But software is where the real use cases and monetization will emerge, he added.\n\nIves said it is wrong to assume that big software companies like Salesforce and ServiceNow are \"structurally broken\" or set to be replaced by AI-native tools.\n\nThese companies are deeply embedded in enterprise stacks, with hundreds of thousands of customers, Ives said, adding that their AI use cases could unlock incremental revenue over the next six to 18 months that investors are not yet pricing in.\n\nLarge, entrenched platforms should not be compared to smaller players that serve small and medium-sized businesses. \"You cannot paint all of them with the same brush,\" Ives said.\n\nIves also defended Microsoft's role in the AI revolution. While acknowledging near-term concerns around capital spending and Azure growth, Ives said the broader AI rollout cannot succeed without Microsoft's software and cloud ecosystem.\n\nIves' comments came after software stocks tumbled last week amid investor fears that AI could disrupt large swaths of the industry.\n\nNot all tech and finance leaders think AI will replace traditional software companies. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed that idea at a Cisco AI event last week.\n\n\"There's this notion that the tool industry is in decline and will be replaced by AI,\" Huang said. \"You could tell because there's a whole bunch of software companies whose stock prices are under a lot of pressure because somehow AI is going to replace them. It is the most illogical thing in the world and time will prove itself,\" he added.\n\nHuang said AI depends on the tools software offers and pointed to ServiceNow, SAP, Cadence, and Synopsis as examples of software firms well-positioned in the AI era.\n\nIves also wrote in an industry note published last week that the \"software armageddon\" can be regarded as a tech stock \"garage sale.\"\n\n\"We believe the market is baking in a doomsday scenario for software companies in the near-term, which we believe is extremely overblown, as many customers won't be willing to put their data at risk to capitalize on AI implementation strategies until there is less risk with these migration projects,\" Ives and his analysts wrote.\n\nIves has long urged investors to buy tech dips, even as critics caution that AI enthusiasm may be running ahead of earnings and real-world adoption.",

It's part of a broader shift in how governments and investors are treating commodities, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nCentral bank buying has helped drive gold's surge in recent years as governments seek to hedge geopolitical and financial risks. Now, similar \"insurance\"-style strategies are emerging across other commodity markets, analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note on Tuesday.\n\n\"As some of these risk-management policies have taken hold, some commodity markets appear to be transitioning — at least temporarily — from a single, global balance toward more regionally segmented systems, raising the risk of higher volatility,\" they wrote.\n\nThat shift stems from recent supply shocks.\n\nAfter 2020's supply-chain disruptions and 2022's food and energy shocks, policymakers focused on securing access to critical materials, Goldman's analysts wrote.\n\nThat has included tariffs, export controls, support for domestic production, and the buildup of government stockpiles.\n\nTogether, those measures are reshaping commodity markets in ways that can make prices more sensitive to shocks.\n\nGoldman pointed to copper as an early example. Despite expectations of a global oversupply in 2025, prices surged as US stockpiling pulled material out of international markets. That left markets outside the US, where global benchmark prices are largely set, tighter.\n\nThe dynamic isn't limited to governments.\n\n\"Recent client feedback suggests that insurance-type demand for several commodities — not only gold but also industrial metals such as copper — has broadened beyond the public sector, as private sector investors turn to hard assets for diversification in an uncertain global policy environment,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nThose investor flows are supporting metals prices and amplifying volatility.\n\nFor most commodities, supply can adjust when prices rise. Producers often ramp up output, helping cool price spikes driven by \"insurance\" demand.\n\nBut policies aimed at making supply more secure can also encourage overproduction. That can push prices lower, drive out smaller producers, and leave supply more concentrated, increasing the risk of future disruptions and sharp price swings.\n\nGold, however, remains structurally different.\n\nNearly all the gold ever mined still exists above ground, and annual supply is relatively stable and slow to respond to price moves, the Goldman analysts wrote. That means demand driven by risk concerns can keep pushing gold prices higher for longer.\n\nSpot gold was trading around $5,500 per troy ounce early Wednesday. Prices are up about 16% this year amid volatile trading.\n\nGold hit a record high above $5,500 per ounce on January 29 before plunging a day later, with the yellow metal falling more than 10% to below $5,000 per ounce.",

    "title": "Power banks, body warmers, and antifreeze: Ukrainian troops tell us how they survive deep winter out in the trenches",
    "description": "For Ukrainian infantry and drone teams, the extreme cold brings new challenges to modern war in the trenches.",
    "fullText": "For Ukrainian infantry, surviving the dead of winter requires a delicate balance.\n\n\"It's really, really cold in Ukraine,\" said Nefor, the chief sergeant of an infantry company in Ukraine's 3rd Army Corps. \"I think, the first winter in some time with such cold weather.\"\n\nA cold snap whipped through much of Ukraine last week, delivering frigid temperatures that sank to -6°F on some nights in the northeastern region of Kharkiv, where Nefor's corps is fighting.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to him and another Ukrainian commander, who oversees a drone company on the front lines, to discuss what it takes to hold a trench position in such weather. Trench warfare, largely glossed over in the last few decades, has seen a resurgence in interest from militaries around the world, especially those in Europe, watching Russia's plodding invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNefor, who spoke on the condition that he only be identified by his callsign, is in charge of assigning infantry rotations to their frontline positions.\n\nWhile holding a position, a key item each soldier needs is chemical body warmers, which can be slipped under their uniforms, said Nefor.\n\n\"You put this warmer against your body, and your blood circulating is warm. It works, not bad,\" Nefor said. \"If you want to rest a little bit, you take a chemical warmer, a sleeping bag, and it's faster.\"\n\nAt such temperatures, frostbite can easily set in within 30 minutes, so troops constantly need the warmers, he said. One typically lasts six to eight hours, meaning a soldier needs at least three warmers per day, Nefor added.\n\nHis company experimented with electrically powered warmers. But they come with a risk — anyone who gets too warm would be more easily spotted by thermal optics, especially since their surroundings are much colder than usual.\n\nChemical warmers, conversely, emit such small heat signatures that light drones won't be able to spot them, Nefor said.\n\n\"It's possible to see if the Russian guy has a 'teplevizor' on his weapon, but it's a very small signature,\" the sergeant said, referring to thermal imagery attachments for small arms.\n\nSerhii Andrieiev, a senior lieutenant who is second-in-command of the \"Kraken\" drone company in the 3rd Army Corps, said his pilots prioritize camouflage for their nests during the winter. In the colder seasons, there is less forest foliage to provide visual cover.\n\nThe heat signature from the motors on their drones is easier to spot, and only \"very happy drone operators\" have the luxury of stationing in a building along the Kharkiv frontline, Andrieiev said.\n\n\"In most cases, it's a big foxhole, or a cellar in a destroyed building,\" the deputy commander said.\n\nAppliances such as electric warmers also soak up significant energy and require a power source in the trenches.\n\nNefor said his company deploys roughly 20 EcoFlow portable batteries, but there aren't enough to cover all its frontline positions. The batteries are also needed to power screens and radios, he added.\n\nAlmost all soldiers instead carry personal power banks to keep their devices charged. \"It's the power bank you buy at the shop,\" Nefor said. \"Power banks with Type-C or USB ports.\"\n\nCold temperatures can grow even more dangerous when they alternate between above and below freezing. Clothes, especially in humid areas, can absorb thawed water that can then freeze again, increasing the risk of hypothermia.\n\n\"If you are not dry, you die,\" Nefor said. \"We have this saying.\"\n\nClothing that gets wet in the winter stays wet, so troops who need dry layers have to request new ones from their commanders.\n\nUncrewed ground vehicles have recently been a major boon for Nefor's company in this regard, freeing up human soldiers by carrying weeks' worth of ammunition, clothing, and other supplies such as food, water, and chemical warmers to the trenches.\n\nFirearms and ammunition can become waterlogged as well. Nefor said that his troops, worried that their weapons would freeze up, apply a lubricating concoction to their rifles that mostly includes vehicle oil and sometimes a small amount of antifreeze.\n\n\"You need to make one, two shots with your weapon to make it warmer, then you add it,\" Nefor said.\n\nBoth commanders said the deep winter adds to the mental toll on Ukraine's already-beset troops, who are often short on reinforcements and the grinding nature of the war.\n\nNefor's company sends smaller groups of two or three soldiers — no more than four — to each position to avoid detection from Russian drones. Each soldier takes turns for several hours in the trenches between watch positions, which are typically colder, and warmer resting locations.\n\nAndrieiev said that if he had more drone pilots, he could rotate them out of the front lines every four or five days. His teams instead spend two to three weeks at a time in the forests.\n\n\"It's exhausting to spend all that time in freezing temperatures. Even if you have heaters with you,\" Andrieiev said.\n\nTroops need more fuel and more clothes to perform their duties, he said. A task as simple as using an improvised bathroom in the trenches is stressful, with the soldier under threat from Russian drones while wearing multiple layers, body armor, and carrying their military gear.\n\nThe Russian assaults they have to fight off, meanwhile, stay just as frequent and intense during cold weeks, Andrieiev said.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what the weather is. They come at us like zombies, two or three guys at a time in the middle of the frozen field,\" he said.",

    "description": "Officials said they've learned of multiple instances where Russian troops have tried to threaten or pay Ukrainians to register such terminals.",
    "fullText": "Kyiv officials warned that Ukrainians might be coerced into registering Starlink terminals for the Kremlin's forces after a recent block on Russia's access to the service.\n\nUkraine's auxiliary body for handling prisoners of war posted a notice on Tuesday saying that it had learned of multiple instances where families of Ukrainian prisoners were threatened and told to enroll such terminals.\n\nThe warning comes after Ukraine's defense ministry reached a deal with SpaceX earlier this month to cut off Russia's access to Starlink by blocking general connectivity across Ukrainian territory.\n\n\"Looking for a way out of the difficult situation in which they found themselves, the occupiers turned their attention to the families of the prisoners,\" the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War wrote in a statement.\n\n\"Cases of threats and demands to officially register Starlink terminals have been recorded,\" it added.\n\nTo maintain Starlink access, Ukrainian troops, civilians, and businesses must register individual terminals to a \"whitelist,\" either online or at municipal centers.\n\nThe sweeping move aimed to curb a black-market loophole that Russian forces were exploiting. In compliance with US sanctions, SpaceX doesn't do business with Russia, but Ukraine has repeatedly said that Russian troops were obtaining terminals and using them to guide attack and reconnaissance drones.\n\nIn its latest statement, the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said that officials could trace the registration of terminals that were later used by Russian forces because enrollment requires an ID.\n\n\"If the terminal is used to control drones that destroy infrastructure and take lives, the fact of registering the terminal by a citizen of Ukraine is grounds for criminal prosecution,\" the agency added.\n\nRussia is not known to have a satellite internet service that compares to Starlink's in terms of speed, availability, and stability.\n\n\"For the enemy, Starlink is so important that they have deployed a whole network to search for traitors who are ready to register Starlink for themselves in the Central Administrative Service,\" wrote Serhii \"Flash\" Beskrestnov, a drone analyst and an advisor to Ukraine's defense ministry, in a Telegram statement on Sunday.\n\nIn some cases, Russian troops were offering up to $230 to register a single terminal, Beskrestnov added. That's roughly a third of the median monthly salary in Ukraine.\n\nFor the Kremlin's forces, the service disruption has been significant enough that pro-Russian military bloggers have reported that most Russian units now lack internet access. Some have blamed Moscow for what they called a reliance on Western technology, even as the US and Europe explicitly back Ukraine.\n\n\"It's about to suddenly become clear that units cannot operate effectively without communications. That'll be news to some in high places,\" one blogger, under the handle Belarusian Silovik, wrote.\n\nDenying Russian access to Starlink had long been a priority for Ukraine's new defense minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, who had previously advocated such measures while serving as minister for digital transformation.",

    "fullText": "The Sonder fiasco cost Marriott millions.\n\nOn a Tuesday earnings call, Marriott's outgoing finance chief, Leeny Oberg, said Marriott incurred a $23 million loss from terminating its contract with the luxury short-term rental company Sonder in November.\n\nA Tuesday earnings report said the $23 million in charges came from termination expenses and the write-down of Marriott's licensing agreement with Sonder. Oberg added that it was a one-time expense.\n\nThere were no other mentions in the earnings call of any fallout Marriott experienced because of the termination.\n\nIn November, Marriott made headlines for giving its guests staying at Sonder properties short notice to vacate. Affected guests that Business Insider spoke to said they scrambled to find alternative accommodations at exorbitant costs, and had their vacations ruined by the experience.\n\nGuests also described Marriott flip-flopping on its refund policy. The hotel chain initially assured guests who had booked Sonder properties through Marriott's channels that they would get a full refund. A few days later, the guests were instructed to approach their credit card companies for refunds.\n\nSonder workers described the chaos and confusion of the messy breakup to Business Insider, saying they found out from the news that they would be losing their jobs.\n\nShortly afterward, Sonder, a onetime Airbnb rival founded in 2014, filed for Chapter 7 liquidation proceedings in a Delaware federal bankruptcy court. Its stock price crashed.\n\nDespite the hit from Sonder's termination, Marriott reported strong financial results in the latest quarter.\n\nIt reported its latest quarter revenue of $6.69 billion, a 4% increase compared to the same period the year before. Its revenue per available room increased 1.9% year on year. It had about 610,000 available rooms as of the end of December, per the Tuesday earnings report.\n\nThe company's stock increased about 8.5% after earnings were announced on Tuesday. It's up 18% in the past year.\n\nRepresentatives for Marriott did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Robin Cousins says Britons Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson need to be \"flawless\" to win an Olympic medal on Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "As we debriefed Monday's action, I asked former Olympic figure skating champion Robin Cousins what Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson need to do to win an ice dance medal at the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nAfter a brief pause, he gave a concise answer: \"They have to be flawless.\"\n\nFear and Gibson - aiming to be the first Britons since Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean in 1994 to win an Olympic figure skating medal - are in fourth place after the rhythm dance.\n\nIn the first half of the ice dance competition at Milan-Cortina, they performed to their popular Spice Girls mix - but could not match the season-best score they secured in the team event three days earlier.\n\nFear, 26, lost her balance slightly at one point, but she and her partner recovered well to keep themselves firmly in the hunt for a podium finish.\n\nTheir score of 84.57 points left them 0.71 behind third-placed Canadian duo Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier going into Wednesday's free dance, when the medals will be decided.\n\nGold and silver are probably out of reach. France's Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron lead with a huge 90.18. World champions and pre-event favourites Madison Chock and Evan Bates, who have already won gold in the team event for the US, are in second on 89.72.\n\nBut bronze remains within grasp for Fear and Gibson.\n\nThe 'Disco Brits' are the darlings of British figure skating - as was evident at last month's European Championships in Sheffield.\n\nYou could have your photo taken on the arena concourse with a pleasure-beach style cut-out - your face on the bodies of Fear and Gibson.\n\nTheir Spice Girls-themed routine drew applause from the band's official account on Instagram.\n\nThere were even misty-eyed stories of how the last time the European Figure Skating Championships were held in Sheffield in 2012, Fear was a flower girl.\n\nBut amid all the glitz and hype, the hard truth is that while they are definitely good enough for a medal, this is such a competitive field that any error is costly.\n\nFear and Gibson won bronze in Sheffield, but it could - maybe should - have been more. In just the second element of nine in their free routine, Gibson slipped slightly into the synchronised twizzles, and gold was gone.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nFear and Gibson are used to overcoming the odds.\n\nIn a discipline in which many partnerships are competing together by their mid-teens, theirs is an unusual story.\n\nFear and 31-year-old Gibson first trained together in Montreal in 2016. Fear was a junior ice dancer but Gibson new to the discipline. He had only taken up skating aged 11, before switching to ice dance at 21.\n\nBut in their first season together, they won the British title - and Cousins thinks their differences from the norm are their greatest strengths.\n\n\"They don't have a history, meaning unlike some of the couples they are competing with they came together late in their careers,\" Cousins, who won men's figure skating gold in 1980, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"That gave it an edge. There was no time to play catch-up and it worked - they found a niche in the way they perform compared to everyone else. People love them and how they perform.\n\n\"To have it so clean and proficient takes time, and it is time they have not had. They are trying to mould themselves and hone the bladework which others have had a lot more time doing.\n\n\"But the possibility is fantastic for them. If I were to speak to them, it would be to say that what other people think of you is none of your business.\"\n\nFear and Gibson's uniqueness is present in their routines.\n\nAs well as the Spice Girls compilation, their free programme is a tribute to Gibson's Scottish roots with a mix of The Bonnie Banks of Loch Lomond, Auld Lang Syne, and The Proclaimers hit I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles). They worked with highland dance experts to perfect the choreography.\n\n\"They're the hits!\" Fear said of their musical tastes. \"We started the season with a slower middle, but we changed it to an upbeat piece - they are crowd favourites.\"\n\nThey are also not afraid to go against the figure skating mould off the ice.\n\nGibson, who is gay, said at the Europeans that he would like to see same-sex partnerships allowed on the international stage in his event - adding his voice to a growing movement in favour of the change.\n\nOn the ice, they still have momentum. Since finishing 10th at Beijing 2022, Fear and Gibson have won the first World Championship medal for Great Britain in more than 40 years, were ranked first by the ISU after the 2024-25 season and have won continental medals at every opportunity.\n\nSo, to Wednesday, and the hope they will bring their very best at the moment they have trained for all this time.\n\n\"There is an amazing confidence,\" said Cousins. \"It is not arrogance, it is confidence, they carry that on to the ice when others don't.\n\n\"The visibility is great, but to know how hard they have worked in the last few years - all we hope is that they step off the ice in Milan happy. What the judges decide to do is up to them.\n\n\"There is a chance [of a medal] - they must do their best and hope for the best.\"\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "Chelsea 2-2 Leeds: Palmer missed an open goal in the 94th minute as Rosenior fell to his first real upset as Blues boss",
    "fullText": "Cole Palmer’s face said it all. His mouth agasp in utter disbelief, the 94th-minute open-goal miss of the weekend’s hat-trick hero perhaps signalled the end of Liam Rosenior’s honeymoon period. And once more, it’s against Leeds United when fortunes change for a Chelsea manager.\n\nBefore the visit of Daniel Farke’s men, Rosenior’s early career at the Stamford Bridge helm consisted of seven wins in nine games, only suffering defeat in Chelsea’s two Carabao Cup semi-final legs against quadruple-chasing Arsenal. His impressive record had admittedly been aided by a favourable run of league fixtures, with his only top-half opponents coming in the form of Brentford in mid-January. But considering the backlash from a portion of the fanbase following his appointment, alarm bells were yet to really sound on BlueCo’s pick.\n\nDropped points against Leeds, however, could be the reality check that shifts the tide, as was the case in December. The visitors’ dismantling of Chelsea in this season’s reverse fixture plunged a club with a growing ambition of a title charge into turmoil. Defeat at Elland Road, eight days on from a stunning 3-0 win over Barcelona, can be seen as the turning point that led to Enzo Maresca’s messy demise. A month and two wins in seven games later, the Italian was sacked.\n\nChelsea were overrun in that contest, falling victim to a blistering start by Daniel Farke’s side as they fell behind inside six minutes. There was a brief sense the same was about to happen when Jayden Bogle, bizarrely playing in a second striker role rather than his usual wing-back position, found himself in the Blues box inside 60 seconds, a break stemming from Cole Palmer giving the ball away cheaply. Without Dominic Calvert-Lewin in support, who lost his race to make fitness, Bogle ended up running the ball out of play, but it was an early glimmer of hope for the visitors.\n\nThat glimmer was swiftly snuffed out as Chelsea grew increasingly comfortable. Leeds became camped in their own half as the hosts pressed and probed, who found the breakthrough in the 24th minute thanks to a scything Chelsea move, cutely finished by Joao Pedro after being slipped in by Palmer.\n\nThat’s eight goal contributions in his last nine outings for the Brazilian, who had seen his star fade after an electric start to his Chelsea career. The instant impact he made in New Jersey last summer, lighting up the latter stages of the Club World Cup before carrying that form into the opening weeks of the season, led many to tip him as the Premier League’s signing of the season. He is now rediscovering the potency that justified that initial hype.\n\nThe roles of Chelsea goalscorer and provider were swapped after the break, in a way. Jaka Bijol gifted the Blues a penalty in the 56th minute, pushing Joao Pedro in the back with both hands to send the striker tumbling over. The Slovene’s appeals were pointless - it was stonewall. And off the back of his first-half hat-trick at Molineux - including two converted spot-kicks - there was no mistake from Palmer, tucking past Karl Darlow to double his side’s lead.\n\nChelsea were cruising, with Rosenior looking on course for an fourth straight league win. The new Blues boss has so far looked impermeable to an upset - but then the wheels came off.\n\nJust as it seemed a clumsy challenge down one end had put the game out of sight for Leeds, a clumsy challenge down the other end offered the visitors a way back. Moises Caicedo’s tripping of Bogle gave referee John Brooks another simple decision to make, and Lukas Nmecha - deputising for Calvert-Lewin - sent Robert Sanchez the wrong way.\n\nSix minutes later, things weren’t so black and white for the referee. Noah Okafor tucked into an open net after a calamitous mix-up between Sanchez and Josh Acheampong, who failed to clear the ball after Bogle had forced himself into the box. It seemed, however, that Chelsea’s sinners would get a reprieve, with replays showing the ball to have touched Bogle’s arm in the build-up.\n\nA delay ensued - not as long as we’ve seen in the recent past, but one significant enough for home fans to believe a jog to the monitor was imminent. But that didn’t come; the goal was given. Leeds were resurrected, Chelsea crestfallen.\n\nFarke’s side still had a quarter of an hour to survive as Chelsea upped the ante, but while taking no credit away from their defensive reslience, there was a sense it just wouldn’t fall for the hosts now that they’d surrendering total control.\n\nJoao Pedro was nearly the hero as his late header crashed off the bar, but it’s Palmer who will have sleepless nights after skying a last-gasp chance with the goal gaping from a couple of yards out. Caicedo, who must have thought he’d set up a late winner when squaring it across the six-yard box, could not quite believe his talisman hadn’t scored as he looked lifelessly into the Matthew Harding Stand.\n\nPalmer was crouched, dejected, before the full-time whistle even went, with Leeds winding down the final seconds of the clock. For Farke’s side, it’s another point towards survival.\n\nChampions League qualification remains paramount for the Blues and this result on its own will not harm them too much, with sixth-placed Liverpool going into the matchweek four points adrift. But as we saw at the tail-end of 2025, things can snowball and fast. Just ask Rosenior’s predecessor.",

    "fullText": "Meet Browns new Special Teams Coordinator Byron Storer: 3 things to know originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Cleveland Browns have hired a coordinator…no not on defense to replace Jim Schwartz, but on special teams.\n\nNew head coach Todd Monken is adding Byron Storer to lead the unit in place of the embattled Bubba Ventrone.\n\nLet’s be honest, Cleveland’s third phase was a nightmare in 2025. According to official 2025 team statistics, the Browns ranked dead last (32nd) in punt return yards allowed and 31st in yards per kick return. To put it bluntly, the \"un\"special teams were a liability that cost the team games.\n\nComing over from Green Bay as the assistant special teams coach, can Storer turn the tide? Here are the three most important things to know about the man tasked with fixing the mess.\n\nMore: Browns DC search: Albert Breer names new 'leader' to replace Jim Schwartz\n\n1. He is a \"Special Teams Royalty\" Disciple\n\nStorer is the hand-picked protege of Rich Bisaccia, arguably the greatest special teams mind in the modern NFL. Storer has been Bisaccia’s \"right-hand man\" for nearly a decade, following him from the Buccaneers, to the Raiders, to the Packers. He’s helped modernize Bisaccia’s legendary playbook, meaning the Browns are getting a cutting-edge system with a proven pedigree.\n\nIf you want explosive returns, Storer is your guy. During his time in Green Bay (2022–2025), he was instrumental in coaching Keisean Nixon to back-to-back First-Team All-Pro honors. He also helped tutor Raiders punter AJ Cole and kicker Daniel Carlson into All-Pro status. Storer’s record of elevating individual talent to the highest level is just what this Browns squad needs.\n\n3. He’s a Former Player with a \"Grinder\" Mentality\n\nStorer isn't just a clipboard carrier; he played three seasons as a fullback and special teams \"ace\" for the Buccaneers. His career ended early due to injury. He brings a \"players-first\" energy to the locker room that should resonate with a Browns roster looking for a fresh start.\n\nReplacing David Njoku: Top 3 Browns TE free agent targets\n\nBrowns 32nd?! 3 reasons ESPN's 2026 power rankings are way off for Cleveland\n\nBrowns draft shock: The Athletic’s 3-round mock includes a wild QB move\n\nMyles Garrett sends reality check to Shedeur Sanders: 'He's got to earn it'\n\nBust to boom: Do the Browns already have the ‘next Sam Darnold’ on the roster?",

    "description": "Maxim Naumov's score Tuesday was enough to make it through the short program, giving him another opportunity to perform when the men's free skate takes place Friday night.",
    "fullText": "U.S. figure skater Maxim Naumov carried the memory of his late parents with him to the Olympics on Tuesday night, delivering an emotional, heartfelt short program at the Milan Cortina Games that fulfilled a dream they had long shared together.\n\nHis parents, former pairs world champions Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, were among the 67 people killed — more than two dozen of them members of the figure skating community — when American Airlines Flight 5342 crashed into a military helicopter on approach to Ronald Reagan National Airport and fell into the icy Potomac River on Jan. 29, 2025.\n\nOne of the last conversations Naumov had with his parents was about what it would take to make the Olympics.\n\n\"I've been inspired by them since day 1, ever since we stepped on the ice together,\" said Naumov, who brought an old photograph of that moment to the kiss-and-cry at the Milano Ice Skating Arena, the little tyke standing between his parents as he stepped foot on the ice for the first time, the three of them all smiling for the camera.\n\n\"It's not necessarily thinking about them specifically,\" Naumov said, \"but their presence. Feeling their presence. With every glide and step that I made on the ice, I couldn't help but feel their support, almost like a chess piece on a chess board.\"\n\nWhat made one of the feel-good stories of the Winter Games even more special was the performance.\n\nWhile a long shot to make the top 10 at the Olympics, much less land on the podium, the 24-year-old Naumov nevertheless had one of the best short programs of his career. He opened with a quad salchow as his godmother, Gretta Bogdan, watched from the stands, and he followed up with a triple axel and a triple lutz-triple toe loop to finish out the program.\n\nAs the last notes of \"Nocturne No. 20\" by Frederic Chopin reverberated through the arena, and the crowd rose to its feet, Naumov slid to a stop on his knees and looked to the sky, telling his parents: \"Look at what we've done.\"\n\n\"I didn't know if I was going to cry, smile or laugh,\" he said afterward, \"and all I could do was look up at them. And man, I still can't believe what just happened. I think it's going to take me a few hours or maybe a few weeks to know.\"\n\nHis score of 85.65 was enough to make it through the short program, giving him another opportunity to perform when the men's free skate takes place Friday night.\n\nThe plane carrying Naumov's parents also had aboard 11 young skaters, two other coaches and several family members who had been attending a development camp in Wichita, Kansas, following the 2025 national championships.\n\nNaumov's parents were coaches at the Skating Club of Boston, which lost six members in the midair crash.\n\nNaumov had flown out earlier, shortly after he had finished in fourth place for the third consecutive year.\n\n\"I can't describe how difficult it was at the very beginning, and through month after month of really just trying my hardest to keep a positive mindset, and focus on day to day, thankfully, skating became a tool that actually helped me overcome that,\" Naumov told CBS News Boston last month during his Olympic training at the Skating Club.\n\nThe idea of fulfilling the Olympic dream he harbored with his parents pushed him on. And when he finished third at the U.S. championships in January, his spot was all-but secured.\n\n\"To be honest,\" Naumov said Tuesday night, \"I wasn't thinking about executing anything perfectly or anything like that.

    "fullText": "Bills sign former QB back to return to Buffalo originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills have brought back an old quarterback friend.\n\nShane Buechele is going to spend another offseason with the Bills.\n\nAccording to The Athletic's Joe Buscaglia, the Bills have signed Buechele back to their roster. It's a reserve/futures contract that allows Buechele to spend the offseason program with Buffalo.\n\nBuechele spent most of this season on the Bills' practice squad.\n\nBut after the Kansas City Chiefs lost Patrick Mahomes and Gardner Minshew to injury, they signed Buechele to their active roster to be the backup to Chris Oladokun.\n\nIn Week 18, Buechele came on in relief of Oladokun. It was his regular season NFL debut. He completed 7-of-14 passes.\n\nMORE: The latest on Travis Kelce's retirement timeline\n\nThe Chiefs cut Buechele after their season ended, though, which was likely always the plan. They just needed him for the late-season insurance after already being eliminated from the playoffs.\n\nBuechele did then return to the Bills' practice squad in the playoffs. But a practice squad player becomes a free agent as soon as the season ends.\n\nThat did give Buechele a chance, if he wanted, to sign elsewhere.\n\nBut he knows the QB room in Buffalo, with offensive coordinator Joe Brady now promoted to head coach, and he's got a good relationship with Josh Allen.\n\nThat makes it very logical to keep Buechele around. No reason to mess with the vibes in the depths of the quarterbacks on the roster.\n\nBuechele likely will never start a regular season game of consequence for the Bills, but he's not bad to have around.\n\nDerek Carr shocks NFL world with retirement comeback news\n\nThe Steelers' first ever draft pick was named William Shakespeare\n\nThe Patriots might have a Will Campbell problem\n\nDay off after the Super Bowl is coming sooner than you think\n\nDrake Maye was 'seeing ghosts' in the Super Bowl\n\nJahvid Best has traveled a cool journey since the NFL",

    "fullText": "The United States have a lot of star power at the Olympic Winter Games in Milan. They include Mikaela Shiffrin, Jordan Stolz, Lindsey Vonn, Chloe Kim, and Ilya Malinin. However, on Tuesday, it was the American supporting cast that came away with Olympic hardware, and in the process made names for themselves that will bring them temporary fame.\n\nJacqueline Wiles and Paula Moltzan\n\nHeading into the slalom portion of the women’s team alpine combined, Breezy Johnson and Mikaela Shiffrin were the heavy favourites, as they were the defending world champions and even had the lead as Johnson was the fastest women’s downhill skier of the event. However, it was Shiffrin who had a poor slalom run, and the Johnson/Shiffrin tandem shockingly finished in fourth place. The Americans still got on to the podium in the event as Jacqueline Wiles of Portland, Oregon and Paula Moltzan of Lakeville, Minnesota posted a third place time of 2:21.91 to beat Shiffrin and Johnson by six one-hundredths of a second.\n\nWhat we saw on Tuesday was a gigantic upset from American cross country skier Ben Ogden of Lebanon, New Hampshire. The odds of Ogden coming through with a medal was +6500 according to 3wiresports.com. However, it was Ogden that had the second fastest time in the men’s sprint, and was only behind the heavy favourite, Johannes Hesflot Klaebo of Norway. For Klaebo, it was his second Olympic gold in Milan, as he also was first in Saturday’s skiathlon.\n\nThe mixed doubles curling event came to completion on Tuesday, with the United States winning silver behind only Sweden. It ws a notable week for American curler Cory Thiesse of Duluth, Minnesota. Thiesse became the very first American female curler to win an Olympic medal. The only other American medal in Olympic curling came in 2018, when John Shuster of Duluth shocked the curling world with a win over Sweden in the gold medal final in the men’s event.\n\nThe native of Fairbanks, Alaska is now a two-time Olympic medalist in slopestyle. After winning gold four years ago in Beijing, Alex Hall won silver on Tuesday at the Livigno Snow Park. Hall had a score of 85.75 points, and was beaten by the slimmest of margins–0.53 points. The gold medalist was Norway’s Birk Ruud, the Olympic gold medalist from men’a big air skiing in Beijing.\n\nIt has been a tough time for the Sacramento Kings over the last month, as the Kings are losers of 13 straight games. However, Olympic bronze medalist Ashley Farquharson calls Sacramento home and was marvelous on Tuesday as she claimed an unexpected bronze in the women’s luge event. Faquharson had a four run time of 3:31.582.\n\nThe post 2026 Winter Olympic Games: five medal Tuesday for Team USA appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "A season like no other for Bucheon ended in glory at Castle Park. For the first time ever, Bucheon FC 1995 are a K League 1 club, and given the upcoming changes to Korean domestic football at the end of 2026, this is arguably the best season ever to go up.\n\n*Defeated Suwon FC 4-2 on aggregate in the playoffs.\n\nBucheon FC are no strangers to playoff football in K League 2, having suffered more heartbreak than any other club. That is no longer the case. Two swashbuckling performances against Suwon FC saw them win the promotion decider and finally advance to K League 1. Don’t be fooled by the 4–2 aggregate scoreline — this was more comprehensive than that. What makes it even more astonishing is that Bucheon finished 8th in 2024.\n\nThe campaign began well before stuttering, as happens, in the middle third. Despite a couple of rollercoaster spells, it ended with a remarkably consistent finish. As their main rivals for third dropped points late on, Bucheon suffered just one defeat in ten. When I visited the club during this run, their confidence was striking. With two months still to play, they were already calling their destiny.\n\nIt helped having one of the league’s best foreign players in Rodrigo Bassani (14 goals, six assists), alongside the most destructive young midfielder in Park Hyun-bin. Park formed a formidable partnership with Japanese midfielder Takahashi Kazuki, creating an almost indestructible shield in front of the three-man defence. At the same time, Bucheon were also slaying K League 1 opposition en route to the Korea Cup semi-finals.\n\nWas Lee Young-min robbed of the Manager of the Year award?\n\nIncredibly, Lee Young-min did not win the K League 2 Manager of the Year award, which instead went to Incheon’s Yoon Jung-hwan. Yoon won the title with a K League 1-calibre squad containing several internationals. Lee, by contrast, improved Bucheon’s points total by 18, climbed five places, secured promotion, and reached the last four of the cup. It was nothing short of sensational.\n\nPark’s departure from Bucheon to Suwon is a hammer blow for the club. Still only 22, Park looks like a future captain and national team defensive midfielder in waiting. After joining from Incheon United, he became a mainstay in Bucheon’s midfield, amassing 62 appearances, mostly starts. His disciplinary record shows a player who loves to get stuck in. Park was a destructive force in front of the central defence, thwarting attacks and tidying up. A huge loss.\n\nYoon Bit-garam at pre-season training.\n\nFormer Korean international midfielder Yoon signed on a free transfer from Suwon FC over the winter break. It is unlikely Yoon will be a direct replacement for Park, but a player of his quality, experience, and popularity will always be valuable. Yoon made his league debut back in 2010 for Gyeongnam FC and has since enjoyed spells at Jeju SK, Ulsan, Seongnam, and Suwon FC, as well as a sojourn in China.\n\nWith much of the focus on Bassani, John Montaño flew under the radar for Bucheon in 2025. Twelve goals is a decent return for the Colombian, and he will lead the line in the first division. However, depth is important, and that’s where Vitor Gabriel fits in. The Brazilian joins from Gangwon FC, where his four goals in 27 appearances didn’t exactly strike fear into opponents. He will be a valuable asset off the bench as K League crams in a lot of football ahead of the World Cup. Vitor Gabriel will always be a legend at Gangwon for keeping them up in 2023.\n\nPatrick spent last season in J1 with Kyoto Sanga and arrives in Bucheon on a free transfer. In total, the Brazilian (he’ll feel right at home in K League 2) represented Kyoto 17 times, but only six were starts, and none since May. In fact, his last outing was back in July. Like Vitor, Patrick will be a squad player — but that’s exactly what Bucheon need now. The step up in class will be enormous.\n\nBassani has prior K League 1 experience after an unhappy spell at Suwon Bluewings. That 2023 season ended in relegation, but he briefly gave Suwon hope by scoring the winner away to FC Seoul in the penultimate round. It ultimately proved futile, and Bassani departed soon after for Bucheon. He now returns to the top flight a very different player.\n\nAt 28, Bassani is in the prime of his career. He captained Bucheon throughout the season, underlining his leadership and importance. The club’s focal point, he thrives on responsibility. While his left foot remains the best in the league — making him deadly from set pieces — he has also evolved into a consistent goal threat from open play. His playoff performance against Suwon FC, particularly in the second leg, was a masterclass that should be compulsory viewing for young players nationwide.\n\nWill Kim Kyu-min get to shine in K League 1?\n\nLocal lad Kim Kyu-min takes over from Park Hyun-bin as the young player to watch. The 22-year-old winger saw plenty of action last season, playing 30 times and scoring his only goal in a vital 1–0 away win over Ansan Greeners. If you want to know how highly the club rate him, consider that he started matches on the left wing against both Incheon United and Suwon Bluewings last term. The right-footed winger usually plays on the left flank, using his pace to beat defenders before cutting inside onto his favoured right foot.\n\nThis is arguably the best season ever to be promoted to K League 1. Structural changes at the end of the campaign — most notably the expansion from 12 to 14 teams — mean Bucheon cannot be automatically relegated. Only Gimcheon Sangmu are guaranteed to go down, regardless of their finish, due to the expiry of their agreement with Gimcheon City. Even a 12th-place finish would still offer Bucheon a playoff lifeline.\n\nAs a result, some pressure is eased. That said, the club will want to make an immediate impression and secure survival early, much like Anyang did in 2025. Another small-budget, city-owned club enjoying top-flight football for the first time, Anyang relied on smart recruitment and an experienced squad. For Bucheon, the priority is clear: turn Bucheon Stadium into a fortress. Two temporary pitchside stands have already been installed, and full houses should follow.\n\nMaximising points at home and grinding out draws against fellow strugglers will go a long way toward survival. But Bucheon should also allow themselves to dream. Anyang beat defending champions Ulsan HD away on opening day, took four points from FC Seoul, and thrashed Gimcheon Sangmu in October. If Bucheon can replicate even part of that, they will more than justify their place.\n\nFor consecutive seasons, K League 1 welcomes a brand-new club. Yet Bucheon’s history adds extra spice. Yukong Elephants, later Bucheon SK, once played in the top flight before abruptly relocating to Jeju in early 2006. Bucheon fans understandably still resent Jeju, in a saga eerily reminiscent of the Anyang–FC Seoul split.\n\nMeetings between the two promise intensity. Despite their size, Jeju have only been relegated once, while competitive fixtures between the clubs have been rare. Bucheon did eliminate Jeju from the 2025 Korea Cup, however, and the rematch arrives on Saturday, September 12. With both sides likely near the bottom, bragging rights — and vital points in the relegation fight — will be firmly on the line.",

    "description": "A recent report confirms what has been reported for weeks. The Bears will not receive comp picks for Ian Cunningham leaving to be Atlanta’s GM.",
    "fullText": "According to Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk, who emailed the NFL for confirmation, the Chicago Bears will not receive compensatory draft picks for losing assistant general manager Ian Cunningham to the Atlanta Falcons, where he will serve as their general manager.\n\n“The policy for receiving picks pertains to the head coach or the primary football executive,” the NFL told PFT on Tuesday via email. “The primary football executive position was filled by Matt Ryan.”\n\nThis was the expectation all along, since Matt Ryan was hired to be the Falcons’ president of football, a position Cunningham also interviewed for. Had Cunningham been hired for that job, which is Atlanta’s primary football executive, then the Bears would have been awarded two third-round draft picks by virtue of the Rooney Rule.\n\nWhat brought this subject up again was Ryan’s recent declaration that Cunningham will take the lead on roster decisions.\n\nAfter being asked if he would be actively involved in the draft and free agency, Ryan said, “Ian is in charge of that space.” Ryan went on to say that he’s looking forward to learning about the draft process because he’s never even sat in a draft meeting, and that he “has a lot to learn.“\n\nHe reiterated that Cunningham is “driving this boat, and he’s the one that’s leading us moving forward,” but Ryan will be involved and helping out in any way he can. “This is Ian’s regular season right now; he is in it, and he is driving the ship for us.”\n\nEvery team has a primary and a secondary football executive position on file with the league, and no matter what that’s called from team to team, or what the responsibilities for each of those are, there’s no getting around the 1-2 front office hierarchy that each franchise has set up.",

    "description": "Phins fans share their thoughts and concerns with the team under the new leadership.",
    "fullText": "This past week, I asked the following question:\n\nNow that our Miami Dolphins have hired the new GM and nearly filled out the entire coaching staff, what concerns do you still have about either or both? Is it an individual coach that you believe could hold the team back, or is there another concern about the new makeup of the front office or the coaching staff as a whole? Or…maybe you think this is nearly perfect for what we want to see. Please let us know that and why as well.\n\nBelow are some of your thoughts and answers-\n\nLuvs2drnk just hopes this isn’t a case of wash-rinse-repeat.\n\nMy only concern right now is that we’re doing the same thing we’ve been doing for the past 21 years and expecting a different result.\n\ncoluccim knows that being mediocre is not acceptable.\n\nSame concern as before – the acceptance of mediocracy\n\nMiamiItaliano is concerned about the dire financial situation the team is in, cap-wise, due to horrible decisions made by the previous regime.\n\nThe concern is how Sully can build a team with so much dead money against the cap. It’s already at $35 million, before the 2 post-June 1st cuts. Assuming it’s Tua, that’s $67 million this season. Assuming it’s Chubb, that’s $10.9 million. Then there’s Tyreek, who’s probably getting cut ASAP with no post-June 1st designation. That’s $28.2 million dead cap. A total of $142 million of money the Dolphins can’t use this year. That means Sully has to absolutely nail the draft every year until they get out of cap hell.\n\nTheRoo1 hopes that the new regime sticks to the long game this time.\n\nConcerns? That while Sully and Haf have said the right things, now that they have the keys to the car, they decide to take a joy ride, and stray from the long game that they talked about.\n\nUSMCFinzFreak hopes the new guys aren’t just fill-ins for now.\n\nMy concern is if the staff is just a bridge staff, considering the cap space hell they inherited. I hope not, but we fans are impatient (and rightly so), especially after so many decades of mediocrity. We’ve been on an endless search to find our franchise quarterback, so I hope we can get out of quarterback purgatory soon, but first, the team needs to build a formidable OL before we bring in a QB. Chicken or egg, which one comes first? Sorry for the ramble……\n\nSlayerNation1 is concerned about the culture and if the owners’ priorities are in the right place.\n\nThe concern until proven otherwise: the “Dolphins’ Culture” overwhelms/brainwashes any regimes ability to break through the “Glass Ceiling of Mediocrity”\n\nIf the Dolphins were an SAT analogy:\n\nHigh NFLPA Player Grades are to Ross,\n\nwhat AFC Championships and Lombardis are to some owners.\n\n👆that’s my concern, different names=same net results\n\nEjplaya is concerned about the lack of talent on the roster and the lack of cap or a high enough draft pick to make an immediate difference.\n\nThe biggest concern is have with the staff is their lack of ammunition. They have very little talent on the roster, no cap space, and a first round draft pick outside the top 10. Tough to turn things around quickly without those things.\n\nMIAMI235 is concerned about the new regime having to learn as they go.\n\nConcern: Too much “ On The Job Learning “, as we have watched through the years.\n\nsdphinsfan wants to know whether they can walk the walk, not just talk the talk. Is also concerned that they will be able to compile the right level of talent.\n\nExecution. Haf and JES look and sound the part. Their background is just what you want. But you have to get the “right” players because for as much focus as we put on the FO and the coaching, it’s a players game and the players are what makes it happen. If you have the right players, its easier to go from 4 wins to 14 than it is to go from 7 to 11. When you’re stuck in the middle, it’s harder to make the changes you need to make because you think you are closer than you really are.\n\nUrthling has multiple concerns, inclusing the getting the culture right and the quarterback problem. Also, we are impatient. Damn right we are!\n\nWith an impatient fanbase and sometimes mercurial owner, will Haf and Sully get a fair shake to turn Miami around?\n\nWith the current QB, cap and roster situations it looks like it could take a few years.\n\nThere’s also the secondary concern of creating a “winning culture”, that might be difficult to accomplish if the next 1-2 seasons we pile up more losses than wins, unless the players feel that significant progress is being made.\n\nThat’s a laundry list, and every one of those concerns seems more than legit. Clearly, we are all concerned about the lack of a quality quarterback, a strong team culture of winning, and the overall lack of talent in the right positions on the roster. Let’s hope that they got it right this time, or it’s going to be another long, ugly ride for us in the fanbase. As always, thank you to each of you who come into our posts nearly every evening or the next morning and answer our question of the day.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United pulled off yet another Fergie time heist, this time away at West Ham United on Tuesday, as they came away from the London Stadium with a point.\n\nThe visitors were far from their fluent best and struggled to create anything of note, with the summer signings, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, unable to break down the Hammers’ low block.\n\nThe squad also appears ill-equipped to deal with the pressures of playing twice a week, and Michael Carrick’s blushes were only spared by a stoppage-time equaliser from Benjamin Sesko.\n\nThe Slovenian’s smart finish ensured United remained in fourth position in the Premier League table.\n\nTalking to TNT Sports after the match, the 22-year-old revealed that he was delighted with his goal but disappointed with the result.\n\nHe explained that the Red Devils lacked intensity, which was the main reason behind the disappointing performance.\n\n“I’m happy with my finish, but yeah, not so happy with the draw, because I know we deserve the win because we were fighting till the end.\n\n“Unfortunately, these days come when you’re a bit unlucky. Maybe the intensity was not exactly what it should be. But yeah, we were fighting. In the end, we got a draw, which is really important.”\n\nTo plenty of the away fans, it will almost feel like a win given the dramatic circumstances of the goal.\n\nThe former RB Leipzig striker also revealed that the camaraderie between the players and the desire to work as a unit have been helping the team over the line since Carrick came onboard.\n\n“We are working together no matter what is happening. If we are behind, if we are in front, it does not matter as we are always fighting.

But yeah, we managed to finish with one. We feel amazing. We are doing everything together. When difficult moments are coming, we’re facing it together, which is really important and can lead to the results like right now.”\n\nThe Slovenian international further explained that a bit more energy and focus will be required for the team to return to winning ways once they return to action in two weeks.\n\n“I think we just have to keep on going like we were doing the last games. Just we have to keep in mind that we have to breathe for each other, and we have to we have to take care in every single situations, every every second of the game, to be focused, to be on point, and obviously when the chances are coming to finish them.”\n\nFeature image Justin Setterfield via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

It's a minor league contract with an invite to big league spring training.\n\nWright, astoundingly, has 24 wins in his MLB career.

He had a combined 5.48 ERA.\n\nWright has been battered by his injuries, and so it's not clear he'll ever be the pitcher he once was.\n\nBut at least for now, he's quite the answer to a trivia question.\n\nTeam USA has a finalized WBC roster and an awesome lineup\n\nDominican Republic WBC roster is loaded with stars\n\nHow Trent Grisham's decision ruined the Yankees' offseason plans\n\nBuster Posey will change Hall of Fame voting forever\n\nThis Cubs replacement plan for Kyle Tucker looks smart\n\nInjury insurance is changing the World Baseball Classic",

The researchers found that the component activates a wallet app scanner looking for MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Binance, and Coinbase, logs wallet IDs and balances, and attempts clipboard address injection, replacing copied wallet addresses with attacker-controlled ones.\n\nThe bank stealer targets online banking apps, UPI platforms like Google Pay and PhonePe, and payment services such as Apple Pay and PayPal.

    "fullText": "Rules of mysterious ancient Roman board game decoded by AI\n\nA Roman stone board game has been unplayable since its discovery more than a century ago, but AI might have just worked out the rules\n\nJoin Our Community of Science Lovers!\n\nIt was the summer of 2020, and researcher Walter Crist was wandering around the exhibits inside a Dutch museum dedicated to the presence of the ancient Roman empire in the Netherlands. As a scientist who studies ancient board games, one exhibit stuck out to Crist: a stone game board dating to the late Roman Empire. It was about eight inches across and etched with angular lines that roughly formed the shape of an oblong octagon inside a rectangle.\n\n“I thought to myself, ‘Well, that’s very interesting,’ because the pattern on it—it’s not something I had ever seen in the literature before,” Crist says.\n\nWhat the game was called and how it was played were a mystery, too.\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nCrist contacted the museum curators to get a closer look. And now he and his colleagues believe they’ve decoded the game in a first-of-its-kind study using a combination of more traditional archaeological methods and artificial intelligence. According to the analysis, the object appears to be a sort of “blocking game.” In these types of games, one player tries to block another from moving; one example is tic-tac-toe.\n\nThe research was published on Monday in the journal Antiquity.\n\nCrist, now a guest lecturer at Leiden University in the Netherlands, recalls that when he and his team started investigating the board game, they didn’t have a ton of details to work with. They knew that the game board had been found around the late 1800s or early 1900s in the southeastern Netherlands’ city of Heerlen—which would have been the city of Coriovallum in Roman times. The board was made out limestone that was imported from France. And the game was likely played casually and may not have been particularly notable, in part because there is no known documentation of it in written texts from the time.\n\nTo decipher the rules, Crist’s team programmed two AI agents to play the game over and over again using more than 100 different sets of rules taken from other known European games, both ancient and modern. As the AI agents played—1,000 games per set of rules—the researchers tracked how the pieces moved. Then they compared the moves with the levels of wear on areas of the board, tracing which gameplay seemed to replicate grooves on the stone.\n\nThe team found nine rule sets that appeared “consistent” with the wear on the board. “And they were all variations of this same kind of blocking game,” Crist says.\n\nThis type of game was played in the 19th and 20th centuries in Scandinavia, and researchers thought it dated to early medieval times. But the Roman game is the earliest example of such a game in Europe, Crist says. He and his team called the game Ludus Coriovalli, Latin for “the game from Coriovallum.” (You can play it online here.)\n\nCrist hopes the study will help researchers solve other ancient board games. Such games offer a way to connect the ancient past to our own lives, he says. Indeed, they haven’t changed much over the centuries. The ancient Egyptian board game Senet, for example, might not have been all that different from Sorry! Chess, meanwhile, is thought to have originated in ancient India, and nobody really knows when or where backgammon originated.\n\nUnderstanding how ancient games might’ve been played, Crist says, “can lead us to new insights on how people in the past enjoyed their lives.”\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, I’d like to ask for your support.

    "description": "International team creates quick-charging, long-lasting prototype with potential for renewable energy storage",
    "fullText": "A little-known fact: In the year 1900, electric cars outnumbered gas-powered ones on the American road.\n\nThe lead-acid auto battery of the time, courtesy of Thomas Edison, was expensive and had a range of only about 30 miles. Seeking to improve on this, Edison believed the nickel-iron battery was the future, with the promise of a 100-mile range, a long life and a recharge time of seven hours, fast for that era.\n\nAlas, that promise never reached fruition. Early electric car batteries still suffered from serious limitations, and advances in the internal combustion engine won the day.\n\nNow, an international research collaboration co-led by UCLA has taken a page from Edison’s book, developing nickel-iron battery technology that may be well-suited for storing energy generated at solar farms. The prototype was able to recharge in only seconds, instead of hours, and achieved over 12,000 cycles of draining and recharging — the equivalent of more than 30 years of daily recharges.\n\nThe technology was built from tiny clusters of metal patterned using proteins that were then bonded to a two-dimensional material, made of sheets only one atom thick. Despite the innovative ingredients, the techniques are deceptively straightforward and inexpensive.\n\n“People often think of modern nanotechnology tools as complicated and high-tech, but our approach is surprisingly simple and straightforward,” said study co-author Maher El-Kady, an assistant researcher in the UCLA College’s chemistry and biochemistry department. “We are just mixing common ingredients, applying gentle heating steps and using raw materials that are widely available.”\n\nThe study was published in the journal Small and is featured on the back cover.\n\nThe natural world provided some cues for the researchers. Of particular interest was the process by which animals form bones and shellfish form their hard outer casings. Whether skeletons are inside or outside, they’re made by proteins that act as scaffolds for collecting calcium-based compounds.\n\nThe researchers sought to mimic this mechanism to generate their tiny clusters of nickel or iron, according to co-corresponding author Ric Kaner, a distinguished professor of chemistry and biochemistry in the UCLA College and of materials science and engineering in the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering.\n\n“We were inspired by the way nature deposits these types of materials,” said Kaner, who is also the holder of the Dr. Myung Ki Hong Endowed Chair in Materials Innovation and a member of the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA. “Laying down minerals in the correct fashion builds bones that are strong, yet flexible enough to not be brittle. How it’s done is almost as important as the material used, and proteins guide how they are placed.”\n\nIn the study, the team used proteins that are byproducts of beef production. The molecules served as templates for growing clusters of nickel for positive electrodes and iron for negative electrodes. The nooks and crannies in the folded protein structure limited the size of the metal clusters to fewer than 5 nanometers. That’s so small that it would take about 10,000 to 20,000 clusters to match the width of a human hair. The researchers even detected single atoms of iron and nickel in their electrodes.\n\nThe proteins were combined with graphene oxide, an ultrathin 2D material that comes in sheets a single atom thick comprising carbon decorated with oxygen atoms. While the oxygen can create clogs that make the material act more like an insulator, the process that followed changed everything.\n\nThe ingredients were superheated in water then baked at high-temperature, causing the proteins to char into carbon, stripping away the oxygen in the 2D material and embedding the tiny metal clusters guided by the proteins. The resulting structure was an aerogel, made of almost 99% air by volume.\n\nPart of the technology’s secret sauce is surface area — the more exposed, the more space for the reactions behind battery chemistry to take place.\n\nThere was plenty of such room provided by the graphene aerogel’s thinness and surplus of empty space. And the tininess of the metal nanoclusters takes advantage of a fundamental mathematical principle: as objects get smaller, the size of the exposed outer surface increases far more than volume does.\n\n“As we go from larger particles down to these extremely tiny nanoclusters, the surface area gets dramatically higher,” El-Kady said. “That’s a huge advantage for batteries. When the particles are that tiny, almost every single atom can participate in the reaction. So, charging and discharging happen way faster, you can store more charge, and the whole battery just works more efficiently.”\n\nDespite its advantages in charging speed and durability, this iteration of the technology does not match the storage capabilities of today’s lithium-ion batteries. With range at a premium in the electric car market, the researchers think that this Edison-inspired battery of the future may one day find application in other areas.\n\nFor instance, the technology’s fast charging, high output and robust endurance suggest a good fit for storing excess electricity generated at solar farms during the daytime, to power the grid at night. It may also be useful for backup power at data centers.\n\n“Because this technology could extend the lifetime of batteries to decades upon decades, it might be ideal for storing renewable energy or quickly taking over when power is lost,” El-Kady said. “This would remove worries about the changing cost of infrastructure.”\n\nThe researchers are exploring the use of their nanocluster fabrication technique with other metals. They’re also looking at possible replacements for bovine proteins, such as natural polymers that are more abundant, and thus less expensive and easier to scale up for future manufacturing.\n\nThe study’s first author is Habibeh Bishkul of Tarbiat Modares University in Tehran, Iran.

He ran a large portion of the company until late last year, when several of his responsibilities were split between two other cofounders, Tony Wu and Guodong Zhang, people with knowledge of the move told Business Insider.\n\nBa also previously ran the team that oversaw more than a thousand AI tutors, according to an org chart from earlier last year. That role was given to Diego Pasini in September, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nBa is the second cofounder to depart the company in less than 48 hours. Wu announced he'd resigned from the AI startup on Monday night. Wu's Slack account was deactivated shortly before the announcement, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nAhead of Wu's departure, xAI underwent another restructuring, and several of his responsibilities were shifted under Zhang.\n\nMusk launched the AI company in 2023 with 11 other founders. Six have now left the company — five of them within the last year.\n\nIn addition to his work at xAI, Ba is an assistant professor at the University of Toronto in the computer science department. He received his Ph.D. from the school while studying under Nobel Prize winner Geoffrey Hinton, often referred to as the \"godfather of AI.\"\n\nMusk has said he built xAI as an alternative to what he's called \"woke\" chatbots, like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Over the past year, the company has become known for pushing the envelope. Last July, xAI launched a sexy digital avatar called \"Ani,\" and its Grok chatbot went on an antisemitic rant.\n\nMost recently, xAI has come under fire after Grok began generating nonconsensual sexual images of real people in response to X user prompts. The backlash eventually prompted the company to restrict Grok's image-generation features on X.\n\nLast week, Musk announced that xAI would merge with his rocket company, SpaceX. The company is reportedly gearing up for an initial public offering this year that could value SpaceX at $1.5 trillion.\n\nBa and xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDo you work for xAI or have a tip?

    "title": "The future of coding agents is vertical integration (and why ACP matters)",
    "description": "A look at the limitations of generic agents and MCPs, through the lens of building Tidewave, and what this means for the future of coding agents",
    "fullText": "The first appearances of coding agents were within our editors, as a natural progression from tab autocompletion. When Claude Code was released, almost a year ago, it innovated in many ways, particularly by demonstrating that although we write almost all of our code in editors, the agents themselves don’t have to be constrained to IDEs. As a result, most of our agentic development moved to the terminal.\n\nWith the release of the Codex App, we will start to see a push towards richer interfaces. However, this raises the question: if we can run coding agents anywhere, where is the best place to run them?\n\nIn this section, I will talk about Tidewave, the coding agent we built for full-stack web development. It is a sales pitch but I hope it is a good example of what we can gain by building vertical coding agents.\n\nTidewave was born out of frustration when using coding agents to build web applications. I frequently stumbled upon scenarios such as:\n\nThe agent would tell me a feature was complete, but when I tried it in the browser, form submission would not complete\n\nWhenever I encountered an exception page during development, I had to copy and paste stacktraces from the browser to the agent\n\nI had to constantly translate what was on the page to source code. If I wanted to “Add an Export to CSV button to a dropdown button”, the first step was typically to find where the template or component the dropdown was defined in\n\nUltimately, because the coding agent was unable to interact with or see what it produced, I had to act as the middleman:\n\nAnd while things have improved within the last year, most of the tooling out there does not fully close this gap. For example, while coding agents can read logs and editors like Cursor do include a browser, they do not correlate the browser actions with the logs, leaving space for guess work and context bloat. Or when the browser renders a page, it doesn’t know which controller or template it came from.\n\nWe solved this problem by moving the coding agent to the browser and making it aware of your web app:\n\nYou open up Tidewave in your favorite browser and its agent can now interact with the page you are looking at, validating the application works as desired by accessing the DOM, loading pages, filling forms, etc\n\nWhen something goes wrong, we parse and feed the exact information from the rendered error page. We also include any console.log and server logs related to the particular agent action (instead of the whole history)\n\nWhen you inspect an element in Tidewave, we automatically map DOM elements to source files. If you inspect a dropdown, we tell the agent its location on the page as well as the template/component it came from in the source code\n\nThe coding agent has access to your backend too, so it can read documentation, execute SQL queries, and even gets a REPL-like environment. So when the agent gets stuck, it can navigate the data, run code, and explore APIs, like any developer would\n\nMore importantly, this is all implemented by connecting the agent to your running application. You can ask your agent to analyze cache usage in your Rails application or to debug a LiveView in Phoenix, and it can do so because they talk to each other directly. Your agent is no longer limited to a series of bash commands.\n\nOverall, the agent becomes more capable, and we no longer need to act as the middleman:\n\nFor all of the above to work, instead of building a generic agent that works with every tool, Tidewave directly integrates with each web framework we support (Django, FastAPI, Flask, Next.js, Phoenix, Rails, and TanStack Start), mapping all layers to the agent, from the database to UI.\n\nAnd that’s what I mean by vertical integration: coding agents become integrated into the specific platform or runtime they’re building for. They understand the relationship between code and its live behavior, and can debug both.\n\nWe can easily draw parallels between the above and other domains. Agents for mobile development must have full access to a simulator to interact with the app UI, translate view hierarchies to source code, and monitor network requests. Similar patterns could apply to IoT devices, game development, etc.\n\nAs a matter of fact, this isn’t even a new idea. Data scientists were the first to embed agents directly into their notebooks, where they can execute code, visualize results, inspect dataframes, etc. They were the first to realize the benefit of vertically integrating agents and everyone else is just late to the party.\n\nBut how can we make these vertical integrations possible? If we want agents to access our runtimes and environments, could MCPs be the tool to make this a reality? That’s what we originally thought…\n\nTidewave was first prototyped as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and it quickly became obvious it wasn’t enough. In this section, I’ll focus on how MCPs can be detrimental to user experience. In particular, we’ll look at its limitations as a pull-only interface and its text-based constraints.\n\nAs an example, let’s look at Figma’s MCP. It allows developers to select an element in Figma’s desktop app and ask the agent to implement the design. Here’s a screenshot from their announcement:\n\nAs you can see, you’re required to make a selection in Figma, then explicitly ask the agent to query your selection. The agent then proceeds to talk to Figma and get the relevant data. That’s a lot of unecessary back and forth! If I already selected an element on Figma, it should take a single click to embed that information into my prompt.\n\nNow imagine if, every time I inspected an element in the browser, we had to tell the agent to ask the browser about the selection. We refused to implement that. Instead, we made it just work:\n\nFurthermore, by making the inspected elements part of our prompt, you can select multiple elements and dictate how they all need to change at once. You can reorder, swap, and coordinate multiple changes easily.\n\nSimilarly, when you see an error page in the browser, you should only need to click a button to fix it - not copy and paste stacktraces or ask the agent to read logs.\n\nNone of this could be built with MCPs because they are pull-based. The agent decides when to invoke the MCP and you are forced to ask the agents to perform actions on your behalf. MCPs do not allow us to attach rich metadata to prompts either.\n\nImagine you need help addressing comments in a pull request. You can tell the agent to use GitHub’s MCP or even use a custom skill that uses GitHub’s CLI to fetch all current comments. But once the agent does its initial assessment, all further exchanges happens through text: “ignore this comment”, “no, not this comment, the one above it”.\n\nNow compare that to using any graphical (or even a terminal) interface: we can reply in thread, comment on specific lines, or click a button to dismiss invalid feedback altogether. In other words, when we put our integrations behind MCPs, all exchange happens on text, and we often end-up with worse user experiences.\n\nInstead, our goal is to build agentic tools and user experiences side-by-side. For example, when we added Web Accessibility diagnostics to Tidewave, we exposed additional tools to the agent, but we also provided a polished experience for when developers want to remain in the loop:\n\nOur recently announced Supabase integration works the same: it runs performance and security advisors on your database and present them to you. If you want to dig deeper, you can do it all through a rich interface. And if you don’t care about any of that, you can either click the “Fix all” button or ask your agent to do it for you.\n\nTo build these experiences, we had to invert the control. We don’t want the agent to call us, we want our tools to call the agent.\n\nSay you want to build your own agentic loop, up until recently, doing so meant to:\n\nWhile the above is already a lot of work, you must remember that prompt engineering, tool calls, etc. must be fine-tuned per model. For example, when OpenAI announced GPT-5-Codex, integrators had to write new prompts and new tools, even if they already supported GPT-5.\n\nAnd the above covers only the basic loop! What about AGENTS.md, MCPs, or skills? And you haven’t even started working on what makes your coding agent unique.\n\nLuckily for us, many of the leading AI companies have built their own coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI) tailored to their models, and many have exposed those agents through SDKs. We also have fantastic open source alternatives. This means you can cut out much of the work above, but, if you want to support multiple providers, you’re still on the hook for integrating them one by one.\n\nThat’s exactly where the Agent Client Protocol from the Zed team comes in. It standardizes communication with coding agents, so you implement one protocol and support multiple agents at once. This ultimately allows you to focus on the runtime integrations and user experiences that make your coding agent unique.\n\nFurthermore, even if you’re not implementing your own agent, ACP should matter to you because it brings portability to developers. You can use a single coding agent across the terminal, your editor, and Tidewave, reusing the same settings for hooks, skills, and subagents. And perhaps more importantly, the same subscription.\n\nWe are big fans of the Agent Client Protocol and we are excited to build on top of it alongside companies like Zed and JetBrains.\n\nGeneric agents that work everywhere force awkward workflows where we constantly act as a middleman. Instead, we want to embed agents into the platforms we are building on, so they can see the relationship between code and behavior, interact with live apps, and debug in real-time.\n\nHowever, to build these rich experiences, we need to invert the control and own the agentic loop. The Agent Client Protocol (ACP) allows us to do so by standardizing communication across providers, so we can focus on the user experiences and integrations that make our coding agents unique, instead of wrestling with multiple SDKs.\n\nI hope this article inspires you to fine-tune your own coding agents and, if you are looking for a coding agent tailored to full-stack web development, give Tidewave a try!",

    "fullText": "Through carbon dating, researchers have ruled that the artifacts are between approximately 11,700 and 12,900 years old, a time when Ice Age temperatures had returned after a brief warm period.\n\nResearchers have identified what is believed to be the world's oldest sewn animal hide, along with Ice Age eyed bone needles, discovered in Oregon, according to researchers from a consortium of North American universities.\n\nThe study, published in Science Advances, analyzed 55 artifacts discovered in the Cougar Mountain Cave (CMC) and Paisley Caves in central Oregon, and Smith Creek Cave and Bonneville Estates Rockshelter in Nevada, though the significant findings were discovered in the former two.\n\nThrough carbon dating, researchers have ruled that the artifacts are between approximately 11,700 and 12,900 years old, a time when Ice Age temperatures had returned after a brief warm period.\n\nCMC was originally dug up in 1958 by an amateur archaeologist named John Cowles. The artifacts analyzed in the study are part of Cowles’ original collection of excavated findings, now housed at the Favell Museum in Klamath Falls, Oregon.\n\nPaisley Caves, or Paisley Five Mile Point Caves, were first studied by archaeologist Luther Cressman in the 1930s, and were added to the US National Register of Historic Places in 2014.\n\nAccording to researchers, the most remarkable find was a piece of elk hide with thread sewn through its edge. The thread, which researchers determined was made from plant fiber and animal hair twisted together, connected the main hide piece to a smaller fragment, which is tied in a knot.\n\nThe hide was dated three times to confirm an age of roughly 12,000 years, according to the study, and chemical analysis confirmed it came from a North American elk.\n\nResearchers also studied 14 bone needles from four different sites and determined that they had been carved from the bones of both bison and mountain sheep.\n\n“In all of North America, there are only 17 sites with bone needles in Pleistocene-aged [Ice Age] contexts, while in South America, there are none,” according to the study.\n\nThe two caves contain 80% of all the dated plant and animal materials from the Ice Age period found anywhere in North or South America, the study explained, noting that 23 fiber artifacts, 12 wooden tools, and three pieces of hide had been found in CMC alone.\n\nThe fiber artifacts are mostly three-strand braided rope made from sagebrush bark, and fragments of tightly woven basketry were also found, marking the oldest evidence of baskets in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe caves also contained 79 stone spear points, many resharpened multiple times, alongside bison, elk, and rabbit bones.\n\n“The abundance of bone needles and the presence ofadornment items and very fine eyed needles suggest that clothingwas more than a utilitarian survival strategy but also an avenue of expression and identity,” the study concluded.\n\n“This evidence pushes beyond conventional assumptions to confirm that Pleistocene peoples in the Americas used clothing as both survival technology andsocial practice.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House says President Donald Trump has the right to amend a permit for a new bridge between Canada and Michigan, prolonging the latest dispute between the U.S. and its northern neighbor hours after its prime minister signaled there could be a detente.\n\nThe Gordie Howe International Bridge, which would connect Ontario and Michigan and would be a vital economic artery between the two countries, is scheduled to open in early 2026. But Trump has now threatened to block the bridge from being opened, calling for Canada to agree to a litany of unspecified demands as the two nations prepare to renegotiate a sprawling trade pact later this year.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said earlier Tuesday that he spoke with Trump and expressed confidence that the spat would be resolved. But a White House official later Tuesday said the ownership structure of the bridge remains unacceptable for the U.S. president.\n\nCanada paid for the bridge, named after a Canadian-born Detroit Red Wings hockey star. Construction has been underway since 2018.\n\nThe official said that all international infrastructure projects require a presidential permit, and that Trump would be within his right to amend that permit. The person was granted anonymity because they did not have permission to speak publicly.\n\n“The fact that Canada will control what crosses the Gordie Howe Bridge and owns the land on both sides is unacceptable to the president,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday. “It’s also unacceptable that more of this bridge isn’t being built with more American-made materials.”\n\nThe new fight over the bridge is the latest volley in an increasingly sour relationship between the United States and Canada, particularly over trade policy. Trump has also mused publicly about acquiring Canada as the 51st U.S. state, much to the dismay of Canadians.\n\nFollowing his conversation with Trump, Carney said “this is going to be resolved” and noted that he told the U.S. president that the Canadian and Michigan governments shared ownership of the bridge. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office has also emphasized that the bridge will be operated under a joint ownership agreement between the state and Canada, even though the Canadian government paid for it.\n\nCarney also added that U.S. steel was used in the project, which also employed U.S. workers. According to Carney, Trump told him he’ll ask the U.S. ambassador to Canada, former Michigan Rep. Pete Hoekstra, to “play a role in smoothing the conversation in and around the bridge.”\n\nHoekstra did not return an immediate request for comment.\n\n“I look forward to it opening and what is particularly important is the commerce and the tourism of Canadians and Americans that go across that bridge,” Carney said.\n\nThe project was negotiated by former Michigan Republican Gov. Rick Snyder and paid for by the Canadian government to help ease congestion over the existing Ambassador Bridge and Detroit-Windsor tunnel.\n\nSnyder wrote in an op-ed in The Detroit News on Tuesday that Trump was wrong in asserting that Canada owns both the U.S.- and Canadian sides of the Gordie Howe bridge.\n\n“Canada and the state of Michigan are 50/50 owners of the new bridge,\" Snyder wrote. “Canada was wonderful and financed the entire bridge. They will get repaid with interest from the tolls. Michigan and the United States got their half-ownership with no investment.”\n\nThe former governor also emphasized that parts of the bridge construction were exempt from “Buy America” requirements for its steel because half of the project was outside the U.S. and subsequently, U.S. law should not apply to them.\n\n“President Trump, I would encourage you to challenge your advisers and the sources for your post to correct the information they have provided,” Snyder wrote in the op-ed. He acknowledged some trade issues with Canada, but “picking this bridge as the leverage point doesn’t seem to make the most sense given your other tools.\"",

    "description": "Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) said “there aren’t anywhere close to the votes” needed to change the Senate’s filibuster rule to allow Republican-sponsored legislation to reform voter regis...",
    "fullText": "Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) said “there aren’t anywhere close to the votes” needed to change the Senate’s filibuster rule to allow Republican-sponsored legislation to reform voter registration requirements to pass the upper chamber with fewer than 60 votes.\n\nThune on Tuesday dismissed the idea that Republicans might lower the procedural threshold for advancing the House-passed SAVE Act, which would require people to show passports or birth certificates as proof of citizenship when registering to vote.\n\nThune said he supports passing federal law to require documented proof of citizenship when registering to vote, but he dismissed talk of changing the Senate rules to create a pathway to passing the legislation, which Democrats strongly oppose.\n\nThune pledged to protect the Senate’s filibuster rule, which requires 60 votes to advance legislation, when he ran for Senate majority leader in 2024.\n\nHe said his position is broadly supported within the Senate Republican Conference.\n\n“It’s not just me not being willing to do it. There aren’t anywhere close to the votes, not even close, to nuking the filibuster,” he said of a proposal to lower the threshold for advancing legislation to a simple majority by voting along partisan lines to establish new precedent.\n\nEffectively changing the Senate’s rules with a party-line vote overruling the presiding chair or Senate parliamentarian is viewed as so extreme that it’s nicknamed “the nuclear option.”\n\nThune said the proposal “doesn’t have a future. Is there another way of getting there? We’ll see,” he said.\n\nThune made his comments after Senate Steering Committee Chair Mike Lee (R-Utah) made a pitch to the Senate GOP conference Tuesday to interpret the current Senate rules to require Democrats to continuously hold the floor with active debate to block the SAVE Act or other items on President Trump’s agenda.\n\n“We’re having a very robust conversation among our Senate Republican colleagues about the path forward. I think most are supporters … I certainly am — of the SAVE Act and what it attempts to accomplish,” Thune told reporters after the meeting.\n\n“You ought to be able to prove that you’re a citizen of this country in order to be able to vote. How we get to that vote remains to be seen,” he said.\n\nThune last week signaled his reluctance to require Democrats to stand at their desks on the Senate floor for hours on end in order to make it more arduous for them to block the SAVE Act.\n\nThe GOP leader warned that reinterpreting how the Senate’s filibuster rule is deployed could tie up the floor for weeks.\n\n“There are a lot of implications and ramifications to that, that I think our conference would need to have a conversation about. Obviously, it ties up the floor indefinitely, so it means you’re not doing other things. There’s always an opportunity cost,” Thune said, referring to the so-called standing filibuster\n\nHe warned that requiring Democrats to actively hold the floor is an “exercise that would go on for an indefinite period of time.”\n\nOther GOP senators have poured cold water on the idea of requiring a standing or talking filibuster.\n\nSenate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) cautioned that reinterpreting the filibuster rule would “change the Senate” and likely lead to the abolition of the minority party’s ability to hold up legislation.\n\n“Filibuster changes, I think, change the Senate. It may happen one day, but I don’t think it’s a good idea,” he said.\n\n“Because the Senate becomes the House,” he added, referring to the strict majoritarian rule in the lower chamber.",

    "description": "Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said total spending is up across US consumers, but some are doubling down on value.",
    "fullText": "Coca-Cola (KO) stock fell as much as 4% early Tuesday after the company offered what CEO James Quincey called a \"prudent\" outlook for 2026 as it aims to reverse pressure on international sales.\n\n\"We've taken what we think is a realistic, but prudent, approach relative to a number of international markets [where] we need to see improve through the course of 2026,\" Quincey told Yahoo Finance.\n\nWhich international markets are pressuring Coca-Cola's growth?\n\nWhy did Coca-Cola stock fall after earnings?\n\nHow are zero-sugar products performing for Coca-Cola?\n\nWhat leadership changes are happening at Coca-Cola?\n\nIn the fourth quarter, organic revenue grew 5% across the company's geographies, outpacing the 4.8% growth expected by Wall Street. For 2026, the company expects organic sales to grow 4%-5%, below the 5% growth expected by analysts, according to Bloomberg data. Coca-Cola's adjusted earnings are expected to grow in a range of 7%-8% this year after growing 9% in 2025.\n\nSome regions where the company is experiencing pressure include China, India, and Mexico, where a soft drink tax was recently implemented. Sales in its Asia Pacific region were flat in the fourth quarter.\n\nRead more about Coca-Cola's stock moves and today's market action.\n\nIn North America, the company said volumes grew 1% while prices were up 4% in the fourth quarter as consumers continued to turn to less-sugary options.\n\n\"You see strength [in] Coke Zero, even Diet Coke is growing,\" Quincey said. Across all geographies, volumes for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar were up 13% in the fourth quarter and 14% for the full year. Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Light volume was up 2% for the quarter and flat for the year.\n\n\"The protein — Fairlife, Core Power — is growing,\" Quincey said. \"The hydration ... BodyArmor is growing volume and gaining share. Similarly with some of the water,\" he added, regarding the US market.\n\nAs zero or low-sugar sodas continue to gain share, the company tested a Simply Pop prebiotic soda to compete with PepsiCo's $2 billion Poppi acquisition, but it's slow going, Quincey said.\n\n\"It's still very early days ... We leveraged some of our learnings from Coca-Cola Plus from Japan ... we're still trying to learn what really makes that subcategory tick,\" he said.\n\nAs for how bifurcated consumer habits in the US are impacting the business, Quincey said \"total spending is holding up,\" but consumers are picking and choosing how many and where they're buying.\"\n\n\"Lower-income consumers are doing value-based shopping,\" Quincey said. \"Whether that's the dollar channel or any other channel, and so we've had a clear affordability strategy over the last few years, and we think that's working for us.\"",

This includes employees working on solutions teams, sales, corporate development, and others. \n\nSchindler said America's large customer sales teams and other customer-facing roles would not be eligible for the programs.\n\n\"While all GBO functions are essential to our long-term strategy, we've decided not to offer VEP for these particular roles to limit as much disruption to our customers as possible,\" he wrote.\n\nGoogle has made similar offers to employees in other orgs over the past year.

    "description": "Matt Dolitsky’s video of the 110-foot vessel drew hundreds of thousands of views — and later, a court summons.",
    "fullText": "On a quiet bend of the South River, where feathery reeds crowd the shoreline and the mud smells faintly sour when the tide slips out, a 110-foot yacht sits wedged in a narrow creek.\n\nIts hull is rusted through in places. The deck sags. Graffiti and vines climb its bulwarks. Small trees have begun to grow in what were once staterooms.\n\nFor years, the vessel was mostly a curiosity, spotted from above by drone or on Google Maps and whispered about in Sayreville bars and online forums.\n\nThen, last fall, it became a courtroom problem.\n\nMatt Dolitsky, a YouTuber who explores abandoned places in New Jersey and New York for his channel Two Feet Outdoors, is scheduled to go on trial Feb. 26 in Sayreville Municipal Court.\n\nThe 55-year-old’s alleged crime? Trespassing, when he decided to paddle out and explore the wrecked yacht.\n\nHis November 2024 video documenting the trip has drawn more than 337,000 views — and, months later, a summons accusing him of unlawfully entering private property.\n\n“My focus was on the boat,” Dolitsky said in an interview with NJ.com. “You see this massive boat in this tiny little creek and wonder how it got there.”\n\nDolitsky’s videos are typically quiet, almost meditative. He glides through waterways and climbs into decaying structures, narrating what he sees. His fans describe them as calming, the type of vlogs you can watch while getting ready for bed.\n\nIn the yacht video, he kayaks up to the vessel during low tide. He climbs onto its weathered dock, crawls through brush and shimmies onto the deck, marveling at its scale and condition.\n\n“Nobody has a clue that I’m over here,” Dolitsky says at one point, his shadow cast against a smokestack as a truck beeps somewhere in the distance.\n\nWhat he did not expect was the notice that appeared in his mailbox six months later, warning that someone had filed a trespassing complaint against him in municipal court.\n\n“I was kind of shocked,” Dolitsky said. “I was thinking, ‘How is that even possible?’”\n\nThe complaint, filed last June, alleges that on Nov. 1, 2024, Dolitsky kayaked to the property, crossed onto private land and boarded the yacht.\n\nTrespassing is a petty disorderly persons offense in Sayreville, punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a fine of up to $500.\n\nWatch \"Urban Kayaking Adventure | Exploring an Abandoned 110 ft. Yacht Stuck in a Creek\" on YouTubeWatch\n\nThe charge was filed by Kersten Kortbawi, who owns the property the yacht sits on and the surrounding area. Much of the space is taken up by Viking Terminal, an industrial park that rents to commercial businesses.\n\nKortbawi did not respond to a request for comment from NJ.com.\n\nIn a prior statement to the Home News Tribune, she said “No Trespassing” signs have been posted around the property for decades and that Dolitsky’s own video shows one as he approached the dock from the river.\n\n“Importantly, the yellow-and-black ‘No Trespassing’ sign is shown in his YouTube video as he approached the dock on his kayak,” Kortbawi said.\n\nDolitsky disputes that account, saying he saw no such signage at the time and believes additional signs were installed afterward.\n\n“I didn’t see any ‘No Trespassing’ signs or anything saying, ‘Private Property,’” he said. “I guarantee after the fact they put up signs.”\n\nIn a video he posted in August updating his viewers on the case, he kayaks back to the dock, where a ‘No Trespassing’ sign can indeed be seen affixed to a post.\n\nThat same post is bare in his original November 2024 video.\n\nThe yacht has a longer, more mysterious history than the case surrounding it.\n\nThe vessel is listed on Google Maps as the Blue Jacket, a luxury motor vessel built in the Netherlands in the 1950s.\n\nIt’s not clear exactly when it fell into disrepair or was brought to Viking Terminal.\n\nBrian Swider, who rented space at the terminal from 1990 to 1995 for his concrete company, remembers the property’s owners — Kortbawi’s parents, Peter and Donna Roehsler — once had grand plans to restore the yacht to its former glory.\n\n“He was into his boats,” Swider said of Peter Roehsler, who died in 2011. Donna died in 2023.\n\n“They had a crew of people working on that yacht the whole time I was down there,” Swider continued. “They dumped a lot of time and money into it. To see it the way it is now — it’s a shame.”\n\nSwider said the Roehslers ordered new engine parts, but later discovered that the hull’s engine mounts were “beyond repair.”\n\n“That’s when he put it up in the creek there,” Swider said. “I lost track after I moved out.”\n\nSince then, the yacht remained largely — but not entirely — undisturbed.\n\nOther YouTubers have documented themselves aboard the vessel in recent years. In one popular 2020 video, now deleted, two men kayak directly up to it, crossing a makeshift gangway of PVC pipes and stepping onto the deck.\n\nThey explore the yacht, not yet covered in graffiti, and remark on the smell of stagnant water and decay.\n\n“Oh man, this thing is Stinkersville,” one says.\n\nThe other poses on the roof like Leonardo DiCaprio’s character in “Titanic,” arms flung wide: “I’m the king of the world!”\n\nNeither man has been charged with a crime, and neither responded to requests for comment.\n\nIt’s unclear if Kortbawi was aware of this video or others like it, and if so, why she didn’t file complaints in those cases.\n\nKortbawi is a civil litigation attorney and sits on the board of trustees of the Middlesex County Bar Association.\n\nShe left her commercial firm last November, according to her LinkedIn profile, which lists her current employment as owner of Viking Terminal Holdings, LLC.\n\n“How is it possible a prominent attorney has a derelict yacht sitting abandoned in a creek?” Dolitsky asks in an update video posted to his channel late last year.\n\nNew Jersey has long had a problem with abandoned boats. But the yacht in Sayreville probably doesn’t meet that definition.\n\nThat’s because Kortbawi owns both the vessel and the waterway in which it’s moldering.\n\nA public relations firm retained by the Borough of Sayreville told Patch last month that the yacht “is not abandoned” and “is owned by a private company.”\n\nStill, its rusting and rotting may pose an environmental risk to its surroundings, some say. Dolitsky believes it does, pointing to visible holes in the hull and flooded engine compartments.\n\n“When the water comes in and goes out, I can only imagine all the fluids that were in that yacht at some point leaked out,” he said. “Diesel, oil, things like that.”\n\nKortbawi told the Home News Tribune that those claims are baseless, noting that inspections by county and municipal agencies found no oil leakage.\n\nThe case has unfolded slowly since Dolitsky received his summons in June. A mediation session with Kortbawi preceded his probable cause hearing, but it collapsed almost immediately, he says.\n\n“I was willing to mediate — that’s why I was there,” he said. “But if one party doesn’t want to mediate, then it goes to trial.”\n\nDolitsky has had no other contact with Kortbawi, whose motivations remain unknown.\n\n“It’s not like, if they fine me, she gets the money,” he said. “I don’t know what she’s getting out of it. Maybe she wants to make an example out of me.”\n\nIn New Jersey’s municipal courts, anyone with firsthand knowledge of a violation can file a citizen complaint, and the court may hold a probable cause hearing to decide if the case moves forward.\n\nSayreville police were not involved in the charge, nor did they investigate the complaint, according to Lt. James Novak, a department spokesperson.\n\nIt’s unclear how much the case is costing Sayreville taxpayers to prosecute Dolitsky.\n\nA spokesperson for the borough did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did John Krenzel, the municipal prosecutor handling the case.\n\nThe drawn-out process has taken a toll on Dolitsky.\n\n“Who wants to have charges looming over their head?” he said. “Especially over something that, in my opinion, seems so petty.”\n\nOnline, the case has become a minor cause célèbre among fans of “urban exploration” videos and creators who see public waterways and abandoned structures as fair game.\n\nDolitsky, whose YouTube channel is his full-time career, insists he is not interested in controversy.\n\n“I care about what I do and where I go,” he said. “I try to leave places better than I find them. I’m not out there trying to cause harm.”",

    "title": "I've got all the parenting skills. I just don't use them when I care for my grandkids.",
    "description": "A grandmother reflects on spending three weeks caring for her grandkids and learning how parenting has changed since she raised her own children.",
    "fullText": "My grandchildren live 3000 miles away, so I don't get to see them nearly as often as I'd like. Recently, I took a three-week break from my regularly scheduled life to help take care of them while their nanny was away. My son and daughter-in-law both work full-time, and I was eager to pitch in and help with school runs, meal prep, baths, and bedtime.\n\nIt didn't seem that long ago that I was the primary caregiver for my five children, so the daily routine felt very familiar. So familiar, in fact, that it was easy to fall back into old patterns. However, my old routine from years ago did not work for these children. They had their own way of doing things, and it was my turn to adapt.\n\nMy granddaughter and I bonded immediately when we first met, just a few weeks after her birth. The next time I visited, she was 9 months old, that tricky age when babies become shy around strangers. My daughter-in-law warned me that she might not be receptive to my overtures of love. She proved us wrong. She immediately reached for me and snuggled deeply into my arms.\n\nOur connection has only grown since then. Despite my infrequent visits, she always eagerly greets me and monopolizes my time, which is fine with me.\n\nMy grandson, on the other hand, has taken a while to warm up to me. It wasn't until several days into this most recent visit that he allowed me to pick him up. We made our greatest connections when I fed him. I think we're friends now.\n\nOur mornings started differently when my kids were 5 and 2. No lollygagging in our house; just get up, get dressed, and eat breakfast before heading out the door. This household eases into the day more gently. I admit much of the urgency that dictated how I started out my days was a response to my fear of showing up anywhere late, a battle I still wage.\n\nMy granddaughter's school has a flexible start time with an anticipated arrival somewhere between 8:30 a.m. and 9 a.m. Even if she's late, there are no penalties.\n\nThe car ride to school proved to be quite challenging. I'd always encouraged my kids to look out the window and observe the world around them. This child preferred a few minutes playing games on my phone. It's one of the few times during the day she's allowed to interact with screens. It was tough to oblige, though, because I needed Google Maps to direct me to her school. We agreed that she could use the phone on the ride home in the afternoon, and peace was restored.\n\nCaring for a preschooler and a toddler requires skilled negotiations. In this household, I needed a primer from Mom and Day to learn what the bargaining chips were. More often than not, a promise of more time with their parents was the key to navigating our days together.\n\nI learned that the hard way on the day I promised my granddaughter she'd see her mom as soon as school ended. What I meant was as soon as we got home from school, not in the parking lot. She'd had such a broad smile as she bounced out of her classroom that immediately transformed into a pout when she realized Nana was picking her up, not her beloved Mama.\n\nMy son and daughter-in-law are truly doing a wonderful job raising their children. There is no reason for me to offer unsolicited advice about how to care for them. That became abundantly clear the morning I suggested my grandson take his nap in his crib instead of in his mother's arms. It was easy to see how tired she was and how his nap would give her a much-needed break, but the baby would only fall asleep in his mother's arms. My suggestion was not helpful.\n\nWe have much more fun together when I'm not in charge. It's a pleasure turning the responsibility back over to Mom and Dad so the children and I can paint, mold Play-Doh, and read books together.\n\nI want to be a helpful grandmother. I'll likely not stop offering suggestions on how to raise these two beautiful children, but I will shut my mouth when I see that what they're doing is working.",

    "description": "The CEO of StackBlitz, Eric Simons, says the web development startup has \"gone all in\" on AI agents.",
    "fullText": "StackBlitz CEO Eric Simons aims to have more AI agents than human employees working at the startup this year, a milestone he sees as emblematic of a broader shift underway across the software industry.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Business Insider, Simons said StackBlitz has \"gone all in on agents,\" deploying internally built AI systems across business intelligence, coding, product development, customer support, and outbound sales.\n\nAI has become increasingly good at writing software code, to the point where the technology is beginning to change how companies are run. OpenClaw, an open-source AI assistant that works inside platforms like WhatsApp, Slack, and iMessage, is an early example of digital agents communicating and coordinating with one another without direct human involvement.\n\n\"To me, this is a crystal ball into the wildness of the inevitable future,\" Simons told Business Insider. \"Your AI agents will talk to other people's agents on your behalf, negotiating pricing for a product you want to buy, inquiring about availability for a restaurant, arguing your political viewpoints.\"\n\n\"Agents are an extension of yourself,\" he added. \"People will generally trust their agents with whatever they recommend them to buy, reserve, believe, or otherwise.\"\n\nSimons's comments come as software and SaaS stocks have slumped in recent weeks, a move he attributes to growing investor recognition that AI can now build software autonomously. As AI tools become more capable, he said, long-standing competitive moats based on specialized knowledge are eroding.\n\nHe compared the shift to the transformation of manufacturing over the past century. Craft knowledge once protected businesses, he said, but automation and digital design ultimately displaced many incumbents. \"Today, it's a CAD file you can 3D print,\" Simons said.\n\n\"While every individual does not use these profound new powers directly (like 3D printing a chair), there's an entire new generation of companies that do — and they have replaced the previous era of companies,\" Simons explained. \"They disrupted those incumbents by leveraging automation that made it far cheaper and at a massive scale not possible previously when moats were just knowledge and bare hands.\"\n\nFor businesses, the implications are stark. Even traditionally \"safe\" enterprise software may be vulnerable if AI agents can migrate or rebuild systems rapidly.\n\n\"What does it mean when all of software can be written, rewritten, migrated, or otherwise, 100x or 10,000x faster than it could've ever been done before, by a workforce that does not sleep, and can be parallelized near infinitely?\" Simons said. \"It's daunting and mind-bending, and I think the repricing of SaaS in public markets more accurately reflects this today.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "In leaked comments, CEO Antonio Filosa told Stellantis employees he was inspired by full-time office culture during a recent trip to San Francisco.",
    "fullText": "Automaker Stellantis is taking a page from Silicon Valley's \"hardcore\" culture when it comes to remote work.\n\nCEO Antonio Filosa told staff at a Friday all-hands that Stellantis could take inspiration from AI and software startups after it announced a five-day office return policy, according to a transcript an employee shared with Business Insider.\n\nResponding to an employee question about the RTO mandate, Filosa said he was further convinced about the benefits of in-office work by a trip to San Francisco at the start of the year, according to the transcript, the accuracy of which was confirmed to Business Insider by four other Stellantis employees.\n\nFilosa told employees that he connected with multiple software companies during the trip and saw many people working in the office.\n\nHe singled out a visit to AI startup Applied Intuition, which partners with Stellantis to develop vehicle infotainment systems, and said he was impressed by the software company's engineers working and collaborating full-time in the office.\n\nStellantis, which is a much larger company, should be just as focused on in-office collaboration, Filosa said, adding that he wanted employees to work together.\n\nA spokesperson for Stellantis told Business Insider that the company does not comment on internal business meetings.\n\nStellantis, whose US brands include Chrysler, Jeep, and Ram, as well as European automakers Fiat and Peugeot, told US employees late last month that they would be required to work five days in the office from March 30, Business Insider first reported. Employees outside the US are also set to return to the office full-time, but timing will vary by location.\n\nThe auto conglomerate was an early champion of remote work and introduced policies in 2022 allowing white-collar employees to work from home 70% of the time. Last year, it called staff back into the office at least three days a week.\n\nRival automaker Ford has also tightened its rules on remote work in recent months, calling employees back to the office at least four days a week and warning some they could face termination if they don't comply.\n\nThe crackdown echoes that of the tech industry, with companies like Amazon and Meta enforcing return-to-office requirements in recent years as part of a \"hardcore\" work culture that also emphasizes performance and efficiency.\n\nFilosa's town hall came as the former Jeep head, who was appointed Stellantis CEO in June 2025, battles to turn the company around after years of declining US sales.\n\nStellantis' stock price tumbled as much as 25% on Friday after the company reported a $26 billion charge as it resets its EV strategy amid an industry-wide demand slump.\n\nDo you work at Stellantis or have any information to share?

    "description": "I left Houston to live with my long-distance partner in a rural Canadian town. I worried the change would make me lonely, but I'm happier than ever.",
    "fullText": "Love made me leave behind a place right near my parents in Houston to join my partner in a town without a single restaurant.\n\nI'd first met my partner a decade earlier, but we'd reconnected more recently — while long-distance — over a shared love of stories, coffee, and baseball.\n\nFrom the beginning, it was clear that if we were to close the distance gap, it would be me who moved. I longed for a life closer to nature, away from the crowds, and where I could enjoy each season to the fullest — a life he was already living in rural Canada.\n\nAlthough I did love my life in Houston and my proximity to family, I was ready for a change.\n\nSo, last summer, my brother drove me from Houston to a rural township in central Canada, marking my very last great American road trip. He returned to the nearest major airport, and with him went my last direct link to home.\n\nI thought I'd be lonely and homesick, but my new life keeps me plenty busy, and Zoom calls help me manage the rest.\n\nGone were the days of apartment isolation and cringing at every rare, uninvited knock at the door. Instead, this new life dropped me straight into an established household where friends routinely check on their neighbors.\n\nI'd frequently visited the area before moving, so I knew a few of these folks already. Particular friends of my partner's — Marcie and Dan, a retired couple with two beautiful yellow labs who live just down the street — made me promise to drop by for coffee as soon as I could manage after moving.\n\nMarcie invited me to join her and her friend for bingo at the community center down the road. Not only did Marcie's friend end up winning a small stack of 20s, but the first snow of the season began as we drove.\n\nOn the way home, we commented on the diamond-like quality of the fallen snow in the headlights and made plans to get together again soon.\n\nAdd all of this in-person interaction to my lengthy list of Zoom buddies from home who had no problem joining me for regular virtual catch-ups, and community became no problem.\n\nI joked with my mom that I came out here to be a hermit, and instead found out I'll never have a day alone again.\n\nThere is a profound difference in pace between my old and new lives.\n\nWe haven't had a day without snow on the ground since sometime in November this season. It's not so easy to get out, especially in this weather, so I've found myself leaving the house less often — and spending more time out when I do.\n\nThe world was literally at my fingertips in Houston. A place so big and full of folks from around the world attracts every kind of restaurant, ingredient, and entertainment.\n\nWhy should I stock up my tiny apartment fridge when I could be at a Lebanese place in three minutes, the world's best taco spot in two, and a grocery store with every type of tofu imaginable in 10?\n\nNow, my basement freezer is my grocery store, and my hands set the table at the nearest restaurant: the dining room. With the closest major market over an hour away, I shop for a month at a time and reuse even the scraps of my food.\n\nCooking all of my meals has been a boon to both my wallet and my mental health. Nothing is easy or a given out here, but I've found I don't mind it. The lack of convenience out here is part of the charm.\n\nOne evening, after a daylong errand trip into the nearest sizable city, I climbed out of my car and heard a powerful roar.\n\nMy brain automatically assumed it was traffic from the bridge near my old apartment, years of city-girl conditioning activated. It took me a few seconds to remember that there's no traffic noise here. My partner calls this place the \"edge of Canada\" for a reason.\n\nMy entire body relaxed when I finally understood: The sound I heard was the wind rushing through the trees and kicking up snow.\n\nAll those years living in Houston, I ached for a place closer to nature, a place where I could distance myself from the noise of the city. At long last, here I am.\n\nThis has been the biggest lifestyle shift of my adulthood, and I'm the happiest I've ever been.",

    "title": "Gold bugs are going wild over a call for the metal's price to more than double. Here's what's behind the viral forecast.",
    "description": "A thesis that says financial conditions point to $12,595 for an ounce of gold was making the rounds on social media on Tuesday.",
    "fullText": "A new forecast for gold making the rounds online has stirred the goldbugs into a frenzy.\n\nThe precious metal has rallied to records for much of the last year, bouncing off the lows following its recent historic sell-off to continue pushing higher. Gold was trading around $5,060 per ounce on Tuesday, up 72% in the last 12 months.\n\nAccording to Dan Oliver, the founder of gold and silver mining sector-focused hedge fund Myrmikan Capital, current prices pale in comparison to where they should be if one major source of demand continues to rise.\n\nOliver's thesis centers on gold as a total percentage of central bank reserves.\n\n\"Historically, the market forced central banks to maintain gold reserves of between a third and a half, which would currently imply a price of between $8,395/oz and $12,595/oz,\" he stated in a note published on Monday.\n\nHe argues that gold could actually rise to closer to 100% of reserves in the event of a \"cleansing\" event that drives down the value of other holdings, such as US Treasurys.\n\n\"We don't claim that U.S. Treasuries are worthless, but they are certainly worth less than where the Fed-manipulated market prices them, and the longer-term bonds that the Fed owns are severely impaired, meaning that in a cleansing, gold as a percentage of the balance sheet must trade a lot higher than a third,\" Oliver wrote.\n\nHe argued that gold's rally is being driven by rising stress both in the US debt market and a strained global dollar system. In his view, foreign investors will continue to scale back their reliance on US dollar assets, forcing the Federal Reserve to stabilize the market through large-scale bond buying.\n\n\"This will be the second phase of the gold bull market, a move that has not yet begun, the move to reflect the market realization that the Fed is powerless to save private equity or control interest rates without buying the entire bond market.\"\n\nThe third phase will be a \"government bond death spiral,\" Oliver said.\n\n\"The higher the interest rates rise, the larger the interest payments go, the worse the deficits, the greater the supply of treasuries, and the higher rates will rise.\"\n\nOliver didn't provide a specific timeline for his forecast to unfold, but his analysis was enough to get gold bulls excited on social media.\n\n\"That is the best thing I have read all day, thank you!\" stated one user who describes himself as a 30-year derivatives veteran. Luke Gromen, founder of market research firm Forest for the Trees, cheered the forecast, while Brien Lundin, CEO of the New Orleans Investment Conference, described the post from Oliver as \"fantastic.\"\n\nEveryday traders have also embraced gold as prices have surged, causing some forecasters to compare its yearlong rally to what would be seen in meme stocks rather than precious metals.",

    "fullText": "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told senators on Tuesday that he had lunch on Jeffrey Epstein's private island in 2012. In October, Lutnick was quoted in the New York Post saying he'd decided to cut ties with Epstein in 2005.\n\nLutnick told the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that he had lunch with Epstein on Little Saint James, Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands, during a boat trip with his family.\n\n\"My wife was with me, as were my four children and nannies,\" Lutnick said. \"I had another couple with— they were there as well. with their children.\"\n\nLutnick said the lunch only lasted \"for an hour.\"\n\n\"We were on family vacation,\" Lutnick added. \"To suggest there was anything untoward about that, in 2012, I don't… I don't recall why we did it.\"\n\nThe comments came after Lutnick was asked about recent disclosures from the Department of Justice's ongoing release of the Epstein files, which indicated that the commerce secretary had contact with Epstein after 2008, when the financier pleaded guilty to procuring a minor for prostitution and soliciting a prostitute.\n\nVAN HOLLEN: Did you in fact make the visit to Epstein's private island?\n\nLUTNICK: I did have lunch with him as I was on a boat going across on a family vacation. My wife was with me as were my 4 children and nannies. I had another couple with their children. And we had lunch on… pic.twitter.com/o6GGyNsr5M\n\nThe two had several calls and meetings over drinks scheduled in 2011, the emails show.\n\nEmail exchanges in the files show Lutnick planning to visit the island with his family and friends in December 2012.\n\n\"We are landing in St. Thomas early Saturday afternoon and planning to head over to St. Bart's/Anguilla on Monday at some point,\" Lutnick wrote to Epstein in an email. \"Where are you located (what is exact location for my captain)? Does Sunday evening for dinner sound good?\"\n\nBoth Epstein and Lutnick purchased shares of a now-closed advertising technology company later that month, according to records that were originally reported by CBS News.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Post published in October, Lutnick said that he decided to cut off ties with Epstein in 2005 after visiting his Manhattan home and being shown his massage table. The two men were neighbors at the time.\n\n\"My wife and I decided that I will never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again,\" Lutnick told the Post. \"So I was never in the room with him socially, for business, or even philanthropy. If that guy was there, I wasn't going, 'cause he's gross.\"\n\nA Commerce Department spokesperson said in a statement that \"Mr. and Mrs. Lutnick met Jeffrey Epstein in 2005 and had very limited interactions with him over the next 14 years.\"\n\n\"This is nothing more than a failing attempt by the legacy media to distract from the administration's accomplishments including securing Trillions of dollars in investment, delivering historic trade deals and fighting for the American worker,\" the spokesperson said in an email.\n\nAsked about the testimony later on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Lutnick \"remains a very important member of President Trump's team, and the president fully supports the secretary.\"\n\nLutnick has faced calls to resign from lawmakers on Capitol Hill over the revelations of his association with Epstein.\n\nWhile most of those calls have come from Democrats, Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky has also said Lutnick should go.\n\n\"He should just resign,\" Massie said in a CNN interview.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Monica Aksamit. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I ask people how much they thought I earned as a US Olympian, they always guess an amount far above what I actually got paid.\n\nDuring the years I was part of the US fencing team from 2016 to 2021, I made $300 a month. This was the pinnacle of my fencing career, and yet I wasn't making enough to cover my living expenses.\n\nBut this had always been my dream, and I had to pursue it at all costs.\n\nI'd been fencing since I was about 8. My mom, a Polish immigrant, had signed me up after a client of hers suggested she bring me along to a practice. He said there was a scholarship opportunity if I did well, and my mom was hooked.\n\nFencing was a great outlet for me during my parents' divorce. Most kids get yelled at for hitting other kids — I was being applauded for it.\n\nMy mom financially supported my fencing. She put herself into credit card debt to ensure we could pay for equipment, travel, practices, and tournaments.\n\nI remember her once telling one of my coaches that she couldn't afford to bring me to practices anymore. The coach told her to just pay what she could. He wanted me to chase this dream and saw potential. My road to the Olympics wouldn't have been possible without him.\n\nAs I got a bit older, I started winning competitions, and with that came prize money. My mom's sacrifice, the coach's generosity, and the prize money kept me pushing forward.\n\nAfter watching the 2004 Olympics in Greece, I became fixated on the idea of one day competing on the US Olympic fencing team. It was the first Olympic Games that my event, the women's saber, was added. Nowadays, they're a lot more lenient with adding events — but it wasn't like that then — it was a big deal.\n\nThat year, I sat on my grandparents' couch in Poland and watched, telling them one day, I'd become an Olympian. It was a crazy dream, and that time, my mom didn't necessarily think I'd achieve it, but she kept paving the way for me to get there.\n\nWhen I graduated from college in 2012, my main goal was to get to the Olympics. But now, I was an adult and had to fund it myself.\n\nI alone had to pay for a big portion of the competitions, travel, and all of my own living expenses. I stayed at home because there was no way I could afford to pursue my dream while paying rent.\n\nI worked endlessly as a fencing coach and a referee at tournaments. I handed out flyers for companies and took low-end modelling gigs.\n\nMy fencing club and those who contributed to my GoFundMe continued to financially support me along the way, helping fund my dream.\n\nIn 2016, I qualified for the US Olympic team. Team USA started covering all of my tournaments, training camps, and travel. But I was only given a monthly salary of $300.\n\nThere wasn't any way I could take on another job because what employer was going to let me take several weeks off throughout the year to train and compete?\n\nMy only option was to take out credit cards to fund what I needed to achieve my dream — car insurance, train travel into the city to train, food, bills, and any extras I did. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I didn't want money to be the reason I couldn't achieve what I had worked so long for.\n\nPeople are shocked when I tell them how much I made each month as an Olympian and how I went into debt to represent the US on an international stage.\n\nIt did eventually pay off. I took home a bronze medal at Rio in 2016, but I'm still paying off my credit cards from those years of training and competing with Team USA.\n\nAfter Rio, I put on a fundraiser to cover the costs of getting to Tokyo 2020, and people generously donated enough to go over my goal — it was the only way to fund my Olympic dreams as someone who didn't come from money.",

    "fullText": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff angered some employees by making jokes about Immigration and Customs Enforcement during a company event, according to internal messages viewed by Business Insider.\n\nSalesforce's employee-only \"Company Kickoff\" is happening this week in Las Vegas. The event is also livestreamed internally. Business Insider did not view the livestream.\n\nSalesforce did not immediately reply to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nDozens of Slack messages say that Benioff made \"multiple\" jokes about ICE agents, including about ICE surveilling employee travel.\n\n\"A joke about ICE surveilling employees' travel, when there are literally employees afraid to travel for work due to current situation,\" one employee wrote, according to a screenshot viewed by Business Insider.\n\n\"It's hard to believe this company still has values when you make completely off-base jokes about ICE in your opening keynote,\" another employee wrote. \"That's unacceptable.\"\n\n\"I'm deeply disappointed and uncomfortable that two jokes about ICE were made in the first few minutes of Marc's opening keynote,\" a third employee wrote. \"The fact that the first was made after welcoming our teammates who traveled from outside the US? Even worse. We have many great things to be proud of and stand behind at this company, but these tasteless, insensitive jokes have made it hard to focus on that message. I'm going to have to take a break from watching to regroup.\"\n\nThe comments come after Salesforce earlier this month laid off some employees and appointed new leaders to replace five high-profile leaders who have announced departures since December.\n\nBenioff previously suggested that President Donald Trump should deploy the National Guard to San Francisco ahead of the company's Dreamforce conference. He later apologized.\n\nIt's not the first time Benioff faced backlash from staff for his comments at company meetings.\n\nAfter Salesforce announced plans to cut 10% of its workforce in 2023, Benioff launched into a meandering two-hour talk that some employees characterized as \"tone-deaf.\" He joked at the time about the layoffs ruining one executive's birthday and about being \"thrilled\" about the coronavirus pandemic for allowing him to work from home.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Dress pants are a must-have menswear staple, whether you wear them daily or not. The best pairs for men are timeless in style and comfortable to wear.",
    "fullText": "The best dress pants for men should look clean and sophisticated, whether worn in a business casual setting, on date night, or at a social event. They should also be comfortable and easy to clean. Great dress pants are a critical part of any wardrobe, because even the most stylish dress shirt needs a strong supporting cast.\n\nOur favorite pair is from Mizzen+Main, a menswear brand we love for its comfortable and stretchy office clothes. The Mizzen+Main Helmsman Chino pants are stretchy, lightweight, and breathable, while still looking traditional, which makes them ideal for warmer summer weather. Below, we've rounded up the best dress pants for men, an essential element in any workwear wardrobe.\n\nLightweight takes on a whole new meaning with these airy, four-way stretch pants you've got to try on to believe.\n\nThis versatile pair of chinos features invisible side seams and an elastic waist in dense cotton twill that is wrinkle and dust resistant.\n\nThe Gamechanger Rec Pant is as stretchy and comfortable as your favorite sweatpants, but looks like traditional dress pants.\n\nLightweight takes on a whole new meaning with these airy, four-way stretch pants you've got to try on to believe.\n\nEven the best dress pants can sometimes feel cumbersome in extreme heat, but Mizzen + Main seems to have the right response figured out. Featuring a four-way stretch blend of polyester and spandex that feels light as air and breathes easily, the Helmsman Chinos are incredibly comfortable, while retaining the polished look of a traditional five-pocket chino. They're also designed to resist wrinkles, which is great for staying sharp all day long. All of that, plus the added benefit of many colors available, makes them the best we've tested — especially if you want to fill out your wardrobe for the work week.\n\nThis versatile pair of chinos features invisible side seams and an elastic waist in dense cotton twill that is wrinkle and dust resistant.\n\nUniqlo is known for its stylish staples at affordable prices, and the Slim-Fit Chinos are no different. They feature side-seam detailing, like classic dress pants, plus a relatively tailored slim-straight cut. We also love that Uniqlo offers free alterations if the off-the-rack sizing needs to be tweaked to your liking. While they're not as stretchy or wrinkle-resistant as performance pairs, they're comfortable enough for daily wears, and the price tag makes it easy to buy multiple pairs at once.\n\nThe Gamechanger Rec Pant is as stretchy and comfortable as your favorite sweatpants, but looks like traditional dress pants.\n\nPublic Rec's Gamechanger Rec Pants are designed to be as comfortable as sweatpants, but with specific waist and inseam sizes, they'll fit perfectly like dress pants. The material is incredibly stretchy, which is excellent for mobility, comfort, and resisting wrinkles. If you've been looking for the cheat code to wearing sweatpants to your corporate office, this is it.\n\nRead our full review of the Public Rec Gamechanger Rec Pant.\n\nMade with 100% wool, the Lakeshore pants feature a slim fit with a timeless pinstriped pattern.\n\nWool can sometimes be famously uncomfortable, but The Tie Bar's Lakeshore Pants feature a brushed finish that keeps them soft and comfortable against the skin. The streamlined cut through the hips and thighs keeps the look modern and flattering without being too tight for most men. The striped pattern leans into the classic satorial styling, but leaves room for more casual alternative outfits. If you are going for a fully polished look, you can pair them with The Tie Bar's Lakeshore Jacket for an affordably priced, complete suit.\n\nDress pants remained essentially unchanged for years, often made of classic wool, until  Ministry of Supply came along and changed the game. They've quite literally engineered a new way to think about dress pants, using wrinkle-resistant, 4-way stretch fabric boasting next-level features like natural odor control. Yet, they still feature timeless dress pant details like front slash pockets and two clean, sharp fit options. They should be comfortable enough for all-day wear and even business travel.\n\nRead more about the Ministry of Supply in our review of the best work clothes for men,\n\nSome dress pants separate themselves from the pack with a super-crisp design. In fact, it's hard not to love sharp, dressy, creased-front pants. The BOSS brand and its subsets, like the Genius line, specialize in these. Wool fabric is elevated even further with a comfortable stretch, turning these into comfortable pants fit for day-to-night wear.\n\nIndochino is known for its custom, made-to-measure menswear. You've got the world of premium tailored style at your fingertips, so to speak, with customizable options from Indochino. It's easier and more efficient than ever to add a little flair to your rotation of the best dress pants for men, with customizable fabric and lining options available. And seeing as these pants already come in Indochino's excellent cashmere blend, you're already starting at a proper jumping-off point.\n\nThe Apparel Skyline Pants are an eye-catching take on classic men's dress pants.\n\nY.Chroma Apparel is all about reimagining what you thought you knew about menswear. The brand is bold and vibrant, taking cues from surf and skate culture yet putting a refined spin on those typically youthful pursuits. That approach manifests itself in the visually appealing Skyline Pants, which are classic enough to wear with chunky leather loafers and edgy enough to wear with beat-up dress boots. They're stitched in Bulgaria from a blend of cotton and Italian elastane, and Y.Chroma's color selection is simply immaculate.\n\nSqueezing into suit pants or finding dress pants that fit was once a chore for guys with larger thighs and a more athletic build. And yet, State and Liberty was founded with a laser-sharp focus on solving that problem, from blazers to dress shirts and these expertly cut dress pants. The performance-blend fabric moves with you and offers a tapered fit with plenty of room (but not too much), while these can easily be paired with a State and Liberty blazer for a cool, tailored look.\n\nIs it possible for a pair of the best dress pants to actually be, well — more casual? In the hands of Mugsy, the answer is a resounding yes. The brand's thin wale stretch corduroy boasts the eye-catching texture of corduroy, but the lightweight stretch fabric makes them a reliable option for chilly fall and winter days, too. Plus, the five-pocket design and washed-out colorway are both slightly more laidback if you prefer a pair of dress pants with a (slightly) more easygoing look.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

After Anthropic rolled out new tools for its Cowork agent aimed at professionals in the legal space, the entire sector sold off as investors eyed the potential for wider disruption.\n\nOther brokerage stocks, such as Interactive Brokers and Morgan Stanley, fared slightly better on Tuesday. The fact that both firms cater to institutional traders implies that Wall Street is more concerned about retail-facing brokerage stocks.\n\nCompanies in the accounting space, such as QuickBooks owner Intuit, fell about 3%. Accounting software makers SAP SE and Xero rose 1% and 2% respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI approved the integration of an AI application on ChatGPT to enable users to receive direct insurance quotes on the platform.\n\nNeither platform directly offers users the ability to trade stocks, but for the market, the key concern is that AI disruption is poised to upend the financial sector, as it did the legal technology field last week.\n\nMarkets have largely recovered from the tech plunge last week, with multiple analysts saying this week that the event represents a buy-the-dip moment.

    "fullText": "I grew up watching the Food Network and always loved Ina Garten for her laid-back attitude and approach to cooking. When I was a 20-something in New York City, I relied on her recipes to transport me to other destinations without ever leaving my apartment.\n\nFor example, I found her roasted shrimp and orzo recipe nearly 20 years ago and have been making it ever since. These days, it's a go-to for feeding my family of four a quick, nutritious, and delicious meal.\n\nI love its simplicity, fresh flavors, and the fact that it's always a crowd-pleaser. Here's how I make it.\n\nTo make Garten's roasted shrimp and orzo recipe, which serves six, I grabbed:\n\nAfter gathering my ingredients, I realized I forgot to buy a lemon, so I substituted it with white-wine vinegar.\n\nI used frozen shrimp for convenience, and let them defrost in the fridge for a few hours before cooking. Once I took them out, I patted them dry and tossed them in olive oil, salt, and pepper.\n\nI spread them out on a pan with foil and roasted them in my toaster oven at 400 degrees Fahrenheit. The recipe says to do this for six minutes, but I did it just a little bit longer.\n\nI cooked the orzo according to the package directions, drained it, and sprayed it lightly with olive oil to prevent it from sticking together.\n\nWhile that was cooking, I chopped the red onion, cucumber, parsley, dill, and green onion.\n\nTo make this super simple dressing, I mixed white wine vinegar, olive oil, salt, and pepper together.\n\nI piled the orzo, shrimp, veggies, feta, and herbs on top of the dressing and tossed them all together.\n\nI often make this recipe the day I eat it, and it tastes amazing when it's warm and freshly mixed. However, it's also fantastic once the flavors have had a little while to marinate, so sometimes, I let it sit in the fridge overnight.\n\nOne of my favorite things about this recipe is that it can easily be modified. As a mom, I've changed the recipe up to suit the tastes of my toddler and preschooler.\n\nFor example, if I want them to eat more veggies, I'll toss in whatever I have on hand — like red peppers or tomatoes.\n\nAnd, I usually pile a scoop of this over spinach or arugula for myself, for an easy boost of greens.\n\nOverall, this recipe is such a solid base to work from — and one of the easiest ways to get a filling, nutritious weeknight meal on the table that my kids will enjoy.\n\nThis story was originally published on October 7, 2025, and most recently updated on February 10, 2026.",

    "fullText": "Mark Zuckerberg is one of the world's richest people, and his multimillion-dollar real estate portfolio reflects that.\n\nThe man responsible for Facebook is worth an estimated $231 billion, Forbes reported, and part of that fortune includes assets like a sprawling California compound and acres of lush land on a Hawaiian island.\n\nZuckerberg's real estate dealings are often shrouded in privacy, including the use of limited-liability companies and addresses linked to the investment management firm Iconiq Capital.\n\nHis most recent real estate deal, as reported by The Wall Street Journal, is a mansion on Indian Creek, an exclusive South Florida island that's home to other tech titans like Jeff Bezos. Representatives for Zuckerberg at Meta declined to comment to Business Insider.\n\nOver the years, Zuckerberg has bought and sold homes all over the country. He's also reportedly built some — a Hawaiian doomsday ranch that has had many scratching their heads, for example.\n\nHere's what we know about his real estate portfolio.\n\nIt's no surprise that a tech titan has more than one property in Silicon Valley. The Meta CEO owns five homes in the Crescent Park neighborhood of Palo Alto.\n\nHe gave viewers a rare peek inside one of them in 2016; the house is even tricked out with a \"custom-made artificially intelligent assistant,\" according to CNBC. The home is only a 10-minute drive from the Meta HQ in Menlo Park.\n\nArchitectural Digest described it as a \"'no frills abode\" that chooses function over extravagance. Zuckerberg then spent over $43 million on the four homes surrounding his original residence in Crescent Park, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe four-bedroom, four-bathroom home is located near San Francisco's Dolores Park. He and his wife, Priscilla Chan, reportedly spent $10 million to purchase the townhouse in 2010.\n\nAt the time of the sale in 2022, it was the largest residential real estate deal in the city.\n\nLake Tahoe is a popular vacation destination for wealthy Californians in both summer and winter, and Zuckerberg and his family are no exception.\n\nThe tax records of the two properties — known as Carousel Estate and Brushwood Estate — display the same address as tax records of other properties linked to Zuckerberg, according to documents viewed by BI.\n\nAt 5,322 square feet, the Brushwood Estate features six bedrooms, five baths, and two half baths, according to SF Gate. Inside are high-beamed ceilings and picture windows; outside are lush trees, a private dock, and a hot tub. There's also a 2,293-square-foot guesthouse.\n\nIt's unclear exactly how many acres of land Zuckerberg currently owns on Kauai, but he began buying up a region of the island back in 2014.\n\nBusiness Insider tracked down at least 1,200 acres between 17 parcels of land that have the same tax address as other properties mentioned above, but are owned by LLCs including Kahu'aina Holdings LLC and Pila'a International LLC.\n\nThe 1,200 acres include about 750 acres he reportedly paid $100 million in 2014 for. That encompasses a more than 350-acre span of land on Pila'a Beach.\n\nAnother part of Zuckerberg's Hawaii holdings is the nearly 600 acres of land on Kauai's North Shore that reportedly cost him around $53 million in 2021.\n\nOn one of his Hawaiian parcels, Zuckerberg is reportedly building a huge compound that's said to include a 5,000-square-foot underground bunker with an escape hatch. It's been dubbed Koolau Ranch, and Wired reported that buying the land and creating the compound cost the executive an estimated $270 million.\n\nAs Silicon Valley continues to infiltrate Washington, DC, Zuckerberg established a residence in the US capital, Politico said. The home that's reportedly his new pad is situated in Massachusetts Avenue Heights, not far from the Naval Observatory and the Washington National Cathedral, according to Builder magazine.\n\nZuckerberg kept the purchase private, Politico said. The mansion in question was sold for $23 million in cash. It was designed by local firm Robert Gurney Architect and sits on about one acre of property.\n\nBusiness Insider was unable to independently confirm that Zuckerberg purchased the property.\n\nMark Zuckerberg is reportedly adding a second East Coast property to his portfolio after buying a home in Miami, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nZuckerberg is purchasing a waterfront mansion on Indian Creek, an exclusive island in South Florida that's home to Jeff Bezos, Carl Icahn, and Jared Kushner.\n\nThe sold home previously belonged to a limited liability company linked to Peter Cancro, the founder of Jersey Mike's Subs. The property — which was just a home lot — was last traded for $37 million in 2021, Miami-Dade property records show.\n\nIt's unclear how much this off-market deal was worth, but an empty lot next door to Bezos sold for $105 million in 2025.\n\nHillary Hoffower contributed to an earlier version of this story.",

    "description": "The CIO at the Haverford Trust says dividend stocks are better choices than commodities. Here are two options for investors.",
    "fullText": "Precious metals have long been seen as a safe haven during any market uncertainty. And as the stock market flashes the occasional warning sign of stress, these commodities have been big winners over the last year. Gold prices are up 77% over the last 12 months, and the price of silver has done even better, rising 153%.\n\nBut it’s also noteworthy that both gold and silver stumbled lately. Gold dropped nearly 13% from its late January high before making a mild recovery; silver tumbled 31% from its high of $114 and is now drifting at $80.\n\nAs Crypto Collapses, Buy This 1 Trillion-Dollar Dividend Stock Instead\n\nForget High Yield: This Dividend King Is up Nearly 900%\n\n1 High-Yield Dividend Stock That’s Up 148% Over the Past Year\n\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. \n\nThat’s why a warning from Hank Smith, the CIO of Haverford Trust, is getting attention these days.  He warns that investors should be cautious about putting money into gold, silver, or any commodity. He says the run higher in 2025 and early this year is more fueled by momentum instead of substance, and investors should instead consider stocks that offer yield, such as dividend stocks.\n\n\"Those (commodities) are speculations. They're not investments,\" he told Business Insider. “Because physical commodities do not have earnings, they don't have an income statement, a balance sheet, they don't pay dividends or interest—you’re buying that with the expectation that someone's going to come along and buy at a higher price. That's the only way you're going to make money.”\n\nSmith has a point—investors should never, ever consider putting all their investments into a single class such as commodities. And while I believe that gold, silver, and even cryptocurrency have a place in a well-diversified portfolio, I agree that investors should have the bulk of their investments in the stock market, looking for yield.\n\nHere are two ways to capitalize on that strategy through exchange-traded funds. Each has a different strategy but is geared toward providing yield through proven strategies.\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) is one of the most popular dividend ETFs on the market, with $78.5 billion in net assets and trading volume of nearly 20 million shares per day.\n\nThe fund tracks the total return of the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, which includes U.S.-based dividend-paying stocks. The fund focuses on large-cap value stocks that provide stable returns and dividend growth—ideal for any investor seeking consistent yield.",

    "fullText": "Despite a “ceasefire,” Israel’s killing has not ended. Neither has the determination of the Palestinian people to survive.\n\nGaza has been suspended in a bloody limbo for months. The so-called ceasefire with Israel has not brought peace. The bombings and demolitions persist, and Israel’s expanding occupation continues unabated. Since October 10, 2025, when the ceasefire was declared, more than 440 people have been killed and more than 2,500 buildings destroyed. Israel has only allowed a fraction of the essential equipment needed for cooking, heating, and construction to enter the Strip. Gaza is now buried beneath 680 million tons of rubble. Ninety percent of the population has been displaced, many of them several times. Hundreds of thousands live in threadbare tents.\n\nThe “ceasefire” is meant to breed apathy among us; the spectacle of modern genocidal warfare has been replaced by the slow bureaucratic proceedings of ethnic cleansing. Washington’s hollow promises to bring “technocratic governance” to Gaza mask a colonial project imposed on a people with no say: a people left to die, forgotten by the world.\n\nThis, then, is where we return. In early February, The Nation gave over its website for a day to writers from Gaza. We did this to make it clear that we will remain focused on Gaza and the Palestinian people. No diplomatic proceedings or political distortions will subdue our demand for their right to self-determination—or their right to speak for themselves.\n\nThe pieces in this series are an affirmation of that right: a record of Gaza’s refusal, in the face of the world’s neglect, to be exterminated.\n\n—Rayan El Amine, Lizzy Ratner, and Jack Mirkinson\n\nRayan El Amine, Jack Mirkinson, Lizzy Ratner\n\nToday, The Nation is turning over its website exclusively to stories from Gaza and its people. This is why.\n\nThe language of ceasefire has been repurposed in Gaza: It no longer describes a pause in violence but rather a mechanism for managing it.\n\nWhat I saw walking one block in Gaza.\n\nRecording what has been erased—and making sense of what remains.\n\nJournalists in Gaza have bartered their lives to tell a truth that much of the world still doesn’t want to hear.\n\nOn Palestine and the geography of vanishing.\n\nRewaa was killed by an Israeli bomb. Her absence has broken me in ways I still cannot describe.\n\nThese pictures are records of a genocidal war, but they are something more, too—they are fragments of Gaza itself.\n\nFaced with endlessly narrowing possibilities, I return to my diary in an attempt to dream, to imagine a future.\n\nAfter their home was obliterated, Rasha Abou Jalal and her family remain determined to build a new one, even if it must be built out of nothing.\n\nHamada Abu Layla spent 22 years gathering three university degrees. Now they mock him from a garbage dump.\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "description": "Ilia Malinin, known as the \"Quad God,\" is one of Team USA's breakout figure skating stars of the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics.",
    "fullText": "You may recognize US figure skater Ilia Malinin from his gravity-defying backflips and quadruple jumps.\n\nOr perhaps you know him simply as the \"Quad God.\"\n\nMalinin, 21, is a two-time world champion and one of Team USA's breakout figure skating stars of the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics.\n\nHere's what to know about Malinin's background and Olympic career.\n\nMalinin's parents, Tatiana Malinina and Roman Skorniakov, were born in Russia and represented Uzbekistan at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano and the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City.\n\nNow, they serve as his coaches.\n\nMalinin was born in Fairfax, Virginia, and began figure skating at 7 years old.\n\nMalinin's younger sister, Ellie \"Liza\" Beatrice Malinina, is also a competitive figure skater.\n\nHe trains in Reston, Virginia. When he's not figure skating, he's a student at the nearby George Mason University majoring in exploratory studies.\n\nMalinin is the first and only skater to ever land a quadruple axel in competition, and began using the nickname \"Quad God\" when he was 13 years old.\n\nMalinin helped Team USA secure the gold medal in the team figure skating competition on Sunday. He landed five quadruple jumps in his free skate, but has yet to attempt a quadruple axel at the 2026 Olympics. While he had planned to execute a quadruple axel during the Team Event, he substituted a triple axel instead.\n\nMalinin has also included backflips in his Olympic routines — a feat with a complicated history.\n\nDuring the 1976 Olympics, American figure skater Terry Kubicka performed the first-ever backflip, but the International Skating Union banned the move shortly thereafter in 1977, saying it was too dangerous.\n\nIn 1998, French figure skater Surya Bonaly became the first Olympic figure skater to land a backflip on one blade during her free skate, but was penalized by the judges since the move was still illegal in competition.\n\nThe International Skating Union lifted the ban on backflips in 2024. During the Team Event this year, Malinin landed a backflip on one skate just as Bonaly had, but this time, it was permitted.\n\nMalinin is believed to be the highest-paid figure skater at the 2026 Olympics with an estimated income of $700,000 from sponsorships over the last year, Forbes reported.\n\nAccording to Malinin's website, his corporate partners include Coca-Cola, Samsung, Google, Xfinity, Dick's Sporting Goods, and Honda.\n\nHaving already won gold in the team competition, Malinin will skate in the individual Men's Short Program on February 10 and the individual Men's Free Skate on February 13.\n\nSee Business Insider's full guide to watching Olympic figure skating",

    "fullText": "Boston Dynamics' Robert Playter is stepping down as CEO after six years in the role and more than 30 years with the company, according to a staff memo he sent to employees on Tuesday.\n\nPlayter's last day will be February 27, the memo said. Amanda McMaster, Boston Dynamics' chief financial officer, will serve as interim CEO, while the company board searches for its next chief executive, Playter wrote.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Boston Dynamics said Playter had guided the company from its early days of \"hopping robots\" to Spot, the quadruped robot.\n\n\"He transformed Boston Dynamics from a small research and development lab into a successful business that now proudly calls itself the global leader in mobile robotics,\" the company said in the statement. \"He will be sorely missed, but we hope he enjoys some well-deserved time off. Thanks, Rob.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Boston Dynamics said Playter will not play any advisory role and will be spending time off with his friends and family.\n\nPlayter's retirement comes on the heels of Boston Dynamics' unveiling of Atlas, a six-foot-tall humanoid robot, and in the midst of a global humanoid robot race.\n\nAtlas has been advertised as the factory worker of the future. Hyundai, which owns a majority stake in Boston Dynamics, said it expected the robot to hit the factory floor by 2028, starting with simpler tasks.\n\n\"We've been doing this for a long time. But for us to be approaching a point where we're really thinking about commercializing the humanoid, I don't know that we expected that years ago,\" Playter told Business Insider at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.\n\nPlayter first joined Boston Dynamics in 1994, shortly after pursuing a Ph.D. in aerospace engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nDuring his tenure, Playter saw the robotics startup change multiple hands. The company was first acquired by Google, then SoftBank, and most recently by Hyundai Motor Group.\n\nPlayter told Business Insider he was overseeing a team of nearly 1,100 people.\n\nRead the memo Playter sent to staff on Tuesday:",

    "fullText": "While Indiana officials play up their efforts to lure the Chicago Bears across the border for a new stadium, Gov. JB Pritzker said Monday that he and his staff have made “progress” to incentivize the football team to stay in Illinois.\n\nThe governor’s comments come as Pritzker’s January calendar shows he had two scheduled conversations with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell while Goodell was in Chicago for the Bears-Packers playoff game on Jan. 10.\n\nDuring his time here for the game, Goodell joined Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren and Chair George McCaskey on a tour of the Arlington Heights site the team owns, and sites in northwest Indiana, including one near Wolf Lake in Hammond.\n\nThe first conversation between the governor and Goodell was a scheduled half-hour phone call on Jan. 9, while the second was a half-hour discussion between the two on Jan. 12, according to the governor’s calendar entries. The governor’s office on Monday declined to comment on how the conversations went or what was said.\n\nBut the scheduled talks underscore that efforts surrounding the Bears stadium have not gone dormant, even though the team said in December it was exploring a move to northwest Indiana after negotiations with Pritzker and his Democratic allies in the Illinois General Assembly hit a lull.\n\nThe key sticking points in Illinois have been over how the state would legislatively or financially aid the team in its desire to build a stadium in Chicago’s northwest suburbs. In particular, topics have evolved around assistance for infrastructure around a proposed Arlington Heights stadium, property tax certainty for the team and payment of debt for the Soldier Field renovations done more than 20 years ago at the team’s behest.\n\nSources familiar with the discussions between the Bears and state of Illinois officials said both sides have been meeting regularly since early December to hammer out legislation for this spring’s legislative session in Springfield. The talks have been in line with public infrastructure improvements for or around the Bears stadium site in Arlington Heights and so-called megaprojects legislation that would make it easier for the Bears to negotiate with local governments over property taxes, sources said. In addition, the governor’s office has sought for the Bears to implement measures to make games more affordable, the sources said.\n\nSince the Bears’ December announcement that opened the door to a stadium across the border, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun has said his administration was “working hard” to attract the Bears and has pushed a bill to establish a state authority to “acquire, construct, equip, own, lease, and finance” a sports stadium.\n\nBut on Monday, Pritzker, during an unrelated news conference in southwest Illinois, cast an optimistic tone when he described Illinois officials’ relationship with the Bears these days.\n\n“There’s a lot of discussion, a lot of ongoing conversation with the Bears, and indeed, frankly, progress that’s been made. So I’m pleased about that,” he said in Belleville, where he and other lawmakers talked about a bond program meant to spur economic development in Illinois communities. “But I’m going to let the Bears talk about what it is that they want to get done and how they want to get it done. And I’m obviously involved in negotiations and so are my entire team, as well as the members of the legislature.”\n\nThe Tribune reported that in late December, Pritzker’s office signed a new $25,000 contract with an outside attorney to continue advising the administration in negotiations with the Bears through the end of June.\n\nPritzker on Monday also reiterated his position on the Bears’ quest for state incentives that he does not want taxpayer money paying for the stadium itself but would be willing to use state money to help the team with infrastructure funding, which generally includes improvements to roads and other transportation-related initiatives.\n\n“We are helping businesses build infrastructure, for example, which they would need, and other things that are sort of available, again, to any business that is growing or building something new in the state of Illinois that’s putting people to work,” the governor said. “You know, those are normal incentives, and that’s what I would expect that we will end up with the Bears, you know, depending on where it goes.”\n\nA team consultant estimated last year that infrastructure improvements from near Illinois Route 53 and changes to a nearby Metra train line could cost more than $850 million in public funds. What’s more, the Bears would likely need megaproject legislation that would allow them to negotiate with local governments over property tax bills.\n\nAnother issue for Bears officials is more than $500 million in outstanding public debt from the controversial 2003 Soldier Field renovation, a tab currently covered by city hotel taxes and, when that falls short, by Chicago’s share of state income taxes. The Bears’ lease at Soldier Field expires in 2033, but it can be broken early with a penalty, and the team says it will take three years to build its new stadium.\n\nBut even with the debt paid off, that alone might not be enough to satisfy state lawmakers who represent swaths of Chicago and are reluctant to incentivize the team to move out of the city limits, even if it’s to Arlington Heights.\n\nIn Springfield a few weeks ago, Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch, a Democrat from Hillside, sent out a survey to other House Democrats about where they stand on the Bears issue. The results of that survey were not available.\n\nAs for whether he’s taking the Bears’ interest in relocating to Indiana seriously, Pritzker said Monday, “I never take anything as if it’s a bluff.”\n\n“I mean, I’m always concerned about making sure that we’re attracting businesses or keeping businesses in the state of Illinois,” he said. “So we’re in consistent conversation with the Chicago Bears — have been, by the way, for, I don’t know, a year and a half or two years. And specifically, I think there’s a real possibility that many of the things that we put on the table to work with the Bears on are things that they’re willing to do to stay in the state of Illinois.”",

Its guidance for the first quarter also missed the mark as it said it expects adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, a measure of profit, of between $120 million and $140 million.\n\nThe company also reported a surprise operating loss of $188.4 million for 2025.\n\nLyft saw an \"unexpected\" increase in competitors' price promotions that weighed on its quarterly results, CEO David Risher said on an earnings call.\n\n\"During a season of heightened competitive promotions, we prioritized the most durable, profitable demand in the marketplace,\" the company said in commentary released with its results.\n\nThe results complicate Lyft's turnaround story. Since Risher became CEO in 2023, Lyft has cut costs and introduced new products for riders, including a price-lock feature for commuters. Lyft's stock is up about 11% over the past year.\n\nOn Tuesday's earnings call, Risher pointed to Lyft's growth plans for 2026 and beyond, including adding Black car rides and a service specifically for teens — both options that rival Uber already offers.\n\nRisher also pointed to robotaxis as an area of expansion. Lyft is working with Waymo to bring self-driving cars to its ride-hailing app in Nashville later this year.\n\nStill, the company faces challenges in the autonomous vehicle market. Asked by an analyst why Lyft hasn't struck deals with more robotaxi providers, Risher said: \"There just aren't that many suppliers\" that can function at the scale Lyft needs.\n\nRisher said he expects robotaxi availability to change over the next few years. \"We see a lot of supply coming online\" by 2030, he said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Moderate House Republicans worried about this year’s midterm elections appear ready to finally break with President Donald Trump over his signature economic policy.\n\nIn a bid to protect Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson has repeatedly introduced procedural rules banning members from bringing up resolutions challenging the president’s crushing tariffs on products from dozens of U.S. trading partners.\n\nOn Tuesday, Johnson planned to ask the House to extend the ban through August. But this time, key Republicans signaled they would likely vote against the measure, Punchbowl reported.\n\n“American consumers pay the tariffs and thus it is a big tax,” Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska told the outlet. “I support giving these authorities back to Congress.”\n\nRep. Kevin Kiley of California also told Punchbowl that he had “made it clear” he was not in favor of extending the blockade.\n\nWith full attendance, two Republican defectors would be enough to sink Johnson’s proposed extension, opening the door to a flood of Democratic resolutions challenging the increasingly unpopular tariffs.\n\nThe vote is likely to be close, as some Republicans are still holding out hope the Supreme Court will strike down the tariffs, easing voters’ concerns while sparing them a confrontation with the president, according to Punchbowl.\n\nThe duties are a form of import tax paid by American companies, which must either eat the additional costs or pass them along to consumers.\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed the bulk of the costs fall on foreign producers and middlemen, when in fact Americans “pay one way or the other—via higher prices or less choice,” the opinion editors of the Rupert Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal wrote last week.\n\nTrump trade adviser Peter Navarro acknowledged in December that U.S. manufacturing was down thanks to the tariffs, which have also contributed to higher prices and led to intense trade volatility.\n\nTariffs were also at the center of an international scandal last month after the president threatened to impose duties on products from countries that opposed his efforts to seize Greenland, an autonomous region of a fellow NATO country, Denmark.\n\nHe ultimately dropped the threat after NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte talked him down during a meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nIf Johnson’s procedural vote fails, Democrats are likely to force votes as early as this week on resolutions to overturn Trump’s tariffs on products from Mexico and Canada, followed by resolutions aimed at tariffs on Brazilian products and products from other global trade partners.\n\nThe Canada vote in particular would be a difficult one for Republicans and would require the White House’s intervention, Johnson told Puck.\n\nWhile Trump could ultimately veto any resolution reining in his trade wars, a rebuke from Congress would nevertheless be politically damaging.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "description": "Dorothy...",
    "fullText": "In a new memoir, author Dorothy Roberts explores why interracial attraction can’t be disentangled from the larger forces of race, gender, and power that govern our world.\n\nI grew up in Chicago believing the book on interracial marriage my father, a white anthropologist, worked on throughout my childhood sprang from his love for my Black Jamaican mother. But when I finally opened the boxes of papers I had inherited, I discovered he had begun interviewing Black-white couples as a 21-year-old graduate student in the 1930s, long before he met her. In notes from his bachelor-era interviews in the 1950s, he described a wild party for mixed-race couples only. Reading these papers left me uneasy about desire that’s racialized—when race itself becomes the attraction.\n\nI can picture clearly the first time I was unsettled by this type of attraction. The moment plays back like a haunting scene from a movie.\n\nIt is the month before my eighth-grade graduation from my integrated school in Kenwood, as the chilly Chicago spring slowly warms into summer. I am barely thirteen years old. During recess or when school lets out, I notice two white girls in my grade leaning casually against the school wall as Black boys bend toward each one, playfully chatting.\n\nThe girls pose with an unaccustomed demeanor as they look up at the boys, seeming to hold their attention effortlessly. They are dressed in miniskirts that had become shorter than the year before, knee-high socks, and fitted blouses. I can tell they fancy themselves more mature than our classmates for talking with the boys in this manner. In hindsight, I suspect that the boys were students at the high school, who crossed the park separating our schools for a chance to share this momentary exchange.\n\nThat was my first awareness of the dynamic of white girls and Black boys expressing a distinctive attraction toward each other. The sight of those boys and girls interacting was unlike anything I had seen or experienced before. It felt unfamiliar, a sharp contrast to the behavior I was used to from my classmates.\n\nIn my little autograph book, with a blue cover and multicolored pages, where my classmates wrote playful farewells as we departed for high school, a common inscription from the girls was “2 cool 2 go 4 boys,” a phrase that hinted at a collective innocence—or perhaps a shared resistance to interest in romance. In that moment, I sensed that those white girls and Black boys had crossed a line. And I knew race played a part in what I was seeing.\n\nAt that point, the closest I’d gotten to flirting was a phone call from one of the Black boys in my class. He told me he liked me and asked me “to go with” him. Maybe if I had agreed, I might have been one of the girls with her back against the wall, with him smiling down at me that day. But even a second phone call was out of the question. My mother wouldn’t allow it.\n\nMaybe those white girls were the only ones who were willing, not the only ones who were desired. The Black southern writer Kiese Laymon explains in his memoir, Heavy, that the reason the first girl he had sex with was white—even though he was attracted to a Black girl—was because the white girl was the first to ask him. In any case, the dynamic surely would have been radically different if I, a Black girl, were in the scene.\n\nQuestions swirled in my mind. Did their flirting extend beyond the schoolyard? I wondered. Was there more to it than the playfulness I was witnessing? My mother had worked hard to shield me from any sexual experience of my own, but I could still detect the charged energy emanating from the scene. I felt a knot form in my stomach. My face burned with intense and confusing emotions I couldn’t fully articulate at the time. I resented the girls for the power they held over the boys. I felt disgusted with the boys for being captivated by it. I felt betrayed by all of them.\n\nI never felt similarly offended by my parents’ relationship, however. Daddy frequently praised my mother’s beauty while I was growing up. He admired my mother’s many dazzling traits, her intelligence and grace, along with her appearance, and he made a habit of saying so.\n\nLooking back on his attraction to her, I can see that it stemmed at least in part from her African features. As if to leave no doubt, Daddy was fond of repeating the saying “The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice.” I understood perfectly when I was little that he meant that he found Mommy’s dark skin—and the charms that went along with it—appealing. I also knew he meant the saying as a rebuke of the white-beauty standard, the dominant societal preference for light skin.\n\nFar from hearing anything unseemly in my father’s words, I was grateful for his adoration of my mother’s Blackness. At the time, I had no idea that he had pursued Black women long before he met my mother. Still, knowing that now doesn’t tarnish my view of their relationship. (Even if that means I am judging my classmates in my recurring memory more harshly than I am my parents.)\n\nStatistics bear out the strong influence race has on intimate relationships. The most obvious impact is that people in the United States tend to marry within their own race.\n\nThe US Supreme Court struck down bans on interracial marriage in 1967, but no law regulates personal preferences when choosing a partner. While interracial marriages have steadily increased in recent decades—along with popular approval—they remain relatively uncommon.\n\nAs my father noted in his 1940 master’s thesis, mixed-race marriages are far less frequent than we would expect if couples were randomly matched without regard to race. According to a 2008 study, if pairings were random, 44 percent of all US marriages would be interracial. In reality, that number is just about 20 percent—a clear sign that race continues to shape marital choices.\n\nFor me, interracial intimacy can’t be disentangled from the larger forces of race, gender, and power that continue to govern our world.\n\nBooks & the Arts\n\n /\n\n Benjamin Kunkel\n\nSoon after I opened my father’s boxes for the first time, I was introduced to the unsettling world of digital dating research by my sociology PhD student, Sarah Adeyinka-Skold. Her work explores how young women from different racial backgrounds navigate the search for long-term romantic partners. Based on dating app data and interviews with 111 Asian, Black, Latina, and white college-educated women, Sarah found that Black women face the greatest number of barriers in the modern dating landscape.\n\nMost online dating platforms allow users to set racial preferences, including filtering potential matches by race, and the patterns that emerge are striking. While most users, to varying degrees, show a preference to date within their own racial group, what’s more telling is who they won’t even consider.\n\nBlack users are 10 times more likely to message white users than the reverse. In fact, 80 percent of white users send messages exclusively to other white users, and only 3 percent reach out to Black users. One man, reflecting on these dynamics, described the trend as sexual racism masked as preference. He recalled sending a photo on a dating app and receiving a blunt reply: “I don’t like black guys, sorry.”\n\nConversely, whiteness—or even partial European ancestry—provides a noticeable advantage in the dating market. While white people are the least likely to date outside their racial group, non-white people are most likely to choose white people as the group they would date interracially.\n\nOne finding from the dating app data that Sarah shared with me was especially infuriating: Black women are the only group of women frequently excluded as potential dating partners by men of their own race. To put it bluntly, some Black men reject Black women categorically—simply because they are Black.\n\nThe history of sexual violation of Black women and lynching of Black men casts a long shadow over the politics of interracial intimacy. It makes Black women’s relationships with white men seem as if the women are capitulating to a white supremacist and patriarchal hierarchy, while Black men’s relationships with white women are countering it. But I can also see the opposite. Those exceptional white men who love, admire, and commit to Black women are nothing like exploitative enslavers—and the Black women who love them in return aren’t victims of exploitation. By contrast, those Black men who see having romantic relationships with white women as a badge of liberation, a prize that no Black woman can offer, do nothing to oppose the racial hierarchy. In these admittedly skewed scenarios, the white men are contesting white supremacist disparagement of Black women, whereas the Black men are playing into it.\n\nI can’t deny my bias—both as a Black woman and as the daughter of a Black woman who married a white man, my father. Yet, what matters most to me is my fierce loyalty to Black women and my opposition to the stereotypes, policies, dating apps, jokes, social media, TV shows, and movies that demean us. Few things ignite my anger more than the notion that Black women are inherently less attractive, less capable, less nurturing, or less valuable. Everything I have written and worked toward as an adult has been dedicated to celebrating and uplifting Black women’s sexuality, childbearing, and motherhood.\n\nI wish I could believe that sexual attraction, desire, and love exist untouched by race. Romantic attraction is supposed to be a magical force, something beyond our control that transcends the influence of society. “Why can’t you just be happy for people who love each other?” my husband often insists when I bring up the sociological dimensions of interracial intimacy. “Why does everything have to be political?”\n\nI would never discuss these thoughts at the interracial weddings of friends and family—I respect those moments and their marital decisions as deeply personal. I try not to make this about individual choices. But I can’t ignore what I’ve spent years studying: the undeniable ways unequal structures shape our preferences, even the most intimate ones.",

    "description": "Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she opposes President Trump's SAVE Act, an election bill requiring proof of citizenship to vote nationwide, saying states run elections.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska on Tuesday became the first Republican senator to speak out against the SAVE Act, a sweeping election bill backed by President Donald Trump that would require proof of citizenship to vote nationwide.\n\nIn doing so, she reminded her colleagues that they roundly claimed to oppose new federal election laws as recently as Joe Biden’s presidency.\n\n“When Democrats attempted to advance sweeping election reform legislation in 2021, Republicans were unanimous in opposition because it would have federalized elections, something we have long opposed,” Murkowski said in a statement. “Now, I’m seeing proposals such as the SAVE Act and MEGA that would effectively do just that. Once again, I do not support these efforts.”\n\n“Not only does the U.S. Constitution clearly provide states the authority to regulate the ‘times, places, and manner’ of holding federal elections, but one-size-fits-all mandates from Washington, D.C., seldom work in places like Alaska,” she added.\n\nUnder current law, all U.S. voters must attest under oath that they are citizens, with criminal penalties for lying. Beyond that, states can set their own rules.\n\nThe SAVE Act would bar states from registering people to vote unless they provide documents or evidence proving U.S. citizenship. It would also require all Americans to present ID when they go to vote.\n\nThe legislation, introduced by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, has 48 GOP co-sponsors, and Trump has repeatedly called on Congress to pass it in recent days. Even if it gains a majority of the Senate, it is subject to the 60-vote threshold, and Democrats have vowed to block it.\n\nWhile Trump and other SAVE Act backers say it’s designed to protect election integrity, Murkowski said it would do the opposite.\n\n“Election Day is fast approaching. Imposing new federal requirements now, when states are deep into their preparations, would negatively impact election integrity by forcing election officials to scramble to adhere to new policies likely without the necessary resources,” she said. “Ensuring public trust in our elections is at the core of our democracy, but federal overreach is not how we achieve this.”\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, Democrats passed the For the People Act through the House, seeking to establish an aggressive set of federal rules to bolster voting rights and ban partisan gerrymandering. A majority of senators supported a slimmed-down version, called the Freedom to Vote Act, but it died because of a Republican-led filibuster.\n\nAt the time, Senate Republicans vehemently opposed the measure, saying election rules must be left to states.\n\n“This is not a federal issue,” McConnell told reporters in January 2022 when the bill came before the Senate. “It ought to be left to the states. There’s nothing broken around the country. The system upheld very well during an intense stress during the latter part of the previous Congress. There’s no rational basis for federalizing this election, and, therefore, there’s no point in having a debate in the U.S. Senate about something we ought not do.”\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "description": "Lutnick admitted to visiting the late pedophile’s private island in sworn testimony earlier Tuesday before the Senate Commerce Committee",
    "fullText": "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday abruptly cut short a briefing with reporters after a reporter asked about Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe question came hours after Lutnick, responding to questions from congressional lawmakers over documents released by the Justice Department, revealed that he misled the public about the extent of his ties to the convicted pedophile sex trafficker, who killed himself in jail while awaiting trial.\n\nLeavitt was roughly 20 minutes into one of her regular briefings with the White House press corps when a reporter asked whether President Donald Trump would stand behind Lutnick, who earlier in the day had admitted to members of the Senate Commerce Committee that he’d visited Epstein’s notorious private island, Little Saint James.\n\nShe replied that Trump “fully supports” Lutnick and described him as “a very important member of President Trump's team.”\n\nBut instead of allowing reporters to probe further into Trump’s views on Lutnick, or ask any other further questions, Leavitt launched into a monologue chastising reporters for not asking about various positive statistics touted by the administration on issues of importance to the president.\n\n“I will just point out that there are a lot of wins in the news this week that people in this room have not asked about — you continue to ask questions about the same subject — so let me point them out for you again,” she said.\n\nLeavitt then started rattling off a list of days-old topics, including stock market results from this past Friday, a medical group announcing opposition to performing gender transition surgery on minors, or recent reductions in the national crime rate.\n\n“So we're going to get back to business. The president is very busy tonight, and you'll see him all tomorrow at the event in the East Room touting his administration’s energy policy,” she said.\n\nShe then turned and walked out of the room with a group of aides in tow.\n\nLeavitt also answered a question about another document released by the administration which relayed a secondhand report alleging that Trump had spoken to a Palm Beach, Florida police chief about Epstein and claimed that “everyone” knew about the pedophile’s illegal activities with minors.\n\nAlthough she would not confirm whether the alleged 2006 phone call actually happened, she claimed Trump has always been “honest and transparent” about his relationship with Epstein, who was once among one of his closest friends before the two men had a falling-out in the early 2000s.\n\nLutnick, a longtime friend of the president who had pushed to become Treasury Secretary after serving as the finance chief for Trump’s 2024 campaign, has not been similarly “honest and transparent” about his ties to the dead rapist.\n\nWhile he had told the New York Post in October that he’d cut off contact with Epstein — his onetime next door neighbor — after a 2005 encounter that he claimed had left him so unsettled that he’d vowed to “never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again,” documents released by the Justice Department showed that Lutnick not only maintained ties with Epstein as late as 2018 — the year before he was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges and long after he’d spent time in jail for state-level offenses related to his preying on young girls — but even arranged a visit to Epstein’s so-called “rape island” in 2012.\n\nThe commerce secretary admitted to visiting the infamous landmass, which is part of the U.S. Virgin Islands, on Tuesday under questioning from Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen.\n\n“I did have lunch with him, as I was on a boat going across on a family vacation. My wife was with me, as were my four children and nannies,” he said.\n\n“We had lunch on the island, that is true, for an hour, and we left with all of my children with my nannies and my wife … I don’t recall why we did it.”\n\nLutnick also claimed in his testimony that he “did not have any relationship with” Epstein and “barely had anything to do with that person.”",

    "description": "California's 91 Freeway uses AI cameras to catch solo HOV lane drivers, recovering $1 million in unpaid tolls through interior car photography.",
    "fullText": "Twenty-five thousand people monthly thought they were gaming the system on the 91 Express Lanes. Turns out, the house always wins — especially when it’s equipped with computer vision that can photograph your car’s interior through tinted windows. Since August 2025, Riverside County’s new Occupancy Detection System has been quietly documenting every solo driver pretending their gym bag is a passenger, recovering over $1 million in unpaid tolls and fees.\n\nThe technology reads like something from a dystopian Netflix series, except it’s scanning your morning commute. Cameras positioned at the end of the expressway capture multiple photographs of vehicle interiors. AI software flags potential violations before human reviewers at the Riverside County Transportation Commission confirm whether you actually have three people aboard. Get caught? You’ll pay the full toll plus a $5 “correction fee” — their polite term for getting busted.\n\nThis isn’t your typical red-light camera — the system spots fake passengers with unsettling accuracy.\n\nRCTC spokesperson Ariel Alcon reports catching drivers using “hats on headrests, putting items in baby car seats and even using mannequins” to fool the old enforcement system. The ODS isn’t impressed by your creativity. The technology distinguishes between actual humans and decoy passengers, even identifying properly installed car seats as legitimate occupants.\n\nConsider the scale: 400,000 cars use the 91 daily, with more than 100,000 breaking HOV rules. That’s roughly one in four drivers thinking they’re smarter than the system. Spoiler alert: they’re not.\n\nOfficials promise face-blurring and privacy compliance, but your driving habits are now permanent data.\n\nThe system protects privacy by blurring faces and storing images according to state and federal privacy laws.

    "title": "Here's How Long You Should Rest Between Workout Sets",
    "description": "30 seconds is not enough (usually).",
    "fullText": "A typical strength- or muscle-building workout happens in sets. You lift the weight a certain number of times (“reps”), then you put it down for a quick rest before going again. But how long should that rest be? The answer will depend on a few factors, including the purpose of the workout. And a lot of us aren't resting enough.\n\nLet's talk about the point of rest times. If you can keep moving for an entire workout without ever stopping to rest, you're probably not doing very effective strength training. Cardio can be continuous; most forms of strength training require that you work so hard you must rest.\n\nSo we do our strength exercises in \"sets\" of some number of \"reps.\" You do 10 reps of shoulder press, and then put the weight down for a minute or so. By resting appropriately, you give your muscles time to recover so they can do another set. The longer the rest, the heavier the weight you can usually handle in the next set.\n\nBut there are pros and cons to long and short rest times. The longer you rest between sets, the more recovered you'll feel. But the shorter your rests, the more work you'll be able to do in a given gym session. Choosing the most appropriate rest time for each exercise will get you the best gains in the gym. But the optimal rest time will depend on what kind of exercise you're doing and what your goals are. So let's go over some pros and cons of long and short rest times.\n\nLonger rests (say, three minutes or more) are best for strength workouts where the goal is to improve both your strength and your skill at lifting heavy weights. After all, you need practice at lifting heavy if you want to be able to lift heavy. After you put a heavy barbell down, you'll need several minutes for your body to be ready to do another big lift. Long rest times are best for:\n\nCompound exercises (those that use many muscles) like squats, deadlifts, snatches, and power cleans.\n\nHeavier weights. If you're working with barbells or doing fewer than 8 reps, you probably want a nice long rest.\n\nAmbitious strength goals. If you have a goal in mind—someday bench 225, for example—the kind of training that will get you there will require heavy weights and long rests.\n\nIn the three to five minutes you might rest between sets of (say) barbell squats, the ATP in your muscles regenerates. You get some blood flow to bring oxygen and nutrients into your muscle cells, and flush away metabolic byproducts. Resting for several minutes gives you the best chance of coming back to the next set at full strength.\n\nThe longer you rest—within reason—the more fully recovered you’ll be for the next set. If you only allow yourself one minute, you’ll still be fatigued when you pick up the weight again. But if you wait longer, you’ll be able to handle more weight.\n\nThe main disadvantage of long rest times is time management. Your workouts will be longer if you rest five minutes between exercises instead of one or two. You may also find yourself getting distracted between sets. You scroll social media for a bit, and somehow it's been eight minutes since you last touched a weight. Setting a timer can help with this.\n\nSome people get antsy during long rests, and will pass the time by doing pushups or jumping jacks. That kind of defeats the purpose of long rests. Save the supersets for your accessory work afterwards, not the main lift where you're trying to go heavy.\n\nFor an exercise where you're using large muscle groups (like a squat or deadlift), five minutes is typical once you're up to your heaviest working weights for the day. Warmup sets don't need as much time.\n\nFor exercises where you're working on strength but it's a lighter lift or uses smaller muscles (like overhead press), two to three minutes is usually plenty.\n\nWhen it comes to muscle growth, also called hypertrophy, shorter rests can make more sense. To be clear, strength and muscle growth are related, but not the same thing. If you aren't interested in lifting the heaviest weight possible, just in making your muscles bigger or your body more \"toned,\" you would want to pay attention to the best rest times for hypertrophy. These will be shorter than for pure strength. Use short rests for:\n\nIsolation exercises (those that only target one muscle group at a time).\n\nLighter weights. \"Accessory\" exercises with small weights don't need as much rest time.\n\nTraining for muscle size when strength is less important. If you don't care how much weight you're lifting, and you just want to move a weight and be done with your workout, short rests can help keep the workout moving while still giving your muscles something to do.\n\nTraditionally, trainers say that 90 seconds or less is a good rule of thumb. (The National Academy of Sports Medicine recommends 0 to 60 seconds; the personal training textbooks from the National Strength and Conditioning Association and the American Council on Exercise both recommend 30 to 90 seconds.)\n\nBut research has shown that short rest periods may not actually be better for muscle growth than longer ones. A 2016 study found that three-minute rest periods actually yielded more muscle growth than one-minute rests. The authors think this is because the men in their three-minute group (yep, the study was only done on men) were able to use heavier weights than the men in the one-minute group. Since the number of sets was the same in both groups, this means the three-minute group lifted more weight.\n\nA more recent meta-analysis also comes down on the side of longer rests. According to the studies they included in the analysis, the authors found that 30 to 60 seconds is likely too short. Resting one to two minutes between sets is best for muscle growth, they say. But according to this, more than two minutes doesn't really help, and may slow down your workout enough that you get fewer sets in.\n\nThe shorter your rests, the lighter weights you'll work with. This is fine if you're trying to make do with light dumbbells, but it means you're not getting practice with heavier weights. Most of us want to be jacked and strong, so short rest times mean you're biasing yourself to the muscle size side of the equation.\n\nVery short rest times (less than a minute) may also interfere with your ability to make the biggest gains, as the studies above noted. You may be able to make up for this by doing more sets of the exercise. If you enjoy the go-go-go feeling of short rests, that may be totally fine with you. Add an extra set or two and you know you're using your time well. For the rest of us, though, slowing down and taking a full minute between sets will be better than rushing it.\n\nOne to two minutes is likely the sweet spot, according to recent studies. That's on the higher end of the recommended 30 to 90 seconds. It's fine to do some of your rests shorter and some longer, but if you'd like me to tell you what to punch in on your timer, go with 90 seconds.\n\nUltimately, you may be best off using a mix of long and short rest times, which is how a lot of strength training programs are designed. Use longer rest times for a few big compound lifts at the beginning of the workout (like squats or bench press) and shorter rest times for circuits, accessories, or isolation exercises afterward (like curls or glute bridges).\n\nSupersets are a great way to split the difference. If you work different muscle groups in two different exercises, you can do one exercise while the other muscles rest. This isn't your best option if you truly want all your energy and focus to go toward one lift (like if you're working up to a PR on your bench press) but it's a great way to do hypertrophy work. For example, try this:\n\nIn this example, if it takes you 30 seconds to do the set of pushups, you've rested 90 total seconds in between your first set of pullups and your second set of pullups.\n\nOkay, but what if you want to get stronger and grow muscle? What if you want to stop overthinking the specifics and do whatever rest period makes you look like a normal person at the gym who knows what they’re doing? Here’s a cheat sheet:\n\nFor pushups and pull-ups: If you do a small to medium number of reps (less than 12), treat them as a strength exercise and wait three to five minutes between sets. If you’re one of those people banging out 20 or 50 at a time, you probably want to take rests of about a minute so that fatigue can make your next set a bit shorter and you can finish your workout in this lifetime.\n\nFor barbell squats and deadlifts: These are compound lifts that use many muscles in your body. They’re pretty much always done (relatively) heavy, and it’s useful to build strength in these moves. Treat them as a strength exercise and wait three to five minutes.\n\nFor bench press, overhead press, chest press, and shoulder press: These involve smaller muscles and less weight than squats and deadlifts, but they still qualify as compound, strength-focused exercises. Two to three minutes will be enough, most of the time, but take up to five on heavy sets if you need to.\n\nFor rows and lat pulldowns: Same as the presses, for the same reasons. Two to three minutes may be enough, but up to five would still be reasonable.\n\nFor isolation exercises: if you’re trying to feel the burn or the pump, short rests will really help you here. Take 30 seconds between sets.\n\nThese are just guidelines, so feel free to experiment. If you want to work on your cardiovascular conditioning, take a little less rest between sets. If you’ve already done a big set of bench presses today, do the rest of your arm and chest accessories with shorter rest periods.\n\nLet's do a lightning round, since I know rest times are a huge subject of discussion among people who are getting the hang of the gym routine. But first, a plea for you to not overthink this: if you simply rest until you feel ready to go again, you'll probably do ok.\n\nNo. If you're trying to move a heavy weight, you probably want to rest a minimum of three minutes. If you're training for muscle size (and don't care as much about strength), you could shorten your rests a bit. Still, it's not bad to rest too long, just slightly inefficient.\n\nAt that point I wouldn't call it a rest time, just a different workout. When you come back to the gym after that hour, you'll need to warm up all over again. I would say if it's been more than 10 or 15 minutes between sets, or if you feel like you're physically cooling down, it's worth doing some kind of exercise just to keep your body ready. This could be pushups while you're waiting for a bench to free up, for example.\n\nAs a noob, you're probably not lifting very heavy (yet). That means you don't have a lot to rest from. Say you're doing squats: your body is still learning how to squat at all. You aren't taking 300 pounds for a ride and needing to rest several minutes to recover.\n\nFor that reason, newer people may not need to rest as much. Two minutes between squat sets? Sure, that's fine if you feel ready. The pitfall here is that if you get used to taking short rests, you could end up working with weights that are too light for you. After your first few weeks at the gym, make sure to do some of your heavier lifts with longer rest times (at least three minutes) and see if you feel fresher.\n\nIf you can do multiple sets of an exercise without resting in between, you're not using an appropriate weight. There's supposed to be a difference between three sets of 10, and one set of 30. If your workout says to do 3x10, you're supposed to feel tired enough after that 10th rep that you need to rest at least a minute or two before going again.\n\nAnd yes, it can be awkward to be standing around in the squat rack, doing nothing or even scrolling on your phone while others are waiting. But remember: Everybody rests between sets! Or at least, they should.",

    "title": "What to Do If (or When) Your Email Is Leaked to the Dark Web",
    "description": "Don't panic: This really happens to the best of us.",
    "fullText": "The dark web has a bad reputation—one it has earned, at that. It's a complex subsection of the web, and it's not all bad by any means, but its nature does allow illicit and illegal activity to prosper anonymously. That's why hackers choose the dark web as their point of sale for stolen user data: If you're going to traffic digital contraband, you're going to do so as privately as possible.\n\nAs such, you might be a bit stressed if you're told your email address was found on the dark web. Maybe you use an identity theft service, which discovered your information here. Perhaps you're noticing an uptick in spam, especially spam that seems targeted to you personally. In any case, it's understandable to be anxious. The good news is, this is more common than you think, and there are steps you can take to protect your data going forward.\n\nDespite its aforementioned reputation, the dark web is not \"Evil Doers Central.\" It's simply one part of the deep web, or the part of the internet not indexed by search engines. The deep web makes up the vast majority of the global internet, but the dark web is unique, because it requires a specific type of browser, like Tor, and knowledge of specific dark web addresses, to access.\n\nThe dark web is inherently private, and inherently anonymous. That's why it attracts bad actors. But that doesn't mean that's all it's good for. Anyone who needs to access the internet without worrying about intervention can use the dark web. Think about journalists in countries that would rather they not tell their stories, or citizens whose governments censor the public internet. There's plenty of bad to be had, to be sure, but there's also perfectly innocent and productive content, too. \n\nIf your email address is on the dark web, it's likely because one of the companies you shared it with suffered a data breach. Unfortunately, data breaches happen all the time, and there's really no way to ensure that a company you choose to share your email address with won't be a victim of a breach at some point in the future. Sometimes the company itself is breached; other times, it's a third-party the company shares data to.\n\nWhen bad actors break into an organization's systems and steal their data, they often put the spoils on the dark web. This makes it easier to sell the stolen data anonymously. As such, it's really no surprise if your email ends up on the dark web—though that might not be much consolation.\n\nYour email address is for sale, and someone buys it. Now what? Well, such a hacker could choose a few tactics here. First, they'll likely want to try breaking into different accounts you might have used that email address with. If you lost any passwords in the data breach, they might try those, too. That's why it's an excellent idea to change your passwords as soon as you learn about the breach—but more on that later.\n\nIf they can't break into your accounts on their own, they'll want to enlist your services—unknowingly, of course. To do so, they'll likely target you in phishing attacks, and, seeing as they know your email address, they'll probably come via email. There are a lot of phishing campaigns out there, but here are some examples: You might receive fake data breach notices, with a link to check your account; you might find a message telling you it's time to change your password; you might get an email warning you about a login attempt; you might even receive an aggressive email, with demands from the hackers.\n\nHackers may also choose to impersonate you. They might create an email that looks very similar to yours, and reach out to your contacts in order to trick them into thinking it's really you. Tell your close contacts (especially any you think won't look close at the \"from\" line in an email) that your email was leaked on the dark web, and to watch out for imposters.\n\nFirst of all, don't panic. Again, data breaches happen so often that many of our email addresses (among other data) have leaked onto the dark web. While this isn't a good thing, it also isn't the end of the world.\n\nNext, change your passwords, starting with your email account itself. If you know the account the email was stolen from, make sure to change this next, as your password may have also be affected in the data breach. As usual, make each password strong and unique: You should never reuse passwords with any account, and all of them should be long and difficult for both humans and computers to guess. As long as each of your accounts uses a strong and unique password, you really shouldn't have to change all of your passwords: Hackers may have your email, but they won't have all these passwords to use with it.\n\nFrom here, make sure all of your accounts use two-factor authentication (2FA), when available. 2FA ensures that even if you have the email address and password for a given account, you still need access to a trusted device to verify your identity. Hackers won't be able to do anything with your stolen credentials if they don't have physical access to, say, your smartphone. This is a crucial step for maintaining your security following a data breach. You could also choose to use passkeys instead of passwords for any accounts that offers it. Passkeys combine the convenience of passwords with the security of 2FA: You log in with your fingerprint, face scan, or PIN, and there's no password to actually steal.\n\nFrom here, monitor your various accounts connected to this email, especially your financial accounts. Your email address alone likely won't put you in too much jeopardy, but if you lost additional information, you'll want to ensure hackers don't breach your important accounts. You could take drastic steps, like freezing your credit, but, again, if it's just your email address, this is likely a step too far.\n\nWhile some data removal services claim to be able to remove data like email addresses from the dark web, it's just not 100% possible. The dark web is vast and unregulated, and once the data leaks onto it, the cat's kind of out of the bag. Sure, a service like DeleteMe could request data web hosts to take down your email, but they don't have to. Plus, hackers who buy your email already have it. Again, exposed email addresses are not the end of the world. But if you can't stand having your email on the dark web, your best bet may be to make a new account.\n\nWhat you can do is take measures to prevent data loss in the future. The best step to take is to stop sharing your email in the first place. You don't need to be a hermit, though: Use an email alias service, like Apple's Hide My Email or Proton's email alias feature, to generate a new alias every time you need to share your email. Messages sent to the alias are forwarded to your inbox, so the experience is the same for you, all without exposing your actual address to the world. If one of these companies suffers a data breach, no problem: Just retire the alias.\n\nTo that point, going forward, consider using a data monitoring and removal service. Maybe you already do, and that's how you learned about your email on the dark web to begin with. But if you don't, there are many options out there to choose from. While none can promise they'll remove email addresses from the dark web, they might spot your email if it ends up there. If you use aliases, you can then kill that particular address and make a new one for the affected account. Plus, if your email ends up somewhere other than the dark web, they might be able to remove it for you.",

    "description": "You'll need to enroll in the beta to try it early.",
    "fullText": "While there are a lot of chat apps out there, WhatsApp is the undeniable leader of the pack. The app has over three billion monthly active users, constantly messaging and calling one another across the globe. However, currently those calls are all happening over the mobile app, or maybe the desktop app. Though WhatsApp does have a web app, the service has never supported audio or video calls outside of its downloadable apps—until now.\n\nAccording to WABetaInfo, WhatsApp is slowly rolling out audio and video calls to its web app. At launch, the functionality is coming to individual chats with users who elect to enroll in the WhatsApp web app's beta, but the company plans to roll out the feature to all web app users over the coming weeks.\n\nWABetaInfo notes that voice and audio calls work about the same as they do in the WhatsApp desktop app. When you open an individual chat in the web app, you'll now see a video call icon at the top. Click this, and you'll find two options: one to place a voice call, and one to place a video call. These calls are still end-to-end encrypted, as they are on WhatsApp's desktop and mobile apps, meaning only the users who are a part of the calls can hear what's being said. In addition, the web app's video call client supports Screen Share, so you can share a live stream of your computer's screen to another WhatsApp contact.\n\nWhatsApp is also reportedly working on group chat calls for web app users, as well. While that feature won't roll out alongside individual calls, when it does launch, you'll be able to join group chats with up to 32 people.\n\nIf you tend to use the WhatsApp desktop or mobile apps, this might not seem like huge news—but it is pretty substantial for a few subsets of WhatsApp users. One, of course, is the user base that just prefers using WhatsApp in their computer's web browser—but the other is Linux users. WhatsApp doesn't actually offer a version of its desktop app for Linux, so those users have to use the web app if they want to run WhatsApp on their computers. That means they've never before been able to place calls without pulling out a mobile device.\n\nThis feature will soon roll out to all web app users, but until then, you need to be running the WhatsApp web app beta in order to try it.\n\nLuckily, it's pretty easy to get up and running. To start, open the web app, then head to the settings menu, choose \"Help,\" then choose the \"Join beta\" option. This will immediately switch you over to the beta version of the web app. (You should see a \"Beta\" label on your screen.) Now that you're running the beta, should you find the option to place calls in individual chats.",

    "description": "Does Heart of Midlothian's late derby winner against Hibernian suggest they are developing the habit of champions as they go six points clear at the top of the Scottish Premiership?",
    "fullText": "Heart of Midlothian v Hibernian highlights\n\nAnother late derby win for Heart of Midlothian, another late goal that sparked jubilation around the stands at Tynecastle, another Derek McInnes celebration with a ballboy.\n\nTomas Magnusson's 88th-minute strike in Tuesday's Edinburgh derby at home to Hibernian added yet more veracity to a title charge that few would have found believable at the start of the season.\n\nIt is not the first time this campaign when they have produced a moment of magic in the last few minutes, or even dying seconds, to fuel the fires of belief among their fans.\n\nIt is the habit of champions. The ability to rescue victory from the jaws of defeat, to conjure three points from the ashes.\n\nCeltic and Rangers have done it plenty over the years - the former did it again in the Scottish Cup at the weekend - and now Hearts are showing they can do it too.\n\nBoy did they need it after last week's defeat away to St Mirren and with both sides of the Old Firm improving since changing their managers.\n\nDefeat by Hibs would have given Rangers the chance to go top when they visit Motherwell on Tuesday.\n\nInstead, with just 12 games to go, McInnes' side, who have been out in front since September, are six points clear of Danny Rohl's Ibrox side as they face a difficult away trip to the side sitting fourth.\n\nReigning champions Celtic are a further three points back, albeit with an extra game in hand.\n\nListen: Reaction as Hearts edge Hibs with late derby winner\n\nMotherwell v Rangers, O'Neill & Nygren in focus\n\nHearts extend Premiership lead with late derby winner against Hibs\n\nYou only need to look at the second round of fixtures in this campaign to find the first example of Hearts digging deep and finding a late winner.\n\nIt came at Tannadice, where Stuart Findlay popped up late to overturn a 2-1 deficit against Dundee United and give McInnes' side all three points.\n\nThey did it again at the end of August, against Livingston, when Alexandros Kyziridis scored at Almondvale to secure a 2-1 win.\n\nThen there was Craig Halkett's goal in the first derby of the season, a 91st-minute strike as he slid in to connect with a Sabah Kerjota cross.\n\nIt is not just goals, either. Look at Craig Gordon's save, away to Dundee, with the team down to 10 men after fellow goalkeeper Alexander Schwolow's red card.\n\nHolding on at 1-0, the veteran Scotland international somehow kept Emile Acquah's header from ripping away two precious points.\n\nTo put a statistic to it, Hearts have scored 12 goals in the last 15 minutes of league matches this season. Only one side have scored more - Rangers.\n\n\"What we've got in abundance is a desire to make the game go our way,\" head coach McInnes said. \"Harry Milne's desire to get the ball to the byeline, Tomas Magnusson's desire to get on the end of it. That's what I'm talking about.\n\n\"I always feel we've got a goal in us. It's very rarely we don't score. What a brilliant moment for us. Tynecastle was such a beautiful sight.\"\n\nThe late goals are not the only habit that Hearts are forming. Winning the hard way, getting maximum points from a bare minimum performance, is something that title-winning teams do too.\n\n\"If you want to challenge for titles and win leagues, you have to win ugly, and Hearts did that tonight,\" former Celtic defender Charlie Mulgrew told Premier Sports.\n\nHe was not the only pundit to comment on Hearts' below-par performance. While McInnes named an attacking side, they looked timid in the build up, struggling to stay calm in the typical chaos of an Edinburgh derby.\n\n\"They'll not really care about the performance, they've got 12 games to create history,\" former Hearts midfielder Ryan Stevenson, who also had a hard job picking a man of the match, told BBC Sportsound.\n\n\"Harry Milne, for me, he tried everything he possible could to affect the game, to drive Hearts forward. Other than him, pretty much all of them were stinking.\"\n\nWell, quite. Scott Allan, the former Hibs and Celtic midfielder, was a bit more eloquent in his assessment.\n\n\"Tonight was such a big game and to not play well at all... I couldn't see Hearts scoring a goal, I thought there was only going to be one winner and it was Hibs,\" he reflected.\n\n\"To win like that, clean sheet as well, it says so much about what you're building in there.\n\n\"Derek McInnes will not be worried about that performance. What a position that puts Hearts into, going into that game on Sunday.\"\n\nAh yes, the game on Sunday. Rangers at Ibrox. Hearts won there back in September, their first victory away to the blue half of Glasgow since 2014.\n\nNo-one could have imagined then that, the next time Hearts came to town, the visitors would still have a lead over their hosts in the standings.\n\n\"If they get three points at Ibrox, I think they'll win the league,\" Stevenson predicted. A big call for a big game.\n\nVisit our Hearts page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Hearts news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "fullText": "Swansea City co-owner Snoop Dogg will attend one of the Championship club's games for the first time when they face Preston North End on Tuesday, 24 February (19:45 GMT).\n\nThe American rapper became an investor at Swansea last July and said last month that he wants to help the Welsh side become a \"global name\".\n\nSnoop Dogg will now make his long-awaited first appearance at a Swansea fixture when Vitor Matos' team host Preston.\n\n\"From the moment we talked about me becoming an owner, I have been looking forward to the chance to be with you all at the Swansea.com Stadium,\" Snoop Dogg told the club's website.\n\n\"I have heard so many great things about the atmosphere, especially when we play under the lights.\n\n\"When I watched the Wrexham game [on television in December], where we showed we are the capital of Welsh football, the noise in the stadium sounded incredible even from over 5,000 miles away. I can't wait to be a part of it.\"\n\nSwansea say Snoop Dogg will appear pitchside prior to the Preston game £to lead supporters in a pre-match fan display\".\n\n\"In addition to watching the Swans in action, the 21-time Grammy nominee and four-time Emmy award winner will also take the opportunity to visit areas of our local community to meet supporters and experience life in our city and region,\" the club added.\n\nSnoop Dogg, 54, is in Europe for the Winter Olympics that finish on 22 February.\n\nHe is with Team USA at the Games, which are taking place in Italy, as a hype man and 'honorary coach'.\n\nSnoop Dogg had been expected to visit at some stage this season after he followed Real Madrid legend Luka Modric by becoming a co-owner of the club.\n\nThey have since been joined by a third celebrity investor, with billionaire American businesswoman Martha Stewart – who is a friend of Snoop Dogg – coming on board in December.\n\nLatest Swansea City news, analysis and fan views\n\nListen to the latest Swansea City interviews, news and discussion on BBC Sounds\n\nMatos plays down play-off talk despite Swans' form\n\n\"We want to take Swansea to the Premier League, and to do that we are going to need money - that's the reality of the game these days,\" Snoop Dogg said in January.\n\n\"I want to introduce sponsorship deals and publicity that will make them a global name.\"\n\nSnoop Dogg will follow his son, Cordell Broadus, who was in the directors' box for Swansea's draw with Watford last August.\n\nThe Swans' owners, led by American duo Brett Cravatt and Jason Cohen, believe bringing in high-profile names at boardroom level will help increase the club's profile and, in turn, boost income.",

    "fullText": "Glentoran manager Declan Devine says he is \"gutted\" after league leaders Larne netted a late equaliser against his side, who were shown two red cards, at Inver Park.\n\nPaul O'Neill's penalty on 21 minutes gave the home side the lead before two goals from Pat Hoban flipped the game on its head.\n\nHowever, goalscorer Hoban was then dismissed with Gary Haveron's side awarded another penalty deep into stoppage time and Andy Ryan able to convert the rebound of his effort.\n\n\"The game itself is an entertaining game. I thought we were very much in control of our own destiny,\" Devine told BBC Sport NI.\n\n\"The sending offs are ridiculous and if they are given then three or four players are sent off in every game.\n\n\"I don't think Larne caused us that many problems to be honest, a couple of half chances. I am just gutted for the players, the quality that they showed and that, again, we come here and every decision in the game goes against you.\"\n\nAs well as Hoban's dismissal, Cooney also picked up a straight red card after the final whistle following an altercation with referee Shane Andrews with Devine adding that decision was a \"farce\".\n\n\"The players deserve huge credit as they delivered everything we asked of them and, even when down to 10, we were very comfortable and to give the second penalty is inexcusable in the 95th minute,\" Devine continued.\n\n\"To send Ryan Cooney off after the game is a farce, an absolute farce.\n\n\"We are trying to make the league professional and a really high level. It is the players, managers and staff's livelihoods and for people to make decisions like they did tonight, I have no words.\"\n\nHowever, Larne manager Haveron disagreed with Devine and added that his side should have had another penalty when it appeared that Jarlath O'Rourke used his hand to block Ryan's effort.\n\n\"There was a bit of drama at the end. We weren't at our best, but I always say when you're not at your best then don't lose,\" Haveron said.\n\n\"It's a stonewall penalty. They can say whatever they want but his hand was high. The one with Jarlath O'Rourke is a shocking decision. It really was shocking and it could have cost us massively if we lost the game.\n\n\"That could make a difference in the run-in. It's really poor and there's no excuses for it, it was on the line. It needs to be looked at, in my opinion. He got one right, but the one with 10 or 15 minutes to go, he handled the ball on the line.\"",

    "description": "Mark Zuckerberg owns over 1,200 acres of land. Here's a look at the Facebook founder's US properties, from a Hawaii bunker to Lake Tahoe houses.",
    "fullText": "Mark Zuckerberg has been quietly snapping up massive chunks of real estate for years.\n\nThe tech billionaire has bought hundreds of acres of Hawaiian land.\n\nRecently, he also reportedly bought property in Miami.\n\nMark Zuckerberg is one of the world's richest people, and his multimillion-dollar real estate portfolio reflects that.\n\nThe man responsible for Facebook is worth an estimated $231 billion, Forbes reported, and part of that fortune includes assets like a sprawling California compound and acres of lush land on a Hawaiian island.\n\nZuckerberg's real estate dealings are often shrouded in privacy, including the use of limited-liability companies and addresses linked to the investment management firm Iconiq Capital.\n\nHis most recent real estate deal, as reported by The Wall Street Journal, is a mansion on Indian Creek, an exclusive South Florida island that's home to other tech titans like Jeff Bezos. Representatives for Zuckerberg at Meta declined to comment to Business Insider.\n\nOver the years, Zuckerberg has bought and sold homes all over the country. He's also reportedly built some — a Hawaiian doomsday ranch that has had many scratching their heads, for example.\n\nHere's what we know about his real estate portfolio.\n\nZuckerberg owns a residential compound in Palo Alto.\n\nIt's no surprise that a tech titan has more than one property in Silicon Valley. The Meta CEO owns five homes in the Crescent Park neighborhood of Palo Alto.\n\nHe gave viewers a rare peek inside one of them in 2016; the house is even tricked out with a \"custom-made artificially intelligent assistant,\" according to CNBC. The home is only a 10-minute drive from the Meta HQ in Menlo Park.\n\nHe bought the first Crescent Park property in May 2011 for $7 million.\n\nArchitectural Digest described it as a \"'no frills abode\" that chooses function over extravagance. Zuckerberg then spent over $43 million on the four homes surrounding his original residence in Crescent Park, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nHe sold his San Francisco townhouse in 2022 for a reported $31 million.\n\nThe four-bedroom, four-bathroom home is located near San Francisco's Dolores Park. He and his wife, Priscilla Chan, reportedly spent $10 million to purchase the townhouse in 2010.\n\nAt the time of the sale in 2022, it was the largest residential real estate deal in the city.\n\nHe bought two adjacent estates on the shore of Lake Tahoe around 2019.\n\nLake Tahoe is a popular vacation destination for wealthy Californians in both summer and winter, and Zuckerberg and his family are no exception.\n\nThe tax records of the two properties — known as Carousel Estate and Brushwood Estate — display the same address as tax records of other properties linked to Zuckerberg, according to documents viewed by BI.\n\nZuckerberg reportedly paid $59 million for both properties.\n\nAt 5,322 square feet, the Brushwood Estate features six bedrooms, five baths, and two half baths, according to SF Gate. Inside are high-beamed ceilings and picture windows; outside are lush trees, a private dock, and a hot tub. There's also a 2,293-square-foot guesthouse.\n\nThe Meta exec owns over 1,200 acres of land in Hawaii.\n\nIt's unclear exactly how many acres of land Zuckerberg currently owns on Kauai, but he began buying up a region of the island back in 2014.\n\nBusiness Insider tracked down at least 1,200 acres between 17 parcels of land that have the same tax address as other properties mentioned above, but are owned by LLCs including Kahu'aina Holdings LLC and Pila'a International LLC.\n\nThe 1,200 acres include about 750 acres he reportedly paid $100 million in 2014 for. That encompasses a more than 350-acre span of land on Pila'a Beach.\n\nHis plans for Koolau Ranch seem to be in preparation for the worst case scenario.\n\nAnother part of Zuckerberg's Hawaii holdings is the nearly 600 acres of land on Kauai's North Shore that reportedly cost him around $53 million in 2021.\n\nOn one of his Hawaiian parcels, Zuckerberg is reportedly building a huge compound that's said to include a 5,000-square-foot underground bunker with an escape hatch. It's been dubbed Koolau Ranch, and Wired reported that buying the land and creating the compound cost the executive an estimated $270 million.\n\nIn March 2025, he purchased a 15,000-square-foot mansion in Washington, DC.\n\nAs Silicon Valley continues to infiltrate Washington, DC, Zuckerberg established a residence in the US capital, Politico said. The home that's reportedly his new pad is situated in Massachusetts Avenue Heights, not far from the Naval Observatory and the Washington National Cathedral, according to Builder magazine.\n\nZuckerberg kept the purchase private, Politico said. The mansion in question was sold for $23 million in cash. It was designed by local firm Robert Gurney Architect and sits on about one acre of property.\n\nBusiness Insider was unable to independently confirm that Zuckerberg purchased the property.\n\nZuckerberg is also moving down the street from Jeff Bezos after reportedly buying property in Miami.\n\nMark Zuckerberg is reportedly adding a second East Coast property to his portfolio after buying a home in Miami, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nZuckerberg is purchasing a waterfront mansion on Indian Creek, an exclusive island in South Florida that's home to Jeff Bezos, Carl Icahn, and Jared Kushner.\n\nThe sold home previously belonged to a limited liability company linked to Peter Cancro, the founder of Jersey Mike's Subs. The property — which was just a home lot — was last traded for $37 million in 2021, Miami-Dade property records show.\n\nIt's unclear how much this off-market deal was worth, but an empty lot next door to Bezos sold for $105 million in 2025.\n\nHillary Hoffower contributed to an earlier version of this story.",

    "fullText": "From the astonishing to the emotional to the downright bizarre, the Olympic figure skating men's short program on Tuesday night had it all.\n\nBut the star once again was the USA's Ilia Malinin, who stormed to the top of the leaderboard with a stunning routine featuring a quad flip and quad lutz - two of the hardest techniques in the sport.\n\nAlthough he did not quite land the quad axel which has earned him the nickname 'Quad God', it put him top of the short program with a score of 108.16.\n\nAnd unlike in the team event, where he made errors and was somewhat style over substance, this was an ominously clean routine from the 21-year-old – and he even threw in a backflip for good measure.\n\nJapan's Yuma Kagiyama, generally regarded as Malinin's biggest competitor for first, is more than five points behind after slipping on his triple axel.\n\nKagiyama is second on 103.07, while France's Adam Siao Him Fa impressed with a score of 102.55. Daniel Grassl, the best hope for hosts Italy of another medal on the ice, sits fourth with 93.46.\n\nBut all eyes are on Malinin as he strives for individual Winter Olympic gold. He has not been beaten in competition for almost two and a half years.\n\nAnd after recording more than 200 points in the team event free skate – the second half of the men's event - which secured the USA team gold on Sunday, few would bet against him here.\n\nHe entered the rink ready for a fight, shadowboxing at the camera. And he brought the fight to his rivals.\n\nThe battle will be concluded on Friday evening in the free skate, where Malinin will be the 24th and last man to compete.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nIt is impossible to imagine what American skater Maxim Naumov has been through in the last 12 months.\n\nJust over a year ago, his parents - former world champion pairs skaters Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova - were among 67 people killed in a plane crash in Washington DC. Of those on board the flight, 28 were athletes, coaches or parents connected to US figure skating.\n\nNaumov said that his dream to make Team USA was one of the last things he spoke about with his parents before they were killed.\n\n\"They are my superheroes, my role models, and my biggest support system. I just wanted to make them proud here,\" he told the BBC after his performance.\n\n\"My dad said: 'Everything is practice until it is the Olympics'. I can't describe to you in words how much I just felt what he said. Also, there are truly no words for being able to step up to the occasion, I just wish that I made them proud.\"\n\nHe made it to the Games, and was second on the ice on Tuesday, dancing to Nocturne No. 20 by Frederic Chopin.\n\nAfter a slight slip on his triple axel, Naumov regained composure and skated a technically solid routine.\n\nAs he finished, the 24-year-old looked to the sky on his knees with tears in his eyes as the arena erupted. With a huge smile, cameras captured him saying \"thank you\" – perhaps to those both inside the arena, and in another place.\n\nAnd it was good enough for the judges, who awarded Naumov a season best of 85.65 points for the performance – enough for a spot in the top 24 and a place in the free skate on Friday.\n\nAs the scores came in, Naumov held up a picture of his late parents with him as a young child.\n\n\"I bring it everywhere that I go,\" he said of the image, which showed him holding hands with his parents while stood next to an ice rink. \"It is in my bag, so it is literally right here on my heart.\n\n\"They deserve to be here, to be right next to me, to look up at the scores together and say: 'Look at what we just did!'\"\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nOne of the most eye-catching stories in the build-up to the Games was that of Spanish figure skater Tomas-Llorenc Guarino Sabate.\n\nThroughout the 2025-26 season, Sabate has performed to songs from the Minions while wearing a yellow T-shirt and blue overalls, like the characters' outfits.\n\nHowever, at the Olympics it seemed as though Sabate, known for his flamboyant and unusual routines, would have to change his usual routine in the men's singles because of a copyright issue.\n\nAfter days of negotiations and online outcry, the issues were sorted and the Minion would skate.\n\nBut after all that, it went wrong almost immediately for Sabate as he tripped on his first element. The Universal fanfare, as done by Minions, had barely ended.\n\nUltimately there were too many technical errors, and a score of 69.80 was not enough to take him through as he finished in 25th place.\n\nBut Sabate, who has been keen to thank all those who took up his cause to allow his music at the Games, bowed with gusto to all four sides as one of Milan-Cortina's most memorable characters exited the stage.",

    "fullText": "It is hard to think of a more contrasting scene at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nOn a night Spurs manager Thomas Frank was subjected to humiliating chants of \"You're getting sacked in the morning\" from a section of his own supporters, opposite number Eddie Howe was repeatedly serenaded by a buoyant away end.\n\nHowe was even pushed in front of the travelling support by Bruno Guimaraes and Kieran Trippier to take the acclaim of the crowd after his side's 2-1 win.\n\nThe Newcastle head coach is not usually one for doing so.\n\nBut he could not help but punch the air before waving his arms up and down as Newcastle supporters roared in response.\n\n\"That was a special connection,\" he said. \"I'm grateful it's still there.\"\n\nThose words were uttered just a few days after Newcastle were booed off at St James' Park following a 3-2 defeat against Brentford.\n\nThat was an evening a crestfallen Howe admitted he was not doing his job \"well enough at the moment\".\n\nIt led to a lot of soul searching for Howe behind the scenes following just one win in eight games in all competitions.\n\n\"It was not an act,\" he said. \"That was me being very real and very genuine in terms of how I felt.\n\n\"I'll say it again. I've got to believe that I'm the right person to be in the job with all the sacrifices that it entails and I've got to feel that the players are playing for me.\n\n\"Today they showed that they are – but that has to be consistent moving forward.\"\n\nRamsey fires Newcastle to rare away win at Spurs\n\nThe sight of a number of Howe's players struggling with cramp in the closing stages certainly told you they were fighting for him.\n\nThey were maxed out on a night some familiar names and some more recent additions delivered for Newcastle.\n\nThe club's recruitment has rightly come under intense scrutiny - Newcastle have not seen much of an immediate return from a £250m summer spend - but three of Howe's signings stepped up on Wednesday.\n\nMalick Thiaw, the one undoubted early success, opened the scoring, the rapid Anthony Elanga put in his most impressive performance yet and Jacob Ramsey scored what proved to be the winner after netting his first goal for the club in the second half.\n\n\"I keep saying the lack of training is slowing their development,\" Howe said.\n\n\"But they are beginning to feel at home in the team and once you feel part of it, and feel integral to how the team plays, you can only get better.\"\n\nYet it was striking how Newcastle started the game without two headline additions.\n\nNick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa were left on the bench - just a few months after Howe spent £124m on the forwards.\n\nThat told its own story as the visitors lined up without a recognised striker for the second away league game in a row.\n\nAnthony Gordon was instead tasked with leading the line on the road again after Howe took heart from the opening half an hour of his side's 4-1 defeat against Liverpool.\n\nGordon put Newcastle in front at Anfield that night, but it was still a bold call.\n\nHowever, Gordon, Elanga and Harvey Barnes aggressively led the press out of possession as they hunted down Spurs' defenders and broke forward quickly with the ball.\n\nThere were still occasions where Newcastle were crying out for a poacher in the box to get on the end of a number of teasing crosses from Elanga.\n\nHowever, the speed of Newcastle's front line caused Spurs problems and Gordon's dancing feet set up Ramsey's winner.\n\nRemarkably, it was just travel-sick Newcastle's third away league victory of the season.\n\nNewcastle have too often been soft, throwing away more points (19) than any other side in the division.\n\nBut this was an evening where they \"really did inspire each other\" following a difficult few days.\n\n\"If anything they used it in a positive way and reinforced relationships,\" Howe added.\n\n\"It made us all look inward and look at what we're doing and how we can do it better.\"\n\nLatest Newcastle news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Newcastle - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Thomas Frank insists his job is not under threat at Tottenham Hotspur, despite his side extending their winless run in the Premier League to eight matches.\n\nSpurs suffered their 11th defeat of the season with a 2-1 home loss to Newcastle on Tuesday night.\n\nIt leaves Tottenham, one of six ever-present Premier League clubs in the top flight, five points above the relegation zone.\n\nBut Frank says he has been assured his position as manager is safe.\n\nAsked by TNT Sports if his job is under threat, Frank said: \"I spoke to them [owners] yesterday, so no.\n\n\"I understand the frustration and the easiest thing is to point at me. That's part of the job unfortunately. I will work day and night to turn this around but it is not just one person. There is no doubt we need to improve and I need to be part of that.\"\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Live about supporters booing at full-time, Frank added: \"I understand the frustration. It has been building up a little bit - last season it was similar playing in Europe and the Premier League.\n\n\"We need to be resilient, mentally and physically. I am 100% sure that it is a team effort, and it is not only one person. We are all aligned and we know what needs to be done.\"\n\nHaving taken 10 points from 15 in their first five Premier League fixtures under Frank, Spurs have managed just 19 from their next 21 matches.\n\nTheir run of eight games without a win is their longest since going nine without victory in 2008 under Juande Ramos - who was sacked with the club bottom of the table.\n\n\"You've got to say what it is and they are in a relegation fight,\" Spurs legend Glenn Hoddle told TNT Sports.\n\n\"The players have to understand that and the fans have to understand that.\n\n\"It is the reality and you have to scrap for every single point.\"\n\nBoos rang around Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on the final whistle, while there were pockets of empty seats at kick-off.\n\n\"A lot of fans have lost faith in what Thomas Frank is doing here,\" added former Spurs striker Les Ferdinand.\n\n\"It is desperate times. And desperate times call for desperate measures.\"\n\nThe Tottenham hierarchy now have a huge decision to make.\n\nThomas Frank's future at the club is uncertain. That isn't a secret, of course - it has been the case for weeks.\n\nLarge sections of the supporters want him sacked. The boos that rang round Tottenham Hotspur Stadium at full-time were testament to that prevailing feeling from a disgruntled fanbase.\n\nCrucially, there has been a loss of support towards the Dane internally.\n\nSo, the fact Frank's disastrous first season in charge lurched to deeper depths following this defeat by Newcastle may have significant consequences.\n\nIf Nottingham Forest, who occupy 17th, beat Wolves on Wednesday night they will go level on points with Tottenham.\n\nFrank is understandably hesitant to admit his side are in relegation fight - but the numbers don't lie.\n\nThat said, it may not be Frank's problem for much longer - Tottenham's latest loss will push the beleaguered manager closer to what appears an inevitable exit.\n\nIndeed, such has been the level of contemplation regarding Frank's immediate future at Tottenham in recent weeks that this loss will almost certainly trigger further soul-searching from the club's leadership group.\n\nThe fact the Spurs board have stuck by Frank during such a difficult period proves they want the appointment to work.\n\nThe easier decision would have been to show Frank the door by now.\n\nHowever, the Tottenham hierarchy believe Frank has been dealt a rough hand.\n\nThere's an acknowledgment that the season has been disrupted by multiple injuries to key players.\n\nThere is also recognition that the squad needs repair work - particularly considering the departures of their two main sources of goals in Harry Kane and Son Heung-min.\n\nThere is also a sense behind the scenes that the squad is lacking in leadership. It was why they signed England international Conor Gallagher and tried to land Andy Robertson from Liverpool - both with plenty of Premier League experience.\n\nThere is also a sense from Tottenham's executive team that the club require a period of managerial stability.\n\nBut by the same token, sources have told BBC Sport that work towards a contingency plan in the event they make a decision they really don't want to make illustrates the precarity of Frank's position.\n\nIf the club decide to part with Frank in the immediate aftermath of this Newcastle defeat, they will have 12 days until their next fixture against Arsenal on 22 February.\n\nThat leaves Tottenham with a prolonged window to execute their replacement plan and leave Frank's successor with time to implement a blueprint for the north London derby.\n\nThe pressure on Frank is at breaking point. We are about to find out if Tottenham crack.\n\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Tottenham - what do you want to know?",

It will be 12 days until United go to Everton.\n\nFor Michael Carrick, who was only appointed on 13 January, it is a good chance for his squad to \"refresh\", to allow some players to \"clean up their niggles and strains\" and \"take a bit of a breather\".\n\nBut it is also an opportunity to reflect.\n\nCarrick did not try and claim Benjamin Sesko's injury-time equaliser meant their 1-1 draw at West Ham felt like an extension of his four-match winning run, rather than the end of it, which it was.\n\nHowever, he did acknowledge the overall assessment of the last month has to be good.\n\n\"In the grand scheme of things, we take the point, dust ourselves down a little bit and assess it,\" he said.\n\n\"If you take it over a five-game period, to just have one draw in there is a big positive.\"\n\nSesko's 96th-minute strike earns Man Utd point at West Ham\n\n'No win, no trim' - has a haircut become a problem for Man Utd?\n\nCarrick's initial victories over title challengers Manchester City and Arsenal were unexpected. The ones against Fulham and Tottenham were anticipated but did not arrive without problems that had to be solved.\n\nCombined with the failings of Chelsea and Liverpool, the end outcome is United are fourth, with a handy, but by no means pivotal, advantage in the hunt for a Champions League return, something few could visualise in the wake of Ruben Amorim's dismissal following the draw at Leeds on 4 January.\n\n\"We know how hard it is to put a run together in this league,\" said Carrick, whose side are now unbeaten in nine league games, which spanned three managers, including initial interim Darren Fletcher.\n\n\"Sometimes it comes naturally, it flows and everything clicks. You look really dangerous and there's a spark. Sometimes it's a little bit stodgy.\"\n\nThe question being asked of Carrick is whether his side can deliver winning performances against opposition they are expected to beat.\n\nMany felt West Ham were in that category, even though Nuno Espirito Santo's side were aiming for their fourth win in five league games and they had led Chelsea 2-0 in the one that got away.\n\nCarrick did not manage a victory.\n\nWhat he did do was take a risk to try and get something from a game that appeared lost.\n\nWhen Manchester United drew against West Ham at Old Trafford in December, Amorim's only substitution involving an offensive player was Mason Mount for Joshua Zirkzee, 12 minutes from time.\n\nHis last change was one defender, Lisandro Martinez, for another, Luke Shaw. Midfielder Kobbie Mainoo and young forward Shea Lacey remained on the bench.\n\nAt London Stadium, Carrick gambled. Not so much with Sesko, who replaced Matheus Cunha, who had been ineffective, a charge that could be levelled at all United's attacking players on this occasion.\n\nIt was through his introduction of Zirkzee for full-back Diogo Dalot eight minutes from time where the risk and reward element came.\n\nCarrick switched to a back three and pushed men forward.\n\nHe knew there was a chance of conceding a second. It didn't happen, thanks to two superb saving tackles from another substitute, Leny Yoro, and a Senne Lammens save.\n\nIt meant as the clocked ticked past five minutes of injury-time played of the seven added, Carrick's side still had a chance. Sesko's brilliant finish ensured they did not head home empty handed.\n\n\"It's always worth it to try and get something out of the game,\" said Carrick of his substitution.\n\n\"We all want the perfect kind of performance, to be the best we can be.\n\n\"Sometimes it doesn't quite happen, but it doesn't mean you give up.\n\n\"Obviously we went for it, with three at the back and the rest all attacking basically to try and find that goal. That's the way we should do it.\"\n\nIt's an attitude straight out of the Sir Alex Ferguson playbook. He was always prepared to gamble in order to get a desired outcome and felt it was why he enjoyed so many late successes in his stellar career.\n\nAn 87th-minute winner against Arsenal, a 90th-minute winner against Fulham, and now a 95th-minute equaliser against West Ham.\n\nCarrick is pleased with 13 points out of 15 from his first block of games.\n\nAs he regroups before the next run of three matches, he will be just as delighted at the spirit and never-say-die attitude that helped to get them.\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Warning: This article contains discussion around suicide and depression.\n\nFormer Great Britain rugby league player Josh Jones has revealed he came close to taking his own life as a result of what he says are the effects of head injuries sustained while playing the sport.\n\nHaving retired in 2023 because of concussion-related issues, he was then diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) aged 31.\n\nThe degenerative brain disease is linked to repeated blows to the head and causes an increased risk of mental illness.\n\nJones - who made 246 Super League appearances for a number of clubs - is among the youngest and highest-profile claimants in a concussion lawsuit against rugby league authorities.\n\nIn his first interview since quitting the game, the former international second row told BBC Sport he considered suicide during his playing career.\n\n\"It breaks my heart to share this, but the day before the start of a season, I was contemplating ending my life, and that is how dark it got,\" he said.\n\n\"I sat there for hours contemplating [it] because I didn't like the person I was becoming. I felt a burden to my family.\n\n\"It was awful, and the scariest thing was, that evening [my wife] Olivia managed to calm me down and bring me home… and I played the following day.\"\n\nJones says he developed various symptoms after being regularly concussed during training and matches.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Sport from Malaysia, where he and his family now live, he said: \"I noticed that if I was doing simple tasks, like making my children a bottle of water, trying to pour it and trying to steady my hand, putting a card in the card machine, putting the keys in the door, I just couldn't stop my shaking,\" he said.\n\n\"And that's when things progressively started to get worse; headaches, brain fog, neck pain, eye pain… I'm sensitive to light and to noise, anxiety, depression.\n\n\"The scariest thing I find is being unable to regulate my emotions. That terrifies me. I cope with it by just taking myself away. It's been at the detriment sometimes of our marriage and me being a father and as a friend. I very much isolate myself.\n\n\"I would never let my children play, and that's a really sad thing.\"\n\nJones' wife Olivia told BBC Sport that the changes in her husband's personality were \"very gradual at first\" but became \"impossible to ignore\".\n\n\"He went from being confident, energetic, and present to being withdrawn, irritable, forgetful - and he just seemed to be constantly in pain,\" she said.\n\n\"And he often complained about suffering with headaches, brain fog, and anxiety, and it became quite scary for me.\"\n\nJones - who won three caps for Great Britain in 2019 - says he was diagnosed with probable stage 2 CTE in July 2024, after he had finished playing.\n\nThe degenerative brain disease can only be diagnosed definitively after death, and has been linked to dementia.\n\n\"Being told that someone could actually see me and support me and was listening to me, it was just relief, because for so long I'd just been told there's nothing,\" he added.\n\n\"What the governing body was providing for us as players wasn't, in my opinion, good enough, because there's so many players told there's nothing wrong with them.\n\n\"I think there needs to be an independent regulatory body for brain health, not just in rugby league, but throughout sport.\n\n\"My neurologist has said I'm at high risk now of further problems. It scares the life out of me what I put my body through and what's to come.\n\n\"It's heartbreaking, but the hardest thing for me is my children. When I was able to play on a trampoline with them, play football with them in the garden, I loved being a dad.\n\n\"And I almost feel like that, to the full extent, has been taken away from me, because right now I can't do those things, and I've got to explain to my children why.\"\n\nJones and other claimants in the concussion lawsuit argue that the Rugby Football League (RFL) was negligent in failing to take reasonable action to protect them from serious brain injuries.\n\nThey also claim that the organisation should have established and implemented rules on the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of actual or suspected concussive injuries. The governing body denies liability.\n\nWhen asked why he decided to join the legal action, Jones said: \"I've seen a lot of fans questioning the integrity of players, and saying that they knew the risks.\n\n\"I knew I'd have sore shoulders, a bad back, sore knees, maybe arthritis, those sort of physical things. I never knew that I would be left like this - and be living with this neurological damage that the game's given me.\n\n\"For me, it's not the game, it's the governance of the game that's the problem. And to add insult to injury, to be abandoned from the sport - it's not right. The governing body has failed to protect its players, and something needs to be done.\n\n\"I know it's not just me that's suffering. When I retired, I had lots of former team-mates reach out to me and ask me, 'what care have you got, because I'm suffering with the same symptoms as you'.\"\n\nJones says he believes that \"a lack of protocols\" made his symptoms progress.\n\nAfter retirement, Jones tried to forge a career in the financial sector, and then in his father-in-law's demolition business, but said he \"couldn't deal with the high-stress environment or the hours\" and had to \"isolate myself in dark rooms for hours\".\n\n\"It was just another nightmare,\" he said. \"So, right now, I don't do anything. I'm not employed. In a sense, I can't do anything because I can't work a nine-to-five.\n\n\"I need daily treatment. So we had to sell our home to be able to afford to come to the Far East to get cheaper treatment. We're looking to head to New Zealand.\n\n\"I'm speaking to neurologists over there who have got a different approach, who are recommended by other players who are going through this.\n\n\"Being proactive in trying to slow that transition down, because early-onset dementia, that's a very realistic possibility for me. So is Parkinson's, epilepsy.\n\n\"We're just trying to find some help. It has been the hardest time of our lives.\"\n\nOlivia added that watching her husband struggle after he had retired was \"a harsh reality to me as it was 'oh gosh, this is your life now. This isn't just the impact of playing week in, week out. You have now got brain damage'\".\n\n\"We got to a point in England where there was just no quality of life,\" she added.\n\n\"He didn't leave the house, he completely isolated himself. And obviously, I was scared to leave him on his own. I didn't know what to do and how to help him.\"\n\nIn a statement, the RFL said that it \"takes player safety and welfare extremely seriously and it is always extremely sad to hear of any health difficulties experienced by former players\".\n\n\"Rugby League as a sport invests significantly into scientific research, and continues to evolve its approach to help best prevent and manage concussion injuries.\n\n\"As such the sport has never been safer in this regard. The RFL has developed a clear action plan including a target to reduce concussions across the sport by 30% and is on track to meet these targets.\n\n\"Significant help and assistance is given to former professional players through charity provider Rugby League Cares, [which] supports a comprehensive transition programme supporting players during and post their career, including education and hardship grants.\n\n\"A Brain Health Fund has been established offering access to specialist counselling and care - which has provided support to more than 40 former players and their families.\"\n\nSolicitor Richard Boardman of Rylands Garth, the firm representing the claimants, said: \"Josh's problems still stick out, because he should be in the prime of his life.\n\n\"Josh has been so brave to discuss this publicly and our hearts go out to those who are suffering in silence.\"\n\nIn December, after five years of legal arguments, claimants in the litigation across both rugby league and union were refused permission to appeal against a decision ordering them to provide all of their medical records to the defendants.\n\nIf you have been affected by the issues raised in this article, help and support is available via BBC Action Line.",
