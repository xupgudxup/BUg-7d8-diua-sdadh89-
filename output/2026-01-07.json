    "fullText": "Manchester United are currently preparing for life after Ruben Amorim, with the Portuguese receiving his marching orders on Monday.\n\nCurrent United U18 boss and former midfielder Darren Fletcher has been placed in charge until INEOS can find a suitable replacement.\n\nThe plan is to hire an interim till the end of the current campaign, before trying to bring someone in permanently over the summer, as there will be a larger pool of options to choose from.\n\nTreble winner and former United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is reportedly the favourite to take over temporarily, with INEOS even meeting the Norwegian to discuss the possibility.\n\nInterestingly, as per Talksport, the ex-Besiktas boss is keen to be added to the list of permanent targets, provided he does well during his time in the hot seat.\n\nHis appointment has the backing of several superstars in the squad, including skipper Bruno Fernandes and former captain Harry Maguire. Both were brought to the club by the 52-year-old.\n\nInterestingly, pundits and ex-players like Rio Ferdinand and Gary Neville have also thrown their weight behind the appointment.\n\n“Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is inching closer to a sensational return to Manchester United, talkSPORT understands.\n\n“Former Red Devils player and manager Solskjaer is in advanced talks to become United’s interim head coach for the rest of the season.\n\n“Solskjaer has the support of several first-team players including captain Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire. It is thought fellow club legends including Rio Ferdinand and Gary Neville have also thrown their backing behind their ex-teammate.\n\n“The Norwegian fans’ favourite hopes if he does well then he would be considered for the job full-time.”\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer had guided the club to third and second-place finishes in the Premier League, the first time the club managed back-to-back top-four finishes post Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement.\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "title": "Who should Ravens hire to replace John Harbaugh? With Lamar Jackson, Ravens have a luxury their counterparts don't",
    "description": "\"The jobs this cycle all lack QBs like normal so he's definitely the top QB and offense available for any coach,\" one NFC exec told Yahoo Sports. An AFC assistant added: \"Any scheme fits him.\"",
    "fullText": "When the Cleveland Browns and Las Vegas Raiders interview head coaches in the coming weeks, they know the most important question they must answer: How will we identify and develop a young quarterback?\n\nWhen the New York Giants and Tennessee Titans interview head coaches, they, too, know the crux: First-round quarterbacks Jaxson Dart and Cam Ward need molding and development. The quarterback hopeful for each club is in the house. But how will he grow?\n\nShakeup at the top of the Atlanta Falcons and Arizona Cardinals will similarly require answers on a position with major question marks in 2026 and beyond.\n\nThese answers need not all come via offensive head coaches during a hiring cycle riper with defensive candidates than offensive. And in many successful franchises, including the reigning Super Bowl champions, the head coach’s primary responsibility is not to call offensive plays.\n\nBut when teams front young quarterbacks or face questions at quarterback, the pressure to find the offensive panacea sharpens. Coaching searches often skew accordingly.\n\nSo the Baltimore Ravens hold a clear advantage.\n\nBecause as they announced Tuesday night that 18-year head coach John Harbaugh was “relieved of his duties,” the Ravens are the lone team currently looking for a head coach that is not simultaneously searching to clarify their answer at quarterback.\n\nRecruiting coaches while two-time MVP Lamar Jackson is under contract is a luxury.\n\nSure, plenty will argue that just as the Ravens become the most attractive of seven NFL openings and counting, Harbaugh immediately became the most attractive candidate when he hit the market. That doesn’t mean the decision should be baffling. With a Super Bowl-winning coach and an MVP-winning quarterback, it should not be surprising if each believes he has the answers to future success. And if those answers don’t align, a time comes for a change.\n\nBut as the Ravens look for a coach who will end their 13-year Super Bowl drought, they won’t need as strong an emphasis on developing a quarterback.\n\n[Get more Ravens news: Baltimore team feed]\n\nThat could allow them, should they want, to select the best overall candidate first. Their ceiling will immediately be high.\n\n“We have so much talent on this team, and it's just disappointing that we're not able to be the team that's able to execute and win games when we need to win games,” fullback Patrick Ricard said this week. “As long as we have Lamar Jackson, I feel like this team can win a Super Bowl.”\n\nA minority of coaches and executives across the league will argue that a coach in the Shanahan and McVay systems may prefer a more in-structure passer to build their offense around.\n\nBut more often, as the surprise of Harbaugh’s dismissal hit Tuesday, league voices understood the new pecking order of openings.\n\n“The jobs this cycle all lack QBs like normal so he’s definitely the top QB and offense available for any coach,” one NFC executive told Yahoo Sports.\n\nAn AFC assistant added of Jackson: “Any scheme fits him.”\n\nJackson has shown that in eight seasons since the Ravens selected him with the 32nd pick of the 2018 NFL Draft. He’s earned four Pro Bowl berths, three All-Pro honors and two MVP awards while winning 76 of 107 regular-season starts.\n\nIn aggregate, Jackson has completed 64.8% of his passes for 22,608 yards and 187 passing touchdowns to 56 interceptions. His 102.2 career passer rating and 8.25 air yards per attempt currently hold the all-time career records, per Pro Football Reference.\n\nAnd those numbers don’t even include Jackson’s additional 6,522 yards and 35 touchdowns rushing.\n\nHis health has been inconsistent at times, Jackson most recently missing four games and about half of another this season with hamstring and back injuries. But while healthy, he thrived. Consider his Week 18 return from a back injury in Pittsburgh with the AFC North title on the line. While the Ravens lost on a walk-off missed field-goal attempt Sunday night, Jackson completed 11 of 18 passes for 238 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nHe activated another level in the fourth quarter, with 50- and 64-yard go-ahead touchdown passes to receiver Zay Flowers. The first came despite two defenders seeming to have Jackson wrapped up. Jackson was unfazed.\n\nInsane sack escape and 50-yard TD from Lamar Jackson. \n\nRavens 17, Steelers 13.pic.twitter.com/mgwAU6YIQG\n\n— Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) January 5, 2026\n\n“Shoot — I cut a nose guard loose, and he somehow slipped out of it and threw the ball [50] yards for a touchdown,” center Tyler Linderbaum said. “That's the kind of ability he has. So, he’s fun to play for. [He’s an] ultra competitor, and any time that ball is snapped to him, and it's in his hands, you know something electrifying can happen.”\n\n“The most electrifying player there is in this game.”\n\nAs reports of tension between Jackson and Harbaugh built this season, Jackson was asked last Thursday if he had a good relationship with Harbaugh.\n\n“Yes, I believe so,” he said. “I don’t know where the noise came from. I don’t know where the noise came from.”\n\nAfter the Ravens’ 26-24 loss Sunday, Jackson was asked about Harbaugh again.\n\nDid he want to see Harbaugh as his head coach next season?\n\n“You’re asking me about next year,” Jackson said. “I’m so caught up in what just happened tonight. I can't focus on that right now, I just told you. Like he asked me, ‘Are you stunned?’\n\n“I’m stunned right now, and I'm still trying to process what's going on. I know we lost, but what the ... you know?”\n\nSure, the emotions of the season’s sudden ending were fresh as Jackson’s Herculean fourth quarter wasn’t enough to advance to a sixth playoff berth in eight years. But Jackson was not the first player to receive a question about his coach’s future at season’s end. He would not have been the first to endorse a leader after a loss, especially one 18 years into his tenure with the organization with a Lombardi Trophy to his name and an AFC championship game berth in partnership with Jackson.\n\nHarbaugh issued his own statement, curiously including a smiley-face emoji as he said goodbye with “disappointment certainly, but more with GRATITUDE & APPRECIATION.”\n\nIs John Harbaugh the first NFL coach to include a smiley face in his statement about being fired? pic.twitter.com/NhHouUIL0C\n\n— Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) January 6, 2026\n\nThe Ravens' coaching search, as team owner Steve Bisciotti said in a statement, begins. Their ability to move quickly on top defensive candidates including the Los Angeles Chargers’ Jesse Minter, Los Angeles Rams’ Chris Shula and Houston Texans’ Matt Burke could prove to be an asset.\n\n“That’s a dream backfield to have Lamar and Derrick [Henry] and to play with those guys,” Ricard said. “I feel like, as long as they're here, this team has a shot — no matter who else is playing.”",

    "description": "The John R.",
    "fullText": "The John R. Wooden Award will celebrate it's 50th anniversary this season. Leading up to the award ceremony on April 10, 2026, The Sporting Tribune in partnership with the Wooden Award and the Los Angeles Athletic Club will highlight past winners of the Wooden Award and the Legends of Coaching Award.\n\nEvery blue moon a player comes along that will have you believing that every time he takes a shot its going in. “Jimmer” Fredette was one of those players.\n\nJames Taft Fredette, nicknamed “Jimmer” by his mother, was born February 25, 1989 in Glens Falls, New York, and was drawn to sports at a very early age. Older brother TJ helped “Jimmer” hone his skills early on as the two regularly played with TJ’s older friends in the family's backyard. \"He was the most determined, competitive four-year-old I had ever seen,” the elder once recalled.\n\nFredette was ranked among the nation's top high school shooting guards by ESPN.com and became Glens Falls High School's all-time leading scorer, ranking 16th on New York's all-time scoring list with 2,404 points.  He was named First-Team All-State by the New York State Sportswriters Association and the Times Union as a junior and senior, and in his senior season he led the then-Indians to a 25–2 record and a Class A State Championship game appearance.\n\nDespite his high school accolades Fredette, in many ways, went unnoticed by many of the nation’s top basketball programs, receiving a modest 12 scholarship offers before choosing to attend his sister's alma mater, BYU in Provo, Utah.\n\nAs a true freshman he played in all 35 games for the Cougars, helping them post a 27–8 record and capture the Mountain West Conference regular season title. He averaged 18.5 minutes per contest, and was the team's fifth-leading scorer at 7.0 points, while adding 1.7 assists and 1.1 rebounds per game.\n\nFredette played in all 33 games his sophomore season (2008-09), starting 32 of them, but this time around he was second on the team in scoring (16.2), three-point field goal percentage (.382), three-point makes (52), and free throw percentage (.847), and first in steals (1.5) and assists (4.1). Rightly so, his productivity earned him First-Team All-Mountain West Conference honors.\n\nAfter a stellar junior year that saw him break the MWC Tournament overall single-game and single game free throw records, Fredette considered forgoing his senior season and entering the NBA Draft. Expected to be picked late in the first round, however, he decided to stay at BYU and play his fourth year.\n\nHe posted two dozen 30-point, six 40-point, and a career-high 52 point night (senior year) in his four years with the Cougars, and for his overall body of work, Fredette was named the unanimous 2011 National Player of the Year, earning the coveted John R. Wooden Award. He was also took home the Best Male College Athlete ESPY Award that year.\n\nIn March 2011 Fredette broke BYU's career scoring record, previously held by Danny Ainge, in the semifinals of the Mountain West Conference Championship Tournament. He also set the school's single-game scoring record with a career-high 52-point performance against New Mexico, whom the Cougars fell to twice during the regular season.\n\nIn addition to claiming conference Player of the Year honors he was also among the final ten candidates for the Bob Cousy Award, given to college basketball’s top point guard.\n\n“I loved my time at BYU,” he once said of his four years in Provo. “It was an unbelievable experience with the fans, and the people that I have met, I have lifelong relationships still.”\n\nHe was subsequently selected with the 10th overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft by the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nFredette played for several NBA and NBA Development League teams, as well as internationally. He was the CBA Most Valuable Player in 2017, and was a member of the Greek Basketball League's championship team in 2020.\n\nCurrently Fredette is Managing Director for USA Basketball’s 3x3 National Team. He began competing in 3x3 basketball in 2022 and won two gold medals and one silver in international play. In 2024, Fredette represented Team USA at the 2024 Summer Olympics as a member of the first USA Basketball 3x3 Men's National Team to compete at the Olympics.\n\nAt the end of the day, “Jimmermania” (in its heyday) rivaled that of “Linsanity,” and Fredette will deservedly be remembered for it.\n\nIn his own words, “Basketball will come and go, but the person you are will always remain.”",

    "description": "Texas A&M beat Auburn 90-88 on Tuesday night after a review determined that a buzzer-beater didn't quite get off in time.",
    "fullText": "KeShawn Murphy thought he had hit a ridiculous deep buzzer-beater to lift Auburn past Texas A&M on Tuesday night.\n\nMurphy, with Auburn down by two points, caught an inbounds pass with just 0.6 seconds left on the clock, turned and fired. His shot was perfect, and sparked a massive celebration at Neville Arena. The shot looked like it was one of the first truly great buzzer-beaters of the college basketball season, several months before March even hit.\n\nBut unfortunately for Murphy and the Tigers, a review from the officials determined that the release was just a little too late. Murphy didn’t get the shot off in time, and the points were called off. That gave the Aggies the 90-88 road win, and left them celebrating in front of a stunned arena instead.\n\nWILD ENDING 🤯 \n\nThis supposed buzzer-beater from Auburn was overturned after review to give Texas A&M the win. pic.twitter.com/oxjZEHlWGH\n\n— SEC Network (@SECNetwork) January 7, 2026\n\n\"I don't have a clear understanding still,\" Auburn coach Steven Pearl said, via WSFA12's Rosie Langello-Hodgens. \"I still gotta gather more information and get an understanding as to what their determination was ... Just from the angles that I saw, it looked like the ball was out of his hands on the red light, on the scoreboard that we were looking at. But I would imagine that they had a different angle they were looking at to determine the ball wasn't out of his hands.\"\n\nPearl had a conversation with the SEC after the game, and he was seen meeting with athletic director John Cohen and officials on the court well after speaking with reporters.\n\nTexas A&M rallied from a 16-point hole to grab the win over the Tigers, which got them to 12-3 on the season and kept them a perfect 2-0 in SEC play. Pop Isaacs led the way with 21 points off the bench after he shot 7-of-12 from the field, and Jacari Lane added 17 points and seven rebounds. The Aggies have now won five straight entering Saturday's game with Oklahoma.\n\nKeyshawn Hall led Auburn with 32 points and 12 rebounds in the loss, and Kevin Overton finished with 16 points. Murphy had eight points and eight rebounds. The Tigers have now lost four of their last six, and fell to 9-6 on the season — which is the first under Pearl, who took over for his father, longtime coach Bruce Pearl, this past offseason. They’ll head into Saturday’s game with No. 15 Arkansas without an SEC win looking to avoid what would be the program’s first three-game losing skid since 2023.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams have been one of the best teams in the entire league this season, and it's no accident.

In the early 2000s, thanks to players like Kurt Warner, Isaac Bruce, Tory Holt, and Marshall Faulk, they were deemed 'The Greatest Show on Turf'.\n\nNow, over 20 years later, Los Angeles once again boasts one of the top offensive units in the league.\n\nWith the numbers that came out after the regular season, it has people wondering if this is one of the best offensive units of all time.\n\nIt's not 'The Greatest Show on Turf', but it sure looks close.

    "fullText": "University of Utah basketball coach Alex Jensen has consistently reminded his players to “control what you can control” in his first season leading the program he once starred for.\n\nDon’t let the results halt the progression — or let outside factors become a deterrent to development.\n\nThat applies to their latest effort, when the Runnin’ Utes lost by 19 to No. 1 Arizona last Saturday in their Big 12 opener.\n\nThe Wildcats stormed out to a 14-2 lead, then used their balance to overwhelm Utah.\n\nThe Utes (8-6, 0-1 Big 12) had their moments — like when they were able to fight back from an early 17-point hole and cut their deficit to single digits four times in the first half — before falling in a game where they were heavy underdogs.\n\n“There were a lot of things myself and our team could learn from them, because they scored 97 points, and — I said this after the game — but they didn’t have a guy over 20 (points). You never saw them celebrate, get too high or too low. Very professional. You know, give credit to them,” Jensen said.\n\n“Playing a team as good as that, I think it helped us emphasize what we’ve been trying to get across to them all along, that control what you can control. And there’s mistakes, whether you play Arizona or anybody, that you shouldn’t make.”\n\nThe experience was valuable for a Utah team with 12 newcomers — only junior forward Keanu Dawes played for the Utes in Big 12 action last season. Fifth-year forward James Okonkwo also has experience in the league — he started out his college career at West Virginia.\n\nFor freshmen like forward Kendyl Sanders, guard Obomate Abbey and forward Ibi Traore, it was their first real taste of the physicality that the conference is known for.\n\nIt wasn’t their first taste of major conference ball — the Utes had multiple nonconference games against teams from the SEC, ACC and Big Ten — but it gave Utah its first glance of what the 18-game conference grind will be like.\n\n”It’s just very physical,” Sanders said of Big 12 play. “I’d say it’s probably the best basketball team we ever played — just experience, the physicality, the shots they take, how hard they were on the floor. I mean, it was a lot, but I think I’m ready for it. I’m excited for the (rest of) the season.”\n\nJensen was complimentary of the kind of program that Wildcats coach Tommy Lloyd has built in Arizona. Not only do the Wildcats not have to rely on any one player — Arizona has one of the most balanced rosters in the country — they also have three starting freshmen who contribute heavily on a nightly basis.\n\n“I think it’s really valuable for our freshmen to get the experience, because I think the fastest way to improve is to play basketball. … (Arizona does) a great job of blending (together), start three freshmen, and give them credit, all those guys play well together,” Jensen said.\n\nFor Utah, who’s had some injury issues that have impacted their rotation, the hope is that the challenges will pay off in the long run.\n\n“For us, you’d love to have the eight-, nine-man rotation and stay healthy and have a couple young guys you bring up,” Jensen said. “With injuries and other things, we are doing things we necessarily hadn’t planned on. But again, I think everybody’s trying to figure out the best way to build their roster.”\n\nFortunately for Utah, the next game isn’t against a top-25 program. On Wednesday, the Utes will face Colorado (11-3, 1-0 Big 12), who is coming off a six-point road win over Arizona State to start Big 12 play.\n\nThe Buffaloes, to a lesser extent than Arizona, are efficient on offense — they average 86.6 points per game. Colorado has five players who average double-figures, paced by guard Isaiah Johnson (15.9 points, 3.0 rebounds, 2.4 assists per game) and Barrington Hargress (13.6 points, 4.8 assists).\n\nDefensively, the Utes and Buffaloes are averaging similar numbers. Colorado is 14th in the Big 12 in scoring defense, giving up 78.2 points per game. Utah is one spot behind, allowing 79.8 points per contest.\n\n“They’re well-coached. They’re big, they’re versatile. They have bigs that can handle the ball and they can initiate the offense. They’ll throw a little twist in, but they’re in every game,” Jensen said.\n\nFor Jensen and his team, though, the focus isn’t as much on what the opponent does well. It’s on focusing each day as the season progresses and helping the players develop — not just for this season, but for the future.\n\nAnd if that formula goes well, it could end in victory — like it did in their first win over a major conference opponent, Ole Miss, back in November.\n\n“It goes back to us and the things that we can control — playing with the pass, not getting beat in transition or on the boards, and I think we’ll have a really good chance. And then, limit the turnovers. Sounds simple, repetitive, but that’s it,” Jensen said.\n\nUtah, which has a dearth of front-court depth, is adding a 6-foot-10 walk-on center to the roster.\n\nColin McHaney joins the program as a midseason addition, as a potential option to add some minutes in the post when/if he gets up to speed.\n\nMcHaney hails from Milton, Georgia, where he played for Milton High and Blessed Trinity Catholic High. The past two years, he’s been a part of a region championship team, and as a sophomore, he helped lead Blessed Trinity Catholic High to the state quarterfinals.",

    "fullText": "Get German Football News coverage of the Bundesliga players participating in the 2025 AFCON returns! In this piece, we’ll be taking a look at the 11 Bundesliga professionals still active as the African continental championship enters the quarterfinal phase. There’s some catching up to do as we chronicle each player’s progress through the tournament.\n\nGerman football is represented in six of the eight nations still alive in the competition. Algeria, Cote d’Ivoire, Cameroon, Morocco, Senegal, and Mali all have Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga players chasing the continental crown. Only Egypt and Nigeria don’t feature German footballing representatives this time around.\n\nFor Africa fans, the pre-Christmas AFCON has taken some getting used to. The tourney nevertheless provided us with plenty of great football and intriguing storylines. Attendance figures have been wonderfully pleasing, even more so after it was revealed that fans are being allowed in free-of-charge after kickoff.\n\nMost of us Africa lovers find ourselves saddened by the news that, after the next two AFCONs in 2027 and 2028, this awesome competition will only be held every four years. That’s all the more reason for us to celebrate what we have while it lasts.\n\nThe 2019 AFCON Champions are through to the quarters after besting Samuel Essende’s Congo DR 1-0 in added extra time during the Round-of-16. All four Algerian Bundesliga representatives played important roles in their team’s successful tournament thus far. Unsurprisingly enough, Bayer 04 Leverkusen jewel Ibrahim Maza proved the brightest of the desert nations lights. Maza struck twice during the group phase and earned man-of-the-match honors in the one group stage fixture in which he didn’t score.\n\nVladimir Petkovic’s north Africans now prepare to face Nigeria’s famous “Super Eagles” on Saturday in what shapes up to be an “instant classic”. Like Algeria, Nigeria steamrolled through the group phase on maximum points. The Nigerians (sadly devoid of any Bundesliga representatives this year) knocked out Stanley Ratifo’s Mozambique 4-0 in their Round-of-16 fixture. Former Bundesliga professionals Ademola Lookman (Leipzig) and Victor Osimhen (Wolfsburg) have both turned in beastly tournaments.\n\nThree goals apiece for Lookman and Osimhen!\n\nMaza didn’t start in the initial group stage fixture against Sudan, but did relieve Bundesliga colleague Fares Chaïbi directly at the half-hour-mark. The Berlin-native ended up scoring the 3-0 in the 85th minute. Though he neither scored a goal nor registered an assist in the narrow Round Two 1-0 victory over Burkina Faso, Maza directed the Algerian attack from the No. 10 slot. His four shots and four assisted shots earned him the man-of-the-match honors.\n\nMaza was genuinely unlucky not to score after out-deking his Leverkusen teammate Edmond Tapsoba in the 67th-minute and forcing a fantastic save out of Burkinabé keeper Herve Koffi. Maza revealed that he and Tapsoba prepared for some direct duels beforehand whilst speaking at the post-match press conference. The 20-year-old also lamented that he couldn’t turn his many chances into another goal.\n\nAll of that mattered little as Maza’s team officially booked passage to the knockouts with the win. Maza again worked the ten slot in the Round Three encounter against Equatorial Guinea. Just like in the first match, Maza netted the 3-0. This time, Petkovic’s squad went three goals up much earlier. Maza effectively wrapped matters up with his 32nd minute strike. The German-Algerian prodigy was subbed off early after another excellent start.\n\nIn the recently completed Round-of-16 win, Maza started as a striker alongside Mohamed Amoura in a 4-4-2. A decent 83-minute-shift saw him get two efforts on target. In a very tight affair, Maza produced the best chance of the entire first half. Unfortunately, his finish went wide of the mark in the 43rd-minute. An effort just before being subbed off in the 83rd was more harmless.\n\nChaïbi has featured in all four fixtures and started three. The SGE professional initially worked as a ten until Maza took over the position. Petkovic placed Chaïbi on the left flank beside Maza in the third group stage match. The placement worked perfectly as Maza set up Chaïbi for the 2-0 in the 25th minute. Working behind Maza in the 4-4-2 in the Congo DR knockout match, Chaïbi remained more inconspicuous.\n\nThe 23-year-old still cropped up in the 111th minute, testing Congo DR keeper Lionel Mpasi with an effort from the center. Chaïbi’s shot appeared to be the last bit of action in the match before Algeria’s Adil Boulbina averted a penalty shootout with a dramatic late winner in the 119th. Those who haven’t caught Boulbina’s powerful finish yet are advised to do so.\n\nThe resurgent BVB professional has absolutely done his job in three starts in which he went the full distance. Petkovic rested Bensebaini in the third group stage fixture against Equatorial Guinea; which happened to be the only match in which Algeria conceded a goal. Bensebaini remained especially strong in the air throughout the group phase, not losing a single aerial duel in his two 90-minute shifts. One can’t argue with three clean sheets.\n\nBensebaini was among the workhorses who kept the scoreline level against Congo DR. He contested a total of 28 duels on the ground and in the air. Over the course of 120 minutes, he accrued 99 touches and connected with 84 percent of his 77 passes. Dortmund will surely be keen to welcome Bensebaini back in this form, especially as they continue to beat back Chelsea’s loan recall right on Aarón Anselmino.\n\nWolfsburg’s leading scorer has registered an assist on one of Riyad Mahrez’s three tournament goals. He hasn’t scored himself yet, but has been very effective. The 25-year-old kept active offensively in all three of the matches in which he’s featured. Amoura came close to scoring with some of his seven tournament efforts on target and looked especially compelling working alongside Maza in the 4-4-2 Petkovic deployed in the last match.\n\nAs forecast in our GGFN preview section the two Bundesliga sensations on the Cote d’Ivoire roster are helping the 2015 and 2023 AFCON champs storm through this tournament. Emerse Faé’s Ivorians have Leipzig phenom Yan Diomande and Hoffenheim tactical wizard Bazoumana Touré directly to thank for their quarterfinal berth. The Bundesliga duo both scored in Cote d’Ivoire’s surprising 3-0 Round-of-16 win over a very strong Burkina Faso side.\n\nThe defending champs are set for a quarterfinal showdown with AFCON record champs Egypt on Saturday. The task shall prove a difficult one as Egypt’s former Bundesliga star Omar Marmoush is having an excellent tournament. Egypt stormed past Steve Mounie’s Benin with a 3-1 victory in added extra time to punch their ticket to the knockouts.\n\nIt’s just getting ridiculous. Why expend more words on this über-talented youngster with an amazing story? Don’t read about him. Watch him! Diomande started three of his nation’s four tournament fixtures, going the full 90 minutes in the first two rounds. He worked his socks off in the Round One 1-0 win over Mozambique on the left-hand-side of a 4-3-3. In the crazy 1-1 draw with Cameroon in Round Two, Diomande barely missed out on an assisted goal.\n\nInitially rested in the final group stage fixture against Gabon, Diomande came on very late during one of the craziest matches of the tournament. Cote d’Ivoire were trailing Gabon 1-2 when Diomande entered proceedings in the 82nd minute. Thanks in large part to his boundless energy (12 touches, four long dribbles, and five ground duel wins), the team was able to score two goals in the final six minutes and pull out 3-2 victory.\n\nDiomande and his right flank partner Amad Diallo Traoré of Manchester United have evolved into an unstoppable force as the competition progressed. Diomande assisted on Amad’s 1-0 in the 20th-minute of the Burkina Faso Round-of-16 encounter just completed this evening. Amad then returned the favor on Diomande’s 2-0 in 32nd-minute. The Burkinabé’s attempted to fight back bravely, but couldn’t get past the early insurmountable lead.\n\nOne of the best Bundesliga additions of the 2025 calendar year is simply having a rollicking tournament is simply having a rollicking tournament. Everything about this player glistens. Known as perhaps the most interesting and diverse tactical player in the entire Bundesliga, Touré showcases his skills here. The 19-year-old has only featured twice off the bench in the competition, yet has scored within scant minutes of his introduction on both occasions.\n\nTouré’s second goal of the tournament (this evening) was simply unreal. The fearless teenage talent literally picked up the ball in his own penalty area and sprinted across the entire pitch before supplying a flawless finish. Yowza. Once more, one must insist that the reader stop reading at this point. Go find a video of Touré’s virtuosity! Now!\n\nWe segue to another player whose breakout tournament was easy enough to forecast. The author knew Leverkusen Christian Kofane would light up the Dark Continent’s showpiece….and also stands by his (nonjudgmental) assertion that there’s no possible way that Kofane is only 19-years-old. Kofane has the 2017 AFCON champs kicking some serious ass with goals in his last two games.\n\nKofane scored the crucial 2-0 in Cameroon’s eventual 2-1 Round-of-16 victory over South Africa. The Indomitables now face a stern test in the quarters. Hosts Morocco block their path to the semis. If Kofane can once again prove the deciding factor, we’ll be talking much more about how this mega-talented youngster almost didn’t participate in this completion.\n\nFECAFOOT really pulled off something big here!\n\nAfter not appearing in the opening group stage fixture against Gabon, Kofane was among the subs who came agonizingly close to scoring in the Round Two 1-1 draw against Cote d’Ivoire. Cameroon trainer David Pagou liked what he saw from Kofane in his 17-minute relief shift in the second match and rewarded him with a start against Mozambique in Round Three. Kofane spearheaded the 4-2-3-1, going head-to-head against Chemie Leipzig’s Stanley Ratifo.\n\nCameroon’s ticket to the knockouts wasn’t in the greatest danger when the second half began with the game deadlocked at 1-1. Kofane still lifted his team above an unfortunate own-goal and past a potentially poor Round-of-16 seed with a sickly sweet solo effort on what would prove the match winner in the 55th minute. Serious involvement from Kofane in the Mozambique match! The Leverkusen man was involved in nine scoring chances!\n\nKofane’s second goal in the weekend knockout fixture also drove his team to a 2-1 victory. Kofane turned in another very strong performance in which he accrued way more touches than most center-forwards have business doing. Small wonder Germans absolutely love him. True to the German footballing spirit, Kofane never shies away from working the “deep drops”.\n\nHad a disallowed offside goal in the Cote d’Ivoire match not been disallowed, Kofane would have scored three consecutive 2-1 match-winners. Incredible!  Everyone in the Bundesrepublik remains excited to see where Kofane heads next. Most German footballing media sources aren’t missing the opportunity to re-post coverage of Kofane in his native country. Cameroon buzzes harder than the Bundesrepublik.\n\nWe’re witnessing greatness blossom here!\n\nThings have shaken out a little differently than expected for the hosts, at least with regard to the two Bundesliga players involved. For some reason, Stuttgart gem Bilal El Khannouss only appeared as a substitute during the first two group stage fixtures and sat out the third entirely. Meanwhile, Leverkusen flop Eliesse Ben Seghir has featured more regularly off the bench. There’s word that Ben Seghir struggles with injury, but El Khannouss appears fully fit.\n\nIn any event, after an excellent group phase, Morocco managed to squeak into the quarters with a narrow victory over German favorites Tanzania. El Khannouss’s Lions square off against Kofane’s Lions in a fabulous Friday quarterfinal offering. The hosts have great cause to worry. One anticipates that 120 minutes plus may be required to separate the two teams.\n\nEl Khannouss did exert his influence somewhat in his 14 minutes on the pitch in the tournament opener against Comoros. In a slightly longer shift against Mali in Round Two, the 21-year-old engaged in more duels and recorded an assisted shot on target. Unused in the third group stage, El Khannouss made up for it all with his first start of the competition in the Tanzania match.\n\nWorking on the right-hand-side of a crowded midfield 4-3-3, the Leicester City loanee accrued 88 touches and peeled off a brilliant effort on target in the 52nd-minute. One conjectures that, after such a performance, El Khannouss will start against Cameroon. He looked his usual spry and creative self. Stay tuned!\n\nNot too terribly much to report from the 20-year-old’s three relief shifts. Ben Seghir always entered when the game had already been decided. The only real piece of news concerns the fact that Moroccan trainer Walid Regragui recently stated that Ben Seghir had been struggling with a pubic bone injury for “over three months”. Leverkusen sporting director Simon Rolfes has denied this report.\n\nThe 2021 AFCON champs are indeed looking good after topping their group and easily manhandling Sudan in their Round-of-16 encounter. The “new look” Pape Thiaw Lions face the Malian Eagles in the first quarterfinal match due to kick off on Friday. Current Bayern loanee Nicolas Jackson and former Bayern flop Sadio Mané have both had excellent tournaments.\n\nA brace from Jackson in the opening round victory over Botswana ensured that the Terangans got off to an excellent start. Jackson also looked strong in the Round Two draw against Congo DR and registered an assist in the victory over Sudan. Jackson leads a weird looking 4-1-4-1 that, while at times choppy, succeeds in getting the job done.\n\nWe’ve a problem here. Namely, the fact that it remains common knowledge that Jackson is only in the Bundesliga for a brief stopover. Bayern have proudly bilked Chelsea into what (for them at least) is a low-cost short-term lease. German football lovers find it difficult to really get into the 24-year-old. He’s merely passing through.\n\nThe beloved “Aigles” are one Bundesliga player shorter now that Amadou Haidara’s transfer has been finalized. Mali bested Bundesliga-heavy Tunisia in a draining Round-of-16 penalty shootout on Day One of the knockouts. Eintracht Frankfurt trainer Dino Toppmöller has already confirmed that midfielder Elyes Skhiri will be granted a week’s worth of vacation in order to adequately recover from the ordeal.\n\nThe lone 2. Bundesliga representative of this subset only featured in the Tunisian match in the final ten minutes. Sissoko only managed to get booked and did not take a penalty. Haidara has been more influential for the West Africans in this tournament, as has former Stuttgart loanee El Bilal Touré. The former Bundesliga pro sunk the winning penalty in a shootout in which Augsburg profi Elias Saad was one of only two Tunisians who converted.",

    "fullText": "ST. LOUIS – When the Principia boys basketball team went 31-1 and capped off last season with a state championship it seemed like they had reached their peak, but they were just getting started.\n\nThe Panthers now at 10-1 this season have scheduled national competition on their way into the national spotlight.\n\n“You have to have the right type of mindset and these guys have bought in to each other,” head coach Jay Blossom told Fox 2 on Tuesday.\n\nFrom nationally ranked players to nationally ranked teams, the Panthers haven’t shied away from the competition.\n\n“People didn’t think that we would be ranked number two in the country and I honestly didn’t think we were either,” senior guard Quentin Coleman said.\n\nAccording to MaxPreps, Principia is the second-best high school basketball team in the country. The team played in the City of Palms classic in Florida where they beat previously #1 Wheeler High School.\n\n“So far we have performed at a high level and our name is out there, but when you’re name is out there all that means is that target is a whole lot bigger,” Blossom explained.\n\nThe target may be one of the biggest this weekend as the Panthers feature in the Highland Shootout where they will meet East St. Louis.\n\n“It should be epic,” Blossom said.\n\nIt’ll be a battle of the best small school in St. Louis versus the best big school.\n\n“Most of my family is over in East. St. Louis,” Coleman said. “We’ve been having talks in the group chat.”\n\n“It’s a really hyped-up game and it’s going to be a crazy environment,” junior Kingston Money said.\n\nThe Panthers are eager to grab St. Louis bragging rights but have their eye on an even bigger prize which would be another state championship.\n\n“It’s hard to go back-to-back and that’s what I’m trying to accomplish,” Coleman said. “I feel like I’m a winner and I have to prove that.”",

It was just such an easy transition to happen because he was already at Chelsea’s sister club, Strasbourg.\n\nRosenior has began work as Chelsea manager now, but he will not be in the dugout tonight for their game against Fulham – it seems that this game has just come too early for him to take charge of and it will be interim boss Calum McFarlane who will be taking this one, as he did the last game against Manchester City.\n\nAs you can see above, Chelsea posted the first image of Rosenior at Chelsea’s training ground at Cobham last night as he gets used to his new surroundings.\n\nThe new Blues boss will take charge of his first game at the weekend, which happens to be an FA Cup Third round tie against Charlton on Saturday night.\n\nChelsea fans haven’t exactly been excited by this appointment, but let’s hope that they can get behind Rosenior and Chelsea can attempt to move forward with some needed sustained success now.",

    "description": "The No. 9-ranked Stars bolstered their schedule and expanded their talent base in an effort to achieve the goal that's eluded them the last two years.",
    "fullText": "LANSING — For Lansing Community College’s women’s basketball program, the previous two seasons were a combination of wonder and winning, building and bonding. The rebirth of the Stars’ program under Megan Hudson has been an awesome story.\n\nBut it’s also twice finished in frustration and heartbreak, back-to-back 25-win seasons ending a win shy of the NJCAA Division II national tournament.\n\nAll you have to do is look at the schedule and the roster this season to know there’s one goal: Get to the national tournament.\n\n“100%. It’s eyes on the prize,” Hudson said, midway through her third season.\n\n“I mean, it’s everything,” said sophomore point guard Claire Tobias, from Holt.\n\nThe Stars are 11-2 entering Wednesday night’s home game against Jackson College (5:30 p.m., Gannon Gymnasium). Jackson beat them in the district championship two years ago. LCC then begins conference play at home Saturday against Glen Oaks Community College (1 p.m., Gannon Gymnasium).\n\nThe LCC men, also off to a good start (9-4), host Mott at 7:30 on Wednesday and Glen Oaks at 3 p.m. Saturday.\n\nThat non-conference record by the LCC women has been earned this season. Hudson challenged her team in ways she hadn’t the first two years — playing three straight ranked teams in three days at a tournament at St. Clair County in November, beating two of them and losing a competitive game to now-No. 2 Illinois Central, then playing at No. 6 Schoolcraft, losing by four, before winning three games at an event in Florida in December, including over No. 12 Parkland.\n\nAll of it has put the Stars firmly on the national radar, ranked No. 9 nationally in the latest poll, which came out Tuesday.\n\nIt’s the respect Hudson has been seeking. “Because I feel the basketball we’re playing is on that level,” she said.\n\n“I have been trying to figure out the formula for national competition, to continue to grow, to get to a space that we can make the national tournament and, when we get there, we can compete nationally,” Hudson continued. “And it was clearly articulated to me that you need to travel to play outside of your region and you have to play ranked teams.”\n\nShe was told that by fellow coaches and, not in so many words, by the NJCAA tournament selection committee, which didn’t give the Stars one of the few at-large bids when they fell to Schoolcraft last March in their district championship game.\n\nHudson also knew that she needed to challenge this particular team early, a squad with 10 freshmen.\n\n“I knew that I had a very young team coming in, a very, very talented young team coming in,” Hudson said, “and that they need to understand what that landscape looks like, and to play the best of the best and to be able to compete at that level.”\n\nHudson’s team still has a local flare to it — Tobias, sophomore post Ashlynn Putman (Mason), redshirt-sophomore Ivana McCollum (Waverly), along with freshmen guards Sophie Klinger (East Lansing) and Jocelyn Kotowicz (St. Johns) are all regular contributors, with Tobias and Putman starting all 13 games.\n\nBut Hudson’s recruiting reach has expanded significantly — to Detroit, Flint, Bay City, Berrien Springs, Kansas, Texas.\n\nThe foundation and culture built the last two seasons has made LCC an attractive destination and the recruiting pitch easier.\n\nFor example, transfer Destiny Ochs, a 5-foot-9 wing from Topeka, Kansas, found LCC on her own, first by poking around the NJCAA website.\n\n“Lansing stood out to me,” Ochs said. “I looked them up, and the school popped out to me. I could tell they're really focused on their education, they looked like they had a good basketball program they were building. And I just looked at their Twitter, too. And I saw that they're committing a lot more girls. It’s more of a diverse team than it was last year. So I was just really interested. I reached out from there.”\n\nHudson emailed her back the next day and the recruitment blossomed.\n\nFreshman power forward and center Aubreona Smith — affectionally known to her teammates as “Smitty” — met Hudson after one of her games at Berrien Springs. There were a number of coaches there to see her, but she and Hudson connected right away.\n\n“She stood out the most to me,” Smith said. “I feel like you should go somewhere you’re wanted and not just be a number.”\n\nShe liked that LCC had a psychology program and felt like home. And, “I like to win.”\n\nThis is no longer just a dream. Nor just a feel-good story. Hudson has something to sell, proof of concept, and can be choosy in who she recruits, as well.\n\nHer first two teams were talented in their own right. This one is deeper — 13 deep regularly.\n\n“I have easily seven different kids that could go off for 20 (points) on any given night,” Hudson said.\n\n“We have so many guards this year, they just love to run,” Tobias added. “We have so many people coming off the bench, if one person's tired, we have another one just as fast. We outrun everyone. I love that feeling, as someone who just loves to push the ball up (the court). … And Smitty coming in, her and Ash (Putman) being our bigs have been great.”\n\nSmith are Putman are part of a balanced scoring attack, with Putman leading the team at 11.3 points per game (an 8.2 rebounds), with Smith at 10.8 (and 7.8 rebounds). Armonie Smith, a 5-9 freshman guard from Flint, averages 11.2 points, with freshman guard Demi Bolton, who played at Ferndale, at 9.1 per game. Tobias averages 7.6 points and team-leading 2.4 assists. Freshman Georgia Kuyers — who followed former LCC star Kara Bartels (now at CMU) from Zeeland West — is averaging 6.7 rebounds in 17.3 minutes. Nine players are averaging 15 minutes or more per game, with Putnam and Tobias the only two over 20.\n\n“I think our athleticism and the fact that we can go so deep in the roster, that's been a little bit different. … That's helped us this year,” Putman said.\n\nAlso helping — even when it doesn’t feel like it: the travel and the schedule.\n\n“I think it was necessary,” Putman said. “It was hard at times, and obviously we dropped a couple (games) to the Illinois (Central) team and Schoolcraft. But playing the high-caliber teams early and getting a feel for that early, I think is beneficial for us when we go down the road and play at regionals and nationals.”\n\n“We we feel like we have figured out the recipe a bit on getting the girls ready for what that's going to feel like in a different way than we have in the past,” Hudson said, “what it feels like to play multiple games back to back, what it feels like to be in high-pressure situations and make better decisions, and you don't get that if you're not playing the best.”\n\nAs the goal has become more focused, Hudson and her staff have tried to make sure this is still an inviting program and an atmosphere that isn’t entirely about winning under pressure. For example, they take dance breaks during workouts — where one player teaches the rest of the team a dance. They give each other verbal flowers after every practice. It’s still a mom and pop operation, too — literally. Hudson’s mother, Pat Feehery, buys the team snacks.\n\nAt the community college level, there’s always a ton a newness. Maintaining culture and leadership comes down to the staff and your sophomores.\n\n“I've been very, very pleased with our (group),” Hudson said, also happy that her team posted a 3.3 first-semester GPA, the highest in her time with the program. “The sophomores have been outstanding, major anchors to what we're doing here. The freshmen, to have the mentality they have, is fun to see.”\n\nContract Graham Couch at gcouch@lsj.com.

    "fullText": "The Vitality Stadium prepares for another high-profile North London visit on Wednesday night as Bournemouth host a stuttering Tottenham Hotspur side.\n\nAndoni Iraola’s men enter the midweek fixture looking to snap an 11-match winless streak. Unfortunately, this represents the longest barren run in the club’s history. Despite a spirited performance against Arsenal, a 3-2 defeat left the Cherries in 15th place.\n\nNow, they face a Tottenham team led by Thomas Frank. However, the manager faces mounting pressure following recent poor results. Recently, a goalless draw at Brentford followed a “painful” 1-1 home stalemate against Sunderland. Currently, the Lilywhites sit 13th, just four points ahead of their hosts. Therefore, Spurs arrive in Bournemouth knowing the high stakes involved. Crucially, dropped points could see them slide down a congested mid-table. This follows Chelsea’s dramatic 1-1 draw at Manchester City on Sunday. Consequently, the European places remain highly competitive.\n\nDate: Wednesday, 7 January 2026\n\nVenue: Vitality Stadium, Bournemouth\n\nLast Meeting: Tottenham Hotspur 0–1 Bournemouth, 30 August 2025\n\nUnfortunately, the Cherries suffered a major blow regarding Justin Kluivert. Specifically, the forward requires surgery on a left knee injury sustained against Arsenal. Now, he joins a lengthy injury list alongside Tyler Adams, Ryan Christie, and Ben Gannon-Doak.\n\nPositively, teenage defender Veljko Milosavljević returned to training. Currently, he ranks as the closest long-term absentee to a return. Surprisingly, Antoine Semenyo expects to be available for his potential final appearance. This comes despite an agreed £65m move to Manchester City.\n\nRegrettably, Thomas Frank confirmed that star winger Mohammed Kudus “most likely” misses out. This follows a thigh injury he sustained against Sunderland. Worryingly, the recent sale of Brennan Johnson compounds this absence. Consequently, Spurs look thin on the right flank.\n\nHowever, Xavi Simons becomes available for selection again. Notably, he returns after serving a three-match suspension. Meanwhile, Dominic Solanke, James Maddison, and Dejan Kulusevski remain out. Additionally, the Africa Cup of Nations claims Yves Bissouma and Pape Matar Sarr.\n\nCurrently, Bournemouth struggle with midweek woes. Specifically, they remain winless in their last seven Premier League games played midweek. However, the Cherries have the chance to complete a historic league double over Tottenham. This follows their 1-0 win in North London earlier this season. Remarkably, they proved themselves as entertainers this term. In fact, they scored at least twice in eight games they failed to win. Finally, teenager Junior Kroupi remains a bright spot. Currently, he leads all teenagers in the league with six goals.\n\nSpurs are also on a 10-match winless midweek run, a record Thomas Frank will be desperate to break. Despite their overall inconsistency, the Lilywhites have shown impressive road resilience, keeping five clean sheets in 10 away games this season—more than they managed in the entirety of the 2024-25 campaign. A tactical shift is evident under Frank; Tottenham are averaging just 9.9 shots per game, the first time they have averaged fewer than 11 per match since records began in 1997.\n\nBournemouth predicted XI: Petrovic; Jimenez, Hill, Senesi, Truffert; Tavernier, Scott; Semenyo, Cook, Brooks; Evanilson\n\nTottenham Hotspur predicted XI: Vicario; Spence, Romero, Van de Ven, Davies; Gray, Bentancur; Simons, Bergvall, Tel; Richarlison\n\nIn the UK, the match will be broadcast live on Sky Sports Golf, with coverage starting at 18:00 GMT ahead of the 19:30 kick-off.\n\nRead more- Semenyo medical booked as Man City eye next transfer target\n\nSee Also- Enzo Maresca breaks silence on Chelsea exit with farewell message\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Two of the Premier League’s surprise European contenders go head-to-head on Wednesday night as seventh-placed Brentford host Sunderland at the Gtech Community Stadium.\n\nThe Bees have defied early-season scepticism under Keith Andrews, mounting a serious challenge for European places following a dominant 4-2 win over Everton. Currently sitting in seventh place with 30 points, they are within touching distance of the top five. They face a Sunderland side that has displayed remarkable resilience under Régis Le Bris.\n\nThe Black Cats occupy eighth place, level on 30 points with their hosts, after securing an “absorbing” 1-1 draw at Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. While Sunderland have held elite opposition like Manchester City and Spurs recently, they travel to West London searching for a clinical edge to turn these impressive stalemates into three points.\n\nDate: Wednesday, 7 January 2026\n\nVenue: Gtech Community Stadium, London\n\nLast Meeting: Sunderland 2–1 Brentford, 30 August 2025, Premier League\n\nKeith Andrews reports no fresh injury concerns following the high-scoring victory at Everton. However, the squad remains depleted by long-term ACL injuries to Fábio Carvalho and Antoni Milambo, while Josh Dasilva is still sidelined. The Bees are also missing Frank Onyeka and Dango Ouattara, who are currently representing their nations at AFCON. Midfielder Mathias Jensen is expected to return to the starting XI after a recent bout of illness.\n\nThe Black Cats face a significant personnel crisis due to AFCON commitments, with six first-team players unavailable: Reinildo Mandava, Noah Sadiki, Chemsdine Talbi, Arthur Masuaku, Bertrand Traoré, and Habib Diarra. Manager Régis Le Bris must also sweat on the fitness of forward Wilson Isidor, who will undergo a late test. Centre-back Daniel Ballard remains a doubt with a recurring ankle issue, while Aji Alese is a long-term absentee.\n\nBrentford have transformed the Gtech Community Stadium into a fortress under Keith Andrews. They have won six of their 10 home league games this season, a record matched only by Mark Warburton in the club’s modern history. Notably, striker Igor Thiago is in electric form, having netted 14 goals in 20 appearances. He is now just one goal shy of the Premier League record for most goals by a Brazilian in a single campaign.\n\nSunderland arrive as the division’s undisputed “stalemate specialists,” having drawn each of their last four matches against top-tier opposition. Should they draw again on Wednesday, they would be the first team to record five consecutive Premier League stalemates since 2021. Despite their injury woes, their defensive organisation remains elite; the Black Cats have conceded goals in both halves in only 5% of their matches this season.\n\nBrentford predicted XI: Kelleher; Kayode, Ajer, Collins, Henry; Yarmoliuk, Janelt; Jensen, Damsgaard, Schade; Thiago\n\nSunderland predicted XI: Roefs; Hume, Mukiele, Alderete, Cirkin; Geertruida, Xhaka; Mayenda, Le Fée, Adingra; Brobbey\n\nIn the UK, the match will be broadcast live on Sky Sports Tennis, with coverage starting at 18:00 GMT.\n\nRead more- Semenyo medical booked as Man City eye next transfer target\n\nSee Also- Enzo Maresca breaks silence on Chelsea exit with farewell message\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Fresh from a dramatic weekend in the Premier League title race, Aston Villa travel to Selhurst Park on Wednesday night knowing that a victory could propel them into second place.\n\nUnai Emery’s side recently dispatched Nottingham Forest 3-1 to keep pace with the leaders, but they face a historical “bogey” ground in South London. Crystal Palace find themselves in a mid-winter slump, having failed to win in their last seven matches, but the Eagles have traditionally dominated Villa at home, winning nine of their 13 Premier League encounters at Selhurst Park.\n\nWith Villa level on points with Manchester City following the Citizens’ recent 1-1 draw with Chelsea, the stakes for this road trip have never been higher for the high-flying Villans. Despite their lofty league position, Villa have conceded 14 goals in their last four games against Palace—as many as they had in the previous 15 meetings combined. Emery will be desperate to break his personal jinx against Oliver Glasner, having never beaten the Austrian in six previous meetings.\n\nDate: Wednesday, 7 January 2026\n\nLast Meeting: Aston Villa 0–3 Crystal Palace, 31 August 2025, Premier League\n\nOliver Glasner’s squad depth is being tested to the limit following a bruising encounter at Newcastle. Nathaniel Clyne (abductor) and Jefferson Lerma (concussion) are both ruled out, joining long-term absentees Daichi Kamada, Daniel Muñoz, and Cheick Doucouré on the sidelines. In a significant boost, Chris Richards is set to return to the matchday squad, though he is likely to start on the bench. The Eagles may hand a full debut to club-record signing Brennan Johnson, who joined from Tottenham last week.\n\nThe visitors are sweating on the fitness of defensive mainstays Tyrone Mings and Pau Torres, with both players facing late tests after lengthy injury layoffs. Midfielders Amadou Onana and Ross Barkley remain unavailable, while Evann Guessand is away at the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast. In their absence, the partnership of Youri Tielemans and Boubacar Kamara is expected to continue in the engine room.\n\nPalace boast incredible home dominance in this fixture, winning six of their last seven home games against Villa. This includes the last three in a row by a combined score of 10-1. Jean-Philippe Mateta remains the man to watch; he has been involved in nine goals against Villa—more than against any other Premier League side. However, the Eagles enter this clash without a win in their last seven outings across all competitions.\n\nVilla have been in sensational form, particularly Ollie Watkins, who has scored six goals since the start of December—more than any other player in the division. A win tonight would take Villa to 45+ points after 21 games for only the third time in their history. Notably, on both previous occasions they reached this milestone (1895-96 and 1898-99), they went on to win the league title.\n\nCrystal Palace predicted XI: Henderson; Canvot, Lacroix, Guéhi; Rodney, Wharton, Hughes, Mitchell; Johnson, Pino; Mateta\n\nAston Villa predicted XI: Martínez; Cash, Konsa, Lindelöf, Maatsen; Kamara, Tielemans; McGinn, Rogers, Buendía; Watkins\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on Sky Sports+. Coverage begins at 18:00 GMT, with the game kicking off at 19:30 GMT.\n\nRead more- Pep Guardiola reacts to Ruben Amorim sacking by Man Utd\n\nSee Also- Two surprise Man Utd candidates emerge as new manager search underway\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Brentford host Sunderland tonight while they aim to cement their place in the top seven and continue their improbable European charge.\n\nKeith Andrews’ side has moved level on 30 points with tonight’s opponents following a clinical 4-2 victory over Everton. The Bees have been formidable at home this season, losing only once in 10 matches at the Gtech. Consequently, confidence is high as they look to exploit a Sunderland side that, while resilient, is currently depleted by international absences.\n\nBrentford are boosted by the news that they sustained no fresh injuries during their high-scoring weekend win. However, Keith Andrews is still without several long-term absentees, including Josh Dasilva, Fábio Carvalho, and Antoni Milambo. Midfielders Frank Onyeka and Dango Ouattara also remain unavailable due to AFCON commitments.\n\nOn a positive note, Mathias Jensen is poised to return to the heart of the midfield after recovering from illness. He is expected to partner Vitaly Janelt and Yehor Yarmoliuk to provide the platform for the Bees’ lethal attack. All eyes will be on Igor Thiago, who is currently averaging a goal every 1.4 games and sits on the cusp of a Premier League goalscoring record for Brazilian players.\n\nBrentford predicted XI: Kelleher; Kayode, Ajer, Collins, Henry; Yarmoliuk, Janelt; Jensen, Damsgaard, Schade; Thiago\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at the Gtech Community Stadium on Wednesday, 7 January 2026.

    "description": "How will Sunderland line up at Brentford tonight?",
    "fullText": "After a couple of tough games – mentally and physically – we’re heading to Brentford without too many options to change things up. Will Regis keep faith with the team that played against Spurs, or will we look to freshen things up a little bit? Here’s how I think we’ll line up tonight.\n\nAnother good display by Roefs against Spurs, and he’ll be hoping to add yet another clean sheet to his season’s tally tonight.\n\nDan Ballard came off the bench against Spurs and added a lot to the defence – and I think we’ll see him return to the starting line up tonight, with Nordi moving over to right back. Omar Alderete will continue alongside Ballard, while I think Dennis Cirkin will get another run out after a hard fought hour at Spurs.\n\nI think we’ll see Trai Hume play as a right midfielder again today, dropping back to enable us to shift into a five in defence if need be. Ballard’s return will enable us to go with Geertruida in midfield too, with Enzo pushing up alongside Brian Brobbey and Simon Adingra – who’s been quietly impressive since getting back into the team – on the left.\n\nI thought Brobbey was excellent against Spurs – he didn’t have too many touches, but his off the ball work was impressive and signalled he’s really getting up to Premier League match fitness. Of course, his goal was fantastic too, and hopefully we’ll see him notch another tonight.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City return to the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday evening under significant pressure to reignite their title charge following a frustrating sequence of stalemates.\n\nPep Guardiola’s side saw their lead at the top vanish. Unfortunately, back-to-back draws against Sunderland and Chelsea proved costly. Now, they sit six points adrift of league leaders Arsenal. Historically, City boast an impeccable record against the Seagulls on home soil. However, a deepening defensive injury crisis threatens their title quest. Specifically, it could derail their hopes of closing the gap on the Gunners.\n\nConversely, Brighton arrive in Manchester with renewed optimism. Recently, they halted a bleak December run with a 2-0 victory over Burnley. Crucially, Fabian Hürzeler’s men already proved they can best the match favourites. Notably, they masterminded a 2-1 win at the Amex in August. Therefore, they aim to secure their first-ever league victory at the Etihad. Doing so would maintain their push for a top-half finish.\n\nDate: Wednesday, 7 January 2026\n\nVenue: Etihad Stadium, Manchester\n\nLast Meeting: Brighton 2–1 Manchester City, 31 August 2025, Premier League\n\nPep Guardiola is navigating a defensive emergency after Joško Gvardiol (ankle fracture) and Rúben Dias (hamstring) both sustained injuries against Chelsea. Gvardiol is expected to be out for an extended period, while Dias faces a recovery time of up to six weeks. They join John Stones on a crowded injury list, though Nathan Aké is fit to return, and Nico Gonzalez has been cleared to play. The hosts remain without Oscar Bobb, Mateo Kovačić, and Savinho, while Omar Marmoush and Rayan Aït-Nouri are away at the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nThe Seagulls will assess winger Yankuba Minteh (thigh) following his late withdrawal against West Ham, while Mats Wieffer remains out with a persistent toe injury. Fabian Hürzeler continues to be without Carlos Baleba (AFCON), Solly March (knee), Adam Webster (knee), and Stefanos Tzimas (knee). However, Kaoru Mitoma is fit to start after a successful return against Burnley, and veteran James Milner could feature to become just the fifth outfielder in Premier League history to play at age 40 or older.\n\nCity have established an incredible record of Wednesday dominance, winning 22 consecutive Premier League home games played on this specific day. The Etihad remains a fortress against this particular opponent, as City have never lost a home league game against Brighton in 15 attempts. However, Erling Haaland is currently enduring a rare goal search, having failed to score in his last three league starts. Guardiola will also be wary of another draw; one more stalemate would equal his personal record of three consecutive league draws.\n\nBrighton arrive with a perfect scoring record against City, having found the net in all 17 of their Premier League meetings. Nevertheless, their defensive fragility away from home is a concern, having conceded exactly two goals in each of their last three away Premier League matches. Hürzeler will be looking to replicate the tactical discipline shown in their August victory to exploit City’s depleted backline.\n\nManchester City predicted XI: Donnarumma; Lewis, Khusanov, Aké, O’Reilly; Rodri; Cherki, Foden, Reijnders, Doku; Haaland\n\nBrighton & Hove Albion predicted XI: Verbruggen; Veltman, Dunk, Van Hecke, Kadıoğlu; Gomez, Ayari; Gruda, Rutter, Mitoma; Kostoulas\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the match will be broadcast live on Sky Sports Main Event, Sky Ultra HD, SKY GO, and NOW TV. Coverage for this Wednesday night fixture begins ahead of the 19:30 GMT kick-off.\n\nRead more- Semenyo medical booked as Man City eye next transfer target\n\nSee Also- Pep Guardiola reacts to Ruben Amorim sacking by Man Utd\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "The post-Ruben Amorim era at Manchester United begins under the lights at Turf Moor this Wednesday, as interim head coach Darren Fletcher takes the reins following the Portuguese manager’s departure on Monday.\n\nDarren Fletcher is expected to restore a traditional tactical identity. Historically, the Scot was a staple of the Sir Alex Ferguson era. Now, his side remains firmly in the hunt for Champions League qualification. Specifically, Manchester United sit sixth. However, they remain level on points with fifth-placed Chelsea. In contrast, their hosts face much more dire straits.\n\nUnfortunately, Scott Parker’s Burnley suffer from an 11-match winless run. Consequently, they find themselves six points adrift of safety. Therefore, this midweek clash represents a vital “must-win” for both teams. Worryingly, the Clarets picked up only two points from a possible 33. Now, they desperately need a spark to avoid relegation. For United, this fixture offers a massive opportunity. Hopefully, they can turn recent stalemates into victories. Finally, Fletcher can make a statement of intent for the new year.\n\nDate: Wednesday, 7 January 2026\n\nLast Meeting: Manchester United 3–0 Burnley, 30 August 2025\n\nThe Clarets are navigating a severe availability crisis at a critical juncture of the season. Josh Cullen, Zeki Amdouni, Connor Roberts, and Jordan Beyer are all confirmed absentees due to injury. The squad is further thinned by the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), with Axel Tuanzebe, Hannibal Mejbri, and Lyle Foster still away in Morocco. However, there is hope that influential defender Maxime Estève could return to the backline after missing the recent defeat to Brighton.\n\nDarren Fletcher is set to transition back to a 4-2-3-1 formation and could be handed a massive boost with the return of club captain Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount, both of whom are nearing fitness. On the downside, the defensive unit remains depleted; Matthijs de Ligt (back), Harry Maguire (thigh), and Kobbie Mainoo (calf) are expected to miss out. Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo, and Noussair Mazraoui also remain unavailable due to AFCON commitments.\n\nBurnley have now lost nine of their last 11 Premier League games, a run that has seen them plummet to 19th in the standings. At home, their struggles are equally pronounced; they are winless in their last eight games against United at Turf Moor, scoring just a single goal in that period. Notably, manager Scott Parker has lost 65% of his home Premier League matches, the highest percentage for any manager with at least 25 home games in the competition’s history.\n\nManchester United have drawn their last three Premier League fixtures and are looking to secure their first three points of 2026. While their overall form is stable—with only one loss in their last eight matches—their away defensive record is a major concern. United have not kept a clean sheet in any of their last 15 Premier League away games, their longest such drought since 1978. However, the Red Devils remain lethal against promoted sides, boasting an unbeaten record of 26 matches against such opposition.\n\nBurnley predicted XI: Dúbravka; Walker, Ekdal, Estève, Pires; Ugochukwu, Florentino, Laurent; Edwards, Broja, Anthony\n\nManchester United predicted XI: Lammens; Dalot, Heaven, Martinez, Shaw; Casemiro, Ugarte; Dorgu, Fernandes, Cunha; Sesko\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Premier League. Coverage is scheduled to start at 19:30 GMT ahead of the 20:15 kick-off.\n\nRead more- Pep Guardiola reacts to Ruben Amorim sacking by Man Utd\n\nSee Also- Two surprise Man Utd candidates emerge as new manager search underway\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Manchester United travel to Turf Moor tonight while they begin a new chapter under interim head coach Darren Fletcher.\n\nDarren Fletcher takes charge following Ruben Amorim’s departure. Notably, the interim manager abandons the previous tactical setup for a traditional 4-2-3-1 system. Desperately, Fletcher aims to secure a first victory of 2026. Crucially, he must capitalise on Burnley’s poor run of form to aid United’s Champions League push.\n\nFortunately, Darren Fletcher receives an immediate boost. Specifically, club captain Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount return to the fold. In fact, Fernandes could slot straight back into the starting XI to provide a creative spark. However, United remain without Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo, and Noussair Mazraoui due to AFCON commitments.\n\nUnfortunately, injuries deplete the defensive unit. Specifically, Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire, and Kobbie Mainoo remain sidelined. Consequently, Ayden Heaven looks set to partner Lisandro Martinez in central defence. In attack, Matheus Cunha will likely support Benjamin Sesko. Finally, Fletcher wants his players to “express themselves” in this freer system.\n\nManchester United predicted XI: Lammens; Dalot, Heaven, Martinez, Shaw; Casemiro, Ugarte; Dorgu, Fernandes, Cunha; Sesko\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at Turf Moor on Wednesday, 7 January 2026.

    "description": "“Now that he finds himself amid the bright lights of the Premier League, why shouldn’t he continue along the same path?”",
    "fullText": "Want an illustration of how quickly time seems to pass by in football terms — or simply graphic proof of how radically things have evolved at Sunderland in recent years?\n\nThe picture below was taken just under three years ago, during a game in which a ridiculously youthful Chris Rigg was denied what would’ve been a fairytale FA Cup goal against Fulham at Craven Cottage and everyone started to sit up and take notice of the latest exciting talent to roll off the Academy of Light’s production line.\n\nDuring the intervening three years, a hell of a lot has changed at the Stadium of Light.\n\nTony Mowbray was temporarily replaced by Mike Dodds, Michael Beale was hired and succeeded as head coach by Mike Dodds and then Régis Le Bris, and the entire process — often difficult and frustrating — eventually led to the promised land of Premier League promotion, with Rigg earning the right to call himself a top flight footballer after a red and white rise that’s encompassed memorable goals, eye-catching performances and plenty of excitement about what he could eventually achieve.\n\nOf course, the dynamic is very different now and if the Sunderland side in which Rigg made his first team debut was talented if somewhat unbalanced and lacking depth in key areas, the team in which he’s currently fighting to establish himself in is of a far higher standard.\n\nUnder Le Bris, Sunderland are competitive in the Premier League and after a heavyweight summer recruitment drive, Rigg is now surrounded by elite talents in more or less every position. As such, the former prodigy is entering the next stage of his development — one during which we all hope his rate of progress will continue.\n\nI firmly believe that at this stage and for the good of his future prospects, Rigg is exactly where he needs to be.\n\nIt’s true that he’s often been played outside of his “natural” position and although he always gives his all when deployed on the wing, it’s obvious that his skillset is best suited to the number ten position, albeit with Enzo Le Fée arguably our leading light in that particular role. That’s not necessarily problematic in itself — this league demands far greater quality and depth, after all — and for Rigg, perhaps it’ll simply be a matter of patience, discipline and seeing the bigger picture.\n\nGiven that he comes across as a single-minded, grounded and extremely driven young footballer, one would hope that the presence of such talent within the Sunderland camp is inspiring Rigg, driving him on and ensuring he keeps his eyes on the goal of constant improvement.\n\nIn my view, one thing is absolutely certain: Rigg should not be loaned out this month and if we arrive at the end of the transfer window having bade a temporary farewell to this immensely talented prospect, it would be detrimental to his own personal development and would also deprive Sunderland of a valuable option; someone who could play an important role during the final months of the season.\n\nDespite the impressive way in which we overhauled the squad during the summer, the long-standing argument of “He’s not ready for the Premier League” is ringing increasingly hollow, as is the notion that we should send a gifted player to the Championship on the basis they need to “toughen up”. In fact, it’s not too dissimilar to the stuff we used to hear as starry-eyed kids back in the Russell Foster days: “This player or that player won’t make it because they’re too small”, and so on.\n\nSuch has been the explosion of talented teenagers in recent years that if you haven’t established yourself by the age of twenty or so, you’re viewed as being behind the curve, but that’s a red herring.\n\nIt’s a universal truth that different players develop at different rates, and the idea of such a quality footballer being farmed out and forced to mix it with the likes of Millwall and Stoke City on the basis that his development will be expedited as a result is fairly gruesome.\n\nRigg is currently training and playing within an elite, high-performance environment, with a coach and captain setting and driving high standards having implemented a style of football that demands a great deal from the squad.\n\nTo my mind, that’s the perfect place for him and I trust Le Bris and his coaching staff to continue to do the right thing — and for Rigg himself to continue to apply himself properly and make the most of any and all opportunities that he’s given.\n\nAs was the case back in 2023, the sky is the limit for Rigg and now that he finds himself amid the bright lights of the Premier League, why shouldn’t he continue along the same path? It’s all within his hands and I’m hopeful that he’ll do exactly that.",

    "title": "On This Day (7 January 1862) Sunderland’s First Captain, John Auld, Is Born",
    "description": "Captain of our first league team and a player of considerable skill and influence, Johnny Auld was a leader on and off the field and something of a football pioneer.",
    "fullText": "John Robertson Auld was born in Scotland in 1862. His early football career appears to have been fashioned playing centre-half for Lugar Boswell, a club based in the small Ayrshire town of Lugar where he had moved to with his elder brother to open a Cordwainer’s (shoe-mender’s) business.\n\nHis determined and attacking performances brought him to the attention of famed Scottish side Third Lanark in 1883 and he seems to have played there for most of the period between 1883 to 1887, although there is record of him turning out for Queens Park during this period too. Both these clubs were within walking distance of his parents’ home in Glasgow, and it seems he spent weekends there, returning to his work in Lugar during the week.\n\nIn 1887/88 he signed for Queens Park, where his play was described as “a little rough”. He returned to play for Third Lanark in 1888/89 and it was in this season that the “Thirds” or the “Hi Hi” as they came to be known, won the Scottish Cup.\n\nThe winning of the trophy, as well as his three Scottish caps (two in 1887 and the other in 1889) all added to a burgeoning reputation for Auld in the game. He was an imposing centre-half who was adept at playing the more attacking Scottish version of his position and it was no surprise that clubs South of the border were showing interest.\n\nIn 1889 Tom Watson and Sunderland came North looking for talent. Top of their list was a captain and centre-half and Johnny Auld fitted the brief.\n\nSunderland were on the cusp of their first season in the Football League – indeed, they were the first team to join the league after its formation in 1888/89. Stoke had finished bottom and had failed to get re-elected. Sunderland had mounted a vigorous campaign to be elected, including a promise to pay the travel costs of all visiting teams, a not inconsiderable burden given every other team in the league was from the North West or Midlands.\n\nJohnny Auld was one of the first of a raft of heralded players recruited from Scotland by Sunderland in these early years of the league. Fine players such as Johnny Campbell and David Hannah from Renton, Hugh ‘Lalty’ Wilson from Newmilns and Jimmy Millar from Annbank were part of that first tranche of Scots to join Sunderland as “the team of all talents” began its formation.\n\nAged twenty-eight, Auld made the move South to join Tom Watson’s project. His transfer included an agreement by the club to facilitate the establishment of a Cordwainer’s business in the town. Auld also received a signing-on fee of £20 and £150 for agreeing to turn professional. He also negotiated a whopping £300 in salary over two years. He was, without doubt, a major investment on the part of the club at this time, and his influence in attracting the best of talent North of the Border was probably part of the package he brought with him.\n\nSunderland finished a credible seventh in their first season and played their way to the semi-final of the FA Cup, with the capture of Ned Doig for £150 from Arbroath a key acquisition as the spine of ‘the team of all talents’ took life with Doig, Auld and Campbell/Millar.\n\nThe following season 1891/92 with the inspirational Auld as pivot and captain and the arrival of James “Blood” Hannah and Donald Gow from Glasgow Rangers, Sunderland won the league championship at only the second time of asking. It was a huge achievement and backed up by a colourful march to the FA Cup semi-finals again.\n\nAuld’s influence and personality was a major factor in uniting and guiding these stars of the game into a team to be reckoned with.\n\nThe title was retained in 1892/93 and a runners-up spot in 1893/94, with the half-back line of Wilson, Auld and Gibson, with William Dunlop augmenting and eventually becoming a permanent member of this formidable line from 1892.\n\nIn 1894/95 the title was won again but by this point Johnny Auld was into his thirties and played only four games in the league campaign as he covered illness and injury in the half-back line. One game Johnny Auld did play in saw him captain the side and become the ‘World Champions’. Hearts, league champions in Scotland took on the English champions Sunderland on the 27th April 1895. Both teams were fully composed of Scottish players and a cracker of a game saw Sunderland and Johnny Auld lift the trophy, as they eventually triumphed by five goals to three, with Auld scoring one of the goals.\n\nIn 1896 Johnny Auld made the short but historic journey to Newcastle, becoming the first ever player to make that switch in the football league era. He only played a season before establishing a role that in its description resembles the modern day Sporting Director.\n\nHe became part of a three-man committee identifying players. His fame and influence were such that, similar to his time at Sunderland, a raft of good Scottish talent was signed. He was also instrumental in recruiting the innovative Scottish trainer John Quar McPherson. Consequently, by 1912, our closest rivals had three league titles and four FA Cup final defeats on their CV, eventually winning the cup in 1910.\n\nThroughout his time at Newcastle Johnny Auld continued to reside in Sunderland and oversee his Cordwainers business in the town. And, despite his role north of the Tyne, Auld still remained a key person in the story of Sunderland AFC. He acted as a financial guarantor for the club as Sunderland fell on hard times during the First World War, and also paid for the funeral of his former teammate Johnny Campbell in 1906.\n\nAuld was residing at 46 Roker Park Road in the town when he passed away after a fall from a tram at the age of seventy in 1932. He is buried in Mere Knolls cemetery in Sunderland.\n\nJohnny Auld was without doubt one of football’s first pioneers as a player. A captain and leader, his influence and skill, not only in defence but in the initiating of attacks at which he so excelled saw unprecedented success for the ‘team of all talents’ and rightly affords him a place in the history of Sunderland AFC.",

    "fullText": "Everton host Wolves tonight while they aim to recover from back-to-back home defeats.\n\nDavid Moyes’ side has moved into the bottom half of the table following a chaotic 4-2 loss to Brentford at the weekend. Despite a resilient away win at Nottingham Forest recently, the Toffees have struggled to maintain defensive solidity on their own patch. Moyes will be looking for a response from his senior core to ensure they do not slip further towards the relegation battle.\n\nDavid Moyes manages a significantly thinned squad due to international duty and a growing injury list. Iliman Ndiaye and Idrissa Gana Gueye are both unavailable as they represent Senegal at AFCON. Additionally, defensive mainstays Jarrad Branthwaite and Seamus Coleman remain out with hamstring injuries. Midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall is also a confirmed absentee with a similar issue.\n\nOn a positive note, Michael Keane is fit to continue in the heart of the defence alongside James Tarkowski. Merlin Röhl is pushing for a recall to the starting lineup after dropping to the bench in the previous match. Jack Grealish, who has already provided six assists in his debut campaign for the club, will be the primary creative outlet. He is expected to support a frontline featuring Thierno Barry and potentially Tyler Dibling.\n\nEverton predicted XI: Pickford; O’Brien, Tarkowski, Keane, Mykolenko; Iroegbunam, Garner; McNeil, Röhl, Grealish; Barry\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at the Hill Dickinson Stadium on Wednesday, 7 January 2026. Kick-off is scheduled for 19:30 GMT.\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on Sky Sports F1 and Sky Sports+.

    "fullText": "Wolves travel to Liverpool tonight while they seek to build on their first victory of the Premier League season.\n\nRob Edwards finally secured three points with a dominant 3-0 win over West Ham at the weekend, snapping a 19-game winless run. While they remain at the bottom of the table, the victory has injected vital confidence into the squad. Edwards must now address his side’s poor away record, as the Old Gold have yet to win on the road this term.\n\nRob Edwards manages several significant absentees but is boosted by some positive fitness updates. Hwang Hee-chan and João Gomes are both expected to be fit after overcoming knocks sustained in the win over West Ham. However, captain Toti remains sidelined, and Emmanuel Agbadou is away on AFCON duty with Ivory Coast. Rodrigo Gomes and Marshall Munetsi are also nearing returns but are unlikely to start tonight.\n\nThe visitors are expected to name a largely unchanged side following their impressive performance at Molineux. Jhon Arias, who scored his first goal for the club last time out, will likely continue in midfield alongside André and Mateus Mane. Notably, Hwang Hee-chan reached 30 Premier League goal involvements for the club at the weekend and will be the focal point of the attack alongside Jorgen Strand Larsen. Edwards will be relying on this pair to end Wolves’ open-play goal drought away from home.\n\nWolves predicted XI: Sá; S. Bueno, Mosquera, Krejčí; Tchatchoua, Arias, André, Mané, H. Bueno; Arokodare, Larsen\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at the Hill Dickinson Stadium on Wednesday, 7 January 2026.

    "fullText": "Bournemouth host Tottenham Hotspur tonight while they aim to snap a historic 11-match winless streak.\n\nAndoni Iraola’s side has moved to 15th in the table following a spirited but ultimately unsuccessful 3-2 defeat to Arsenal. Despite the poor run, the Cherries have the motivation of securing a first-ever league double over Spurs. However, the manager must navigate a significant injury crisis that has worsened following the weekend’s action.\n\nThe headline for the hosts is the loss of Justin Kluivert, who requires surgery on a left knee injury. His absence adds to a depleted midfield and attack, with Ryan Christie and Tyler Adams still out. In defence, Ben Gannon-Doak remains sidelined, though Veljko Milosavljević provides a glimmer of hope, having returned to light training.\n\nThe focal point of the attack will once again be Antoine Semenyo. Although a £65m transfer to Manchester City has been agreed, the winger is expected to start in what is likely to be an emotional farewell appearance at the Vitality Stadium. He will be supported by Evanilson and David Brooks as the Cherries look to exploit a Spurs defence that has looked vulnerable in recent weeks.\n\nBournemouth predicted XI: Petrovic; Jimenez, Hill, Senesi, Truffert; Tavernier, Scott; Semenyo, Cook, Brooks; Evanilson\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at the Vitality Stadium on Wednesday, 7 January 2026.

Their away form isn’t nearly as good, which is another sign of how impressive this record is since they sit on thirty points as they occupy seventh in the table – only ahead of us on goal difference.\n\nEveryone thought the bubble had burst when Thomas Frank left to take the Spurs job, but Andrews has defied all of the predictions, although the pressure is firmly on holding their form at hom,e as only the bottom four have lost more than Brentford.\n\nIn all competitions, we’ve only taken on tonight’s opposition on twenty occasions. In the forty years between meetings in the league that ranged from 1947 and 1987, we took them on twice, once in the FA Cup and once in the League Cup and this is only our fourth trip to Griffin Park for a league game in the last forty years – the first in the top flight since 1946.\n\nIn the last four games, Le Bris’ side has shown how hard we are to beat; tonight we may need a similar performance.\n\nThe bookies have the Lads at 16/5 to win the game, while Brentford are priced at 4/5, and the draw is 5/2.\n\n[Yennaris 8’, Jozefzoon 47’, Maupay 78’ – Grabban 13’, Bentley (OG) 40’, Grabban (pen) 45’]\n\nSunderland: Steele, Jones, Kone, O’Shea, Oviedo, Watmore (McManaman), Cattermole, Ndong, McGeady (Vaughan), Honeyman, Grabban (Vaughan) Substitutes not used: Ruiter, Matthews, Gibson, Rodwell\n\nBrentford: Bentley, Dalsgaard, Clarke, Dennaris, Egan, Bjelland, Jozefzoon, Woods, Vibe (Maupay), Sawyers (McEachran), Watkins (Canos) Substitutes not used: Daniels, Barbet, Mepham, Mokotjo\n\nThey’re strong at home, and I think it will come down to the only goal of the game.",

    "description": "Skyridge came back to beat Layton 67-56, with double-digit points from four different seniors.",
    "fullText": "The two halves of Tuesday’s game between Layton and Skyridge couldn’t have been more different, and they showed off two completely different styles of play.\n\nLayton’s slow, defensive style dictated the first half, and the Lancers built up a lead. However, Skyridge’s fast-paced offense ruled supreme after halftime, and the Falcons ran away with the game 67-56.\n\nThe Lancers imposed their will first. It started on the defensive side of the ball as Layton built a quick 9-2 lead.\n\nLayton held Skyridge to only 22 points in the first half and minimized the Falcons’ strong suit, which is transition points. Rebounds and limiting turnovers also played into Layton’s hand and earned it a 29-22 halftime lead.\n\nSkyridge’s Ryder Gentry kept the offense afloat by scoring 10 of the Falcons’ 12 second-quarter points.\n\n“A lot of (the struggle) was because of Layton,” said Skyridge head coach Jeff Gardner. “Coach (Kelby) Miller runs one of the top programs in the state, and they came out and played really well and had us on our heels. They were really hard to score on. They blocked shots, and I felt like Layton really played well, but we made sure to just stay in the game, hanging around.”\n\nThe final 16 minutes couldn’t have looked much different from the first 16, and it all started in transition. Skyridge completely flipped the game’s pace by pushing the ball quickly after rebounds.\n\nSkyridge then took that opportunity to work the ball around and get open shots on the perimeter that it didn’t get in the first half. The Falcons’ Carson Mosteller hit two 3-pointers in the third quarter, with Zach Gagon and Gentry each adding another.\n\nThe quick pace and open shots led to a 20-4 run in the third quarter. In total, Skyridge outscored Layton 25-7.\n\n“We wanted to keep the pace, and we wanted to keep attacking the rim,” Gardner said. “We didn’t do a great job in the first half finishing at the rim, but we felt like if we kept attacking the rim, it would open up our threes.”\n\nLayton was down, but it certainly wasn’t out. The Lancers’ Karter Miller hit two 3-pointers, including a four-point play, to try to stay in it.\n\nThat fight back wasn’t in the cards for Layton as Skyridge kept making strong basketball plays. Gentry ended with a team-high 19 points, but he also contributed game-winning plays like offensive rebounds and smart extra passes on offense.\n\n“I love that we can come back from a rough first half and play an amazing second half, turn it around, win by 10 when we were down by 10,” Gentry said. “I feel like that just shows that we have really good fight in us and we’re a great team.”\n\nThe senior core of Gentry, Gagon, Mosteller and Joel Gardner each contributed double-digit points in the comeback win, which was the fourth consecutive for the Falcons.\n\n“Our team likes to play fast, and we’ve got this group of seniors who have been together since second grade, and they love to play with each other, and they believe in each other,” Gardner said. “I think just offensively, our whole message is attack the basket and then kick out when you can’t get to the rim. They did that masterfully.”",

(AP) — Alex Wennberg had a goal and an assist against his former team, and the San Jose Sharks bounced back from a frustrating loss three days earlier and beat the Columbus Blue Jackets 5-2 on Tuesday night.\n\nZack Ostapchuk also had a goal while Macklin Celebrini and Mario Ferraro added empty-netters to help the Sharks win their fourth in five games. Alex Nedeljkovic stopped 34 shots for San Jose, which was coming off a 7-3 loss to Tampa Bay on Saturday night.\n\nWennberg, the Blue Jackets’ first-round pick in 2013, assisted on Pavol Regenda’s goal in the first period then scored on a power play early in the second for his eighth goal of the season. That moved the 31-year-old within two points of reaching 400 for his career.\n\nCelebrini’s goal was his 23rd of the season and extended the 19-year-old’s career-high point streak to 11 games.\n\nZach Werenski scored his team-leading 16th goal for Columbus, and Sean Monahan also had a goal. Jet Greaves finished with 31 saves.\n\nSan Jose broke through moments after Nedeljkovic stopped Charlie Coyle’s wrist shot. Regenda responded quickly and broke free to score his sixth of the season on a cross-ice pass from Wennberg with 49 seconds left.\n\nWennberg made it 2-0 with a power-play goal at 4:14 of the second when he fired the puck between Greaves' legs. It gave Wennberg his seventh multi-point game of the season.\n\nWerenski trimmed San Jose’s lead to 2-1 with his goal late in the second. He has five points in three games since returning from an ankle injury.\n\nOstapchuk’s second goal of the season made it 3-1 before Monahan pulled the Blue Jackets within one with 3:55 to go.\n\nFerraro and Celebrini scored into the empty net 45 seconds apart to seal San Jose's win.\n\nBlue Jackets: At Vegas on Thursday night.\n\nSharks: At Los Angeles on Wednesday night.\n\nAP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES -- Coming off the heels of a 34-point loss to crosstown rival UCLA, the USC Women of Troy looked to etch a positive note in their first game back at the Galen Center in 2026 against the Oregon Ducks Tuesday night, but had, arguably, suffered an even greater loss. A contest that was surely in their hands from the jump, slipped away in a matter of minutes as the Ducks rallied back down by 16 points at the half and conjured up a 14-0 run to end the game, coming away with the 71-66 comeback win.\n\nFollowing the stunning turn of events for USC, Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb gave credit where it was due to Oregon.\n\n“Credit to Oregon. They were poised. I’m not surprised they hung in there when they were down… about as upsetting a loss as we’ve had in this building. We have a lot of potential to be really good, but not if we don’t figure some things out,\" coach Gottlieb said.\n\nBefore tip-off, USC had announced that defensive guru Kennedy Smith would be out Tuesday with a lower leg injury and listed as day-to-day. The absence of Smith was not felt until later down the stretch for the Women of Troy.\n\nUSC got off to a slow start offensively to begin the contest, mirroring their style of play at the Pauley Pavilion last Saturday, unable to score within the first four minutes of the game. The tides soothed for the Trojans as they would conclude the first quarter on an impressive 16-0 run, led by Kara Dunn's team-high 12 first-quarter points, and take a 23-9 lead to the second quarter.\n\nThe offensive production continued for the Women of Troy heading into the half, as Jazzy Davidson began her impressive performance on the floor, and by the end of regulation, notched the third double-double of her collegiate career with a final stat line of 14 points, 13 rebounds, 5 assists, 2 blocks, and two steals. Kara Dunn would lead the team with 21 points, but was more focused on the team's headspace and how they could improve on it moving forward, especially after back-to-back demoralizing losses.\n\n\"I think it's time that we make a change,\" Dunn said. \"Coming off a loss like that, we need to be as hungry as we can be, and going into the next game, we have to have a change of heart.\"\n\nCoach Gottlieb then voiced her view on the current status of her team's headspace and gave a clear reality check on what she saw shift from her team's first-half performance play, compared to the second half, which echoed through the media room in a frenzy.\n\n\"I thought we came out in the second half like we have arrived,\" coach Gottlieb said. \"That's why I called such a quick timeout in the third quarter because I did not like our demeanor. I did not like how it felt. I felt we weren't pressuring them as much.\"\n\nThe headspace has to change for the Women of Troy as they gave up 50 second-half points to the Ducks, including the 14-0 run that Oregon would eventually go on in the final four minutes of the fourth quarter that inevitably decided the Trojans' fate.\n\nWith back-to-back losses like this, it would be hard to find the big red reset button needed as the new year gets going, but the Women of Troy have a few days to clear their head of their worst losses of the season before traveling to Minnesota on Sunday.",

    "description": "New Berlin's offense went cold in the middle quarters, but Gabe Molloy helps Pretzels conquer Pawnee in coach Blake Lucas' return.",
    "fullText": "NEW BERLIN — Before the game, New Berlin junior Reid Hepperly, the last player introduced at the Pretzel Arena, went over and gave Pawnee coach Blake Lucas a handshake, then gave him a meaningful, sincere tap on the chest.\n\nIn the first quarter, Hepperly put on a display for his former coach by using his big body to worm his way in the paint and give the Pretzels (11-4 overall) eight points in the opening quarter. He finished the game with 16 points and 10 rebounds to help New Berlin and first-year coach Neil Holderread beat Pawnee 42-39 in a nonconference game and spoil Lucas’ return to the school where he coached for nine seasons and had a 165-102 record, plus two regional titles.\n\n“As a coach, he was good,” Hepperly said of Lucas. “He pushed us real hard. Playing against him just gives us extra motivation. Losing a coach, I mean, it sucks, but playing hard to beat him, it just felt good.”\n\nHepperly said he was hyped for the game all day.\n\n“I was ready to go. All day at school, I was just waiting,” Hepperly said. “And then I came out here and did my best.”\n\nMore: Bailey Leach, Plains girls basketball sink SHS comeback | Top performers\n\nDespite Lucas’ prompt return to the school, it was his first time coaching in the Pretzel Arena, which opened this school year to replace the Pretzel Dome as the Pretzels’ home gym. Lucas mostly dodged answering questions about his return.\n\n“You coach a group for several years and now you coach somewhere else,” he said. “God protects us. I'm thankful to be in Pawnee.”\n\nAbout the new gym, he said, “It's a nice gym.”\n\nGabe Molloy, one of two New Berlin seniors, had back-to-back layups to start the fourth quarter and pull the Pretzels into a 33-33 tie with 6 minutes, 58 seconds left. After a nearly two-minute lull in the scoring, Hepperly’s layup with 4:39 left gave New Berlin the lead for good.\n\n“Gabe's a really good player,” Holderread said. “He sets the tone defensively, he gets everything organized offensively. Things that don't show up in the stat sheet all the time.\n\n“He's not scoring a ton of points, (but) he's knocking down free throws when he needs to, he's getting us easy bucket after easy bucket. Gabe is a luxury to have, for sure.”\n\nIt was certainly a turnaround from how cold the Pretzels were in the second and third quarters. New Berlin began the game with a 14-9 lead after the first quarter but struggled to score in the middle periods: 3-for-16 in the second and 2-for-8 in the third. That allowed Pawnee (5-9) to establish its game and take a 28-21 lead before Carson Dodd connected on a 3-pointer with 3:21 left in the third. Ty Lederbrand, who was in foul trouble for most of the first half, scored in the paint and connected on a corner 3 for five quick points in the middle of that Pawnee run.\n\nNew Berlin didn’t want to lose twice to Pawnee in less than two weeks. Pawnee beat the Pretzels 47-35 in the first round of the Waverly Holiday Tournament on Dec. 26.\n\n“Last week we attacked their pressure and tonight, we just played a little hesitant,” Lucas said. “Because of that, we're on the other side of the win-loss column.”\n\nSophomore Gavin Greer led Pawnee with 15 points while Ryder Smith finished with 10. Pawnee shot 16-for-37 overall, including two of seven in the fourth. Pawnee was also outrebounded on the offensive glass 12-4 (New Berlin had a 30-26 rebounding edge overall).\n\n“We told our kids you can't expect just to come in and play the same way and expect the same result,” Lucas said. “You've got to bring it. Tonight was different: a little bit lesser stage here in the regular season where Waverly is about as good as it gets besides the postseason. We told our kids you had to come and even play better than you did. We just missed some free throws (2-for-8) and didn't rebound well enough to win tonight.”\n\nWith 3:13 remaining, Max Pointer hit a transition layup for a 37-33 lead and Hepperly followed that with a layup 49 seconds later.\n\n“He's a big body,” Holderread said of Hepperly. “He can do a lot of things for us. He's good on the boards, he's good in the post, he can shoot the 3.\n\n“He's a tough matchup for any team that we play. When he's able to do that early in the game, it kind of sets the tone for the rest of us, and we take advantage of that.”\n\nMore: North Mac boys basketball soaks up elusive Waverly Holiday title\n\nLederbrand then snapped the Pawnee scoring drought that lasted 7:02, from a Randy Schutt 3 with 1:16 left in the third until the layup by Lederbrand with 2:14 left in regulation. Jace Jankousky and Smith then split a pair of free throws to pull Pawnee within 39-37 with 1:10 left. Molloy had the final New Berlin field goal for a 41-37 lead and Greer hit a turnaround fadeaway shot with 26 seconds left. Pawnee’s hopes were ended on a turnover that became a jump ball to New Berlin with 2.4 remaining.\n\n“We're a veteran group,” Dodd said. “We have a lot of seniors and juniors, too, that stepped up this year. We practice hard, we know what we're doing in that situation; we were prepared.”\n\nHolderread reiterated Dodd’s sentiment.\n\n“We are veterans, but we're continuing to learn,” Holderread said. “That's our goal. We want to get better every single day. That's what we're trying to do.\n\n“I actually mentioned that at the end of the game here. We've kind of reversed roles. At the beginning of the season, it was me talking about how we're a veteran team, and we need to be able to close games when we lost a couple in the fourth quarter.\n\n“Now it's the opposite. We're doing those things where we have a lull in the middle of the game, and we're smart enough and veteran enough to make the right plays at the right time.\"\n\nContact Ryan Mahan: 788-1546, ryan.mahan@sj-r.com, Twitter.com/RyanMahanSJR.\n\nThis article originally appeared on State Journal-Register: IHSA boys basketball: New Berlin takes Round 2 meeting with Pawnee",

    "description": "EL SEGUNDO, Calif.",
    "fullText": "EL SEGUNDO, Calif. — The rise of another young star on the South Bay Lakers is grooming right in front of our eyes once again.\n\nMeanwhile, down in Southbay…\n\nKobe Bufkin w/ another:\n\n27 pts | 8 reb | 8 ast | 4 stls | 2 blks pic.twitter.com/Po1vn6zXEr\n\n— Lakers Legacy (@LakersLegacyPod) January 7, 2026\n\nIf history has taught us anything, it’s that South Bay is more than just a G League stop—it’s a proving ground. Alex Caruso carved his path here. Austin Reaves refined his game here. Scottie Pippen Jr. rebuilt momentum here. Time and time again, the South Bay Lakers have developed players who either make it back to the NBA or force an NBA team’s hand.\n\nKobe Bufkin looks like the next name on that list.\n\nBufkin poured in 27 points to lead South Bay to a 113–101 win over the Memphis Hustle, putting together another all-around performance that continues to turn heads around the league. At just 22 years old, Bufkin is playing with the confidence, poise, and edge of someone who knows this opportunity won’t last forever.\n\nDrafted 15th overall by the Atlanta Hawks in 2023 out of Michigan, Bufkin entered the league with high expectations. But as is often the case with young guards, things didn’t pan out the way either side envisioned early on. A new chapter opened on November 13, 2025, when Bufkin was traded from the Motor City Cruise, Detroit’s G League affiliate, and landed in South Bay.\n\nThere’s a certain poetry to it.\n\nBufkin was named after the late, great Kobe Bryant, and now finds himself wearing purple and gold in the organization most synonymous with the Mamba legacy.\n\n“Kobe is my favorite player,” Bufkin said. “Just seeing his name on the wall, his pictures of him, it’s cool.”\n\nThat connection isn’t just symbolic. Bufkin often laces up Kobe Bryant signature shoes, occasionally switching to Jayson Tatum’s JT line, but the influence is clear in the way he plays—fearless, aggressive, and relentlessly competitive.\n\nJack Haslett -- The Sporting Tribune\n\nSouth Bay Lakers guard Kobe Bufkin (6) waits for his teammates to help him up during a G-League basketball game between the South Bay Lakers and Memphis Hustle Tuesday, January 6, 2026 at UCLA Health Training Center in El Segendo, Calif.\n\nSince arriving in South Bay, Bufkin has been lighting up the scoreboard, averaging 28.3 points, 5.0 assists, and 4.3 rebounds through his first four regular-season games. Against Memphis, he set the tone early.\n\nBufkin scored 10 points in the first quarter, igniting a Lakers offense that jumped out to a double-digit lead and stretched it to as many as 15 points in the first half. Every time the Hustle tried to close the gap, Bufkin answered.\n\nThe defining sequence came late in the third quarter. Bufkin took an offensive foul on a moving screen, popped right back up, demanded the ball, attacked the lane, floated in a tough finish, absorbed contact, and calmly knocked down the free throw to complete the three-point play for his 20th point of the night. It was a sequence that embodied his mindset—toughness, urgency, and zero hesitation.\n\nBufkin finished with 27 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists in 39 minutes, stuffing the stat sheet while controlling the game’s biggest moments.\n\n“Taking advantage of that, getting my teammates involved,” Bufkin said. “When they weren’t down there protecting the rim, I’m taking it to the rim and making shots.”\n\nThe backcourt pairing of Bufkin and RJ Davis proved overwhelming for Memphis. Davis controlled the pace, organized the offense, and complemented Bufkin’s scoring punch, finishing with 17 points. Together, they kept the Hustle off balance all night.\n\nSouth Bay also received strong contributions across the board. Anton Watson scored 18 points, Tevian Jones added 14, and Kylor Kelley chipped in 13, as all five starters finished in double figures. Off the bench, Arthur Kaluma provided an immediate spark, scoring nine points in the first quarter alone and finishing with 16 points, knocking down all three of his attempts from beyond the arc.\n\nDespite committing 28 turnovers, the Lakers found ways to score, shooting an impressive 16-for-35 (45.7%) from three-point range and building a lead that grew to 16 points in the second half. Defensively, South Bay protected the paint, swatting away 14 shots in the win.\n\n“Something me and RJ gotta talk about,” Bufkin said of the turnovers. “Slowing down, getting to our reads—but yeah, that’s on us.”\n\nEven in victory, accountability remains part of Bufkin’s approach—another trait reminiscent of the name stitched across his chest.\n\nSouth Bay now heads to Austin, Texas for a two-game road trip before returning home to host the San Diego Clippers on January 14. If Bufkin continues on this trajectory, it won’t be long before NBA teams start circling once again.\n\n“There’s been a lot of things that I’ve seen around the league, learning to keep your head down and keep working,” Bufkin said on the noise surrounding his name around the league.\n\nAnother Kobe is rising in South Bay—and this one looks ready for his next shot.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea’s new head coach, Liam Rosenior is expected to be in attendance but will not leading the team just yet as the Blues make the short trip down the road to Craven Cottage, to take on friendly rivals Fulham. Instead of Rosenior, it will be interim head coach Calum McFarlane calling the shots, and hopefully just as effectively as he did over the weekend, when he engineered a very credible 1-1 draw away against Manchester City.\n\nAlas, the only team to truly benefit from that draw were Arsenal, who now have a six point lead at the top of the table, just past the halfway mark of the season.\n\nFor Chelsea, it’s now just one win in our last eight Premier League matches, collecting just eight points from the 24 on offer. Somehow we’re still in fifth, but we’re going to have to start picking up points if we want to remain in the Champions League places by season’s end.\n\nDate / Time: Wednesday, January 7, 19.30 GMT; 2:30pm EST; 1am IST (next day)\nVenue: Craven Cottage, SW6\nReferee: Peter Bankes (on pitch); John Brooks (VAR)\nForecast: Partly sunny and a slight breeze; no more snow sadly\n\nOn TV: Sky Sports Football (UK); none (USA); Star Sports Select HD2 (India); none (NGA); elsewhere\nStreaming: Sky Go (UK); Peacock (USA); JioHotstar (India); DStv Now, SuperSport GOtv (NGA)\n\nFulham team news: It’s been a decent festive period for midtable (as usual) Fulham, getting draws against Liverpool and Crystal Palace and wins against West Ham and Nottingham Forest. Their draw against Liverpool, last time out, saw both teams score in added-on time, with Fulham equalizing on a most unlikely Goal of the Season worldie from Harrison Reed: just his fourth goal in over 200 appearances for the club.\n\nHARRISON REED GOAL FROM ALL OF THE ANGLES WHAT A GOAL 😮‍💨👏🏻pic.twitter.com/DZGfsF6Srw\n\n— KinG £ (@xKGx__) January 4, 2026\n\nAnd they’ve done all that despite losing a trio of key players to Nigeria at the Africa Cup of Nations (Alex Iwobi, Calvin Bassey, and Samuel Chukwueze), and missing a few others through injury (Josh King, Kenny Tete, and Rodrigo Muniz). In better news for them, Ryan Sessegnon looks set to return from a hamstring problem.\n\nManager Marco Silva is weary of the mental and physical tolls these games have taken on his players, though such concerns can fall by the wayside when it comes to special derbies (even friendly ones), especially when one side may feel wronged by a certain decision (i.e. Josh King’s goal getting ruled in the reverse fixture at the Bridge earlier this season).\n\n“It’s special. It’s special, because we know what’s happened. […] It really hurt ourselves, our fans, this football club, the way we were not able to win the game at Stamford Bridge. The way the team performed almost perfectly first half, in a really tough game against a top, top side, the way the team performed, and everything that happened in that game, really hurt this football club. I’m not talking about one or two persons, or just the players – us, the football club, the way that things happened that Saturday morning.\n\n“It is what it is – now it’s another opportunity for us to enjoy, to embrace a big challenge with our fans to play a derby like a derby should be played. Simple as that. It’s a new game, a new story. I don’t want anyone to think about the past, we have to look for the future, and what’s going to be most important is the next one. It’s a special game.”\n\n-Marco Silva; \n\nChelsea team news: Robert Sánchez and Wesley Fofana were both late scratches over the weekend, with injury and illness, respectively, but they are both back in training and in contention to start. Same goes for Marc Cucurella, who’s barely ever injured, but has missed the last couple games with a hamstring concern. We also welcome back Moisés Caicedo from his latest suspension.\n\nLevi Colwill, Dário Essugo, and Roméo Lavia remain out. The club recently wished Mykhailo Mudryk a happy birthday on social media, so we should probably mention the suspended winger here as well. How’s the appeals process going, Misha?\n\nMcFarlane will be hoping to hand over the reigns to Rosenior with the team back on the right path.\n\n“[This is a] really talented group, young, hungry, have shown they can play at the top top level against top top sides. Anyone associated with the club should be proud of their performance on Sunday and moving forward, this team has massive, massive potential so we should all be excited.”\n\n-Calum McFarlane; \n\nPreviously: Last season, we went to Craven Cottage on a low and came back on an absolute high. Tyrique George’s late equalizer and Pedro Neto’s even-later winner galvanized the team into a scorching hot run of form and results, culminating in not only a top-four finish but winning the FIFA Club World Cup later that summer.",

    "description": "Juve’s most maligned player was key as Juve coasted to a win at an old bogey ground.",
    "fullText": "All of three days ago, Juventus dominated their opponent, but didn’t use that dominance properly and ended up dropping points when they couldn’t convert that dominance to goals.\n\nFor a while, Tuesday night’s game against Sassuolo looked like it would be similar. Juve had at least managed to take score first after Pierre Kalulu’s cross was redirected by former Juve NextGen prospect Tarik Muharemovic into his own net 15 minutes in. But, despite once again sealing their opponents into their own half and refusing to let them out, Juventus once again couldn’t put the ball back into the net, seemingly leaving themselves open to paying a heavy price for a single mistake the way they had against Lecce.\n\nThe fact that they were at the Mapei Stadium — a place that Juve had lost two straight years before the Neroverdi spent last year in Serie B — jangled the nerves all the more.\n\nBut there were two big differences between Tuesday and Saturday. The first is that Juve didn’t make any boneheaded mistakes. The second was that Jonathan David — their most maligned player after his catastrophic penalty miss over the weekend — had his first true big game in a Juventus shirt, capping off an effective performance with an assist and a goal within two minutes of each other to propel the Bianconeri to a 3-0 victory to end the andata and match Roma and Como, who had both won earlier in the day, in order to stay ahead in the race for fourth place.\n\nLuciano Spalletti was unable to carry the 4-2-3-1 formation he used against Lecce over to Tuesday’s match because of injuries at the back. Lloyd Kelly and Francisco Conceição had taken minor knocks on Saturday and weren’t risked on the short turnaround, while Daniele Rugani, Federico Gatti, Jonas Rouhi, Dusan Vlahovic, and Arkadiusz Milik all joined them on the treatment table. With the defense stretched thin, Spalletti was forced to return to the 3-4-2-1. Michele Di Gregorio started in goal, fronted by Kalulu, Bremer, and Teun Koopmeiners. Weston McKennie and Andrea Cambiaso played at wing-back, sandwiching the usual midfield of Manuel Locatelli and Khéphren Thuram. Fabio Miretti joined Kenan Yildiz backing up David in attack.\n\nSassuolo was managed by former Juve defender and Italy legend Fabio Grosso, who was marking his 400th game as a first-team manager. He was missing a couple of his more recongnizable names, chief among them Domenico Berardi. Cristian Volpato, Filippo Romagna, Daniele Boloca, and Edoardo Pierangolo were also injured, and Woyo Coulibaly was playing for Mali at AFCON. Grosso deployed a 4-3-3, backstopped by goalkeeper Arijanet Muric. Sebastian Walukeiwicz, Jay Idzes, Muharemovic, and Josh Doig made up the back four. Ismaël Koné, Edoardo Iannoni, and Nemanja Matic made up the midfield, while Kristian Thorstvedt and Armand Laurienté flanked Andrea Pinamonti in the attacking trident.\n\nIt was actually Sassuolo who registered the first two shots of the game after Juve started fairly sloppily. Walukeiwicz poked a corner over less than two minutes in, and Thorstvedt jumped a bad pass only to fire wide two minutes after that. But soon the general flow of the game became quite clear: Juve going forward, Sassuolo struggling to break out.\n\nIn the ninth minute Yildiz stole the ball from Walukeiwicz at the corner of the box and tried to surprise Muric at the near post, but the keeper was able to parry before Cambiaso put the rebound into the side netting from a tight angle. David found Thuram for the first of his six (six!) key passes on the night a few minutes later, but the Frenchman’s shot went righ at Muric.\n\nBut the Kosovar keeper could do nothing just after the quarter-hour mark, when Kalulu came forward to aid the attack and sent in a cross. He was looking for the run of Miretti in the middle, but his ball was met by the head of Muharemovic, who was trying to clear but instead glanced it into his own net, far from anywhere where Muric could hope to intervene. The promising young center-back’s mistake gave Juve what they’d never managed at the Allianz over the weekend: a lead.\n\nThe next task was to consolidate that lead — which the team had problems doing. David tried to twist a ball in at a tight angle from the right but couldn’t beat Muric, while Yildiz had two shots denied sandwiched around the half-hour mark. The young Turk had another opportunity five minutes before the break, this time hitting a powerful shot across goal that Muric again had to parry, lucky to hit it right at Idzes, who reacted well to clear.\n\nJuve came out of the gate looking to kill the game off, but were still having issues doing just that. Locatelli must have thought he’d spotted Muric off his line a few minutes after kickoff, because he hit a long-distance lob that flew well over the goal, beforee Thuram was sent down the left channel but elected to go himself instead of feeding one of three runners to his right, forcing a relatively easy save out of Muric. Miretti joined the effort and stabbed a square pass from David over from inside the box, and it looked as though the frustration might be starting to mount.\n\nBut only two minutes later, David connected with Miretti again, to much better results. McKennie chested a long ball down and passed it to David, who quickly side-footed the ball into the path of Miretti. He tore past Muharemovic and into the right channel, then ripped the ball past Muric and into the far side of the net. It was his first goal in 10 months and his first goal for Juventus in nearly two years.\n\nWithin 109 seconds, David had stomped out any chance the hosts might’ve had for a comeback. Pressure from the Canadian forced Idzes into a horrific back pass that the striker pounced on. He dribbled the ball around Muric and kept his cool as he slotted home past Walukeiwicz’s feeble attempt to swipe it off the line. The unity of the team then showed out. After so much criticism—as well as reports that David was an outsider in the locker room—the entire team, on the field and on the bench, mobbed him. Even Spalletti ran downfield to celebrate with the man he’d shown a vote of confidence by starting him again.\n\nHe almost added another seconds later when another bad turnover in the Sassuolo box fell to him, but this time he fired high. But at that point it mattered little—the game was well and truly over. Both sides knew they were simply playing out the stretch, and the rhythm of the game reflected it. Sassuolo did finally put a shot on target in the 84th minute when Nicholas Pierini tested Di Gregorio from a direct free kick, then Luca Lipani added another on the ensuing corner that Juve’s keeper again met with a parry.\n\nThere was little to do for the defense besides that, and as the final whistle blared out across the Mapei Stadium, the Bianconeri walked toward the traveling fans to celebrate their first win at the ground since 2022, and to closing out the andata in style.",

    "fullText": "Arizona women’s basketball won its first Big 12 game of the Becky Burke era Tuesday night by taking down BYU at McKale Center. For a team that had dropped its first three conferences games, the victory was much-needed.\n\nWhat changed Tuesday? Burke credited the performance to the team’s all-around effort level.\n\n“BYU plays extremely hard. We played harder,” Burke said. “We’re capable of it. We’ve shown it now. Now that’s the standard.”\n\nNow that Arizona has its first Big 12 win in the bag, Burke believes her team is capable of playing with the same type of energy on a nightly basis.\n\n“Because I think this is a group that when they when they do something well, and get rewarded for it and see the fruits of their labor, I think they then want to do more of it,” Burke said.“\n\nOur recap of the game can be found here. Below is what Burke, Nora Francois, Sumayah Sugapong and Tanyuel Welch had to say after the game.\n\nBurke on her overall thoughts on the win: “I am overjoyed. I’m so excited for our group. You know, we needed this. We worked our butts off for this. That’s a really, really, really good team. I’ve played, I’ve won games, I’ve done it. Like I am so happy for them. For a lot of these, literally, all three of these guys to win their first Power 4 games, especially here in Arizona, it’s really special. And we were just talking through the first three games of big 12 play. We just got to keep battling, stay the course, and when we get our first one, what that is going to do for this team, to just rejuvenate them and build that confidence, that they can go win games if we play the way that we play today. So shout out to our staff and coach Julie game plan was absolutely phenomenal. Shout out to them for executing it to perfection and pairing that with being the hardest game. You know, our effort that was, that was they’ve played the hardest they’ve played all season tonight. So I could not be more happy for these guys.”\n\nOn Arizona’s defensive intensity: “Well we forced them into 27 turnovers. I didn’t think it was going to be that high, but, like, I knew we could turn them over. Oheir offense is very, very, very ball screen oriented. There’s one, two, maybe three on every possession. A lot of people have just been letting them use ball screens this year, and they’re so good at picking you apart. They’ll take anything you give them off ball screens. So we just said we’re gonna shake some stuff up. We’re not gonna let them use ball screens and do what they want. We’re going to dictate defensively. Our ball pressure, and then Nora hedged ball screens for 40 minutes like I’ve never seen before, you know. So it was just a tremendous effort by them, but to force a minute 27 turnovers, it’s really hard to win when you turn the ball over that many times. So just just credit to our group for doing that and causing those.”\n\nOn asking Francois to hedging ball screens, and what Francois brought offensively: “We had a horrible trip back from Texas Tech, and we’re getting off the plane, and we prepped on the airplane for the next one, and Nora is getting off. And I’m like, Nora, can you hedge a ball screen? She’s like, ‘Very well, actually.’ I’m like, okay, so she proved herself right today. What she did on the defensive end, I think, like, had just helped her flow offensively. I mean, she was very effective on the defensive end. It’s easy when you guard and you do what you’re supposed to do on that end, to have some juice and to have, like, to go sprint to screens. It was really nice to see. And our guards fed her the ball, like, extremely well. She created for herself some. Our guards created for her some. And then she was finishing today, which is the most encouraging thing, you know, because she’s gonna make a couple, she’s gonna miss a couple. That’s kind of what we’ve been living with all year. But she was making them today, and the focus was there. She would say the same thing, and she probably will, but like, credit to the guards too. Nora was screening, rolling and posting, and we were feeding her. like we just kept going to what was working. And that’s just like, such, such high IQ by our players, without me having to like, walk them through every little thing.”\n\nOn getting Sugapong back in the lineup: “Yeah, a lot of it’s been like game plan. size of opponents. I told Sumayah the other day, it’s really hard to have you and Lani on the floor at the same time, given this game plan and how aggressive we were going to be and how they’re very guard oriented. We knew Sumayah could play a ton of this game, and she did, you know. So it’s really not a Sumayah thing, it’s a game plan, personnel on the other teams thing, you know. So it was, it was nice to see her go out there and just pick up where she left off. And the tight rotation today, I told everybody in practice like I’m going with who’s going to do what I’m asking him to do at a really high level. So if it’s five or six, the rest of the way, we’ll call plenty of timeouts, we’ll get plenty of treatment, and we’ll see what these guys got. But the five or six that played the heavy minutes tonight were the ones that were getting it done. So if it’s not broke, I’m not going to fix it.”\n\nOn the number of hustle plays and playing with a higher effort level: “Yeah, the chart is in my brain. When I see our players on the floor, left and right, it fires me up. Like that is who we have to be. Our slogan is sleeves up. They rolled their sleeves up today. Got dirty like there was no question that we played harder. And BYU plays extremely hard. We played harder. We’re capable of it. We’ve shown it now. Now that’s the standard. Like, we have to be that team. We’ve proven, like we did tonight, that if we’re that team and we can play that hard every night, we’ll give ourselves a chance every single time. These kind of 50/50 games we’ll win. These will sneak a couple that we’re not supposed to win, you know, but we have to play this hard and harder the rest of the way. You know, you saw a little two, two minute stretch. We didn’t play super hard. What happened? Boom, 14 to 4 run. We have to play hard the rest of the season. They can rest in April, like, we have to play hard. So, but I like, to your point, there was a zero question. And the fans love it. I mean, I loved, like, I loved doing that stuff, because I love the fans cheering for me like that on the floor. You want them to, like, cheer for you, right? Like, you want to feel good. You want like, yeah, we got it. We got to do that stuff, especially in the atmosphere that we have here. It just fires everybody up.”\n\nOn the support of the fanbase and the significance of beating BYU: “This is how special this place is. I mean, we just started conference play 0-3 and this might have been one of our biggest crowds. That is why I took this job there. We’re obviously going to battle and fight this year and make everybody proud and do a great job and have a lot of momentum. But like, we want to recruit the best players in the country here. We want to win a national championship here. Why would somebody not want to come to a place that, when we’re 0-3 in the Big 12, you still get to play in front of 8,000 people? It is an incredibly unique place when it comes to that. I was excited. I knew we were going to get one. It was a matter of when it was. Because I think this is a group that when they when they do something well, and get rewarded for it and see the fruits of their labor, I think they then want to do more of it. And I think they then want to continue what they did to have that success. Yeah, it was really hard for us to get it right? Three games. But like now that they’ve got it, I think they’re going to be locked in for the UCF game plan the same way that they were for this one. I think they’re going to trust us a little bit more than if we do exactly what we’re asking them to do, that, hey, it actually worked. That’s what type of group this is. So if they needed one to go get two or three in these next few, then I’m glad we kind of got the monkey off our back a little bit. But I told them, if you get even a little bit complacent and you think because you beat BYU that we’ve arrived, you’re gonna drop one on Saturday. This is an every night league, and we can’t take our foot off the gas at all.”\n\nOn how the team can offset rebounding struggles: “We’re boxing out. It’s the pursuit to go get it after we box out. There wasn’t a whole lot of shot, like we turned them over 27 times. So that’s 27 shots. They didn’t take for us to rebound it. So I think some of those stats are a little bit skewed sometimes. Don’t get me wrong, we’re not a great rebounding team ever, but yeah, I’d rather live steals than rebounds in this game, particularly, T goes and snatches a bunch. But we have to be better at hitting and going and pursuing the ball.”\n\nOn preparing for UCF: “I don’t talk or think about the next team until we take care of business with the first team. You look at scores in the league, it’s just what we do, right? But no, I don’t have to know anything about them to know that we need to bring our best on Saturday. We need to play high level basketball. We need to build off this momentum. We need to be extremely locked in.”\n\nOn the possibility of starting Big 12 play 2-3: “It would be huge. These are so hard earned and hard to get. They know how hard that win was out there? Like, I’m glad they have an off day tomorrow, because they need it, you know? So it’s big, but we could also be 1-4, so they got to be locked.”\n\nFrancois on executing on defense, particularly hedges: “So actually, on the plane leaving our last game, coach asked me, she’s like, ‘Nora, do you know how to hedge?’ I was like, ‘This is my time to shine. This is my time.’ Definitely very familiar with hard hedging, soft hedging, anything. Drop coverage is fine, but just being prepared for that, going into practice, knowing that I’m gonna have my moments. That was really the biggest adjustment.”\n\nOn knocking the ball away in late defensive stand: “I read the inbounder’s eyes, and she was trying so hard not to look at my person. So I was like, All right, it’s coming to her. So I just got her arm up, tipped it, thankfully. Sumayah turned around, secured it and yeah.”\n\nOn her chemistry with Lani Cornfield: “I had to make an adjustment. I’m used to picking and rolling and putting my hand up to get the ball up here, but with Lani, it’s a lot of bounce passes, so making sure you know your hands are ready. Yeah, because she’ll find you. She’ll find you.”\n\nSugapong on going 9-9 from the free throw line: “My teammates trusts me with the ball down this stretch, which does a lot for my confidence. And then, you know, all the hours in the gym, just getting a free throws and free throws, that’s what gave me the confidence to step up those shots and knock them down.“\n\nOn staying ready when she wasn’t playing as much: “Yeah, just mentally staying locked in. I mean, I trust the coaches their game plan going into every game. So just for sure just staying locked in, being ready when my number’s called.”\n\nWelch on the importance of the home crowd: “One thing I can say, after being on the road for two games, we definitely missed being at home and having those fans. It don’t matter what’s going on in the game. We could be down, we could be up, we could be having, like, a bad stretch, the other team could have a stretch, but they really helped change the momentum for us. You know, we get a little stop and they’ll make it seem like we just won the championship. So a little stuff like that really, really helps our team.”\n\nOn being healthy and having six straight games in double figures: “The beginning the season, I had a concussion. You know, I had to work my way back in, work back from my spot. So I just took pride and wanted to be on the floor. I do whatever it takes to help my team. As you can see, I rebounded really well tonight, and I feel like that’s what we needed the most. BYU is really good at crashing the boards as far as offenses, so I made sure I secured it. And as far as my performance go, I just feel like I play a big role for this team, whether I’m scoring or not. On both ends of the floor, offensively and defensively, I set the tone. So with that being said, I have to be there. I have to be present for my team. Also like to use my voice and keep us together and huddle and all that. So yeah, just using that energy and letting my hard work show.”\n\nOn staying locked in: “I mean, now that we got our first one, I feel like it would give us a lot more momentum going into these next ones. I feel like we all can agree that tonight was fun. We enjoyed the game. So why wouldn’t we want to just keep growing from here, you know, making it exciting and growing together and just learning throughout the season. So I feel like this win tonight would really help.”\n\nOn what it takes to maintain defensive energy: “Well, you got to do it or you’re coming out the game. So I feel like that’s the first part of it. And I mean, those are the type of plays that, if we’re not going offensively, those turn into transition points. There’s just type of plays we need to win games, and everybody wants to win so everybody’s out there playing 100%.”",

    "fullText": "It’s been another frustrating season for Federico Chiesa.\n\nAlthough the Italian winger has made himself a crowd favourite throughout his short time at Anfield he has been unable to win over Arne Slot decisively.\n\nUsed sparingly during the 2024/25 Premier League title-winning campaign, Chiesa has admittedly played more this term.\n\nHe fought back during the summer to become a first-team option for Slot - but he has only managed one Premier League start in the season to this point.\n\nAs a result of his lack of game time, it’s been suggested that the 28-year-old could be moving back to Serie A.\n\nRoma have been mentioned as possible suitors but now it seems that Liverpool could be willing to do business with Juventus over a potential deal.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nSporting director Richard Hughes signed Chiesa from Juventus for £12m back in September 2024 with the Italy international inking a deal until 2028.\n\nAnd according to a report on Sky Sports the Anfield club would be willing to offload Chiesa this January - but there is one condition attached.\n\nThe English side will NOT entertain a loan move for Chiesa but would like to sell him on a permanent basis instead.\n\n“Juventus has inquired with the player's representatives to see if there are any opportunities to bring him back to Italy on loan. Liverpool has been open to the move, but only on a permanent basis,” the report reads.\n\nThe source also mentions that Napoli have been in touch about a loan move.\n\nAnd according to Gazzetta dello Sport Chiesa has now responded to Juventus’ transfer interest - and WOULD be willing to move back to Turin this winter.\n\n“After hearing the Italian winger's openness to a possible return to the Bianconeri, Juventus officials have expressed their interest in welcoming the player back to Continassa, exploring whether the Reds would be willing to open negotiations in the second half of January,” the report reads.\n\nA deal could be concluded in the second half of the month owing to Liverpool’s shortage up top right now.\n\nHugo Ekitike has been carrying an injury, Alexander Isak is out following a broken leg and Mohamed Salah is away at AFCON. But once those issues begin to resolve we could see an exit for Chiesa materialise very rapidly.",

    "fullText": "Noodle dish is nation’s favourite comfort food and source of civic pride – but it has health risks\n\nThe road to ramen paradise ends in the unlikeliest of places. At Men Endo, located in a suburban street, next to a school and a low-rise apartment block, bowls of noodles disappear in a flurry of slurps, gulps and hurried but heartfelt exchanges of appreciation between customer and chef.\n\nOn a cold afternoon in Yamagata, a city in Japan’s northeast, the wait for a seat at Men Endo’s counter is mercifully short. Inside the door, a ticket dispenser lists myriad options, from regular shoyu (soy sauce) ramen – in small, medium or large portions – to maji soba, a soupless symphony of toppings, sauce and noodles that diners are invited to mix together with their chopsticks, along with a spoonful of spicy miso.\n\nThat Men Endo – men is from menrui, the Japanese word for noodles, and Endo is a family name – has managed to secure a loyal clientele – which today includes construction workers, couples and a solo diner from the Guardian – is no mean feat.\n\nIn Yamagata, 340km north of Tokyo, noodle fiends have around 230 establishments to choose from, with several opening their doors early for those craving comfort food.\n\n“People here don’t ask each other where they want to go for dinner, but which ramen restaurant to go to,” says Osamu Higuchi, assistant manager in Yamagata’s brand strategy section.\n\nIt is that level of dedication to eating at restaurants – as opposed to making ramen at home or grabbing a lunchtime cup of the instant variety – that has earned Yamagata, a modestly sized city of 240,000, the title of Japan’s ramen capital.\n\nThe accolade is a source of pride, its current reign the result of an aggressive campaign to outperform its closest rival, Niigata, which shocked the ramen world by taking the title in 2021.\n\nLast year, Yamagata’s households each spent an average of ¥22,389 [£106] on ramen – well ahead of second-placed Niigata on ¥16,292, according to the internal affairs ministry, which will soon announce the winner for 2025. Only the annual ranking for gyoza consumption generates similar levels of anticipation. That title currently belongs to Hamamatsu in central Japan.\n\n“When Niigata won it was a huge shock,” says Higuchi. “Eating ramen is a big part of daily life here … to be honest it hurt our feelings.”\n\nBut the city’s appetite for ramen has its drawbacks. Frequent consumption can increase health risks, mainly due to the soup’s high salt content, according to a study of almost 7,000 people aged 40 and over led by Yamagata University. People who have the dish three or more times a week have a mortality risk 1.52 times higher than those who eat it once or twice a week, according to the four-year study published in October in the Journal of Nutrition, Health and Aging.\n\nThe experts added, however, that the statistics did not mean regular consumption was a “definite danger”, given that those most at risk possibly indulged in other habits “common among frequent ramen” eaters, such as excessive overall salt intake, drinking and smoking.\n\n“I’ve been trying not to drink all of the soup, but it’s very moreish, and the chefs go to a lot of effort to make it so it feels rude to leave any,” says Higuchi who, after consulting a smartphone app, announces he has polished off 225 bowls of ramen so far this year. “That said, households here spend an average of about ¥2,000 a month on ramen … it’s not that much when you think about it.”\n\nHealth risks aside, no Japanese dish commands as much loyalty, or generates as much discussion, as ramen. Popularised in Japan after the second world war – thanks to returning soldiers who fondly recalled how it had sustained them in Japanese-occupied China – it became a symbol of recovery and resilience.\n\nRamen critic Rikiya Yamaji believes Yamagata has perfected the art of adapting what was originally a Chinese dish to suit the Japanese palate. “Ramen has been around in Japan since the Meiji era [1868-1912], but became particularly popular when it was served at food stalls after the war,” said Yamaji, who gets through 30 bowls a month and has been known to visit several ramen shops a day.\n\n“A distinctive feature of Japanese food culture is its ability to ‘localise’ dishes introduced from overseas … curry rice is a good example. In the same way, ramen has evolved into new food culture with a uniquely Japanese approach, like Tex-Mex cuisine in the US. It used to be considered cheap and filling, and it’s still convenient and inexpensive, but these days there is more emphasis on quality and fusion ingredients.”\n\nThe noodle dish with humble origins is now the yardstick by which Japan’s regions measure their culinary caché, triggering fierce rivalries and competing claims to have achieved the perfect marriage of soup, noodles and toppings. Varieties range from miso ramen in the far north, to those sitting in a pale but pungent pork-based broth in the deep south.\n\nThe roots of Yamagata’s obsession lie in the aftermath of the 1923 Great Kantō Earthquake, which killed more than 100,000 people in the Tokyo area. Ramen chefs who fled the destroyed capital to work at soba restaurants in Yamagata shared their ramen-making skills and found a population with an appetite for steaming hot noodles to get them through the city’s bitterly cold winters. Households would order ramen, rather than trays of sushi, to serve to guests – a custom that gave children an early introduction to a dish they continued to eat into adulthood.\n\nAfter it ceded its title to Niigata a few years ago, ramen shop owners and officials in Yamagata teamed up to create an organisation dedicated to re-establishing the city as Japan’s “ramen kingdom”.\n\nHiguchi is confident Yamagata will retain the title when the government announces the 2025 results in early February. “If our ramen businesses do well, then so does the local economy – farmers and soy sauce manufacturers, even the companies that produce hot towels for restaurants,” he says. “I don’t think it’s going too far to say that Yamagata is ramen.”",

    "fullText": "Deal indicates Venezuelan government is responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention\n\nDonald Trump has said Venezuela will be “turning over” $2bn worth of Venezuelan crude to the United States, a flagship negotiation that would divert supplies from China while helping Venezuela avoid deeper oil production cuts.\n\n“This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!” Trump said in a post online.\n\nVenezuelan government officials and state company PDVSA did not provide comment.\n\nVenezuela has millions of barrels of oil loaded on tankers and in storage tanks that it has been unable to ship due to the blockade imposed by Trump, as part of the pressure campaign that culminated in the toppling of Nicolás Maduro who was seized from his country by US forces over the weekend.\n\nTop Venezuelan officials have called Maduro’s capture a kidnapping and accused the US of trying to steal the country’s vast oil reserver, however Tuesday’s agreement is a strong sign that the government is responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention.\n\nTrump has said he wants interim president Delcy Rodríguez to give the US and private companies “total access” to Venezuela’s oil industry.\n\nUS energy secretary Chris Wright is in charge of executing the deal, Trump said, adding that the oil will be taken from ships and sent directly to US ports. Supplying the trapped crude to the US could initially require reallocating cargoes originally bound for China, two sources had told Reuters earlier on Tuesday.\n\nChina has been Venezuela’s top buyer in the last decade and especially since the United States imposed sanctions on companies involved in oil trade with Venezuela in 2020.\n\nUS crude prices fell more than 1.5% after Trump’s announcement, with the agreement expected to increase the volume of Venezuelan oil exported to the US. That flow of oil is currently controlled entirely by Chevron, PDVSA’s main joint venture partner, under a US authorisation.\n\nChevron, which has been exporting between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan oil to the US, is the only company that has been loading and shipping crude without interruption from the South American country in recent weeks under the blockade.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Venezuela would have any access to proceeds from the supply. Sanctions mean PDVSA is excluded from the global financial system, its bank accounts are frozen and it is blocked from executing transactions in US dollars\n\nHours before Trump’s announcement on Tuesday, Rodríguez hardened her tone against the US, saying in a televised address that “no external agent governs Venezuela” – a clear rebuttal to the US president’s claim that, after the capture of Maduro, the US would now run the South American country.\n\nIt marked another shift in tone from Maduro’s former vice-president. After being sworn in as president by Venezuela’s supreme court on Saturday, Rodríguez released a conciliatory statement late on Sunday in which she “invited the US government to work together on an agenda of cooperation”.\n\nIn Tuesday’s address, however, Rodríguez reverted to harsher language, describing Saturday’s strike – the first large-scale US military operation on South American soil – as a “terrible military aggression” and a “criminal attack” whose “absolutely illegal outcome, in violation of international law”, was the “kidnapping” of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.\n\n“We are a people who do not surrender, who do not give up, and we are here, governing together with the people. The government of Venezuela rules in our country – no one else. There is no external agent governing Venezuela. It is Venezuela, its constitutional government, and the consolidated power of the people,” said Rodríguez, who had served as Maduro’s vice-president since 2018.",

    "title": "Bill to Eliminate H-1B Visa Program Introduced in Congress",
    "description": "The bill introduced by Marjorie Taylor Greene would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to eliminate the H-1B visa program.",
    "fullText": "A bill that would \"eliminate the H-1B program,\" which helps U.S. companies hire highly skilled foreign workers, was among Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene's final two final pieces of proposed legislation, new records show.\n\nThe Republican of Georgia introduced the bill and another to mandate \"photo identification and proof of United States citizenship to vote in Federal elections\" on Friday.\n\nShe served her final day in Congress for Georgia's 14th district on Monday, following her a high-profile break with President Donald Trump over issues such as health care, the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files and foreign policy.\n\nThe H1-B visa program has been under heavy scrutiny during President Trump's second term.\n\nIn September, Trump ordered a controversial $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas, sparking ongoing legal challenges. In court papers, Trump's administration argued the substantial increase is necessary to protect American jobs and fund border security, while critics—including some business groups, educators and state governments—warned it would stifle innovation, competitiveness, and specialized fields like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and medicine.\n\nGreene's bill goes one step further than the government's position, seeking to end the program entirely.\n\nThe clash brings to the forefront the challenges Trump faces as he seeks to balance economic pragmatism with the “America First” sentiments of his political base, which Greene has argued are being ignored by Trump's administration.\n\nThe H-1B visa program allows employers to sponsor foreign professionals for jobs that require specialized skills, most commonly in technology, engineering, and science.\n\nEach year, the government issues 85,000 new H-1B visas, including 20,000 reserved for workers with advanced degrees from U.S. universities. Demand for the visas regularly exceeds supply, triggering an annual lottery. Indian nationals make up a large share of recipients.\n\nGreene first touted a H-1B program ban in September, writing on X: \"I am introducing a bill to END the mass replacement of American workers by aggressively phasing out the H1B program. Big Tech, AI giants, hospitals, and industries across the board have abused the H-1B system to cut out our own people. Americans are the most talented people in the world, and I have full faith in the American people. I serve Americans only, and I will ALWAYS put Americans first.\"\n\nRepresentative Beth Van Duyne, the Republican of Texas, last month also called for a total ban on the visas as part of a broader push to overhaul the U.S. immigration system, telling conservative commentator Benny Johnson politicians had overlooked the “unintended consequences” of programs like H-1B.\n\nMeanwhile, a federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration may proceed with imposing a $100,000 fee on new H1B visa applications. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which brought a legal challenge over concerns the fee would disrupt the framework established by Congress and impose high costs on U.S. businesses, last week launched an appeal over the ruling.\n\n\"These harms to American businesses will also be a boon to America’s economic rivals, who will surely welcome the talent no longer able to accept work in the United States,\" the business group said in its initial October lawsuit. \"That is a competitive edge that foreign employers might never cede back.\"\n\nSeparately, a coalition of 20 states, spearheaded by Washington Attorney General Nick Brown and California and Massachusetts' Attorneys General, challenged the fee’s legality under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), arguing the required notice-and-comment process was bypassed, and the fee was arbitrarily set unrelated to administrative costs.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State expanded its screening process for H-1B applicants and their dependents last month, requiring applicants to make social media accounts publicly accessible as part of routine vetting. Officials said the move was aimed at preventing abuse of the system.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has finalized new rules that will reshape the H-1B visa lottery. Beginning in 2027, applicants would no longer have equal chances of selection; instead, the system would prioritize higher-paid workers within each occupation. Federal officials said the change is intended to favor highly skilled applicants and respond to concerns about visa misuse and the displacement of U.S. workers.\n\nRepresentative Beth Van Duyne, the Republican of Texas, told conservative commentator Benny Johnson on December 17: “That H-1B visa program has got to either stop right now until we understand the amount of just how it’s being taken advantage of, or redone so it doesn't exist.\"\n\nStuart Anderson, executive director at the National Foundation for American Policy, responding to a decline in the number of H-1B visas approved for Indian-based companies, according to a National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) analysis of government data, told Newsweek: \"H-1B visas are important because they are typically the only way to hire a high-skilled foreign national long term in the United States, and approximately 70% of full-time graduate students in key science and technology fields at U.S. schools are international students.”\n\nUnited States Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesperson Matthew Tragesser, in a December 23 press release announcing H-1B lotttery changes: \"The new weighted selection will better serve Congress’ intent for the H-1B program and strengthen America’s competitiveness by incentivizing American employers to petition for higher-paid, higher-skilled foreign workers. With these regulatory changes and others in the future, we will continue to update the H-1B program to help American businesses without allowing the abuse that was harming American workers.”\n\nGreen's amendment has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee, along with the Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means committees.",

    "description": "Mammals aren’t known for the ocular regenerative powers, but a new study shows that nature has a few tricks up its sleeve.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this study:\n\nBillions of people globally experience some kind of vision impairment, with many millions living with near or total blindness. With such an astounding number of people functionally lacking our most primary sense for navigating through the world, scientists have eagerly pursued methods to restore human vision. But while other members of the animal kingdom display remarkable methods of vision regeneration, mammals largely lack these restorative powers.\n\nHowever, we might not be completely without biological advantages, and scientists hope that understanding the ways our body does restore some level of vision after injury could lead to therapies for vision-based maladies.\n\nWithin the human body, it’s mostly seen as a given that neurons do not regenerate once damage. But this didn’t explain how people appeared to regain some ability, including vision, after a traumatic injury. To investigate, scientists from Johns Hopkins University in Maryland explored what happens between connections of cells in the visual system and neurons in the brain in mice after an injury. While neurons didn’t regrow, the researchers did notice that surviving cells increased branching, allowing for more connections in the brain. Eventually, this branching process—known as “sprouting”—resulted in nearly the same number of connections as before the injury. The results of this study were published in the journal JNeurosci.\n\n“The central nervous system is characterized by its limited regenerative potential, yet striking examples of functional recovery after injury in animal models and humans highlight its capacity for repair,” the authors wrote. “Here we […] explore, for the first time, the evolution of structural and functional changes in the terminal fields of the injured visual system.”\n\nWhile the mice in the study did recover to an extent, the scientists were surprised to see that recovery wasn’t uniform across sexes. Male mice showed enhanced recuperative abilities, while female mice experienced slower and incomplete repair by comparison. While an unexplained discovery, the phenomenon isn’t wholly unexpected.\n\n“Women experience more lingering symptoms from concussion or brain injury than men,” Johns Hopkins University’s Athanasios Alexandris, the lead author of the study, said in a press statement. “Understanding the mechanism behind the branch sprouting we observed—and what delays or prevents this mechanism in females—could eventually point toward strategies to promote recovery from traumatic or other forms of neural injury.”\n\nWhile the mammalian body offers effective strategies for restoring vision, scientists are looking across the entire animal kingdom for methods of ocular regeneration. In August of 2025, scientists reported on the inner genetic workings of the apple snail’s eye-restoring abilities, and a few months prior, another team achieved partial vision restoration in mice by leveraging the evolutionary strategies of zebrafish.\n\nFor now, humans lack methods for fully regenerating cells that can completely restore our much-needed vision. But scientists are eagerly hunting for clues to unlock this biological secret—whether in far-flung phylums or within our own bodies.\n\nDarren lives in Portland, has a cat, and writes/edits about sci-fi and how our world works.

    "fullText": "Jan 6 (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. heating, ventilation and air conditioning-related companies dropped on Tuesday after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ​said that the company's upcoming chips could significantly reduce cooling ‌requirements in data centers.\n\nJohnson Controls International dropped 7.5% to $112.40 and Trane Technologies lost 5.3% to $370.40. ‌Both stocks hit multi-month lows and were among the biggest percentage decliners on the S&P 500.\n\nSpeaking at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas on Monday, Huang said Nvidia's next generation of chips is in \"full production.\" ⁠The Vera Rubin platform, ‌made up of six separate Nvidia chips, is expected to debut later this year.\n\nWhen talking about the cooling ‍requirements, Huang said that \"no water chillers are necessary for data centres.\"\n\nBarclays analysts said in a note led by Julian Mitchell that \"given the primacy of Nvidia to ​the whole AI ecosystem, one should not take their comments lightly, ‌although they seem rather dramatic at first glance.\"\n\nThe analysts said the companies that could be most affected include Johnson Controls International, Trane Technologies and Carrier Global.\n\nThey estimate that data centers represent a low-double-digit percentage of total sales for Johnson Controls and data centers account for about 10% ⁠and 5% of sales for Trane Technologies ​and Carrier Global, respectively.\n\nCarrier Global shares ​fell 1.1%.\n\nThe analysts also highlighted nVent Electric could benefit from these developments as it has \"no presence in space cooling/chillers/air handling\" ‍but has a \"decent ⁠position in data center liquid cooling.\"\n\nData center power equipment maker Vertiv Holdings could also benefit due to its \"strong historical position in ⁠precision air cooling\" and \"strong position in liquid cooling,\" the analysts said.\n\nVertiv shares were down ‌2.1%, while nVent shares edged 0.5% higher.",

    "description": "\"Projected to face severe climatic challenges.\"",
    "fullText": "New research has found that birds that have adapted to mountainous regions may be at risk amid a shifting climate, but hybridized birds with genes from multiple species could have a better chance of adapting.\n\nA study led by researchers at the Institute of Zoology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and published in the journal Nature Climate Change, analyzed three closely related bird species that live in the Sino-Himalayan mountains, as detailed in an academy report posted by Phys.org.\n\nThe researchers ran simulations and found that if these birds mate and produce hybrid offspring, it could reduce their vulnerability to climate change over several generations. This could help them adapt to harsher conditions and future climate shifts.\n\nThese bird species began diverging 220,000 years ago, according to the study, and live in distinct niches within the same region. Because of those contrasting environments, they have adapted unique survival mechanisms — yet they are all still under threat.\n\n\"Despite these specializations, all three species are projected to face severe climatic challenges, potentially losing 44% to 69% of their suitable habitats,\" the authors said, per Phys.org, sharing the academy report.\n\nThe birds have been mostly geographically isolated, but some contact zones exist that could make hybridization possible.\n\nEven with their adaptations to their environments and the potential for hybrid species to carry multiple beneficial genetic traits, they are still vulnerable to climate shifts — though hybrid birds are projected as less so than nonhybridized counterparts.\n\nThe rapid warming of the planet is changing human beings, wildlife, and the environment as we know it. This research provides another example of how animals are being forced to adapt to changing conditions.\n\nWarmer temperatures are melting ice in the Arctic and on mountains, shrinking habitats, and depleting resources for wildlife.\n\nAnimals can change their migration patterns and venture outside their normal regions to search for food and habitable climates, throwing off ecological balance in the process.\n\nDo you worry about the longevity of EV batteries?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"Climate change is rapidly driving environmental shifts, posing an increasing threat to global biodiversity,\" the authors said in the study.\n\nIt's not a good sign that mountainous birds may have to use hybridization to survive the effects of climate change over the long term, but it's important for researchers to know what's possible in order to save vital ecosystems.\n\nThe study urged better preservation of migration corridors and contact zones for these birds, which help to facilitate \"interspecific genetic material exchange\" for \"restoring population fitness.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "\"A higher ratio than generally reported.\"",
    "fullText": "It was shorts weather for Santa as parts of Iceland set record high temperatures this past Christmas Eve. Air that originated in the tropics swept across the country, helping temperatures in places surge to nearly 70 degrees on December 24.\n\nSeyðisfjörður, on the east coast of Iceland, reached a record high of 19.8 degrees Celsius (about 67.6 degrees Fahrenheit) the day before Christmas, reported The Guardian. It broke the previous record for Iceland, set on December 2, 2019, when the high reached 19.7 Celsius (about 67.5 Fahrenheit) in Öræfi, about 125 miles to the southwest of Seyðisfjörður, as the crow flies.\n\n\"This is incredibly warm for winter,\" meteorologist Einar Sveinbjörnsson posted on Facebook, per RÚV, Iceland's national public broadcasting service. \"Another station in Seyðisfjörður, located north of the head of the fjord in Vestdalur, recorded 19.4 C [about 66.9 F]. There is no reason to question these measurements.\"\n\nA \"foehn wind\" contributed to the unusual holiday heat records in Iceland, RÚV detailed. \"Foehn winds represent a special type of local wind associated with mountain systems,\" explains the National Weather Service in an online publication. \"In most mountainous areas, local winds are observed that blow over the mountain ranges and descend the slopes on the leeward side. If the down-flowing wind is warm and dry, it is called a foehn wind.\"\n\nWhile a foehn wind played a part in setting a new record high for December 24 in Iceland, a warming climate at high northern latitudes is making it easier to break records.\n\nRecords fell in Iceland this past spring too, as temperatures in some areas climbed by as much as 3 to 4 degrees Celsius (roughly 5 to 7 degrees Fahrenheit) higher than normal in May, according to The Guardian. The temperature peaked at 26.6 Celsius (about 79.9 Fahrenheit) at Egilsstaðir Airport in East Iceland on May 15.\n\nIndividual temperature records aren't alone proof of historical trends, but scientific consensus holds that human activities have raised average temperatures worldwide — and continue to do so. The effects of this warming include amplified extreme weather events that can endanger lives and livelihoods.\n\nOnly part of Iceland is north of the Arctic Circle, but our overheating planet is also having a huge impact on the Arctic, with effects spilling out into other parts of the world. Scientists say the region is warming rapidly compared to the rest of the planet.\n\n\"In recent decades, the warming in the Arctic has been much faster than in the rest of the world, a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification,\" concluded a 2022 study on the warming observed in the Arctic since 1979.\n\n\"Numerous studies report that the Arctic is warming either twice, more than twice, or even three times as fast as the globe on average,\" added the authors of that research. \"[We] show, by using several observational datasets which cover the Arctic region, that during the last 43 years the Arctic has been warming nearly four times faster than the globe, which is a higher ratio than generally reported in literature.\"\n\nAccording to the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Information's November global climate report, the Arctic had its fifth-warmest November on record, with temperatures more than 6 degrees Fahrenheit above average. At just over 5 degrees Fahrenheit above average, the period from January through November was the second-warmest such period on record for the region.\n\nHow worried are you about rising ocean levels?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nNOAA's 2025 Arctic report card highlighted several ways our warming world is impacting the region, including \"permafrost thaw influencing river chemistry, northward ocean heat transport reshaping Arctic marine ecosystems, and widespread warming leading to borealization of Arctic waters and landscapes.\"\n\n\"Transformations over the next twenty years will reshape Arctic environments and ecosystems, impact the wellbeing of Arctic residents, and influence the trajectory of the global climate system itself, which we all depend on,\" warned the authors of the report card.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "A Caracas highway is choked with cars.\n\nBut far from typical rush hour traffic, Avenida Boyacá, a highway running alongside El Avila National Park in Venezuela’s capital, has ground to a halt because masked men holding Kalashnikovs are stopping drivers and demanding to search their phones and cars.\n\nThe gangs of armed men, part of pro-Maduro militias known as Colectivos, scoured vehicles at hastily erected checkpoints following a government directive to root out Venezuelans in support of the US’s brazen capture of Nicolás Maduro.\n\nDays after the sudden decapitation of the Maduro regime, Venezuelans have been left fearing what could come next as mobs of men dressed in civilian clothes with assault rifles slung over their shoulders roam the streets.\n\n“The future is uncertain, the Colectivos have weapons, the Colombian guerrilla is already here in Venezuela, so we don’t know what’s going to happen, time will tell,” Oswaldo, a 69-year-old Venezuelan shop owner, told The Telegraph.\n\nA state of emergency decree published on Monday has sought to crack down on any public celebration of the US operation. It ordered police to “immediately begin the national search and capture of everyone involved in the promotion or support for the armed attack by the United States”.\n\nOne Venezuelan, who wished to remain anonymous, said she would no longer leave the house with her phone over fears it could be scoured for anti-Maduro texts or photographs, which could lead to her imprisonment.\n\nThe paramilitaries have already arrested 14 journalists and media workers – 11 from foreign news outlets – for hours before releasing some of them. The whereabouts of other journalists are unknown.\n\nThe presence of Colectivos, armed men who ride around on motorcycles and are used as an unofficial government arm of repression, suggests that Maduro loyalists are desperately attempting to maintain their grip on the country.\n\nVideos circulating on social media shows armed men declaring they would not allow Donald Trump and US “pigs” to come in and plunder the country’s natural resources.\n\nAnother video shows interior minister Diosdado Cabello, Mr Maduro’s closest ally, posing with a crowd of the armed militia as they shouted: “Always loyal, never traitors.”\n\nMr Cabello, who has a $50m bounty on his head for drug trafficking charges, largely controls the Colectivos.\n\nAs Mr Maduro pleaded his innocence and claimed he was a “prisoner of war” during his arraignment at Manhattan Federal Court, armed supporters said his heart and soul remained in Venezuela.\n\n“There’s enough people here, there’s enough balls here to fight for this revolution, to fight for this motherland,” said a man who identified himself as Freddy Rodriguez, a member of Cupaz, a network set up by Maduro in 2019 to control protests.\n\nOn Monday morning, most shops and businesses had reopened in Caracas and the long queues of panicked Venezuelans trying to buy provisions had dissipated.\n\nPolice and intelligence officers lined the streets in the centre of Caracas, with two main avenues closed as Delcy Rodriguez, Mr Maduro’s vice president, was sworn in by her brother, National Assembly leader Jorge Rodrigue.\n\n“I come with sorrow for the suffering inflicted upon the Venezuelan people following an illegitimate military aggression against our homeland,” she said while holding up her right hand.\n\n“I come with sorrow for the kidnapping of two heroes.”\n\nHer comments struck a different tone than on Sunday when she said she had “invited the US government to work together on an agenda of co-operation” in the wake of Mr Trump’s warning that she would pay a “very big price” should she not do as instructed.\n\nIn Caracas, Venezuelans who had initially welcomed Maduro’s capture, hoping it would lead to real change in the country, were left feeling deflated by Ms Rodriguez’s ascension and the continuation of Mr Maduro’s regime.\n\nThe country’s constitution requires an election within 30 days whenever the president becomes “permanently unavailable” to serve. However, the Supreme Court declared Mr Maduro’s absence a “temporary” one.\n\nIn such a scenario, the vice president takes over for up to 90 days – a period that can be extended to six months with a vote of the National Assembly.\n\nMaría Corina Machado, the Venezuelan Opposition leader and recent winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, said the crackdown by the militia was “really alarming” and that the country’s transition to democracy needed to happen.\n\n“Delcy Rodriguez, as you know, is one of the main architects of torture, persecution, corruption, narco-trafficking,” Ms Machado told Fox News. “She’s a main ally and liaison of ‍Russia, China, Iran, certainly not an individual who could be trusted by international investors and she’s really rejected by the Venezuelan people.”\n\nThere has been no discussion of holding democratic elections and the future of the country still hangs in the balance.\n\n“I wanted a change in government because these people have done a lot of damage to the country; they forgot they were public servants, they thought they owned the country,” shopkeeper Oswaldo said.\n\n“But now we’re at the same point, he has left and another has replaced him – Delcy Rodriguez, Diosdado Cabello and Vladimir Padrino López – they’re all still here.”\n\nSpeaking to The Telegraph in Plaza Altamira while she waited for a job interview, Aurora said she had hoped for a regime change but said her main concern was putting food on the table.\n\n“Most international leaders don’t agree with what happened, but it happened.\n\n“We saw it coming, everybody saw it coming, but nobody imagined it would happen like this, so violent. Some wished for it and others not, but there is not one country in the world that can interfere in the government and say the oil is mine, no, this is a lie, this belongs to the Venezuelan people.”\n\nWhile she pushed back at Mr Trump’s suggestion he would “run” Venezuela, Aurora, a care worker from Petare, said: “We needed a change and it was necessary and now we need a transition.”\n\n“Every birth involves pain and now we have to move forward,” she added.\n\nOthers were less accepting of the current situation.\n\n“Honestly, I think this should not have happened; he [Maduro] should be in his country governing his country,” a 59-year-old sports coach, who requested to remain anonymous, said.\n\n“All I wish for Venezuela is for things to be calm, we’ve been through so much already... I know that we weren’t well, but emotionally and physically we were more at peace.”\n\nThe thought of Mr Trump deciding what comes next for Venezuelans, as opposed to holding fair elections, has left many concerned.\n\n“I don’t agree with what Trump said, he said he was coming to run our country – I want a transition, I want elections,” Oswaldo said.\n\n“If the majority of people are in favour of Delcy, fine, if it is a transparent election and we will recognise the results peacefully – if the Chavismo wins, then ok, but if the opposition wins, they will have to recognise their defeat.”\n\nJournalists in Caracas contributed to this report but asked to withhold their names for fear of reprisals from the regime\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "For retirees, moving abroad can sound like a dream.\n\nImagine beaches, cobblestone streets and a cost of living that stretches your Social Security check further than it ever could at home. However, finding a place that’s both affordable and safe is harder than it looks.\n\nSo, I asked ChatGPT to run the numbers: Which countries offer the best balance of low cost of living and personal security?\n\nUsing the 2025 Global Peace Index, Numbeo’s Cost of Living Index, and U.S. State Department travel advisories, the AI highlighted a handful of countries that might make sense for a stress-free retirement overseas.\n\nPortugal remains one of Europe’s safest destinations. However, it’s not as inexpensive as it once was. Rising housing prices and new residency rules mean retirees need a realistic budget and proof of income.\n\nThe D7 visa still works for retirees with passive income. Applicants will have to prove they consistently earn about €870 per month (roughly $900 USD) and provide evidence of stable finances and housing, according to the residency consultancy Global Citizen Solutions.\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, smaller inland towns can offer a comfortable lifestyle for $1,500 to $2,000 per month, while Lisbon or Algarve coastal areas often cost $2,500 to $3,500. Even with higher prices, Portugal’s healthcare, safety and walkability make it appealing for retirees seeking European quality of life.\n\nTrending Now: I Asked ChatGPT for Safe and Beautiful Retirement Spots on $2.5K a Month — These 7 Surprised Me\n\nConsider This: 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up To $1K per Month From Home\n\nAI said Malaysia delivers one of the best cost-to-quality ratios in Asia. In Kuala Lumpur or Penang, a couple can live well on $1,500 to $2,000 per month and enjoy modern healthcare at a fraction of U.S. costs.\n\nThe Malaysia My Second Home (MM2H) program allows long-term residency for those meeting income or savings requirements, making it a leading pick for safety and affordability.\n\nSlovenia offers postcard landscapes, European healthcare and high safety rankings at a lower cost of living than Western Europe.\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, a retiree can live modestly on about $2,000 a month, enjoy a high standard of public services, and easily travel throughout Europe.\n\nChatGPT said Uruguay stands out in South America for its political stability, low violent-crime rate and well-run healthcare system.",

    "fullText": "Shasta Lake, the largest reservoir in California, rose more than 30 feet over the past two weeks as a series of winter storms pounded the state, according to state data.\n\nThe heavy inflow over the holidays, with Shasta Lake rising 10 feet alone between Friday and Monday, pushed water levels at the sprawling Northern California reservoir to nearly 80% of capacity, which is well above what it typically holds this early in the rainy season. And the runoff is still coming in, albeit at a slower rate.\n\nCalifornia reservoir levels: Charts show water supply across the state\n\nWhile winter is still young and California's water picture won't be clear for months, the recent replenishment of Shasta Lake, as well as other major reservoirs, is welcome news for cities and farms across the state, which rely on the water that fills these giant storage facilities between fall and spring.\n\n\"Reservoirs on the whole are running ahead of average, which is good,\" said Michael Anderson, state climatologist at the California Department of Water Resources, in a report Tuesday to the State Water Resources Control Board.\n\nPrior to the holidays, water managers were getting nervous after a mostly dry start to the state's peak wet season, which runs from December to March. But starting just before Christmas, an extremely wet pattern locked in, bringing more than a foot of rain and several feet of snow to parts of California over a two-week period.\n\n\"Right around the Christmas holiday, we had over 100 hours of atmospheric river conditions in the state,\" Anderson said.\n\nAs a result, water storage at Shasta Lake climbed to 132% of average for the date, as of Monday. Storage at Lake Oroville, the state's second-largest reservoir, rose to 135% of average. Storage at Trinity Lake, the state's third-largest reservoir, hit 137% of average.\n\nHetch Hetchy Reservoir in Yosemite, which is San Francisco's primary storage facility, meanwhile, held 130% of the water it typically holds on this date.\n\nMany reservoirs have been making releases to ensure adequate space for the lingering precipitation and continuing runoff. Shasta Lake's waters were about 35 feet below the rim of the reservoir.\n\n\"We are on the receding limb of inflows with these latest systems,\" said Levi Johnson, an operations manager at the federal Bureau of Reclamation, which manages Shasta Lake. \"This will be a dynamic operation in terms of what kind of releases we have.\"\n\nThe storms appear to be mostly on their way out. The National Weather Service is forecasting dry conditions for at least the next two weeks.\n\nWhile California's water picture remains strong, water managers will be watching to see how long it is before the next rain and snow arrives and whether it's enough to maintain robust reservoir storage.\n\nAnother factor that water managers are monitoring is snowfall in the state's far north. While California's total snowpack stands at 90% of average for the date, the northern Sierra and southern Cascades are at just 67%.\n\nSnow is important, particularly in Northern California where the state's biggest reservoirs are located, because it melts and provides a source of water for reservoirs after the rainy season ends.\n\n\"We've had a lot more rain than snow,\" Anderson said.\n\nThis article originally published at California's largest reservoir surges 30 feet after recent storms.",

Police have impounded the vehicle and are serving search warrants on it as part of the ongoing investigation into the accident, Erie Police Chief Rick Lorah said Jan. 6.\n\nPolice have not identified a suspected driver, and no one had been charged in the accident as of Jan. 6.\n\nErie police have searched for the vehicle since the evening of Dec. 9, when 66-year-old Richard Gaska was struck while riding a bicycle in the area of West Eighth and Liberty streets. Investigators said the vehicle that struck Gaska was believed to have been traveling east on West Eighth Street.\n\nThe driver of the vehicle did not stop and drove off after the accident, which police said was reported at 6:53 p.m. Dec. 9. The vehicle was suspected to have damage to the front end and hood, and possibly to the windshield, investigators reported.\n\nGaska was taken to UPMC Hamot, where he was pronounced dead at 7:50 p.m. Dec. 9. Authorities were initially unable to locate any of his relatives, but eventually a relative came forward and claimed him, the Erie County Coroner's Office reported Jan. 6.\n\nMore: State police still seeking answers in fatal Waterford hit and run\n\nA few days after the accident, Erie police posted on the department's Facebook page images of the suspect vehicle taken from a security camera at West Eighth Street and the Bayfront Parkway.

    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS, Nevada, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Tuesday he does not believe China's government will make a formal declaration that it has allowed Chinese firms to import the U.S. company's ​H200 chips but that evidence will come through purchase orders.\n\n\"My expectation is that we're not expecting any press releases or ‌any large declarations,\" Huang said, after saying that demand for the H200 chips was strong among Chinese customers.\n\n\"It's just going to be purchase orders. If the purchase ‌orders come, it's because they're able to place purchase orders,\" Huang said during a press conference at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump last year reversed a longstanding ban on shipping advanced artificial intelligence chips to China, saying he would allow Nvidia to sell the H200, which was the predecessor to its current flagship \"Blackwell\" chips.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday in an interview with a JPMorgan analyst, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress ⁠said that the U.S. government is \"working feverishly\" ‌on license applications for Nvidia to ship its H200 chips to China, but that the company still does not know when they will be approved.\n\n\"We're going to wait and see what will happen,\" Kress said ‍of the applications.\n\nAt the press conference, Huang said that Nvidia is ramping up H200 chips for Chinese firms.\n\n\"The customer demand is high - quite high,\" Huang said. \"We've fired up our supply chain, and H200s are flowing through the line.\"\n\nOn Monday, Nvidia showed a sextet of new chips that it said are in ​full production to form the next \"Vera Rubin\" generation of its AI computing systems. Kress declined to say whether Nvidia was facing any ‌specific bottlenecks as it ramps up production but said \"we feel very solid\" about the state of its supply chain.\n\nNvidia has called for $500 billion in sales from its current \"Blackwell\" generation as well as the forthcoming Vera Rubin chips by the end of this year. Kress said there have \"already been discussions\" about data center buildouts with customers for 2027 but did not give sales guidance.\n\nHuang said demand is high for Nvidia products across the board.\n\n\"I'm fully expecting a really giant year for our business with TSMC,\" Huang said, referring to Taiwan Semiconductor ⁠Manufacturing Co, which makes most of Nvidia's chips.\n\nHuang also said that he plans ​a visit soon to Israel, where the company has 5,000 employees and is ​looking to double its workforce. Local media reported last month that Nvidia is in talks to buy Israeli firm AI21 Labs.",

The funds returned 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively, in December.\n\nThe firm's smaller Emerging Markets strategy was a bright spot, returning more than 15% over the year after a 1.6% gain in December, the person added. That strategy manages roughly $1 billion in assets. Brevan declined to comment.\n\nLast year was a banner year for many macro-oriented firms. Bridgewater generated the most profits in its decades of trading, a person close to the Connecticut-based fund told Business Insider, as its flagship Pure Alpha fund was up 33% in 2025. Additionally, the manager's All Weather fund was up more than 20% for the year.\n\nDiscovery Capital, the macro fund run by former Tiger Management investor Rob Citrone, returned 35.6% in 2025, a person close to the manager said. D.E.

Ripple effects from President Donald Trump's tariff policies, conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, and central bank decisions provided both stress and opportunities for funds.\n\nThis year is expected to be more of the same following Trump's decision to invade Venezuela and extradite the country's president, Nicolás Maduro, at the start of the year.",

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comments.\n\nThe current interim leader of Venezuela is Delcy Rodríguez, who was sworn in as acting president on January 5, 2026, after the US captured and detained the country's former President Nicolás Maduro, alongside his wife. Rodríguez is a longtime Maduro loyalist and originally served as the Vice President of Venezuela. She has so far not spoken out on whether she would cooperate with Trump's plan.\n\nTrump's comments build on his previous remarks that he would \"take back\" Venezuela's oil reserves and revive the country's battered energy sector, which has faced sanctions and mismanagement.\n\nTrump also previously said in an interview with NBC News that the US could reimburse American oil companies for expanding their operations in Venezuela, but he did not have an estimate on how much the subsidy would cost.\n\nEven though a larger supply could lead to lower costs for American consumers, the downward pressure on prices could disincentivize large oil companies from investing in Venezuela. It could also take years to build functioning infrastructure.\n\nVenezuela's oil production currently accounts for less than 1% of the global oil output, despite possessing the world's largest known oil reserves.",

    "fullText": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang seems like he's not losing sleep over California's proposed wealth tax.\n\nWhen Bloomberg TV's Ed Ludlow asked Huang about California's proposed 5% billionaire wealth tax in an interview that aired on Tuesday, Huang said that the potential levy hasn't crossed his mind once and that he is \"trying to build the future of AI.\"\n\n\"I've got to tell you, I have not even thought about it once,\" Huang told Ludlow. \"We chose to live in Silicon Valley, and whatever taxes they would like to apply, so be it. I'm perfectly fine with it.\"\n\n\"We work in Silicon Valley because that's where the talent pool is,\" Huang added.\n\nHuang is the eighth-wealthiest person in the world according to Forbes, which estimated his net worth at approximately $162.6 billion as of January 6. Most of Huang's wealth comes from his around 3% stake in Nvidia, which just showed off its new Vera Rubin chips at the Consumer Electronics Show.\n\nBased on his net worth as reported by Forbes, a 5% tax on his total wealth would amount to more than $8 billion, to be paid over five years, according to the proposed plan.\n\nThe California wealth tax was proposed by the SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West in order to offset anticipated budget cuts to healthcare, education, and food assistance.\n\nA wealth tax is different from an income tax and is a levy on an individual's entire net worth instead of annual income. The union estimates that the one-time tax will bring in $100 billion over five years for the state and apply to the around 200 billionaires who are residents of California.\n\nThe proposal is still very far from reality and would need 870,000 signatures to even make it to the ballot in November 2026, where it would then be voted on or rejected by California voters.\n\nBillionaires from Palmer Luckey to David Sacks have already voiced their full-throated disapproval.\n\nAccording to filings viewed by Business Insider, Larry Page, the Google cofounder, converted many of his assets from California to Delaware in December to derisk them from the potential wealth tax. His departure meets an end-of-2025 deadline, since the tax, if passed, would only apply to billionaires who are still residents of California on January 1, 2026.\n\nCelebrity attorney Alex Spiro wrote a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom on behalf of his wealthy clients and warned that they would \"permanently relocate\" if the California billionaire tax comes to pass.\n\nNvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "Hard-drive and storage stocks surged after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang highlighted data storage as a key AI bottleneck at CES.",
    "fullText": "The companies behind some of tech's least glamorous products — hard drives and storage — are powering a sharp rally on Wall Street.\n\nThe surge comes after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at CES 2026 on Monday that the AI boom isn't just about chips, but about where vast amounts of data live.\n\nSanDisk, the flash-memory company spun out of Western Digital last year, has been the standout. Its shares surged about 28% on Tuesday, marking their strongest intraday performance since February. The stock is already up more than 40% just days into January, making SanDisk the top performer in the S&P 500 on Tuesday.\n\nWestern Digital and Seagate Technology, two of the world's largest makers of hard-disk drives, are also seeing a boost. Western Digital's shares jumped about 17% on Tuesday, while Seagate rose about 14%.\n\nHuang described the memory storage market as a \"completely unserved market today.\"\n\n\"This market will likely be the largest storage market in the world, basically holding the working memory of the world's AIs,\" he said at CES with analysts on Monday.\n\n\"The amount of context memory, the amount of token memory that we process, KB cache we process, is now just way too high,\" he added, referring to AI storage needs.\n\nMemory prices have been rising. Korea Economic Daily reported on Monday that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are pushing for server DRAM price increases of 60% to 70% in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter.\n\nMarket analysis firm Counterpoint said last week that memory prices could rise by 40% through the second quarter of 2026, as AI-driven demand continues to strain supply.\n\nThe AI race has largely been about chips, data centers, and power. But data storage is coming into focus as a key bottleneck.\n\nDriven largely by AI workloads, the volume of stored global data was expected to top 200 zettabytes in 2025 — the equivalent of 200 billion terabytes.\n\nAnalysts have predicted that demand for data storage could run ahead of supply.\n\n\"The memory market is at an unprecedented inflexion point, with demand materially outpacing supply,\" an analyst from global market intelligence firm International Data Corporation wrote in a December note.\n\n\"For an industry that has long been characterized by boom-and-bust cycles, this time is different,\" the analyst said, citing the rapid build-out of AI infrastructure and workloads as a shift that is straining the memory ecosystem.\n\n\"For consumers and enterprises alike, this signals the end of an era of cheap, abundant memory and storage, at least in the medium term,\" the analyst added.",

So, I used to do anything and everything not to say the thing that would make the waters choppy,\" Paltrow told host Amy Poehler.\n\nOver time, the Goop founder said she realized the approach was causing more problems than it prevented.\n\n\"When you don't say what needs to be said in the moment to spare somebody else's feelings, first of all, like, you're rejecting the truest part of yourself,\" Paltrow said.\n\n\"And then it's going to come out another way. And that's like, you'll end up being dishonest. You'll end up not saying what needs to be said.

    "fullText": "Elon Musk says China is on track to outpace every other country in the computing power needed to run AI.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO said in an episode of the \"Moonshots with Peter Diamandis\" podcast published Tuesday that \"China's going to have more power than anyone else and probably will have more chips.\"\n\n\"Based on current trends, China will far exceed the rest of the world in AI compute,\" he added.\n\nMusk said China's decisive advantage in the AI race lies in its ability to scale electricity generation. He estimated that China could reach about three times the electricity output of the US by 2026, giving it the capacity to support energy-hungry AI data centers.\n\nElectricity generation is the limiting factor to scaling AI systems, Musk said.\n\n\"People are underestimating the difficulty of bringing electricity online,\" he added.\n\nWhile the US has focused on restricting China's access to advanced semiconductors, Musk suggested those constraints may matter less over time. China will \"figure out the chips,\" he said.\n\nMusk added that diminishing returns at the cutting edge of chip performance might make it easier for China to catch up, even without access to the most advanced designs.\n\nMusk has previously pointed to China as a model in areas beyond AI infrastructure.\n\nIn an episode of the \"People by WTF\" podcast published in November, Musk said he wants to turn his social media platform X into \"WeChat++,\" referencing China's dominant super app.\n\n\"I also like the idea of sort of having a unified app or website or whatever, where you can do anything you want there,\" he said. \"China has this with WeChat.\"\n\nMusk's comments come as energy supply and data infrastructure emerge as key constraints in scaling AI, rather than chips or algorithms.\n\nCompanies worldwide have rushed to build AI data centers, many of which require as much electrical power as small cities.\n\nA report from Goldman Sachs in November said that an electricity shortage could slow US progress in the AI race.\n\n\"As AI demands massive power, a reliable and ample power supply is likely to be a key factor shaping this race, especially because power infrastructure bottlenecks can be slow to solve,\" wrote Goldman's analysts.\n\nThe report added that while pressure on the US power grid is increasing, China has been steadily expanding its energy capacity.\n\n\"We expect China's spare capacity to remain sufficient to accommodate data center power demand growth while supporting demand in other industries,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nIn his annual New Year's address last week, Chinese leader Xi Jinping praised his country's progress in AI in 2025, saying China had \"integrated science and technology deeply with industries, and made a stream of new innovations.\"\n\n\"Many large AI models have been competing in a race to the top, and breakthroughs have been achieved in the research and development of our own chips,\" he said in his speech in Beijing.\n\n\"All this has turned China into one of the economies with the fastest-growing innovation capabilities,\" he added.",

    "description": "Oil prices are already under pressure due to ample supply and weak demand growth, adding strain on US shale producers.",
    "fullText": "Not all American energy companies stand to benefit from a potential revival of Venezuela's oil industry following the US's capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.\n\nEnergy stocks rose on Monday as investors priced in potential gains from renewed US access to Venezuela's massive oil reserves. But analysts say smaller companies could struggle to benefit from a recovery in the country's energy sector.\n\nAdditional Venezuelan oil supply over the coming years could be \"negative for shale producers\" that don't have a footprint in Venezuela, Daan Struyven, the head of oil research at Goldman Sachs, said on the firm's \"Exchanges\" podcast, published on Tuesday.\n\nThat's because prices and volumes could come under pressure if supply growth over the next five to 10 years comes from Venezuela rather than from US shale, he added.\n\nThe potential strain on shale reflects a key difference in oil quality. Venezuelan crude is heavy and sulfur-rich, while US shale production is dominated by lighter oil. Many US Gulf Coast refineries were originally designed to process heavier crude, making Venezuelan barrels a better fit.\n\nGreater access to Venezuelan crude could therefore benefit refiners while undermining demand for lighter shale barrels.\n\nWhile light shale oil and heavy crude like Venezuela's are not directly interchangeable, increased supplies of heavy oil can still reshape refinery demand and pricing across the broader market. That kind of change would indirectly pressure US shale producers, who have long been the engine of America's shale revolution.\n\n\"In the US, the first casualties would likely be some oil producers, particularly smaller shale firms with high debt and thin margins,\" Philippe Le Billon, a professor at the University of British Columbia who studies the political economy of natural resources, wrote in The Conversation on Sunday.\n\nFurthermore, oil prices have already been under pressure in recent years due to ample supply and sluggish demand growth.\n\nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude futures are trading around $56 a barrel, while Brent futures are around $60 a barrel. Both are down around 2% so far this year after falling 20% last year.\n\nEven an increase in Venezuela's oil production in the medium term could put downward pressure on oil prices, making it harder for higher-cost US shale producers to justify new drilling, researchers at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy said in a Sunday post.\n\nThat dynamic could intensify the pressure on US shale producers.\n\n\"This complicates the notion that the US would unambiguously 'win' from a Venezuelan oil revival. Energy geopolitics creates winners and losers on all sides,\" wrote Le Billon.",

    "title": "CES 2026: This Tiny Computer Is like a Mac Mini for PC Users",
    "description": "Lenovo's Yoga Mini i actually has a useful power button.",
    "fullText": "Mini PCs are great for people who want minimal desk setups, but aside from the Mac Mini, they're not really something that appeals to the average user. Most are boring and still-slightly-chunky boxes, come from lesser-known companies like Geekom, and are built either for enterprise or thrifty gamers. What's a Windows user who doesn't want to swap to Apple to do? This year, Lenovo's launching a new Mini PC with some of that Apple sleekness, to try to fill that niche.\n\nUnveiled at CES, the Lenovo Yoga Mini i is a cute little circle that fits in the palm of your hand and weighs just about 1.3 pounds (with small variations depending on how you configure it). A slightly textured, silvery-gray paint job covers the entirety of the device, and ports are generous but stay in dedicated areas on either the rear or side of the device. The rear's got slots for an ethernet port, a USB-A cable, an HDMI cable, and three USB-C cables, with one set aside for power, one for Thunderbolt 4 accessories, and one for all the rest. The side has a 3.5mm headphone jack (thank goodness) and another Thunderbolt 4 port.\n\nIt's an overall attractive appearance, which is important when you're selling something based on form factor, but the kicker is that the power button is actually on the side of the device. It sounds simple, but that's bound to drive people who bought the latest Mac Mini, which has its power button underneath the computer, crazy with envy. Better yet? That power button also doubles as a fingerprint reader for easy sign-ins.\n\nSpecs wise, it comes decked out with the latest Intel Core Ultra X series AI chips, up to 32GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of storage. It also features a WiFi 7 adapter, two speakers, and even a microphone built-in, for zippy internet connectivity and easy audio calls. That's more than enough performance for the average person, and probably even outclasses my years-old full-size desktop. Don't expect to play the latest games at max settings on it, but this should be roughly equivalent to a high-end productivity laptop if you go for its most powerful configuration options.\n\nTo push it over the edge, the Yoga Mini i also has its own \"one more thing.\" There's actually an accelerometer with a touch sensor inside this thing, so it can work with Lenovo's Smart Connect ecosystem. The company says you can use this to take calls by tapping on the PC, use certain touch gestures to adjust the Yoga Mini's performance mode, or use a customizable double tap to do other actions, like calling up an AI chatbot.\n\nTaken all together, the smooth appearance, user-friendly design tweaks, and tiny size make for probably the closest thing I've seen to a Windows version of the Mac Mini yet—and that goes for the pricing, too. The Yoga Mini i will start at $700, which is $100 more than the base Mac Mini, but is still pretty affordable for those kind of specs in the middle of a memory shortage. Lenovo hasn't said how expensive it could get if you go for extra storage or RAM, too, and it's possible its mid-range configurations could come in at less expensive or around the same price as the Mac Mini's.\n\nPersonally, I was seriously considering downsizing to a Mac Mini for my next computer, but with the Lenovo Yoga Mini i, maybe I'll stick to Windows for at least a little bit longer. If you're in the same boat, Lenovo expects to release the Yoga Mini i sometime this June.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Nvidia's Updated DLSS Makes Games Run Worse on Older GPUs",
    "description": "The most commonly uses Nvidia graphics cards are starting to get left in the dust.",
    "fullText": "Unless you run an AI data center, Nvidia's announcements this CES have been more on the quiet end. There were updates to GeForce Now cloud streaming and its DLSS upscaling tech, but no new graphic cards. That's fine—it's normal for Nvidia to have a quiet year on consumer tech every now and then, and the RTX 50-series GPUs just came out last year. Unfortunately, it turns out those DLSS updates are actually making games run worse on older GPUs.\n\nThe new version of DLSS, called DLSS 4.5, is pretty great when it works. It already makes lighting appear far more realistic even when ray tracing or HDR isn't being used, and in the spring, it will introduce dynamic frame generation, which can adjust how many AI frames are inserted into your game on the fly, so that it doesn't waste compute producing more frames than necessary, or than your monitor can produce. I saw examples of both of these use cases in person at CES, and as someone who mostly plays without upscaling when I can, I was impressed enough that I might want to get a new GPU and make the swap.\n\nAnd I stress that \"new GPU\" part. Unfortunately, DLSS 4.5 only seems to work best on Nvidia's newest cards. It released in beta for all Nvidia GeForce RTX cards yesterday, but gamers on older RTX 3000-series cards are already reporting issues. According to a report from X user Mostly Positive Reviews (via Tom's Hardware), users on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU could see up to a 24% dip in performance in Cyberpunk 2077, and a 14% drop in The Last of Us Part 2. Those are just a few examples, but others in the comments posted their own headaches, as did users on Reddit.\n\nThat's not a small issue. The RTX 3080 Ti might be a few generations behind, but it was near the top of the line when it was current. More importantly, according to Steam's own data, the RTX 3060 is currently the most common graphics card on Steam, and it's weaker than the RTX 3080 Ti. And technically, DLSS 4.5 is available for the even weaker RTX 2000-series, which are bound to run into even more severe problems.\n\nSo where's this massive performance loss coming from, and what can you do about it? Likely, it has to do with the new AI transformer model powering DLSS, which Nvidia said was built with RTX 40-series and RTX 50-series cards in mind. While you can use DLSS 4.5 with an older GPU, it doesn't seem like it's intended.\n\nThankfully, if you decided to try out DLSS 4.5 on an older card and you don't like what you're seeing, you're not stuck with it. Currently, public DLSS 4.5 implementation is in beta, and needs to be applied to games by choosing either the \"Model M\" or \"Model L\" preset in the Nvidia app (under \"Latest\" and \"Custom,\" respectively). Choosing another model, like Model K, should get you back to normal. When DLSS 4.5 gets a full release on January 13, I assume this will get even simpler.\n\nStill, it's not a great look that most Nvidia gamers can't use its exciting new feature. Because it can be reversed, it doesn't break anything, but it also shows that Nvidia is starting to leave all but its most loyal GPU customers behind. And as someone who mostly only uses upscaling while on weaker hardware like the Steam Deck, what I find especially weird is that upscaling is already all about using software to improve performance when you're lacking raw power. That should theoretically make gamers with weaker cards the target audience.\n\nBut it's not all doom-and-gloom for my fellow cheap gamers. Alongside DLSS 4.5, Nvidia also announced a native Linux client for Nvidia GeForce Now, alongside a native Amazon Fire TV app. That extends the cloud gaming platform to even more users, and because GeForce Now has a free tier, it's a pretty sweet deal. Play it right, say by getting a Fire TV on sale and loading up a free game, and you could game using Nvidia's latest GPUs on the big screen while spending less than $20. Sure, you might have to deal with some latency and video compression while doing it—as is the tradeoff with cloud gaming—but as DLSS 4.5 shows, even using local hardware comes with its own problems.",

    "title": "CES 2026: This Lenovo Gaming Laptop Can Stretch From 16:9 to ‘Ultrawide’ With the Push of a Button",
    "description": "It's the best of both worlds.",
    "fullText": "Choosing a gaming monitor is a tough choice. Do you want a standard, 16:9 monitor that takes up a small amount of desk space, or a larger 21:9 or even 32:9 ultrawide monitor that takes up more space, but will also show you more of your game? This goes double for laptops, where ultrawide models are few-and-far between, and are absolutely gigantic. Lenovo's new concept for CES, the Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable, aims to give you the best of both worlds.\n\nWhen the laptop is closed, or when you first open it up, the Legion Pro Rollable looks like any other gaming laptop. It's a little thick, with RGB keys and a full numpad, but otherwise isn't notable. It's also got a bog standard, 16:9 aspect ratio. But with the press of a button, it can extend to a 21:9 ultrawide screen. And while it's not quite as fancy as the 32:9 screens the most spoiled gamers use, you can actually extend it further to a 24:9 screen if you want.\n\nThat trick is possible thanks to a rollable OLED panel, something Lenovo's shown off and even released before, but for laptops that extend vertically, and aren't meant for gamers. The transformation is quick and quiet, and Windows doesn't even need time to adjust to match your new aspect ratio. It kind of feels like you're unfurling a scroll.\n\nIn total, the screen space can extend from 16-inches in 16:9 (or \"Focus\") mode to 21-inches in 21:9 (or \"Tactical\") mode to 24-inches in 24:9 (or \"Arena\" mode). Aspect ratio numbers don't always match screen space measurements that neatly, but hey, they're easy to keep track of here.\n\nHaving up to 24 inches of screen space on-the-go could be a life changer, and not just for gamers. Currently, I'm writing this article while traveling, which means I'm stuck with just my laptop screen. I'm sorely missing the second monitor I have at home, and being able to swap my screen into an ultrawide mode could easily fix that issue. Plus, I could just shrink it back down to a more standard form factor when it comes time to pack it away.\n\nThe only real catches would be weight and price. I don't have specific numbers for how heavy this is, but it didn't feel too different from any other gaming laptop in my hands. Beefy, but not back-breaking.\n\nAs for price, here's the kicker. Because this is just a concept, there's no pricing or availability info, since it's not guaranteed to come out. Lenovo does say the unit I saw is based on a top-specced Lenovo Legion Pro 7i, though, which currently goes for around $3,000.\n\nThat would be a lot to pay, especially because the extending screen would probably add a couple hundred dollars to the price tag. I wouldn't put too much stock into the demo unit right now, though—if this does make it to market, you'll probably be able to configure it to better match your needs.\n\nPersonally, though, I might be willing to pay that $3,000. Not only is this truly unique in the space, but it also conveniently solves one of my biggest pain points when I have to use my laptop, which is the lack of a two-screen setup. It could even be useful for desktop gamers looking to make the transition to portable gaming—no more having to choose which type of monitor you want.",

    "title": "This Radar-Equipped Stove Shutoff Is One of the Most Practical Things I Saw at CES",
    "description": "The iGuardStove keeps seniors safe in the kitchen by reducing the chance of cooking fires.",
    "fullText": "Radar-based sensors seem to be having a moment at CES, especially in tech meant for people to keep tabs on their aging family members. One product in particular caught my eye because it’s focused on a single important function—preventing kitchen fires caused by a person wandering away from the stove.\n\niGuardStove is essentially a smart shutoff for a stove or cooktop. Its new, radar-equipped version costs $399 and can work on gas or electric stoves. (For gas, you’ll need to have a plumber install a shutoff valve.) If you leave the kitchen while cooking, a five-minute timer starts. If you don’t return by the time it goes off, the device either cuts the power to your electric stove, or shuts off the supply line to your gas stove. It can also notify a caregiver that a shutoff event occurred.\n\nA big theme in smart tech this year is aging-in-place. Most older adults would prefer to live at home as long as they can, but health challenges can make that difficult. When it comes to cooking or other activities that require a sharp mind, mental health issues like dementia come into play, as do medications that can have cognitive side effects. With all that in mind, caregivers often worry about a parent leaving the kitchen while cooking, forgetting that the stove is on.\n\nThe National Fire Protection Association reports that cooking fires are the top cause of home fires, the top cause of fire-related injuries, and the number three cause of fire-related deaths. Unattended cooking equipment causes half of those deaths. Older adults are overrepresented as fire casualties compared to younger and middle-aged people.\n\nThe device has a five-minute timer, specifically, because that was a safety margin the company developed with safety organization UL, chief marketing officer Jon Landers told me. You can also override the five-minute timer if you’re roasting a turkey or preparing a slow-simmered sauce. In this case you tell the device how long the food is expected to cook, and it lets this cook time complete before resetting to the usual five-minute timer behavior.\n\nA previous version of the iGuardStove used motion detectors, but if you’ve ever worked in an office that had lights on motion sensors, you know why that wasn’t a great solution: sit still at a table for too long, and the lights go off. The older version of the device could potentially shut off while you're just waiting for your dinner to cook, and could be triggered by motion from pets. Radar solves those problems, since it can more accurately identify when a person is in the room.\n\nI’ve been seeing radar in a number of aging-in-place products at CES this year. The Silver Shield from PontoSense uses radar to monitor a person’s presence and movement in a room, reporting movement and potential falls to a caregiver’s app. Luna, a conversation and reminder device from Cairns Health, includes radar that can monitor heart rate and breathing (even through blankets!) when positioned near a person’s bed. The iGuardStove has some monitoring features in common with those devices, but it stays focused on its main task of ensuring stoves aren’t left running unattended.\n\nRadar can “see” a lot, but it doesn’t feel quite as privacy-invading as a camera. Having a device in the kitchen is also a bit less intrusive than in a bedroom, for those who would feel creeped out knowing that a tech device is watching them sleep.\n\nBesides shutting off the stove, the iGuardStove can report to a caregiver (via an app, of course) things like what time each day a person first enters the kitchen. It can catch nighttime wandering if the person visits the kitchen at night; it can also send an alert if the person doesn’t seem to be up and active at their usual time. For example, if your mom usually makes coffee around 9:00 every morning, you can ask the app to notify you if the kitchen is still empty at 10:00.\n\nBesides shutting off the stove and reporting on the presence of a person in the kitchen, the iGuardStove has a few other clever features. The version of the device made for gas stoves can detect unburned gas, in case somebody left it on without a burner running.\n\nThe device can also be configured to keep the stove from being turned on by pets or children, or it can be locked to not allow cooking during certain hours or days (say, at night). The app can also alert a caregiver if temperatures get too hot or cold, prompting them to check in if a heat wave or a cold snap is bad enough to affect indoor temperatures.\n\nWhile a lot of products I’ve seen at CES are speculative or hopeful in their use cases—I often find myself asking “who would actually use this?”—the iGuardStove seems thoughtfully designed and has a concrete use case and benefit. I was impressed! The new device is expected to ship later this year.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Lenovo's New 'AI Frame' Gaming Monitor Might Actually Just Be Cheating",
    "description": "Is it OK to use AI to zoom in on your reticle in a shooter?",
    "fullText": "It's easy to take this for granted, but not everyone is able to immediately look at a shooting or strategy game and find the reticle or map. Gaming UIs can get complicated, and for less-seasoned gamers, they can be pretty intimidating, too. Lenovo's new concept \"AI Frame\" monitor, shown off at CES 2026, aims to make some games a bit more approachable, although experts might consider it cheating.\n\nHardware-wise, this is a normal 21:9 ultrawide gaming monitor, but it's not actually meant to be used like that. Instead, you play your game in a left-justified 16:9 rectangle that takes up most of the screen, and in the remaining space, the AI will automatically zoom in on part of your gameplay and show a blown-up version of it. For instance, it might show you a zoomed-in map in a MOBA, so you don't have to look at the tiny mini-map in your main gameplay to know where you or your team are. Or, it might zoom in on your reticle in a shooter, letting you better see your targets. There's even enough space left over for you to pull up an internet browser and look up some help.\n\nIt worked pretty well for me in-person. Again, it doesn't actually generate any visuals, but instead just blows up the most important parts of your game screen so you can more easily glance at them or see them in more detail. That does mean resolution can suffer a little, but that's what your main gameplay screen is for. For getting across information, it's a good option.\n\nPlus, while some games will automatically know what to zoom in on, there's also a generic zoom mode that will just blow up whatever your mouse is hovering over, so it can work with any content. The AI Frame is being pitched for games, but you could also use it like a digital magnifying glass on an article in your browser, for instance.\n\nThe catch? It's maybe not exactly \"fair\" to play this way. While a bigger map in a MOBA might just save you some eyestrain, an AI-assisted zoom on a shooting reticle basically lets anyone act like a sniper, regardless of what character you're playing or gun you have equipped. For me, characters in the distance that were basically ants became immediately visible on the AI Frame, which made gunfights much easier to handle.\n\nI suppose we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. The AI Frame is just a proof-of-concept for now, so there's no hard specs sheet or pricing or release date as of yet. But if this does ever actually make it to market, Lenovo might have to contend with companies like Valve. The developer has banned similar \"this is arguably cheating\" peripherals from its games before, and the AI Frame could be the next battlefront in an ongoing war between peripheral makers (who want to sell you on the idea that buying their products can make you a better player) and developers (who, at least theoretically, want all of their players to be on an even playing field).",

    "fullText": "on January 6, 2026 at 9:24PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nIn early 2021, an unknown game called Valheim burst onto the survival games scene after exploding in player count on Steam. For many players, there's still not a game like Valheim that truly captures what it has to offer. From the architecturally sound base building to the Viking atmosphere and the different map environments teeming with new resources and bosses, there's a reason why Valheim is still considered one of the best survival games in the genre.\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean there aren't other games that share many similarities with Valheim. You can play a variety of survival titles that offer a comparable experience in at least one way. If you've been searching for a new game of Valheim's caliber, then we have you covered. We have compiled a list of the 11 best games like Valheim, which are all easily playable in 2026 and share one or more gameplay aspects with the Viking survival game.\n\nThe RuneScape franchise is most well-known in the MMO genre, as the default RuneScape and its counterpart, Old School RuneScape, are both some of the most successful MMOs on the market. However, developer Jagex took a long-awaited step outside that genre with its newest release, RuneScape: Dragonwilds. This is a survival game that has clearly taken some inspiration from Valheim, just like Valheim initially took inspiration from the RuneScape MMO. Dragonwilds features a similar aesthetic, the same kind of precise base building, and several unique skills you can level up by performing actions in the world. Dragonwilds is still unfinished, but the developer is delivering frequent updates to expand the skilling system, add to the story, and design new parts of the map. It's arguably the closest 1:1 experience of Valheim to be found.\n\nSons of the Forest is what you get when you add horror and a more brutal survival experience to Valheim. In terms of gameplay, Sons of the Forest and Valheim are fairly different; Sons of the Forest is a first-person shooter that emphasizes survivability and a more open-ended exploration path. The game begins with you crash-landing on an island filled with dangerous and mysterious creatures that all want you dead. You'll have to scavenge in deep and dark caves and other areas to find tools and weapons you need to survive on the island. A couple of companions can help you out, especially when building your base, but you're mostly on your own as you traverse the island looking for new resources. Sons of the Forest isn't for the faint of heart, as there are intense moments, jump scares, and other horror elements around every corner. However, it's another terrific survival game that shares Valheim's hard-to-master combat and multi-environment map.\n\nIf there's one thing you're taught early on in Valheim, it's to not go into the sea unless you're prepared to face what lies beneath. Well, in Raft, you don't have a choice but to head into the sea. Raft is a survival game that starts you off floating on a small wooden platform surrounded by nothing but water. Through finding resources underwater and eventually finding land formations, you can transform your raft into a luxurious boat that can stand against any threat the game has to offer. However, this doesn't mean danger isn't lurking, as you have to fend for yourself when you dive underwater to look for more supplies. If the resource-gathering and base-building elements of Valheim are what you enjoy most, then you'll find immediate satisfaction with Raft.\n\nWe're headed back to the water with this entry, and Subnautica redefines a fear of the open ocean. If you weirdly enjoyed the sea monster and its appearances in Valheim, then you'll be thrilled with what Subnautica has to offer. You're the lone survivor of a spaceship crash that winds up in the middle of an unknown planet, which is almost entirely made up of water. Your job is to explore the ocean, find other missing members of your crew, and unravel the true nature of the planet's origin and power. Subnautica features some of the best open-world exploration of any game, and its survival elements will test you for your entire playthrough. You'll have to fend off sea creatures of all shapes and sizes, and this includes some truly terrifying leviathan-sized monsters that can eat you in a second if you're not prepared. Subnautica offers a similar style of character and map progression as Valheim, as you need to explore different environments to access new resources that are required to progress to further areas. You'll also partake in fantastic base building that offers the ability to craft underwater submarines.\n\nIf you ever looked at the Valheim map and thought to yourself, \"I could create something better,\" then The Planet Crafter might just be the next game for you. This survival game allows you to completely terraform an entire planet, giving you full control over what kind of fauna, flora, and environments are found in your new home. You'll initially scavenge the planet for supplies so you can get a base set up, but then you can explore and make the planet hospitable for human life. The terraforming process includes maintaining heat, oxygen, and pressure levels, as well as deciding the terrain of a given area. The Planet Crafter doesn't offer the combat or in-depth base building of Valheim, but it does offer the same level of exploration and resource-gathering.\n\nEnshrouded is another survival game that shares plenty of aspects with Valheim. It features deep exploration and has a focus on combat, with the map holding several bosses you can fight to earn unique rewards that will aid you in advancing through other parts of the map. Enshrouded also has a substantial base-building system that allows you to make massive forts in multiple locations across the world. One thing that sets Enshrouded apart from Valheim is its RPG mechanics that offer new upgrades and abilities for your character as you level up. Enshrouded is a great survival experience that can be played solo or in co-op with up to 16 players on a single world.\n\nThe unique parts of Valheim are what make it such a fun survival game, and V Rising offers plenty of new gameplay elements that aren't seen elsewhere. For starters, the game sees you play as a vampire who's just awoken from a long hibernation period. You have to rebuild your kingdom, but to do so you need to brave the outside elements, which aren't kind to vampires. At all times, you need to avoid the sun and other light, or you'll take severe damage. This adds an entirely new layer to the general gameplay loop you see in most survival games. V Rising also has in-depth combat with varied enemies, bosses, and even some PvP if you choose to play on a multiplayer server.\n\nThe original Grounded had various Valheim influences that shone throughout its life cycle, and now the sequel is building off those influences. Grounded 2 is a step-up from the original in just about every way, featuring a more explorable map, new enemy types, and a smoother crafting system. The basic gameplay loop in Grounded 2 is very similar to its prequel, as you still play as a character that's been shrunken down to 1/4th the size of a blade of grass. As this character, you need to survive in a park that's full of different areas and environments, all of which offer resources and items that you can use to build a base and upgrade your character's gear and abilities. The exploration and differently-scaled areas of the map in Grounded 2 are very reminiscent of Valheim, and there's plenty more for fans to enjoy in this fantastic addition to the survival genre.\n\nWhen it comes to difficulty, Valheim certainly doesn't hold your hand through some of the challenging combat engagements or survival aspects. If you're looking for an increased level of difficulty compared to Valheim, though, check out Green Hell. Green Hell is a far tougher survival game that places you right in the middle of the unforgiving Amazon rainforest. You'll have to always monitor your character's vitals and watch out for the different environments that all pose a new kind of threat. In addition to the challenging environments, you'll also face off against difficult enemies who inhabit the rainforest, and they're always lurking nearby. Green Hell features some expansive base building, terrific yet arduous exploration, and a difficulty level that's not often found in a survival game.\n\nPalworld is a survival game that combines elements from Valheim and Pokémon. The game allows you to catch creatures known as Pals that all have different types, levels, locations, and attacks. With your Pals, you can either keep them in a storage system, place them in your party, or put them to work at your base. Pals are especially helpful with base building and management, as some of them have unique abilities that can be utilized to upkeep stations, harvest materials, and build new structures. If you decide to take some Pals with you in your party, you can use them to battle other Pals, including a selection of bosses. Your character can also battle Pals using weapons that are crafted with resources you find in the world. The more you progress, the higher-level resources you can access, which gives you the ability to craft better weapons, gear, and tools. It's all a seamless experience that focuses on the grind of exploring the map to find new Pals and resources. Like in Valheim, Palworld also features fairly strict survival elements, as you have to constantly manage health, hunger, and thirst.\n\nConan Exiles is one of the OG survival games that laid a foundation for many popular games in the genre that followed it. It's set in the Conan the Barbarian universe, and offers a lot of what Valheim fans have come to know and love in the Viking survival game. Conan Exiles offers an in-depth base-building system that allows players to construct a variety of unique and expansive structures. While the combat is fairly limited at the start, Conan Exiles has added sorcery and other combat mechanics over the years, allowing you to utilize plenty of different weapons to take down the enemies that are scattered across the large, open world map. One aspect of Conan Exiles that differs from Valheim is that it offers more multiplayer elements, as there's online PvP and online co-op, both of which add more replayability.",

    "fullText": "on January 6, 2026 at 9:27PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nPlenty of games have come out in the years since Unknown Worlds Entertainment released Subnautica that aim to offer a similar experience to the survival title. However, only a handful of games are truly like Subnautica enough where you get some of the same feelings while playing them as you did while roaming the open ocean of Planet 4546B for the first time. While few games can totally replicate the complete experience of Subnautica, some are great alternatives that expand upon the gameplay elements or mechanics present in the underwater adventure.\n\nToday, we'll be listing 16 games to play if you're a fan of Subnautica and looking for something else to scratch that survival/horror itch. Of course, there are other elements to Subnautica, including a robust crafting system, vast exploration, and a unique setting, and some of the entries on the list will prominently feature those aspects instead of simply being another survival game with horror elements.\n\nNaturally, we have to kick off this list with the successor to the original Subnautica. Subnautica: Below Zero is a direct sequel to the first game and takes place on the same planet, but in a completely different area. You also play as a new protagonist, a scientist who has come to the planet along with dozens of others to study its fascinating flora and fauna. Below Zero offers more of a story than the original, but your overall goal is still to explore every inch of the ocean and surface. While you'll see some familiar creatures, plants, and craftable structures, Below Zero offers new leviathans and other deadly creatures as well as brand new objects to craft at your base.\n\nOne of the biggest changes in Below Zero is more of an emphasis on land travel, and there's even a new vehicle you can craft to traverse the icy landscapes that are above the ocean. If you loved the original Subnautica, you'll love Below Zero, but we must warn you, the horror elements have been cranked up slightly in the sequel.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nThe Planet Crafter doesn't feature too many water elements like Subnautica, and it doesn't have many formidable creatures to avoid. However, it does allow you to completely terraform an entire planet from the ground up, giving you the chance to dictate every part of how the planet is designed. At the start of the game, your goal is to simply survive the harsh conditions of the planet and build a small base to start the terraforming process. Over time, though, you can begin to tone down the weather conditions and form the planet in whatever image you want. You're able to go through different stages of terraforming, which include creating sustainable resources, to even terraforming insects, plants, and animals. The world is your oyster in The Planet Crafter, and while there are survival elements present, your main job is to transform your planet into a livable environment. It's great for any Subnautica player who enjoyed the base building or perhaps wanted to change certain parts about how the ocean is laid out.\n\nWe've talked about games that take place in the water and on the surfaces of a planet, so how about we combine those settings? No Man's Sky is a game that allows you to explore an entire universe. It gives you a spaceship, some tools to gather resources, and then tells you to head out and explore a nearly infinite, procedurally-generated universe. The universe has more planets than you could ever hope to explore, and though the planets aren't all that different from one another, it's what you can accomplish on the planets that matters.\n\nRecent updates in No Man's Sky give you the chance to create an entire space station on a planet, head underwater into the depths of oceans, and even mine for prehistoric fossils that you can use to further expand your journey. When you're not spending time on a planet, you can meet other players in a central hub and customize your spaceship. It's a fantastic experience that truly never ends if you don't want it to.\n\nRaft is a natural choice for players who are hoping to find a similar experience to Subnautica. Raft is another survival game where you, or you and some friends, are stuck on a small raft in the middle of a vast ocean. Your goal is to survive and expand your raft so you can avoid the perils of the ocean and everything that calls it home, including great white sharks. Over time, you'll eventually scavenge resources to be able to build a large, wooden houseboat that houses different crafting stations to aid your survival. Eventually, you'll even be able to reach different land masses and explore those as well.\n\nWhile Raft places more of an emphasis on staying out of the water than exploring it, you still need to head underwater to secure the resources you need to build more structures on your raft. Sharks and other creatures are lurking nearby, but you're used to that feeling if you've played any Subnautica.\n\nGrounded 2 is the sequel to the hit survival game of the same name, both of which are developed by Obsidian Entertainment, the studio behind The Outer Worlds and Fallout: New Vegas. The sequel to Grounded takes much of the same gameplay design from the original, as you still play as characters that have been shrunken down to the size of a grain of sand. However, Grounded 2 features an entirely new map, fresh content to unlock, and a much more rewarding gameplay loop. You'll fight bosses, explore for new research that can be turned into gear, and build a staggering base to keep out all of those pesky insects.\n\nWe don't have to spend a lot of time on this entry. Minecraft is the game that paved the way for most modern survival games, crafting a blueprint for the genre that has been followed and altered since 2009. While there aren't too many horror elements of Minecraft that might attract leviathan-loving Subnautica fans, everything else is a survival player's dream. You have a randomly generated map that goes on far beyond what you're able to explore, hundreds of crafting resources, and the ability to build whatever kind of base your mind can dream up. If you want a different kind of Minecraft experience, you can also access thousands of mods or custom servers that completely change the gameplay.\n\nAstroneer is another survival game that allows you to terraform planets, but on a much larger scale. Instead of getting a single planet to manage, you can bounce between five different planets, changing each one the way you see fit. Each planet houses various resources for you to gather that unlock new crafting recipes that you can use to upgrade your base or increase the production of other resources. In addition to base building and terraforming, Astroneer also offers expansive exploration, with planets housing several different environments and secret locations to discover.\n\nPerhaps the most noticeable aspect of Astroneer, though, is its graphics; the visuals are extremely vibrant and feature a distinct art style that looks like everything on your screen was hand-painted. Astroneer is an experience similar to Subnautica in some ways, but it offers much \n\nStranded Deep offers an extremely similar premise to Subnautica. It starts off with you being the survivor of a plane crash and stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. You need to find a way to survive the ocean's elements and creatures before eventually finding land, which comes with its own challenges. Luckily, Stranded Deep offers a skills system that allows you to upgrade your character in various ways as you progress. This gives you the chance to unlock fresh crafting recipes to use on your base or even different vehicles that allow you to explore more areas of the map, which is procedurally generated.\n\nIn addition to the basic survival and base-building gameplay loops, Stranded Deep also offers a robust combat system. You can eventually challenge three different bosses to earn uber-important rewards. There are also a slew of other creatures you can hunt for food or sport. Stranded Deep offers perhaps the closest experience to Subnautica on this list, but it does offer \n\nForever Skies is a recent game that takes clear inspiration from the Subnautica series, but does add several of its own twists. The game is set on a post-apocalyptic Earth that has been ravaged ecologically, leaving you with very little in terms of resources to gather. Fortunately, you're able to construct a massive airship that can travel across the map so you can find new areas to explore. Your airship acts as your main base, and you can place different crafting stations and structures on board that help you survive. When you're not flying high above the clouds, you can also head underneath the various bodies of water on the map, which house important resources, but massive leviathans as well. There are also large enemies on land as well, but Forever Skies equips you with some weapons to fight off these foes. It's an interesting spin on the Subnautica style of survival games, and it's worth checking out for the airship aspect alone.\n\nIf you particularly enjoy the horror elements of Subnautica, then Sons of the Forest might be the perfect game to follow it up. However, Sons of the Forest cranks the survival and horror aspects to another level. The game begins with you and a companion named Kelvin crash-landing on a seemingly deserted island. You, along with your now deaf companion Kelvin, need to find a way to stay alive and figure out exactly where you are. As you explore the island in Sons of the Forest, you'll quickly learn you're not alone. There are monsters everywhere you turn, and the only way to survive is by venturing into dark caverns and other locations to find the tools and gear you need.\n\nJump-scares are a common sight in Sons of the Forest, but when you're not exploring the dangerous caverns of the island, you can construct a decent-sized base and craft a number of other objects. This includes weapons and even vehicles, making exploration much easier and safer. Sons of the Forest is able to match the sheer terror of Subnautica while also maintaining the same sense of exploration and harsh survival scenarios.\n\nOuter Wilds has perhaps the most compelling premise and gameplay loop out of any game on this list. It's another space exploration survival game, but instead of maintaining a persistent base and inventory of resources, you have a completely different goal than to simply survive. Instead, Outer Wilds forces you to explore several unique planets, all of which house secrets and dangerous environments. The game's twist is that you're caught in a time loop, which only gives you a set amount of time to explore before you're sent back to your original starting point. When you start over, you have to go out and explore everything again. However, every time you venture out on a new journey, you're armed with the knowledge you gained from the previous explorations. It's a totally different experience from Subnautica, but one that still matches the same sense of wonder you get from exploring Planet 4546B's ocean.\n\nValheim is widely regarded as one of the best modern survival games. Like Subnautica, Valheim has inspired a number of recent survival titles. While Valheim and Subnautica mainly share a survival aspect, both games offer extremely difficult elements that need to be constantly managed in order to stay alive. In Valheim, you play as a banished Viking who needs to prove their worth to escape banishment. Your primary task is to defeat five bosses, who are located in five different zones across the map. In order to progress to each boss, you need to fully explore every subsequent zone, unlocking the specific crafting resources each one offers. With those crafting resources, you have to make tools and weapons to defeat the zone's boss.\n\nValheim offers a randomly-generated map, architecturally-sound base building, and excellent combat that makes you think about every move you make. You can also cross oceans and encounter some large enemies along the way if you're really craving some Subnautica-like gameplay.\n\nGreen Hell is a survival game that was likely inspired by the original The Forest. However, there are Subnautica elements present that will appeal to fans. Green Hell is set in the Amazon rainforest and tasks you with simply surviving the harsh elements of South America. The game features some of the most difficult survival elements in any game on this list, as you have to contend with constant weather conditions, lethal inhabitants, and various animals that all want you dead. Fortunately, Green Hell offers expansive base-building and crafting systems, giving you the ability to construct a fortress in the jungle complete with defenses and stations to make new objects.\n\nWhile Green Hell takes place on land, its map is just as dangerous as Subnautica's ocean. You have to carefully wade into every new zone in the Amazon, or else you risk dying to a new threat.\n\nArk: Survival Evolved is one of the longer-running survival games, and it has built up quite a massive player base since its release in 2015. Ark takes place on land and in the water, where you have to contend with prehistoric dinosaurs at every turn. Most of the dinos you encounter can be tamed, but you'll be running from them or fighting them the majority of the time. When you're not taming or fighting a prehistoric creature, you spend your time exploring a huge map that houses dozens of points of interest and places to build a base. You need to scavenge for resources to unlock an arsenal of weapons that can be used to fight against dinosaurs or other players if you join a PvP server.\n\nThe bases that are possible to build in Ark, along with the amount of flora and fauna you can encounter, are truly staggering. It's one of the largest-scale survival games on the market, and can easily match the thrills of Subnautica, especially if you're a fan of the leviathans.\n\nThe Long Dark is another decade-old survival game that features some of the most realistic survival elements out of any game in the genre. It's a truly solo experience that places a massive emphasis on strategizing exactly how to survive in the Canadian wilderness. You won't encounter too many enemies to fight or people to talk to; all you have is your mind and abilities. The Long Dark forces you to carefully manage hunger, thirst, stamina, and warmth while trying to scavenge for the resources to keep yourself healthy. You're able to stumble across tools and gear that make survival easier, but you'll never truly be safe from Mother Nature.\n\nYou won't take part in any base building in The Long Dark, but you will find a true sense of exploration and the terror of failing to survive. The Long Dark features permadeath in the survival mode, meaning if you die, you're dead for good.\n\nYou can think of Breathedge as like Subnautica, but in space. Breathedge places you, a character simply known as \"The Man,\" in the center of a galaxy after your spaceship breaks down while on the way to a funeral. Don't fret, though, as you have an immortal chicken by your side and plenty of items to scavenge from the various space stations in your vicinity. You'll be able to find and drive vehicles, craft new gear, and uncover some hidden truths about the galaxy around you. While Breathedge doesn't feature the heart-pounding exploration that Subnautica does, it's still a game that's begging to be explored and offers hours of seamless gameplay.",

    "fullText": "Booed off the pitch after conceding a late winner at home against their relegation rivals and on a 10-game winless run - these are desperate times for West Ham.\n\nThe Hammers have been in the Premier League in every campaign since 2012-13, but that stretch is under threat.\n\nOn Tuesday, they let a 1-0 lead slip before losing 2-1 to fellow strugglers Nottingham Forest - a result that leaves the Hammers seven points adrift of safety with 17 games to go.\n\n\"We will look to the mirror and know the position we are in, and nobody from the squad wants to play second division next season,\" said West Ham midfielder Tomas Soucek.\n\n\"We have to show the honesty between each other. The truth of who cares and who not.\"\n\nWest Ham, who won a European trophy as recently as 2023, have had a wretched campaign, but their fans would have been hoping for some late presents with an attractive post-Christmas fixture list.\n\nHome games against Fulham, Brighton and Nottingham Forest and a trip to bottom-of-the-table Wolves were a chance for the Hammers to get themselves out of trouble.\n\nOf those 12 points available, West Ham picked up just one - and even that came after they had twice thrown away the lead before drawing 2-2 with Brighton.\n\nThey conceded a late winner against Fulham, were humiliated 3-0 by Wolves and then again managed to lose after scoring first against Forest, with Morgan Gibbs-White converting a decisive 89th-minute penalty.\n\nAt half-time, the Hammers were one point from safety - now they are cut adrift and left facing a huge battle to stay up.\n\nWith four draws and six losses, it is the first time West Ham have gone 10 Premier League games without a win since a run of 11 between December 2006 and March 2007.\n\nOnly Bournemouth with 16 have dropped more top-flight points from winning positions than the Hammers' 15, while West Ham have also failed to win any of their past five matches when scoring first.\n\nBoss Nuno Espirito Santo, who guided Nottingham Forest to Europe last season before being dismissed three games into 2025-26, has now picked up 11 points from 16 matches since he replaced the sacked Graham Potter in September.\n\nThat is the worst start from any West Ham boss in the Premier League era, with the back-to-back wins over Newcastle and Burnley in November - Nuno's only two successes - quickly fading from memory.\n\nFormer West Ham and England goalkeeper Rob Green, speaking on Sky Sports, feels change is needed at London Stadium.\n\n\"Ten games without a win you're wondering, where is the answer now? Where do West Ham go now? Where does Nuno go from here? You can't see things continuing much longer with results like this,\" said Green.\n\n\"They need at least 30 points to have any chance of staying up and they're not going to get close at this rate.\n\n\"I don't see Nuno staying. I just can't see it how you can go this long without winning a game. Tonight wasn't the worst performance by a long shot and they still didn't get a result.\n\n\"It's heartbreaking but I don't see another answer. It's looking more and more an impossible task.\"\n\nWest Ham, with just 14 points all season, have London derbies at Tottenham and Chelsea either side of a tough game at home against Sunderland coming up.\n\nNuno, who handed a debut to Argentina striker Valentin 'Taty' Castellanos and brought on another January signing in Brazilian forward Pablo Felipe, remained defiant.\n\n\"It's not over yet. We keep on going,\" he said. \"We need to keep believing and sticking together.\n\n\"We have to keep going, keep believing and keep working. It is not over. Sometimes you have good moments and bad moments but you need to be resilient enough to understand this is the game.\n\n\"We understand the fans' frustration and the sadness - we are all the same.\"\n\nSoucek insisted Nuno still had the players' backing and added: \"We have to be behind the manager always, until the end.\n\n\"He can be a big help for us because he did a lot through the Premier League already.\n\n\"Especially for him I want to keep going and do the maximum, we don't want them to lose their jobs. All of us, even for the fans, we need to stick together.\"\n\nNuno Espírito Santo's position as West Ham head coach is heavily under the microscope.\n\nSupporters and pundits have already written off the Portuguese's chances of keeping the club in the Premier League. But the real question to ask is: what do the owners think of the job Nuno is doing?\n\nWell, there is certainly disappointment at the results which have left them rooted in the bottom three.\n\nThere is similar sentiment towards the performance of the team and thus the manager.\n\nBut the club's hierarchy are desperate to make Nuno's appointment a success.\n\nThey are actively backing him in the transfer market. The signings of Pablo Felipe and Taty Castellanos were both players selected by Nuno.\n\nSo to pull the rug from under him, having made signings on the manager's recommendation, would seem nonsensical. But the threat of relegation can radically change the direction of travel.\n\nWest Ham are seven points adrift from safety. That scenario will really test the board's backing of their under-pressure boss.\n\nPremier League: Gibbs-White scores late Forest winner at West Ham\n\nLatest West Ham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about West Ham - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "No. 9 BYU hosts rebuilt Arizona State on Wednesday at the Marriott Center before first matchup with rival Utah on Saturday in Salt Lake City.",
    "fullText": "One of the best things about playing basketball in the Big 12 is that there is no such thing as a trap game, even when a matchup with your fiercest rival is on the horizon.\n\nThat has been BYU coach Kevin Young’s message to his team this week as it prepares for a Wednesday night showdown (7 p.m. MST, Peacock), its Big 12 home opener, at the Marriott Center with reimagined Arizona State (0-1, 9-5), a team that features three explosive scorers and a savvy, experienced and fiery coach, Bobby Hurley.\n\nBYU (1-0, 13-1) finishes the week playing at rival Utah (0-1, 8-6) on Saturday, but Young said there will be no looking ahead. The Sun Devils have too much talent to overlook, and they were one of the better 3-point shooting teams in the country until their last three games, losses at UCLA and at home to Oregon State and Colorado.\n\nUtah (0-1, 8-6) will play at Colorado on Wednesday night before hosting BYU in the Huntsman Center on Saturday night in what will be the first coaching meeting of Young and Alex Jensen, who also came to the college ranks from the NBA.\n\n“To be honest, I haven’t even thought about Utah,” Young said Tuesday afternoon. “We’re extremely locked in on Arizona State and trying to make sure we are dialed in for them. They are a good team, much better than they were last year.”\n\nThe Cougars swept the Sun Devils last year, winning 76-56 in Provo and 91-81 in Tempe.\n\nYoung said Arizona State is “totally different” than it was last year, with sophomore guard Trevor Best the only holdover from a squad that went 4-16 in league play and 13-20 overall. Another familiar face on the ASU roster is 6-foot-8 redshirt sophomore Marcus Adams Jr., who played sparingly for BYU in 2023-24 before Young arrived in Provo. He’s averaging 3.6 points and 2.4 rebounds off the bench.\n\nPacific/Pepperdine transfer Maurice “Moe” Odum leads them in scoring with a 16.6 average, while NAIA University of the Cumberlands transfer Anthony “Pig” Johnson chips in 14.1 points per game and 7-foot-1 freshman Massamba Diop of Senegal averages 13.6 per outing.\n\nArizona State’s best wins were over Texas and Washington State at the Maui Invitational and over Oklahoma and Santa Clara in December.\n\n“They are talented. They did a good job finding good players. I am really impressed with several of their guys,” Young said. “They are obviously super long, starting 6-10, 6-11, 7-1 (players) inside. And then the guard, Moe Odum, he’s as dynamic of a guard as we’ve seen to date.”\n\nDefense and 3-point shooting has abandoned Hurley’s bunch in the three-game skid. They are shooting 19.2% from beyond the arc during that stretch, after shooting 45.3% from deep in the three games before that, against lesser competition.\n\n“We are in a tailspin right now from behind the 3-point line, and we have made a lot of those shots,” Hurley said after the Colorado loss. “… We have to solve our rebounding, and we have to solve our interior defense.”\n\nMeanwhile, BYU enters its first home game since Dec. 22 as one of the hottest teams in the country, and unbeaten in Big 12 play after its 83-73 win at Kansas State last Saturday. The Cougars have won 10-straight games for the first time since the 2010-11 season (when they did that twice) and have won nine-straight Big 12 regular-season games dating back to last year.\n\nStar wing AJ Dybantsa leads the country in scoring (23.1 ppg.) and sophomore guard Rob Wright III, a transfer from Baylor, has been “unbelievable as well,” Young said.\n\n“Rob’s experience in our league is also something that I think I’ve not only relied on, but will rely on even more as we move forward in conference play,” Young said.\n\nThe Cougars last won nine-straight regular-season conference games in 2020, when they were in the West Coast Conference.\n\n“We are fairly happy with where we are at,” said senior wing Richie Saunders after he, Dybantsa and Wright combined to score 52 points against KSU. “There are so many things we are still growing at, still getting better at. I feel good about where we are at, but we still need to grow more. … We want to peak at or near the end of conference play. But I like where we are currently at.”",

    "description": "Jackson's greatness didn't lead to late-game rallies or playoff win streaks. John Harbaugh was judged on that. His successor will be, too.",
    "fullText": "John Harbaugh was a very good and occasionally great NFL head coach. But with Lamar Jackson in tow, he trended squarely toward the former.\n\nAfter missing the playoffs in 2025 and with a 3-5 postseason record with the two-time MVP in tow, the Baltimore Ravens decided they'd seen enough. Harbaugh made it past Black Monday. He didn't last beyond Tuesday; the Ravens fired him two days after Baltimore's season ended with a missed 44-yard field goal in Pittsburgh.\n\n2025 was a perfect storm for the Ravens, who managed to stave off postseason elimination until the very last second of the regular season anyway. The defense fell apart under former rising star coordinator Zach Orr. An undermanned receiving corps was effectively a one-man show. And, most importantly, Lamar Jackson didn't look anything like the best version of himself.\n\nInjuries played a part. Jackson was, per usual, as banged up as you'd expect a running quarterback to be. He missed four starts due to injury and left two other games with hamstring and back injuries. But when he did play, he was a fraction of the quarterback he once was in every facet of the game.\n\nHis passing output dropped from 245 yards per game to 196. His sack rate exploded from 4.6 percent to 10.6. Negative plays compounded while explosive ones dwindled. His expected points added (EPA) per dropback fell from 0.29 in last year's first-team All-Pro campaign (best in the NFL) to -0.04 (22nd, just behind a 42-year-old Aaron Rodgers). His average target distance, deep ball and tight window rates all remained roughly the same but the delivery changed, leading to a significant dropoff. His 72.4 percent on-target throw rate was the lowest of his career.\n\nTJ WATT PICKS OFF LAMAR ON THE DEFLECTED PASS.\n\nBALvsPIT on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/ViXTN12C7G\n\nThat threatened to make him the run-to-paper-over-bad-throws quarterback detractors falsely accused him of being early in his career. Instead, his ground game shrank in lock step with his aerial regression.\n\nJackson went from 8.2 rushing attempts per game in 2024 -- then a career-low -- to 5.2, running less often than nine other NFL quarterbacks including Justin Fields and Jaxson Dart. His success rate, measured by how often a play gains at least 40 percent of yards required on first down, 60 percent of yards required on second down, and 100 percent on third or fourth down, ranked first in the NFL at 64.3 percent in 2022.\n\nIn 2024, it hit 56.1 to rank fifth among all qualified runners and second only to Jayden Daniels among quarterbacks. In 2025, his 5.2 yards per carry came with a career-low 47.8 percent success rate. That's the first time it's dipped below 50 percent and good for 48th place among all players and seventh among QBs.\n\nThere is hope this was all injury related and a rebound is near. But cracks began to show even before injury turned the offense over to Cooper Rush (horrible) and Tyler Huntley (mostly fine). He dazzled through the air in Weeks 1 through 4 and still went 1-3 in those games. He was sacked 15 times in those games, including seven times by the Detroit Lions -- something that's only ever happened once before in 116 regular season starts. He ran the ball fewer than four times per game. While he was efficient through the air, it was in a way that didn't swing games.\n\nThat leads us back to a problem that's persisted throughout his career. Jackson traditionally tends to come up short in close battles. He has 13 career game-winning drives in 115 regular season and postseason starts. He had five such drives in 62 games since 2022. Bo Nix, on the other hand, had seven game-winning drives in 2025 alone. Caleb Williams had six.\n\nBack in Week 1, he couldn't sustain the late drives to keep the Buffalo Bills from coming back from a 40-25 deficit in the final four minutes (obviously Baltimore's deficient defense deserves some blame as well). Early fourth quarter stall-outs kept him from delivering a home win against Detroit in Week 3.\n\nWeek 18 saw him dazzle late to keep the Ravens punching in a sloppy heavyweight de facto playoff game in Pittsburgh.\n\nLAMAR. ZAY. WOW.\n\nRAVENS TAKE THE LEAD.\n\nBALvsPIT on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/RLFrGLddRj\n\nWhile Tyler Loop's missed kick wasn't his fault, the previous loss to the Steelers -- 27-22 after Jackson led four different fourth quarter drives into Steeler territory at home and came away with exactly two field goals and nothing else -- kinda is.\n\nThat was Harbaugh's problem with Jackson. He couldn't turn his quarterback's dazzling heroics into the wins that mattered. Baltimore is 76-31 with its star quarterback at the helm in the regular season. It's 3-5 in the playoffs with a single trip beyond the Divisional Round, zero postseason win streaks and zero Super Bowl appearances to show for it.\n\nJackson's passer rating drops from an NFL-best (ever!) 102.2 in the regular season to 84.6. His sack rate goes from 7.3 to 10.4. Even though he improves a bit as a runner in January, it's not enough to cover his failings.\n\nThe Ravens took all this in. They decided good was, in fact, the enemy of great. They opted to venture into the unknown rather than head back to the playoffs with a sinking feeling of failure enveloping them.\n\nRestoring Jackson isn't the only pressing issue Baltimore's new coach will face. The defensive identity of one of the league's hardest-hitting teams has been cracked and needs to be rebuilt. Derrick Henry is 31 years old and can only keep this up for another one, two decades tops.\n\nBut ultimately, Harbaugh's replacement will be judged on his ability to turn Jackson into something more than a regular season award magnet. Improvement may be easy to come by once the dynamic quarterback is healthy again. It won't mean anything until he starts stringing together comeback wins or rallying Baltimore to multiple playoff victories.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Whomever replaces John Harbaugh as Ravens coach has to fix Lamar Jackson",

    "fullText": "USC has beefed up its defensive line room once again, landing Penn State defensive end transfer Zuriah Fisher out of the NCAA Transfer Portal.\n\nFisher, a fifth-year redshirt senior, appeared in 11 games this season for the Nittany Lions and had his best statistical season yet. The 6-foot-3, 265-pounder totaled 19 tackles, 3.5 TFLs and a pair of sacks while also forcing a fumble.\n\n“I think internally within our program, I think there is a lot of confidence that Fish has got a chance to have a big year,” former head coach James Franklin said of Fisher prior to this season. “He’s like one of those guys that I don’t think anybody’s talking about right now, outside of the program, based on just not seeing him recently, but there’s a lot of excitement internally, with our players, with our staff. I think those things are really apparent.”\n\nThat came after sitting out the 2024 campaign due to injury, giving him a medical redshirt that season. In 2023, Fisher played in all 13 of the team’s games, notching 16 tackles, 3.5 tackles for loss and three sacks. Prior to that, he appeared in 10 games over his first three seasons with PSU.\n\nA member of the Class of 2020, he is expected to have one year of eligibility remaining with the Trojans. As a high schooler, Fisher was a four-star prospect and tabbed as the nation’s No. 320 overall recruit and No. 20 EDGE in his class.\n\nNow, after finishing his sixth year at the college level this fall, he’ll look for a breakout opportunity in Los Angeles. The Trojans are expected to bring back their top three pass rushers in underclassmen Kameryn Crawford, Jide Abasiri and Braylan Shelby.\n\nThe young trio totaled 13.5 sacks last season, and USC also brings in one of the nation’s premier defensive end recruits in five-star Luke Wafle. With so much young talent, a veteran presence like Fisher could elevate the Trojans into one of the best pass-rushing groups in the country next year.",

    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks are looking like victims of their own success. While the players are getting an extra week of rest due to the No. 1 seed, their coaches are busier than ever... even with non-Seahawks related matters. Offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak is already getting plenty of requests from teams around the league to be their head coach, such as the Atlanta Falcons, but he isn't the only Seahawks coach drawing interest.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, NFL insider Ian Rapoport broke the news the Cleveland Browns have officially requested to interview Seahawks defensive coordinator Aden Durde for their open head coach position. Although head coach Mike Macdonald is the one who calls the plays on defense, Seattle's success on that side of the ball can certainly be attributed to help from Durde as well.\n\nThe #Browns have requested permission to interview #Seahawks DC Aden Durde for their vacant HC job, source said.\n\nThe native of England came to the NFL as a #Cowboys coaching intern and has risen quickly.\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 6, 2026\n\nDurde has been the Seahawks' defensive coordinator for the last two seasons. Personally, I had some hope with Macdonald being the one who calls the plays, Durde might've remained a well-kept secret in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nNFL organizations cannot deny a coach from interviewing for a position that is an upgrade, so if Durde is interested in throwing his hat in the ring with the Browns, it will be up to him.\n\nAs for Kubiak, several other teams in the league have joined the Falcons in asking permission to interview him for their vacant head coaching spots. However, according to Albert Breer, Kubiak is still figuring out what to do with the requests.\n\nSeahawks OC Klint Kubiak has gotten requests to interview for the Giants, Cardinals, Raiders and Falcons head coaching jobs, per source. His focus is on the playoffs, so he'll take a day or two and figure out a plan to balance all of it.\n\nSeattle is on a bye as the NFC's 1 seed.\n\n— Albert Breer (@AlbertBreer) January 6, 2026\n\nBoth of Seattle's coordinators getting interview requests is a challenge the Seahawks will have to navigate during the bye week. Teams can often lose focus during this time if they are not careful, which often results in catastrophic losses. Seattle needs to find a way to balance everything, as Breer mentioned in the tweet above, in order to maximize this rare opportunity for a potential Super Bowl run.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Cleveland Browns request to interview Seattle Seahawks DC Aden Durde",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots went to battle last Sunday with a limited wide receiver room.\n\nVeteran pass catcher Mack Hollins missed his second consecutive game. Hollins went on the injured reserve after an injury suffered in Week 16. He will be on the sideline until at least the AFC Conference Championship Game.\n\nUndrafted rookie receiver Efton Chism III played in 44% of the offense’s snaps against the Miami Dolphins, just one week after logging a career-high 41 snaps played in the blowout win over the New York Jets.\n\nChism was the team’s sixth receiver all season, but has had to step up in Hollins’ absence.\n\nAs such, there is room for one more receiver on New England’s practice squad as a post-season insurance policy.\n\nThe Patriots hosted two free-agent wide receivers on Tuesday to potentially fill this vacancy, ESPN’s Mike Reiss reported on X.\n\nThe first was former Division II standout Cole Burgess. Burgess recorded 3,133 yards in his four-year career for the Cortland Red Dragons. He tallied 87 receptions for 1,375 yards and 16 touchdowns as a senior. He has spent the last two seasons on the Cincinnati Bengals’ practice squad.\n\nThe other receiver is the New York Jets undrafted free agent rookie signing Dymere Miller. Miller was a practice squad player for the Patriots’ AFC East rival, and he, too, took a unique route to the NFL.\n\nHe began his college career playing for FCS Monmouth in New Jersey. In his third year at Monmouth, he was a Walter Payton Award finalist (the FCS version of the Heisman Trophy). In that historic season, he set school records for single-season receptions with 90, single-season receiving yards with 1,293 and a single-game record when he recorded 333 receiving yards in a loss to UNH.\n\nMiller then transferred to Rutgers, where he played a more than respectable senior season that earned him a spot on an NFL roster.\n\nNo signings have been made, but the Patriots have remained diligent in pursuing potential roster-strengthening opportunities.\n\nPatriots Rumors: Assistant To Interview For Head Coaching Vacancy",

    "fullText": "Yuki Kawamura's path to playing time after signing with Bulls originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Chicago Bulls made a roster move Tuesday, bringing back fan favorite Yuki Kawamura on a two-way deal.\n\nAfter an impressive run in the 2025 NBA Summer League with Chicago, it seemed certain that Kawamura would compete for minutes deep into the rotation. In five Summer League games, Kawamura averaged 10.2 points, 6.2 assists, 2.4 rebounds and 2.2 steals while showcasing impressive vision in 23.9 minutes per game.\n\nThat said, it never worked out that way, as Chicago's roster was stacked with guards like Josh Giddey, Coby White, Kevin Huerter, Tre Jones and Jevon Carter.\n\nAs a result, the Bulls waived Kawamura prior to the season.\n\nHowever, they've brought him back now, waiving Trentyn Flowers to complete the move.\n\nThis will give Kawamura his first opportunity of the season to earn NBA minutes. Last year with the Memphis Grizzlies, Kawamura only appeared in 22 games, averaging 4.2 minutes per contest. In limited action he averaged 1.6 points and 0.9 assists. In the G-League for Memphis, Kawamura averaged a double-double with 13.7 points and 10.7 assists per game.\n\nAlthough, he could earn an opportunity sooner rather than later as Giddey remains sidelined with a hamstring injury. Additionally, White has been listed as questionable for Chicago's next matchup against Detroit.\n\nKawamura will have his first chance to suit up against the Pistons Wednesday and again Thursday versus the Miami Heat on the second night of a back-to-back.\n\nVJ Edgecombe reaches stats unseen by a rookie since LeBron in 2003\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander praises Chet Holmgren for OKC's success\n\nLeBron James breaks another scoring record in win over Grizzlies\n\nTyrese Maxey: 'Joel Embiid was really the first person to believe in me'\n\nOne of the NBA's most efficient players is on a two-way contract\n\nCam Thomas' most recent dispute with Brooklyn ignites trade rumors\n\nMiami reveals the status of Tyler Herro, Bam Adebyao and more ahead of Saturday's game\n\nGuerschon Yabusele addresses his future with the Knicks following trade rumors",

Assuming he returns to full health, there is no reason to think that team could not return to form in 2026.\"\n\nMore:Todd Bowles gives outstanding response over Buccaneers future\n\nThey can. But one thing must be done for that to happen.\n\nThe franchise has to get on top of its crippling injuries.\n\nIn the back-to-back seasons, the Buccaneers suffered mightily with injuries. In 2024, they were lucky enough to overcome it. In 2025? Not so much.\n\nThe offense has enough key pieces for the Buccaneers to bounce back with ease. But the defense for most is where the problems are, and that's Bowles' department.\n\nWe have seen the Baltimore Ravens move on from John Harbaugh, and for some Bucs fans, Bowles should follow suit.\n\nBut the key to a 2026 revival lies with Baker and this star-studded offense.\n\nBuccaneers get what they deserve after Week 18 disaster\n\nBuccaneers 'break that spell' in Week 18, but too little, too late?\n\nNo Week 18 pity party for Buccaneers' Todd Bowles\n\nWhy Buccaneers' 'main focus' is an odd aspect of Week 18",

    "fullText": "Kansas last signed a blue-chip quarterback prospect in the 2011 cycle when four-star Brock Berglund landed in Lawrence — albeit for a short period of time.\n\nCould the Jayhawks land a top QB in the 2027 cycle? That remains to be seen, but they are a top contender for Temecula (Calif.) Chaparral four-star Dane Weber.\n\nThe 6-foot signal-caller made multiple trips to Lawrence in 2025. He’s gotten familiar with the KU staff, and on Monday, he was visited by offensive analyst Eric Terrazas:\n\nAppreciate your time and effort @CoachTraz \n\nAmazing home Visit!!! @KU_Football@Kotelnicki @KUCoachZ @CoachLeipold #ROCKCHALK pic.twitter.com/Am9v9krdT6\n\n— Dane Weber (@DaneWeber08) January 5, 2026\n\nWhen speaking with Rivals’ Greg Biggins around New Year’s Day, Weber tabbed Kansas as one of two schools pushing the hardest entering 2026. The Jayhawks have clearly made Weber a priority and he’s feeling the love.\n\nCincinnati, Colorado and Washington have all made their presence felt in Weber’s recruitment to this point, too. There’s other programs that he expects to come and see him throw ahead of the busy spring period, including Oregon and Auburn.\n\n“It will be good to connect with those coaches and see where I’m at on their boards,” Weber told Biggins. “The transfer portal is opening up and I’m interested to see where everyone ends up. By end of January, I want to cut it down and then set up trips. The plan will be to take my visits and then make my decision in late Spring.”\n\nWeber is the No. 357 overall prospect and No. 25 QB in the 2027 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all major recruiting media companies. He’s also the No. 35 recruit in California.\n\nBiggins writes this of Weber, who put together a nice campaign in 2025:\n\n“Weber had a big junior season and is one of the nation’s true dual-threat quarterbacks. He’s a pocket guy who can carve up a defense and threw for 3,645 yards and 41 touchdowns while completing 70% of his throws. He can take off and run at any time and rushed for 688 yards and 14 touchdowns on the ground and is the type of signal caller who can stress a defense with his arm and his legs.”\n\nKU is currently without a commitment in its 2027 class. Last month, it inked 17 prospects, compiling the No. 54 class in the nation, according to the Rivals Industry Team Recruiting Rankings.\n\nHead coach Lance Leipold and Co. did sign a QB as Maize (Kan.) Northwest three-star Jaylen Mason opted to stay home. He’s now Rivals’ No. 49 QB and No. 6 recruit in the Sunflower State.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Chicago Bulls have been dealing with a plethora of injuries since the start of the 2025-2026 campaign. Josh Giddey will be out due to a hamstring injury for two weeks. Zach Collins is out with a sprained right toe, but is expected to return on January 10th. Jalen Smith is out with a concussion, while Matas Buzelis is down with an illness, despite both being listed as day-to-day.\n\nCoby White joined the fray after reinjuring his right calf during his game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on December 29th. He would miss the next three games against the New Orleans Pelicans, Orlando Magic, and Charlotte Hornets. He would return to play against the Boston Celtics, but came off the bench while being placed on a 25-minute restriction.\n\nAlthough he had an off-night, scoring just 5 points while going 2-7 from the field and 1-5 from the three-point line, it’s clear the Bulls are taking precautionary measures to slowly ease White into the rotation. With Josh Giddey out, the team will depend on White to carry out his offensive responsibilities along with veteran Nikola Vucevic. However, it’s only possible if White remains healthy as he finally gets over the stagnant calf injury that sidelined him for most of the season.\n\nMORE:Bulls sign 5-foot-7 fan-favorite guard, cut ties with second-year wing\n\nWith this in mind, White is questionable for his matchup on Wednesday against the Detroit Pistons. This is the first game of a back-to-back before the Bulls would go on to play the Miami Heat on Thursday for the second night.

    "fullText": "Football is theatre. For someone who has chosen journalism as a career, it's easy to appreciate a good story. One of the most important of Tuesday's news cycle involves a former Philadelphia Eagles assistant. John Harbaugh has been fired. He leaves the Baltimore Ravens after leading them for nearly two decades.\n\nAround these parts, we've been busy talking about the Birds in Philadelphia, but The Flock in Baltimore has been equally fascinating. Their story involves a 30th-anniversary campaign, disappointment, and ultimately a loss in the NFL's final regular-season game. That eliminates them from postseason contention.\n\nHarbaugh has been on the hot seat all season and is now unemployed, but he won't be for long. ESPN's top NFL insider Adam Schefter reports that at least seven teams have inquired about his services. That includes one team that hasn't fired its head coach yet.\n\nWhat does this have to do with the NFC East, you ask? We appreciate the question. Lines are being drawn connecting the dots representing John Harbaugh and the New York Giants. Schefter released his report on that also.\n\nSources: John Harbaugh is expected to emerge as a favorite for the head coaching job of the New York Giants.\n\nHarbaugh will be in demand for many teams, not just the Giants.\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 6, 2026\n\nJohn Harbaugh comes from Andy Reid's coaching tree. He spent ten seasons as the Eagles' special teams coordinator and defensive backs coach. It's sad that his tenure in Baltimore ends partially because of a special teams miscue.\n\nAfter having spent so much time here, it isn't shocking to find an Eagles fan who still loves him. That all goes out of the window however if he lands in Gotham as the leader of the hated Giants.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: John Harbaugh is the favorite for the New York Giants job",

His running has remained dangerous, but he's also improved his accuracy and game processing in such a way that makes him an all-around threat.\n\nGiven that it's not often that new, exciting QBs spring out of nowhere, Willis will be tempting for a lot of teams to try. It feels like he's got untapped upside.\n\nAnd with QB-needy teams around the league, someone is going to pay Willis. At this point, it's not even a matter of how much, because a payday is coming.

    "fullText": "Which team suits Jeremiyah Love in this years upcoming NFL draft originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAs the 2026 NFL Draft approaches, one name rising quickly on scouts’ boards is Notre Dame’s dynamic running back, Jeremiyah Love. Considered a top prospect and projected as a potential first-round pick, Love is generating significant buzz due to his rare combination of size, speed, and versatility. Mock drafts frequently link him to teams like the New Orleans Saints, Kansas City Chiefs, and Minnesota Vikings, with other franchises such as the New York Giants, Jets, and Arizona Cardinals also reportedly interested.\n\nStanding out at 6-foot-1 and around 220 pounds, Love combines downhill power running with breakaway speed, making him a threat between the tackles and in the open field. His 2025 season was remarkable; he set Notre Dame’s single-season touchdown record, proving his ability to find the end zone with consistency.\n\nBut Love isn’t just a runner. He’s a polished receiver out of the backfield, frequently lining up as a wide option and showing great hands and route-running ability. This dual-threat skill set is essential in today’s NFL, where running backs must impact the passing game as much as the ground game. Love’s willingness and ability as a pass protector further increase his value, showing he can handle the complexities of NFL blocking schemes.\n\nOne of the teams most commonly associated with Love in mock drafts is the New Orleans Saints. The Saints have a strong quarterback in place and a talented receiving corps, including Chris Olave, but lack a true star running back. Love would bring a new dimension to their offense with his downhill running style and receiving skills. The Saints also need to bolster their offensive line, but Love’s versatility would allow them to maximize their existing weapons.\n\nSimilarly, the Kansas City Chiefs could be an ideal landing spot. Pairing Love with Patrick Mahomes would provide a dynamic, multi-dimensional offensive threat capable of creating mismatches against defenses. The Minnesota Vikings, looking to rejuvenate their backfield, also make sense given Love’s potential to be a long-term solution in their offense.\n\nThe debate about drafting running backs in the first round remains lively. While some analysts are cautious due to the importance of offensive line play, recent first-round backs like Bijan Robinson and Jahmyr Gibbs have proven how impactful the position can be with the right supporting cast. Saquon Barkley, another top-10 running back pick, demonstrated his full potential only after moving to Philadelphia, highlighting how situational fit is crucial.\n\nLove fits the mold of a first-round back who can immediately influence a team’s offensive identity. His combination of power, speed, and receiving ability offers a unique weapon that can change the way defenses prepare.\n\nUltimately, Jeremiyah Love is more than just a running back; he is a multi-faceted offensive weapon ready to make an immediate impact in the NFL. While some teams may hesitate to use a first-round pick on a running back due to positional value debates, Love’s talent and fit with teams in need could see him selected in the top 15 or even top 10.\n\nIf the Saints or Chiefs decide to prioritize offense in the early rounds, Love’s name will be among the first called a player who can bring explosiveness and versatility to an NFL offense hungry for game-changers. His draft stock continues to rise, and many believe he could redefine the value of the running back position in 2026.\n\nOregon's Dan Lanning rips College Football Playoff, calls for major changes\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nTop 2026 NFL Draft prospect suffers broken rib in CFP quarterfinal loss\n\nESPN's grade for LSU hiring Lane Kiffin will make Ole Miss fans even more mad\n\nDabo Swinney fires Clemson coaches immediately after loss to Penn State\n\nOhio State's Ryan Day faces backlash after Cotton Bowl",

    "fullText": "The Wolverines received more good news, as offensive lineman Jake Guarnera has taken his name out of the transfer portal and is returning to Michigan for the 2026 season.\n\n— Jake Guarnera (@GuarneraJake) January 7, 2026\n\nGuarnera is the second player to withdraw from the portal for the Wolverines on Tuesday, as it was reported earlier in the day that cornerback Zeke Berry would also be returning to Michigan.\n\nGuarnera was a mainstay on the Wolverines’ offensive line from Week 3 onward this past season. He made his first career start against Central Michigan at right guard following an injury to initial starter Brady Norton, and Guarnera started at that spot the rest of the year.\n\nHe was the highest-graded Michigan offensive lineman on Pro Football Focus (69.5 overall grade) in 2025 and is now expected to have a major role for Kyle Whittingham’s first squad in Ann Arbor.\n\nThe interesting part about Guarnera hopping in the portal in the first place is that he told reporters down in Orlando during the week of the Citrus Bowl that he intended to stay with the program, but then entered the portal just a few days later anyways.\n\nRegardless of the exact circumstances that led him to the portal, it’s good to have him officially back in the mix for the 2026 season.

The question for Harbaugh is whether to take a job now or to wait a year, monitoring all developments for the best opportunity in 2027.\n\nFew think Harbaugh won't continue to coach.

    "fullText": "Ohio State wide receiver Quincy Porter plans to enter the NCAA transfer portal, according to On3’s Hayes Fawcett. Porter wound up spending just one season with the program after being a big-time recruit. He will soon be on the open market and presumably have a ton of suitors waiting on the other end.\n\nPorter played high school football at Oradell (NJ) Bergen Catholic, where he was a five-star prospect. He was the No. 22 overall recruit in the 2025 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies.\n\nOnly two wide receivers were ranked ahead of Porter. Oregon‘s Dakorien Moore was one of them, followed by Kaliq Lockett of the Texas Longhorns.\n\nRivals was higher on Porter than the rest of the industry. He came in as the No. 13 overall prospect in the Rivals300. Only one other service ranked him as a five-star. Expectations for what Porter can become certainly are high.\n\nFew in the college game are better than Brian Hartline at recruiting wide receivers. Hartline got Porter into the mix back in June 2024, holding onto the verbal all the way through National Signing Day. Schools such as Alabama, Michigan, and Penn State were considered other contenders at the time.\n\nHartline is no longer in Columbus, though, after leaving to become USF‘s next head coach. Ohio State did hire Cortez Hankton to replace him as the wide receivers coach. But Porter is still going to at least entertain the idea of continuing his playing days elsewhere.\n\nAs for his on-field production, Porter played in four games this season. Only four catches came his way for a total of 59 yards. Wide receiver is a loaded position at Ohio State, making playing time hard to come by, even for somebody as talented as Porter.\n\nLooking at the future, four years of eligibilty should remain. Porter only playing in four games means a redshirt can be taken by him.\n\nOhio State just saw its season end on New Year’s Eve in the Cotton Bowl. Miami was on the right side of a College Football Playoff quarterfinal, taking down the reigning national champions. Day and the entire Buckeyes staff now work toward building a roster capable of getting back to the top in 2026.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire. The On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.",

Minchey committed to Nebraska on Jan. 4 before changing his mind Jan. 5.\n\nColandrea was the Mountain West Player of the Year in 2025 after passing for 3,459 yards with 23 touchdowns to nine interceptions, also rushing for 649 yards and 10 scores. He was a two-year starter at Virginia before transferring to UNLV, where he starred for first-year coach Dan Mullen.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Day after committing to Nebraska, Notre Dame QB Kenny Minchey signs with Kentucky\n\nThe 6-foot signal caller is the No. 175-ranked player and No. 21 quarterback, according to 247Sports' transfer portal ratings. He's listed as a three-star recruit, per the recruiting service, and also took a visit to Florida State. Minchey was listed as a four-star recruit and No. 12 quarterback.\n\nColandrea is tasked with replacing two-year starter Dylan Raiola, who entered the transfer portal after suffering a season-ending injury. Raiola, a former five-star recruit, is still uncommitted.\n\nNebraska finished 7-6 in 2025 despite entering the season with lofty expectations. Raiola's injury didn't help, of course, leaving the program with true freshman TJ Lateef, who made four starts. The Cornhuskers went 1-4 in their last five games.\n\nColandrea is looking to bring some much-needed dual-threat ability to an offense that's losing star running back Emmett Johnson to the NFL draft, along with veteran receiver Dane Key.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Nebraska football lands UNLV transfer Anthony Colandrea as next QB",

    "description": "As a child-free couple with remote jobs, we choose not to spend Christmas and New Year's gathering with family. Instead, we travel somewhere new.",
    "fullText": "When most of us think of the holidays, we picture spending them with family — and that's exactly what my husband and I did for over 20 years.\n\nOur tradition was to stay in Los Angeles to be with my parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins, who all lived within driving distance of our home.\n\nIt was always fun eating tamales, dancing to traditional ranchero music, and laughing at my dad's nonsensical jokes. However, as time has passed, things have changed.\n\nOld relationships ended, and new ones began, and loved ones passed away, including my dad and grandparents. Life also took a big turn once my husband and I both started working remotely in 2020.\n\nSince then, we've become much more spontaneous and creative about how we spend the holidays. We never really know where we'll be, and that's part of what makes it so exciting.\n\nMy husband and I are close to our families, so sometimes it still feels a little weird not to spend the holidays with them. But they're supportive of our travels, and we see them throughout the year.\n\nBecause we have no children or pets, we try to make the most of our flexibility and freedom. This is especially true during the holidays, when we usually have one to two weeks off from work.\n\nIt's a chance for us to rest (and reset) our minds, and enjoy each other's company without worrying about deadlines and meetings.\n\nFor the first couple of trips on our own, we stayed within driving distance of home.\n\nAfter several days in Phoenix during the 2021 Christmas holiday break, we rented a condo in the Catalina Foothills of Tucson. It had the most magnificent views of the city, and that trip remains one of my all-time favorites.\n\nAside from our daily walks among the saguaro cactuses, we didn't do anything major, which was exactly the point.\n\nIt was enough to take in the views, bask in the sunshine, and visit a couple of fantastic local spots — Coronet, a top-notch restaurant-bar with a charming outdoor patio, and Motosonora Brewing Company, a cool tap room and beer garden.\n\nThe following year, we continued the relaxed desert theme and spent the holidays in Palm Springs and Joshua Tree, where a couple of friends met up with us. We loved the wide-open skies, stunning natural landscapes, and the overall slower pace.\n\nIn 2023, we wanted to go bigger, so we splurged on a 10-day vacation to Isla Mujeres, a tiny island off the coast of Cancún.\n\nThough this wasn't our favorite trip — and we made a few mistakes planning it — swimming in the warm turquoise waters of the Caribbean was incredible, and we don't regret the experience.\n\nMost recently, we spent the 2025 to 2026 holiday season in Paris, a trip we didn't even plan until the last minute.\n\nMy husband grew up on the East Coast and has missed having a wintry Christmas ever since we've been together, so we figured we may as well go to our favorite city.\n\nIt was magical. From the gorgeous store decorations and festive street lights to the outdoor Christmas markets and cafés serving vin chaud (mulled hot wine), it felt like we were living in a holiday movie — one that we didn't want to end.\n\nFortunately, it didn't have to. Although the holidays are officially over, we were able to extend our stay in Paris through February, where we'll continue working remotely.\n\nThough we absolutely love to travel, we're not wealthy, so we're always mindful of our expenses. But when we feel it's worth it, we don't hesitate because we know life is short, nothing lasts forever, and we want to follow our bliss while we can.",

    "description": "Unnecessary characters, replacing the main star, and adding ridiculous plots are just some of the signs that it's time to call it quits.",
    "fullText": "For every show that we've mourned getting canceled prematurely, there are others chugging along on season eight that have become unwatchable.\n\nWe've compiled a list of 35 shows that didn't need to last as long as they did, whether that's because they should've stayed a limited series, the writers were running out of ideas, or simply because it took too long for the show to come out.\n\nHere are 35 shows that we think overstayed their welcome.\n\nWe were never going to be mad about more \"Stranger Things,\" but we are mad it took a decade to wrap up … and that the finale was on the underwhelming side.\n\nThis is more of a calendar problem than a content problem. When this show started, the \"Stranger Things\" kids were still actually kids. But just five seasons — and a whopping nine years later — these \"kids\" are adults. Like, \"Millie Bobby Brown is a wife and mother\" adults. Maybe that's why it was a bit laughable that the show concluded with its main characters graduating from high school.\n\nIt also became clear during the finale that perhaps this show was never suited to becoming as huge as it did. There's something to be said for seasoned franchise filmmakers knowing how to build an entire universe. The Duffer Brothers, the creators of \"Stranger Things,\" were never that.\n\nSo, was it worth the wait? We'd argue no. We're begging for shows like \"Severance\" to get a more traditional release schedule to avoid wearing out the audience's welcome.\n\nDid \"Suits\" really need to continue after Meghan Markle and Patrick J. Adams left in season seven?\n\nThe show's premise — that Adams' character Mike would be able to stay at a top law firm without a law degree for years without anyone important finding out — was always ridiculous, but the banter between Mike, his boss Harvey (Gabriel Macht), Harvey's secretary Donna (Sarah Rafferty), and paralegal Rachel (Markle), was impossible not to like.\n\nBut when real-life circumstances forced Markle to leave the show — like a royal wedding — Rachel and Mike were written off in the finale of season seven.\n\nAs the relationship between Mike and Harvey was the beating heart of \"Suits,\" it was never the same after they were gone, and the show only lasted two more seasons.\n\nThe 22nd season of \"Grey's Anatomy\" returns this month, but it has overstayed its welcome.\n\nMillions of people watch \"Grey's Anatomy,\" even after 21 years of deaths, breakups, and every natural disaster you could think of — and this show was just supposed to be about a group of surgical interns and their relationship drama!\n\nIt's hard to pinpoint when the saga of Seattle Grace Mercy West/Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital should have ended. After season five, when Katherine Heigl and T. R. Knight left? Or after season eight, when Chyler Leigh and Eric Dane decided to flee Seattle? It almost definitely should have been done after Sandra Oh left in season 10. Or you could argue that it should've been when Justin Chambers, aka the heart of the show, Alex Karev, left in season 16.\n\nHowever, now that Meredith Grey herself, Ellen Pompeo, has decided that it's time to leave Grey Sloan, it's time to pack it up.\n\nThe point is, \"Grey's Anatomy\" has been on the air way too long.\n\n\"Westworld\" was unceremoniously canceled by HBO in 2021 after four seasons, even though the show had at one point been a prestige hit and only needed one more season to wrap up its sprawling story, according to its creators.\n\nAnd now that \"Westworld\" will never get to finish its story, there's an argument to be made that it should've been a one-season limited series.\n\nBut as Business Insider's Kim Renfro pointed out, being a \"Westworld\" fan has been exhausting since season two's extremely confusing, aspect ratio-changing, time-jumping story premiered.\n\nThe first season, now, remains a perfectly entertaining season about a theme park version of the Wild West for the mega-rich who thrived off hurting the park's android population. There was much to dissect about AI, what it means to be human, and how much darkness one person can carry without losing their mind.\n\nRIP, \"Westworld,\" we barely knew you … because we had no idea what was going on half the time.\n\n\"Homeland\" is another example of a show that could've been a limited series but dragged on for eight seasons total.\n\nSpoilers ahead for a show that wrapped up its eighth and final season in 2020. And we're going to tell you a hard truth: Damian Lewis' Nicholas Brody should've died at the end of season one, and that should've been the conclusion of his and CIA case officer Carrie Mathison's story.\n\nInstead, Lewis' chemistry with Claire Danes, who played Carrie Mathison, was so strong that the show kept putting off the inevitable, spinning its wheels until his death in season three.\n\nThen, even though their relationship was the heart of the show, \"Homeland\" went on for five more seasons, each with diminishing returns.\n\n\"The Big Bang Theory\" mercifully pulled the plug after 12 seasons in 2019 and approximately one million \"Bazingas.\"\n\n\"TBBT\" was a pleasant enough show about a group of nerds (and one \"dumb\" woman), but it became way too hacky as the years went by.\n\nSheldon was reduced to a sentient pile of catchphrases (Bazinga, the soft kitty song, to name a couple), and the on/off relationship of Penny and Leonard lost its spark.\n\nThat it went on for 12 seasons, while other underrated comedies got canceled way too soon — looking at you \"Party Down,\" \"Selfie,\" and \"Happy Endings\" — is probably its biggest crime.\n\nWhile we could all use a little more President Bartlet in our lives, it's undeniable that the show lost its true magic when Sorkin, who essentially wrote every script, left after the fourth season in 2003.\n\nThat season could have been a logical endpoint to the series, with Bartlet securing a second term, and the rest of his staff living to see another day.\n\nInstead, the show soldiered on for another three seasons. None of them are bad, but they failed to achieve the same transcendence of Sorkin's episodes, before ending in 2006.\n\n\"Scrubs\" is frequently cited by medical professionals as the most realistic medical show portraying life as a doctor in a hospital, as Slate reported.\n\nIt also provided us with many laughs — and almost as many tears — across its seven seasons on NBC. The network canceled it, and ABC swooped in to pick it up for season eight in 2008.\n\nCreator Bill Lawrence provided fans with a beautiful finale that saw all of our favorite characters riding off into the sunset. Or so it seemed.\n\nABC commissioned one more season of \"Scrubs,\" known unofficially as \"Scrubs Med.\" The show was moved from a hospital to a medical school, only three of the original cast continued to star, and a bunch of new characters were introduced, much to the chagrin of audiences.\n\nThankfully, the show was really canceled after that in 2010, and many fans don't even acknowledge it as canon.\n\nBut, guess what? In 2026, we're heading back to Sacred Heart for a 10th season with Zach Braff, Donald Faison, Sarah Chalke, John C. McGinley, and Judy Reyes, so maybe we'll be taking this show off the list soon.\n\n\"Friends\" is one of the most beloved TV shows of all time, which is why it's painful to admit that it lasted at least one season too long.\n\nGranted, the show revolved around a group of six friends, so storylines were in short supply. But when Rachel and Joey started dating in season 10, after nine seasons of having no interest in each other whatsoever, it became clear that the writers had run out of material.\n\nAdditionally, the characters became loud, obnoxious caricatures of themselves. Try watching an episode from the first season of \"Friends,\" and then one from the 10th season — the differences are startling.\n\nWhen Variety reported in 2015 that HBO was adapting Liane Moriarty's best-selling novel \"Big Little Lies,\" starring Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Shailene Woodley, Laura Dern, and Zoë Kravitz, the expectations could not have been higher.\n\nAnd when it premiered in 2017, it lived up to all of them. The cast had amazing chemistry, the story was well-paced and sufficiently ominous, and the soundtrack was superb.\n\nWhen \"Big Little Lies\" won multiple Emmys in the limited-series category, it became clear that there were no plans to artificially extend the story past what Moriarty had written in the book.\n\nBut two years later, we were back in Monterey. Even though season two gave us Meryl Streep's screaming, \"Big Little Lies\" should've stayed a limited series.\n\nHollywood, stop doing this! If your show was based on a single book, it almost never pays off to extend the story — there's a reason the author didn't write a sequel.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the long-threatened third season will actually happen.\n\nThere are some who argue that there shouldn't have even been one season of \"13 Reasons Why,\" a Netflix show based on the novel of the same name. Critics claimed the show, which premiered in 2017, \"glorified\" suicide and sent the wrong message to teens.\n\nBut whether you agree with it or not, even the biggest fans of the show have to admit that the story after season one went completely off the rails.\n\nThis show started as the story of Hannah Baker (Katherine Langford), a teenager struggling with anxiety and depression, who recorded 13 tapes, each dedicated to a different person she blamed for her eventual suicide.\n\nBut by the time season four rolled around in 2020, Hannah was long forgotten, and the show had turned into a murder-mystery thriller with extra trauma thrown in for no discernible reason, as NME wrote.\n\nIf you were on Twitter (now X) during an episode of \"Pretty Little Liars,\" you might remember how captivating this show about a group of friends getting terrorized by an anonymous stalker named \"A\" used to be — it was a phenomenon.\n\nBut the show's runaway success led to it promising to reveal who the real \"A\" was every single season. Even though the identity of \"A\" was revealed in season two, more \"As\" popped up every season.\n\nHow many \"As\" could there be? The show only got more confusing as it went on, and mercifully ended after season seven in 2017 — though there were also two spinoffs.\n\n\"The Vampire Diaries\" probably should have called it quits after the show's star, Nina Dobrev, left in season six. It finally ended two years later.\n\n\"The Vampire Diaries\" originally started as a love triangle between Elena (played by Dobrev) and two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon, but as seasons went on, the show lost focus.\n\nStill, it kept going and doubled down on the (polarizing) romance between Damon and Elena. Arguably, it was never able to recreate its storytelling highs of season two.\n\nThe show's sixth season ended with Elena in a coma, and curiously continued without her for another two unnecessary seasons.\n\nWithout Elena, the main character, the show struggled, and finally came to an end after season eight in 2017 — though you could continue some characters' journeys on \"The Originals\" and \"Legacies\" until they ended in 2018 and 2022, respectively.\n\n\"One Tree Hill,\" a show about a group of high school friends in a small North Carolina town called Tree Hill, would have been great if it had said goodbye after high school graduation.\n\nThe post-high school stretch of \"OTH\" just had way too much going on, becoming confusing and soap opera-esque.\n\nThe show attempted to bypass the college problem that many high school TV shows encounter by jumping four years into the future, which was inventive at first, but became sort of ridiculous: the high level of success and fame this one group of friends had achieved was unbelievable.\n\nIt ended in 2012 after season nine, arguably five years after its prime.\n\nIn 2024, Variety reported that stars Sophia Bush and Hilarie Burton were working on an \"OTH\" revival with Netflix, so there might be more yet.\n\n\"Scandal\" became increasingly ridiculous and soapy as time went on, ultimately concluding in 2018.\n\nIt could be argued that the show never recovered from the introduction of the all-knowing, super-scary Black-Ops intelligence organization, B-613.\n\nThat's when \"Scandal\" pivoted from a political case-of-the-week drama with an ongoing love story between political \"fixer\" Olivia Pope and the US president to a frankly unwatchable soap opera in which every character either became a murderer or died, and spent most of their time yelling at someone.\n\n\"Once Upon a Time\" was rightfully canceled in 2018 after its low-rated seventh season. The show had tried to continue after ditching six of its main characters, but it would have made more sense to pull the plug.\n\nThe premise of \"Once Upon a Time\" — that fairytale characters are all real and living in a fictional town in Maine — was interesting for a season or two, but as the show went on, the connections between characters became more and more unbelievable. Plus, by the end, basically every character on the show was somehow related.\n\n\"Family Guy's\" creator, Seth MacFarlane, admitted that he has conflicting ideas about his show. In 2011, MacFarlane told The Hollywood Reporter, \"Part of me thinks that 'Family Guy' should have already ended. I think seven seasons is about the right lifespan for a TV series.\"\n\nIt's hard to argue with that, especially since the misadventures of the Rhode Island-dwelling Griffin family are wearing a little thin these days.\n\nHowever, season 24 is set to kick off in February, and as Variety reported, the show is guaranteed to air through season 29.\n\n\"Glee\" really started to go off the rails when some of the original characters graduated high school.\n\nThinking about \"Glee\" in 2023 is difficult, considering the tragedy of Cory Monteith's overdose, Naya Rivera's unexpected death, and the death of Mark Salling, who was charged with the possession of child-sexual-abuse material.\n\nBut the show probably should have taken its final bow after a couple of seasons. In a review of the 2015 series finale for Vox, one critic even wrote that the show \"got bad\" in its second episode.\n\nThe novelty of turning popular songs into show choir performances wore off quickly, and the show's replacement characters in season four, after much of the Glee Club graduated from high school, never quite worked.\n\nMany people claim that the 2012 reveal that Dan Humphrey, resident New York City \"Lonely Boy,\" was actually Gossip Girl ruined the show for them … but the show was pretty ruined long before that.\n\n\"Gossip Girl\" is an example of a show not being sustainable after the high school years. It didn't make sense that all of the main characters went to college in Manhattan: Blair, Serena, Nate, and Dan had all expressed their desire to leave the city for college.\n\nPlus, by season four, it didn't make sense for any of them to still be hanging out together. They all openly hated each other.\n\nIf there's one thing fans can agree on, it's that the final season of \"Gilmore Girls\" — a show about a young mother-daughter pair in small-town Connecticut — is a mess, due to the show's heart and soul, writer and producer Amy Sherman-Palladino, leaving in 2006.\n\nBut some argue that the mediocrity of season seven is actually her fault. Season six was a radical departure from the hijinks of perpetually happy town \"Stars Hollow,\" and instead focused on Rory and her mom not speaking, and the slow, painful demise of Luke and Lorelai's engagement.\n\nThe 2016 Netflix reboot \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" somehow made it even worse, showing that Rory had gone through little to no personal growth since the show ended, and that Lorelai and Luke had made no progress on their communication issues that had been present since their romance first began in season five.\n\n\"24\" had an innovative premise: Each week's episode was in real time, and each season covered a single day. But it definitely didn't need eight seasons, a 2008 TV movie, a 2014 revival, and a 2017 spin-off.\n\nRealistically, how many seasons of CTU (Counter Terrorist Unit) agent Jack Bauer saving the world, getting betrayed, torturing someone, and getting chased by the federal government can you watch? At least nine, its creators thought.\n\n\"24,\" which was initially praised for its inventive structure and its willingness to kill main characters and take big risks, got old pretty quickly.\n\nBut the show became formulaic after a couple of years, and the amount of pain and suffering each \"day\" put Jack through became unnecessary — his wife, four girlfriends, father, and brother are all killed over the course of the show.\n\nOne of the pillars of the Superman canon is that Clark becomes Superman when he moves to Metropolis from his small town of, well, Smallville.\n\nBut \"Smallville\" didn't get that memo, because Clark moves to Metropolis in season five with no red cape in sight. He didn't even wear the suit until the 2011 series finale (which is also when he finally learned to fly).\n\nYes, it took \"Smallville\" an excruciating 10 seasons for Clark Kent to finally become Superman.\n\nTo be fair, the creators of \"Smallville\" probably had no idea that the show would last for 10 seasons when they instituted their \"No tights, no flights\" policy, but that doesn't make it any less annoying.\n\n\"That '70s Show\" took place from 1976 to 1979, but the show lasted for eight seasons. It took five years for the core crew to graduate high school, so naturally, the show began to drag. You can only watch a group of friends sit in a basement and get stoned for so long.\n\nBut the show should have ended for good when Topher Grace, who played the main character Eric Forman, chose to leave after season seven in 2005.\n\nThen, Ashton Kutcher, who played Kelso, left after the first four episodes of season eight — and was replaced by an almost universally hated character named Randy (sorry, Josh Meyers!).\n\nFans were also angry when Fez and Jackie began a relationship, seemingly out of nowhere, effectively ending the fan-favorite relationship between Jackie and Hyde.\n\nEven though the 2023 sequel series \"That '90s Show\" (which was canceled after two seasons) confirmed that Jackie and Kelso got back together and brought back Eric, we'd be fine without it.\n\nIt became apparent that \"The Office\" was running out of stories to tell after Jim and Pam finally got married in the show's sixth season. The writers kept throwing unrealistic obstacles at them, such as a random cameraman who was suddenly in love with Pam. Adding such a melodramatic plot to a workplace sitcom like \"The Office\" (about a paper company in Pennsylvania) didn't make any sense.\n\nBut the final nail in the coffin of \"The Office\" was Steve Carell's decision to exit after seven seasons as the lovably incompetent Michael Scott.\n\nSeason eight was the first season of the sitcom to achieve a rotten score on Rotten Tomatoes. It would have been better to go out on a high note.\n\nUrban Dictionary defines jumping the shark as \"a term to describe a moment when something that was once great has reached a point where it will now decline in quality and popularity.\"\n\nWhere did such an oddly specific expression come from? Look no further than the season five premiere of \"Happy Days,\" in which Fonzie, played by Henry Winkler, literally jumps over a shark on water-skis. This stunt left people confused — wasn't this supposed to be a show about small-town '50s nostalgia?\n\n\"Happy Days\" lasted for 11 seasons from 1974 to 1984, but many people cite the jumping of the shark as a turning point in \"Happy Days\" history.\n\n\"Weeds,\" a show about a suburban single mom who grows and sells marijuana to support her family, started with such promise. It was a fascinating look at what goes on behind closed doors in suburbia — until it became more focused on drug cartels, murder, and generally unpleasant subject matter.\n\nSeasons one and two, in which Nancy (Mary-Louise Parker) is a low-level marijuana dealer in the small California town of Agrestic, are nearly perfect.\n\nBut when the show crossed the border into Mexico? Not so much.\n\nIt's borderline impossible to find someone who watched \"Weeds\" all the way until the end in 2012, when it became way too dark to enjoy.\n\n\"True Blood\" kicked off the vampire craze in 2008, a month before \"Twilight\" hit the big screen, and a year before \"The Vampire Diaries\" premiered on The CW.\n\nAnd for three seasons, it was a campy, bloody, sexy show about Sookie, a psychic waitress, her complicated relationships with hot vampires, and the lives of her family and friends.\n\nBut \"True Blood\" went downhill after it was revealed that Sookie was a fairy. She described it best when she found out the news: \"I'm a fairy? How ... lame.\"\n\nAfter this reveal, the writers scrambled to find more ways to integrate other mythological creatures, with little success.\n\nOriginal showrunner Alan Ball abandoned ship after season five, according to The Hollywood Reporter, and \"True Blood\" should have gone down with him.\n\nThe show ended on a low note in 2014, which is something that fans are still angry about to this day.\n\n\"How I Met Your Mother\" should not have gone on for nine years, simply because taking nine seasons to tell one story is almost cruel to viewers — especially the eagle-eyed, devoted fans who spent years dissecting every episode looking for clues and Easter eggs as to the identity of the titular mother.\n\nThe slow pace of the story angered both Ted's kids and fans, and the show became less funny over time.\n\nMaybe if the show had spent only four or five years building up the mother, as opposed to almost an entire decade, fans would have been able to swallow Ted and Robin (his ex-girlfriend and best friend's ex-wife) ending up together, instead of raging that it was one of the worst endings of all time.\n\nDexter was a serial killer who trained himself to only kill bad guys, but the show became less appealing, and more unrealistic, especially when writers increasingly tried to humanize Dexter.\n\nEven if you were rooting for Dexter, it became impossible to watch him face no consequences for his actions — every time someone came close to exposing him, someone else killed the threat, instead of Dexter being forced to abandon his moral code to kill an innocent person.\n\nAdditionally, the 2013 series finale has become widely regarded as one of the worst ever, although it was slightly redeemed by the subsequent revivals and prequel: \"Dexter: New Blood,\" \"Dexter: Original Sin,\" and \"Dexter: Resurrection.\"\n\nWhen \"Modern Family\" premiered in 2009, it was universally loved by fans and critics, as evidenced by high Rotten Tomatoes scores.\n\nIn fact, it was nominated for best comedy series at the Emmys seven years in a row, winning five consecutive years. It was a true 21st-century comedy, telling the story of a giant family that includes a gay couple, an interracial couple, divorce, and adoption.\n\nHowever, when it lost the award for the first time in 2015, it should've been a clue that it was probably time to start wrapping things up. Yet, the show continued, and even though it wasn't nominated for anything in 2018, it soldiered on for a 10th season.\n\nThe show finally ended in April 2020.\n\n\"Desperate Housewives\" began in 2004 as an intriguing mystery about a group of friends who were rocked by their friend Mary Alice's shocking suicide.\n\nBut as the years went by, characters became more unlikable and plots more nonsensical — remember when Edie was electrocuted after surviving a car crash? Eight seasons were just too much time to invest in the ladies of Wisteria Lane.\n\nOne of the show's titular two-and-a-half men, Charlie Sheen, left the show after eight seasons in 2011. He was dismissed after insulting the show and its creator, Chuck Lorre, Deadline reported, amongst other things, during a public meltdown.\n\nThe sitcom — about a wimpy chiropractor Alan, his underachieving son Jake, and his ladies' man brother Charlie — soldiered on for four more seasons by replacing Charlie with a depressed billionaire, Walden, who was played by Ashton Kutcher.\n\nThe show ended on a low note in 2015, with IGN writing \"don't think [we] could come up with a worse ending.\"\n\nThe truth is, the show was already in a downward spiral before Sheen left, but his departure should have been the final nail in the coffin.\n\nIn the end, it turns out \"Supernatural\" isn't immortal, like so many of its characters.\n\nThe show dealt with all sorts of otherworldly creatures, such as angels, demons, vampires, werewolves, and leprechauns, among others, and two brothers (Dean and Sam Winchester) were tasked with eradicating the world from these evils.\n\nNot many, if any, shows can remain fresh for 300 episodes. There's only so many times someone can go to hell and back before it loses its oomph, which is probably why the show ended after 15 years.\n\nIt's always a risky move when shows finally let their central couple be together — the romantic tension is usually much more fun.\n\n\"Castle\" started in 2009 as a procedural about a smarmy mystery novelist, the titular Castle, tagging along with a no-nonsense homicide detective, Beckett. The two had chemistry, and for four seasons, they danced around their obvious feelings for each other.\n\nBut when the two finally got together, the show lost some of its mojo. The show had to twist itself into knots to inject conflict into their relationship instead of letting them be happy, frustrating fans to no end throughout the next four seasons until its end in 2016.",

    "description": "Taylor Swift's new single \"The Fate of Ophelia\" debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, joining hits like \"Blank Space\" and \"Anti-Hero.\"",
    "fullText": "Despite writing ubiquitous hits like \"You Belong With Me\" and \"Love Story\" earlier in her career (which peaked at No. 2 and No. 4, respectively), \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" was Swift's first-ever song to top the Hot 100.\n\nThe country-pop crossover smash was released as the lead single from Swift's fourth album, \"Red.\" It rose from No. 72 to No. 1 in its second week of tracking and remained atop the chart for two more weeks.\n\n\"Shake It Off\" was released as the lead single from Swift's fifth album, \"1989.\" It became her first No. 1 debut on the Hot 100.\n\n\"Blank Space,\" the second single from \"1989,\" debuted at No. 18 on the Hot 100.\n\nIt rose to No. 13 before soaring to No. 1 in its third week — dethroning \"Shake It Off\" and making Swift the first woman in history to replace herself in the chart's top spot.\n\n\"Blank Space\" went on to become one of Swift's biggest hits, reigning atop the chart for nearly two months.\n\nDespite mixed reactions from critics, Swift's lead single from \"Reputation\" rose to No. 1 after its first full week of tracking, breaking the weekly streaming record for a song by a woman.\n\nOnce again, Swift's music video broke the record for most views within 24 hours, racking up 43.2 million views in its first day.\n\nSwift announced the arrival of her eighth album, \"Folklore,\" just one day in advance. The second track, \"Cardigan,\" was released at the same time as the album and promoted with a whimsical music video.\n\n\"Folklore\" debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 while \"Cardigan\" simultaneously debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, making Swift the first artist in history to open atop both charts in the same week.\n\nJust five months after \"Folklore,\" Swift repeated her pandemic-era strategy and surprise-released her ninth album, \"Evermore,\" alongside its lead single.\n\nAgain, \"Willow\" debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100 while \"Evermore\" simultaneously debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.\n\n\"Red (Taylor's Version)\" was the second rerecorded album Swift released. It was accompanied by the long-awaited 10-minute version of \"All Too Well,\" a fan-favorite track from the original album.\n\n\"All Too Well (Taylor's Version)\" was promoted with a self-directed short film and plenty of theories about the song's most likely muse.\n\nIt debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, becoming the longest song in history to top the chart. The record was previously held by Don McLean's \"American Pie (Parts I & II)\" at 8 minutes and 37 seconds.\n\n\"Anti-Hero\" was released alongside Swift's 10th album, \"Midnights,\" and promoted as the lead single.\n\nIt dominated the Hot 100 for eight weeks, surpassing the high-water mark set by \"Blank Space.\"\n\nThe same week that \"Anti-Hero\" debuted at No. 1, Swift became the first and only artist in history to occupy the entire top 10 on the Hot 100. The hit single was flanked by \"Lavender Haze\" (No. 2), \"Maroon\" (No. 3), \"Snow on the Beach\" (No. 4), \"Midnight Rain\" (No. 5), \"Bejeweled\" (No. 6), \"Question...?\" (No. 7), \"You're On Your Own, Kid\" (No. 8), \"Karma\" (No. 9), and \"Vigilante Shit\" (No. 10).\n\n\"Cruel Summer\" was originally released as the second track on Swift's 2019 album \"Lover.\"\n\nAlthough it was identified early as a fan favorite, the song was never promoted as a single and debuted modestly at No. 29 on the Hot 100.\n\nFour years later, Swift transformed \"Cruel Summer\" into a showstopping spectacle on the Eras Tour. Streams of the song began to surge, and it reigned atop Billboard's Pop Airplay chart for two months. Swift's label sent the song to pop radio in June 2023.\n\nFinally, following the release of \"The Cruelest Summer\" EP — which includes a live version of the song and a remix by LP Giobbi — the song reached No. 1 on the Hot 100, marking Swift's milestone 10th chart-topper.\n\n\"Is It Over Now?\" was released as the final vault track on \"1989 (Taylor's Version),\" a rerecording of her beloved fifth album.\n\nAlthough it wasn't initially slated as a single, its enthusiastic reception from fans pushed Swift's team to serve the song to pop radio.\n\n\"Is It Over Now?\" debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, dethroning \"Cruel Summer.\" Swift remains the only woman in history to replace herself in the top spot, a feat she's now achieved twice.\n\n\"Fortnight,\" a duet with Post Malone, was released alongside \"The Tortured Poets Department\" and promoted as the album's lead single.\n\nThe song debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100 while \"Poets\" simultaneously debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.\n\nFor the second time in her career, Swift managed to occupy the entire top 10 of the Hot 100. In fact, the top 14 positions on the chart were occupied by \"Poets\" tracks, including \"Down Bad\" (No. 2) and \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart\" (No. 3), all the way through to \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\" (No. 14).\n\n\"Fortnight\" returned to No. 1 on the Hot 100 for a second consecutive week.\n\n\"The Fate of Ophelia\" was released alongside Swift's 12th studio album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" and promoted as the lead single.\n\nThe Shakespeare-inspired pop song debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, while \"Showgirl\" simultaneously debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, breaking a record for the biggest sales week of all time.\n\nAll 12 tracks on the album debuted within the Hot 100's top 12 spots, making Swift the first and only artist to dominate the chart's top 10 on three separate occasions. \"The Fate of Ophelia\" was joined in the top five by \"Opalite\" (No. 2), \"Elizabeth Taylor\" (No. 3), \"Father Figure\" (No. 4), and \"Wood\" (No. 5).\n\n\"The Fate of Ophelia\" remained atop the Hot 100 for eight straight weeks after its release. After falling to lower positions during the holiday season, it returned to No. 1 for its ninth week, surpassing \"Anti-Hero\" as Swift's longest-leading hit to date.",

    "title": "The investor who blocked a $9 billion AI deal expects that bet to soon pay off",
    "description": "Shareholders voted down a takeover bid for Core Scientific late last year because it wasn't rich enough. Here's why they think the bet will pay off.",
    "fullText": "The investment manager who helped scuttle one of the biggest data center acquisitions of 2025 believes that his bet against the multibillion-dollar buyout is about to pay off in the new year.\n\nTrip Miller, the founder and managing partner of the Memphis-based investment firm Gullane Capital Partners, believes that Core Scientific, a data center developer and operator, is on the cusp of large new customer deals that will boost its value.\n\n\"I think over the next 90 days, you'll see them announce greater than a hundred megawatts of deals,\" Miller said. \"It would show that there was a lot more value to be tapped there than we were getting paid for under the CoreWeave deal.\"\n\nIn October, Miller, a major shareholder in Core Scientific, opposed an offer by the artificial intelligence cloud firm CoreWeave to acquire Core Scientific in a stock conversion deal that he felt undervalued the company. The purchase was originally valued at around $9 billion when it was announced in July, but fell to almost half of that when shares of CoreWeave dipped in the ensuing months. Shareholders in the firm rejected the deal in a vote on October 30 that reflected the concerns over the deal's weakened economics.\n\nMiller said that his expectation for the roughly 100 megawatts of near-term commitments was based on conversations he has had with knowledgeable parties outside of the company's management. He projected that the company will find takers for a total of roughly 400 megawatts this year, citing strong demand for AI computing power.\n\nAsked about the potential for upcoming leasing, a spokeswoman for Core Scientific said the company \"does not comment on market rumors or speculation.\"\n\nThe commitments, if they materialize, would show that data center developers with a runway for growth are increasingly valuable in an energy-constrained building boom.\n\nCore Scientific has disclosed that it has about 1 gigawatt of data center capacity and another 1.5 gigawatts of power for expansion, according to an October investor presentation.\n\nIt would also offer a competing view that the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent on data centers, computer chips, and power infrastructure are in support of a durable AI boom, not a bubble.\n\n\"We are in a situation where we're likely to be systematically short compute —where the demand for compute will outstrip the supply,\" Stephen Byrd, Morgan Stanley's global head of thematic research and sustainability research, said.\n\nIn a report published in December, Morgan Stanley suggested that one of the most significant hurdles for the AI industry will be the gargantuan loads of power required to drive its computing.\n\nMorgan Stanley projects that data centers, the vast facilities that handle the training for large language AI models and the inference computations that put them to work in everyday applications, face a 47 gigawatt shortfall of electricity from the grid nationally by 2028 — a gap almost 10 times the size of New York City's energy footprint on an average day.\n\nAmong the chief beneficiaries are crypto mining firms that have access to in-place power and utility contracts to light up new facilities quickly.\n\nBoth Core Scientific and CoreWeave were former crypto mining companies before repurposing their businesses to focus on AI in recent years.\n\nAmid the mounting shortage of power — along with headwinds in the crypto mining business — more of the industry is turning to data center computing.\n\nByrd said Morgan Stanley anticipates that about 12 gigawatts of mining facilities, about 60% the mining industry's current gigawattage, will convert over to AI and high-performance computing in the next three years.\n\nIn September, Cipher Mining announced it would build a data center in Colorado City, Texas, with 168 megawatts of computing capacity that will be leased to the AI cloud company, Fluidstack. Cipher's stock, which had been trading in August for around $5 a share, jumped as high as roughly $25 in November after the announcement.\n\nIren, another mining firm, announced a recent $9.7 billion AI cloud computing deal with Microsoft. Last month, Hut 8, said it had signed a deal to lease a 245-megawatt data center it is developing in Louisiana to Fluidstack.\n\n\"Our view is that crypto miners, by and large, are likely to pivot for the most part to delivering high-performance compute infrastructure solutions and services,\" Paul Golding, an analyst at Macquarie who covers the crypto mining industry, said.\n\nIn July 2025, CoreWeave said it had reached an agreement to acquire Core Scientific in a stock conversion. But in the months after the announcement, CoreWeave's shares declined and Core Scientific's rose, effectively reducing the value of CoreWeave's offer.\n\nSince the deal's collapse, shares of Core Scientific have traded as low as below $14 a share — less than the $17 per share price that the CoreWeave deal would have amounted to.\n\nGolding covers Core Scientific and has set a $34 target for the company's stock in October, more than double its current market price — upside that he sees stemming from its ability to tap power in a constrained utility market. That estimate is \"based on a sum of the parts that evaluated potential value for the uncontracted megawatts in the portfolio, the megawatt pipeline in load study phase, and the existing co-location deal with CoreWeave,\" Golding said.\n\nCoreWeave is Core Scientific's only data center customer, outside of legacy crypto mining facilities it operates. Core Scientific leases 590 megawatts to CoreWeave, worth roughly $10 billion in revenue over the next 12 years, according to a spokeswoman for the company. It plans to repurpose 400 megawatts of its crypto mining operations over to high-performance computing in the next three years, the spokeswoman said.\n\nMiller said that the upcoming leases he expects Core Scientific to announce will be with new customers.\n\n\"I expect them to announce deals for AI with third parties other than CoreWeave,\" Miller said.",

Mahoney, a former senior Microsoft legal executive and onetime Trump administration official, as its next chief legal officer, Axios reported.\n\nMahoney will replace Jennifer Newstead, who announced in December that she would leave Meta after more than five years to become Apple's general counsel. Mahoney is set to start on Wednesday and will report directly to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the Axios report said.\n\n\"I'm excited to join Meta as it leads the way in AI innovation and continues to connect people around the world,\" Mahoney said in a statement that Meta shared with Business Insider. \"As I close an incredible chapter at Microsoft and begin a new one at Meta, I'm grateful for the trust Mark and the Board have placed in me.\"\n\n\"C.J. brings world-class legal expertise, passion for frontier technology, and deep insight into the global regulatory challenges facing our industry,\" said Zuckerberg in a statement shared with Business Insider. \"I'm looking forward to working with him to advance Meta's mission to build the future of human connection.\"\n\nMahoney previously served as Microsoft's corporate vice president and deputy general counsel and earlier worked as deputy US trade representative during President Donald Trump's first term.\n\nIn his new role, he will oversee Meta's global legal strategy as the company continues to face scrutiny over antitrust, data privacy, online safety, and the protection of children and teenagers.\n\nNewstead's departure marked the end of a consequential period for Meta's legal team. During her tenure, the company secured a major win against the Federal Trade Commission when a federal judge rejected the agency's attempt to force Meta to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nMahoney's appointment comes as Meta continues to navigate intensifying regulatory pressure worldwide, including debates over artificial intelligence, social media governance, and data protection.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Amazon's Prime Video and MrBeast debut 'Beast Games' Season 2, offering copyright-free reactions to maximize promotion.",
    "fullText": "MrBeast is blurring the lines between YouTube and TV in a new way with the release of season two of his reality TV hit, \"Beast Games,\" on Amazon's Prime Video.\n\nThe superstar YouTuber, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, announced that the first episode will be copyright-free. That'll enable people to share reaction clips to their heart's content without fear of repercussions on platforms like Google's YouTube and Amazon's Twitch. The show kicks off on Wednesday.\n\nIt's only for one episode, but it gives MrBeast a way to have his TV cake and eat it, too — and for Amazon to juice exposure for the show.\n\nThe Amazon deal exposed MrBeast to a new audience and enabled him to create a big-budget spectacle that would have been difficult to make economically viable if it ran on YouTube. However, a potential risk was that MrBeast's fans might not follow him to Prime Video, which is behind a paywall requiring a Prime membership.\n\nLast year, MrBeast uploaded part of the first season to YouTube to ensure his fans on that platform were aware of it. MrBeast is YouTube's top creator, with over 450 million subscribers, and regularly receives more than 100 million views and numerous comments on his YouTube videos.\n\nTraditional media companies, such as Netflix and Fox, have been trying to stay relevant with younger viewers by striking deals with YouTube creators. The loss of fan interaction and decreased reach are concerns for some creators, though. In negotiating deals with podcasters, Netflix has told talent agents that it's exploring how to replicate community features for podcast hosts that it brings onto its platform.\n\nSeason 2 of \"Beast Games,\" which features 100 \"strong\" and 100 \"smart\" contestants competing for more than $10 million in prizes, blends elements of TV and digital platforms in other ways.\n\nIt'll include a crossover episode with \"Survivor,\" the famous reality TV show that \"Beast Games\" took inspiration from. And Twitch is promoting the season kickoff with a VIP screening on Tuesday featuring streamers alongside MrBeast.",

    "fullText": "Satellite imagery released in the aftermath of US airstrikes launched in support of the operation to apprehend Nicolás Maduro shows damage beyond a major military base.\n\nA satellite photo taken on Saturday by the US commercial imaging company Planet Labs PBC and obtained by Business Insider shows damage at the Higuerote Airport on Venezuela's northern coast, several dozen miles east of the capital Caracas.\n\nA crater or burn mark can be seen adjacent to the eastern end of the runway, and another on the apron near a collection of buildings.\n\nVideo shared on social media appeared to show explosions and fires at Higuerote Airport during the surprise US operation, Absolute Resolve, which began late Friday night and continued for several more hours into Saturday morning.\n\nVenezuela's air defenses are primarily comprised of Russian-made technology. US fighter jets, surveillance planes, bombers, and drones targeted these systems at the beginning of the raid, effectively clearing a path for low-flying helicopter apprehension forces to locate and capture the former president, Maduro, and his wife.\n\n\"Seems those Russian air defenses didn't quite work so well, did they?\" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said during remarks at the Newport News Shipyard in Virginia on Monday.\n\nIn addition to the damage seen at Higuerote Airport, satellite imagery taken by the US spatial intelligence firm Vantor revealed significant damage to buildings and equipment at Fuerte Tiuna, a major military installation in Caracas that houses defense ministries, critical commands, official residences, and other strategic infrastructure.\n\nConflict analysts at the Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank, said that geolocated footage indicated American forces also targeted port infrastructure, telecommunication towers, and an airbase in and around Caracas.\n\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment on the targets struck during Operation Absolute Resolve. The White House directed BI to the Saturday press briefing on the mission.\n\nMore than 150 US aircraft participated in the mission to capture Maduro, which relied on months of extensive planning and rehearsal, including building a replica of Maduro's compound that American personnel stormed. US intelligence agencies had mapped out details and patterns of his life in advance.\n\nThe operation marked a dramatic culmination of months of rising tensions between the Trump administration and Maduro, whom the US has accused of facilitating drug trafficking and other criminal activity. The ousted leader is now in New York facing narco-terrorism charges. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe US established a large military presence in the Caribbean over the past few months, deploying an aircraft carrier strike group, cruisers, destroyers, advanced fighter jets, and thousands of troops.\n\nSince early September, the US has carried out dozens of airstrikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, killing more than 100 people in a campaign that drew sharp criticism from lawmakers and legal experts.\n\nIt is unclear how long the US will maintain this force presence in the region. President Donald Trump issued warnings to several neighboring countries over the weekend — including Cuba, Colombia, and Mexico — raising concerns of additional military action. He has also threatened Venezuela with follow-on strikes if it doesn't cooperate.",

    "fullText": "Prediction platform Kalshi is looking to retain its power users with a new VIP program.\n\nKalshi has started emailing high-volume traders about a new loyalty program called \"Kalshi Platinum,\" which gives them access to merchandise and referral incentives, a company spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider.\n\nOther program perks include tickets to in-person Kalshi events and dinners, plus access to a \"dedicated account manager\" who can assist with customer support questions from 7 a.m. to 1 a.m.\n\n\"For the past couple of months, our team has been brainstorming ideas on how to best serve our most loyal customers,\" one Kalshi Platinum email read. \"After speaking with both customers and partners, we are excited to announce the launch of Kalshi Platinum to a select group of Kalshi users.\"\n\nFinancial exchanges Coinbase and Kraken, as well as sportsbooks FanDuel and DraftKings, have also implemented VIP programs. These types of programs have become particularly important to sportsbooks, which compete fiercely with each other for VIPs.\n\n\"Similar to other financial markets, brokerages, and large consumer brands, we're piloting a program that offers priority support and other benefits to some of our most loyal customers,\" a Kalshi spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nKalshi and its top rival, Polymarket, have become popular by allowing users to make money by trading contracts about the outcomes of events like elections, world events, and sports games. Kalshi announced that it had reached an $11 billion valuation in early December.\n\nUnlike sportsbooks, Kalshi operates in all 50 states and is regulated by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. However, some state regulators have targeted prediction markets like Kalshi, arguing that parts of their businesses should be overseen by gaming authorities. Kalshi disputes that notion. The company has received cease-and-desist orders from several state agencies.\n\nKalshi has recently raised its profile through data integration deals with CNBC and CNN. These networks and their websites will display data from Kalshi that shows what its users think are the probabilities of different market and economic outcomes. For example, CNN could show Kalshi prediction data about which political party users think will control the Senate after the 2026 midterm elections.",

    "description": "Business Insider is on the ground at Las Vegas CES 2026. Here's everything we learned on self-driving cars and robotaxis,",
    "fullText": "Business Insider is taking on CES 2026.\n\nI'm on the ground in Las Vegas from Tuesday to Thursday, taking in all there is to know about the latest in the driverless space.\n\nRobotaxis and self-driving cars have already had an outsize presence at the tech conference, especially in the previous hype cycle of the late 2010s and early 2020s.\n\nThings have changed since then. The industry has largely moved on from mere concepts and technology validation to: How are we going to realistically scale autonomy?\n\nIt's day one of the conference, and there's already a lot to take in.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang unveiled the Alpamayo family, which will serve as an autonomous-driving stack for OEMs to deal with those stubborn edge cases — or the \"long tail\" of self-driving.\n\nUber and Nuro showed off an early look at the Lucid Gravity SUV that the companies hope public riders will be able to take by late 2026.\n\nI'll be spending less time at keynotes and speaker events and more on real-life demonstrations and meetings with industry leaders and commentators in autonomy\n\nThink of this as my personal notebook, where I jot down everything I've learned and seen at the conference.\n\nCheck back in for more updates.\n\nThis is the first year Zoox, an Amazon-backed robotaxi company, will be giving live demonstrations of its service during CES.\n\nI got to take a ride in one on Monday night in front of Resorts World. (The company tagline that I saw from an ad at the Harry Reid International Airport was: \"Don't just do the Strip. Zoox it.\")\n\nMy immediate thoughts were that Zoox feels unlike any other robotaxi or pseudo-robotaxi on the market. It felt more like I was on a theme park ride than in an everyday car we're familiar with.\n\nUnlike Waymo's robotaxis, Zoox is not a regular car you could buy that's been retrofitted with sensors. The Zoox car is bi-directional — meaning there's no real front or back of the car — and the inside has no steering wheel, just seats.\n\nThe robotaxis were clearly a great tourist attraction from what I saw. My Uber driver wasn't too happy about them.\n\nUber, Lucid, and Nuro had a swanky cocktail hour at Fontainebleau Las Vegas, where they quite literally wined and dined a room full of reporters, analysts, and investors: endless glasses of wine and an open bar, lobster tails, jumbo shrimp, too many appetizers to count, and a giant charcuterie board — the works.\n\nMaybe understandably so? 2026 will be a big year for the three companies.\n\nUber's plan is to roll out a robotaxi service by late 2026. The first market is San Francisco, where Uber will directly compete with Waymo. These two companies are partners in other markets, like Austin.\n\n\"We've been moving very, very quickly,\" Nuro's co-CEO and cofounder Dave Ferguson said. \"We signed this partnership last July. We're already testing the production-intent vehicles on public roads. And very soon, we're going to have tens of thousands of them worldwide.\"",

    "description": "The defense contractor said it plans to increase annual production of advanced Patriot missile interceptors from 600 to 2,000.",
    "fullText": "Lockheed Martin plans to dramatically ramp up production of Patriot missile interceptors, aiming to more than triple its annual output to 2,000, the defense contractor said on Tuesday.\n\nLockheed said that it had reached an agreement with the US Department of Defense to \"rapidly accelerate\" the production and delivery of its PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) interceptors over a seven-year period.\n\nThe new agreement will increase the annual production capacity of PAC-3, or Patriot Advanced Capability, interceptors from roughly 600 to 2,000. These will then be delivered to US, allied, and partner forces.\n\nGlobal demand for capable air defenses and interceptors has surged in recent years in response to the large missile attacks seen in Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine and in Middle East conflicts. The American-made MIM-104 Patriot air defense system has been at the center of both.\n\nThe surface-to-air missile system has served as the backbone of Ukraine's defense against Russian missile strikes, functioning as the top layer of an air defense network largely supported by Western-made technology. And the US military has relied on the Patriot to intercept Iranian attacks.\n\nThe high expenditure rate for Patriot interceptors over the last few years has raised concerns about future stockpiles for US and allied arsenals.\n\nJim Taiclet, Lockheed's chairman and CEO, said in a statement that the defense prime \"will create unprecedented capacity for PAC-3 MSE production, delivering at the speed our nation and allies demand.\"\n\nLockheed said that it had boosted PAC-3 MSE production by more than 60% over the past two years and delivered 620 missile interceptors in 2025, a 20% increase from 2024.\n\nThe contractor supplies 17 countries with its PAC-3 interceptors. It considers the MSE variant a \"cornerstone\" of US and European missile defense.\n\nThe Pentagon said that the agreement announced on Tuesday is a result of its new Acquisition Transformation Strategy, which Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth revealed in November and calls for increased production capacity for key weapons and munitions, among other priorities.\n\nHegseth said at the time that the Pentagon would award companies bigger and longer contracts for \"proven systems\" so that they could invest \n\nThe framework agreement announced on Tuesday \"establishes the basis for negotiating a seven-year supply contract\" that will still need Congressional approval, the Pentagon said.\n\n\"This framework agreement marks a fundamental shift in how we rapidly expand munitions production and magazine depth, and how we collaborate with our industry partners,\" said Michael Duffey, the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, in a statement.",

    "fullText": "Seven US service members were injured during the covert raid to apprehend Nicolás Maduro over the weekend, a defense official told Business Insider on Tuesday, sharing the latest update on their condition.\n\nFive of the wounded troops have already returned to duty, while two others are still recovering from their injuries, the official said.\n\n\"They are receiving excellent medical care and are well on their way to recovery,\" they said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump initially revealed Saturday morning, several hours after the operation had wrapped up, that \"a couple of guys were hit\" as US forces stormed Maduro's compound to apprehend Venezuela's now-former president and his wife, Cilia Flores.\n\nTrump later shared that all the injured service members were in \"good shape.\" He added that no US troops were killed, and no equipment was lost in this operation. A helicopter took a hit but remained operational.\n\n\"The fact that this extremely complex and grueling mission was successfully executed with so few injuries is a testament to the expertise of our joint warriors,\" the defense official said.\n\nIt's unclear what kind of injuries the troops sustained during the mission or how they were hurt. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, said on Monday that nearly 200 US personnel entered \"downtown Caracas\" as part of the operation.\n\nThe surprise US operation, called Absolute Resolve, followed months of extensive planning and rehearsal, including building a replica of Maduro's compound. On Saturday, Trump described the facility as a \"highly guarded\" building, \"like a fortress.\"\n\nLow-flying helicopters brough in apprehension teams, which included law enforcement officers and special operations forces, while dozens of other aircraft — from fighter jets and bombers to drones — cleared a path for them by striking Venezuela's air defenses.\n\nDan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters on Saturday that \"those in the air over Caracas last night were willing to give their lives for those on the ground and in the helicopters.\"\n\nAmerican forces stormed the compound under heavy fire. At some point during the operation, which began late Friday night and continued for several hours into Saturday morning, the troops were wounded. The US said everyone made it out though.\n\nDozens of Venezuelan and Cuban security personnel were killed during the US raid, according to the two militaries.",

    "title": "Greenlanders tell us Trump's talk of buying the island crossed a line",
    "description": "Many Greenlanders are interested in working with the US, but they all bristle at the idea of being bought or taken by force.",
    "fullText": "If Greenlanders weren't concerned by President Donald Trump's threats to annex the territory in his first term, many of them are now.\n\nIn the days since the United States' surprise raid into Venezuela, there's been a renewed focus on Trump's interest in the island, sparking fear among locals.\n\n\"I don't know what he's able to do. Most of me is trying to tell myself, 'Don't worry, everything's going to be fine,' but still I'm worried,\" Tupaarnaq Kreutzmann Kleist, a sheep farmer in South Greenland, told Business Insider's Sarah Andersen on Tuesday.\n\nCasper Frank Møller, CEO and cofounder of Greenland tourist company Raw Arctic, echoed Kleist's concerns, saying that he and many of his peers are worried about how the situation may affect their finances.\n\n\"We've made investments into developing our tourism aspects of our company, and it comes with risk now because of the geopolitical situation and the threats by Trump, so of course, yeah, we're all really worried,\" he told Business Insider on Tuesday.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider on Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Trump and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue Greenland, including \"utilizing the US Military.\"\n\nTrump's had his sights set on the Arctic island, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, since his first term in office. He has argued that Greenland's location makes it strategically important, as the melting of Arctic ice opens up new shipping routes and intensifies competition with Russia and China. The island is also rich in critical minerals and already hosts a key US military base, which American officials say is vital to missile defense and Arctic security.\n\nWhen Trump initially raised the topic of buying Greenland in 2019, Greenlandic influencer and engineer Qupanuk Olsen told Business Insider she and other locals thought it was a joke, and said she still didn't take it seriously when Trump resurfaced talks in late 2024.\n\nThat changed when Donald Trump Jr. visited Nuuk in January 2025. \"That's when we realized that Trump's words were no longer just words,\" Olsen said in June. \"They are real, and he means what he says.\" Business Insider wasn't able to reach Olsen this week for a follow-up.\n\nIn the wake of the raid on Venezuela, Møller said on Tuesday that Trump's threats to annex Greenland feel \"much more realistic that it will actually happen\" than when he spoke with Business Insider in January 2025.\n\nUS interest had at least one positive effect, Olsen said in June: It pushed Greenlanders to think more seriously about their place in the world and the need to speak for themselves.\n\n\"It was such a huge wake-up call for everyone in Greenland because suddenly we needed to have an opinion whether we still want to stay under Denmark, whether we should become independent, or whether we should become a state under the United States,\" she said. \"We certainly had options. So those options were helpful in the beginning for the independence movement.\"\n\nThat mindset may be shifting. Kleist said she's worried that \"we as the local indigenous Greenlandic people are slowly going against each other now,\" she told Business Insider on Tuesday. Some want to stand with America, others with Denmark, she said. Ultimately, though, the dream is for Greenland to become its own independent country, she added.\n\n\"We want Greenland to be the Greenlanders, and we're not for sale. We are not to be taken over,\" Møller said.\n\nNaaja Nathanielsen, Greenland's minister of natural resources, business, energy, justice, and gender equality, said in June that she sees much of the American administration's interest in Greenland as an opportunity for collaboration. But she said the way Trump is going about it is wrong.\n\n\"I think if we take the temperature down a bit and de-escalate the conflict level and the rhetoric, I think we can, in agreement with each other, find many paths forward that are mutually beneficial for both the US and for us,\" Nathanielsen said in June. \"But we don't appreciate being talked about as a commodity, as something you can buy or sell or acquire or take. That is, of course, offensive to all people.\"\n\nIn an email on Tuesday, Nathanielsen told Business Insider that she stands by what she said in June.\n\n\"The people of Greenland find the current situation unsettling, and it causes a great deal of anxiety,\" she wrote. \"We will continuously promote the idea of alliances and partnerships over colonialism. We have had our share of that.\"\n\nDenmark, Trump has argued, is not doing enough to safeguard Greenland. \"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security,\" Trump told a group of reporters on Air Force One on Sunday.\n\nThe same day, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen urged the US in a statement to \"stop the threats against a historically close ally.\" Frederiksen has previously rejected Trump's suggestions outright, telling him that Greenland is not for sale and that any idea of annexation is \"absurd.\"\n\nFrederiksen has warned that any US military action against Greenland would severely damage NATO unity, raising questions about whether the alliance could withstand such a conflict between allies.\n\nOn Tuesday, major European leaders, including those from France, Germany, the UK, Italy, Spain, Poland, and Denmark, released a joint statement defending Greenland. \"Greenland belongs to its people,\" the statement said. \"It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"",

    "description": "The Google cofounder has severed ties between California and several of his business entities, including his family office.",
    "fullText": "Billionaire Larry Page is peacing out of California.\n\nThe Google cofounder has cut ties between California and many of his assets that risked exposing him to a proposed new wealth tax in the state, meeting an end-of-2025 deadline, according to filings reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nPage's family office, Koop, was converted out of California in late December and incorporated in Delaware, per filings with both states. Page converted several other entities to Delaware, including Flu Lab LLC — a vehicle he has used to fund research on tackling influenza and lists its principal office address in Nevada — and another entity named One Aero, which has funded his flying car ventures and lists its principal office address in Florida.\n\nA filing was also made to convert Dynatomics, LLC from California to Delaware with a new principal address in Keller, Texas. Page launched Dynatomics, a new startup focused on applying AI to aircraft manufacturing, in 2023, Business Insider previously reported. A source close to Page said that the team, run by Chris Anderson, continues to work out of California.\n\nAnderson and representatives for Page's family office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe New York Times reported in December that Page had told people he was considering moving to Florida because of a proposed ballot measure that would tax the state's wealthiest residents. The proposal, if passed successfully, would mean that any California resident worth more than $1 billion would be taxed 5% of their assets.\n\nUnder California law, residency is determined by the nature of a person's ties to the state, with factors such as the time spent in the state and the maintenance of substantial business ties taken into account. If the ballot measure is approved in November, it would take effect retroactively for residents living in California as of January 1, 2026.\n\nA source close to Page said the Google cofounder had already left the state. Whether Page's move is temporary could not be learned.\n\nPage is ranked the second-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nBesides his family office and funding vehicles, Page converted out an LLC that Business Insider previously identified as being used to purchase islands in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, from California to Delaware, with a new address listed in Florida.\n\nA separate LLC Page used to purchase an Island in Fiji was also converted out to Delaware.\n\nPage's wife, the scientist Lucinda Southworth, founded a marine-conservation charity named Oceankind. Filings show that Oceankind converted out of California to Delaware in December.\n\nDelaware has become a popular state for businesses to incorporate due to its favorable tax structure, privacy, and its home to a court system specifically designed to handle corporate disputes. The state does not require LLCs to disclose the names and addresses of directors when incorporating, providing them with an extra layer of privacy.\n\nPrivacy is especially important to Page, whose family office is shrouded in a level of secrecy unparalleled by most and carefully managed by its CEO, Wayne Osborne.\n\nCristina Rosado, an attorney who handles many of Page and Southworth's assets, signed several of the California filings.\n\nPage incorporated three entities in Florida last year, as previously reported by The New York Times. A Koop LLC was incorporated in Florida in January 2025, per filings reviewed by Business Insider. It could not be confirmed if it belongs to Page.\n\nThe California billionaire tax proposal faced some opposition from leaders in venture capital and politics. In a post on X in December, venture capitalist Vinod Khosla said the proposed measure would mean California would lose its most important taxpayers and \"net off much worse.\"\n\n\"Long term damage unless legislature bans wealth taxes,\" he added. \"Easier to equalize taxes on work income and capital gains at the national level.\n\nMatt Mahan, Democratic mayor of San Jose, California, on Monday described the tax as \"a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy.\"\n\nWhite House AI czar David Sacks has criticized the proposal and said it will backfire. He has also said he believes Miami and Austin will overtake New York and San Francisco for finance and tech, respectively. He announced this month that his venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, had opened an office in Austin.\n\nLast month, celebrity lawyer Alex Spiro wrote a letter to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, warning that the proposed billionaire tax would \"trigger an exodus of capital and innovation from California,\" Business Insider previously reported.\n\nHave something to share?

    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

    "description": "It took creativity (and money), but now I can cook in my little kitchen.",
    "fullText": "Last year, one of my New Year's resolutions was to overhaul my apartment and turn it into a cleaner, more comfortable, more organized, and more efficient space. Knowing that a messy space can negatively impact your productivity and overall mental health, I reasoned that this would actually serve the purpose of making me a more efficient, peaceful person, so I took it seriously. One major issue was quickly apparent: My kitchen is tiny, which meant it was disorganized and more or less useless when it came to its primary function, which is to facilitate my cooking. It took some creativity (and money), but I figured out what to do—and now I'm learning to cook and bake better for one of this year's resolutions.\n\nMy kitchen is a little over three feet wide and five feet long. (I live in NYC, where this is the norm.) There is no counter space; all there is along one side is a sink and an oven. The first thing I had to do was manufacture counter space, which I did by adding cubed storage shelving. (I did this years ago, but only truly organized the cubes last year. We're getting to that.) It looks like this:\n\nThe main things I thought of, besides organizing the cubed storage, were how I could better utilize what space I did have, which is why anything and everything possible is now hanging vertically on under-cabinet wine glass racks, utensil holders, or a towel rack, plus hooks all over. What I'm most excited for is the impending delivery of this big peg board, which is going to allow me to hang more utensils and cookware on the wall.\n\nOther, smaller improvements became more obvious to me as I worked through organizing the big stuff. Once I cleared out and designated a suitable spot for my Nespresso, I figured out I needed a vertical, adhesive-backed holder for the pods, since there wasn't enough room in the cubes to hold them in their retail boxes. I finally bought a big ladder so I could actually use my cupboards. I then set about organizing the cupboards with acrylic risers, the same way I organized my perfume and makeup. For the area under the sink, I bought a pull-out shelf to give me easy access to cleaning materials. The boxes containing my various grains and oats were too unwieldy to keep in my cupboards, which led me to a rotating rice dispenser. It went on that way for a while, with me paying tribute to the Amazon gods every few days, but it was all because I had a bigger plan.\n\nYou may not want a giant peg board or need to hang all your spatulas upside-down. Maybe you have lots of drawers. That's cool. You still need a plan for organizing whatever you've got and a plan for figuring out what you, specifically, need.\n\nThroughout the organizing process, I kept a key principle in mind. It's called the Organizational Triangle and it's a set of three rules: Everything needs a place, similar items must be stored together, and for every new thing that comes in, one should go out. I ignored the last rule, for the most part, because what I was bringing in was meant to store what was already there better, but those first two were crucial. Prior to using the OT, not everything had a place. Some bowls and mugs lived in the sink. Not everything was stored together, either, which made it a pain to attempt to cook. By grouping similar items and designating each of them a spot, I could assess the volume of each category, get rid of what I didn't need, and better organize everything. By organizing smaller batches of things that would fit into one cube or on one hanging rack, I ended up organizing the whole thing, big-picture-style.\n\nOther cleaning and organizing techniques, like SIMPLE and Core 4, were also instrumental. Both of these advise that you need containers for your things. Again, this helps you assess actual volume and make sharper decluttering choices, but it also keeps everything neat. I got a little abstract in my interpretation, considering my hanging organizers \"containers,\" but also used boxes and the aforementioned grain dispenser to meet those requirements.",

    "description": "And you can already buy them.",
    "fullText": "Anker launched a pair of \"2-in-1\" earbuds under its Soundcore brand at CES 2026, and it has a unique feature: They can be worn in two ways by adjusting the ear hooks. When you want active noise cancellation, you can wear it in-ear, and when you don't, you can adjust the hooks for an open-ear design. This quirky product is called the Soundcore Aerofit 2 Pro—and you can already buy it for $150, which includes a launch discount of $30.\n\nWhen it comes to CES announcements, I'm always wary of vaporware, aka products that are announced but never shipped. That's why I keep an eye out for products with a shorter launch window so you can actually get your hands on the things you're excited about. The Soundcore Aerofit 2 Pro is one of those products. As Anker itself admits on the product page, the Aerofit 2 Pro isn't for everyone. The biggest quirk of this product is its size. It's a lot bigger than most ANC earbuds, and the ear hooks go all the way around your ears, which isn't a fit that works for everyone. The charging case is also quite large, when compared with other ANC earbuds: It's 4.23 inches (11cm) wide, and it supports wireless charging.\n\nMost noise-cancelling headphones let you switch to a listening mode that allows ambient sounds via software, but the Aerofit 2 Pro lets you do this by physically twisting the earbuds. This adjustment seems quite seamless based on the demo video on the product page, but I haven't tested it in-person, so I'll reserve my judgment until I do. There are five levels of adjustment for the ear hooks, with levels 1 and 2 reserved for open-ear listening, and 4 and 5 for noise cancellation. Level 3 maintains your previous listening mode to prevent accidentally switching to a different mode.",

    "title": "12 Shows Like 'Heated Rivalry' You Should Watch Next",
    "description": "The cottage has wi-fi now.",
    "fullText": "My Canadian in-laws include a famous (I'm told) ice hockey star, and yet I've still spent more time engaging with hockey via the HBO Max streaming sensation Heated Rivalry than from the stands of any actual court or rink or whatever it is you call the place where people pass around their pucks. Not that I know any more about the game after watching, because frankly, that's not why we're here, nor is that what the buzz is all about.\n\nHeated Rivalry is all about the very horny relationship between Japanese-Canadian team captain Shane (Hudson Williams) and Ilya (Connor Storrie), a headstrong Russian playing for a different team (not a euphemism). Even as their public relationship remains contentious over a period of years, the two develop a casual (at least at first) sexual relationship that grows increasingly sweaty and romantic, ice notwithstanding. Not to be outdone, the show also traces the complicated relationship between an American team captain and a smoothie barista.\n\nIn the increasingly backward-looking world of streamer programming, Heated Rivalry managed to draw eyes and a renewal by being the horniest, gayest show out there. Once you've binged it, you can follow up with one of these steamy streamalikes.\n\nIt's a short flight from horny gay ice hockey in Canada to horny gay figure skating in Japan and, yet, Yuri on Ice has just been sitting there waiting to be rediscovered. One of the best-reviewed anime of the last decade or so, the show finds defeated 23-year-old skater Yuri Katsuki returning to his hometown in Kyushu before an impromptu routine goes viral and draws the attention of Victor, a former champ who hopes to coach Yuki to revive his own career. The developing relationship is complex and compellingly twisty, and the animation is gorgeous; the show also gets a lot of credit for accuracy from both figure skaters...and pole dancers. Stream Yuri on Ice on Hulu and Crunchyroll.\n\nA standout of its year that, of course, got cancelled, the show expands on the 1992 film of the same name, diving further into the real-life story of the Rockford Peaches, women's professional baseball team in 1943. Abbi Jacobson, Chanté Adams, and D'Arcy Carden star as Carson, Max, and Greta, all three characters queer, either comfortably or in a process of exploration. Lest that sounds like some kind of ultra-woke revisionism, the show, while highly fictionalized, approaches the LGBTQ+ makeup of the Peaches far more accurately than did the earlier movie (despite including both Rosie O'Donnell and Madonna among its cast). Stream A League of Their Own on Prime Video.\n\nSex, desire, and queer longing in the high-pressure world of competitive sports? Sounds like a theme. This Spanish-language show involves young athletes at the Pirineos Center of High Performance (better them than me), battling to be the best in their respective sports and, with a bit of luck, earning sponsorship deals with the global fashion brand of the title. The central, steamy, but secretive relationship is between Roque Pérez (Agustín Della Corte) and Sebas Senghor (Juan Perale)—think Heated Rivalry, but in Spanish and with rugby. Stream Olympo on Netflix.\n\nLena Waithe created this comedy following Hattie, an aspiring screenwriter and queer Black woman navigating life and work in LA with her straight besties, Marie (Christina Elmore) and Nia (Gabrielle Graham). The tone is loose and funny, involving friends who spend as much time trash-talking as they do working, but there's still a sense of young people in a hyper-competitive industry fighting to make it. Stream Twenties on Paramount+ and BET+.\n\nTonally, this time-jumping survival drama is a total mismatch, but I'm throwing it in the mix for its blend of sports and queer characters, especially leads Taissa (Jasmin Savoy Brown) and Van (Liv Hewson). The show is about a group of teenage girls becoming stranded in the wilderness on the way to a soccer match in 1996 and doing terrible things to survive—the extent of which we only learn about via flashbacks from the present, where the events of those 19 months continue to have an impact. There are ambiguous teases of the supernatural, and plenty of horror unfolds in a past that we're still seeing fleshed out going into the fourth and final season. The show rather cynically posits that there's a huge difference between the version of the past we talk about and the one that really happened. Stream Yellowjackets on Paramount+ and Netflix (for the first two seasons).\n\nSteamy soap Young Royals follows Wilhelm (Edvin Ryding), the fictional prince of Sweden, as he embarks on a romance with another student, Simon Eriksson (Omar Rudberg), at their elite boarding school—it's not hockey, but there's no shortage of intense competition among these attractive young queers and their classmates. While possessed of all the addictive qualities of the teen drama genre, Young Royals takes itself a bit more seriously than some, and feels remarkably fresh in its commitment to casting age-appropriate actors in all the key roles. Stream Young Royals on Netflix.\n\nA fun comedy-drama set during the 1980s, GLOW’s ensemble is lead by Alison Brie as Ruth Wilder, a serious yet very out-of-work actor who signs on with Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling, a fictionalized version of the real sports organization of the same name. The show’s heightened drama, period detail, and willingness to be a little silly were highlights, as were the multiple queer characters: the growing relationship between Yolanda (Shakira Barrera) and Arthie (Sunita Mani) is a prominent focus; menwhile, Bash, the wrestling producer, explores his own sexuality amid the Reagan-era AIDS crisis. Stream GLOW on Netflix.\n\nLet's say that you're into Heated Rivalry for the hockey. Which: sure. To each their own. If so, you could do a lot worse than this (largely standalone) Letterkenny spin-off, starring and created by Jared Keeso, who also plays the title character. The veteran player moves to the small-ish city of Sudbury, Ontario after making a bet that he can save the struggling Sudbury Bulldogs. The comedy is simultaneously raunchy and sweet (think Ted Lasso), with some solid queer rep among some of the secondary characters. More to the point, perhaps, is the involvement of executive producer and frequent director Jacob Tierney, who just happens to have also created Heated Rivalry. Stream Shoresy on Hulu.\n\nComedian Benito Skinner plays himself, kinda, in this buzzy comedy that sees a former high school jock facing his freshman year in college while desperately trying to convince himself and everyone else that he's as straight as they come (relatable, except for the jock part). Much of the appeal is in its deft blending of tones: It's a frequently raunchy college comedy, and simultaneously a sweet coming-of-age story about accepting yourself without worrying about what everyone else thinks. The cast includes Adam DiMarco (The White Lotus) and Rish Shah (Ms. Marvel) and, just like Heated Rivalry, it's a streaming show with queer leads that's actually been renewed. Stream Overcompensating on Prime Video.\n\nAnother BL anime (as in \"Boy's Love,\" a significant sub-genre), Given follows four adults who come together to form the titular rock band, with music connecting the characters while also helping them to navigate past trauma. The manga on which the show is based interweaves several gay storylines, but the anime puts a focus on the growing relationship between Ritsuka and Mafuyu, whose guitarist boyfriend died by suicide. In common with Heated Rivalry, it's about navigating a complicated relationship in a high-pressure environment. Stream Given on Crunchyroll or buy it from Prime Video.\n\nThere were a few impressive LGBTQ+ shows this past season, with Boots generating buzz and predating both Pluribus and Heated Rivalry by just about a month. Alas, while those two survived the (more than) annual streaming purge, Boots didn't make it out of camp. Based on a memoir from Greg Cope White, the Netflix series stars Miles Heizer as Cameron Cope, a closeted gay teen who follows his bestie into the Army in the era before \"Don't ask, don't tell,\" and well before serving in the open was a possibility. Stream Boots on Netflix.\n\nThe affirming coming-of-age/queer teen love story that we all kinda need right about now, Heartstopper is more about kisses and significant glances than it is about the hot, illicit sex of Heated Rivalry—and do with that what you will. While it never soft-peddles the dangers of homophobia, it likewise doesn’t wallow in tragedy. Kit Connor and Joe Locke deliver sensitive (and often very funny) performances in a show that’s nearly all smiles without feeling treacly. Stream Heartstopper on Netflix.",

    "description": "Forget overpriced cleaner apps—Mole does it all for free.",
    "fullText": "There are a lot of apps on the market that claim to \"clean up\" your Mac—for a price. Some offer subscriptions, some cost a lot up front, but for the most part, they offer the same few features—wiping things like caches and logs, completely uninstalling apps, and monitoring system health. These apps all tend to be a little on the bloated side, with a lot of animations and graphics.\n\nThe free, open source, Terminal-based Mole is the opposite of those applications. Running entirely from the command line, Mole couldn't possibly look less flashy, but it combines a number of different tools that can free up hard drive space on your Mac while also keeping things running smoothly.\n\nTo get started, you'll need to install Mole. The simplest way to do this is by using Homebrew, which any Mac user interested in a Terminal-based application should probably do anyway. There is, alternatively, a script you can use to install Mole on the download page.\n\nTo use the application, just type \"mole\" in the Terminal and hit enter—you'll be presented with the five main tools offered: Clean, Uninstall, Optimize, Analyze, and Status. (You can, alternatively, type \"mole\" followed by the tool you want to use—more on that later.)\n\nThe first, Clean, scans your hard drive for caches and temporary files, then deletes them. The application explains what it's doing every step of the way, and you can always do a dry run using the command mole clean --dry-run if you'd like to see an overview before affecting any system files.\n\nThe second tool, Uninstall, presents you with a list of applications installed on your computer and lets you know how much storage space they're using. You can select as many applications as you want with the spacebar, then hit enter in order to completely remove them. This doesn't just uninstall the application itself—it also removes all associated files, including settings.\n\nThe third tool, Optimize, performs a number of routine maintenance tasks such as flushing the DNS cache, optimizing databases, and refreshing the Finder. I find this useful when my Mac is hanging for seemingly no reason.\n\nThe fourth tool, Analyze, lets you see which folders are taking up the most space on your hard drive—useful if you're trying to free up disk space on your Mac. You'll see a list of folders alongside how much space they're taking up. Open a folder to see a breakdown of the folders and files inside it. I was able to find a number of large files using this tool, some of which I didn't need anymore.\n\nThe final tool, Status, is a simple dashboard with stats including CPU, memory, and hard drive usage alongside an animated ascii-art cat. It's simple.\n\nIt's all very straight forward to use, and there are generally instructions on the screen telling you what to do next. One thing I do want to point out is that you can run most of these tools directly from the Terminal, without the initial menu. You can, for example, type mole clean to run the cleaner or mole status to open the dashboard. You can",

    "title": "CES 2026: I Tried a Gaming Headset That Can Read Your Mind",
    "description": "Lock in before you drop in.",
    "fullText": "Before this CES, I thought gaming headsets had gotten about as complex as they ever would. How many improvements can you possibly make on speakers and microphones? Well, forget all that. Apparently, the future of gaming headsets is mind reading.\n\nIn a private demo with a colleague from IGN, I tested out a collaboration between HP's HyperX gaming brand and brain-computer interface company Neurable. Neurable's been at CES before, but most of its work has been in the defense and enterprise sectors. The brand is specifically aimed at helping you nail down your focus, and now, Neurable thinks it can use that to help gamers.\n\nBefore trying on the Neurable x HyperX headset, I did a quick run-through in a target shooting game, where I shot down 30 targets with a 547ms response time. Then, I was guided through a focus program called Prime. This showed a cloud of dots on the screen, and I was told to do whatever I needed to do to focus up. I decided to stare into the distance and count, and in about 90 seconds, the dots had shrunken down into a small orb and I was \"primed.\" Neurable also suggested focusing techniques like repeating a word in your head over and over, or following one of the dots as it moved about the screen, but these didn't work for me.\n\nThen, I did the shooting test again. Theoretically, I should have been better, but I actually scored slightly worse this time—a 559ms response time. Still, that response time isn't terrible, and your mileage may vary. I might have already been locked in before priming. In contrast, my colleague actually reduced her response time by about 40ms after priming. If all of that optimization sounds really nitty-gritty, it is. This is aimed at esports players and streamers, where every millisecond counts.\n\nThat's probably where the headset's coolest feature comes in for me. Alongside Prime, Neurable and HyperX are also working on an overlay plugin for streamers that can show their focus levels on screen. You can display this as a speedometer, or as that cloud of dots, or even as a progress bar that shows whether you're \"on tilt\" or not. It should make for some pretty fun interactions with viewers, and play well with existing plug-ins, like eye trackers that show where a streamer is looking.\n\nPlus, my slightly worse response time after priming wasn't totally useless. Neurable said the headset could be used to help you \"practice choking,\" where you psych yourself up shortly after locking in and end up worse off. I thought that sounded like marketing spin, but my colleague, a high-level raider in World of Warcraft, said it would have real use for her.\n\nIt's still just a concept for now, but it's exciting to see this kind of tech getting ready to hit the mass market. What also sets Neurable apart is how portable it is. Unlike other brain-computer interfaces, this just looks like a normal headset, and all the contacts are just stored in the ear cups. There's no need for a giant helmet with discs and wires attached to it, thanks to Neurable's expertise in AI. The company says that using such a compact form factor does result in getting a small amount of data (and a lot of junk data, at that), but thanks to an on-device AI model, it's easily able to detect trends in your focus and translate them into something usable.\n\nThat seemed to be true in my demo, which at the end of the day, kind of felt like a guided meditation with real-time feedback. You could use this for more than gaming, but it's a clever use case for digital mind-reading, and the streaming plugins really take the cake, helping solidify the concept into a clear product with a concrete goal and target audience.\n\nIt'll take a while for the gaming version of Neurable's tech to be ready, although the company said it hopes to get it out this year. In the meantime, you can buy an ultra-luxury headset with Neurable's mind-reading built in, although it's currently on pre-order and will set you back $500. It also won't come with Prime or that streaming plugin, although because those are based in software, that could change in the future.",

    "title": "CES 2026: XREAL's New Gaming Glasses Put a Huge, Fast Gaming Monitor Right on Your Face",
    "description": "Asus and XREAL are working together to make the big screen better for gaming, and smaller than ever before.",
    "fullText": "I've been a fan of XREAL for a while, but outside of people who are really into AR, it's still a lesser-known company. Lifehacker has given XREAL's glasses stellar reviews before, but in the company's new collaboration with Asus, it's aiming to expand its market. The new ROG XREAL R1 AR glasses are the first XREAL glasses aimed specifically at gaming (though its other models aren't exactly bad for gaming), and they basically put the best gaming monitor you could ever want right in front of your face.\n\nYou wear these like a normal pair of sunglasses, and you get a massive 171-inch virtual TV floating in a black void right in front of you. It's an OLED, so there are crisp colors and high contrast, and the resolution is a respectable 1080p. Most importantly, the glasses max out at a 240Hz refresh rate, meaning they can display up to 240 frames per second.\n\nTaken all together, that's better than pretty much all of the full-size desktop monitors I have at home, but these are portable. They're barely heavier than my reading glasses, too, and you can set your virtual screen to either be anchored in one spot (meaning it won't follow your head) or stay in front of your eyes at all times. I prefer the former, since it shakes around less.\n\nI also didn't get any of the usual problems I have with AR or VR, like light bleed or fuzzy graphics. Aside from the black void, this really did feel like looking at a real-life screen. And you don't even have to use the full 171 inches, if you prefer something smaller.\n\nAside from the glasses, Asus is also shipping these with a dock, to help you better use them with your various devices. It has two HDMI ports and one DisplayPort connection, so you can have up to three devices ready to go at one time. It's probably the most realistic way to simulate gaming on a movie theater screen, and it's only set to improve down the line. Asus told me these glasses will eventually support XREAL's 2D-to-3D conversion tech, which just came out on the new XREAL 1S glasses and automatically converts any image to 3D. The effect uses AI to determine how to split the image between your eyes, but it was so convincing to me when I tried it with Mario Kart World that it felt like it was officially developed by Nintendo.\n\nAnd on that end, I have confirmation from XREAL that the ROG XREAL R1 glasses are compatible with the XREAL Neo mobile dock and battery pack. This is much more compact than the dock that comes with the headset, and, if you plug the glasses and the Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 into it at the same time, it will allow you to play your Nintendo console in AR. Even Asus' dock can't do that without another Switch dock acting as an intermediary first. Plus, this will charge whatever device you're playing at the same time.\n\nThe ROG XREAL R1 AR glasses will release later this year, although pricing isn't available quite yet. They're expected to release in the first half of this year.",

It's a statement but still not what we want. We're on a journey. It's about the next game on Sunday.\n\n\"When I took over two years ago at Sheffield Wednesday, we were 12, 13 points under the line.

That being said, you'll need to extract with the Magnetron and Flow Controller items once you find them, so it's probably best to bring in an augment that has a safe pocket or two to ensure you don't accidentally lose these precious items if you find them during your raid.",

For Harry Potter fans, Hogwarts Legacy is one of the best RPGs on the market, and it's largely based on lore from the Wizarding World. So, while it's difficult to get that same exact experience if you're looking to be in the world of Harry Potter, you can find similar gameplay elements and deep lore-rich stories in other games.\nBelow, we'll be listing 17 games that feature some sort of similarity to Hogwarts Legacy. That similarity could come in the form of one specific gameplay feature or an all-encompassing experience that gives you the same thrills as you had when walking the halls of Hogwarts.",

For Harry Potter fans, Hogwarts Legacy is one of the best RPGs on the market, and it's largely based on lore from the Wizarding World. So, while it's difficult to get that same exact experience if you're looking to be in the world of Harry Potter, you can find similar gameplay elements and deep lore-rich stories in other games.\n\nBelow, we'll be listing 17 games that feature some sort of similarity to Hogwarts Legacy. That similarity could come in the form of one specific gameplay feature or an all-encompassing experience that gives you the same thrills as you had when walking the halls of Hogwarts. If you haven't had a chance to pick up Hogwarts Legacy yet, it is available on Nintendo Switch 2.\n\nHogwarts Legacy was embroiled in controversy due to transphobic remarks from Harry Potter author JK Rowling. Although she was not personally involved with its development, she stands to profit from its success. For more, read our in-depth article on how Rowling's comments have impacted the trans community.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was one of the more important RPGs ever made due to its revolutionary open world map and quest design, two core pillars of Hogwarts Legacy. While you can still play the original, Oblivion Remastered is a better product in almost every single way. The 2006 masterpiece has been completely remastered, featuring overhauled graphics, character models, dialogue, and mechanics. The core game is still intact, though, as you start your adventure on an epic quest to uncover the mystery of why your emperor was murdered.\n\nAlong the way, you'll encounter five distinct guilds, each with its own questlines, several sprawling cities teeming with life, and an open world that features dozens of unique locations. Also, if you're a fan of the magical combat in Hogwarts Legacy, Oblivion Remastered lets you become a full-blown mage who can use a variety of different magic attacks. It doesn't officially support them, but a collection of Oblivion Remastered mods have also begun to pop up that can further improve the experience.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nImmortals Fenyx Rising is an action-adventure game in the mold of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild that places a large emphasis on combat, but still has many qualities that appeal to Hogwarts Legacy fans. You'll get to explore the world right from the start of the game, and when you're not fighting enemies, you can solve a number of challenging puzzles that lead to rewards or other areas within the world. As for combat, you'll get to challenge mythological beasts such as Medusa as well as a plethora of other smaller enemies. The combat in Immortals Fenyx Rising is quite faster than in Hogwarts Legacy, but it's easy to pick up once you understand the controls.\n\nIf the lore and story were your favorite parts about Hogwarts Legacy, then why not hop over to another beloved pop culture franchise? Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is an original story in the Star Wars universe that takes place between the events of the prequel trilogy and the new trilogy movies. It's a sequel to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, but you don't need to play that game to understand what's happening in Survivor.\n\nThe game continues to follow protagonist Cal Kestis as he attempts to lead a rebellion against the Empire with a band of outlaws. Survivor sees you visit several planets that are somewhat open world and all have different enemies to face, puzzles to solve, and collectibles to find. As you progress, you'll unlock more attack types, including additional Force abilities and lightsaber forms. The combat in Survivor can be fairly difficult, especially against the late-game bosses, but you have plenty of tools at your disposal to take down enemies. For newer video game players, you can simply set the difficulty level to its lowest setting and take in one of the best Star Wars tales told in recent memory.\n\nLA Noire might not be the first game you think of when you think of Hogwarts Legacy. However, the two games have \n\nIf you enjoyed the outskirt areas of Hogwarts Legacy that extended beyond the castle grounds, then Ghost of Tsushima might be right up your alley. This open-world RPG is set in 13th-century Japan during the Mongol invasion and features extremely detailed and beautiful landscapes outside of the war-torn towns and fields. Ghost of Tsushima sees you play as a samurai who's trying to navigate the invasion and protect their island from the Mongols. When you're not actively doing story missions, you can explore a huge world filled with real-life locations that are still standing in Japan today. You'll come across your fair share of enemies while exploring, but the combat in Ghosts of Tsushima is beginner-friendly while still being difficult to master as you unlock more weapons and skills. A sequel, Ghost of Yotei, is on the way in 2025.\n\nThe Horizon series features perhaps the closest games to Hogwarts Legacy. The first game in the series is Horizon Zero Dawn, but you can also play its sequel, Horizon Forbidden West, for an equally thrilling adventure. We recommend playing Zero Dawn first, though, as there's so much lore you need to understand before you can fully appreciate Forbidden West.\n\nIn Horizon Zero Dawn, you play as Aloy, an orphan born in the midst of a post-apocalyptic period in an alternate version of the United States in the 31st century. In this version of the US, man-made machines have taken over the planet, and tribes of hunter-gatherers and warriors try to survive without antagonizing them. Throughout Zero Dawn, you'll uncover the origins of Aloy's story, which is deeply entangled with how this future came to be and what happened to the humans before the machines took over. It's an epic adventure with a huge open world, combat centered around a bow and arrow, and plenty of secrets to discover.\n\nThe Dragon Age franchise is one that Hogwarts Legacy fans should find enjoyable. They're RPGs with an emphasis on narrative elements and exploration through a large, open world. There's also plenty of magic at play, both in combat and with basic mechanics. In The Veilguard, you play as Rook, who's tasked with stopping a pair of corrupt gods who have escaped their imprisonment. At the beginning of the game, you'll be by yourself, but over time, you can recruit a number of companions to join your party and fight alongside you for the duration of the adventure. Magic, an open world, and a mysterious story all make Dragon Age: The Veilguard an enticing option for any Hogwarts fan. You also don't have to play any of the original Dragon Age games to understand the story, so feel free to hop right in regardless of your experience.\n\nSpeaking of a franchise with some deep lore, the Marvel universe is a natural stepping stone for any Hogwarts Legacy player to dive into. While some fantastic Marvel games have been released in the past several years, Spider-Man was the game that marked Marvel's revival in the video game industry. This is an original story for the webbed hero that follows Peter Parker trying to navigate a day job while also being a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. The story starts off relatively slow, but develops into a thriller with all sorts of twists and turns.\n\nThe setting for Marvel's Spider-Man is an open-world New York City, and swinging through its skyscrapers or Central Park is one of the best feelings you can experience in a video game. The swinging mechanics along with the Arkham-style combat are thoroughly crisp, leading you to feel like you really are Spider-Man.\n\nIf puzzles were one of your favorite parts of Hogwarts Legacy, but you still want some exploration, then look no further than The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Breath of the Wild is one of the most celebrated video games of all time, combining a staggeringly massive open world with fantastic puzzles that actually require you to use different parts of your console to solve. Some puzzles can simply be solved using the joysticks on your Switch, while others use the console's gyro controls and both Joy-Cons. The puzzles can be surprisingly difficult to get through, but they might not even be the hardest part of the game.\n\nInstead, the combat and gear degradation systems in Breath of the Wild will likely have you more challenged than the puzzles. Combat can be difficult if you run into a boss or enemy that outlevels you, but even easy fights have the potential to turn difficult if your favorite sword breaks from too much use. While all of this sounds overly challenging, Breath of the Wild allows you to play at your own pace, and players of all skill levels can pick it up and immediately enjoy what it has to offer. An enhanced Switch 2 Edition of Breath of the Wild and its excellent sequel, Tears of the Kingdom, are out now and boast some very nice upgrades.\n\nNow, your first thought when you see a game like Baldur's Gate 3 might be that you're not a fan of turn-based combat. After all, if you liked Hogwarts Legacy, going from fast-paced wand fights to slow, turn-based moves in every encounter could be jarring. However, if you can get past the shift to turn-based combat and really sink your teeth into Baldur's Gate 3, you'll discover why it's considered one of the best RPGs ever made.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 is an epic tale of your character, who can either be a preset character or completely your design, trying to stop an alien force from taking over an entire continent's minds. The game isn't necessarily open world, as it features distinct zones that are a part of the different story acts, but the zones themselves are very large. Within these zones, you'll be able to pick up new party members, who you can completely control, go on winding side quests that feel like their own mini-story, and explore the beautiful and dangerous landscapes that make up each one of the maps. Baldur's Gate 3 also features cross-play and is fully co-op, so you can partake in the adventure with a friend or two.\n\nThe Assassin's Creed franchise is somewhat divisive, as many fans seem to either love or hate the different styles of games in the series. If you were to pick one to play to scratch your Hogwarts Legacy itch, though, make it Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Set in 400 BC Greece, Odyssey sees you take control of either a male or female protagonist who comes from humble beginnings. However, over the course of the game, you'll take part in a war between Athens and Sparta, command a ship across high seas, and explore perhaps the biggest open-world map on this list. The story in Odyssey has a few different branches that all clash by the end of the 50-hour-plus campaign, and it's one of the most memorable in the Assassin's Creed franchise. Hogwarts Legacy fans should find the combat easy to pick up, and exploration on a much larger scale than they find in the Wizarding World.\n\nFable III is one of the few games on this list that's somewhat difficult to play in 2025. However, if you're subscribed to Game Pass, then you shouldn't have any trouble on Xbox or PC. Fable III is the most recent game in the Fable series, but the next entry, currently known simply as Fable, is coming sometime in 2026. The Fable series is widely beloved in the gaming community thanks to the charm of its characters and gameplay. Fable III specifically sees you embark on a quest to take down an unruly leader and manage the kingdom for the people of your country.\n\nWhile the story in Fable III isn't especially long, it does offer you a plethora of choices to make that drastically impact how the narrative plays out. During your adventure in the main story, you'll come across a slew of combat engagements, which play out in real time and feature melee, ranged, and magic attacks. The combat can be a little clunky in Fable III, but the world and characters will keep you enthralled throughout the entire game.\n\nIf we're recommending games like Hogwarts Legacy, let's go with one of the only other Wizarding World titles on the market that's easily playable in 2025. Lego Harry Potter: Years 1-4 allows you to play through the first four years of the Harry Potter series as Harry himself. You'll get to explore a slimmed-down version of Hogwarts Castle and meet the cast of characters that you know and love. The game doesn't play out exactly like the movies or books, so there will be some different events that take place. Of course, you'll still get to partake in the classic Harry Potter events, such as playing Quidditch, sneaking around after dark, and even battling the Basilisk. Given the Lego nature of these games, they're meant to appeal to a more casual gaming audience, but any Harry Potter fan should find something to enjoy in Years 1-4.\n\nLife is Strange is strictly a game for Hogwarts Legacy players who value the story above anything else. Life is Strange doesn't feature any sort of combat or an open-world map to explore. Instead, the game takes place over a series of episodes that follow Max Caulfield, a high school senior who discovers that she can rewind time. Using this ability, Max tries to save her best friend, but altering the past can come with severe consequences. Your job is to find a way to navigate the pitfalls of time travel to try and get as happy an ending as possible. The story is gripping throughout every episode of Life is Strange, and there is some puzzle-solving along the way.\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the most well-reviewed games ever and easily a top 10 RPG of all time. If the lore and world of Hogwarts Legacy are something that appeals to you, there's arguably no better game to turn to than The Witcher 3. Don't be intimidated by the \"3\" in the title, as it helps to know the lore of the first two games, but it's not imperative whatsoever.\n\nThe Witcher 3 sees you take control of Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter who possesses unnatural abilities and strengths. Geralt begins the game on the hunt for his adopted daughter, Ciri, as he's having dreams of an undead army called \"The Wild Hunt\" coming for him and Ciri. While this is the premise of the game, The Witcher 3 is so much more than its initial plotline. The game takes you across an incredibly detailed and large open world where quests and new locations are waiting around every corner. The Witcher 3 even features its own card-based minigame, Gwent, which is now a full-fledged game in its own right.\n\nThe Tomb Raider reboot in 2013 kicked off one of the best gaming trilogies of the modern era. Consisting of Tomb Raider, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider, these games are extremely well-done and provide you with a very similar experience to that of Hogwarts Legacy. You play as Lara Croft, a world explorer who comes from a wealthy family but finds herself constantly embroiled in some controversies with rival explorers. The Tomb Raider games offer fast-paced and stealthy combat, where you can use a variety of weapons, but you'll also be tasked with solving puzzles, or \"tombs,\" as you progress through the story. With a solid mix of combat, storytelling, and puzzles, you should find yourself right at home as a Hogwarts Legacy fan.\n\nIf you want to step into another established franchise with a cast of iconic characters and villains, then look no further than the Batman Arkham trilogy. Consisting of Batman Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight, these games revolutionized an entire generation of action-adventure and RPG titles with their \"Arkham-style\" combat. Naturally, you play as Batman in these games, and each title offers a new story for the Caped Crusader. The stories often revolve around the villains of the game, and the second and third titles allow you to explore an open-world Gotham City. While there's crime around every corner in Gotham, there are also puzzles you can solve that are doled out by none other than The Riddler. There's a slice of gameplay for all Hogwarts Legacy fans, but the Arkham games lean more on the side of combat than puzzles.",

    "description": ": Workers face new mental health pressures as they shift from doing tasks to babysitting agentic AI",
    "fullText": "A report on occupational health warns that AI adoption may paradoxically increase workplace burdens rather than reduce them. As AI automates routine tasks, workers will shoulder new responsibilities: overseeing AI systems, catching their errors, and managing the resulting complexity – potentially triggering mental health pressures.\n\nResearchers from Imperial College London and Microsoft argue the real impact won't be mass job replacement, but a fundamental shift in work demands. Human roles will evolve from performing tasks to stewarding AI agents across workflows, including briefing them, reviewing outputs, and correcting errors.\n\n\"As AI absorbs routine tasks, human roles may shift toward stewardship, problem-solving, or emotional labor, all with their own psychological demands,\" said Dr Lara Shemtob, who led the research published in the Society of Occupational Medicine's (SOM) journal Occupational Medicine.\n\nThis effectively transforms workers into managers of AI systems – a role not everyone is suited for. The report warns AI may \"paradoxically increase the knowledge worker's burden of handling complex tasks while simultaneously exerting downward pressure on compensation.\" This means more responsibility and less pay, because AI supposedly makes work \"easier.\"\n\nAll of this could introduce novel occupational hazards, some familiar in form but different in scale and complexity, raising stress levels.\n\nEvidence already supports this concern. A 2024 study found AI coding tools actually slowed developers down due to time spent checking and correcting AI-generated errors. As AI systems become more autonomous, problems like \"hallucinations\" (false or inaccurate outputs) may escalate and become harder to detect.\n\nUntil now, much of the debate over AI has centred on the extent to which it will (or maybe won't) replace people's jobs.\n\nThe report urges quantifying AI supervision demands and building them into job descriptions to avoid hidden workloads that negate automation benefits.\n\nResearchers don't yet know the exact impact on human employees from having to work more closely with AI, the report concludes, but they say occupational health should be part of the dialog and analysis of how AI changes expectations of workers.\n\nWhether this scenario materializes remains uncertain. Recent reports show companies have invested tens of billions in generative AI with little return, and many projects fail due to underestimated deployment complexity.\n\nThe question isn't just how AI will change work, it's whether widespread adoption will happen at all. ®",

This community has taken it upon themselves to create thousands of mods for Ark, and some of these improve the game in ways that fans would have never expected. From adding entirely new maps to creating more dangerous and unique dinosaurs to making your life easier with quality-of-life changes, the best Ark mods can fundamentally alter how you play the game.\n\nDown below, you’ll find the top mods that Ark has to offer. These are all searchable and downloadable via the game's Steam Workshop section. The modding community for Ark began on Steam and never migrated over to Nexus Mods, which is a shift from how many other survival games handle mods. However, with the mods being directly on Steam, this should make it simpler for you to download your favorite mods and immediately boot them up in Ark.\n\nStructures Plus is a gigantic mod that's completely centered around building in Ark. A bulk of the mod focuses on quality of life fixes and changes for building mode to make your life much easier. However, the best part about Structures Plus is the ability to snap your structures into place, so there's no more guessing where they might fit. You'll also see new materials included with the mod to spice up base life and give you more objects to build and play around with.\n\nOne of the more tedious aspects of Ark is having to travel everywhere. While you do get access to dinosaurs, both on the ground and in the air, being able to quickly travel somewhere is a benefit many Ark players wish they had. Well, it's no longer a wish with the Awesome Teleporters mod. This mod adds three new items into the game, and one of them is a teleporter that you can place anywhere on the map in whatever quantity you want. You can then quickly teleport to the locations you've placed them at. The mod also adds another teleport that transports you to a public teleporter on the map and a Dino Tracker, which allows you to teleport directly to a dino you're currently tracking.\n\nThere are very few worse things than dying in Ark, as you usually tend to lose whatever you had in your inventory. However, with the Death Recovery Mod, that won't happen ever again. The mod adds a personal gravestone to a set location of your choosing. If you die, you can return to this gravestone to retrieve any items that you lost upon death. You can basically place this gravestone down near your bed or respawn point so that when you die, you'll immediately be able to get your items and go on like nothing happened.\n\nWhile capturing all sorts of different dinosaurs and seeing them roam out in the wilderness is one of the best parts about Ark, it can also make dinosaur management a real hassle. Fortunately, with the Dino Storage v2 mod, you can safely and quickly store your captured dinosaurs in a safe place. This mod is basically like the PC system in Pokémon or a personal chest in Minecraft. Once you capture a dinosaur, you can choose to store it in the Dino Storage box until you're ready to take it back out. This allows you to easily track the dinosaurs you've caught and saves a ton of space on your part of the island in Ark.\n\nThe Upgrade Station mod allows you to fully improve the quality of any item in Ark. You can upgrade your gear, weapons, and tools from their most basic form all the way to the highest level possible (Ascendant). You can even upgrade the TEK armor set and items that have been modded into Ark. This means both your vanilla and modded weapons and armor can be upgraded using the new Upgrade Station that you can easily place at your base. You're even able to quickly salvage items at the station, giving you more resources to upgrade your gear.\n\nA tedious, but necessary, part of the progression in Ark is dealing with Engrams. You need them to access more advanced content throughout the game, but working through the system can be overwhelming and time-consuming. Luckily, the Auto Engrams mod aims to make the system more automatic and less taxing on the player. The mod automatically unlocks Engrams every time you level up and ignores the point restrictions on Engrams. This means you'll be able to take advantage of new Engrams without having to manually unlock them yourself.\n\nHunting normal dinosaurs is always an adrenaline rush in Ark, but what if there were a way to up the ante? The Improved Dinos mod adds rarer dinos into the game and gives them the ability to roam across a vast area, so there's some legwork when it comes to hunting them. If you manage to kill one of these rare dinosaurs, you're guaranteed to receive some rare blueprints that otherwise would have taken you hours to get from hunting other dinos across the island. The mod adds three dinos, with each one having unique traits: Raptor Elite, Alpha Dilo, and Obsidian Carno. You can read about their traits on the mod's Steam Workshop page.\n\nPrimal Fears is one of the biggest mods to come to Ark, and it adds hours of specifically-designed PvE content to the game. The mod adds different tameable tiers for every dinosaur in the game, as well as boss dinos that are incredibly difficult to kill. Each tameable tier of a dinosaur makes it more challenging to capture, and the tiers come with different challenges you'll have to overcome. In addition to all of that, Primal Fears also places brand new items into the game that aid players in capturing or killing the new dinosaurs. You can see more about the new dinos and items on the mod's Workshop page.\n\nThe normal SpyGlass in Ark certainly has its uses, but the Awesome SpyGlass mod makes it seem irrelevant. This mod turns your vanilla SpyGlass into a beacon of information, allowing you to point it at anything and receive a slew of details about whatever you're targeting. This includes dinos, eggs, supply crates, and just about anything else you can find on your island. You can also customize the SpyGlass with a variety of options that are available right from the mod's menu in-game.\n\nIf you've played Pokémon or even Palworld, then you probably know about the Shiny forms of creatures in those games. Well, the Shiny! Dinos mod brings that mechanic to Ark, giving you extremely rare and differently-colored dinos to track and tame. Dinos with different colors possess special abilities that you can harness if they're tamed, but they can also be killed to receive some unique rewards. These Shiny dinos have the chance to be a beefed-up version of themselves as well, so don't be surprised if you run into an Aberrant or X variant.\n\nThe taming system in the vanilla version of Ark is certainly in-depth, but it can get old after a while. We do have some mods on this list that help improve the taming system, but none are as advanced as the Immersive Taming mod. This mod adds a slew of new taming methods to the game, including giving certain dinos new food, protecting the dino, attacking a dino's target, caring for them, and more. There's also a trust meter with each dino you tame, allowing you to build real bonds with the dinos you capture. This also plays a factor in how hostile dinos act towards you, so the mod really changes up your gameplay when it comes to dino interactions.\n\nVanilla Ark features a degradable gear system that forces you to constantly replenish certain tools and weapons in your inventory after they've been used enough. While this adds to the difficulty of Ark, sometimes you just don't want to worry about an item degrading. Fortunately, the Reusable Plus mod does exactly that, making it so a number of items no longer degrade after they've been created. This includes the grappling hook, spear, parachute, flare gun, and bola.\n\nIf you're playing Ark just for the vibes, the dinos, and the exploration, then you might want a way to make your day-to-day life a little easier. The Simpler Spawners mod aims to give you that easier life. The mod makes it so you can immediately spawn in any creature, resource, nest, or crate wherever you want. While some of the spawns do require you to exchange something else, you can pretty much spawn in whatever you want at any time. This allows you to fully customize your base as well as the entire map. Create a new biome, diversify other areas, and expand your base to be as big as your imagination allows for.\n\nMap mods have become extremely popular in the Ark community over the years. Perhaps the most infamous map mod of them all is the Dome of Death, which spawns you in on a terrifyingly difficult map. The Dome of Death is a small island map that locks you in with some of the most dangerous creatures Ark has to offer. Your goal in the dome is to find valuables that are scattered around the map, but there are creatures guarding them with their lives. You can't enter the dome with any tamed creatures by your side, so it's just you against nature.\n\nThe Auto Torch mod is all about adding some automation to your Ark life. The mod allows you to place timers on all light sources in the game and makes it so they no longer require any fuel. Basically, you're adding the ability to turn lights on and off whenever you want without having to manually go to each light source every day. You can also add some unique colors to the light sources by adding specific resources to them.\n\nDespite the name of this mod, it doesn't actually add any sort of bird creatures into Ark. Instead, what it does is optimize a variety of the game's elements and adds a slew of new creatures for you to kill, capture, or tame. The mod mostly accomplishes this by combining two other very popular mods, the Saurophaganax Mod and the Giant Spino Mod.\n\nWeapons are never in short supply when you're playing Ark, but the Primal Blades mod adds in three highly unique katanas that you can add to your inventory. The mod also adds extra dinos to the game, which drop the special crafting resources you need to create the three individual katanas. However, before the resources drop, you'll have to defeat waves of dinos, so there's much more depth to this mod than simply adding in a few new weapons that you can use.",

If you're more interested in RPGs as a whole, you can check out our list of the best RPGs to play in 2025, or refresh your Fallout experience with the best Fallout 4 mods.\n\nIf you're looking for a game similar to Fallout 4, why not play the RPG by the same developer that preceded it by three years? Skyrim is one of the best-selling RPGs of all time and features plenty of the same gameplay elements and mechanics as the Fallout franchise does. You're given a massive map to explore right from the start, there are several factions to join and complete quests for, and the story can take several twists and turns depending on your choices. Skyrim might be a fantasy game without any guns or grenades, but it still has that classic Bethesda RPG feel to it that's so prevalent in Fallout 4.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nWhile Fallout 4 isn't necessarily considered a scary game, there are some parts that can make you jump in your seat a smidge. If you're looking for more of that feeling, then Metro Exodus is the next post-apocalyptic world you want to dive into. Metro Exodus is a first-person shooter that's set in 2023's Russia after a series of devastating nuclear attacks all across the planet. You play as Artyom, a survivor who's trying to establish contact with other survivors, while also trying not to get killed by the newly formed creatures and harsh environment of the Russian wilderness. Metro Exodus features large, open zones, a story that spans one year through different events, and superb, realistic gunplay. The game can be seen as more of a survival/horror experience, but it still has the FPS and open-world elements that all Fallout fans know and love.\n\nAtomfall is a game that takes clear inspiration from the Fallout franchise. It's a first-person shooter set in a post-apocalyptic world where certain technologies have advanced far beyond what we have today. While the start of the game feels like Fallout, as you continue to play through Atomfall, it becomes clear that it has put several different spins on the experience.\n\nFor starters, Atomfall is a survival game that forces you to manage your hunger, thirst, stamina, and health at all times across a map with several large, open zones. Where Atomfall really shines is in its quest design and storytelling. The game offers you several different quest lines to reach the end credits, and you need to decide which quests to complete to achieve the ending that you think is the best.\n\nWe have another Bethesda RPG, and this time it's the game that Bethesda director Todd Howard referred to as \"Fallout in space.\" Starfield captures that Bethesda Fallout feeling across nearly all facets of the game. There's smooth gunplay, booming and interactive cities, several factions that offer complete questlines, and a story that forces you to explore all across a galaxy of planets.\n\nStarfield also offers you the ability to build a base on any planet you want, which is one of the best parts about Fallout 4. In addition to the base building, Starfield also lets you customize your own spaceship. You can deck out your craft with all sorts of different parts that offer pros and cons for exploration, combat, and aesthetics.\n\nIf Starfield is referred to as \"Skyrim, but in space,\" then The Outer Worlds franchise could be referred to as \"Fallout 4, but in space.\" The Outer Worlds isn't developed by Bethesda, but it is developed by Obsidian Entertainment, the studio behind Fallout: New Vegas. In late 2025, we got The Outer Worlds 2, a sequel to the original game that built a terrific world in a faraway and futuristic galaxy. The Outer Worlds 2 builds on its predecessor while keeping the charm of its characters, rewarding loot system, and fantastic map design. The game allows you to take command of a spaceship, recruit a cast of misfits, and make choices that impact the story and world around you as you solve a conspiracy that will have ramifications on the entire galaxy.\n\nMad Max is arguably one of the most underrated games of the last decade. It features an original story set in the post-apocalyptic world of the film franchise, and, as you might expect, places a large emphasis on vehicles and trying to survive the arid climate of the wasteland. You play as Max, who starts the game barely coming out alive after a conflict with the primary antagonist, Scabrous Scrotus. Scrotus takes Max's prized vehicle, the Magnum Opus, and you spend the entire game trying to retrieve the car from his clutches.\n\nMad Max features a huge open world that you'll traverse with different vehicles you acquire throughout your adventure. You can take down enemy camps, run dangerous quests for different characters, and participate in Death Run races to earn special rewards.\n\nDying Light 2 Stay Human is a game that can be seen as one of the closest experiences to Fallout 4 on this list. Of course, that's if Fallout 4 had parkour, slick movement abilities, and zombies instead of ghouls. The main gameplay element that Dying Light 2 focuses on is its parkour, which affects map traversal in almost every single way. You have access to a huge, post-apocalyptic city, and the entire map is set up for parkour moves and abilities. You also need these parkour elements to escape the hundreds of ravenous zombies that only come out during Dying Light 2's frightening nights.\n\nFallout 4 is set in a post-apocalyptic version of Boston, where nuclear war has ravaged the landscape. While Cyberpunk 2077 doesn't feature a post-apocalyptic world, it does feature an alternate version of San Diego that's set 50 years in the future.\n\nWhile the setting of Cyberpunk 2077 is certainly fascinating, it's the backdrop to one of the best RPG experiences on the market. Cyberpunk 2077 offers a highly interactive and content-filled open world that's dazzling to look at, regardless of where you are. The game offers you multiple ways to engage in combat, and you can enhance your preferred playstyle with unlockable skills and craft technological mods to upgrade your character.\n\nThe Last of Us only shares one or two aspects with Fallout 4, but it's still a game that's absolutely worth playing. It begins with a zombie-style outbreak and fast-forwards several years to a post-apocalyptic future. While The Last of Us uses a third-person perspective and features linear gameplay, it also tells one of the most gripping tales in video game history, which has since been turned into a major TV series on HBO. It might not be an open-world RPG like Fallout 4, but the world and story are all the reasons you need to pick it up.\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn takes the post-apocalypse theme and turns it upside down, as the game takes place more than 1,000 years into the future. During this 1,000-year period, man-made machines have taken over the planet after their AI went rogue during humanity's peak in the 21st century. Horizon Zero Dawn offers a huge open world to explore, hours and hours of lore to listen to and read, and engaging combat that mixes in archery, traps, and melee weapons. If you enjoyed Fallout 4 for the design of the Commonwealth or the mystery behind the story, Horizon Zero Dawn is a perfect game to play next.\n\nThe Division 2 is an online tactical shooter that takes place in the war-torn downtown district of Washington, D.C. after a viral outbreak has brought the nation to its knees. Your objective in The Division 2 is to fend off enemy factions trying to take control of the city. To do that, you and a group of real players need to work together to scavenge loot and supplies across an open map that's split up into zones. You can encounter both AI enemies and other players, but some areas are solely designated for PvP fights. The Division 2 features some elements of an RPG, but it's a multiplayer game at its core that requires you to improve your skills and gear, unless you want an enemy team to bulldoze through you.\n\nBioShock might be one of the older titles on this list, but few games can match the overall immersion that it brings to the table. It's set in the underwater city of Rapture, which was created by a man named Andrew Ryan to escape the ever-changing world above the surface. Through the course of the game, you'll explore every inch of the now-ruined city. Along your way, you can attain new powers and abilities, discover secrets about Rapture and its downfall, and fight off some of the most iconic enemies in video game history. BioShock might not have the freedom of Fallout 4, but it has the exact kind of vibe that you want as a fan of the game.\n\nWe're back with another RPG from Obsidian Entertainment. This time it's the studio's most recent entry, Avowed, which is set in a fictional fantasy land that's engulfed in conflict and intrigue. Avowed features four different large open zones that are almost big enough to be their own open world maps. These zones hold dozens of quests to complete, collectibles to find, and hidden locations that could alter how the story plays out if you find them early enough. Perhaps the best part of Avowed is its combat system and skills menu, which allow you to fight enemies using smooth gunplay, crisp melee weapons, or long-range magic spells or guns. It's a fantastic game from top to bottom that feels like a blend of both Fallout and Skyrim.\n\nWhile you might not initially think Borderlands is a lot like Fallout, the franchise has come a long way in the RPG genre. Borderlands 4, the most recent installment, features a large open world that you can explore as you progress the story. Unlike previous games, there are no loading zones between separate maps, so the entire thing is seamless. You also get to interact with a variety of characters, some of whom act as companions, and take on a plethora of side quests and other objectives throughout the world. The looting aspect of Borderlands 4 is different from Fallout, and the gameplay is much faster-paced, but both are terrific RPGs with large worlds to uncover.\n\nProject Zomboid is a survival sandbox game that's unlike many of the single-player experiences included on this list. What might make Project Zomboid enjoyable for a Fallout 4 fan is the open-world exploration and expansive base building elements. The game forces you to deal with swarms of zombies all across the open map, and to fend them off, you need to scrounge for resources that you can use to craft weapons, gear, and other items at your base. While the base-building in Project Zomboid is quite different from Fallout 4, you can make immensely large bases that allow you to sustain yourself in the post-apocalypse.\n\nIf the exploration and story are your favorite parts of Fallout 4, then Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden is a great addition to your game library. The game is set in a post-human version of Earth where different creatures have risen up to dominate the planet. You control a party of these creatures and can explore a slew of unique environments that all present different challenges. At the heart of Mutant Year Zero is turn-based combat, which is akin to something like XCOM. The combat might throw off FPS fans at first, but after you get used to it, you'll be engaged and start strategizing various ways to win fights by controlling your entire party of mutants.\n\nThe Warhammer 40000 franchise is known for its narrative-driven gameplay and engaging RPGs. Rogue Trader is another RPG that centers around turn-based combat and assembling a party of different characters for you to control. You can recruit a plethora of characters to join you, and each of them have various attacking styles, weapons, and abilities. When you're not in combat, you can explore a large world where the story plays a major role in everything you do. The choices you make throughout the story affect what happens later in the game and your eventual ending. It's an excellent RPG that blends the exploration and narrative parts of Fallout 4 with strategic, turn-based combat.\n\nWe've already mentioned The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, but pound for pound, its predecessor, Oblivion, might be the better overall RPG. While you can still go back and play the original, Bethesda released a fully remastered version of Oblivion at the start of 2025. The remaster is done wonderfully, as bugs have been fixed, graphics have been improved, and quality-of-life updates are live, including the ability to sprint. At its core, though, Oblivion Remastered is the same premier RPG that showcases Bethesda at its best in terms of gameplay design and world-building.",

    "fullText": "and \n Joey Carr\n on January 6, 2026 at 11:58AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nSometimes, it's nice to sit down on a quiet day and figure out a puzzle. Crosswords, jumbles, and other word-based puzzle games have appeared in newspapers for dozens of years, and the evolution of that premise--the puzzle video game--has created the same sort of brain-teasing brilliance on our TV screens.\n\nBelow are some of the best puzzle games available today: 22 games that challenge your critical-thinking skills in ways other games simply cannot manage. Some of these are newer games--including one indie darling that's recently taken the world by storm--while others have been around for quite a long time. Puzzle games offer some of the most engaging gameplay experiences in video games, and these 22 currently sit at the top of the puzzler pile.\n\nFor the best of the best in other genres, check out our rundowns of the best RPGs, best open-world games, and best racing games currently available.\n\nThe most recent puzzle game on this list has become the apple of the entire gaming industry's eye since it launched in April. Blue Prince follows a teenage boy named Simon as he tries to find a hidden 46th room in a mansion with 45 rooms--but no two visits are the same. Simon must \"draft\" a room with different properties, items, and configurations in order to reach Room 46 and complete his task, but doing so is no small task … and for every question you answer along the way, two more are asked in its place. Oh, and when you do reach Room 46 and the credits roll, well, that's when the game actually begins.\n\nIf you dig the game, be sure to check our some other great games like Blue Prince.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nThe Outer Wilds is an intriguing experiment of a game, with time serving as the central conceit--how much can you explore in only 22 real-world minutes? The unnamed spacefarer starts in the same location during each run, and after 22 minutes--or if the spacefarer should die--the cycle repeats itself. In that limited time--and across multiple runs, you'll gather clues, make discoveries, and solve the mystery of the Nomai, an extinct race that built the space stations hovering overhead. The Outer Wilds is a truly unique experience, and one with a fascinating puzzle to solve at its core.\n\nA merchant ship, lost at sea for five years, suddenly appears off the English coast, but with none of its crew aboard. As an investigator for the East India Company, it's your job to find out what happened to the crew and the Obra Dinn itself through the Memento Mortem, a pocketwatch-like item that can recreate the moment of someone's death. With it, you must solve the massive puzzle in front of you, while determining the interconnected fates of all 60 known crew members. Return of the Obra Dinn is a remarkable game, with a distinct low-resolution graphical style and a few \"a ha!\" moments that other games simply cannot replicate.\n\nTetris's classic line-clearing gameplay has been delighting players for decades now, but there's something about the way Enhance's take on the puzzler with Tetris Effect completely enhances the experience, especially in VR. Ethereal wisps flying across the screen, lights pulsing to the beat of the incredible soundtrack, and flashes of brilliant light at key moments make Tetris Effect--and its expansion, Connected--one of the best ways to play Tetris available today.\n\nIn The Talos Principle, an android solves a series of puzzles and becomes the progenitor of a new robotic civilization, after the death of humanity from global warming. Talos Principle 2 continues that story, but adds on a layer of political intrigue and tension that drives you to solve the puzzles even more. Croteam has devised some of the most thought-provoking challenges on this list, and the reward for solving them is a story rooted in real-world issues despite being told through the eyes of robots.\n\nBaba Is You is a puzzle game where you push blocks, but the blocks are words that represent certain actions. It's also a game that plays by its own rules--specifically, it allows you to change the rules as you progress, solving puzzles through the new rules you create. By shifting the words around the stage, you can fundamentally change how the world works around you, which creates some truly baffling challenges that stay with you long after you've completed them. This one has flown under the radar for most players, but those that have played Baba Is You cannot say enough about it.\n\nImagine finding an old photo book and holding one of the photos inside to your eye level, only to find that the image has somehow superimposed itself on the real-world and you can walk into it to explore. That's Viewfinder at its core, and puzzles are solved by strategically placing photos in this manner all over the world to create paths and access teleporters that take you to the next stage. It's a novel approach to the puzzle genre, as each picture warps the world in cool and interesting ways that it's always surprising to see how things turn out.\n\nRemaking one of the best puzzle games in the world is no small task, but Cyan did an incredible job bringing Riven--the sequel to the massively influential PC puzzler Myst--into the modern age with the 2023 remake. Riven is a sprawling adventure in the mystical world of D'Ni, where an ancient race hides its secret behind massive, mind-bending puzzles. Nothing about what made Riven so magical in the first place--from the unique puzzles to the always-foreboding atmosphere--is lost in translation through Riven's modernization, and the result is the new best way to relive this absolute classic.\n\nSpeaking of Myst, The Witness plays a lot like the early-'90s classic--you're thrown into a mysterious island, filled with puzzles littering the entire landscape, and the more progress you make, the more you learn about the world around you. This is also one for the completionists; though it's not required to finish the game's story, there are 650 puzzles scattered around The Witness's world. See if you can solve them all.\n\nBotany Manor might be the most \"zen\" game on this list, as its go-at-your-own-pace structure and relaxing vibes make it a great way to find some calm at the end of the day. The point-and-click game tasks you with growing magical flowers, called Forgotten Flora, and you must find clues on how to do so, as well as the items needed, scattered throughout the manor. Once you have the parameters for each plant, you must create the correct environment in the greenhouse, and then you'll have your Forgotten Flora. If you want to cozy up on the couch with a low-stakes game, Botany Manor fits the bill.\n\nThe original Portal bent your mind into a pretzel with its first-person, physics-based, portal-powered puzzle solving fueled by the sarcastic and sadistic AI GlaDOS, all within a tidy package that could be wrapped up in a few hours. Portal 2 ups the ante with a much longer campaign, as it also adds lasers, tractor beams, colored paints with different properties, and a new AI named Wheatley with a devious side of his own. Portal 2 is simply a classic, and a game that everyone should try for themselves at least once.\n\nA lot of the puzzle games we've seen so far use environmental aspects to challenge your mind, but none of them are centered around translating fictional languages, writing systems, and other word-based mechanics in order to more fully understand the world around them. Chants of Sennaar does this incredibly well, all while telling a tale about language barriers and their ability to separate the world around us. Chants of Sennaar was a big surprise hit when it launched in 2023, and you'll understand why the first time you boot up the game--no words required.\n\nThat The Room--which began as a mobile title over a decade ago--still ranks as one of the best puzzle games ever made should give you an idea of just how enjoyable it is. The presentation is as simple as it gets--it's a box with puzzles, and as you solve them, the larger box disappears and a smaller box is revealed--but the solutions are dastardly clever, and the accompanying letters add an interesting bit of world-building to the puzzle-solving experience. There have been many Room games released since 2012, but you never forget your first.\n\nLorelei and the Laser Eyes is the kind of puzzle game where taking notes is paramount, as the game's 150 puzzles can be solved in any order you prefer, so if you have to backtrack, you'll want to remember what you've done. It's also the kind of puzzle game that will make you want to solve \"one more puzzle\" to learn more about what's going on in this weird house and who's behind it all. A puzzle game and an interesting mystery? Say no more.\n\nA stream of humans are walking down a path, and you have to lead them to a specific destination. What better way to do this than with a cute little doggo made of light? You'll assign certain actions to humans in the mob as you progress, with strategically placed actions being essential to the overall goal of getting these people where they're going. Humanity hearkens back to the days of Lemmings in a fun and interesting way, and best of all, cute little doggo!\n\n\"MATCH DNA BUBBLES IN AN UNDERGROUND LAB TO KEEP YOUR PSYCHIC CLONE FROM INVADING YOUR MIND AND TURNING YOU INTO A CANNIBAL.\" That's the game's official description on its Steam page, and frankly it sets the tone pretty well. Battling the many dinos and rednecks in the creepy mansion is done through a match-3 puzzle system, and the wacky enemies keep a smile on your face while you're doing it. The story is a commentary on video games as a whole too, which explains the \"3\" in the title--don't go looking for Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 1 or 2 … they don't actually exist.\n\nRise of the Golden Idol couples stellar storytelling with a simple point-and-click system, where finding names, actions, and other important terms through investigation allows you to (literally) fill in the blanks on what's going down in the scene in front of you. The overarching story has a lot of interesting twists and turns, and you'll never actually know what's coming next, but that's part of the fun. Color Gray Games has a true hit on their hands with the Golden Idol series.\n\nPuzzle Quest 2 frames a high fantasy story with elves, orcs, and magic within a match-3 format, and it was a big inspiration to similar games that followed--like the previously mentioned Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3. Each colored gem holds a specific attribute when matched--red, for example, increases the chance of a critical hit on the next attack--and your abilities rely on the class you choose at the beginning of the game--Barbarian, Sorcerer, Assassin, and Templar. There have been sequels and spin-offs, but for the peak Puzzle Quest experience, Puzzle Quest 2 is the one to check out.\n\nAnimal Well is a pixelated and atmospheric puzzle game that sees you dive down into the depths of a dark and mysterious world. You'll need to solve a variety of puzzles, interact with the environment, and deal with dozens of different creatures to find a path forward and progress to a new level. As you move along, you can place candles on the ground to light up your surroundings so you can attempt to uncover some secrets or potentially a new item to aid you in your journey. Animal Well is completely nonlinear as well, so you can explore the game at your own pace and follow whichever path you want.\n\nAntichamber is an older puzzle game, but it's one that still holds up extremely well today. It's clearly inspired by the Portal series, but it's much different from those experiences. For starters, the graphics look like they were drawn onto your screen with a pencil, which takes some time to adjust to. Once you do, you have to somehow navigate your way through mind-bending halls that all connect in some shape or fashion. You'll also encounter a number of geometric objects that don't obey the laws of physics in any way. To deal with everything in your path, you're given a matter gun that can manipulate objects and space around you, and this tool is imperative to solving the numerous puzzles that emerge as you try and explore more of the areas Antichamber offers.\n\nLingo 2 is an in-depth puzzle game that has a little something for every player. It features a wide array of different kinds of puzzles, ranging from word puzzles to geometry problems. The entire map in Lingo 2 unfolds as you explore it, and that only happens as you solve more puzzles that you come across. The game only features puzzles, so don't worry about any jump scares or tricky combat to interrupt your puzzle-solving flow.\n\nWhen it comes to traditional puzzle games, Split Fiction doesn't fall as neatly into the genre as others on this list. However, there are a large number of puzzles to solve throughout this co-op action-adventure game that should satisfy any puzzle fan's craving. Split Fiction needs to be played with another person, and with your partner, you'll enter different levels brought to life by two authors, who are the characters you control in split-screen action. The game features action-packed combat, heart-warming storytelling, and plenty of puzzles featured in both the main story and side activities. If you have someone to play with, Split Fiction will surprise you even if you don't traditionally play these types of games.",

For a few years after its release, it seemed like every major video game publisher wanted to copy Blizzard's formula (and monthly subscription-based revenue), and MMORPGs became a hot new genre.\n\nUnfortunately, few of the games that chased WoW's success found much of their own. Publishers soured on the genre before too long, resulting in a draught of new MMORPGs over the last decade when compared to other popular game genres (even if many of them, like some of the best survival games or multiplayer shooters, now borrow heavily from MMORPGs). As a result, many of the most popular games MMORPGs today are the same titles that were popular in the early-mid 2000s. Some have existed for decades and require subscriptions to play, even as others have more recently shifted to a free-to-play model.\n\nThere's never been a better time to get lost in a living, breathing online world, something only the best MMORPGs can provide. Below you'll find a list, in no particular order, of some of the top MMORPGs to play in 2026, ranging from tried-and-true classics of the genre to hybrids that combine the best of traditional fantasy-themed MMOs with elements of shooters, space exploration, and more. Some of the games below also happen to be some of the best free-to-play games available.\n\nBlizzard might not have invented the MMORPG, but it certainly popularized it, as it took a genre known for having a steep learning curve and made it more approachable than ever before with streamlined mechanics, punchy combat, instanced dungeons and raids, and its signature level of polish. As a result, WoW is still going strong today and remains one of the best PC MMORPGs to play, having received nine expansions to date (with a 10th on the way). In WoW, players choose a faction--the Alliance or the Horde--as well as a race and class, and from there embark on an adventure to defend the fantasy world of Azeroth from all manner of threats. Each of the game's 13 classes feels distinct, with multiple sub-classes to choose from, and there's an ever-expanding list of fantasy races to play as and customize.\n\nWoW celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2024, as Blizzard kicked-off a three-expansion storyline called The Worldsoul Saga with the release of the game's excellent and approachable The War Within expansion. Blizzard celebrated WoW's big anniversary by dropping some big news as well--after two decades, WoW will finally receive player housing as part of its next expansion, and in a recent preview made clear that unlike in some MMOs, housing in WoW will be available for everyone.\n\nWhile the main version of WoW has continued to evolve over the last 20 years, a large and vocal contingent of fans yearned for the early days of the MMO, before more-recent expansions forever transformed the game's world and Blizzard updated much of its visuals, gameplay, and classes. Blizzard finally listened in 2019 with the release of WoW Classic, a return to the game's earliest, pre-expansion days.\n\nWoW Classic's release proved to be a huge success, and Blizzard now offers multiple different flavors of old-school WoW all under one subscription price, one that also grants access to the modern version of WoW. Players can still check out the 2004-era version of Azeroth (which received new servers to start fresh on in November 2024 for the game's 20th anniversary), or move forward in time and play one of the game's older expansions, like 2010's Cataclysm (soon to be 2012's Mists of Pandaria). There are even seasonal servers, like the still ongoing Season of Discovery, which adds new items, raid content, and class changes to the original version of Blizzard's genre-defining title.\n\nSince the genre's inception, many MMORPGs have featured familiar sword-and-sorcery trappings. It only makes sense then that the granddaddy of the modern fantasy genre, The Lord of the Rings, was a prime candidate to get the MMO treatment following the massive success of WoW. Enter The Lord of the Rings Online, a game that couldn't have come from a more veteran MMORPG team, with developer Turbine having been responsible for MMO classics like 1999's Asheron's Call and its sequel. The Lord of the Rings Online has since changed developers, but its current developer, Standing Stone Games, is composed of many former Turbine developers. Better yet, it still receives new content updates and expansions, with its most recent, Legacy of Morgoth, having arrived in November 2024.\n\nThough very much following in the footsteps of WoW, it fittingly places a much larger emphasis on story than Blizzard's MMO and delivers a painstakingly detailed version of JRR Tolkien's Middle-earth for players to explore and immerse themselves in.\n\nFinal Fantasy is one of the biggest RPG franchises of all time, and as such has not one, but two MMORPGs to its name. Though 2002's Final Fantasy XI is still playable, it's Square Enix's more-recent MMO, Final Fantasy XIV, that has blossomed into one of the best MMORPGs of all time. When it was first released, it was a critical and commercial failure. But several years and many updates later, the game was re-released as Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, completely reworking many of the original game's systems, story, and structure. Now, Final Fantasy XIV is one of the top MMORPG games today and one of the best PS5 and Xbox MMORPGs available, having long been playable on PlayStation and more recently launching on Xbox Series X|S.\n\nIts flexible job system means players don't need to create a new character every time they want to try a new role, and despite being a MMORPG with a massive shared world to explore, its main story, over-the-top boss battles, and excellent music all deliver on what RPG fans expect from a game sharing the Final Fantasy name. Its latest expansion, Dawntrail, released in July 2024.\n\nFuncom is no stranger to MMORPGs, having previously made titles like Anarchy Online and Age of Conan. The studio's latest foray into the genre is its most ambitious yet, adapting author Frank Herbert's sci-fi Dune saga into a massive survival MMORPG where players battle to survive on the harsh desert world of Arakkis. Dune: Awakening is definitely a survival game first and foremost, with players needing to gather resources, manage their water levels, build shelter, and advance their gear to progress.\n\nHowever, MMO staples like faction reputation, class-skill trees, open-world dungeons, and a massive, ever-changing endgame PvP zone that brings together hundreds of players also firmly make Dune: Awakening a MMORPG. Its unique mix of third-person shooting, melee, and vehicular combat helps to further distinguish it from the many fantasy-themed MMOs on the market, making for an enticing combination of genres, gameplay, and aesthetics. Just keep in mind that getting killed by one of the desert's massive sandworms means losing everything on your character at that moment--the desert claims the weak.\n\nOne of the first big new MMORPGs in years, Amazon's New World made quite a splash when it released in 2021, breaking concurrent player records on Steam. The hype has since died down quite a bit, but New World is still an extremely solid MMORPG that received a major overhaul on PC and launched on consoles in the form of New World: Aeternum in October 2024. In New World: Aeternum, players wash up the mysterious island from which the game takes its name, one that has trapped various civilizations and explorers from throughout human history. From there they join one of three different factions, each with their own idea of what to do with the mystical land they now call home. Instead of classes, players instead can equip two different weapon types, which define what skills can be used and what stats a player may want to strive for when gearing their character.\n\nThe New World: Aeternum update bundled in the game's sole expansion, and in the process significantly reworked much of the game's story and its early-game questing, two of its biggest weaknesses prior to the update. Amazon also recently debuted seasonal servers that change up New World: Aeternum's normal gameplay in major ways, ranging from servers that put a heavy focus on open-world PvP to \"hardcore\" servers with faster progression where the goal is to never die even once.\n\nThe developer behind the Halo series took many of the ideas popularized in MMORPGs like WoW--dungeons, raids, classes, special abilities, color-coated loot--and applied it to a smaller-scale, sci-fi FPS. The result was Destiny and its sequel, Destiny 2. Bungie has proven it's still king when it comes to making a great-feeling shooter, and it never gets old blasting ancient aliens or genocidal robots with all manner of Destiny's 2 powerful Exotic weapons. When combined with the social elements of MMOs like shared worlds to explore, larger-scale public events, and multiplayer dungeons and raids filled with complex puzzles and mechanics, Destiny 2 forms an impressive genre cocktail that can be hard to put down.\n\nEverything Bungie has been building towards for over a decade may have culminated in 2024's The Final Shape expansion, but Destiny 2 is still receiving new updates and expansions, with the new Edge of Fate expansion releasing July 15. Destiny 2 is also widely available, making it both one of the best cross-platform games to play with friends and one of the best PS5 and Xbox MMORPG games out there.\n\nGuild Wars 2 was a breath of fresh air when it released in 2012, and for good reason. It put a new spin on many of the tried-and-true tropes and systems seen in popular MMORPGs like WoW, with an emphasis on open-world content. Combined with its flashy movement, impressive visuals compared to many other MMOs, and engaging combat that combines class skills with unique weapon abilities, Guild Wars 2 still stands out from the competition as one of the top MMORPG games available on PC.\n\nIn 2025, Guild Wars 2 is still regularly receiving new updates and expansions, in part thanks to a recent restructuring of how developer ArenaNet develops new content. Its latest expansion, Janthir Wilds, introduced several new big features, including player housing and the spear weapon-type. Unlike many of the biggest MMORPGs, Guild Wars 2 doesn't require a subscription to play, making it an appealing choice for aspiring MMO players on a budget.\n\nOne of the more popular Korean MMORPGs, Lost Ark came to the West with the help of Amazon Games and quickly set itself apart thanks to its isometric perspective and lack of a box price or mandatory subscription fee. In Lost Ark, players choose a class and then embark on a quest to discover the titular lost Arks scattered throughout the fantasy world of Arkesia. It's a journey that takes players to both huge, story-heavy new continents and to small, one-off islands that are home to some truly fun minigame events, all which players sail to on their own personal boat.\n\nSprinkle in some truly fantastic endgame raids and impressive Monster Hunter-like boss battles, and Lost Ark is well worth playing for those looking for a MMORPG that plays closer to some of the best Diablo-like games than it does WoW, albeit minus the fountains of loot. Three years later, the game is still receiving frequent updates, with a new class, the shapeshifting Wildsoul, debuting in February 2025.\n\nFallout 76 didn't exactly have a smooth start in 2018, with players criticizing it for a laundry list of bugs, performance issues, lack of NPC characters, and more. But Bethesda never gave up on its multiplayer Fallout experiment, and in 2025, Fallout 76 is a great way to experience one of gaming's best RPG universes alongside dozens of other players.\n\nLike traditional Fallout games, players scrounge their way through an apocalyptic wasteland on the hunt for supplies and gear. Unlike single-player entries in the franchise, however, dozens of players in Fallout 76 can team up to fend off waves of Super Mutants, battle massive monsters as part of the game's numerous public events, or even drop nukes on one another. Bethesda added Expeditions to the list of things to do in Fallout 76 back in 2022. These allow players to team up and venture outside the game's Appalachian Wasteland to other scenic locales, like Fallout 3's The Pitt, for dungeon-like missions, further giving the FPS RPG a distinct MMO flavor.\n\nFallout 76 has seen a resurgence in interest thanks to the launch of the TV show adaptation, making this a great time to jump in. Its most recent content update, Gone Fission, added fishing as a new activity, with players able to complete various fishing-themed quests and upgrade their fishing pole to tackle new challenges. For more on the franchise, check out our look at the best Fallout games.\n\nStar Wars: The Old Republic will feel familiar to anyone who has played WoW but is no less worthy a time investment for those looking to dive deeper into the Star Wars universe. Originally developed by BioWare, a studio known for its RPG storytelling, Star Wars: The Old Republic unsurprisingly puts its story front and center, with dialogue wheels, fully voiced characters, and impactful narrative choices that feel right at home in a single-player RPG. It also features unique storylines for each of the game's eight classes, meaning there is plenty of replay value for players who can't make up their mind on which class to play. As much as it emulates WoW in its gameplay, Star Wars: The Old Republic does include features that have yet to come to Blizzard's MMO, including player housing and NPC companions.\n\nThough the game recently changed developers (with some former members of BioWare joining Broadsword, which also oversees classic MMORPGs owned by EA like Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot), it still receives new story content and events, making it the top MMORPG game for Star Wars fans and one of the best Star Wars games of all time.\n\nWhile it may still be quite some time until The Elder Scrolls 6, those longing for a return to Tamriel will find plenty to enjoy in The Elder Scrolls Online, which celebrated its 10th anniversary last year. The MMORPG spin on Bethesda's popular RPG series will feel familiar to those who have played single-player entries in the franchise, with the ability to play in first or third-person, NPC companions, various guilds to join, options to steal from NPCs, and more. Players choose an assortment of skills both from their chosen weapon and armor type but also their class in order to make unique builds that can be used to conquer dungeons and raids with other players. Compared to other, more-traditional MMORPGs playable on consoles, its smaller number of skills and easy-to-read user interface make ESO one of the top Xbox and PS5 MMORPG games, even if it sadly doesn't support cross-play or cross-progression across platforms.\n\nIn 2025, developer ZeniMax Online is making some big changes to ESO's content schedule. It's forgoing the yearly expansion model used for almost a decade and instead focusing on smaller, more frequent seasonal updates that will help to deliver on efforts to improve the game across the board. Those efforts include major experiments like Cyrodiil Champions meant to improve the MMO's open-world PvP and a renewed focus on the new and returning player experience. Its current season, Seasons of the Worm Cult, continues the base game's main storyline, while a free update for all players in June added the ability to subclass, allowing for the mixing and matching of abilities from different classes in order to create entirely new playstyles.\n\nIt may not look like much, but Runescape, which is now in its 23rd year and comes in both its slightly-more-modern Runescape 3 form as well as Old School Runescape, is still one of the best MMORPG games of all time. It may be simple by modern standards, but there is a certain joy to be found in its point-and-click gameplay and its monotonous, yet satisfying, crafting skill grind.\n\nLike all great sandbox MMORPGs, Runescape largely leaves players to decide for themselves what interests to pursue, whether it's completing quests, mastering their crafting skills, or player-killing out in the Wilderness. It's one of the few great mobile MMORPG games available, complete with cross-play and cross-progression across platforms. Those who want to get the full Runescape experience will likely want to Jagex recently announced the first new skill in Old School Runescape history, sailing, will be added later in 2025.\n\nFor those who want a little more Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (with a large dose of anime) in their MMORPG, Tower of Fantasy is exactly what the doctor ordered. It shares plenty of DNA with the more-popular (but also largely single-player) Genshin Impact, but distinguishes itself with its shared open world, public events, co-op dungeons and a more sci-fi aesthetic. There's always something to explore, and it's easy to climb any mountain or glide to any distant spot that sparks interest. Similar to Genshin, its character-swapping action combat combined with each character's various elemental affinities keeps Tower of Fantasy's moment-to-moment gameplay interesting, especially as players earn new characters, form teams, and create new combos.\n\nThough players are more than capable of playing through its main story and many of its challenges with the game's various free characters, be warned that this is a gacha game, and many of its best characters will be inaccessible without spending large sums of money on the premium currency used to make luck-of-the-draw pulls.\n\nLike Destiny 2, Warframe isn't what many players would think of when it comes to a traditional MMORPG, but it has so many elements of the genre--shared spaces with large numbers of players, instanced dungeons and raids, high levels of customizability, crafting, guilds, etc.--that it's an MMO in all but name. Warframe has been around for over a decade, and in that time has continued to deliver best-in-class third-person-shooter gameplay alongside game-changing updates that have introduced spaceship combat, large-scale open worlds, and new story content to its sci-fi, cyber-ninja-filled universe.\n\nWith a \"Very Positive\" average user review score after over half a million reviews and counting on Steam, Warframe continues to impress, and features cross-play and cross-progression across PC, iOS, and consoles. It's also available on Nintendo Switch, making it one of the best Switch MMORPG games. A fantasy-themed successor, Soulframe, is slated to receive an open pre-alpha playtest this year.\n\nA top-down fantasy MMORPG that will look and feel familiar to Runescape fans, Albion Online takes its sandbox gameplay even further, with an almost entirely player-run economy, classless combat, and a focus on full-loot PvP with large-scale guild battles over territory. With PvP being such a large part of the endgame, and the high stakes of losing one's items when dying in PvP, Albion Online won't be for everyone.\n\nThere is PvE as well, with dungeons to explore and bosses to slay. For more farming or crafting-minded players, there is also the ability to build a home or even buy a private island and transform it into a farm, too. Few MMORPGs in the modern age truly commit to a sandbox approach like Albion Online, making it more than worth checking out, but those who have no interest in PvP or are easily frustrated by setbacks may want to look elsewhere.\n\nFor those who want to live out a superhero (or villain) fantasy instead of the sword-and-sorcery kind, there's DC Universe Online. Players can create their character, choose from a number of different powers, customize their costume, and then fight alongside iconic DC characters while exploring locations like Gotham City, Metropolis, and Arkham Asylum. DC Universe Online has been going steady for 14 years now and still receives multiple new episodic story updates for free each year. The latest episode, the Lantern Corp-focused Fearful Day, released in May\n\nAll of DCUO's new story content is free, though those with an optional subscription will be able to enjoy more rewards, character slots, and powers to choose from. DCUO isn't the only superhero MMORPG on the block, but its wide availability on both consoles and PC (and cross-play between PlayStation and PC players) does make it an easy choice for this list.\n\nThrone and Liberty's gameplay will instantly feel familiar to anyone who has played an MMORPG in the last two decades, with tab-targeting combat that heavily evokes WoW's gameplay. Where Throne and Liberty differs is in its impressive graphical fidelity, focus on open-world PvP, skills defined by weapon type instead of classes, and the use of players' animal-shapeshifting forms in order to sprint, glide, and swim around its world of Solisium instead of traditional mounts. Though much of its endgame focus is on large guild vs. guild castle sieges, there is still plenty of PvE content as well, including world events and dungeons.\n\nGiven its free-to-play nature, its endgame can become a bit grindy, but those looking for a satisfying MMORPG without a subscription could do much worse than Throne and Liberty. It's also one of the few MMORPGs on consoles, and, unlike other console MMOs like ESO, supports cross-play between platforms. Its first free expansion, Wilds of Talandre, releases in March 2025 and will introduce a new zone to explore, solo dungeons for players to conquer, and a revamp of its weapon mastery system.\n\nKnown for its massive spaceship battles with thousands of players, EVE Online is still one of the best MMORPGs available after two decades on the market. A true sandbox MMO where players are largely left to pursue their own interests--whether that's engaging in PvP battles or starting a trade empire--the entirety of its player base plays on a single server, and the actions its players take leave a lasting impact both on its in-game universe and its bustling player-driven economy.\n\nEven if its actual gameplay isn't quite as exciting as it might sound on paper (get used to looking at lots of menus and going AFK while your ship completes assigned actions), it's the stakes behind each action that give everything in EVE Online's world meaning. EVE Online can certainly be confusing for new players, but for those who stick with it and get involved with its various player-run communities, it's easy to see why the game is still being played 20 years later.\n\nThe original superhero MMO, 2004's City of Heroes, has found new life after having been taken offline by NCSoft in 2012. A fan server called City of Heroes: Homecoming received an official license to operate the game in 2024, and now City of Heroes is once again playable completely for free, with a volunteer team keeping the game running and updated thanks to player donations.\n\nCity of Heroes stands out thanks to its detailed character creator, where players get to choose not only their powers, but their origin story, costume, and even backstory. From there it's up to players to protect Paragon City as a hero or join the forces of villainy on The Rogues Isle, battling foes and joining Supergroups of other players along the way. Though City of Heroes is somewhat dated by today's standards, there is a reason many players have fond memories of their time with the MMO, as it offers a unique experience that can't be found in other games within the genre, even as games like DC Universe Online and Cryptic's spiritual successor, Champions Online, have since looked to follow in City of Heroes' footsteps.\n\nBlack Desert is a highly in-depth MMORPG that places a major emphasis on combat systems and customization. You might have heard that Black Desert has one of the steepest learning curves of any MMO, and that statement wouldn't be inaccurate. There are over a dozen classes to pick from in Black Desert, and each one offers a totally different way of approaching combat. You'll mostly engage in combat with real players and AI enemies, both of which require the utmost precision and lightning-fast reflexes to defeat. However, Black Desert also offers siege combat, allowing you to participate in large-scale wars in PvE or PvP.\n\nIf combat isn't your main interest, Black Desert features a massively open world with a slew of content to explore. You can complete quests, level up a slew of skills, and hunt for new gear. You'll also be able to customize your character in truly staggering ways, as the game has hundreds of clothing and appearance options.\n\nOnce Human isn't your traditional World of Warcraft-type MMORPG, but it's still a massive role-playing game nonetheless. The game starts by you joining a server and going through a tutorial for how its various mechanics work. Then, you'll be on your own in a huge map that features differently-scaled areas. Each area is available for you to venture into from the start, but the enemies in an area will all be at a specific level. To successfully navigate the areas, you need to level up your character by completing main story quests, which mainly involve the same gameplay loop, and jobs for various NPCs at the hub center of each area.\n\nCombat in Once Human involves guns as well as melee and long-range weapons, and all of the weapons in the game can be crafted at your base. Base-building plays a major role in Once Human, as it's how you unlock a majority of the game's usable content and helps to level up your character. When you venture outside your base, though, you'll have to keep your character healthy, as Once Human is also a survival game that has a hunger, thirst, and stamina bar, all of which need to be constantly maintained. It's a unique MMO experience that relies less on multiplayer elements, but other real players are still packed into a server with you.\n\nThe First Descendant is a game that falls somewhere in between a few different genres. However, by definition, it's a massively multiplayer online game that features role-playing elements. At its core, however, The First Descendant is a looter shooter that allows you to team up with other players to complete PvE objectives and defeat bosses. There is no PvP combat, but there's certainly enough content to keep you invested. The looting, which comes from defeating enemies and quests, is mostly RNG, so you'll often have to grind for hours to unlock a piece of content for your character or weapons. The gameplay is extremely enjoyable, though, so you'll often have no quarrel with grinding out gear.\n\nPalia is one of the very few MMORPGs that doesn't feature any sort of combat. Instead, you're placed in a world where you're tasked with building your dream home. Set in a fantasy world, Palia also falls into the life-simulator genre, allowing you to build and create anything your imagination can cook up. Of course, not everything is handed to you, as you'll have to venture out into the world to explore the various towns and other environments. Everywhere in Palia is teeming with life, and you'll even meet other players in the various hub areas, or you can visit them at the home they've built. Palia also offers plenty of lore that you learn as you explore, making it feel like you're a part of a real community.",

The modern world possessed immense energy and extraordinary technical power, yet what earlier civilisations had assumed almost instinctively — a centre — was no longer obvious.\n\nIn the decades since, progress has only accelerated. Communication has become global, calculation instantaneous, and information pervasive. These achievements are remarkable. But power alone does not create civilisation. Energy, however abundant, does not by itself produce order. Without shared forms — without agreement about how knowledge is shaped, preserved, and handed on — progress becomes empty motion.\n\nAnd yet civilisation did not collapse.\n\nWe did not abandon the physical world — we still enjoy good food, need sleep, and seek shelter from the cold. But the centre of our shared life began to shift. Increasingly, what mattered most was not the mass of things we possessed, but the structures through which we cooperated: the ways knowledge was recorded, shared, corrected, and carried forward. In these invisible arrangements, civilisation found new means of continuity.\n\nIt is this reconfiguration — subtle, incomplete, and still fragile — that I want to consider here.\n\nThis development was not, in truth, without precedent. Civilisation has never been sustained by authority alone. Even in periods of strong government or settled belief, its real work has relied on voluntary association — on people choosing to cooperate around a shared purpose worth sustaining.\n\nIn the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, this impulse found expression in what came to be known as the Republic of Letters. It was a territory defined not by borders, but by ink. Ideas travelled slowly between desks and studies, often ignoring the wars of their kings. A philosopher in Paris could dispute first principles with a mathematician in Cambridge; a writer in exile could remain part of a continental conversation.\n\nThey shared no ruler and acknowledged no single doctrine. They differed sharply in temperament and belief, yet understood themselves to be citizens of the same country. What bound them were standards: of evidence, of argument, and of courtesy. Knowledge, in this world, was not a possession to be hoarded, but a light to be shared.\n\nFor a long time, this spirit receded from view. The industrial age taught us the virtues of enclosure. We built fences around land, walls around factories, and increasingly, legal barriers around ideas. Where value was material, scarce, and costly to produce, ownership became the principal means by which it was recognised and protected — and it still serves us well.\n\nBut toward the end of the twentieth century, a curious pattern re-emerged. Among scientists, engineers, and students working at the edges of a new digital machinery, the established forms of enclosure proved inadequate. To build systems of great complexity with unprecedented reach, one could not behave solely as a proprietor. One had to act, instead, as a participant.\n\nGradually, and without central direction, new commons took shape. Spaces in which the work of one person was offered to the use of many; in which contribution mattered more than possession; and in which rules were sustained not by decree, but by shared understanding. These arrangements relied on a quiet optimism — the belief that human beings, given the opportunity, would prefer to build together rather than to destroy alone.\n\nThey remain fragile. They are easily misunderstood, and easily neglected. Yet upon this assumption — modest, generous, and profoundly human — much of our contemporary civilisation has come to rest.\n\nThe reordering of our digital world began, fittingly, not in a marketplace, but in a place of inquiry. By the late 1980s, computers were already powerful and networks increasingly widespread, yet information remained confined within isolated systems. To move from one to another required a change of language, protocol, or machine. Knowledge existed, but it did not yet flow.\n\nTim Berners-Lee, then working as a physicist and engineer, recognised in this fragmentation something deeper than technical inconvenience: an obstacle to the exchange of ideas. He proposed a simple remedy: a way for documents on different computers to be linked together, addressed through common rules, and retrieved by anyone connected to the network. The means were spare—uniform addresses, shared protocols, plain documents.\n\nAt the time, the prevailing logic was clear. New technologies were enclosed, patented, licensed. They became assets, and then territories. This approach had shaped much of the modern world, and often served it well. But Berners-Lee declined it. He did not claim ownership of the Web, nor place it behind fees or permissions. Instead, he released its protocols openly, allowing anyone to use and build upon them.\n\nThe decision appeared almost administrative. In retrospect, it was decisive. A system intended to connect the world could not begin by demanding entry. By refusing to own the Web, Berners-Lee allowed it to function as neutral ground — a public space without a gatekeeper.\n\nClark once described courtesy as the discipline by which we restrain our own claims in order to make room for others. In this sense, the Web was an act of courtesy expressed in technology. Its enduring power lies as much in its refusals as in its capabilities.\n\nFrom that restraint flowed much that followed.\n\nIf the Web was founded on an act of courtesy, the system that made it durable was built on something more bracing: an uncompromising respect for how things actually work.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Linus Torvalds, then a student at the University of Helsinki, began writing the core of an operating system. The impulse was practical rather than ideological. His professor, Andrew S. Tanenbaum, had created MINIX—an elegant, Unix-inspired teaching system—so that students could study the anatomy of an operating system. But MINIX was not intended for everyday use, and it did not run on Torvalds’s own machine in the way he required.\n\nOut of a mixture of curiosity and irritation, he decided to build something that would.\n\nWhat is striking, even in hindsight, is how complete that decision already was. The earliest public release of Linux was not a sketch or a manifesto. It was a working kernel: multitasking, memory-managed, architecturally coherent. It revealed, from the outset, a deep and practical understanding of how operating systems behave under real constraints. Authority, in this case, did not need to be asserted. It was visible in the code.\n\nWhen the system reached a point where others might find it useful, Torvalds released it with a plain invitation: use it, improve it, tell me what breaks.\n\nThere was no manifesto and no appeal to higher ideals. There was simply work to be done.\n\nHe did not come to this characteristic pragmatism from a vacuum. He had begun programming at the age of eleven, and grew up in a household where intellectual argument was neither rare nor intimidating. His parents were journalists, his grandfather a statistician. Ideas, facts, and disagreement were part of ordinary conversation, not marks of authority.\n\nHe was named, with ambiguity, after the scientist and peace activist Linus Pauling—or, as he later remarked, perhaps equally after the Linus from Peanuts. The joke is revealing. It suggests a temperament comfortable with seriousness, but resistant to solemnity; respectful of ideas, but impatient with reverence.\n\nThat impatience would become legendary. Torvalds was blunt, intolerant of sloppy reasoning, and openly dismissive of work that failed to meet clear standards. In another setting, such a manner might have proved destructive. In this one, it served a clarifying purpose.\n\nWhat emerged around Linux surprised almost everyone. Programmers from across the world began to contribute—not because they were commanded to, and not because they were paid, but because the standards were unmistakable and the results visible. Authority arose where competence was demonstrated. Disputes were frequent, sometimes fierce, but they were settled not by rank, but by the quality of the work itself.\n\nLinux showed that order need not depend on hierarchy. It could arise from shared standards, rigorous review, and a willingness to reject what did not meet them. The collaboration endured not because everyone agreed, but because disagreement was channelled into improvement rather than paralysis.\n\nToday, the result of that discipline is so pervasive that it has become effectively invisible. Linux runs the watch on a wrist and the rocket in the void; it governs the flow of global finance and the monitors of intensive care. The banker, the surgeon, and the statesman rely upon it every second of their lives, yet few could name it—or the man who began it. It has become the silent, universal substrate of modern civilisation.\n\nAs the project grew, a new problem appeared. The accumulation of changes—branching paths, conflicting versions, overlapping experiments—threatened to overwhelm its own history. Torvalds’s response was direct. He built a tool to address the problem properly, from first principles, in a matter of days.\n\nIt is an obstinate word for an obstinate tool. Torvalds explained the choice with a certain wry self-knowledge: “I’m an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself.” This joke was a refusal to pretend otherwise.\n\nGit altered the way collective memory was handled. Instead of a single, authorised record guarded at the centre, it allowed every participant to hold a complete and inspectable history. Experiments could diverge without endangering the whole, and failures could be acknowledged without erasure. Continuity was preserved without supervision, and responsibility without humiliation.\n\nIn civilisational terms, this was no small matter. Git provided what large institutions have always struggled to maintain: a reliable memory that tolerates error while remaining accountable. It made cooperation at scale possible, and more importantly, sustainable.\n\nTorvalds rarely spoke of these achievements in elevated language, and perhaps that is part of their strength. He distrusted abstraction and disliked ceremony. Yet through an insistence on standards—sometimes uncomfortable, often demanding—he demonstrated that order can emerge without command.\n\nIf Berners-Lee’s restraint made room for others to enter, Torvalds’s discipline made it possible for them to stay—and to build.\n\nWe have spoken of individuals, but civilisation does not advance by solitary effort alone. Ideas endure only when they are taken up, tested, corrected, and carried forward by others. What followed the release of the Web and Linux was therefore not an anomaly, but an ascent — collective, distributed, and largely unplanned.\n\nOut of this discipline grew structures capable of sustaining effort at scale. Organisations such as the Linux Foundation, the Apache Software Foundation, and the Eclipse Foundation did not command creativity so much as shelter it—providing neutral ground where competing firms, independent developers, and public institutions could collaborate without surrendering control to any single interest.\n\nThese great foundations, joined by a constellation of individual efforts, quietly became both the backbone and the surface of the modern world. They supplied the invisible servers and operating systems upon which industry depends, extending that order to the programming languages, development tools, and utility applications that weave through the texture of daily life.\n\nEarlier civilisations had known voluntary scholarship and shared intellectual purpose. What they lacked were the means to sustain such efforts beyond a narrow elite. The Republic of Letters relied on slow correspondence and fragile memory. Here, by contrast, the technical conditions had fallen into place. The Web offered a common space of address; Git provided a disciplined way to coordinate distributed work while preserving the history of every path taken; and systems like Linux supplied a stable, universal substrate at the machine level.\n\nTogether, these tools did not create generosity — but they gave it form, continuity, and reach. Contribution could be preserved rather than lost, disagreement recorded rather than erased, and improvement accumulated without dissolving into chaos. For the first time, cooperation among strangers could be both rigorous and durable.\n\nWhat emerged was neither a utopia nor a rebellion against institutions. It was a practice — demanding, sometimes severe, but remarkably productive. Authority arose where competence was demonstrated, and responsibility where work was accepted. In this way, the invisible commons acquired not only energy, but memory.\n\nIt was a modest beginning, and an unfinished one. But it marked something new in the history of civilisation: a means by which collective effort could outlast enthusiasm, survive disagreement, and leave behind structures strong enough to build upon.\n\nA way, at last, toward permanence.\n\nCivilisations have always faltered not for lack of knowledge, but for lack of finding it. The great library of Alexandria held its wealth in scrolls; the digital commons held it in billions of fragments, scattered and multiplying. The crisis was one of orientation.\n\nIt required a particular kind of genius to address this: not the genius of the poet, who creates new worlds, but the genius of the librarian, who imposes order upon the old.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, then students at Stanford University,approached this problem with an engineer’s impatience with chaos. They recognised that within the tangled mess of the Web, there lay a hidden structure. Links were more than mere decorations; they were judgments. Every reference implied trust, relevance, and attention. If these signals could be measured, the cacophony of human knowledge might order itself, without the need for a central censor.\n\nPage and Brin set out to implement this theory with their own hands. Much of the early system—from the crawling of pages to the ranking of results—was coded by them, tested against the crushing weight of the real Web, and refined through sleepless nights. Their authority rested on a simple, undeniable premise: they had made the thing work.\n\nTheir ambition, expressed with an engineer’s disarming simplicity, was among the broadest in human history:\n\nBasically, our goal is to organize the world’s information and to make it universally accessible and useful.\n\nFew statements have carried such consequence with so little ornament.\n\nWhat emerged was more profound than a commercial search engine — and more consequential than its creators could fully foresee. It was a new cognitive infrastructure, the likes of which had never existed. Questions that once required travel, training, or immense patience could now be answered in moments. Curiosity ceased to be a privilege of the leisured class. It became a habit of the multitude.\n\nThe organisation they built, Google, quickly outgrew its original function. To organise the world’s information at planetary scale required inventions far beyond indexing. It required a new kind of architecture: distributed computation, fault-tolerant systems, and coordination at unprecedented scale. In solving its own problems, Google was forced to become a builder of new civic infrastructure.\n\nHere, the spirit of the commons reasserted itself in an unexpected form. Having built their edifice upon the open foundations of Linux, Page and Brin began to return the scaffolding to the world. They released Android, placing a general-purpose operating system into billions of hands; they gifted Kubernetes, providing a common language for managing complexity across industries.\n\nThese were acts of calculated necessity. They understood that no single organisation—not even one as vast as theirs—could sustain such complex systems alone.\n\nThis created a productive tension. Google became both a citadel of proprietary power and a primary engine of open infrastructure. It demonstrated that in the modern age, collaboration is more than an ideal; it is a structural necessity.\n\nSuch power inevitably casts shadows. To control the map is to influence how others move, and the risks of such centralisation are real. Yet the original impulse remains unmistakable: a belief that knowledge, once organised, should belong to everyone — and that the tools required to manage this complexity should not be locked behind walls.\n\nPage and Brin belong, in Clark’s sense, among the God-given geniuses who realised their own ambitious visions. They recognised a crisis of confusion in the civilisational record, and with their own craft, built a working answer.\n\nCuriosity, once given structure, became infrastructure.\n\nWhat followed would test how the use of such infrastructure should be judged — and at what human cost.\n\nIf the story ended with the triumph of the Web and the ordering of the map, we might be tempted to call it a victory. But history suggests otherwise. When the pace of civilisation accelerates, it often leaves its institutions behind. And in that widening gap, there are casualties.\n\nAaron Swartz stood squarely in that gap.\n\nBorn in 1986 near Chicago, Swartz was a prodigy, a builder, and — in a deeper sense — a conscience. He belonged naturally to the world of the commons we have been describing, fluent in its technical languages and serious about its moral claims. For him, openness was a principle to be acted upon.\n\nHis contributions began with something deceptively modest. He helped create Markdown, a syntax that appears, at first glance, to be nothing more than plain text. Yet this simplicity was a philosophical choice. By stripping away the complex, fragile interfaces of modern word processing, Markdown liberated the writer to focus on the hierarchy of ideas rather than their ornamentation. It restored a necessary discipline to the act of writing, ensuring that the structure of an argument remained visible, honest, and distinct from its display.\n\nBut the implications of this choice extended far beyond the quiet of the study. Swartz understood that for knowledge to endure, it must be separable from the tools used to create it. Because Markdown treated text as structured data, a document was no longer a dead artifact, but an active component of a system. A specification written in this way could be transformed, by the simplest of scripts, into a website, a technical manual, or even executable code. It opened the way for streamlining the chaotic passage from abstract policy to concrete production, creating an unbroken chain between intention and execution.\n\nIn this sense, Markdown pointed toward a form of civic legibility: a way in which the vast records of society—its laws, its data, its history—might remain intelligible to both human eyes and machine logic, safe from the rot of proprietary obsolescence. It was a small tool, but it became the essential mortar for a civilisation built on code.\n\nBut Swartz’s concern for access did not end with tools. He saw that while the machinery of the commons had become open, many of the great storehouses of human knowledge remained closed. Scholarly research — much of it publicly funded — was locked behind paywalls, accessible primarily to those already inside the gates. To Swartz, this inefficiency rose to the level of moral error.\n\nHis response was literal and uncompromising. In 2011, he attempted to make available a large body of academic work, not for profit, but as an assertion of principle. It was an act of civil disobedience, closer in spirit to the old librarians than to the modern hacker stereotype. Where the digital world saw a custodian of knowledge, the institution saw a violator of rules.\n\nThe collision was severe. Swartz encountered a legal and prosecutorial machinery calibrated for deterrence rather than judgment, and example rather than proportion. The weight of the response far exceeded the scale of the act. What followed is well known, and remains difficult to contemplate.\n\nIt would be easy, at this point, to simplify the story — to assign villains and heroes, to turn tragedy into rhetoric. That would be a mistake. The institutions acted from procedure, Swartz from conviction. What failed here was something more elusive: a shared understanding of how ideals, once embedded in technology, should be reflected in law.\n\nClark once insisted that civilisation depends not only on knowledge, but on sympathy — on the capacity to recognise ourselves in others. The tragedy took the form of a collision: between a commons that had learned to move, and institutions that had not yet learned how to follow. Swartz’s life and death force an uncomfortable question: whether a society that builds its future on openness can afford to treat its most literal adherents as adversaries.\n\nHis story marks the point at which the invisible commons ceased to be merely a technical achievement, and became a moral test. It revealed that access, order, and power cannot be aligned by engineering alone. They require judgment and restraint — and, above all, a sense of proportion.\n\nIn the years that followed, the shock of this failure was not entirely absorbed in silence. Laws were re-examined, prosecutorial practices questioned, and the assumption that access could be criminalised without consequence began, slowly, to weaken. Institutions did not become wiser overnight — but they became more aware.\n\nCivilisation learns unevenly, and often at great cost — usually after the fact. Its progress has rarely depended on perfect obedience, and still less on moral comfort. Again and again, it has been forced forward by individuals willing to test the distance between what is lawful and what is just — and to bear the consequences of that test.\n\nAny consolation that remains lies in memory. Swartz’s insistence did not vanish with him. It entered the moral consciousness of the commons itself, where future generations may yet recognise that law, like technology, cannot remain untouched by human consequence.\n\nIn February 2025, a bust of Aaron Swartz was unveiled in the lobby of the Internet Archive in San Francisco — an institution dedicated to preserving the world’s knowledge and keeping it accessible. Its placement is telling: among readers, archives, and use, rather than courts or seats of power. It marks no victory, announces no verdict, and offers no absolution.\n\nIt simply reminds those who pass beneath it that the commons was not built by compliance alone — and that civilisation, if it is to endure, must always leave room for conscience to speak before the law has learned how to listen.\n\nAfter the moral strain of collision, it is necessary to return to first principles — this time of learning itself. Civilisation, after all, is not preserved by systems alone. It is preserved by transmission: by one mind taking the time to explain something carefully to another.\n\nIn 2004, Sal Khan began without a grand design to reform education. He was tutoring a cousin through the web. The subject was mathematics, and the medium he chose was austere: a black screen, a trail of coloured digital ink, and a voice. This created an aesthetic of pure concentration. The learner watched the thought itself unfolding in real time. Unencumbered by institutional theories or the language of disruption, the work relied entirely on the clarity of the explanation.\n\nFrom this modest beginning grew Khan Academy — an online platform that functioned as a repository of patience. Its distinguishing quality lay in its tone. Concepts were broken down slowly, without embarrassment, and rebuilt step by step, treating the learner simply as an unfinished mind requiring only time and method to complete itself.\n\nThis approach addressed a failure that Clark had observed long before. He remarked that the so-called “top people” of earlier generations were often charming but poorly informed, while students in provincial universities were sharper, more curious, and more alert. The barrier between them was access—specifically, access to explanation.\n\nKhan Academy demonstrated that high culture could be shared in its full complexity. Calculus, physics, economics, and history could be made intelligible while remaining rigorous. Explanation, when offered with care, became a form of respect.\n\nHere, the tools of the invisible commons reached their most humane expression. The Web provided reach; search made discovery possible; open infrastructure kept costs low. Yet the motive force was the act of explanation itself. The teacher stood alongside the learner, treating the student as a capable mind, and making learning an act of invitation rather than one of ranking, filtering, or exclusion. This restoration of dignity remains one of the most consequential achievements of the digital age.\n\nIt is striking that a platform of this global reach and massive utility was founded on a single voice, repeated patiently thousands of times. Even as the project expanded, it retained this intimacy. While traditional schools carry responsibilities far beyond explanation, Khan proved that the continuity of knowledge operates independently of hierarchy. It advances most reliably where the responsibility for clarity is personal, continuous, and owned by a human voice.\n\nIn the end, his contribution reminds us of a truth often obscured by scale and abstraction: that alongside genius and conscience, civilisation depends upon explanation—offered freely, received humbly, and carried forward, one mind at a time.\n\nWe have traced a lineage defined less by doctrine than by a series of human gestures: restraint at the beginning, discipline in the making, generosity in collaboration, conscience under strain, and patience in explanation. Taken together, they suggest that the digital age grew around a distinct, if quiet, centre.\n\nThat centre resides beyond the reach of institutions, ideologies, or markets. It lives in a set of practices—ways of working, judging, and explaining—through which knowledge is made durable and meaning carried forward. They are largely invisible, easily neglected, yet without them the energy of an age leaves nothing that lasts.\n\nCivilisation, as Clark understood, is defined by what it chooses to preserve. Permanence emerges through restraint; through the refusal to enclose what could be enclosed; through standards maintained without command; through explanations offered again, for the sake of someone still learning. Far from the habits of conquest, these are the gestures by which civilisation endures.\n\nYet they remain fragile. Tools may embody values, yet judgment cannot be automated. Institutions can preserve order, yet adaptation lags behind change. Genius may illuminate a path, yet sympathy and proportion determine how far that path can be followed. Again and again, endurance depends less on intelligence than on moral habit.\n\nThe digital world now shapes how we learn, how we work, how we remember, and how we judge one another. Whether it will lift civilisation — or merely accelerate it — remains an open question. The answer lies in the care with which these systems are used, extended, and restrained.\n\nCivilisation has always been a provisional achievement. It must be built, maintained, and renewed by each generation. The invisible commons will endure only if it is treated as a trust.\n\nAnd that, perhaps, is the measure of our moment: not whether we can build systems of astonishing complexity, but whether we can give them the forms, the sympathy, and the permanence required to make them worthy of civilisation itself.",

    "description": "An exploration in using Passkeys as generalized cryptographic seed material to address new use cases, while inheriting the benefits of cross-device synced keys with native biomentric UX.",
    "fullText": "In my time at Microsoft, I worked on the team responsible for the development and standardization of Passkeys. Passkeys have made standard, secure, cryptographic authentication accessible to all users, but the model is tightly restricted to website/app login.\n\nEven with a deep, code-level understanding of passkeys and WebAuthn, it wasn’t until now, six years later, that I realized a set of properties and behaviors present within Passkeys could be hijacked to make this post possible. This ‘feature’ was sitting right there and feels so obvious in retrospect. It just goes to show if you remain curious and turn over every rock, you can bend technology to do new and interesting things.\n\nPassSeeds is a hack that explores this question: can we hijack the capabilities and UX of passkeys for use cases that stretch beyond their rigid login model and limited key-type support? The status quo of many Web-based use cases involving long-held cryptographic keys is often users pasting key material into sites/apps or buying special hardware devices that are difficult for less technical folks to use.\n\nTo understand PassSeeds, it helps to have some awareness of the underlying Passkey technology they are based on.\n\nPasskeys are asymmetric key pairs formatted as WebAuthn credentials, typically used to replace passwords for website logins. A key pair is created on the user’s device for a website and stored in a secure hardware module. Access to and usage of these key pairs is scoped to the origin of the site they were created on (for example: example.com, other.example.com, test.com). Passkeys are replicated across a user’s devices by the platform (iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager, Windows Hello, etc.) via an end-to-end encrypted sync process. Below is a basic overview of the two primary UX flows for generating a passkey and using one for login:\n\nThere are several attributes of Passkeys to keep in mind that are critical to the PassSeed mechanism detailed in this post:\n\nGiven these attributes of the Passkey model, even public keys in the system behave like a natively provisioned, hardware-secured, synced secret, even though cryptography does not require them to be secret. This is a rare and valuable set of properties many products, services, and protocols find highly desirable.\n\nPasskeys provide biometrically gated use of cryptographic keys, but they were created specifically for authentication signing in centralized website login flows. Meanwhile, web apps that need cryptographic material and curves that passkeys don’t support (secp256k1 for Bitcoin, BLS12-381 for ZKPs, etc.) remain primitive and convoluted. Users copy 12–24 words, stash JSON keystores, or paste raw keys across apps. PassSeeds introduces a novel approach: treat the passkey’s P‑256 public key itself as seed material and retrieve it on demand through ECDSA public‑key recovery. The authenticator still keeps the private key and user‑verification requirements, but the recovered public‑key bytes become the deterministic PassSeed that can serve as the foundation for other cryptographic use cases.\n\n(If you don’t want to understand how it works, you can skip to the DEMO)\n\nAssumptions: you have created a passkey, did not export the public key anywhere at generation time, and do not allow any signatures from the passkey outside of the generating origin’s local boundary.\n\nRegeneration via ECDSA Key Recovery\n\nRecovery / Rotation\n\nIf a device is lost, but other devices with the passkey that backs the PassSeed are still available, any new device added to the accout of the user will have their PassSeed automatically synced upon device enrollment, which is a process handled by the native platform. If all devices with the backing passkey are lost, you can still access and control whatever was tied to your PassSeed via the exported mnemonic phrase, if you elected to do that (which is strongly recommeded). Because PassSeeds and their backing Passkeys cannot be imported into the Passkey mechanism, if you lose all devices with the backing Passkey, you will need to transfer anything tied to the old PassSeed to a new one on your active devices (again, assuming you backed up your PassSeed via exporting its mnemonic phrase).\n\nTo make the PassSeed user-friendly, the implementation converts the 32-byte PassSeed into a standard BIP-39 mnemonic. In practice, the PassSeed is the SHA-256 hash of the recovered public key, represented as 32 bytes. Users can write down the phrase to ensure that even if something happens to their PassSeed (e.g. they accidentially delete it), they can retain access to the keys it is capable of producing. Rerunning the ECDSA recovery process with the same passkey deterministically yields the same phrase.\n\nOnce you have the PassSeed (public key bytes or its mnemonic-derived entropy), you can deterministically derive other cryptographic material:\n\nThe following are the code snippets for the core methods from the PassSeed TypeScript implementation, avaiable in the PassSeed Github repo. Some of the methods reference helpers that are contained in the module, but are not shown here, for brevity.\n\nThis method orchestrates the complete WebAuthn credential creation flow, extracts the credential’s P-256 public key from the CBOR attestation object, and returns a hex-encoded SHA-256 hash of the public key bytes.\n\nThis method retrieves an existing passkey (optionally by credential ID), performs two WebAuthn signatures over the same challenge, reconstructs the public key via ECDSA recovery by intersecting candidate points from both signatures, and returns the hex-encoded PassSeed string.\n\nThis method converts a 32-byte PassSeed (as bytes or hex) into a human-readable BIP-39 mnemonic phrase for backup and recovery, optionally truncating to 16 bytes for a 12-word phrase before handing entropy to bip39.entropyToMnemonic with the English wordlist.\n\nThe authenticator still enforces RP binding and user verification before issuing signatures, so phishing resistance mirrors standard passkeys. The host page sees two signatures and the recovered public key, values one must assume the host can exfiltrate. Because the same message is signed twice, replay risk is mitigated by including nonces, RP ID, and a strict prefix so signatures cannot be repurposed. Syncable passkeys inherit the platform’s end-to-end encrypted sync features.\n\nThe WebAuthn specification has defined a PRF extension for deterministically generating per-credential secrets, and a Large Blob extension, which can be used to encrypt and save a randomly generated secret that is synced across the user’s devices, both of which could achieve the desired ends. The problem is API support: PRF and Large Blob features are not implemented across browsers today, and there is no signal that either will be in the near future. That makes it hard to rely on in production if you need your app to work everywhere.\n\nPassSeeds can even be used to create a polyfill for the PRF feature: by deterministically recovering a stable cryptographic value from the passkey signature flow (the public key), you can use that value to generate deterministic, cryptographic values based on input values, which will regenerate the same value for the same input, every time. If the tradeoffs of PassSeeds are acceptable, you can integrate PRF-reliant use cases in apps today, across all browsers. I plan on writing a PRF polyfill soon, so stay tuned.\n\nThe following is a demo page that allows you to create PassSeeds, reload the page to test regeneration (via the ECDSA recovery process), and view the Mnemonic phrase of PassSeeds you’ve created: PassSeeds Demo\n\nYou can also include PassSeeds in your Web apps via NPM: PassSeeds NPM Package",

    "fullText": "Jan 6 (Reuters) - Venezuela was loading crude only for U.S. major Chevron on Tuesday, while operations by state-run oil firm PDVSA to load cargoes for its main customers in China ​remained on hold for a fifth day, shipping data showed.\n\nU.S. forces captured President Nicolas Maduro on ‌Saturday and took him to New York to face drug charges. Interim President Delcy Rodriguez is now running the government, which the U.S. ‌has said it will oversee.\n\nThe United States imposed a blockade on sanctioned oil tankers sailing into and out of Venezuelan waters last month, which halted most exports other than those destined for Chevron.\n\nChevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in the country under a U.S. license that exempts it from sanctions imposed by Washington on Venezuela's oil industry ⁠to choke off revenue that financed Maduro's ‌government.\n\nOn Tuesday, several vessels chartered by Chevron were the only ones loading crude for export at Venezuela's Jose and Bajo Grande ports, ship monitoring data showed.\n\nOther ships were loading ‍either to move oil between domestic ports or to store crude because onshore storage was almost completely full, according to PDVSA's internal documents.\n\nThe last crude cargo that was loaded for an Asian customer at Jose finished loading on January 1, according to ​the data and documents. Without more exports, PDVSA could be forced to deepen production cuts it began in ‌recent days because storage tanks are full.\n\nChevron on Monday resumed exports of Venezuelan oil to the U.S. after a four-day pause and called workers abroad back to its Venezuelan offices as flights to the country restarted. The U.S. firm has emerged in recent weeks as the only company fluidly exporting Venezuela's crude.\n\nAt least a dozen vessels under sanctions that had loaded in December and had been stuck in Venezuela's waters due to the embargo sailed in ⁠early January.\n\nThose vessels were carrying around 12 million barrels of ​crude and fuel. It was unclear where the vessels were heading, ​although they were initially loaded for customers in China. The ships left in \"dark mode,\" which means that transponders that send out their location were switched off. The vessels appeared to break ‍the U.S. tanker blockade.\n\nThe U.S. ⁠government has not commented on the vessels or whether it authorized the departures. PDVSA has not replied to a request for comment. Chevron said this week it continues to operate \"in full compliance with all relevant ⁠laws and regulations.\"",

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — Pamela Smart, who is serving life in prison for orchestrating the murder of her husband by her teenage student in 1990, is seeking to overturn her conviction over what her lawyers claim were several constitutional violations.\n\nThe petition for habeas corpus relief was filed Monday in New York, where she is being held at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women, and, in New Hampshire, where the murder happened.\n\n“Ms. Smart’s trial unfolded in an environment that no court had previously confronted — wall-to-wall media coverage that blurred the line between allegation and evidence,” Jason Ott, who is part of Smart’s legal team, said in a statement. “This petition challenges whether a fair adversarial process took place.”\n\nThe move comes about seven months after New Hampshire Gov. Kelly Ayotte rejected a request for a sentence reduction hearing. Ayotte said she reviewed the case and decided it was not deserving of a hearing.\n\nA spokesman for the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision said it would have no comment about the petition.\n\nA spokeman for New Hampshire’s attorney general said it would not comment on pending litigation “other than to note that the State maintains Ms. Smart received a fair trial and that her convictions were lawfully obtained and upheld on appeal.”\n\nIn their petition, lawyers for the 57-year-old Smart argue that prosecutors misled the jury by providing them with inaccurate transcripts of surreptitiously recorded conversations of Ms. Smart that included words that were not audible on the recordings. Among the words they claim weren't audible but in the transcript were the word killed in the sentence “you had your husband killed,\" the word busted in the sentence “I'm gonna be busted\" and the word murder in the sentence “this would have been the perfect murder.”\n\n“Modern science confirms what common sense has always told us: when people are handed a script, they inevitably hear the words they are shown,” Smart’s attorney, Matthew Zernhelt, said in a statement. “Jurors were not evaluating the recordings independently — they were being directed toward a conclusion, and that direction decided the verdict.”\n\nLawyers also argued the conviction should be overturned because the verdict was tainted by the media attention and due to faulty instructions to the jury. They argued jurors were told they must find that Smart acted with premeditation, not told they must consider only evidence presented at trial.\n\nThey also argued the trial court gave her a mandatory life sentence without parole for being an accomplice to first-degree murder, despite New Hampshire not mandating that sentence for the charge.\n\nSmart was a 22-year-old high school media coordinator when she began an affair with a 15-year-old boy who later fatally shot her husband, Gregory Smart, in Derry. The shooter was freed in 2015 after serving a 25-year sentence. Although Smart denied knowledge of the plot, she was convicted of being an accomplice to first-degree murder and other crimes and sentenced to life without parole.\n\nIt took until 2024 for Smart to take full responsibility for her husband’s death. In a video released in June, she said she spent years deflecting blame “almost as if it was a coping mechanism.”\n\nSmart’s trial was a media circus and one of America’s first high-profile cases about a sexual affair between a school employee and a student. The student, William Flynn, testified that Smart told him she needed her husband killed because she feared she would lose everything if they divorced and that she threatened to break up with him if he didn't kill her husband. Flynn and three other teens cooperated with prosecutors and all have since been released.\n\nFlynn and 17-year-old Patrick Randall entered the Smarts’ Derry condominium and forced Gregory Smart to his knees in the foyer. As Randall held a knife to the man’s throat, Flynn fired a hollow-point bullet into his head. Both pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and were sentenced to 28 years to life. They were granted parole in 2015. Two other teenagers served prison sentences and have been released.\n\nThe case inspired Joyce Maynard’s 1992 book “To Die For” and the 1995 film of the same name, starring Nicole Kidman and Joaquin Phoenix.",

    "description": "If you want to doomscroll less this year, try these realistic tips from screen time...",
    "fullText": "If you want to doomscroll less this year, try these realistic tips from screen time coaches\n\nSimple daily rituals for building fun, calm and play into your days in 2026\n\nI wish time travel were real. If it were, I’d go back to 2006 – the year before the release of the first iPhone. A time when doomscrolling didn’t exist, and the thought of a phone call didn’t cause me a rush of anxiety.\n\nAnd many Americans agree. On social media, some are already labeling 2026 “the age of analog”, swapping Spotify for a record player and a smartphone lens for a film camera.\n\nPlenty of advice already exists out there on how to reduce screen time. But we were on the hunt for unique tips that went beyond silencing phone notifications or setting time limits.\n\nI asked for advice from a slew of experts who study addiction and digital detoxing and have written best-selling books on managing screen time (we’ve shared them in a reading list below). From putting a rubber band around your phone to writing a breakup letter to it, below are realistic 15 strategies that might actually help cut down on scrolling.\n\nIf you’re feeling very brave, make sure to read our last (and most vulnerable) tip. Then, at the very end, get some inspiration for screen-free activities from the Filter team.\n\nPower On: Managing Screen Time to Benefit the Whole Family by Ash Brandin\n\nDopamine Nation by Dr Anna Lembke\n\nThe Official Dopamine Nation Workbook by Dr Anna Lembke\n\nHow to Break Up with Your Phone by Catherine Price\n\nThe Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in a High-Tech World by Adam Gazzaley and Dr Larry Rosen\n\nBefore doing anything, view how much you’re currently averaging in your smartphone’s stats.\n\nIt also helps to become mindful of when you choose to pick up your phone – and what you’re feeling at the time. Bored? Stressed? “Sometimes it just helps me to ask: what need is this meeting? What is it I’m seeking? What am I trying to get from this?” said Ash Brandin, an educator and author of Power On.\n\nYou can also try a physical reminder to pause. “One thing I often suggest is that you put a rubber band or a hair tie around your phone for a couple of days,” said health journalist Catherine Price, the author of How to Break Up with Your Phone and The Power of Fun. “When you reach for your phone on autopilot, you think: why is that on my phone?”\n\nYou could set a time limit for using an app, but that often doesn’t work – and can even increase your screen time, according to a study conducted by Dr Jordan Etkin, a Duke University professor who researches how people set goals. Instead, she recommended setting “hard limits”, which means a limit that can’t be changed once set.\n\nTo set a “hard limit”, Price suggested apps such as Opal and Freedom, which allow you to put apps and websites on a “block list” and schedule focus sessions. Freedom (which offers a free trial) also lets you sync multiple devices and offers a “locked” mode to help you resist ending a session early.\n\nThis turns your phone into “a tool that helps you do the things you want to do, that doesn’t suck away at your life”, she said. Price is also a fan of Brick, a physical tool that locks you out of distracting apps of your choosing until you use your phone to unlock them.\n\nIf the mere sight of your phone leaves you with the urge to scroll, try putting it somewhere that makes you have to look for it.\n\n“If you’re at work and you want to focus, keep your phone in your bag or in your jacket,” said Dr Kostadin Kushlev, who has researched the benefits of “digital detoxing” at Georgetown University.\n\nAt night, Price recommended leaving your phone outside of your bedroom and swapping your smartphone’s alarm for a physical alarm clock. (Price’s husband uses this retro table clock.) Otherwise, after seeing all your notifications, “you’re guaranteed that you’re going to start your day on someone else’s terms,” she said.\n\nIf you find yourself doomscrolling in your free time, try taking up a screen-free activity or hobby.\n\n“Make it less about trying to cut back and more about filling our lives with things that we enjoy,” said Price, who enjoys jamming out on the drums in her spare time.\n\nAnd if you aren’t sure where to start, Brandin advised figuring out what purpose your phone is fulfilling and translating it to offline hobbies. For instance, if you resort to task-oriented games such as Candy Crush for a mindless distraction, try a crochet kit.\n\nIt can feel too easy to pick up your phone when you have a free second.\n\nTo make it less convenient to scroll, Lembke advised offloading tempting apps and powering your phone off between uses.\n\nOr if you’re feeling brave, you can take a page from Lembke, who leaves her house without her phone and keeps any necessary apps on her laptop, “so that it’s not quite so accessible and quite so mobile”.\n\nLembke advised turning on “grayscale” mode in your phone’s display settings, which “is a good way to make it less potent”. And if you’re worried that you won’t remember how to switch it back to color, Price has shared how to create an accessibility shortcut that allows you to easily toggle between the two modes.\n\nYou can also try decreasing your algorithm’s power. If you often fall down YouTube rabbit holes, turn off its “recommendations” feature. That way, you have to manually search for every new video, Lembke said.\n\nIf you need a physical reminder of why you’d like to make a change to your screen time, Price advises you to write a “breakup” letter to your phone.\n\n“Truly think about your phone as a partner in a relationship. What do you love about it, but what’s not working? How has it helped you? How is it hurting you?” Price said.\n\nMany of the experts advised taking planned time away from your phone.\n\nDr Larry Rosen, co-author of The Distracted Mind and a research psychologist, recommended “tech breaks”, consisting of two minutes of screen time, followed by 15 to 30 minutes of focused, distraction-free work. “Then you’re controlling the break,” he said.\n\nIf you’re up for a challenge, you can also try taking an extended break. “You do feel better,” Lembke said. It also forces you to connect with people in your life. “In the face of boredom and discomfort, people typically reach out to other people.”\n\nIf you don’t want to go without a smartphone completely, try swapping with a loved one.\n\nOn the weekends, Etkin, the Duke professor, trades phones with her partner. “That way we can get a hold of each other if we need to, and we could check something if we need to. But we can’t be on our own media streams,” she said.\n\nLooking for more tips? Consider subscribing to the Guardian’s Reclaim your brain newsletter for more ways to reduce your screen time in 2026.\n\nRecently, I’ve been trying a whole slew of hobbies to replace scrolling on TikTok. A few of my favorites are watercoloring and reading on my Kindle. And despite the chilly weather, I love going for a run. I also asked my Filter colleagues about screen-free things they liked to do, and here’s what they said.\n\nNick Mokey, Filter editor: Now that I work from home, I actually miss the days of commuting into an office by bike every day, and I find myself inventing excuses to run errands on two wheels: buying groceries, getting a haircut, meeting friends for a beer.\n\nI’ve never arrived anywhere in a worse mood after biking there, and when I catch clear skies in the winter, a bike commute can become the highlight of an otherwise mundane day. With both no screen and no earbuds for safety, it’s a total disconnect from all things digital.\n\nKaren Yuan, Filter US commissioning editor: Is it a cop-out to say my favorite screen-free activity is taking a walk? Especially very long walks.\n\nA couple years ago, I fell in love with solo backpacking, and since then I’ve hiked through forests and dirt roads in Spain, France and Japan with my trusty Osprey Mira 32L. I love taking these walking tours of new places because they force me to just take in and enjoy what’s around me.\n\nAnd because I can’t always up and leave my everyday life, I try to keep that mindset at home, too – by taking long evening walks around my Brooklyn neighborhood that help me view all my familiar sights anew.",

    "fullText": "As Venezuelans attempt to regain a semblance of normalcy after the US capture of President Nicolás Maduro, authorities in the country are cracking down on any show of support to the beleaguered leader’s removal.\n\nAs Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as Venezuela’s acting leader on Monday, rights group warned of escalating repression, with checkpoints being erected around the country, amid reports of price gouging and growing hunger.\n\nOfficials imposed a decree on Monday, which grants broad powers to the presidency and orders security forces to capture “any person involved in the promotion or support” of the weekend attack by the US.\n\nThat same day, Venezuelan security forces temporarily detained 14 journalists, including reporters who were covering the swearing-in of the country’s national assembly, according to the national press union. No explanation was given for their detention.\n\nIt also emerged that political prisoners had their visiting rights suspended and are being prevented from communicating with the outside world, according to the Committee for the Liberation of Political Prisoners in Venezuela.\n\nThe committee added that checkpoints have been going up in cities around the country, with people being searched and detained for possessing “digital material” linked to the US military action.\n\nVenezuela’s Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello posted two videos on Instagram showing security forces in the capital. In one video, a group of armed men can be heard shouting: “Loyal always, traitors never!”\n\nSilence and anxiety grip the capital Caracas, caused by the shock of the January 3 attack and the fear of the government’s heavy-handed response.\n\nThere is still a heavy police presence in Caracas, even if there are fewer soldiers patrolling the streets.\n\nThere has been little sign of public dissent or even anti-government posts on social media. The fear of reprisal looms large under a regime notorious for punishing dissent, especially given the officials in charge of past crackdowns, Cabello and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López, remain in their roles.\n\nSince Sunday, pro-government groups have taken to the streets to demand the release of Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores. But these types of demonstrations have been limited in size and scope.\n\nEven in the face of uncertainty, Venezuelans seem ready to move forward.\n\nMore civilians were seen milling out on the streets of Caracas today. Public offices are operating, the Metro is running, the nearby airport is receiving domestic flights, and supermarkets are still selling produce to customers.\n\nSome services are not yet operating at full capacity, due in part to a public holiday, Día de los Reyes (Three Kings’ Day), which has kept many at home.\n\nBut over the next few days, schools are due to reopen, and employees are expected to report back to work full-time. Padrino López told people Sunday to “resume their economic activities, work, and all other types of activities, including educational activities, in the coming days.”\n\nThe government’s focus seems to be shifting toward restarting the economy, which has been flashing warning signs this week.\n\nVenezuela’s currency, the Bolívar, has suffered a sharp devaluation. Yesterday, there were areas in the city of Maracaibo where stores and shops only accepted cash, and the exchange rate was 900 to 1,000 Bolívares to the US dollar (it is normally around 300).\n\nAmid reports of price gouging, some shelves across the country have started to empty.\n\nReports of hunger are relentless in areas farther from the city. In the east of the country, businesses in smaller cities have removed prices altogether.\n\nThe challenges plaguing the country are abundant. But Venezuelans, having endured years of crises, know how to tackle adversity.\n\nCaracas merchant Douglas Sanchez told Reuters Monday that in the midst of the chaos and desperation, “those of us who work day to day, who eat day to day” have to keep making money. “Because if you don’t go out to work, you don’t have anything.”\n\nCNN’s Jack Guy, Gonzalo Zegarra and Germán Padinger contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "An El Paso high school graduate was remembered for having the \"kindest soul, a beautiful smile, and a heart that cared deeply for everyone\" after she was killed by a driver who allegedly ran a red light, marking El Paso's first traffic-related death of 2026.\n\nAngelique Diaz De Leon, 18, died as she was a passenger in a 2013 Chevrolet Camaro that was hit by a 2023 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck about 2 a.m. on Thursday, Jan.1, on Gateway North Boulevard and Sean Haggerty Drive in the Northeast, El Paso Police Department spokesman Officer Adrian Cisneros said in a news release.\n\nOfficers responding to a two-vehicle crash found Diaz De Leon dead at the scene. An investigation revealed the Silverado driven by 48-year-old Abel Garcia of Chaparral, New Mexico, allegedly failed to stop at a red light and t-boned the Camaro, the news release states.\n\n\"On January 1, 2026, our family lost a piece of our hearts,\" her family wrote on a GoFundMe page. \"Our beautiful Angelique was taken from us far too soon and our world will never be the same without her.\n\n\"Angelique is pure love. She had the kindest soul, a beautiful smile, and a heart that cared deeply for everyone around her. She was smart beyond her years, funny without even trying, and never held anger in her heart. She always helped us, always showed up, and always gave more love than she ever asked for in return.\"\n\nNicholas Jasay Ramirez, 19, of Chaparral, was driving the Camaro and suffered minor injuries.

    "fullText": "Jan 6 (Reuters) - The 92-year-old judge overseeing the Nicolas Maduro case has said he displays a Hebrew scripture from the Torah on the wall of his Manhattan chambers: “Tzedek, tzedek tirdof” — “Justice, justice you shall pursue.\"\n\nAn Orthodox Jew who has been ​on the bench for almost three decades, U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein has been outspoken about how he tries to promote fairness ‌and the impact of his faith on his judicial philosophy.\n\nHellerstein opened the court hearing on Monday by saying he wants a fair trial for the ousted Venezuelan leader, who pleaded not ‌guilty on Monday to narco-terrorism charges.\n\n\"That's my job, and that's my intent,\" Hellerstein said.\n\nON THE SEVENTH DAY HE CONTEMPLATES\n\nHellerstein said in a 2020 podcast that he schedules sentencing hearings for Fridays, so that he can spend Shabbat — the Jewish sabbath from Friday sunset to Saturday nightfall — reflecting on whether the prison sentence he handed down was appropriate.\n\nHellerstein has ruled against President Donald Trump in recent years. He has also spoken up when he believes lawyers are not ⁠best serving their clients.\n\nIn a 2013 law review article, ‌he wrote that some lawyers were \"outraged\" and accused him of \"arrogation of power\" when he rejected a $675 million settlement negotiated between New York City and injured first responders who raced to the World Trade Center after the attacks of ‍September 11, 2001.\n\nHellerstein concluded that, while no statute or rule clearly addressed whether the deal needed his blessing, he had inherent authority to reject it as inadequate.\n\nThe attorneys ended up presenting Hellerstein with a new settlement that added $125 million for victims.\n\nHellerstein \"is a man of strongly held convictions and he seeks to find a way to harmonize ​the law with his understanding of justice,\" said Mitchell Epner, a former federal prosecutor who has observed Hellerstein on the bench.\n\nHellerstein has spoken ‌candidly about how his Jewish values affect his decision-making.\n\n\"As a judge, and as a Jew, I consider that everything I do reflects God and affects His image,\" he wrote in the 2013 article.\n\nIn the 2020 podcast, Hellerstein said he believes he was \"the first Orthodox boy employed by a gentile or Jewish firm in New York City.\"\n\n\"I'm pleased to say that after me there were others, and some credited me with having broken the precedent,\" Hellerstein said.\n\nHellerstein already had a long career before President Bill Clinton nominated him to the federal bench in 1998.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1960, Hellerstein served in the ⁠Judge Advocate General's Corps, the legal arm of the United States Army.\n\nIn 1960, Hellerstein ​joined the now-defunct firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, where he ended up practicing for much ​of his career.\n\nA HISTORY OF REBUKING TRUMP'S LEGAL GAMBITS\n\nIn a high-profile case in 2020, Hellerstein ordered the release of former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen, after Trump's Justice Department tried to revoke his home confinement and return him to jail.\n\nHellerstein ‍concluded Trump's administration was retaliating against Cohen ⁠for writing a book.\n\nIn 2023, Hellerstein denied a request by Trump to move to federal court his New York criminal case relating to a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Trump was tried in state court and found guilty of 34 felony ⁠counts.\n\nIn May 2025, Hellerstein rejected an effort by the Trump administration to use a wartime law to send alleged gang members to Venezuela, saying the men had been improperly denied ‌their day in court.\n\n“This is the United States of America,\" he said. \"People are being thrown out of the country because of ‌their tattoos.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Republicans must win the 2026 midterm elections or else he will get impeached by Democrats.\n\n\"You gotta win the midterms 'cause, if we don't win the midterms, it's just gonna be - I mean, they'll find a reason to impeach me,\" Trump said at a retreat for House Republican lawmakers in Washington. \"I'll get impeached.\"\n\nThe president urged his fellow Republicans to fight in a more unified fashion on issues ranging from gender politics to healthcare and election reforms, and to sell his policies to a public angry about cost of living issues.\n\nTrump's agenda is on the line in November's elections, when all the seats in the House of Representatives and a third of the Senate's seats will be contested.\n\nDuring the speech, Trump predicted an epic win for Republicans in the elections but also expressed concerns about historical precedent that the party of the sitting president usually fares poorly.\n\n\"They say that when you win the presidency, you lose the midterm,\" Trump said at the Kennedy Center, a Washington performing arts center that was recently renamed to include a mention of Trump. \"I wish you could explain to me what the hell's going on with the mind of the public,\" Trump said.\n\nHouse Republicans have shown enormous deference to Trump so far, ceding much of Congress' authority over spending and other matters to his administration. But they have started to show glimmers of independence. The House could vote this week to override a veto Trump issued last month that canceled water projects in Colorado and Utah, though it is not clear whether the effort will get the two-thirds majority needed.\n\nTrump was impeached twice by the Democratic-led House of Representatives during his 2017-2021 term in office, faulting him for what they said were abuses of power involving Ukraine and ahead of the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. The Republican-controlled Senate voted to acquit him in both cases.\n\nReporting by Steve Holland, Trevor Hunnicutt, Bo Erickson, Andy Sullivan and Richard Cowan, Editing by Franklin Paul and Alistair Bell",

    "fullText": "It's only been days since an audacious U.S. raid snatched Nicolás Maduro from a Venezuelan military base and sped him to a Brooklyn prison, yet Detroit-area Trump supporter Aaron Tobin can already see it all playing out on the big screen.\n\nIt'll be the subject of movies for years to come, he predicts. “I am thrilled.” Plenty of others who voted for President Donald Trump and spoke to The Associated Press about the raid are applauding, too — at least for now.\n\nThe seizure of Venezuela's authoritarian leader and his wife has forced another reckoning on the “Make America Great Again” coalition, already rocked by the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files and strained by rising health insurance premiums and living costs.\n\nTrump promised his voters that “America First” would stand against more foreign entanglements. Instead, he intervened with force and without congressional approval in a new frontier, a South American capital so far from Washington that Google Maps says it “can't seem to find a way there.”\n\nThe geopolitical action film that Tobin sees in his mind is only at its opening scene, before all the complexities of uprooting a foreign government by a U.S. president's fiat come rushing in. U.S. forces entered and exited swiftly. But what happens next?\n\nTrump finds early but not endless support\n\nEarly on, the pushback from congressional Republicans and Trump's core constituencies has been guarded, in contrast to their uproar over the Epstein episode or the tensions coursing through Republican politics over the now-expired health insurance subsidies.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Trump voters interviewed by AP journalists around the country praised the operation and expressed faith in Trump's course. But not always limitless faith. They did not all back up Trump's claim that those who “voted for me are thrilled. They said, ‘This is what we voted for.’”\n\n“I support him so far,” Paul Bonner, 67, told AP while browsing at a Trump merchandise store in Bensalem, Pennsylvania. “Until he messes up, I support him.”\n\nTrump's apparent willingness to stay involved in Venezuela and his intensifying rhetoric about expanding U.S. power elsewhere in the hemisphere are making some of his die-hard supporters nervous.\n\nNot all of them are reaching for the popcorn yet.\n\nIn Mississippi, a conflicted Trump voter\n\nChase Lewis, 24, of Philadelphia, Mississippi, said the move caught him off guard and he still isn’t sure whether he supports it. “It’s good that they’re finally freed from that dictatorship,” he said of Venezuelans, “but I don’t know what it’s going to cost us.”\n\nHe added: “I don’t want my friends that are serving right now to be dragged into a war because we went and stuck our nose in Venezuela’s business.” He noted that Trump had campaigned against starting new wars. “Depending on how you look at it,” he said, “this was an act of war.”\n\nAn electrician apprentice who gave up his delivery job because he needed to make more money, Lewis said he wants to see the Trump administration focus on bringing down costs for young people like himself. He also wants the president to make life better for veterans and worries about plunging the country into more conflicts.\n\nIn Colorado, cheers and caution from Trump voters\n\nTo Trump voter Travis Garcia, leaning against his red pickup truck on a chilly evening in Castle Rock, Colorado, it’s a slam-dunk. “Of course I’m going to be happy that they captured a dictator that’s constantly sending drugs our way,” he said, “If we’re not gonna do it, who’s gonna do it?”\n\nThe 45-year-old, who works in remodeling, said the operation reinforces Trump's stature as “a powerful man who follows through on his word and isn’t going to be shy and timid and let other countries run the rules.”\n\nMary Lussier, 48, a flight attendant from the town of Larkspur, was so amazed by the success of the mission in Venezuela that she would be OK with more such operations. She recalled videos of Venezuelans tearfully celebrating Maduro's removal and said fewer bad leaders “would make the world a little bit lesser of a bad place.”\n\nStill, Lussier wouldn’t want U.S. soldiers stuck in a prolonged conflict, and much of her admiration for the operation hinged less on the possible benefits to the U.S. than on the smooth efficiency and bravado of the raiders.\n\nOutside a Safeway grocery store in Castle Rock, Patrick McCans, 66, said delicately that Trump's intervention was “a little contrary to what he campaigned on.”\n\n“I would like to see more of a diplomatic way of making change,” said the retired engineer. Still, he said, pondering for a moment, “I think in this case it might have been warranted.”\n\nInstead of playing ball, Maduro was “playing chicken with Trump, and Trump doesn’t like chicken,” he said, chuckling from beneath a Baltimore Ravens baseball cap.\n\nThe Colorado Trump supporters interviewed by AP all applauded the military operation’s smoothness and “class,” as one described it. But that support could waver if the U.S. is drawn into a longer conflict, which none of them would support.\n\nFew mentioned Trump’s plans for Venezuela’s oil, but thought Maduro's removal would benefit citizens and slow the drug trade and immigration to the U.S.\n\nFrom Pennsylvania: Good riddance to Maduro\n\nAt the Golden Dawn Diner in Levittown, Pennsylvania, Ron Soto, 88, expressed unreserved faith in the president's ability to manage what comes next. The retired tractor-trailer driver regularly visits the diner to meet friends, drink coffee and catch up.\n\nMaduro is an “awful man,” he said. But should U.S. forces go into other countries, like Cuba, as it did in Venezuela? “I don’t think they’ll have to,” he said. “Because he (Trump) put the fear in them.”\n\nAs for Trump's comment at one point that his administration would “run” Venezuela, Soto said the president will “straighten that country out and make it into a democracy if he can. I don’t know if he can.”\n\nAt the Neshaminy Mall, in Bensalem, retired firefighter Kevin Carey, 62, pronounced himself supportive of what Trump did but aware of the risks.\n\n“I wouldn’t say thrilled but I’m cautiously optimistic,” he said. Carey recalled the seizing of U.S. hostages by Iranian revolutionaries in 1979 as an indication of what might happen if the conflict escalates. But “he'll take all actions to avoid that, I believe,” he said of Trump.\n\nOn any further foreign intervention, Carey broke out laughing when he said: “He wants Greenland to be part of America!”\n\nAt the Trump merchandise store where Bonner shopped, banners and other items proclaiming “Trump 2028” are on display. Trump is constitutionally prohibited from running in 2028.\n\n“I know he can’t run for president” in 2028, said Bonner, a propane company worker. Still, he wanted a lawn sign “just to irritate people” but didn't find one.\n\nThe crisp military operation plainly left him impressed. “They got in and they got out, did what they had to do,” he said. Of Maduro, he said: “He’s an enemy of the United States so I support Trump 100%.”\n\nExiting a Walmart in Martinsville, Indiana, Mark Edward Miller, 75, from nearby Mooresville, said the only thing that surprised him about Trump's intervention was that word of it did not leak in advance. The consistent Trump voter was an aircraft maintenance specialist in the Air Force before his retirement.\n\n“I don’t feel like he’s actually taken over a country,” Miller said. “I believe that he’s doing exactly what our country should be doing — supporting, especially in our hemisphere, governments that are friendly with us” and challenging those that are hostile.\n\nTobin, the man in Michigan who sees a cinematic future for the raid, not only approved of the operation but wants more of them.\n\n“Especially if they were as successful as this last one where we didn’t lose any troops, we didn’t lose any planes or ships,” Tobin said during a visit to the Oakland County Republican Party headquarters, where he was surrounded by Trump and GOP memorabilia. “I am thrilled and surprised” by what happened.\n\n“Cuba’s very nervous right now,” he said. “And the Cuban people are suffering immensely from their horrible situation and their economy. Iran might be next.”\n\nThe three-time Trump voter is an active member of the local Republican Party, a certified firearms instructor and head of a bicycling group in his hometown of Oak Park, Michigan.\n\nHis takeaway: “President Trump does not speak idly. If he says he’s going to do something, he does something.”\n\nBedayn reported from Colorado, Catalini from Pennsylvania, Householder from Michigan, Bates from Mississippi, Lamy from Indiana and Woodward from Washington.",

    "description": "\"Can you imagine if a Pringles distributor paid full retail to Pringles and then sold to grocery stores for full retail, and then the grocery stores had to wait for a rebate?\"",
    "fullText": "Mark Cuban has an idea for how to stop the runaway train that is the $38 trillion national debt, and it has a lot to do with the online pharmacy company he founded in January 2022. On Christmas Eve, the billionaire investor posted on X about his frustrations with the insurance market.\n\nInsurers and providers, according to Cuban, “play on the fear and information asymmetry that exists in healthcare.” He advocated for them to be broken up, so as to “make the markets efficient again.”\n\nWhile Cuban’s proposal focused on $100 fines for insurers that over-bill or deny care, the broader thrust of his argument is dismantling opaque middlemen and forcing transparent pricing—as he does with his Cost Plus Drugs pharmacy—could help tame one of the biggest drivers of America’s fiscal strain.​\n\nAmerica’s national debt surged past $38 trillion in October, adding roughly $1 trillion in just over two months in 2025—twice the pace of typical growth since 2000, according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a leading fiscal watchdog. Annual interest payments are already around $1 trillion and could total as much as $14 trillion over the coming decade, a trajectory the watchdog warns is “no way for a great nation like America to run its finances.” A closer look at health insurance and over-billing doesn’t exactly find fixing the issue would fix the debt or deficit​, but Cuban is right that something is definitely off in this space.\n\nCost Plus Drugs sells medications at their manufacturing cost, plus a flat 15% markup, a small pharmacy fee, and a posted shipping charge. The company cuts out traditional pharmacy benefit managers and negotiates directly with manufacturers, publishing acquisition costs and formulas so customers can see exactly how their prices are built.​\n\nFortune and other outlets have reported Cost Plus Drugs can slash the price of some generics from thousands of dollars a month to double‑digit sums, especially for patients who are uninsured or stuck with high deductibles. Cuban argues if similar transparency and direct‑to‑consumer models were applied across health care—combined with rules like letting cash prices count toward insurance deductibles—the country could strip out layers of waste that burden both families and, ultimately, public budgets.",
