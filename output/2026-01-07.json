    "fullText": "Colorado wide receiver/running back Kam Mikell has entered the NCAA transfer portal. The class of 2024 four-star recruit was a top 250 player nationally and the No. 7 athlete in the nation.\n\nAfter redshirting and seeing no action in 2024, Mikell played in 10 games during the 2025 season, starting in one. Mikell's first collegiate start came at running back after beginning the season at wide receiver. He finished the season with 75 rushing yards on 19 carries and added two receptions for five yards.\n\nOn special teams, he played 70 snaps across four different units: kickoff, kickoff return, punt and punt return. Mikell's departure is not surprising, but he was a versatile player who appeared to have a bright future under Deion Sanders' tutelage.\n\nNEW: Colorado WR Kam Mikell enters the NCAA transfer portal, @Hayesfawcett3 reports https://t.co/kSYG7dZ8sR pic.twitter.com/nxCNIgklTe\n\n— Transfer Portal (@TransferPortal) January 7, 2026\n\nWith the recent additions of Danny Scudero and Kam Perry, Mikell likely saw that his playing time would take a big hit if he were to stay in Boulder another season. It will be interesting to see where Mikell lands, as he is on the shorter side for a receiver (6-foot-1) and weighs under 200 pounds (195), which makes him an undersized running back.\n\nFollow Charlie Strella on X, Threads and Instagram.\n\nContact/Follow us @BuffaloesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook for ongoing coverage of Colorado news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Buffaloes Wire: Colorado football RB Kam Mikell transfer portal enter",

    "description": "After 18 seasons, the Baltimore Ravens decided to move on from future Hall of Fame coach John Harbaugh, who won […]",
    "fullText": "After 18 seasons, the Baltimore Ravens decided to move on from future Hall of Fame coach John Harbaugh, who won 180 games and a Super Bowl. He’s undoubtedly the best head coaching candidate available in a league that now has seven vacancies, including the Ravens.\n\nThe Ravens fired Harbaugh so they could hire someone else. Now, another NFL team is reportedly weighing the decision to fire its coach and hire Harbaugh. But which team it is remains unclear.\n\nAccording to Harbaugh’s agent Bryan Harlan, Harbaugh’s availability has already prompted seven calls from NFL teams that have interest in the former Ravens coach. Yet again, only seven teams have vacancies, and the Ravens obviously aren’t calling to say they want him back now.\n\nThis means there’s another team that has yet to move on their head coach, who is currently pondering a switcheroo. That is, if Harbaugh’s agent is telling the truth.\n\nOf course, it’s his job to drive up the price for his client and make it seem like he’s the best thing since sliced bread. Still, it’s not that hard to believe that a team could be interested in upgrading to Harbaugh, who ranks 14th on the NFL’s all-time coaching wins list.\n\nThere’s still speculation that the Pittsburgh Steelers and Mike Tomlin could be headed for a split. How fun would it be for Harbaugh to head to one of the Ravens’ biggest rivals? After all, he knows this division like the back of his hand.\n\nIf not the Steelers, what about a team like the New York Jets? They can’t be too sold on Aaron Glenn after a 3-14 season. Possibly even the Miami Dolphins after Mike McDaniel’s poor start to the 2025 NFL campaign. Though, since McDaniel’s been involved in the GM hiring process, that would be an awkward split.\n\nWe don’t imagine the Indianapolis Colts are thinking about a coaching change after Shane Steichen proved he could lead a dominant effort with improved QB play, even if it was just for a stretch of the season. Yet, anything’s possible.\n\nWould the Washington Commanders consider a change after the bottom fell out on Dan Quinn’s team after they lost eight games in a row? A year after reaching the NFC Conference Championship, we doubt Quinn’s job is in danger this offseason.\n\nThat leaves the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who have been pretty silent on the future of Todd Bowles, though he believes he deserves a shot at another season. After seeing the offense and defense regress and failing to take control of a division that was clearly up for grabs, perhaps the Buccaneers are a team that’s silently pondering a change.\n\nIn any event, this unknown team is operating in the shadows. But quietly, they’re likely hoping Harbaugh says yes to them before moving on from the coach they’re already committed to.\n\nWith Harbaugh shaking things up, could there soon be eight NFL head coaching vacancies, leaving a quarter of the jobs up for grabs? Would that then spur someone like Bill Belichick’s interest?\n\nBill Belichick Addresses Rumored Interest in NFL Head Coaching Vacancies\n\nNY Giants Must Stop Flirting With Kevin Stefanski, Hire John Harbaugh Right Now\n\nNew York Giants Spending Lots of Time With Top Coaching Candidate",

By ground, No. 38 broke off 131 rushing yards and a pair of visits to the end zone. By air, he added 22 receiving yards and another score on a sluggo route.\n\nLongs of 56 and 35 yards were among them for Stevenson. The starting back would be the lone player around the league to log three touchdowns from scrimmage in Week 18. He finished with 104 rushing yards over expectation, per Next Gen Stats, and was charted by Pro Football Focus for forcing four missed tackles on his handoffs.\n\nIt marks the first weekly honor for the No. 120 overall pick in the 2021 NFL draft. A former transfer from Cerritos College to the University of Oklahoma, Stevenson checks in as the first Sooners product to win AFC or NFC Offensive Player of the Week this campaign. He joins nine-time winner Adrian Peterson and four-time winner Joe Mixon in the school’s archives at running back.\n\nBetween all three phases, Stevenson is also the sixth different member of the Patriots to get such a call this season.\n\nThe conference’s No. 2 seed was previously represented by kickoff returner Antonio Gibson in Week 2, punt returner Marcus Jones in Week 4, outside linebacker K’Lavon Chaisson in Week 7, kicker Andy Borregales in Week 12 and quarterback Drake Maye in Week 13.\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers visit head coach Mike Vrabel’s group in Foxborough on Sunday.

    "fullText": "Welcome to week 18’s edition of the Cyclone tracker! (The last one, shockingly, week one feels like yesterday.)\n\nThis is where we have followed our resident weather-themed duo in rookie receivers Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel, both out of Iowa State (hence, the “Cyclone” twins).\n\nAs always, there will be analysis, projections, commentary, and relevant updates that happen in real time.\n\nProjected Week 18 storm path: 4.0 targets, 2.5 receptions, 35.5 yards, 1.1 TD, 12.5 fantasy points\n\nActual Week 18 path: 5 targets, 2 receptions, 23 yards (11.5 avg.), 1 TD, 10.3 fantasy pts\n\nTotal stats through Week 18: 68 targets, 41 receptions, 525 yards (12.8 avg.), 6 TDs, 129.5 fantasy pts\n\nAnalysis: In the second quarter of Sunday’s season finale matchup vs. the Indianapolis Colts, Higgins caught his sixth touchdown pass of the season in the corner of the end zone to give the Texans a 13-10 lead.\n\nOn 1st and 10, around the 12-yard line of the Indianapolis Colts, Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud took the snap and rolled to his left on a play-action play design to find Higgins for the toe-drag reception for the score.\n\nWith his six scores, Higgins is now second to only wide receiver Tank Dell (7) for most receiving touchdowns for a rookie in Texans history.\n\nJayden Higgins with what should’ve been his 2nd TD of the game. Guy is going to be a stud.\nDynasty Buy while he’s still cheap \n pic.twitter.com/10ikS27y9E\n\n— Jeff Mueller, PT, DPT (@jmthrivept) January 4, 2026\n\nEven though Higgins’ use has been volatile throughout the course of the season, he has still found ways to be impactful in the limited opportunities afforded to him.\n\nOn the team, he currently ranks:\n\n2nd in yards per reception average – 12.8\n\nT-1st in receiving touchdowns – 6\n\nLongest catch of the year – 75 yards\n\n3rd in receiving 1st downs – 28\n\nHiggins is a big-play waiting to happen, and that bodes well for the Texans’ chances as they head into their AFC Wildcard matchup vs. the Pittsburgh Steelers on MNF.\n\nAFC Wildcard statistical projection: 5.0 targets, 2.5 receptions, 35.5 yards, 1.1 TD, 12.5 fantasy points\n\nProjected week 18 storm path: 3 targets, 2.0 receptions, 12.5 yards, 0.1 TD, 9.7 fantasy points\n\nActual week 18 path: 1 target, 1 reception, 13 yards, 0 TDs, 7 ret, 181 return yards (26.0 yd avg.), 2.3 fantasy pts\n\nTotal stats through week 18: 35 targets, 26 receptions, 292 yards (11.2 yd avg.), 1,134 return yards, 2 TDs, 53.3 fantasy pts\n\nAnalysis: Similar to Higgins, Noel has struggled to receive a healthy volume of receiving reps throughout the 2025 season. Regardless of why, Noel was limited in his usage in the passing attack. However, Noel’s impact on special teams was felt almost every week. Specifically, it was in his kick and punt return proficiency.\n\nHe finished 13th in the NFL in kick return yards (799) and seventh in punt return yards (335, most for a rookie in franchise history).\n\nNoel has shown himself to be a field-flipper in open space, which has contributed to Houston’s special teams unit being such a weapon throughout the regular season.\n\nWhen he has been on the field for offense, Noel has caught passes for chunk yardage against various defenses, such as the Seattle Seahawks, San Francisco 49ers, and now the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nIt would be advantageous for the Texans to try and bottle up the flashes that Noel has shown in small sample sizes and attempt to take it on the road with them to Pittsburgh for the AFC Wildcard round.\n\nI.

But he is far from a finished product with his lack of counters and finesse in his game, but he still wins consistently with a straight line power bull rush that is the quickest route to the QB by collapsing the pocket. Heading into December he was in the top 40 of my initial Big Board Top 100. However a week later he was arrested for DWI and speeding after a 1:40am pullover by Missouri police.\n\nMizzou DE Zion Young was arrested early Saturday morning for suspicion of DWI, speeding, and failure to properly affix a license plate. He was booked and released. pic.twitter.com/QpNvydrxnJ\n\n— Under The Arch Sports (@_UTASports) December 13, 2025\n\nWith his intense and aggressive demeanor on the field also causing quite a few penalties and his prior assault misdemeanor charge, teams will have major questions for Zion Young’s personality, temperament, and off the field conduct. As a result, Young will be dropping from his top 40 spot and his grade will be lowered to a Round 2-3.\n\nZion Young | EDGE | MIZ\n\nDense, physical DE that plays with a nasty demeanor & power at every step. Creates consistent pocket push w/ length + lower body drive, strength to disengage & chase QB.\n\nGood edge setter vs the run & power to shed blocks and penetrate the backfield. pic.twitter.com/ubEEisToUE\n\n— Matt Lane (@Matty_KCSN) December 16, 2025\n\nIf Young can stay out of trouble, he will have a promising NFL future. The Colts have typically avoided players with checkered pasts, but perhaps their criteria could change in a contract year for General Manager Chris Ballard and new ownership in charge, or an investigation into Young could assuage their concerns. The Colts do need a power rusher who can set a hard edge in the run game and Young fits the bill. Should he fall in the draft, the Colts might be able to capitalize and get a value by stopping that fall. Still, the concerns about Young’s character and decision making off the field will need to be addressed by whoever takes him in the Draft, and it is hard for athletes to turn a new leaf when they start making professional money. The red flags are there, and they can be joined with yellow ones on the field.",

Throughout the year we ask questions of the most plugged-in Phillies fans and fans across the country. \n\nFree agents abound. Many names are still left on the board for teams to bring aboard their clubs, yet the negotiations continue. We know that the team is still trying to bring back J.T. Realmuto, but for some reason, the team and player have yet to reach an accord on what a proper contract should look like. Outside of that, however, we have heard little of the team being connected to other players other than Bo Bichette, which feels like a long shot.\n\nHowever, should they be pursuing someone?\n\nThese are some of the bigger names left and at least one feels inevitable in where his final destination will actually be (that being Bregman). Yet each would fit with the Phillies in an easy to conceive way. The outfield the team has projects to be rather rough around the edges while either of the infielders would probably be an upgrade over what they currently employ.\n\nEven so, there may be other players they should be going after.

    "fullText": "Former Tottenham and England forward Martin Chivers has died at the age of 80.\n\nDuring his eight years in north London, the striker scored 174 goals in 367 outings to help the club win the League Cup twice, as well as the Uefa Cup.\n\nHe also scored 13 goals in his 24 appearances for England.\n\nTottenham said: \"It is with immense sadness that we announce the passing of our legendary former striker, Martin Chivers.\n\n\"We extend our deepest sympathies to Martin's family, friends and former team-mates at this incredibly sad time.\n\n\"Rest in peace, Martin. One of the all-time greats.\"\n\nBorn in Southampton in April 1945, Chivers made his debut for his hometown club aged 17.\n\nAfter scoring 106 goals in 190 appearances for the Saints, the forward was signed by Spurs manager Bill Nicholson in January 1968 for a fee of £125,000.\n\nLater in his career, Chivers played in Switzerland and Norway either side of spells at Norwich City, Brighton and Dorchester Town, before retiring in 1983 after a brief spell at Barnet.\n\nTottenham will wear black armbands for Wednesday's match at Bournemouth.\n\nMartin Chivers was a potent combination of power, skill and marksmanship, possessing such quality that Tottenham Hotspur manager Nicholson paid a then British record £125,000 to sign him from Southampton in January 1968.\n\nNicholson already had Jimmy Greaves and Alan Gilzean at his disposal, but felt Chivers was the perfect addition and complement to the subtlety the pair provided - and so it proved as he became the Spurs spearhead.\n\nChivers was occasionally accused of lacking devil in his play, but the statistics and his successes suggest otherwise as he became a striker defenders feared, forming a formidable partnership with Gilzean.\n\nHe was a key figure in an era of success for Spurs, the high point coming when he scored a header and a magnificent 25-yard strike in the first leg of the 1972 Uefa Cup final against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux, Nicholson's side eventually winning 3-2 on aggregate over two legs.\n\nHe was the player for the big occasion, also scoring twice when Spurs beat Aston Villa 2-0 in the 1971 League Cup final at Wembley. He picked up another winners' medal in the competition two years later.\n\nChivers was a fixture in Sir Alf Ramsey's England side in the early 70s, winning 24 caps and scoring 13 goals, but his international career was left unfulfilled when they failed to qualify for the 1974 World Cup in West Germany, the striker playing in the 1-1 draw with Poland at Wembley in November 1973 that led to their exit.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "At first, the story of last night's \"NXT\" seemed to be Oba Femi notching another successful defense of the NXT Championship after he defeated TNA star Leon Slater. But that changed quickly as Femi wound up leaving the NXT Championship in the middle of the ring, a sign many took to mean that Femi was vacating the championship. While that hasn't been confirmed, Femi strongly hinted towards that himself by taking to X on Wednesday morning to post a photo of the NXT Title in the ring, accompanied by only one word; FIN.\n\nFIN 🪶 pic.twitter.com/cSzASs5QAb\n\n— Oba Femi wwe (@Obaofwwe) January 7, 2026\n\nFemi's actions strongly suggest that the two-time NXT Champion and former NXT North American Champion could be the latest \"NXT\" star to find himself called up to the main roster, following Trick Williams, Jordynne Grace, and Je'Von Evans. Several reports have suggested that WWE is also considering calling up former NXT North American Women's Champion Blake Monroe, speculation that was further fueled by Monroe's match with Thea Hail suddenly being changed during last night's show.\n\nIf Femi is vacating the NXT Championship as believed, it will end his second reign at a mere 32 days, making it the fifth shortest reign in the title's history, trailing only Karrion Kross' 4 day reign, Samoa Joe's 14 and 21 day reigns, and Dolph Ziggler's 27 day reign. It would also be only the fourth time the NXT Championship has been vacated, and the first time it was vacated willingly by the champion, as previous vacancies were forced by injuries to champions Tommaso Ciampa, Karrion Kross, and Samoa Joe.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "John Peterson beat Jordan Spieth in a playoff to win the Jones Cup in 2011. He returns for the first time this week as a reinstated amateur.",
    "fullText": "It wasn't long ago that John Peterson hated golf.\n\nHe was jealous. There was a rage inside of him, watching players he grew up competing against for years and years continue to play golf professionally while injuries derailed his career, forcing Peterson to give up the game.\n\nLittle did he know, that break is what would help him crave competition again.\n\nPeterson, now 36, won the Jones Cup in 2011, beating Jordan Spieth on the first playoff hole with a birdie to kick off the best year of his amateur career. He then won the NCAA individual title while at LSU, was named a first-team All-America selection and later that summer made the Round of 16 at the U.S. Amateur. He turned professional shortly after, but injuries to both wrists derailed his career fully in 2019 while competing on the Web.com Tour, now known as the Korn Ferry Tour.\n\nBut on Friday, Peterson will return to Ocean Forest Golf Club in Sea Island, Georgia, for the first time since his victory 15 years ago as a reinstated amateur and finally have a shot to defend his title.\n\n\"I do miss competitive golf, and you can play all the scrambles and four balls and things you want, but really don't know how good you are until you tee it up in a real event against the best amateurs in the world and see how you stack up,\" Peterson said. \"I love to compete, and that fire still burns within me to do it.\"\n\nHaven’t used this scorecard holder in 15 years. Figured this was a good time to break it back out. See you soon @jonescupinv pic.twitter.com/r4iJFwb0cP\n\n— John Peterson (@JohnPetersonFW) January 6, 2026\n\nPeterson's struggle with wrist injuries began at the Memorial Tournament in 2015. Playing with Kevin Kisner and David Lingmerth, and he recalls his right wrist feeling as if it was on fire. Just to get through rounds, he was taking eight or nine Advil to help alleviate the pain.\n\nHe had a carpel boss on his wrist, similar to a ganglion cyst, and had surgery at the end of the season to shave the bone down. He took a medical waiver and returned to play in the fall of 2016, missing more than a year.\n\nSince then, he hasn't had an issue with his right wrist, but the left one flared up in 2017. However, when playing a Web.com Tour event in Kansas City, Peterson hit a punch shot under a tree and felt immediate pain. He had tore two ligaments in his left wrist, having surgery roughly a month later. He rehabbed for seven months, but the wrist never healed.\n\nThat's when the anger and jealousy set in.\n\n\"After I got hurt, couldn't play and watched all the guys that I grew up playing against and watched them stay out there, there was a jealousy factor there,\" Peterson said. \"Like why couldn't I stay healthy, you know? Why couldn't that be me? And it took a couple years to get over that.\"\n\nPeterson made $2,725,494 over 134 events on the PGA Tour and Web.com Tour, but professional golf was in the rearview mirror. He couldn't practice like he used to, especially with a wife and four kids. He applied to be reinstated as an amateur, a process that took five years backdating to his final paycheck of at least $1,000, which came in June of 2019.\n\nGolf was an afterthought. Peterson went to work flipping homes in the Fort Worth area, where he lives, when his wife, Amanda, called him one day and said the spring on his garage door had broken. They called the company to get an estimate, and it came back for $2,200.\n\nPeterson thought that price was absurd. He felt as if he was getting scammed. They called another company and got an estimate for $1,900. Another phone call was made, and a third company quoted $900.\n\n\"At this point, I'm mad,\" Peterson said. \"I drove and wanted to meet this guy because I wanted to talk about margins and profit loss, how this business runs, and just it seemed like an absurd amount of profit margin that some of these companies were making.\"\n\nAfter about an hour-and-a-half discussion with the technician, Peterson couldn't sleep that night. His mind raced. The next day, he called back and offered a proposal: \"What if I started a company that's just honest pricing for everyone across the board? I think that'd be wildly successful, and we can market it right.\"\n\nHe started Westoplex Garage in September of 2023 and has been the owner ever since. Golf remained out of his life, but when his application to be reinstated as an amateur was accepted, thoughts of days past began creeping back into his head. In 2024, he was an amateur once again. After that time away from the game, and with other more important priorities in his life, his heart yearned for the golf course.\n\nThe jealousy was gone. The resentment faded. The spark was back.\n\n\"You have to reinvent yourself so many times in this life, and like, I've been nothing but a golfer, right? That's how I paid my bills,\" Peterson said. \"And I think it's scary for a lot of guys that were in my situation that don't have experience in anything but golf. When they get hurt or they lose their card or can't get back on tour, you know, what do I do now? Especially if you have kids and a mortgage and school and cars and all this stuff. I've talked with multiple guys that it's just scary for a lot, and it was for me too. There's just an appreciation for what I was able to do and what I possibly could do in the next couple of years.\"\n\nLast summer, Peterson advanced out of U.S. Open local qualifying at Abilene Country Club in Texas after shooting 70. In final qualifying, Peterson lost to Zac Blair on the fourth playoff hole at the Springfield Country Club qualifier to become the first alternate.\n\nHe didn't make it into the field, and Peterson ultimately played just 25 rounds in 2025, posting scores between 63 and 80 on his GHIN.\n\nThis week, he returns to competitive tournament golf for the first time in almost 7 years.\n\n\"I want to play more golf. I want to play an amateur — not a full schedule obviously because I that's just not even feasible for me — but I want to play four to five, maybe six, true, hard amateur tournaments this year, just for me to know where I stand because I love to compete and that fire still burns within me to do it,\" Peterson said.\n\nPeterson is nervous to tee it up against the best amateurs in the world, but almost qualifying for the U.S. Open last summer gave him confidence that he can compete at a high level again.\n\n\"I'd love to play well,\" he said. \"I would love to see how I react now under pressure. Like, that's what we play for, what I used to play for, at least. Yeah, if I can remember that far back, but that's I would love to do that honestly. But everything from now on is gravy. Like, I really don't have any expectations.\"\n\nThis will be the first time Peterson and his wife, Amanda, have had a \"vacation\" of sorts without kids since becoming parents more than 8 years ago.\n\nAs far as his game plan for the golf itself, he plans to fly by the seat of his pants and enjoy every second.\n\n\"If I start playing well and knocking some flags down, that'd be great. But if I don't, you know, it's not going to define me, right? I'm not a not a golfer anymore,\" you know?\" Peterson said. \"I'm a dad and a husband, and those are the things that matter. And then my employees, taking care of my employees making sure they have food, are paid. So it's just a lot more that matters than just me.\n\n\"I didn't really realize how big of a deal the Jones Cup was when I won, and it certainly turned into a worldwide exclusive, high-profile amateur event. I'm pretty proud to call myself a Jones Cup champion, and I'm really grateful for them to let me back in. I guess they don't really have past champions play, because everyone turns pro and never comes back.\"\n\nBut this week, Peterson's love for the game is back, and so is he.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Golfweek: Past champ John Peterson, 36, returns to Jones Cup as reinstated am",

    "description": "The Kansas City Chiefs could upgrade their wide receiver room by selecting Georgia State Panthers star Ted Hurst in the 2026 NFL draft.",
    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs used significant draft picks on wide receivers in recent years but need to invest in the position during the 2026 NFL draft. With Marquise Brown, Travis Kelce, JuJu Smith-Schuster and Tyquan Thornton all entering free agency, the team desperately needs another quality pass catcher capable of elevating the offense.\n\nGeorgia State Panthers wide receiver Ted Hurst is a more well-rounded receiver than Thornton and more explosive than Smith-Schuster. His 6’3”, 195 lbs. frame also separates him from existing members of the Chiefs wide receiver room. Hurst projects as a top 100 selection who should grow into a contributor by the mid-point of his rookie season.\n\nHurst explodes off the line of scrimmage and displays the agile footwork to work across the faces of cornerbacks during his release. He lacks elite speed but uses his initial burst to overtake and stack cornerbacks. While Hurst’s speed isn’t special, he succeeded in stretching the field and generating chunk gains with his long strides at Georgia State.\n\nGeorgia State WR Ted Hurst is my #1 offensive prospect from the G5. \n\n- 6’3/195 \n- goal line fade machine\n- crisp route runner with sudden deceleration\n- elusive after the catch (17 mtkl forced this year)\n- burst to stack press-man\n- good not great top gear\n- cuts routes off vs.… pic.twitter.com/LvUgymsCJO\n\n— James Foster (@NoFlagsFilm) November 15, 2025\n\nDespite being a taller receiver, Hurst sinks his hips well at the top of the route stem and executes effective cuts and route fakes. His route definition occasionally suffers on digs, but he generates natural separation on curls and comebacks.\n\nHurst regularly finds open space against zone coverage and runs his routes to precise depths to move the chains. His work against press coverage needs to improve. The Georgia native is lean and lacks the play strength to power through jams at the line of scrimmage. This makes it easier for cornerbacks to re-route him and impact the timing of the offense’s plays.\n\nHurst caught 61.1% of his contested targets over the past two years. He isn’t a bully at the catch point but tracks the ball well and makes great adjustments to secure receptions through contact. Hurst drops easier receptions due to lapses of concentration, but he dials in for contested opportunities.\n\nHurst lacks the mass and power to break tackles after the catch, but his long strides and agility make him a threat to find open space and gash defenses. He uses jump cuts and his springy footwork to evade defenders while probing for room to run.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: 2026 NFL draft scouting report: Georgia State Panthers WR Ted Hurst",

    "fullText": "Jamahal Hill still has his eyes on reclaiming the UFC light heavyweight title, but he's also contemplating a potential move up to heavyweight as well.\n\nFirst things first, the former champ wants to get his hands on fellow former titleholder Jan Blachowicz. That would be an important fight for Hill to get back on track after a three-fight skid to work his way back to a title rematch against Alex Pereira.\n\n\"He's still up there, he's still the top guy, he's still up there, so we're hunting for the top,\" Hill told The Schmo. \"We're hunting for the head of the division.\"\n\nConsidering the UFC tends to show former champs favor, Hill's path back to a title shot could be short. However, if he does successfully rebound, Pereira may not be there, as \"Poatan\" could chase history as the first three-division champion by moving up to heavyweight. Giving credit where it's due, Hill could see Pereira having success against Tom Aspinall to accomplish that feat.\n\n\"It's possible, especially after what we just seen in the last fight, Aspinall against Ciryl Gane,\" Hill said. \"You know, Ciryl Gane, how effective the jab was, and you seen how his hands – he can be out-boxed. It's a possibility for him to be out-boxed.\n\n\"I still think that's a tough one. That's a tough ask for him just for the simple fact of he's gonna grapple. He's gonna grab him. 'Poatan' has been able to defend a takedown, but he's been put down on the ground at 205. Those big guys at heavyweight, they'll just lift him. They'll be able to actually lift him. ... It's possible. All it takes is one punch.\"\n\nWhile there's a lot of uncertainty surrounding the heavyweight title picture at the moment, Hill, who may have been just puffing his chest out – or maybe not – said he may make a run at the heavyweight crown in the future.\n\n\"I have an appetite for gold as well,\" Hill said. \"I might want more than one division myself, too. We're talking about just Pereira over here, I might want a couple of divisions myself.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: Former UFC champ sees pros and cons of Alex Pereira at heavyweight",

    "title": "5 unanswered questions about the 49ers ahead of the playoffs and any potential Super Bowl run",
    "description": "Answering questions about the 49ers on offense, defense, and special teams ahead of the playoffs",
    "fullText": "After a one-year hiatus, the San Francisco 49ers return to the playoffs. The regular season has been full of rollercoaster moments. The highs include thrilling victories over the Rams and Bears, while the lows feature losing two of the best players in the league at their respective positions.\n\nWe’ve learned a lot about Kyle Shanahan this year. Despite all the injuries the offense endured throughout the season, his scheme proved it can transcend the absence of star players. The 49ers were once again prolific offensively, finishing second in schedule-adjusted efficiency and third in success rate.\n\nIf the 49ers are going to make a playoff run, it’ll need to be on the backs of their offense. The defense showed some fight in Week 18, but the depth is depleted, and the margin for error no longer exists. Any drive that doesn’t result in points is a win for Robert Saleh.\n\nExpectations reset in the playoffs. What you did for 17 games doesn’t matter. It’s about which team executes for 50 minutes. With that in mind, let’s discuss five unanswered questions about the 49ers as they enter the playoffs.\n\nLooking at various numbers daily, the ones that show the most correlation with winning are passing success rate and generating explosive plays through the air. For the season, the 49ers finished third in passing success rate, at 53.1 percent. Since Week 11, the offense remained consistent, sitting third once more at 52.8 percent.\n\nThe 49ers’ offense was below league average this season in explosive play rate through the air, ranking 20th. They were much better in the final three games, ranking third, which is encouraging coming out of the bye week. Still, over the final 10 games, on a larger sample, the Niners were 20th.\n\nWeek 18 was a prime example of how difficult offense can be when you don’t generate explosives. The 49ers did it on one drive, and they quickly marched down the field and into the red zone. Outside of that drive, it was tough sledding for the offense.\n\nI’d expect Kyle Shanahan and his coaching staff to review the Week 13 matchup between the Eagles and the Chicago Bears and watch it closely, perhaps stealing some of the concepts involving motion.. Ben Johnson windrow dressed his way up and down the field, had Philadelphia’s second-level defenders confused, and found a way to control the game, despite only one explosive passing play. It’s possible, but it won’t be easy.\n\nThere are a couple of trains of thought when it comes to fourth-down decision-making. Before we share those, there is nothing more valuable in football than possessing the ball. The best chance you have to win in this league is when you have the ball.\n\nKnowing that, teams are either uber-aggressive on fourth down because they know their offense is potent and can pick up whatever yardage they need. Then there are the coaches with elite defenses. If you know your defense is stingy, then you can afford to go for it on fourth down because you understand there is a high probability that you get the ball back.\n\nIn Week 18, Shanahan punted the ball on 4th & 2 from San Francisco’s 43-yard line. In a game like that, where every possession is so valuable, the probability of you gaining two yards, retaining the ball, and going down to score was well worth being wrong about.\n\nThere was zero indication that your defense could get a stop up to that point. The Seahawks scored on their previous drive and reached 1st & goal at the 1-yard line on their first drive. The odds that you were going to prevent Seattle from getting to the 43 were slim. Sure enough, Shanahan punted.\n\nThe result worked out, as the Seahawks missed the field goal. However, that doesn’t feel like the right way to look at it. You still didn’t score, nor did the defense stop Seattle from getting to the yard where you punted.\n\nShanahan went for it on the next fourth down. The offense needed one yard. They didn’t convert. That doesn’t mean the decision to go was incorrect. On the ensuing drive, the defense had a free run at Sam Darnold. They should have ended the possession scoreless had Dee Winters sacked Darnold. They allowed a field goal, which works.\n\nHow aggressive will Shanahan be on fourth downs in the postseason? The strength of this team is on offense. Shanahan was correct more often than not during the regular season when it came time to go for it.\n\nAlmost every team is above 50% on correct decisions now.\n\nSharp contrast to a decade ago when only a couple teams would be > 50%.\n\nLook at Carroll/Vrabel! pic.twitter.com/9Q9grE5jdK\n\n— Computer Cowboy (@benbbaldwin) January 5, 2026\n\nThe 49ers are at their best when the offense is on the field. Even against a top defense like the Eagles, keeping the offense out there on fourth downs will give them the best chance to win.\n\nSaleh will put you in a position to make a play. The 49ers are short on talent defensively, but that doesn’t excuse the mental mistakes or missed tackles. The Niners had 23 missed tackles in Week 18, leading to 272 yards after contact.\n\nA.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith aren’t known for being YAC merchants, but they’re not easy to get on the ground. Neither is Dallas Goedert. Saquon Barkley had 759 yards after contact this season. The Eagles have playmakers who can make you look silly.\n\nThe 49ers’ secondary will be put in a position, time after time, in the playoffs to make a 1-on-1 tackle. Malik Mustapha has a broken+missed tackle percentage of 26 percent, which is the 18th-highest among all defensive backs in the NFL. Deommodore Lenoir sits at 22.8, and Ji’Ayir Brown is 22.2 percent.\n\nIt’s problematic when both of your safeties and the corner that you put in cloud coverage as the primary force defender are consistently missing tackles. That’s not on Saleh when his players are whiffing. He can’t tackle for them.\n\nYou can control tackling. It wouldn’t be surprising if the Niners started Eric Kendricks and Kyzir White this Sunday. Since Fred Warner went down, missed tackles at linebacker have been problematic. The Eagles’ offense has been bogged down all year. The last thing Saleh’s unit can afford to do is give them extra chances and free yards because of missed tackles.\n\nSeattle went 6-for-13 on third down, but went 0-for-3 in the red zone in Week 18. The Bears went 6-for-12 on third down, but were 1-for-3 in the red zone. The Colts were 5-for-10 on third downs and scored a touchdown on both of their red zone trips.\n\nTeams have no issues moving the ball on the 49ers’ defense. That’s been a given all season. The postseason success will come down to whether Saleh’s unit can get off the field on third downs or force field goals in the red zone.\n\nFor the season, the 49ers were 10th in opponent red zone touchdown scoring percentage at 53.7 percent and 50 percent during the final ten games. They were 21st in opponent third-down conversion rate, one spot behind the Eagles.\n\nIt comes back to possessing the ball. Your offense needs to be on the field. One way the 49ers’ defense can keep the offense in the game is by holding their opponent to three points or forcing a third-down stop before they reach field-goal range. It doesn’t have to be the majority of the time, either. A 40 percent third-down rate allowed should be plenty good.\n\nIn Week 18, Jake Moody missed a 24-yard field goal after doinking a kick off the upright. Eddy Pineiro’s one miss came at the end of the half from nearly 60 yards. Pineiro’s near-perfection will come in handy this postseason.\n\nThe 49ers’ opponent’s kicking percentage should also benefit them. Last year, teams kicking against the 49ers made 96 percent of their kicks. This season, it’s been a league-low 66.6 percent — nearly six percentage points better than the team in second place.\n\nThe 49ers finished the season ranked 13th in special teams DVOA. The Eagles were 24th. Thanks to Skyy Moore and Brian Robinson, San Francisco was fifth in kickoff returns. Flipping the field once in a playoff game would be huge for multiple reasons.\n\nSurprisingly, the Niners lead the league in hidden points on special teams. It’s something that has been dragging the team down, arguably every season under Shanahan. But this year it’s been one of the biggest strengths on a 12-win team.",

Whose playoff schedule is the hardest? That's what we're gonna find out.\n\nLet's start with the softest paths to the Super Bowl in each conference. And because the obvious answer is \"the team that got the bye,\" let's exclude the Seahawks and Broncos.\n\nThe Rams missed out on a bye by giving up one of 2025's least likely comebacks in a Week 16 loss to the Seahawks. Their punishment? A trip to face the only team in this year's playoff field with a losing record and a point differential roughly on par with the Miami Dolphins. Los Angeles gets to face the league's 22nd-ranked defense and an offense led by Bryce Young. Young, despite his improvements, failed to crack the top 25 among starters when it came to:\n\nand ranked 25th in interception rate. That is balm for a burned defense. Sure, the Rams had a six-game winning streak snapped in Charlotte as a 10-point favorite this fall, but that was on a sloppy, rainy day that provided head coach Sean McVay a blueprint of what not to do in a game that matters.\n\nNext up, if all the top seeds win in Wild Card weekend, would be a game against the Seahawks -- a team the Rams split their season series against thanks to a late implosion in that aforementioned come-from-ahead less. LA would face off against Sam Darnold, who has faded down the stretch in each of his last two otherwise remarkable seasons.\n\nThe NFC title game could feature a showdown against a Niners team the Rams beat by 16 on the road (but lost to in overtime at home) or against Caleb Williams and the Chicago Bears. Williams excels against the blitz but struggles with pressure generated by a four-man front. Los Angeles has a top-five pressure rate and a bottom-four blitz rate. It should be able to contain the Bears' late-game surges.\n\nThe Patriots have the top non-bye seed in the AFC. Week 18 delivered them from an early rematch with a Buffalo Bills team that beat them in Gillette Stadium four weeks earlier, erasing a 21-0 deficit in the process.\n\nInstead, they get to face Justin Herbert, author of one of the most crushing postseason defeats in Los Angeles Chargers history (a franchise well versed in them). Los Angeles is a different team than the one that allowed Jacksonville to rally back from a 27-0 deficit in 2023, but Justin Herbert, 0-2 in the playoffs, remains.\n\nHerbert is better than his record suggests and is bolstered by a dominant defense. But he lost last year's postseason opener thanks in part to a Houston pass rush that pressured him on one-third of his dropbacks. The Patriots have generated pressure on 35 percent of passing plays this winter and have Milton Williams back in the lineup to create chaos from the middle of the line. So when LA's backup tackles collapse, Herbert -- more pressured in 2025 than ever in his career -- won't be able to step up in the pocket and create magic.\n\nNext likely comes a date in Foxborough with the Jaguars, Steelers or Bills. Any would be a tough out, but New England has handled Buffalo before. The Steelers have a one-man receiving corps that plays nicely into Christian Gonzalez's presence on the boundary. Jacksonville, as good as its been, is prone to glitching. So is the Denver offense with Bo Nix, which leaves the possibility of a throwback to the Tom Brady days and a home game with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line.\n\nHonorable mention here belongs to those Jaguars, who are riding an eight-game win streak and get to face a Buffalo Bills team that's been uneven throughout 2025 and has few reliable targets to offer Josh Allen. But they still have Josh Allen, which makes their Wild Card matchup at least 40 percent terrifying.\n\nNow let's take a look at the teams with the hardest paths to Super Bowl 60.\n\nThe Packers came into Week 18 knowing they were set to face a team against whom they'd already lost. Thus, we were subjected to Clayton Tune and the worst up-the-middle run in modern NFL history.\n\nThe good news was they managed to avoid a date with the Philadelphia Eagles, who they have not beaten in the Jordan Love era (0-4 if you count his 2022 play in relief of Aaron Rodgers). The bad news is they have to face the Bears, an arch rival in search of their first playoff win since 2010 and eager to upend the franchise that's embarrassed them for the bulk of the last three decades.\n\nGreen Bay split the season series with Chicago but gave up a 10-point lead in the final two minutes at Soldier Field in a game that effectively decided the AFC North champion in Week 16. Jordan Love will be back at full strength after missing most of that matchup with a head injury. Micah Parsons will not, due to a torn ACL. That's a problem.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Williams' passer rating jumps from 83.0 to 104.5 when biltzed. He's also significantly worse when pressured, which suggests he's identifying blitzes, finding open spaces and making quick decisions for easy gains. Without Parsons as a phantom able to crash the pocket from anywhere, the Packer defense has struggled to consistently generate pressure; in their last three games their pressure rate has fluctuated from 40 to 24 to 44 percent.\n\nIf the Packers start sending extra pass rushers on third down, Williams is equipped to handle it. Next up would be the Seattle Seahawks. While we touched on Darnold's late-season struggles, it's also worth noting he's *also* stable against the blitz (his expected points added per dropback rise from 0.05 to 0.08). Green Bay knew it needed to generate a pass rush without blitzing to take down the NFC's best quarterbacks. That's why they traded two first round picks and Kenny Clark for Parsons.\n\nTough break. Especially for a team that cannot possibly host a playoff game this January.\n\nBuffalo is a slight favorite in Jacksonville in the Wild Card, which is a reflection on the Jaguars' past rather than their current status. The Bills depleted secondary has to take on Trevor Lawrence, winner of eight straight games and the league's third-best quarterback (behind Drake Maye and Jordan Love) in terms of EPA per dropback in that stretch (24 total touchdowns, six turnovers). In that same span, the Bills' pass defense has been solid (seventh-best) but its run defense has been awful (29th), giving Jacksonville plenty of leverage should its incredible quarterback sputter.\n\nIf the top seeds hold serve aside from the Jags, a date with the Denver Broncos swarming-but-somehow-underwhelming defense awaits. That group only ranks eighth in total defensive efficiency, but has Patrick Surtain II in the secondary to erase whomever gets the call to be Josh Allen's top target in the Divisional Round. Is Keon Coleman gonna go out there and draw interference flags on Riley Moss? Josh Palmer? Tyrell Shavers?\n\nAllen will have to take matters into his own hands against a defense that's only allowed 18.3 rushing yards per game to quarterbacks in 2025. Go further down the line in a potential AFC title game and you've got an awful run defense matched up against overperforming tailbacks like Rhamondre Stevenson, Jaylen Warren or the Chargers' young duo of Omarion Hampton and Kimani Vidal.\n\nThe Bills can absolutely make it to the Super Bowl because Josh Allen is a Ford F-150 some trickster god made human. But it's going to require some unheralded players to step up and flesh out his passing game while producing the run stops that force opponents into third-and-long situations. Otherwise, the rest of the AFC is built to poke holes in Buffalo's latest playoff hopes.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Who has the easiest, toughest paths to Super Bowl 60?",

    "fullText": "As the Ravens embark on their first coaching search in 18 years, the primary challenge will be to find someone who can get more out of a generational talent who has a finite number of prime years remaining.\n\nQuarterback Lamar Jackson, who turns 29 today, will loom over the process. To the extent there was friction between Jackson and former coach John Harbaugh, the Ravens need a coach who will blend harmony with accountability.\n\nIt's easy to see how Harbaugh could have become frustrated with Jackson. From reported concerns about diet and conditioning to a habit of skipping the offseason program (Jackson gave up $1.5 million between 2024 and 2025 by staying away from most of the \"voluntary\" work) to a possible perception that he has been reluctant to play when injured (frankly, no player with unsettled contract situations should put themselves at risk), there were various reasons for a disconnect.\n\nRegardless of whether it got to the point where owner Steve Bisciotti felt compelled to choose between Jackson and Harbaugh, Harbaugh is gone and Jackson remains.\n\nJackson is under contract for two more years. There have been indications that he believes it's time for an adjustment to the five-year, $52.5 million deal he signed in 2023. (The market has increased since then, as it always does, and he has won one MVP award and finished second in the voting for another.)\n\nUnless they find a trade partner (which seems unlikely), they need to make it work with Jackson. Which means they need a coach who'll make it work with Jackson.\n\nWill that mean involving Jackson directly in the search? If nothing else, there's value in observing how Jackson and the candidates interact.\n\nObviously, Jackson would first have to want to be involved. And if he does want to be involved and the team declines, that would create another set of issues.\n\nThe quarterback can't have too much power. He also can't be treated like any other player. Jackson's contract and his skillset give him a level of influence that can't be ignored. If Jackson is all in with the new coach, other players will follow his lead. If he isn't, other players will sense it.\n\nRegardless of how it plays out, the next coach of the team will need to connect with Jackson. The next coach will need to be able to win Jackson's respect, and to inspire him to fully commit to the process of preparing himself for the next season. Starting with full participation in the offseason program, and collection of his $750,000 workout bonus for 2026.",

    "fullText": "The search for the Pittsburgh Steelers’ quarterback of the future may soon gain another intriguing option.\n\nWith 42-year-old Aaron Rodgers nearing the twilight of his decorated career, the Steelers are widely expected to explore long-term solutions at quarterback this offseason, whether through free agency or the draft. On Tuesday, one potential answer officially entered the conversation when Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson announced via Instagram that he will declare for the 2026 NFL Draft after his first season as the Crimson Tide’s full-time starter.\n\nSimpson authored a standout campaign at Alabama, leading the SEC in completions (305) while throwing for 3,567 yards and accounting for 30 total touchdowns to just five interceptions. He guided the Crimson Tide to their first College Football Playoff victory since 2021 with a win over Oklahoma, though his postseason run ended on a sour note after he struggled and exited with an injury in Alabama’s quarterfinal loss.\n\nTy Simpson was super active pre-snap v. LSU. His pre-snap recognition was a consistent strength.\n\nSenses the impending blitz here. As soon as he sees the nickel coming, he knows the safety spacing is too wide to account for the sit route inside the slot fade. Places it perfectly. pic.twitter.com/7OAkE2g4QX\n\n— Ian Cummings (@IC_Draft) November 11, 2025\n\nDespite that setback, Simpson’s draft stock remains strong. ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. currently ranks Simpson as the No. 3 quarterback in the incoming class, slotting him behind Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza and Oregon’s Dante Moore — both of whom are competing in the College Football Playoff semifinals and have yet to officially declare.\n\nGiven Pittsburgh’s likely draft position, the Steelers are not expected to be realistic contenders for Mendoza or Moore, making Simpson an especially compelling name to watch as draft season approaches. His blend of production, poise, and experience against elite competition has already sparked conversation around Pittsburgh as the organization evaluates succession plans behind Rodgers. There are, however, concerns about his lack of experience and durability.\n\nThe timing only adds to the intrigue. The 2026 NFL Draft will be held in Pittsburgh, placing the franchise firmly in the national spotlight as it navigates one of the most consequential roster decisions of the coming era.\n\nWhether Simpson ultimately becomes the next quarterback to don black and gold remains to be seen. But as the offseason begins to take shape, his declaration ensures the Steelers — and their fans — will be paying close attention.",

    "fullText": "Eredivisie giants Ajax are considering a winter loan move for Manchester United midfielder Manuel Ugarte, according to Voetbal International.​\n\nUgarte joined United from Paris Saint-Germain for around €50 million in the summer of 2024, but struggled for a consistent starting role in England.\n\nHe has started only six of United’s twenty Premier League matches this season, a limited role that has pushed him to seek more regular minutes.\n\nWhile Ugarte is open to moving to Amsterdam on a temporary basis, his salary remains a stumbling block given Ajax’s current wage structure.\n\nAny loan deal would therefore have to be with Manchester United continuing to cover a significant portion of his wages, and this will require tough negotiations between the clubs.\n\nUgarte is contracted to United until 2029 and is also attracting interest from other clubs, including Turkish giants Galatasaray, which means Ajax will face competition if talks progress.​\n\nAjax are in the market for a defensive midfielder, and while Ugarte is considered a serious short-term option, the Eredivisie giants are also keeping an eye on long-term solutions.\n\nMeanwhile, alongside Ugarte, Daley Blind is also viewed as another potential addition.\n\nWith Blind’s Girona contract expiring in the summer, any January transfer will be expected to come at a modest fee.\n\nAjax see the Dutch veteran as a cost-effective option who could contribute on the pitch and later transition into a mentoring or off-field role in Amsterdam.​\n\nAfter a horrid spell between September 30 and November 25, when Ajax won just one of 10 matches across all competitions, De Godenzonen have won six and drawn one of their subsequent seven games.\n\nHowever, they remain a whopping 16 points shy of PSV Eindhoven in the title race.",

    "description": "Jason Logan's NFL Wild Card Weekend Underdog predictions are backing the Bears and Steelers.",
    "fullText": "The NFL Playoffs have been ripe with underdog winners in recent years. Over the last five postseasons, playoff pups cover the spread at a 60% clip.\n\nThe Wild Card Round used to be one of the best slates to take the points. However, the “Super” Wild Card Weekend – with six games on the board instead of four - has been “Super Mild” in terms of underdog success.\n\nIn the seven playoffs before stretching the field to 14 teams, Wild Card dogs were 19-8-1 ATS – a 70% ATS windfall. Since expanding the bracket, pups have barely barked at 16-14 ATS over the last five postseasons.\n\nWith the field a little “watered down,” you can’t just blindly bag up all the underdogs and hope for the best. You must be more selective when it comes to taking the points with your NFL Wild Card picks and predictions.\n\nHere are my best underdog NFL picks for this year’s “Super” Wild Card Weekend.\n\nRegular season: 31-21-2 ATS (+6.73 units)\n\nBest bet: Chicago Bears +1.5\n(-120 at Caesars Sportsbook)\n\nThe Chicago Bears backed into the postseason on a two-game slide but were playing their best football down the stretch. The offense, more specifically, has looked great.\n\nThis is a Top-5 attack in terms of EPA per play since Week 12, with a two-headed monster forming at running back (D’Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai) and really giving Ben Johnson’s playbook dimension.\n\nChicago grinded for 99 yards or more on the ground in the six games before Week 18’s flop against the Lions, topping 130 rushing yards in four of those games, including 138 and 150 yards in two matchups with the Green Bay Packers.\n\nThe Packers’ once-mighty defense has been decimated by injuries, most notably along the defensive line. Green Bay has been bullied in the trenches, watching foes roll for a 48% success rate per handoff since Week 12 (31st). It’ll get pushed around by Chicago’s elite offensive line, which could be the best in the NFC.\n\nWinning the \"turf war\" makes life easier for everyone in Chitown.\n\nThose ground gains set up for shorter third downs, activate Johnson’s vaunted play-action schemes, make the Packers’ soft secondary vulnerable to random deep shots, and chew up possession, which then boosts the Bears defense and forces Green Bay to be one-dimensional with limited offensive touches.\n\nBest bet: Pittsburgh Steelers +3.5\n(-110 at BetRivers)\n\nRegardless of how they got there, the Pittsburgh Steelers are in the playoffs.\n\nThe Steelers are hosting a Houston Texans team in one of the toughest venues in all of sports. Acrisure Stadium will undoubtedly be loud and cold, with temperatures that “feel like” sub-freezing on Monday night.\n\nThe Texans are all about that defense, entering the postseason with the top-ranked stop unit in the land. But to cover the spread, you need to put some points on the board. That’s been challenging for C.J. Stroud & Co. – at least when venturing into the great outdoors.\n\nHouston averages less than 22 points per game in open-air venues and only 19.8 per road game – a 7.5-point slide compared to its production at home. Stroud is notoriously an “indoor cat,\" with his career passer rating, completion percentage, and yards per attempt all taking a nosedive outside.\n\nThe Texans’ offensive line is still an area of concern. While Houston has better protected Stroud this season, this group is still 21st in pass block win rate at ESPN, 22nd in pass block rating at PFF, and has allowed Stroud to feel pressure on almost 22% of dropbacks with the 12th most QB hurries allowed.\n\nPittsburgh’s bread and butter has always been chaos. That comes in the form of a pass rush that brings the blitz at the fourth-highest rate and sits Top 10 in both QB hits and sacks.\n\nStroud’s passing performances take a knock versus blitz-heavy schemes, with less time for deeper plays to develop. Houston went just 4-4 ATS as a visitor and, of course, you can't discount Mike Tomlin as a home underdog: 23-9-3 ATS since 2007 (70%).\n\nMy NFL Underdogs column is 31-21-2 ATS this season for +6.73 units.\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "description": "TCU led by as many as 16 in the second half.",
    "fullText": "Despite leading by as many as 16 points in the second half against the 22nd-ranked Kansas Jayhawks, the TCU Horned Frogs walked off the floor with a loss after a myriad of late-game blunders proved costly.\n\nTCU played like the better team for roughly 35 of the 45-minute-long overtime contest, setting the tone from the opening tip. Kansas struck first, but the Frogs quickly seized control behind a Jayden Pierre three-pointer. A Bryson Tiller layup briefly put the Jayhawks back in front with 15:14 remaining, though the lead lasted just 10 seconds before Xavier Edmonds knocked down a triple to give TCU the edge once again.\n\nThe Horned Frogs held the advantage for most of the first half and didn’t relinquish it until the 1:50 mark, when Darryn Peterson scored at the rim. A Tre White bucket followed by two more points from Peterson sent Kansas into the break with a five-point cushion. If there was any silver lining, it’s that the Frogs shot just 32 percent compared to the Jayhawks’ 54 percent mark from the floor in the first half and were still just down by five.\n\nhalftime#GoFrogs pic.twitter.com/1jb2Dp2KKq\n\n— TCU Men's Basketball (@TCUBasketball) January 7, 2026\n\nKansas’ lead, however, didn’t last long. TCU came out of halftime on fire, scoring the first six points of the half to take a one-point lead with 17:54 remaining. The Jayhawks answered to regain the advantage, and the two teams went back and forth, combining for 17 points in a two-minute stretch.\n\nBut after a Peterson and-one, TCU began its second-half takeover. With Kansas clinging to a 50–49 lead, the Horned Frogs rattled off 10 straight points to open up a nine-point cushion.\n\n10-0 run after a three by JP!\nLargest lead of the game for the Frogs!\n\nTCU 59 – KU 50 | 13:22 2H#GoFrogs pic.twitter.com/1ORVqz9aq2\n\n— TCU Men's Basketball (@TCUBasketball) January 7, 2026\n\nBetween an efficient offense and a clamping defense, TCU built a 16-point advantage by the 11:32 mark and appeared to be firmly in control, maintaining a double-digit lead over the next eight minutes. That control began to slip around the four-minute mark. Leading by 13, the Horned Frogs shifted into keep-away mode rather than continuing to attack, and as Kansas increased the pressure, the points began to pour in.\n\nThe Jayhawks cut the deficit to three following a Melvin Council Jr. and-one with just over 30 seconds remaining. After getting the ball back, Brock Harding was fouled but missed the front-end of a one-and-one in the final minute for the second straight time. Kansas then missed a game-tying three before fouling Liutauras Lelevicius, who knocked down both free throws to give TCU a five-point lead with 12 seconds to play.\n\nOn the ensuing possession, Flory Bidunga converted a tip-in to pull Kansas within three. With five seconds left, Harding’s inbounds pass intended for David Punch bounced out of bounds—a call that stood despite a Jamie Dixon challenge. Kansas inbounded from TCU’s side of the floor, finding Bidunga on a skip pass, who then dished to Peterson with two seconds remaining. As Peterson launched a desperation heave, Jace Posey reached in and fouled him, sending the potential No. 1 overall pick to the line. Peterson calmly drained all three free throws to tie the game.\n\nWith 1.7 seconds left and no timeouts remaining, Harding launched a Hail Mary in search of a last-second look, but the pass was airmailed. Kansas got one final chance to win it, but Peterson’s open three rimmed out, sending the game to overtime.\n\n— TCU Men's Basketball (@TCUBasketball) January 7, 2026\n\nWith Allen Fieldhouse rocking, the Jayhawks began overtime with the upper hand. Even without Peterson, who watched from the sidelines with wraps around both quads, Kansas took an early lead and never relinquished it. The Jayhawks pushed ahead by six with 1:07 remaining, but TCU wasn’t finished. Pierre’s three-pointer cut the lead to three, and after a White dunk, Harding hit another triple to make it a two-point game by the 33-second mark.\n\nCouncil Jr. was fouled and made only one of two free throws, giving the Horned Frogs a chance to tie at 100. However, a bad inbound pass from Pierre was intercepted by Council Jr., who sank both free throws to extend Kansas’ lead to five. Pierre added another three-pointer to cut it to two, but Kansas made two more free throws with under 10 seconds left to seal a 104–100 victory, avoiding a 0–2 start in the Big 12.\n\nFINAL: NO. 22 Kansas 104 – TCU 100 (OT)\n\nWe'll be back in action at home on Saturday at 3 p.m. against No. 1 Arizona. #GoFrogs\n\n— TCU Men's Basketball (@TCUBasketball) January 7, 2026\n\nThe Jayhawks shot 52 percent from the field, 40 percent from three-point range, and made 30 of 40 free throws en route to 104 points. TCU was 47 percent from the floor and hit a season-high 15 three-pointers at 43 percent.\n\nPeterson led the Jayhawks with 32 points in 32 minutes, going 8-of-18 from the floor and scoring most of his points from the free throw line (13-of-15). White added 22, while Council Jr. contributed 18 points, six rebounds, and eight assists.\n\nTCU had five players reach double figures, led by Lelevicius’s career-high 23 points. Punch recorded 20 points, nine rebounds, and five blocks but struggled from the free throw line, making just 4-of-9 attempts. Pierre and Robinson each added 16 points, while Edmonds scored 11 before fouling out.\n\nNext up, TCU will return to Fort Worth to host the No. 1 Arizona Wildcats on Saturday, January 10 at 3:00 p.m. CT.",

    "fullText": "After a series of speculations, Barcelona have finally made a breakthrough in the deal to sign Joao Cancelo.\n\nThe Portuguese international is set to join Barcelona on a short-term loan deal worth €5 million, as confirmed by Fabrizio Romano.\n\nThe Catalans are planning to announce the Cancelo deal later this week, having reached an agreement with Al Hilal.\n\nFurther confirmation of Cancelo’s move to Barcelona came from Al Hilal coach Simone Inzaghi today.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the team’s upcoming game against Al Hazm, the Italian coach confirmed Cancelo is not in his plans anymore and that the club are working on resolving his future.\n\n“Cancelo is not in our plans and the club is working on it,” said Inzaghi (h/t Mundo Deportivo).\n\nThis is yet another indicator that the former Juventus star is indeed rejoining Barcelona, and the deal could be finalised soon.\n\nCancelo will soon be on his way to Barcelona. (Photo by Octavio Passos/Getty Images)\n\nInterestingly, Inzaghi’s former team, Inter Milan, were interested in the services of Cancelo as well and had even reached an agreement with Al Hilal. But the player had his heart set on a return to Barcelona.\n\nCancelo, in fact, has big plans upon his impending return to Barcelona, as he wants to stay at Camp Nou beyond the end of the season.\n\nSuch a move would depend on Barcelona’s relationship with Al Hilal, who have shown interest in signing Raphinha and have already tabled a bid worth €100 million.\n\nA potential Al Hilal move for Raphinha would certainly pave the way for the Saudi giants to release Cancelo.\n\nHowever, such a deal would depend entirely on the Brazilian international, who will be allowed to move on due to a gentleman’s agreement between him and Deco.",

    "fullText": "At or near the top of any head coaching candidate list this offseason is Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak. The son of former longtime NFL coach Gary Kubiak has guided new QB Sam Darnold and the Seahawks to the top seed in the NFC. And the Raiders have landed an interview with him as their fourth head coach interview this week.\n\nThe #Raiders will interview:\n-- #Broncos QBs coach Davis Webb tonight.\n-- #Chiefs OC Matt Nagy on Thursday.\n-- #Broncos DC Vance Joseph on Thursday.\n-- #Seahawks OC Klint Kubiak on Friday. Kubiak has three other requests, as well and Friday and Saturday appear to be the days.\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 7, 2026\n\nWhat three of the Raiders upcoming interviews have in common in they're all from the two top seeded teams in their respective conferences. That's because those teams have a bye and therefore their in-demand assistants are available this week for interviews.\n\nIt's a big win for the Raiders to even land an interview with Kubiak. You might recall last offseason, there were a couple head coach candidates they really liked who opted not to even interview with the team. Those coaches were Ben Johnson (Bears) and Mike Vrabel (Patriots), both of whom led their teams to the playoffs in their first year on the job.\n\nMany believe Kubiak is the ideal head coach candidate for the Raiders. The offense in Las Vegas needs a serious boost. The kind of boost Kubiak gave the Seattle offense in his first season there. Not to mention what he was able to get out of Darnold considering the Raiders are about to take a QB atop of April's draft.\n\nKubiak is a rising star in the coaching ranks and if the Raiders don't hire him, someone else likely will.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Raiders Wire: Raiders schedule interview with hot name OC from top seed Seahawks",

    "description": "The Atlanta Falcons are predicted to hire a former Coach of the Year winner to replace Raheem Morris, who they fired after the conclusion of the 2025 season.",
    "fullText": "Falcons predicted to hire former Coach of the Year winner to replace Raheem Morris originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Atlanta Falcons are back in the head coaching market for the second time in two years, as the franchise fired Raheem Morris on Monday after just two years.\n\nAtlanta hasn't posted a winning season since 2017, and the team has struggled to find a long-term replacement for Dan Quinn, who they fired in 2020. Arthur Smith was mediocre and lasted only three seasons, and Morris wasn't much better.\n\nThat said, Sportsnaut's Matt Johnson predicts the Falcons will kickstart a new era by hiring Kevin Stefanski as their new head coach.\n\nHere is what Johnson had to say about Stefanski and his potential fit as Atlanta's head coach.\n\n\"Stefanski would immediately inherit an offense with All-Pro running back Bijan Robinson, whom he could center his offense around, along with Pro Bowl receiving threats in Drake London and Kyle Pitts. Furthermore, he would also have the option of reuniting with Kirk Cousins and deploying him as the bridge starter to open the 2026 NFL season. While a good hire at defensive coordinator would be key, the next play-caller would get to work with a unit that boasts Jessie Bates, A.J. Terrell, James Pearce Jr., Javon Walker, Xavier Watts and Divine Deablo.\"\n\nStefanski was fired by the Browns this week after two straight losing seasons, but he was far from the biggest problem in Cleveland. The team has been handicapped at the quarterback position due to the abysmal Deshaun Watson trade, and the Browns just didn't have many offensive playmakers this season for Stefanski to succeed.\n\nAfter being let go by Cleveland, Stefanski has already garnered interest from multiple teams, including the Falcons, who are expected to speak with him.\n\n\"Sources: Former Browns HC Kevin Stefanski currently is expected to speak with the Falcons, Giants and Titans about their HC vacancies,\" ESPN's Adam Schefter reported on X on Jan. 5.\n\nWith the amount of offensive playmakers Atlanta possesses, including star running back Bijan Robinson, wide receiver Drake London, and tight end Kyle Pitts, who is set to hit free agency, it would be foolish for the Falcons not to hire an offensive coach who can get the most out of the promising unit.\n\nStefanski would be a fantastic fit in Atlanta with the set of dynamic weapons, and though the team's quarterback situation is uncertain due to Michael Penix Jr's injury and Kirk Cousins' contract, the team should be able to figure it out and at least find a bridge starter capable of contributing to winning football.\n\nOverall, Stefanski and the Falcons would be a logical fit, but Atlanta does have a ton of candidates to evaluate before ultimately making a franchise-altering decision.\n\nTravis Kelce provides update on Chiefs future amid retirement uncertainty\n\nDolphins' interest in head coach candidate is bad news for McDaniel\n\nGiants rumors from 2 insiders anoint new favorite for HC job\n\nCommanders reason for parting with Kingsbury revealed by NFL insider\n\nBrowns predicted to hire Super Bowl-winning head coach\n\nDeion Sanders predicted to bail on Colorado for HC job with AFC team",

    "fullText": "New details have emerged surrounding Demond Williams and his attempt to enter the transfer portal, shedding light on why Washington officials are refusing to process his request.\n\nAccording to Ross Dellenger of Yahoo Sports, Williams recently signed a one-year revenue-sharing agreement with the Huskies worth approximately $4 million. The agreement is a Big Ten–approved template used by all conference members and was specifically designed to address scenarios like this.\n\nThe contract evidently prohibits Williams from entering the transfer portal once signed, and restricts his NIL rights from being used by another school. He’s still allowed to pursue outside marketing deals per Dellenger.\n\nAs a result, Washington has declined to enter Williams’ name into the portal, which prevents him from holding conversations with other programs. Dellenger reported that Big Ten Conference commissioner Tony Petitti is heavily involved in the matter, along with other league officials.\n\nAdditionally, the conference is backing Washington’s firm stance. Coincidentally, Petitti is in Seattle this week for a memorial service while discussions continue.\n\nMoreover, Washington officials are expected to communicate later Tuesday with Williams’ representatives regarding next steps. The school also suspects Williams has already spoken with other programs and plans to submit any evidence of tampering to both the conference and the NCAA. LSU is believed to be the program most interested in Williams.\n\nLess than a week before announcing his intention to transfer, Williams signed the new deal at Washington, a development first reported by Pete Nakos of On3. Sources emphasized to Nakos that Williams remains under contract and that Washington expects him to be its starting quarterback in 2026 under head coach Jedd Fisch. The Huskies were also prepared to make Williams one of the highest-paid quarterbacks in college football.\n\nThe situation mirrors a similar case last year involving Wisconsin Badgers defender Xavier Lucas, who withdrew from Wisconsin and enrolled at Miami Hurricanes without entering the portal.\n\nWisconsin claimed Lucas was bound by a two-year NIL agreement and pursued legal action, with attorney Darren Heitner representing Lucas. That lawsuit remains ongoing, and Dellenger noted the language in Williams’ deal closely resembles the template used in the Wisconsin case.\n\nWilliams is coming off a standout sophomore season, throwing for 3,065 yards and 25 touchdowns while adding 611 rushing yards and six scores. In announcing his intent to transfer Tuesday night, Williams said the decision was made with his future in mind, though Washington appears prepared to enforce the contract he signed just days earlier.\n\n— On3’s Nick Schultz contributed to this article.",

Is it only when a team loses, or does a Cinderella run end when the Cinderella becomes favored?\n\nThe Miami Hurricanes have sprung two upsets already in the College Football Playoff, but they are now favored against the Mississippi Rebels in the first semifinal.\n\nMy Miami vs. Mississippi predictions and college football picks lean heavily on Cinderella, even if Cinderella is now favored.\n\nKickoff comes at 7:30 p.m. ET on Thursday, January 8.\n\nThe thought of Miami reaching the national championship game after its questionable inclusion in the College Football Playoff should make Notre Dame fans and BYU fans livid. Yet, here we are.\n\nThe Hurricanes’ defense is distinctly the best unit in this game, and it is playing at its best of the season. Meanwhile, the Rebels’ offense is losing assistants with each round of the Playoff, courtesy of former head coach Lane Kiffin.\n\nThat matchup should dictate this game, lending itself to a Miami win and a continued Cinderella-ish run.\n\nMississippi may have the best offensive line that Miami has faced yet in the Playoff, but with how defensive ends Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor are playing, that should not matter. Furthermore, Rebels quarterback Trinidad Chambliss is less of a scramble threat than Texas A&M’s Marcel Reed and less adept at getting rid of the ball under pressure than Ohio State’s Julian Sayin.\n\nExpect the Miami Hurricanes’ defensive front to make Chambliss look like a Division II quarterback while Miami’s offense enjoys facing the worst defense it has seen in the Playoff.\n\nMiami's offense might not look outright good in this matchup, but it should look better than it has yet in the Playoff. This is the worst defense it has faced thus far. Furthermore, shortening the game with a heavy dosage of Mark Fletcher Jr. will only help the Hurricanes' defensive front.\n\nMark Fletcher Jr. Over 88.5 rushing yards\n\nMalachi Toney anytime touchdown\n\nAny Miami faith should also go hand in hand with the Under. Handing off to Mark Fletcher Jr. will help keep Mississippi quarterback Trinidad Chambliss off the field; it will also keep the Hurricanes' defensive line more aggressive.\n\nMark Fletcher Jr. Over 88.5 Rushing Yards\n\nSpread: Miami -3.5 | Mississippi +3.5\n\nMoneyline: Miami -164 | Mississippi +138\n\nOver/Under: Over 51.5 | Under 51.5\n\nMiami is 2-0 against the spread this season as a one-score favorite and 4-1 ATS as a one-score favorite in the last three seasons.

    "fullText": "When John Cena tapped out during his final match on \"Saturday Night's Main Event,\" many fans were shattered — not only because Cena lost, but specifically because he submitted. However, WWE World Heavyweight Champion CM Punk thinks those fans are overreacting, and during an interview on \"My Mom's Basement with Robbie Fox,\" he expressed how he feels about the match.\n\n\"Some people maybe, I don't think you understand what you're watching, but if you didn't like it, I can also understand that,\" he said. \"To overnight make it your entire personality and spend an unhealthy amount of time talking about it? ... It's a little mental to me.\"\n\nPunk proclaimed that if Cena actually walked away with the win, fans would've still been mad and the finish would no longer be talked about, comparing it to a film like \"The Empire Strikes Back.\"\n\n\"We're still talking about that finish — the smile, the tap, 'Oh my god, the guy who said don't give up just gave up.' Did he?\" Punk said. \"Everybody's an expert. I thought it was beautiful.\"\n\nCena himself has since opened up about the way he went out in his final match, opining that fans should look at his final moment in the ring as an 'emotional injury' and him 'going peacefully.'\n\nIf you use any quotes from this article, please credit \"My Mom's Basement with Robbie Fox\" and provide a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "Arie van den Heuvel is an engineer, a System and Application Management Specialist, and a valued member of our community. You can read more of Arie’s writing and support the resource articles he has contributed to open source on his blog. If you have a story or open source project you would like to share with our community next, you can write to us.\n\nWhen running a home server consisting of one or more nodes with some or all services in Docker, you may find yourself wanting to monitor your environment. Or even better, attain full observability.\n\nThe frequent recommendation for this is a combination of Prometheus with Grafana. But this solution requires a lot of work to fully configure, in addition to work on one’s applications and setup for full visibility. Another possibility is to use the free tier of NewRelic, which has the advantage of remote insights on metrics and logs. Again, this requires additional work on containers or applications to have a more refined visibility of your services.\n\nFor those not running Linux, an honourable mention to use as a solution would be Beszel. Beszel can be run as a local service or in docker. It consists of a web front-end and an agent that can be used on multiple systems that run Windows and MacOS. Installation is an easy job in docker. Once it’s running, Beszel provides insightful information with system metrics, docker services, and even logs.\n\nMy personal choice for monitoring a home server system is Coroot. In the following blog, I’ll detail how I used Coroot to set up observability for my homelab, which you can then adopt for your own setup.\n\nIn my current setup on a Rocky Linux 9.x system, Coroot runs on a Clickhouse server to store metrics, logs, traces and profiles, in addition to the Coroot node-agent and Coroot cluster-agent. The Coroot node-agent automatically collects all service metrics and logs using eBPF, while the cluster-agent provides detailed information on databases like MySQL, Postgres or Redis.\n\nAnother advantage Coroot presents is the use of AI-powered Root Cause Analysis, which provides instantaneous and helpful insights for investigating incidents. With a Coroot Cloud account, you will have ten helpful analyses for free each month. Even without AI, the data presented with Coroot with standard alerts based on best metric practices is pretty insightful and helps to make your setup even better.\n\nCoroot services run in docker through a docker-compose file. In a normal Coroot setup Prometheus is used, but in this setup I have configured Clickhouse, which is a supported alternative.\n\nI have Clickhouse running as a local service. This setup allows for better control and convenience when scaling down memory usage of Clickhouse, scaling down logging on disk and the database, and simplifies making changes to the data. The only downside to note is this setup requires updating Clickhouse manually with yum/dnf.\n\nInstalling Clickhouse is easily achieved by adding the repo, installing Clickhouse, and making a few quick adjustments before starting it up.\n\nBefore starting the service create file /etc/clickhouse-server/config.d/z_log_disable.xml and insert the following content in the file:\n\nAfter this adjust cache sizes in /etc/clickhouse-server/config.xml:\n\nAdjust memory usage ratio in /etc/clickhouse-server/config.xml:\n\nLower the tread pool size in /etc/clickhouse-server/config.xml:\n\nFirst, check if your Linux system is using kernel 5.1 or later (although 4.2 is also supported.) This installation is different from the original docker-compose file.\n\nPrometheus is not used in this setup, and Clickhouse runs as a local service. Another distinction is the retention of the data, which is normally set to seven days for traces, logs, profiles and metrics. Coroot also typically stores its own local cache for metrics for 30 days.\n\nIn this setup, the data retention stored in Clickhouse is set up for 14 days. With eighteen local and docker services, the amount of data kept for all of this is 3GB on average in my system.\n\nCoroot, its node-agent, and cluster-agent, run as a docker service with a docker-compose that you create locally. This is achieved by inserting the following content in a locally created docker-compose.yaml:\n\nAfter creating this file and making any adjustments to your own likings and network preferences, type docker compose up -d and go to your IP address on port 8080. Here you have access to Coroot, and are now prompted to give admin credentials!\n\nIn my setup, Watchtower takes care of updating docker containers, which works great with Coroot.\n\nAs a final sidenote: there are already some helpful hints and pointers present within Coroot for setting things up. In my case, there was information available that helped observe a Postgres database. Don’t forget to use the given commands as the admin/postgres user to make it work.\n\nStop guessing, start seeing with eBPF-powered instant observability.",

    "description": "How compile-time strategies save you from exponential nightmares",
    "fullText": "You know the feeling: you start with a simple class, then someone asks “can we support an alternative strategy for X?”, so you add a parameter. Then “what about different approaches to Y?”. Okay, another parameter. “And different handlers for Z?”. And so on…\n\nFor example, consider a data processing pipeline where to have to tackle different input formats (JSON, XML, CSV), several data validation strategies (strict, lenient, custom), alternative output destinations (file, database, network), different error handling approaches (throw, log, ignore). That’s already 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 81 combinations. Add caching strategies? Now you’re at 243. And compression options? 729.\n\nBefore you know it, your innocent little class has morphed into a monster with 720 possible combinations of behaviors to test and maintain. Welcome to combinatorial hell. If you are a reasonable engineer, you will ask yourself: how to get the flexibility without the madness?\n\nLet’s say you’re building a logging system. You need to support three different formatters (plain text, JSON, XML), two output destinations (console, file), and two threading models (synchronous, asynchronous).\n\nHow many times did I hear managers, juniors, coworkers alike say things like “Easy, just make one class with parameters”:\n\nNeat. What they don’t see is that you still need to implement all the logic for every combination. Inside that method, you’ll end up with nested switches or if-statements:\n\nLook at all the nested logic: the combinatorial explosion just moved inside your function. You’re still writing and testing all 12 combinations. Plus you get runtime overhead for all those branches. I kept it simple for the blog, but the beauty of combinatorial explosion is that it rarely stays at 12. It wants to grow exponentially, unlike your maintenance linear capability or fast-decaying patience curve.\n\nAn even more naive approach would be to create a separate class for each combination:\n\nSilverlining myself, I would try to convince myself that at least the nested switches are gone. But now we have massive code duplication. That’s 12 classes already. Add one more dimension and you’re at 24. Add another and the explosion continues. And you have to refactor the class name every time you add a dimension. Not great, admittedly.\n\nBoth approaches suffer from the same fundamental problem: the dimensions are not decoupled, so you’re paying a hefty price for every combination, whether in branching logic or in duplicated code. You need to extract each behavior into fully independent components, so you can compose them. This is orthogonality, a key design principle.\n\nRemember linear algebra. With only orthogonal vectors in 3D space, any point can be expressed as a linear combination of those three vectors. You don’t need to define every possible point explicitly: you just need to combine the base vectors:\n\n$\\vec{P} = a\\vec{u} + b\\vec{v} + c\\vec{w}$\n\nThe key insight is: three orthogonal vectors give you access to infinite points in 3D space through composition, not enumeration. Software design works the same way, as each behavioral dimension should be:\n\nWhen dimensions are truly orthogonal:\n\nCompare this to the nested switch approach that explicitely handled all combinations, or the class-per-combination nightmare with massive duplication. As we add dimensions, orthogonal design scales linearly (n components) but coupled design scales exponentially. It’s a pretty big deal for maintenance, documentation and testing.\n\nFor example, if you were to add caching strategies with 3 options:\n\nThat’s the power of orthogonality: you escape combinatorial hell by making your dimensions truly independent. It’s a good, SOLID Ariadne’s thread to follow. But there are so many ways to extract, apply and compose components. How to chose?\n\nYou could simply pass options (as strings or, better, enums) to a class constructor that wraps a switch statement:\n\nThis can work, but it comes with drawbacks:\n\nIf these trade-offs work for you, then it’s a reasonable starting point.\n\nAssuming C++17 is available to you, a slight design variation could be to use if constexpr:\n\nThis approach solves two of the previous drawbacks:\n\nHowever, adding new formats still requires modifying both the enum and the function body. You can’t extend this from outside your library, and you still need to touch multiple points in the code for each new variant. The Open-Closed Principle violation remains: the code is not closed for modification.\n\nBoth the runtime switch and if constexpr approaches share a fundamental limitation: they’re still enum-based. The variants are baked into an enum, and the logic is centralized in one function. What if we could decouple the variants entirely? What if each formatter was its own independent type, composable at compile-time? This would give us true extensibility (clients can add formatters without touching your code), preserve the compile-time optimization, and eliminate the need for centralized switch logic.\n\nPolicy-based design solves this by turning behaviors into independent types rather than enum values. Each behavior becomes a self-contained class. Users can provide their own types without modifying your library. The host class takes template parameters and composes them. The compiler generates a specialized version for each combination you actually use—zero runtime overhead, full extensibility.\n\nWhy use a class to host policies rather than template functions? Classes own policy state (file handles, buffers, configuration), compose multiple policies together, and support RAII for resource cleanup. Template functions would require passing policy instances on every call, losing these benefits.\n\nThe actual cost of such decoupling is obviously less cohesion: it can be harder to find the relationship between a policy class and its host class. Concepts in C++20 help a bit to tighten them together.\n\nYou’ve been using policy-based design without realizing it. STL containers take allocators for custom memory management, std::basic_string takes std::char_traits (that’s how you’d implement case-insensitive strings), std::map takes custom comparison functions, and std::unordered_map takes custom hash functions and equality predicates. The standard library proves the design works in a user-friendly way.\n\nLet’s revisit our logging system with a policy-based approach:\n\nNo more enums, no centralized switch. Each formatter is self-contained. Want to add a new formatter? Just define a new class: no need to touch Logger or modify any enum. Users can even provide their own formatters from outside your library.\n\nThe real power emerges when you compose multiple orthogonal policies. Observe how we can extend our logger with separate formatting and output policies:\n\nNotice the orthogonality: we have 3 formatters and 3 outputs, giving us 9 possible combinations by writing only 6 independent classes. Add a third policy dimension (threading, buffering, filtering) and the composition scales linearly while your flexibility grows exponentially.\n\nLike any powerful tool, policy-based design has its place. Don’t use it when:\n\nYou might be thinking: “Inheritance and virtual functions solve this too, right?”\n\nRuntime polymorphism works great when you genuinely need runtime flexibility—like a plugin system where third-party DLLs get loaded at startup. It’s also the right choice when code bloat becomes a problem. The standard library itself demonstrates this trade-off: C++17 introduced std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator and std::pmr::memory_resource specifically to avoid generating dozens of std::vector instantiations for every allocator combination. They use virtual functions to trade a bit of performance for significantly smaller binaries.\n\nBut if your behavior choices are known at compile-time and binary size isn’t an issue, policy-based design avoids unnecessary costs:\n\nPerformance overhead: Virtual calls prevent inlining and block compiler optimizations. In high-throughput systems (web servers, message queues), this can be the difference between 10,000 and 50,000 requests per second.\n\nType information loss: With virtual functions, all formatters must return the same type. Your JSONFormatter can’t return a rich JSONObject: it’s forced to flatten everything to strings to match the base class interface.\n\nThe key is choosing the right tool: policies when you know the strategy at compile-time and performance matters, OOP when you need runtime flexibility or want to control binary size.\n\nPolicy-Based Design offers an important capability in software engineering: the ability to be flexible without paying for it. Also, keep in mind policies are unitary testable, and very mobile: I pasted them along with their tests across several projects. The atomicity of a policy compared to the complexity of an entire enum based switch is a blessing for reusability.\n\nWhether you’re building data processing pipelines, game engines, or embedded systems, you often need to explore different strategies, test different approaches, and combine behaviors in novel ways. This flexibility is essential. But your code also needs to be fast. You can’t afford to pay for flexibility you don’t use.\n\nPolicy-Based Design is a way to get both.\n\nThe compiler is your friend. Give it the information it needs (via templates) and it will generate efficient code for you. Fight the compiler (by hiding information behind runtime indirection) and you both suffer.\n\nSo next time you’re facing a combinatorial explosion of behaviors, don’t reach for inheritance and virtual functions. Don’t resign yourself to copy-pasting code. Reach for policies, let the compiler do the heavy lifting, and get back to solving your actual problem.\n\nBoost.Bloom, authored by Joaquín M López Muñoz, implements Bloom filters: space-efficient probabilistic data structures analogous to compressed databases, useful for fast membership testing. Full disclosure: I served as Review Manager when this library was accepted into Boost.\n\nBloom filters work by hashing elements and setting specific bits in an array. The hash function determines which bits get marked, and its quality affects the filter’s accuracy. A poor hash function causes collisions and false positives and a good one distributes bits uniformly. But users might bring domain-specific hashes, legacy code hashes, standard library hashes of varying quality, so the library can’t force one “good-enough” implementation on everybody.\n\nThe domain problem: Hash functions vary wildly in quality: high-quality ones produce well-distributed values that work great as-is, but poor-quality ones need additional bit mixing to avoid collisions.\n\nThe user’s need: Users with good hash functions shouldn’t pay for mixing they don’t need. Users with poor hash functions should get automatic enhancement. Checking hash quality at runtime would add overhead to every operation.\n\nThe developer’s solution: A policy family that the compiler selects based on hash traits:\n\nThe library selects the appropriate policy at compile time based on hash function traits:\n\nThe result: Users with good hash functions pay zero cost. Users with poor hash functions get automatic enhancement. No runtime checks, no virtual calls, no wasted cycles. The right strategy for your situation, decided at compile time.\n\nWant to see more?

At its core, FlashInfer Trace provides a unified schema describing kernel definitions, workloads, implementations, and evaluations, enabling consistent communication between agents and systems. Built on real serving traces, FlashInfer-Bench includes a curated dataset, a robust correctness- and performance-aware benchmarking framework, a public leaderboard to track LLM agents' GPU programming capabilities, and a dynamic substitution mechanism (apply()) that seamlessly injects the best-performing kernels into production LLM engines such as SGLang and vLLM.

    "fullText": "A critically endangered large bird is getting a helping hand with the opening of a large sanctuary on the Gulf Coast.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that the Wolfberry Whooping Crane Sanctuary will provide a vital wintering ground for the 550 cranes that migrate each winter to Texas from Canada.\n\nThe $8.4 million land acquisition was a joint venture between different conservation groups. It marks a key next step in the crane's recovery from the brink of extinction in the 1940s.\n\nThe whooping crane's numbers dipped to just 21 individuals in the wild, 16 in Texas, because of extensive destruction of wetlands and illegal hunting.\n\nRising sea levels are further eroding the crane's breeding grounds. They were one of the first species listed under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.\n\nCarter Crouch, director of the Gulf Coast programs for the International Crane Foundation, hailed the progress made while acknowledging the challenges ahead:\n\n\"We have a long way to go still, so there's a lot of story to be written, and I'm super excited to be a small part of that.\"\n\nThe whooping crane is a striking bird that typically stands about five feet tall with white feathers and a distinctive red patch on its head. Its name reveals its other defining characteristic: very loud vocalizations.\n\nLike other cranes, they play an important role in maintaining the balance of the food web in wetlands by keeping prey populations under control and spreading nutrients. They are also considered an indicator species, meaning their presence is a sign of a healthy ecosystem.\n\nWhile still in a precarious state, they are resilient birds with a long lifespan, so there's good reason to be optimistic for their future.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nAnother promising note is another rare crane's remarkable comeback on the other side of the world. It shows what's possible with effective local and international cooperation to protect threatened species.\n\nSupporting such efforts with your time or money can make a huge difference.\n\nAn Instagram post from Saving Cranes (@savingcranes) about the story garnered several positive comments.\n\n\"Great win conserving one of the earth's great habitats for wildlife for future generations!\" read one.\n\nAnother happy commenter added, \"Bravo!

    "description": "Struggling Gen Z and millennial grads should consider turning their back on their degrees and retraining to become hospitality and trade workers, Randstad’s CEO warns.",
    "fullText": "Millions of Gen Zers are facing unemployment as entry-level office roles get absorbed by AI, and millennials are regretting taking out thousands in student loans for careers that now have significantly diminished prospects. Now, the CEO of the world’s biggest talent company, Randstad, has confirmed what many young grads are already fearing: The traditional college-to-office pipeline is dead.\n\n“People need to reflect on—taking a student loan, going to college and being trained or educated for a profession that is rapidly changing—whether that’s still the right path,” Sander van ’t Noordende, the global CEO of Randstad, told Fortune.\n\n“We all grew up, with our parents saying, ‘go do something in college or university and then do something in an office,’ that path that used to work for a long time is starting to break,” he added.\n\n“You already see that with the graduates finding it harder to find a job. You see that in professions like marketing, communications, design… just look at how good AI already is at some of that.”\n\nUnder his helm, the staffing company places around half a million workers in jobs every week—and he has bad news for those who have already forked out thousands for their degree in the hopes of nabbing a cushy office role: You may have more luck landing bartending, barista, or building jobs.\n\nTech leaders have consistently warned that AI is already as good as entry-level workers and that it could halve white-collar jobs by 2030. In fact, a “first-of-its-kind” Stanford University study has warned that the new technology is already having “significant and disproportionate impact” on Gen Z. Bartenders and baristas are even seeing bigger pay raises than desk workers, right now.\n\n“Jobs will change—and are changing—but also new jobs will emerge,” van ’t Noordende echoed. “There is a massive demand in skilled trades, mechanical engineers, machine operators, maintenance engineers, forklift drivers, truck drivers—you name it.”\n\nWith the white-collar job market seemingly frozen, van ’t Noordende said it’s no longer “good advice” to tell young people to follow their passions.\n\n“No, learn a craft or a trade or a skill or a profession, where you can make a good living and provide for you and your family, is much better advice than follow your passion.”\n\nFurther making his case: The U.K. government has just announced it’ll be splurging $965 million into apprenticeships to help place tens of thousands of unemployed young people into the jobs that they think are the future—and they’re all in hospitality, retail, and AI.\n\nBut for those hell-bent on going to college, van ’t Noordende stressed that STEM subjects—which are studied in China at twice the rate of the U.S. and parts of Europe—will likely remain in demand.\n\nAnd his advice to those who’ve already wasted time and money on a degree that’s dwindling in relevance? “Retrain. Learning new skills always good.”\n\n“Look around you, and where you see the opportunities that match with your skills and your background and go there,” van ’t Noordende added. But he warned that at some point, you may just “have to bite the bullet and say, ‘Okay, this is not working.’”\n\nThe CEO stressed that you’re not alone; many people are currently doing exactly that. And that ultimately, going from a desk job to becoming a plumber, teacher, or nurse, van ’t Noordende says, requires a mindset shift. It’s not a failure if you end up doing work outside your field of study—it’s just adjusting to what actually works. “You have to come off your chair and build skills,” he added.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "A homeowner was stunned after a shocking notification from their homeowners association.\n\nThe community organization was introducing higher monthly dues to fund its legal defense costs for a suit against the homeowners themselves.\n\nAccording to the homeowner, seven households filed a lawsuit against the HOA, alleging serious mismanagement and broken promises.\n\n\"Basically we are paying more each month, so the HOA can fight against us in court,\" the original poster wrote. \"Paying for our opposition to battle us in court.\"\n\nIn follow-up comments, the homeowner outlined the reasons behind the lawsuit. They said the HOA failed to deliver basic services funded by dues, including roughly $100,000 annually earmarked for landscaping that was reportedly completed just once last year.\n\nThe HOA also allegedly gave away community land that housed tennis courts and a pool to a private company.\n\nResidents must now pay additional membership fees to use amenities they once collectively owned. The OP said any leftover HOA funds are handed over to a privately owned golf club, which residents still have to pay to join.\n\nThey also described a tough situation with one of their neighbors, an elderly woman and her 90-year-old mother. The longtime residents were being forced to sell their home due to unpaid HOA dues.\n\nWhile legal responsibility may lie with the homeowners, the story left some commenters frustrated\n\n\"Just horrible what they do…they go as far as to foreclose on these poor people!\" one said.\n\nDo you think the government should ban gas-powered lawn tools?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nBeyond financial and governance disputes, critics say this reflects a broader national issue with HOAs stalling progress, including environmentally beneficial upgrades.\n\nAcross the U.S., HOAs have faced backlash for blocking rooftop solar panels, banning native plant lawns, or even fining homeowners for making sustainable changes to their homes.\n\nThese restrictions can prevent residents from reducing their carbon footprints, which is detrimental to their local environment.\n\nWhile it can feel like an uphill battle, homeowners do have the power to organize, update HOA bylaws, and push for fairer rules.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "The \"Huberman Lab\" podcast host says good health comes down to \"intentionally high cortisol in the morning and intentionally low cortisol at night.\"",
    "fullText": "Andrew Huberman says one simple morning habit helps him optimize his physical and mental health.\n\nThe neuroscientist and podcaster said people should aim for high cortisol in the morning and low cortisol at night.\n\nThe \"best way\" to spike morning cortisol levels is to get daylight soon after waking up, he said.\n\nStanford neuroscientist Andrew Huberman says one morning habit plays a key role in his overall health.\n\nIn an interview with GQ published on Monday, the host of the popular \"Huberman Lab\" podcast shared the routines he's relying on to stay healthy in 2026.\n\n\"Getting your physical health right — which puts your mental health in the best possible place — is all about intentionally high cortisol in the morning and intentionally low cortisol at night,\" Huberman told GQ.\n\nAlthough cortisol has a bad reputation as a stress hormone, Huberman says it plays an important role in how the body transitions from sleep to wakefulness.\n\n\"No, you wake up in the morning because of a rise in cortisol. You want a big, massive spike of cortisol in the morning. If you don't spike your morning cortisol, your cortisol spikes in the afternoon or evening, and then everything goes awry, OK? You want your morning cortisol at least 30x higher than your nighttime cortisol,\" he said.\n\nOne way to keep that rhythm on track would be to send the body a signal.\n\n\"The best way to spike your morning cortisol is to get bright light — ideally from sunlight — in your eyes in the first hour after waking. If you can't do that, maybe invest in a 10,000 Lux artificial light,\" Huberman said.\n\nIf that's not possible, he suggests flipping on \"as many artificial lights as you can.\"\n\n\"I've made a mistake in the past — a tactical mistake, a strategic mistake — by calling it sunlight. People say, 'It's overcast.' What we should say is, 'Get daylight in your eyes,'\" he said.\n\nHaving dim mornings and bright nights is \"the worst way to go,\" he added.\n\nLight exposure isn't the only thing Huberman says matters in the morning. He also encourages people to fit in a workout if they can.\n\n\"If you don't have time to exercise first thing in the morning, you need bodily movement. Even some knee bends, some arm swings, some jumping jacks. Movement generates cortisol and adrenaline,\" he said.\n\nWhen it comes to winding down at night, people should take the opposite approach, Huberman said.\n\n\"If you want to wear BluBlockers, you can. But dim the lights down, avoid caffeine. If you're going to exercise, don't make it terribly intense,\" he said.\n\nThe benefits of getting light in the mornings are supported by broader research in the field.\n\nMariana Figueiro, professor and director of the Light and Health Research Center at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, told Business Insider in 2023 that getting daylight is \"just as important as diet and exercise.\"\n\n\"Light in the built environment is not always strong enough to synchronize the biological clock,\" Figueiro said. \"The beauty of daylight is that daylight is the right amount, it's the right color, it's on at the right time.\"\n\nMoreover, getting enough darkness at night is just as crucial, since circadian disruption has been linked to poor cognitive performance and a weakened immune system, Figueiro said.",

There's no point in messing up business further.\"\"So at the moment I don't expect much reaction out of Japan, per se, particularly on industry.

So at the moment that doesn't look like it's going happen, but if it gets more severe, you will start to see the Japanese and potentially other countries react negatively against Chinese interests.\"Johnson said the measure could slow Japanese industrial activity by restricting access to critical materials, forcing them to seek alternative suppliers.Japan's foreign ministry said on Wednesday it strongly protested the measures and demanded that China withdraw them. It called the move \"absolutely unacceptable and deeply regrettable\" and said the measures targeted only Japan and that they \"deviate significantly from international practice.\"Johnson said Japan is unlikely to respond immediately but could retaliate if restrictions intensify, adding that other countries could potentially follow suit.",

    "description": "Natalie Gialenes sued the city of Austin and ex-officer Joseph Spees, alleging a brutal takedown and traumatic brain injury during a 2024 arrest. Spees was fired over the incident last month.",
    "fullText": "The woman a former Austin police officer slammed to the ground during a 2024 arrest has filed a federal lawsuit against the officer and the City of Austin, alleging the incident amounted to “indefensible police brutality” and left her with a traumatic brain injury.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Monday, comes weeks after Austin Police Chief Lisa Davis indefinitely suspended — effectively firing — Officer Joseph Spees over his conduct during the arrest of Natalie Gialenes, who was visiting Austin from out of state.\n\nIn her complaint, Gialenes alleges she was standing outside her hotel on East Cesar Chavez Street during the early morning hours of Dec. 7, 2024, when Spees arrested her for public intoxication, a Class C misdemeanor punishable by a fine. According to the suit, Gialenes voluntarily placed her hands behind her back and did not resist being handcuffed.\n\nAs Spees escorted her toward his patrol car, Gialenes dropped her identification card on the ground and bent down to retrieve it, the lawsuit states. At that point, Spees abruptly used force, slamming her to the pavement.\n\n\"Rather than tell Ms. Gialenes to stop or stand up straight, allow her to pick up her identification off the ground, or use any de-escalation tactics of any kind whatsoever, Officer Spees grabbed the young woman by her upper arm without warning, lifted up on her arm to raise her up slung her around his body in almost a complete circle, and threw her to the ground,\" the complaint alleges.\n\nBecause her hands were cuffed behind her back, Gialenes was unable to break her fall and struck her head on the pavement, according to the lawsuit. She bled heavily and was later hospitalized with a traumatic brain injury, along with injuries to her face, chest and feet. The suit further alleges that Spees later shoved her head-first into the back seat of his patrol car, causing her to strike her head a second time, even as blood pooled on the ground in the hotel driveway.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning the city had not been served with the lawsuit, according to spokesperson Erik Johnson, who said in a prepared statement that officials would \"review it and respond appropriately.\" Austin Police Association President Michael Bullock, who often weighs in on personnel matters, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe incident was first made public last month when Davis released a 14-page disciplinary memo explaining her decision to indefinitely suspend Spees, who had worked for the department for 11 years. In the memo, Davis wrote that “any objectively reasonable officer — and especially an experienced and well-trained officer like Officer Spees — should have been able to handle minimal resistance without immediately resorting to a violent takedown that caused considerable injury.”\n\nAccording to the disciplinary memo, Spees told internal affairs investigators that one of Gialenes' hands slipped out of the handcuffs the officer placed her in, which represented a severe threat.\n\nBut Davis described the claims as dubious. \"I do not believe that any objectively reasonable officer could share Officer Spees' judgment that [Gialenes] posed a level 8 out of 10 threat while she was handcuffed and he was escorting her to his patrol car,\" the chief wrote in her memo.\n\nGialenes is represented by Austin civil rights attorney Jeff Edwards, who said in a news release that the incident reflects a broader pattern of excessive force within the department. As a result of Spees’ actions, Edwards said, Gialenes “suffered a painful and serious brain injury that will impact her for the rest of her life.”\n\n\"APD must do more than terminate the officer – it must acknowledge the department’s systematic wrongdoing, revamp its disciplinary system, and change its training immediately, or more people will continue to be senselessly injured by APD officers,\" Edwards said.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to include comment from the city of Austin",

    "description": "You can find UPS trucks all over the place, from your driveway to the nearest interstate, but who actually makes those brown, boxy vehicles?",
    "fullText": "UPS trucks are made by several different manufacturers. This is because UPS, which was hacked a while back, uses many different types of vehicles for its sizeable fleet. From the step-in vans you see making local, last-mile deliveries to semi-trucks pulling multiple trailers across the interstates, UPS has used a variety of truckmakers that change over time and by the market served to provide vehicles that are right for their purpose.\n\nAs of 2024, UPS, which was the first carrier to be certified for drone delivery, has a worldwide fleet of 135,000 vehicles. Of these, 100,000 are based in the U.S. Fun fact — UPS replaces around 7,000 of its step-in vans in the U.S. each year. Its fleet also includes over 19,000 vehicles that use advanced technologies or alternative fuels, of which 13,000 are step-in vans that use renewable natural gas. Worldwide, UPS services over 200 countries and territories with its Global Small Package Operations. The company delivered 5.7 billion packages in 2024, which averaged out to 22.4 million each day, with total revenue of $91.1 billion.\n\nStarting with step-in vans, also known in UPS lingo as \"package cars,\" some are made by Morgan Olson. Other UPS package cars are made by Utilimaster. When it comes to tractor-trailers for UPS' long-haul trucking operations, a primary resource is Kenworth, who has been supplying UPS with natural gas-powered tractors for more than 16 years. Another source of UPS' heavy trucks is Freightliner, who delivered UPS' first all-electric semi truck, an eCascadia, that was put into service in February 2023.\n\nMorgan Olson, a division of J.B. Poindexter & Co., has production facilities in Ringgold, Virginia, Loudon, Tennessee, and Sturgis, Michigan. Morgan Olson claims on its website that its vans \"provide the most durable, long-life delivery solution for the package delivery industry.\" Morgan Olson offers parcel delivery step vans that can range up to 24 feet in length, 93 inches in width, and 85 inches in height, with a maximum Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of 30,000 pounds.\n\nUtilimaster facilities are currently located in Kansas City, Missouri, Landisville, Pennsylvania, Bristol, Indiana, and Saltillo, Mexico, with a capacity of over 5,000 vehicles each day. Utilimaster purchased the assets of Union City Body Company, which had previously supplied package cars to UPS, in November of 2005. Utilimaster, which is now part of the Aebi Schmidt Group, continues to make walk-in vans that are used by UPS and other package delivery services.\n\nKenworth, which is owned by PACCAR, is headquartered in Kirkland, Washington. Its manufacturing is done at factories located in Renton, Washington, Chillicothe, Ohio, and Ste-Therese, Quebec, Canada. Its corporate focus is, according to the company's website, to find \"ways to use the latest technology to build efficient trucks that provide transportation solutions to our customers.\"\n\nFreightliner, which celebrates its 84th anniversary in 2026, has its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. Freightliner's production is based in several North American locations that include Fort Mill, South Carolina, Gaffney, South Carolina, Santiago Tianguistenco, Mexico, and Saltillo, Mexico. Freightliner is a part of Daimler Truck North America, a major worldwide producer of trucks and buses.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

That’s how confident I am.\" News broke on Tuesday, December 30, that Diggs was charged with felony strangulation or suffocation and misdemeanor assault and battery over the alleged incident with the chef, which she claimed happened at his home on December 2. The police report referenced Diggs’ \"girlfriend,\" leading some to speculate it was referring to Cardi. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MAY 12: Stefon Diggs and Cardi B celebrate after Game Four of the Eastern Conference Second Round NBA Playoffs between the Boston Celtics and the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on May 12, 2025 in New York City. Elsa/Getty Images After the chef contacted police she said she “received a voice mail and text messages from a female that she believed to be Diggs girlfriend.” “The messages stated something to the effect of ‘you don’t need to do all this. It’s not that big of a deal,’” the report said. Cardi and Diggs have been linked since late 2024. The couple welcomed their first baby, a son, in November. Us Weekly has reached out to Cardi’s lawyer for comment. Diggs’ attorney, David Meier, said his client “categorically denies” the allegations in a statement to Us on December 30. Patriots Star Stefon Diggs’ Alleged Text Messages Revealed With Woman Accusing Him of Strangulation “They are unsubstantiated, uncorroborated and were never investigated — because they did not occur,” the statement said. “The timing and motivation for making the allegations is crystal clear: They are the direct result of an employee-employer financial dispute that was not resolved to the employee’s satisfaction. Stefon looks forward to establishing the truth in a court of law.” Diggs returned to the field on Sunday, January 4, as the Patriots hosted the Miami Dolphins in their regular season finale. The franchise has pledged their support to Diggs in the aftermath of the charges. “Stefon has informed the organization that he categorically denies the allegations. We support Stefon,” the team said in a statement on December 30. “We will continue to gather information and will cooperate fully with the appropriate authorities and the NFL as necessary. Out of respect for all parties involved, and given that this is an ongoing legal matter, we will have no further comment at this time.” The Patriots host the Los Angeles Chargers in the NFL Wild Card Round on Sunday, January 11.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump insisted Tuesday that Republicans have “so many good nuggets” to campaign on this year as they try to hold onto their razor-thin margin in the House.\n\nBut the president’s nearly 90-minute speech before House Republicans had little in the way of a fresh policy agenda or a cohesive new message to guide the year. Instead, he meandered from defending his actions during the Capitol riot five years ago to joking about being liberal-minded to win the votes of transgender people to making head-scratching references to Franklin Delano Roosevelt's use of a wheelchair.\n\nAs he promised political “ammunition” to help Republicans, Trump emphasized the success of his 2024 presidential campaign, reminding the audience that he carried every swing state as he pondered why voters tend to turn against the party in power during midterm elections.\n\n“They say that when you win the presidency, you lose the midterms,” Trump said in remarks at the Kennedy Center, the performing arts venue that his allies recently renamed for him. “I wish you could explain to me what the hell is going on with the mind of the public.”\n\nHe warned that if Democrats regain control of Congress, “they'll find a way to impeach me.”\n\nTrump's appearance at the GOP's policy forum was meant to ensure House Republicans and the White House were aligned on their agenda ahead of the November midterms that will determine control of Congress and the course of Trump's final two years in office. Rising health care costs, Trump’s expansive foreign policy pursuits and other issues are dramatically splitting the GOP, as some Republicans become more comfortable crossing party lines to bypass House Speaker Mike Johnson and join proposals from Democrats.\n\nIt all points to a difficult year ahead for the president and his party, especially as the House’s slim majority narrowed Tuesday with the sudden death of California Rep. Doug LaMalfa, which was announced to lawmakers as they traveled to the performing arts center, and the resignation of former Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, which took effect at midnight.\n\nBut Trump spent more time rehashing past grievances during the appearance than articulating a broad election-year strategy or offering specifics on how he's addressing affordability concerns of voters.\n\n“We won every swing state. We won the popular vote by millions. We won everything,\" Trump said, recounting the 2024 presidential election.\n\nTrump mused about unconstitutionally seeking a third term as president and claimed it was never reported that he urged his supporters to walk “peacefully and patriotically” on Jan. 6, 2021, to the Capitol, where they rioted to try to overturn his election loss. He used his wife, first lady Melania Trump, to poke at Roosevelt, the former Democratic president who used a wheelchair.\n\nAccording to the president, Melania Trump thinks the dancing he does at his rallies is not presidential.\n\n“She actually said, ‘Could you imagine FDR dancing?’ She actually said that to me,” Trump said. “And I said there’s a long history that perhaps she doesn’t know.”\n\nTrump did try to rally the conference at times, asserting that his first year back in office was so successful that Republicans should win in November on that basis alone. He briefly touched on Venezuela and the dramatic capture of deposed president Nicolás Maduro — calling it “brilliant, tactically.” He talked about money coming into the U.S. through tariffs and direct investment, and negotiations to bring down drug prices.\n\n“You have so many good nuggets. You have to use them. If you can sell them, we’re going to win,” Trump said. He claimed that “we’ve had the most successful first year of any president in history and it should be a positive.”\n\nHouse Republicans convened as they launch their new year agenda, with health care issues in particular dogging the GOP heading into the midterm elections. Trump declined to publicly counsel GOP lawmakers on how they should handle this week’s vote — pushed by Democrats and a handful of Republicans who broke from their party -- to extend insurance subsidies that expired at year’s end, or on how to deal with the next potential government shutdown just weeks away, all with a narrower majority.\n\n“You can’t be tough when you have a majority of three, and now, sadly, a little bit less than that,” Trump said after paying tribute to LaMalfa, noting the challenges House Speaker Mike Johnson faces in keeping their ranks unified.\n\nThe president also noted that Rep. Jim Baird, R-Ind., was recovering after a “bad” car accident, further slimming Johnson’s vote margins.\n\nVotes on extending expired health insurance subsidies are expected as soon as this week, and it’s unclear whether the president and the party will try to block passage. Trump urged Republicans to own the issue of health care, a policy that Republicans have long struggled on, and said the party should be “flexible” on abortion restrictions that have been well-established federal policy.\n\n“You have to be a little flexible” on the Hyde Amendment, Trump told House Republicans. “You gotta be a little flexible. You gotta work something. You gotta use ingenuity.” The Hyde Amendment is a decades-old policy that bars federal money from being spent on abortion services.\n\nGOP lawmakers were hosting a daylong policy forum at the Kennedy Center, where the board, stocked by Trump with loyalists, recently voted to rename it the Trump Kennedy Center. The move is being challenged in court. Trump and Johnson are trying to corral Republican lawmakers at a time when rank-and-file lawmakers have felt increasingly emboldened enough to buck Trump and the leadership’s wishes on issues such as the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\nAP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro and Associated Press writer Will Weissert contributed to this report.\n\nAn earlier version of this story mistakenly reported that Rep. Jim Baird represents Wisconsin. Baird represents Indiana in the U.S. House.",

    "description": "Hiring skills over people is no longer en vogue as firms deprioritize DEI and cut down on recruiting costs.",
    "fullText": "Higher education is undergoing an identity crisis. Repeated attacks from the Trump administration, the rise of AI and budget shortfalls have put top universities on the defensive as public sentiment on the value of a college degree sours. But a new trend in company hiring suggests that elite colleges aren’t losing their edge anytime soon.\n\nA 2025 survey of over 150 companies found that more than a quarter, 26%, were recruiting from a brief selection of schools, up from 17% that were doing the same in 2022, according to recruiting intelligence firm Veris Insights, which conducted the research.\n\nEven most of the surveyed companies that weren’t recruiting from a shortlist of universities said they were focusing on “target schools,” while also accepting applications from a list of other schools. That means candidates from prestigious universities that are located close to a company’s headquarters are typically given priority, according to Chelsea Schein, Veris’s vice president of research strategy, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\n“Employers are increasingly turning to degree and GPA in a hiring decision,” Schein told Fortune. “There’s an increasing recognition among employers that they can be more targeted in their approach.”\n\n“Talent is everywhere” hiring seems to have fallen out of style for many reasons, according to entry-level recruiters. For one, it’s expensive. It takes high sums to set up meetings with candidates and get recruiters to campuses across the country. Further, AI-generated résumés have made many applications appear identical, causing some recruiters to fall back on university prestige to distinguish candidates. And for many companies, DEI is no longer a priority.\n\nThis hiring trend harkens back to pre-pandemic days and the tight labor market of 2018 and 2019, when firms prioritized in-person interaction, according to researchers specializing in entry-level recruitment. Today, most firms recruit from about 30 colleges out of 4,000 universities, looking first at elite colleges and then schools nearby a company’s corporate offices as companies seek to recruit candidates for in-person work.\n\nThis trend is evident among top firms. Once accustomed to multiple passes through 45 to 50 schools per year, GE Appliances has resigned to four or five events per semester at just 15 institutions.\n\nFinancial technology firm Bill says it is focused on recruiting from colleges near its corporate offices in San Jose, Calif., and Draper, Utah.\n\nMcKinsey, the prominent New York-based consulting firm, is “recommitting to a high-touch process,” hosting in-person events with alumni who work at the company at a shortlist of 20 universities, according to Blair Ciesil, a McKinsey recruiting partner. The announcement comes after the firm axed language on its career page that said, “We hire people, not degrees.”\n\nThis trend may lend a much-needed competitive edge to elite institutions as sentiment toward higher education sours. In 2025, just 35% of surveyed adults in the U.S. said that a college education was “very important.” That’s down from 70% in 2013. And just one-third of American voters said that a four-year degree was worth the cost over the same time period, according to NBC.\n\nYet enrollment in higher education is actually up. Despite skepticism of a four-year degree’s value proposition, institutions awarded nearly 2.2 million bachelor’s degrees in 2025, up from 1.6 million in 2010.\n\nSome recruiters say college isn’t worth it, like recruitment agency Randstad CEO Sander van ’t Noordende, telling Fortune he believes people must “reflect on—taking a student loan, going to college and being trained or educated for a profession that is rapidly changing—whether that’s still the right path.” This comes as nearly half of Millennials and Gen Z say college was a waste of money, with Gen Z men feeling the impact most: their unemployment rate now matches that of Gen Z men without degrees.\n\nFor some, the payoff may still be worth it. College degree holders still earn more on average than those with just a high school degree. The college wage premium, or the earning’s gap between workers with a bachelor’s degree or higher and non-college-educated workers, sits at roughly 90%, according to the Federal Reserve of Cleveland. However, that number has plateaued over the past decade after rising steadily from the 1980s through the mid-2010s.\n\n“I’d rather be a student with a degree than without a degree,” Schein said.\n\nBut even for students who enroll in the nearly 4,000 accredited institutions across the country, a bachelor’s degree may not be enough to grab the attention of some of the country’s top recruiters — unless it comes from an elite institution.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "In this week’s newsletter: Stranger Things’ climactic showdown is the latest pop culture spectacle to feel like its been ported straight from a console. The industries’ reciprocally influential relationship can be to everyone’s gain\n\nDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? \nIt had begun to feel like an endurance test by the end, but nonetheless, like the sucker I am, I watched the Stranger Things finale last week. And spoiler warning: I’m going to talk about it in general terms in this newsletter. Because approximately 80% of the final season comprised twentysomething “teenagers” explaining things to each other while using random 1980s objects to illustrate convoluted plans and plot points, my expectations were not high. After an interminable hour, finally, something fun happens, as the not-kids arm themselves with machine guns and molotovs and face off against a monstrously gigantic demon-crab. Aha, I thought – the final boss battle!\n\nThe fight was like something out of Monster Hunter, all scale and spectacle with a touch of desperation. For a very long time, video games sought to imitate cinema. Now cinema (and TV) often feels like a video game. The structure of Stranger Things’ final season reminded me a lot of Resident Evil: long periods of walking slowly through corridors, with characters exchanging plot information aloud on their way to the action, and occasional explosions of gunfire, screeching monsters or car chases. Those long periods of relative inaction are much more tolerable when you’ve got a controller in your hands. I am all for TV and film embracing the excitement, spectacle and dynamism of video games, but do they have to embrace the unnecessary side-quests and open-world bloat, too?\n\nThe reciprocally influential relationship between games, TV and film has developed a lot in the last few years. A generation of gen X and elder-millennial gamers have recently aged into creative and commissioning power in these industries. That’s why we’re getting people such as Jonathan Nolan heading up an excellent Fallout TV show, and indeed why all video-game-to-screen adaptations have become dramatically less terrible in the past five years or so. It also inevitably means that the boundaries between interactive and non-interactive entertainment are becoming more porous: where previously game-makers were heavily influenced by film (primarily but not exclusively Alien/s and Star Wars), now that relationship works both ways. Most Marvel movies look and feel like a video game to me, and not just because they’re all full of computer-generated graphics. It’s the mood and pace of them.\n\nEdge of Tomorrow remains the most video-game-ish movie I’ve ever seen: its premise revolves around dying and respawning, trying out different things on each run. It’s a sci-fi roguelike of a film. I wanted to play Mad Max: Fury Road the entire time I was watching it, and John Wick 4 was literally a fighting-game boss rush. When film critics say that a film feels like a video game, they often mean it disparagingly; a lot of cinephiles still see games as the lower form. When I say a movie feels like a video game, it’s a compliment – unless it feels like a boring video game.\n\nThis was the problem, for me, with Stranger Things: every episode felt like loading up an open-world game that I hadn’t played for a few months. More and more characters kept appearing, and I didn’t remember or care who most of them were. Between the Upside Down, Vecna’s mindscape, real-world Hawkins and an entirely new dimension introduced in the last couple of episodes, there were too many locations to keep track of. Every episode brought on the mild despair I feel when I think I’m near the end of an overlong game, only to discover yet another entirely new area to explore. The painfully long epilogue, meanwhile, was rivalled only by Red Dead Redemption 2’s interminable post-game hours. Please, just let it end already!\n\nOf course, in modern pop culture, nothing is ever allowed to end properly, not if it’s still making money. I’m surprised there’s been no word of an official Stranger Things video game tie-in (outside of a retro-style smartphone beat-em-up from 2019). Come to think of it, we don’t see many of these kinds of licensed games any more: back in the 00s and 2010s, most major movies and TV shows launched with an interactive accompaniment. Presumably this is because of the spiralling cost of game development – you can’t knock out a mediocre PlayStation 2 game in nine months any more – but also, when TV shows feel so much like games, do we really need an adaptation anyway?\n\nThe first game I’ve finished in 2026 is Indika, a surreal and mildly horrible game about a young nun questioning her faith and having conversations with the devil as she goes on an extremely strange journey through bleak, snow-covered villages and abandoned factories with an escaped convict. There are much-needed flashes of humour in here, but also stuff about religion, control and sexuality that I haven’t seen in a video game before. It’s also part of a small wave of games (see Baby Steps) that mocks gamer mentality: there are points, but they are pointless; explore off the beaten path and you will find something useless and inconsequential rather than a secret or something fun. And that’s if you find anything at all.\n\nAvailable on: PC, PS5, Xbox, Nintendo Switch\n\n Estimated playtime: five hours\n\nDavid Rosen, the co-founder of Sega and an influential figure in the history of arcade video games, died on Christmas Day at 95. Keith Stuart writes about his very interesting life.\n\nHollow Knight: Silksong has picked up a game-of-the-year trophy in PC games storefront Steam’s publicly voted awards. The Sit Back and Relax award was won by something I’ve never heard of: RV There Yet. I have bought it out of curiosity.\n\nMy book about Nintendo is out next month! It’s called Super Nintendo and it’s a lively cultural history of the most beloved company in games, based on 20 years of interviews (and 30 years as a player). You can support the Guardian by ordering it through the Guardian Bookshop, and I’ll also be doing launch events around the UK throughout February.\n\nThe 15 best PS5 games to play in 2026\n\n‘I wanted that Raiders of the Lost Ark excitement – you could die any minute’\n\nFrom K-pop and The Traitors to Grand Theft Auto VI: your A-Z of the biggest culture of 2026\n\nIn a recent Pushing Buttons, Keza mentioned that games have consolidated into five established mega-franchises and I was trying to work out which franchises these are? I guessed GTA, Fortnite, Call of Duty, Minecraft and EA FC, but don’t have huge confidence in that!\n\nYou’re not far off. According to data from Circana, the top five most played games on PlayStation 5 this year were exactly the same as last year: Fortnite, Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto 5 (including Online), Roblox and Minecraft. All of these games are five to 10-plus years old. This stagnation at the top is why every big publisher has spent millions in the last decade trying to create live-service games, and why most of them have flopped. Last year on Steam, meanwhile, only 14% of all playtime was spent on new games released in 2025. Any developer releasing something new, be they blockbuster or indie, is competing for a sliver of a sliver of players’ time and money. These stats explain a lot about why the games industry is where it is right now, and why there’s such a bleak mood among many developers.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Move follows outcry over use of Grok to digitally remove clothing from images of women and children\n\nUK politics live – latest updates\n\nThe influential Commons women and equalities committee has decided to stop using X after the social media site’s AI tool began generating thousands of digitally altered images of women and children with their clothes removed.\n\nThe move by the cross-party committee places renewed pressure on ministers to take decisive action after the site was flooded with images including sexualised and unclothed pictures of children, generated by its AI tool, Grok.\n\nSarah Owen, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said that given preventing violence against women and girls was among its key policy areas, “it has become increasingly clear that X is not an appropriate platform to be using for our communications”.\n\nLiz Kendall, the technology secretary, has called the imagery “appalling and unacceptable in decent society” and urged Ofcom, the UK’s media regulator, to take whatever action is needed.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday, Keir Starmer’s spokesperson said that “all options remain on the table” for Ofcom, which has the power to impose huge fines or to restrict access to a site.\n\nThe decision by the women and equalities committee is the first significant move by a Westminster organisation to exit X. It is understood the committee took the decision at a meeting on Wednesday. It will keep its X account, which has about 27,000 followers, in existence, but dormant, to ensure no one else can take it over.\n\nWhile the decision concerned only the committee’s account, some individual members, including Owen, have already stopped using X. Another, the Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine, said she was leaving the platform, calling the images generated by Grok “the last straw”.\n\nJardine said she had taken the view that X was a good way to communicate with constituents. “But I cannot in all conscience continue to use a platform which seems unwilling to act against this grossly offensive and abusive online behaviour towards women and girls.”\n\nOwen also plans to write to the Cabinet Office and to Ofcom to urge action against X. She said: “I personally came off X in 2024 after the platform and its owner promoted and paid creators of far-right racist and misogynistic material. The committee heard at the end of last year on inquiries about community cohesion that X posts regularly break UK law on hate speech.\n\n“In recent days, X and xAI have allowed the creation and sharing of AI deepfakes, non-consensual intimate imagery, and child sexual abuse material, all areas identified as online violence against women and girls by our committee.\n\n“We do not view it as appropriate to use such a platform to share our work. I hope that the government, Ofcom and relevant law enforcement agencies work quickly to make X immediately abide by UK law on online safety and non-consensual intimate image abuse, to be held to account for its failures and if it refuses to abide by our laws, it must be appropriately sanctioned.”\n\nOn Monday, Ofcom said it was aware of serious concerns raised about Grok creating images of undressed people and sexualised images of children. It said it had contacted X and xAI “to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK” and would assess the need for an investigation based on the company’s response.\n\nStarmer’s spokesperson said: “What we have seen on Grok is a disgrace. It is completely unacceptable. No one should have to go through the ordeal of deepfakes of themselves online, and we won’t allow the proliferation of these demeaning images.\n\n“X needs to deal with this urgently, and Ofcom has our full backing to take enforcement action wherever firms are failing to protect UK users. It already has the power to issue fines of up to billions of pounds and even stop access to a site that is violating the law. And when it comes to keeping people safe online, all options remain on the table.”\n\nAsked about the issue, Kemi Badenoch’s spokesperson said the Conservative leader agreed with the government: “We both find it absolutely abhorrent and want to see it clamped down upon as soon as possible.”\n\nAsked if this could mean Badenoch, an enthusiastic user of X who has 350,000 followers, might leave the platform, the spokesperson said: “We are very clear that what is happening with those Grok deepfakes is absolutely disgusting and there has to be some something done to stop that. I’m not about to announce policy here.”\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Nigel Farage was asked if he was happy to earn money from a site that had a business model based in part on child sexual abuse material. The Reform UK leader is paid for engagement on the site as a much-followed verified user.\n\nFarage avoided the question but said he was “very worried” about the images and said he believed X would listen to the criticism.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Chinese independent refiners are expected to switch to heavy crude from sources including Iran in coming months to replace Venezuelan shipments halted since the ​U.S. removed the country's president, traders and analysts said.\n\nCaracas and Washington agreed to export up to $2 ‌billion worth of Venezuelan crude to the United States, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday, after U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro over ‌the weekend.\n\nThat arrangement is likely to curtail Venezuelan supply to China, analysts say, reducing a source of cheap oil for independent refiners known as teapots. The world's biggest crude importer is a major buyer of discounted sanctioned oil from Russia, Iran and Venezuela.\n\n\"The Venezuela drama hits China's independent refineries the hardest, as they may lose access to the ⁠discounted heavy barrels,\" said Sparta Commodities analyst ‌June Goh.\n\n\"However as there are ample Russian and Iranian feedstocks available and Venezuelan barrels on water, we do not foresee the teapots needing to bid up for unsanctioned barrels as ‍the economics would likely not make sense for them,\" she said.\n\nChina imported 389,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan oil in 2025, about 4% of its total seaborne crude imports, Kpler data showed.\n\nAt least a dozen sanctioned vessels that loaded in December departed Venezuelan ​waters in early January carrying some 12 million barrels of crude and fuel, Reuters has reported. However, loadings ‌for Asia at Venezuela's main ports have stopped since January 1, shipping data showed.\n\nWith supply tightening, sellers of Venezuelan Merey crude for prompt delivery offered cargoes at discounts of about $10 per barrel to ICE Brent versus $15 last month, said one trader, although trade has come to a standstill.\n\nAnother trader said offers were at minus $11 per barrel.\n\nFLOATING STORAGE CAN LAST 75 DAYS\n\nVenezuelan crude aboard ships in Asia remains sufficient to cover roughly 75 days of Chinese demand, limiting any ⁠immediate upside for alternatives, said Kpler senior analyst Xu Muyu.\n\nTeapots using ​Venezuelan oil are likely to switch to Russian and Iranian supply ​in March and April, and China can also tap non-sanctioned sources such as Canada, Brazil, Iraq, and Colombia, she said.\n\nBuyers have yet to start sourcing alternatives, trade sources said, with Iranian Heavy ‍crude priced at a discount ⁠of about $10 per barrel to ICE Brent in ample supply, the cheapest alternative.",

    "fullText": "Influencer Sergio Jiménez reportedly died during a private New Year’s Eve livestream. He was 37.\n\nSpanish outlets El País and El Periódico reported that Jiménez was allegedly completing challenges, including consuming alcohol and cocaine in exchange for money.\n\nJiménez was known on streaming platforms Kick and Twitch as “Sancho” or “Sssanchopanza.” People reported that he rose to online fame in October 2025 when he was featured in a series of videos by Simón Pérez, a streamer known for allegedly using drugs in front of a live audience on various platforms.\n\nEl País reported that Pérez alleged in a Sunday, January 4, YouTube livestream that Jiménez consumed six grams of cocaine on the night of his death. Pérez also claimed that he was in contact with Jiménez’s brother, who reported that he had consumed whiskey during the final livestream.\n\nAthira Auni Dead: TikTok Star Died at Age 21 After Motorcycle Accident\n\nThe outlet reported that Mossos d'Esquadra — the police force in Catalonia, Spain — launched an investigation into Jiménez’s death. Authorities have also ordered an autopsy on his body.\n\nWhile not directly addressing Jiménez’s death, Mossos d'Esquadra released a video via social media on Tuesday, January 6, encouraging people not to participate in “viral challenges” that could “put your life or your physical integrity in danger.”\n\n“The consequences of these trends can range from intoxication to physical and psychological effects, and can also have a negative impact on their reputation, affecting job and academic opportunities due to the digital footprint left behind,” an officer said in the clip, translated by People. “It's important to be aware that some trends can have consequences if they involve acts of vandalism or aggression.”\n\nJiménez died within days of TikToker Nurul Athira Auni Mohamad Hafizzan’s death at age 21 after a motorcycle accident.\n\nLooking Back at 2025 Influencer Deaths: Hailey Okula, Emilie Kiser’s Son and More Stars We Lost\n\nAuthorities believe the influencer — who went by the name Athira Auni online — was driving in the right lane when another motorcycle crashed into her from behind after swerving to try to avoid her vehicle, local outlets Sinar Daily, Sinar Harian and New Straits Times reported.\n\nThe incident occurred around 2:30 a.m. on Saturday, January 3, and Auni was pronounced dead at the scene. The other motorcyclist suffered from injuries on his hands, elbows and thighs and received medical care at Tengku Ampuan Afzan Hospital.\n\nHer body was transported to Tengku Ampuan Afzan Hospital for a post-mortem examination, according to local outlets. The case is under investigation for potential reckless or dangerous driving leading to death.\n\nAuni, who had more than 77,000 followers on a since-deleted TikTok account, was known for her livestreams and posting videos of her flipping Indian flatbread roti canai at her dad’s food stall. After the content creator’s death, her friend shared a black-and-white video of the influencer working at her father’s food stall.\n\n“On Friday, you asked me to record a video of you spreading roti canai for the last time, as if you already knew that night you were going to go make it,” a translated caption read, shared by the user @nauraa_517 via TikTok on Saturday.",

Right there. Pulitzer Prize! He got one for the bullet,” Trump said, drawing applause from the crowd.\n\n“These are the ones that take the pictures. Make me look thin for a change, Doug,” he quipped. “You’re making me look a little bit heavy. I’m not happy about it.”\n\nBut Democrats think there’s little photographers can do to help the president.\n\nNot the photographers' fault https://t.co/EI8nukJYJK pic.twitter.com/oggK2CqUXd\n\n— Democrats (@TheDemocrats) January 6, 2026\n\n“Not the photographers’ fault,” they wrote in an X post, attaching candid images of Trump taken from less-than-flattering angles.\n\nTrump, a high-flying socialite and TV personality before he entered the White House, has long been conscious of his public image.\n\nIn October, he threw a Truth Social meltdown after TIME magazine put him on the cover using a photo taken from a low angle, which highlighted the drooping skin on his neck. It didn’t help that his hair practically disappeared into the sky above him.\n\n“They ‘disappeared’ my hair, and then had something floating on top of my head that looked like a floating crown, but an extremely small one,” Trump wrote. “Really weird! I never liked taking pictures from underneath angles, but this is a super bad picture, and deserves to be called out. What are they doing, and why?”\n\nThe aging president is 6’ 3” and weighs 224 pounds, according to the results of his annual physical exam released last April. His BMI puts him in the overweight category, though the president’s physician Sean Barbabella has repeatedly cleared Trump as being in “excellent health.”\n\nTrump’s fast-food-heavy diet and love for Diet Coke are unlikely to see him shed pounds soon. Florida state senator Joe Gruters once said he saw Trump eat McDonald’s fries, a Filet-O-Fish, a Quarter Pounder, and a Big Mac all in one sitting.\n\nAs for exercise, Trump doesn’t care for much physical activity outside of the golf course.\n\n“I just don’t like it. It’s boring,” Trump told The Wall Street Journal about his opinion of exercise. “To walk on a treadmill or run on a treadmill for hours and hours like some people do, that’s not for me.”\n\nThe White House did not immediately return a request for comment about the Democratic Party’s post.",

    "fullText": "It’s that time of year again when coyote sightings increase and officials offer tips on how to keep them away from homes.\n\nThe reason you’re more likely to see coyotes in many parts of Southern California later this month isn’t surprising: coyote breeding season typically runs from late January through March. Knowing this can help residents and pet owners prepare in advance.\n\n“During this time, adult coyotes travel long distances in search of mates and food sources, resulting in more sightings,” the Huntington Beach Police Department posted Tuesday.\n\nA coyote attack on a toddler near Huntington Beach Pier made headlines in April 2022, not long after the typical mating season. A family was out by the pier around 9:45 p.m. when the 2-year-old girl was attacked.\n\nThe coyote bit the girl and knocked her down, leaving her with injuries described as non-life-threatening. Huntington Beach police officers were called to the scene, where they found two coyotes nearby and shot them both.\n\nThat same year, the city issued its Coyote Management Plan to help the community safely coexist with urban coyotes.\n\nCoyotes, which are native to California, eat a broad range of small animals, including mice, rats and gophers. “Rodents make up a majority of their diet. In the process, they control the population sizes of these animals, many of which are considered pests to humans,” the city’s plan states.\n\nUnfortunately, urban coyotes are also known to go after small pets or even children and can be attracted into neighborhoods by pet food, unsecured compost or trash, and fallen fruit.\n\nCut back vegetation that may create hiding places and shelters.\n\nQuickly harvest ripe or fallen fruit and vegetables.\n\nPick up trash and keep lids closed.\n\nKeep garbage inside a garage or secure building until pickup day.\n\nPet owners are urged not to leave small dogs outside unattended, as they may be seen as potential prey.\n\n“It is important to either keep dogs on a six-foot-long or shorter leash when outdoors or to stay within six feet of them when on your property. Coyotes may view a dog on a leash longer than six feet as an unattended pet,” officials said.\n\nProtect cats and small dogs from coyotes:\n\nWhen outside, accompany them or keep them on a leash or harness.\n\n“People who feed feral cats are often concerned that coyotes might prey on the cats,” officials said. “These concerns are well-founded, as coyotes can be attracted to outdoor pet food.”\n\nMore information, including a checklist to make your home uninviting to coyotes, is available on the Coyote Management Plan.",

Kanai said a measure exclusively targeting Japan that deviates from international practice is unacceptable and demanded it be retracted.\n\nRelations between Japan and China worsened late last year after Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said its military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan.\n\nIn December, Japan said Chinese military aircraft locked radar on its fighter jets even though there was a safe distance between them. Tokyo is barreling forward with efforts to significantly boost its military capabilities to stand up to China’s growing threats by doubling annual arms spending.\n\nLast week, China launched large-scale military drills around Taiwan for two days to warn against what it calls separatist and external forces.\n\nAt that time, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi slammed both Japan and Taiwan’s “pro-independence forces.” Wang said Japan's current leaders openly challenge China’s territorial sovereignty and the postwar international order. Japan was defeated in World War II by the United States and its allies.\n\nIn his meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung in Beijing on Monday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping mentioned China’s and South Korea’s historical rivalry against Japan, calling on the two countries to “join hands to defend the fruits of victory in World War II and safeguard peace and stability in northeast Asia.”",

    "fullText": "Sean Sweeney began experiencing symptoms including muscular pain in is neck in early 2022, putting the pain down exercise\n\nMonths later he discovered that his symptoms were actually a sign of a terminal diagnosis\n\nSweeney married his partner of 12 years, Lucy, before undergoing a nine-hour operation for his diagnosis\n\nA 31-year-old man from England who believed he'd injured himself weight training was shocked to learn his symptoms were actually a sign of brain cancer.\n\nSean Sweeney, from South Yorkshire, was diagnosed with a high-grade brain tumor in July 2022, the U.K. charity Brain Tumour Research shared in a post on Facebook.\n\nSweeney told the charity he initially thought he’d injured himself weight training after he began experiencing frequent headaches, muscular pain in his neck and tingling down his right side months earlier.\n\nAt the time, he book several physiotherapist appointments, but he was later discharged after “they couldn’t identify the cause of the pain.\"\n\n“That was worrying. I remember feeling frustrated and unsettled, thinking, 'I don't feel right,' but not being able to explain why,” said Sweeney. “I was struggling to concentrate and the symptoms just kept lingering.\"\n\nThen, that July, Sweeney suffered a sudden seizure in the early hours and was woken by his partner of 12 years, Lucy. He was taken to Doncaster Royal Infirmary, where a junior doctor told him they'd found a lesion on his brain following a CT scan.\n\n\"I felt completely numb. I didn’t cry or panic — my mind went straight to Lucy and my family,\" he said.\n\nSurgeons initially believed Sweeney's tumor might be low-grade and he tied the knot with Lucy before his surgery, but after a undergoing a nine-hour craniotomy in November 2022, he was told he had grade 3 astrocytoma, a more aggressive form of brain cancer, per Brain Tumour Research.\n\nHe was also told he only had 10 years to live, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nDuring the surgery, Sweeney also suffered an acute stroke, per the charity.\n\n\"Because I was awake, I actually remember the moment things changed. I could hear the psychologist telling the surgeon that my speech was becoming slurred,\" he said. The following day, physiotherapists noticed problems with my walking, and one side of my face had dropped.\"\n\nSweeney said though the experience was \"frightening,\" through rehabilitation he has recovered and \"today, you wouldn’t know I'd had a stroke at all.\"\n\nThe 31-year-old began five weeks of radiotherapy in January 2023, followed by 12 rounds of chemotherapy, which he finished in February 2024.\n\n\"Telling my mum, Kathleen, was incredibly difficult,\" Sweeney said of his diagnosis. \"She was shocked and initially believed my surgery meant I was cured, and it took time and many hard conversations for her to understand that there is no cure for my tumour.\"\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nSweeney is now focused on rebuilding his life.\n\n“Two years on, he’s back at work, cycling and fundraising for Brain Tumour Research alongside his family, sharing his story to give others hope and support our vital research into aggressive brain tumours,” said Brain Tumour Research.\n\nSweeney added, \"If there’s one message I’d share with anyone facing a similar diagnosis, it’s this: stay positive and try not to dwell on what’s out of your control. It’s not easy, but I truly believe a positive mindset can help you keep moving forward.\"",

    "fullText": "Editor’s Note: A lawsuit only portrays one side of a story.\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (ABC4) — In 2025, a lawsuit was filed against The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, alleging that its negligence led to serious bodily injury to a minor. This week, the Church filed a response to the lawsuit, denying the allegations.\n\nIn November 2025, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of two minors, who have not been identified due to their age, after one of the minors had sustained serious injuries during a church activity in 2022. At the time of the incident, the minors were 12 and 14 years old.\n\nA court-appointed conservator was assigned as the plaintiff on behalf of the two minor children. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was named as the defendant.\n\nThe juveniles were participating in an activity on a boat owned by their ward’s Young Women leader, according to the lawsuit. While on the boat, the 12-year-old was feeding out a rope to an inner tube when the young women’s leader reportedly accelerated.\n\nDue to the acceleration, the rope wrapped around the boy’s left foot and severed it below the ankle.\n\nThe Young Women’s leader reportedly turned the boat off but was unable to restart it because the engine flooded. The 12-year-old’s brother, who was 14 at the time and is the other minor involved in the lawsuit, called 911.\n\nThe brother had to apply a tourniquet to the injured leg and, with the help of others, attempted to paddle his brother to shore on the inner tube.\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE: Negligence lawsuit filed against Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints after child loses foot\n\nDespite additional medical attention, the 12-year-old’s foot could not be saved after undergoing two amputations. He also had to go through multiple surgeries.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the minor has sustained significant mental, emotional, and psychological trauma in addition to irreparable and life-altering harm. It also alleges that his brother sustained emotional and psychological injuries due to witnessing the incident and its impact on his brother.\n\nBecause it was a Church activity supervised by Church leaders, the plaintiffs argue that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had a responsibility and duty to the minors and breached that duty by failing to provide a safe environment and failing to properly train supervisory individuals.\n\nThe plaintiffs are asking for compensation to help both minors with medical treatment and emotional recovery, as well as for any loss of future and past enjoyment of life.\n\nOn Monday, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints filed a response to the initial lawsuit. While it admitted that some of its youth activities involve water sports and that the driver of the boat is in charge of some youth activities, it denied that it breached any of its obligations or legal responsibilities.\n\nThe Church also admitted that the adults who organized the activity were leaders within the church. However, they denied that the Young Women’s leader had increased the dangers of boating or that any injuries sustained were the result of acts, errors, or omissions by the Church.\n\nBased on Wyoming law’s due care requirements, the Church admitted it owed a duty of care to the minors but denied allegations that it breached that duty.\n\nHow to make ABC4 your preferred news source on Google\n\nIn its response, the Church argued that it bears no responsibility and that there are inherent risks of activities like watersports that it cannot prevent. It also argued that the plaintiff’s claims were barred by the volunteer immunity doctrine, which provides certain protections to individuals acting as volunteers.\n\nThe response reads, in part, “the injuries are the result of a rare and unforeseen accident that happened in the absence of negligence or lack of due care by the Defendant.”\n\nIt also says that the Church “prays plaintiff take nothing by way of the complaint” and asks the court to grant the defendant any relief that the court deems equitable.\n\nABC4 has reached out to the Church for a statement on the lawsuit and has not yet heard back.\n\nBig air, moguls, slopestyle: What to know about freestyle skiing at Winter Olympics\n\nShort track speedskating at the Winter Olympics: Here’s what to know\n\nUS star Pulisic having career year at AC Milan ahead of 2026 World Cup\n\nTunisia changes coach before World Cup after disappointing Africa Cup\n\nWorld Cup qualification shines as new objective for Congo after Africa Cup",

    "description": "Iran's army chief threatened preemptive military action Wednesday over the “rhetoric” targeting the Islamic Republic, likely referring to U.S. President Donald Trump's warning that if Tehran “violently kills peaceful protesters,” the United States “will come to their rescue.\"  The comments by Maj. Gen.",
    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran's army chief threatened preemptive military action Wednesday over the “rhetoric” targeting the Islamic Republic, likely referring to U.S. President Donald Trump's warning that if Tehran “violently kills peaceful protesters,” the United States “will come to their rescue.\"\n\nThe comments by Maj. Gen. Amir Hatami come as Iran tries to respond to what it sees as a dual threat posed by Israel and the United States, as well as the protests sparked by its economic woes that have grown into a direct challenge to its theocracy.\n\nSeeking to halt the anger, Iran's government began Wednesday paying the equivalent of $7 a month to subsidize rising costs for dinner table essentials like rice, meat and pastas. Shopkeepers warn prices for items as basic as cooking oil likely will triple under pressure from the collapse of Iran's rial currency and the end of a preferential subsidized dollar-rial exchange rate for importers and manufacturers — likely fueling further popular anger.\n\n“More than a week of protests in Iran reflects not only worsening economic conditions, but longstanding anger at government repression and regime policies that have led to Iran’s global isolation,” the New York-based Soufan Center think tank said.\n\nHatami spoke to military academy students. He took over as commander in chief of Iran's army, known by the Farsi word \"Artesh,\" after Israel killed a number of the country's top military commanders in June's 12-day war. He is the first regular military officer in decades to hold a position long controlled by Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.\n\n“The Islamic Republic considers the intensification of such rhetoric against the Iranian nation as a threat and will not leave its continuation without a response,\" Hatami said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency.\n\nHe added, “I can say with confidence that today the readiness of Iran’s armed forces is far greater than before the war. If the enemy commits an error, it will face a more decisive response, and we will cut off the hand of any aggressor.”\n\nIranian officials, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have been responding to Trump's comments, which took on more significance after the U.S. military raid that seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a longtime ally of Tehran, over the weekend. But there's been no immediate public sign of Iran preparing for an attack in the region.\n\nIranian state television reported on the start of a new subsidy of the equivalent of $7, put into the bank accounts of heads of households across the country. More than 71 million people will receive the benefit, which is 10 million Iranian rials, it reported. The rial now trades at over 1.4 million to $1 and continues to depreciate.\n\nThe subsidy is more than double than the 4.5 million rial people previously received. But already, Iranian media report sharp rises in the cost of basic goods, including cooking oil, poultry and cheese, placing additional strain on households already burdened by international sanctions targeting the country and inflation.\n\nIran's vice president in charge of executive affairs, Mohammad Jafar Ghaempanah, told reporters on Wednesday that the country was in a “full-fledged economic war.” He called for “economic surgery” to eliminate rentier policies and corruption within the country.\n\nIran has faced rounds of nationwide protests in recent years. As sanctions tightened and Iran struggled after the June war with Israel, its rial currency sharply fell in December. Protests began soon after on Dec. 28. They reached their 11th day on Wednesday and didn't appear to be stopping.\n\nSocial media videos purported to show new cities like Bojnourd, Kerman, Rasht, Shiraz and Tabriz, as well some smaller towns, joining the demonstrations on Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency offered the latest death toll of 36 for the demonstrations. It said 30 protesters, four children and two members of Iran’s security forces have been killed. Demonstrations have reached over 310 locations in 28 of Iran’s 31 provinces. More than 2,100 people have been arrested, it said.\n\nThe group, which relies on an activist network inside of Iran for its reporting, has been accurate in past unrest.",

    "description": "Growing up in Fort Lauderdale and moving to New York City has taught me that the cities we dream of won't always meet our expectations, and that's OK.",
    "fullText": "For nearly 20 years of my life, I lived in Fort Lauderdale.\n\nThe beaches, palm trees, and Pub Subs (sub sandwiches from Publix, for those unfamiliar) that were part of other people's vacations were staples of my everyday life.\n\nMaybe that's why I started yearning for somewhere that wasn't as calm and steady as I was used to — somewhere like New York City.\n\nI visited NYC for the first time in 2016, and four visits later, I made it my goal to live there one day.\n\nEach trip welcomed me with new experiences and places to explore. Getting to walk out of my hotel with no set itinerary and discover local coffee shops or pocket parks was a feeling I genuinely believed couldn't be replicated elsewhere.\n\nUnlike my days in Florida, which sometimes felt repetitive, New York always felt fresh.\n\nSo, in July, I made the leap and moved to the Big Apple. Like other transplants in their early 20s, I wanted to feel like I was living in a place that mattered, and the city's energy was intoxicating.\n\nDay by day, since moving to New York City, I've become more aware of the realities that come with actually living in the place I dreamed of.\n\nAs a tourist, I curated my experiences, planned my trips around perfect weather, and was able to appreciate a slowed-down version of the city.\n\nBut living in the city comes with a pace that's impossible to ignore.\n\nPublic transportation is crowded, fast-paced, and something I've learned to take into account when planning my days. I've had to learn to make decisions faster, leave earlier than necessary, and accept that even the smallest disruptions can throw off my entire day.\n\nPlus, the so-called \"New York tax\" that forces me to spend at least $30 the moment I walk out the door has been a humbling dose of reality.\n\nMoments like schlepping groceries in bad weather have made me miss how South Florida provides more space to slow down, too.\n\nI used to see New York City as a fantasy, but as a resident, I'm realizing that maybe that was the version I created for the \"me\" who was just passing through.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I still see New York City's appeal — just not in the ways I used to. In the same way tourists flock to the beaches I grew up on, I now see NYC as a destination people project their biggest hopes onto.\n\nAfter months of living here, I've come to realize that the mundane aspects of everyday life are what make the city feel like home, from catching an express train just before it leaves the station to waving to my building's super.\n\nAnd now, I'm able to take these lessons home to Fort Lauderdale when I visit, which I've come to see in a whole new light.\n\nOn my first trip home, the beaches I used to visit every other month, and the constant hot weather I'd tried to avoid, carried a sense of charm I had really never appreciated growing up.\n\nExperiencing it from the perspective of someone who left made me feel grateful for all the little details I used to overlook.\n\nAfter that visit, I finally understood: A place can lose its appeal once it becomes familiar, but that doesn't mean it's no longer special. A dream city may never truly live up to the images we create of it, and that's OK.\n\nI'm learning to love New York's imperfections and am enjoying rediscovering the beauty of South Florida as well.\n\nBut moreover, I'm learning to accept that home doesn't have to be a place that constantly amazes me. It's where I choose to keep building, flaws and all — and for now, that place is New York City.",

It's common practice in the industry to turn to proxy advisory firms for data collection, advice, and voting recommendations.\n\nThe practice has come under fire from the Trump administration, which signed an executive order in December calling for increased oversight of the proxy advisor industry.\n\n\"Proxy advisors regularly use their substantial power to advance and prioritize radical politically-motivated agendas,\" the executive order said.\n\nInstitutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis, were two proxy advisory firms previously used by JPMorgan and named in the Trump administration's December executive order.\n\nA spokesperson for ISS declined to comment on the news of JP Morgan cutting ties with proxy advisory firms. However, the spokesperson said, \"We are proud of our four-decade record serving the global institutional investor community,\" and will continue to do so as it prepares for the 2026 annual meeting season. Glass Lewis did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe move away from proxy firms reinforced JPMorgan's \"unwavering commitment to vote solely in clients' best interests, using our information advantage,\" the bank said in the memo.\n\nIn place of external human advisors, the asset and wealth management unit is launching an in-house AI platform, called Proxy IQ, to support shareholder decisions, according to the memo.\n\n\"Proxy IQ extends the high bar of independent analysis that our portfolio managers, research analysts and stewardship teams have always applied to every vote, using that same in-house expertise to cover all aspects of the voting process, including data and research selection, down to the smallest detail,\" JPMorgan said in the memo.\n\nThe tool will be able to aggregate and analyze proprietary data from more than 3,000 annual company meetings, it said.\n\nJPMorgan has a technology budget of $18 billion, and CEO Jamie Dimon has previously said he's out to win the AI arms race.",

Some conducted strikes. Others waged electronic warfare and engaged in intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance. And in the middle of it all, helicopters rushed troops in and out of the capital.\n\nThe US military hit bases and strategic infrastructure, battered air defenses, and overwhelmed local security teams.\n\nPresident Donald Trump revealed that an aircraft was hit without specifying by what, but the aircraft remained operational. He said that no US troops or equipment were lost, not a single aircraft.\n\nThat's not exactly a great look for the Russian-made air defenses that Venezuela was counting on. Trump said Venezuela's defenses were ready, yet US combat power, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said, disabled and dismantled the air defenses meant to shield Caracas.\n\nAnalysts told Business Insider that although hard conclusions cannot be drawn from a single combat operation, the performance of Russian systems that night might prove encouraging to Western militaries as they assess Russia's air-defense capabilities, which have shown uneven real-world performance.\n\nImportantly, air defense isn't solely determined by the system. Other factors also play a role. Missteps on the part of the operator can matter as much as an adversary's combat prowess.\n\nMattias Eken, a missile defense expert at RAND, said it shows that \"a well-planned, multi-domain Western operation can suppress or bypass even advanced Russian systems,\" especially when elements like integration, command and control, and operator proficiency may be lacking.\n\nPrior to Operation Absolute Resolve, Venezuela's air defense network was assessed to include a range of Russian-made systems, including S-300VM batteries, Buk-M2 systems, and older S-125 Pechora-2M launchers, as well as Chinese-made radars. Several of these are among Russia's more capable export systems, though they are not the newest variants used by Russian forces.\n\nAnd a Russian lawmaker said in November that Moscow had delivered new Pantsir-S1 and Buk-M2E systems to Venezuela. It is unclear which systems were operational.\n\nDouglas Barrie, an airpower expert with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the systems Venezuela fields are \"not something you'd ignore.\" And the US didn't ignore them; it made neutralizing those potential threats a priority and brought advanced stealth capabilities into the fight, such as its F-22s and F-35s.\n\nMark Cancian, a defense expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the Russian-made air defenses in Venezuela were \"pretty formidable on paper,\" adding that it was \"quite impressive that, essentially, they did no damage to the US force.\"\n\nMuch remains unknown about the operation, including whether Venezuelan air defenses were fully online, degraded before the main assault, constrained in some way, or simply caught off guard. Questions also remain about maintenance, readiness levels, and operator training.\n\nCancian said that although the systems appear capable, Venezuela's operators \"may not have the training and experience to go with it.\" Fabian Hinz, a missile expert at IISS, said there had been longstanding questions about the maintenance and training behind Venezuela's air defenses even before the operation.\n\nSurprise, along with the strengths of the US forces involved, also likely played a part.\n\nBarrie said \"you would've thought that their state of readiness should have been as high as it's ever been,\" given mounting tensions with the US, but that does not mean that Venezuelan forces anticipated an operation of this scale.\n\nHinz noted that militaries cannot maintain peak readiness indefinitely and said surprise may have reduced Venezuela's ability to respond effectively.\n\nThe questionable performance of Russian-made systems in Venezuela during the US mission is not an isolated case.\n\nKirsten Fontenrose, defense expert at the Atlantic Council, wrote this week that \"Russian air defenses have struggled to impose decisive effects in other theaters — including Syria, where Israeli strikes have repeatedly penetrated layered systems.\"\n\nIsraeli and US airpower have also defeated Iranian surface-to-air missiles, many of which were of Russian origin.\n\nThe Venezuela mission, Fontenrose said, signals to US foes like Iran that American forces are \"increasingly confident operating against Russian-derived, layered air-defense architectures\" without needing a long campaign to dismantle them.\n\nTo that exact point, Cancian said that the Venezuela operation, like Israel's strikes on Iran, \"really makes you think that the Russian systems, at least in the hands of other countries, just are not able to stand up to the highest level of attack.\"\n\nEken said that recent conflicts — such as Ukraine, Syria, and Venezuela — have \"demonstrated that Russian-made air-defence systems, though having a formidable reputation, have shown inconsistent real-world performance.\"\n\nIn the ongoing war against Ukraine, where Russia has fielded a greater variety of systems, including more modern variants, run by experienced Russian operators at a generally higher state of combat readiness, performance has been better.\n\nHowever, it has not been as good as anticipated, even against airpower inferior to that of the US military, which fields vastly more advanced capabilities.\n\nEven Russia's S-400 — widely considered one of its best — has shown operational limitations and vulnerabilities that Ukraine has found ways to exploit, though not to neutralize entirely. Pantsir, Buk, and S-300 variants have all suffered attrition.\n\nNo air defense system scores a hit every time. That includes American systems like the MIM-104 Patriot. But while it has repaired its reputation in Ukraine, the performance of Russian systems has indicated they don't always live up to the hype.\n\nPerformance, Barrie said, has been \"kind of a mix and match\" in Ukraine, where \"some of it has worked less well than perhaps we expected it to.\"\n\nRussian-made air defenses, while capable, are not impenetrable, and experts argue that the Venezuela operation, coupled with the performance of Russian systems elsewhere, could give the US \"confidence that it could stand up to the Russians\" and get \"the upper hand in an air battle,\" as Cancian put it.\n\nHe said combat has shown that Russian-made systems \"work against some level of opposition,\" but not necessarily \"against the very highest levels of opposition.\"\n\nEken said the Venezuela operation showed that \"when Western or NATO forces combine stealth assets, electronic attacks, standoff fires, and cyber and space effects in a well-coordinated plan, they can create temporary openings in Russian-built air defences.\"\n\nHowever, both experts acknowledged that this was an operation that was carefully planned over months. That's different from a large, prolonged fight that involves a different kind of fighting, more frequent attacks. In that situation, Hinz said, Russia's air defense network \"does quite well.\"\n\nHinz said the Venezuela \"operation would have bolstered US and NATO confidence in their ability to penetrate contested airspace and dismantle Russian-supplied air defence systems.\"\n\nBut a large, high-intensity conflict, such as a battle between the NATO alliance and Russia, could demand constant suppression, destruction, and cyber operations. \"Western militaries possess a technological and doctrinal edge, but success would hinge on sustained, integrated operations rather than opportunistic raids,\" Hinz said.\n\nAt the end of the day, the mixed performance aside, Russian air defenses are still fearsome threats.\n\nBarrie said that \"if the thought is actually Russian SAM systems aren't all they're cracked up to be and actually we don't have to worry about them, I wouldn't go there at all. I think that would be horribly complacent.\"",

    "fullText": "If there's one healthy habit I've consistently followed for years, it's the Mediterranean diet. As a dietitian, I'm drawn to its flexibility, vibrant flavors, and nourishing benefits.\n\nThis diet focuses on antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables, fiber-packed whole grains, healthy fats like olive oil, plus lean and plant-based proteins. Those who follow it also limit their consumption of added sugars, refined grains, saturated fats, and excess sodium.\n\nOver time, I've perfected my Trader Joe's shopping routine to make preparing Mediterranean-inspired snacks and meals a breeze, regardless of how hectic life gets.\n\nHere are some of the staples I never leave Trader Joe's without and keep stocked in my Mediterranean-inspired kitchen.\n\nFinding a creamy dressing that tastes this good, doesn't contain artificial preservatives, and uses wholesome ingredients like cauliflower and dill is a huge win.\n\nI initially bought this for salads, but it has become one of the most versatile items in my fridge, thanks to its fresh, herby flavor that brightens up just about any dish.\n\nI like mixing a spoonful of Trader Joe's creamy dill dressing with a can of tuna and some chopped celery for a quick and light salad. It's also fantastic as a condiment on sandwiches or as a dip for fresh vegetables.\n\nThe Mediterranean diet encourages its followers to enjoy life's pleasures, which can include having a glass of quality red wine with dinner a few times a week.\n\nRed wine contains antioxidants, such as resveratrol, which some studies have linked to heart health benefits when consumed in moderation as part of a balanced diet.\n\nThis particular True Myth cabernet sauvignon is a fantastic pick that I've regularly found at Trader Joe's. It's smooth and full-bodied, making it a perfect companion for a plant-based pasta dish or to simply sip while I'm cooking.\n\nThough wine is an occasional treat, kombucha is my go-to beverage of choice — this fermented tea is brimming with probiotics.\n\nI typically pick up GT's Synergy kombucha at Trader Joe's because I love its bright, tangy flavor. I find it to be a refreshing, fizzy alternative to soda.\n\nGT's Synergy line, in particular, contains live cultures in every bottle, which are often associated with gut-health benefits.\n\nA healthy gut is a cornerstone of overall wellness, and the Mediterranean diet's focus on fiber-rich foods provides the perfect fuel for these good bacteria.\n\nI always have a bag of Trader Joe's freeze-dried blueberries in my pantry. They're lightweight and shelf-stable, making them a convenient way to add more fruit to my diet.\n\nPlus, the blueberries have an amazing concentrated flavor and a delightful crunch. I sprinkle them on my morning Greek yogurt, stir them into oatmeal, and add them to trail mix for a sweet kick.\n\nBlueberries are antioxidant powerhouses, and the freeze-drying process preserves their nutrients beautifully without any added sugar.\n\nAs a bonus, each serving (which is the whole bag) contains 7 grams of fiber.\n\nNuts are a core component of the Mediterranean diet, celebrated for their healthy fats, protein, and fiber.\n\nThis specific mix from Trader Joe's — a combination of almonds, cashews, and pecans tossed with savory herbs and olive pieces — is my absolute favorite.\n\nThese nuts are perfect for staving off afternoon hunger, adding a satisfying crunch to a cheese board, or chopping up to sprinkle over a salad. There's a little taste of the Mediterranean in every handful.",

    "title": "We took out a $300,000 loan at 23 to build a wellness cabin. We had no idea what we were getting into.",
    "description": "Rajan Chidambaram and Renzo Sanio bought a property and built a cabin. After getting input on social media, they leaned into adding wellness amenities.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rajan Chidambaram and Renzo Sanio, two 23-year-olds who built a cabin and turned it into a wellness retreat in Front Royal, Virginia, a town about 70 miles outside Washington, DC. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nRenzo Sanio: When I got interested in real estate development, I was told that it's the riskiest way to play the real estate game, but you can create the most impact in the physical world.\n\nThey were not wrong about it being the riskiest way to play the real estate game.\n\nWhen you build something, everyone wants to have an influence over what you're building — from the county, to the local covenants for what siding you have, to the building code. Ultimately, everything lands on the owner to handle it all.\n\nWe had zero experience in handling these complications that came up when we started building our cabin. We're also not well capitalized — we'd been saving money to buy the property, but took out a $300,000 construction loan to build the cabin — so you can barely even call us a developer. We're just two college students who decided to take on a really big project while we were still in school and soon to graduate.\n\nI started to do some research and found that by 2030, one out of three travelers is going to decide to book a place based on its wellness offerings.\n\nThen Rajan made a video speaking about wellness, and it gained a lot of traction.\n\nA post shared by Rajan Chida (@chida.rajan)\n\nRajan Chidambaram: The video went ballistic. I had an insane amount of health influencers follow me — I had Kyrie Irving follow me off of that video. It was insane.\n\nTo this day, I don't fully understand why that video resonated so much, but it really brought to our attention that we can marry wellness with the type of asset that we're building. And, obviously, the demand is there, so we were like, \"This is just the angle that we want to go.\"\n\nSanio: It was always our plan to add a hot tub, a sauna, and a cold plunge, but now we're doing things like red light therapy inside the cabin.\n\nWe're also offering Normatec compression sleeves, and completely fleshing out the inside with sustainably sourced woods, non-toxic paints, non-toxic and fragrance-free soaps, all these little details.\n\nWe ended up landing about $30,000 over our expected budget, and that's just because as we grew on social media, we got more and more excited about the kinds of things that we could offer our guests.\n\nWe really got to splurge on those items because of all the attention we saw on social media. We thought we could offer guests a really good experience now because of all the demand.\n\nA post shared by Rajan Chida (@chida.rajan)\n\nChidambaram: We have a thesis that this is where society is shifting toward — especially with the rise of AI and all this other stuff. People are going to crave real experiences, so that's where our heads were at.\n\nSanio: There's this whole wave of AI and digital this, digital that, but we've really designed this space for it to be a way to disconnect from that. This space has no TV, and it has games and features inside that we've curated to have people really connect with themselves, but also connect with the people that they go there with.\n\nChidambaram: The growing pains have been more on learning the operational side of stuff, like fixing stuff for guests right before they come. There were a lot of things we didn't expect.\n\nHow can you even prepare for your power going out because the county was cutting down trees?\n\nIt's very cold up in the mountains, and one time we lost power for a couple of hours, and it froze one of our pipes to the hot tub.\n\nOur water comes out of a spigot, and it was properly insulated, but the outside of the spigot wasn't, so it froze.\n\nThree hours before a guest came, I drove up there and bought a heat gun. The hot tub needed to be filled in the next three hours, and I didn't have a choice. I started heating up the spigot, and the water came out.\n\nSo now we're thinking, how can we have the people in place to solve these unexpected problems that will happen? Because it's just not a matter of if — it's when.\n\nWe were also really delayed for about three months because of windows. Tariffs kind of hurt us. We were at a standstill for about three months.\n\nSanio: Our windows were fully framed, but you can't do any interior work until you're what's called \"dried in.\"\n\nBecause if you have holes in everything and gas in your windows, and then you install your electrical system, the rain's just going to get to it. So we couldn't do anything until those windows came in, and we got the windows from Poland, and the tariffs slowed down that import process, which is why we were held after three months.\n\nThen there was an inspection to test the air tightness of our build — which there's a regulation for. There's just so many regulations and so many inspections. It's not just one inspection at the end.\n\nAfter we started to look into the wellness themes, we really wanted to flood the space with natural light, so we signed a $6,000 change order to have two more skylights installed. There was no budget for it, it was just something that we knew we wanted to have.\n\nThe total build came out to about $350,000 for the first cabin — we plan to build more on the property — and the land was about $37,000. We spent about $16,000 on furniture, fixtures and equipment.\n\nChidambaram: We've had a handful of guests so far. All of December is booked out, plus more than half of January, and a good amount of February and March, too.\n\nSanio: January and February are the slowest months for short-term rentals, and we've been killing it. Rajan handles marketing, property management, and booking, and we've been 100% occupied for those months.\n\nChidambaram: Our nights are dynamically priced, so weekends are a lot more expensive than weekdays. We also use software that takes into account holidays.\n\nA good goal for 2026 is to try to hit an average of $450 a night. But right now, nights are going to be somewhere in the ballpark of $330 to $490.\n\nSanio: It's challenging doing something so complicated for the first time. We're doing something that's typically only reserved for people with a lot of experience in construction or real estate development.\n\nWe're encouraged by our online community — most of the audience that has followed along on social media are young people and aspiring entrepreneurs.\n\nChidambaram: They've seen our whole project come from literally nothing — like ugly trees and dirt to what it is now. I think that's a special connection that people feel to watching us grow.",

    "description": "Many of the fastest-growing jobs in the US involve AI, according to LinkedIn. Engineers topped the list, though not all AI roles are technical.",
    "fullText": "If finding a new job is on your to-do list in 2026, you might want to start with AI.\n\nArtificial intelligence engineers top LinkedIn's annual Jobs on the Rise list, which ranks the fastest-growing roles in the US over the past three years. The newly released findings also offer a snapshot of where employers are still hiring, from tech and infrastructure to sales and healthcare.\n\nJust as AI appears to be buoying the stock market, it's also supporting demand in various sectors of the labor market. There's other welcome news for desk workers who have faced years of sluggish hiring: Not all of the AI roles are wholly technical.\n\nThe category of AI consultants and strategists was the second-fastest-growing in LinkedIn's review.\n\nThat's an indication that integrating AI more deeply into the workplace will require people whose expertise isn't solely technical, said Laura Lorenzetti, a senior director at LinkedIn who worked on the list.\n\n\"There is also this whole adjacent system of how you implement AI; how you do culture change around AI; how you get people to really adapt and use it,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nOther roles related to AI also feature prominently on the ranking of fast-growing jobs. Data annotators, who help train and refine AI systems, were fourth on the list, while AI and machine learning researchers came in at No. 5.\n\nNot all of the top spots were directly tied to AI, however. The third-fastest-growing job type was \"new home sales specialists,\" while healthcare reimbursement specialists were sixth.\n\nAlongside the list, LinkedIn also reported on Wednesday that, in a November survey, more than half of workers — 56% — said they planned to look for a new job in 2026, although about three-quarters of respondents felt unprepared to do so.\n\nThey cited reasons such as being unsure about how to stand out or not being ready for how technology is shifting in-demand skills.\n\nIn a prior LinkedIn survey from about a year ago, a similar share of workers signaled their intent to hunt for a job — a reminder that looking isn't the same as landing.\n\nMore than six in 10 of the 2,000 respondents said that finding a job had grown more challenging over the prior year. They cited factors such as competition, skills gaps, and uncertainty over which jobs they might be qualified for.\n\nOther LinkedIn data highlighted the challenges in the job market for many people: The number of applicants per open role has, on average, more than doubled since the spring of 2022, while hiring was 23% below pre-pandemic levels as of November.\n\nThe difficulty in finding work, especially after years of cuts in Big Tech and as firms ramp up investments in AI, is causing some to reconsider their approach to their job hunt. Nearly half of job seekers — 46% — said in the survey that they'd gone from looking for full-time work to freelance, contract, or advising gigs.\n\nLed by Gen Z, nearly one in five professionals who reported being unable to find a new job in 2025 said they had shifted to freelance or consulting work, or had started their own business.\n\nThat could be one reason the job title \"founder\" is surging on LinkedIn profiles — and appearing on the list of fastest-growing jobs for the first time, in the ninth spot.\n\nLinkedIn reported in December that the share of US users who added founder to their profile had jumped 69% from the prior year.\n\n\"People are seeing that as a way to own their career and own their next step,\" said Lorenzetti, referring to the interest in entrepreneurship.\n\nHere are the 25 fastest-growing roles in the US, according to LinkedIn:",

    "description": "The tanker, originally called Bella 1, evaded a US naval blockade of sanctioned vessels near Venezuela last month.",
    "fullText": "The US military said on Wednesday that American forces finally seized a Russia-flagged oil tanker in the North Atlantic after pursuing the vessel across the ocean in a highly unusual chase.\n\nThe tanker, originally called the Bella 1, evaded a US naval blockade of sanctioned vessels near Venezuela last month, avoiding attempts by the American military to board the vessel.\n\nThe ship, described by officials as a \"dark fleet\" tanker operating in violation of sanctions, then fled into the Atlantic, setting off a dramatic two-week chase. It changed its name to Marinera and reflagged, painting the Russian tricolor on the ship's hull.\n\nUS European Command said in a statement on Wednesday that the oil tanker was seized \"pursuant to a warrant issued by a US federal court\" after it was tracked by the US Coast Guard cutter Munro.\n\nThe seizure supports the Trump administration's efforts to target \"sanctioned vessels that threaten the security and stability of the Western Hemisphere,\" the military said.\n\nIt added that the seizure operation was executed by the Department of Homeland Security with support from the Pentagon, \"showcasing a whole-of-government approach to protect the homeland.\"\n\nFlight-tracking data reviewed by Business Insider revealed a flurry of US military aircraft were airborne either shortly before or during the operation.\n\nAt least three Pilatus U-28A Draco aircraft, planes used by US Air Force Special Operations Command for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, were observed flying north of Scotland.\n\nAn Air Force KC-135 Stratotanker refueling aircraft and a US Navy P-8 Poseidon aircraft — the latter of which specializes in submarine-hunting missions and maritime patrol — took off from a base in southeastern England and were seen flying off Scotland's northwestern coast.\n\nThe British government said it supported the US seizure, including by providing aerial surveillance, but it's unclear if any other nations participated in the effort. A NATO official said that the alliance was uninvolved in any active operations involving the ship.\n\n\"NATO tracks the activities of shadow fleet vessels closely to enhance maritime situational awareness,\" an alliance official told Business Insider. \"However, there is no current involvement by NATO's standing naval forces in these operations.\"\n\nRussian state-run broadcaster RT published photographs showing a helicopter near the Marinera, adding that military forces believed to be American were attempting to board the tanker. Business Insider could not independently verify the details of the images.\n\nSeveral US media outlets reported that Russia had dispatched naval forces to escort the tanker as it approached the waters between the UK and Iceland. It appears, however, that the US reached the vessel first. The two nations did not engage in confrontation.\n\nRussia's transportation ministry confirmed that the US boarded the tanker in international waters and said it lost all communication with the vessel.\n\n\"No state possesses the right to employ force against vessels that are lawfully registered under the jurisdiction of another state,\" the ministry said in a statement shared by state media outlet Tass.\n\nMeanwhile, the US military announced on Wednesday that it seized another vessel — \"a stateless, sanctioned dark fleet motor tanker\" — near South America.\n\nUS Southern Command said the vessel, M/T Sophia, was operating in international waters and \"conducting illicit activities\" in the Caribbean Sea. American forces are escorting it to the US.\n\nThe Trump administration last month announced a naval blockade on sanctioned oil tankers trying to enter or leave Venezuela as part of a pressure campaign against the country's then-President Nicolás Maduro. The two interdictions on Wednesday mark the latest in a string of vessel seizures under the policy.\n\n\"The United States continues to enforce the blockade against all dark fleet vessels illegally transporting Venezuelan oil to finance illicit activity, stealing from the Venezuelan people,\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said.\n\n\"Only legitimate and lawful energy commerce—as determined by the US—will be permitted,\" he added.\n\nThe seizures come just a few days after the US military executed a large-scale covert raid in Venezuela to apprehend Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.",

Berkshire Hathaway is one contender thanks to its large bet on Chevron.\n\n\"Berkshire should benefit from its 6% stake in Chevron, since it is the only US oil major in Venezuela,\" David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland who's closely followed Berkshire for more than four decades, told Business Insider.\n\nBerkshire — now led by Greg Abel following Warren Buffett's recent retirement as CEO — is Chevron's largest corporate shareholder with a 6% stake worth about $19 billion, assuming Berkshire hasn't altered the wager since its latest portfolio update.\n\nThe conglomerate counted the oil major as its fifth-largest stock position at the end of September 2025, representing about 7% of the total $267 billion value of its US stock portfolio.\n\nVenezuela has the world's largest proven crude oil reserves, but decades of underinvestment in its oil infrastructure mean it only produces about 1% of global oil output.\n\nChevron has secured short-term exemptions to US sanctions on Venezuela, allowing it to produce and export limited amounts of the country's oil.\n\nRivals, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, left Venezuela years ago following the nationalization of the country's oil industry and government seizures of foreign-owned assets.\n\nTrump said over the weekend that he envisions large US oil companies coming to Venezuela, fixing and modernizing its pipelines and refineries, and supercharging the country's oil production.\n\nExcited investors piled into oil stocks on Monday. Chevron shares surged as much as 6.3% on the day to a nine-month high of about $166, briefly valuing Berkshire's stake at over $20 billion. They retreated on Tuesday but are still up nearly 3% so far in 2026.\n\nChevron already has stakes in five production projects in Venezuela, thanks to partnerships with affiliates of the country's state oil company.\n\nOn an earnings call in August, CEO Mike Wirth highlighted Chevron's deep foothold in the country. He said it has been operating in Venezuela for more than a century, and has \"played an important role in regional energy security, as well as maintaining American economic interests.\"\n\nChevron's presence in Venezuela means it \"stands to benefit from any reopening,\" Maurizio Carulli, a global energy analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said in a Tuesday note.\n\nThe oil major has the personnel, licenses, and oil fields \"ready to ramp up immediately,\" Charles-Henry Monchau, CIO of Syz Group, also said in a note on Tuesday.\n\nIndustry analysts have warned it will take years and huge sums to revitalize Venezuela's oil sector, and US companies won't want to invest heavily until they're confident they won't have assets seized or contracts changed down the line.\n\nThat suggests Venezuela won't be an overnight game changer for Chevron or Berkshire.\n\nBerkshire has further exposure to the oil industry via Occidental Petroleum, its next-largest stock holding after Chevron. It owns more than a quarter of the energy explorer and producer — a stake worth $11 billion today.\n\nA Chevron spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement: \"Chevron remains focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets. We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\"",

    "description": "AgileRL has created a platform for engineers to train AI using reinforcement learning, a decades-old technique that's having a comeback.",
    "fullText": "A London-based startup that provides software to help companies speed up AI training has raised $7.5 million in funding.\n\nAgileRL has created a platform called Arena that engineers and data scientists can drop their AI models into, run simulations, fine-tune them before deployment, and monitor them while they are running.\n\nThe startup, cofounded by Param Kumar and Nicholas Ustaran-Anderegg in 2023, focuses on reinforcement learning, or RL, an AI training technique in which systems learn by trying actions and improving based on the feedback they receive.\n\nReinforcement learning has roots dating back to the 1950s, but at AI labs, it is experiencing a renaissance of sorts.\n\nKumar, AgileRL's CEO, told Business Insider that after ChatGPT launched in late 2022, companies \"moved their budgets from working on RL\" to focus on transformers, the technology underpinning large language models. Where transformers learn patterns from large datasets all at once, RL learns one step at a time. Now, he says more companies are realizing that transformers can only get them so far.\n\n\"We realized early on that transformers are great, but they're these large statistical models,\" Kumar said. \"The reality is you will need to layer on RL on top of that, because there's only so much you can infer from the data.\"\n\nKumar gave the example of a robotic arm being tasked with moving a ball from one table to another. He said that the movement can be broken down into many smaller tasks — such as grasping the ball, lifting the arm, and moving the joint — and that AgileRL's platform allows engineers to set parameters to improve at those specific tasks.\n\nThe startup says it can speed up AI development for companies because the training tools are all in one place and off the shelf, versus setting up an AI lab from scratch.\n\nAgileRL offers a free tier, which provides users with access to a limited amount of training credits. Paid tiers are available for businesses and professionals, along with custom licenses for larger enterprises.\n\nThe company says its platform has been downloaded more than 300,000 times, and it has been used by companies including Airbus, IBM, and JPMorgan.\n\nAgileRL's seed funding round was led by Fusion Fund, with participation from Flying Fish, Octopus Ventures, Entrepreneur First, and Counterview Capital.\n\nThe startup said it plans to use the capital to open an office in San Francisco and hire more than a dozen people in engineering and go-to-market roles.\n\nHere's an exclusive look at the 12-page pitch deck AgileRL used to raise $7.5 million.",

    "description": "Food trends for 2026 include sweet-and-spicy flavors, bite-sized menu items, cabbage, and fast-casual Indian cuisine.",
    "fullText": "The new year brings a fresh crop of food trends, from sweet-and-spicy sauces to the hottest new vegetable hitting menus.\n\nWe looked at trend reports from Tastewise, Pinterest, Yelp, and more to identify nine of the biggest food trends you can expect to see in 2026.\n\nA few trends are informed by health attitudes and the rise of GLP-1 medications, like bite-sized versions of menu items and mocktails that reflect Gen Z's attitude toward alcohol.\n\nPrice and affordability also continue to be top of mind, but \"value\" — not just the price alone, but the amount of food you get for it — is a concept that fast-food chains and casual-dining restaurants are leaning into more than ever.\n\nHere are nine food trends that will be everywhere in 2026.\n\nWhile plant-based meat may have had its moment in the early 2020s — and while some leaders in the space remain optimistic — there's been a decline in sales year over year for popular plant-powered meat companies. For some, such as Beyond Meat, sales have been declining for a few years.\n\nAt the same time, 2026 trend reports highlight a return to \"real meat,\" with chefs and diners gravitating toward menu items such as steak frites, signature burgers, and wagyu beef to attract customers seeking to incorporate more protein into their diets.\n\nAccording to Tastewise's 2026 Trend Forecast, \"Consumers are turning away from 'fakeness' in ultra-processed substitutes, seeking foods that feel simple, transparent, and true to their origins,\" especially among fast-food menus, where meat-focused menu items have grown 11% year over year.\n\nMove over, kale: 2026 is poised to be the year of the cabbage.\n\nFrom kimchi dishes to cabbage spring rolls and salads, cabbage is gaining popularity among home cooks and restaurant owners, who have lauded the ingredient's versatility and affordability, as well as its high fiber content.\n\n\"Today's consumer is more open to exploring global cuisines than ever. Cabbage's versatility comes in handy, as it can be a part of tacos, rice bowls, noodles, and other culturally relevant dishes,\" Wesley Allan, a consumer insights analyst at Tastewise, told Business Insider.\n\nPinterest also reported that searches for cabbage dumplings have increased by 110%, and cabbage-focused dishes, such as golumpki, a Polish soup made from cabbage, ground beef, and tomato broth, are also seeing increased interest as we head into 2026.\n\nIn addition to protein, fiber-rich foods like Brussels sprouts, broccoli, sweet potatoes, legumes, and whole grains are enjoying popularity due to their ability to promote fullness and satiate appetites for longer compared to other foods.\n\nWhile naturally fiber-rich foods are increasingly appearing on restaurant menus, the \"fiber-maxing\" trend is also making its way into grocery aisles.\n\nShoppers can expect to see more packaged foods marketed for their fiber content, with new products like Smartfood Fiber Pop and SunChips Fiber signaling how brands are leaning into the trend.\n\nHowever, it's recommended you don't go all in right away: Dieticians warn against introducing too much fiber to your diet too quickly, which can cause digestive issues like constipation, abdominal pain, and nausea.\n\nFast-casual chains with Chipotle-style build-your-own concepts inspired by Indian cuisine, such as Inday, are helping introduce dishes like chicken tikka masala, paneer, and chickpea curry in approachable, on-the-go formats that are revolutionizing the \"slop bowl\" with new and innovative flavors.\n\nInday has experienced significant growth over the past few years, particularly since acquiring the vegan fast-casual concept Beatnic in 2024 and converting all of the brand's locations into Inday restaurants.\n\nSimilar expansion at Curry Up Now — a fast-casual Indian chain with 19 locations — underscores how fast-casual brands in the Indian category are positioning for national growth.\n\nWith the rise of GLP-1 medications, many customers are seeking smaller menu items in response to their reduced appetites. And, with 10% of the US population on some form of GLP-1, according to Rob Holston, the global and Americas consumer products sector leader at EY, the market for smaller, snackier menu items could be bigger than ever.\n\nLast year, McDonald's relaunched its iconic snack wraps in two flavors: spicy and ranch. While the new menu items hit the sweet spot in terms of affordability and nostalgia — two of the biggest food trends of 2025 — they also catered to something customers are craving: smaller, on-the-go items that aren't overly filling.\n\nEarlier this month, Shake Shack launched its new \"Good Fit Menu,\" featuring a variety of lettuce-wrapped burgers and chicken sandwiches for customers \"dialing up protein, cutting back, or simply eating with more intention.\"\n\nOther mini versions of popular products — such as snack-sized chip bags and Coke's mini cans — could also be seen in more stores this year as consumers seek smaller portions.\n\nRather than skipping drinks altogether, many younger consumers are opting for zero-proof cocktails that still feel special, meeting up with friends at dirty-soda shops, or opting for THC-infused drinks.\n\nAnother drinking trend among younger consumers is \"zebra-striping,\" in which you alternate between an alcoholic and a non-alcoholic drink each round.\n\n\"People still want to feel something,\" Jon Kreidler, cofounder of Tattersall Distilling Company, told Business Insider. \"They still want to partake and have something adult and feel something different to help them relax, help them calm down. But a lot of people, especially younger consumers, are just fed up with the hangovers and the negative effects, and so they're shifting away from alcohol.\"\n\nValue menus dominated fast food and casual dining in 2025 as inflation-weary consumers demanded more for their money, and the focus on affordability isn't going anywhere in 2026.\n\nChains have leaned into lower-priced bundles and fan-favorite deals to keep customers coming back, with McDonald's expanding its $5 Meal Deal, reviving snack wraps, and rolling out new Extra Value meal combos.\n\nCasual-dining brands followed suit, with Applebee's launching a value-focused lunch special, Olive Garden reintroducing its Endless Pasta option, and Chili's continuing to promote its popular \"3 for Me\" deal.\n\nAs consumers remain price-conscious, value-driven offerings continue to be popular among customers who want more value for their money.\n\nHot honey has firmly cemented itself as a go-to flavor across fast-food and casual-dining menus, building on years of steady growth.\n\nQSR magazine previously reported that menu mentions of hot honey jumped 187% between 2016 and 2020 — and the trend shows no signs of cooling off.\n\nIn recent months, chains including Red Robin, Chipotle, Panda Express, KFC, and Taco Bell have rolled out hot-honey-inspired items, often in partnership with Mike's Hot Honey, indicating that the sweet-heat flavor has evolved from a trend to a staple.\n\nFrom Burger King's \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" collab to McDonald's retro-inspired Happy Meal toys, chains across the board leaned into nostalgia in 2025 — and the trend isn't going anywhere.\n\nBeyond obvious plays, like Taco Bell's \"Decades Y2K\" menu, chains are leaning into menu items that simply evoke a nostalgic or childhood feeling of simpler times, such as chicken tenders.\n\nTechnomic's Lizzy Freier told Restaurant Business that chicken tenders are surging across foodservice because they hit multiple consumer sweet spots at once: They're familiar, nostalgic, affordable, and appeal to both kids and adults, while new dipping sauces help keep the format feeling fresh.\n\nAs we enter the new year, other nostalgic foods like milkshakes and sweet desserts could see similar rises in popularity.",

    "description": "After many cruises, I've learned what isn't worth paying for on ships. From drink packages to excursions, here's what I don't waste money on.",
    "fullText": "I've taken over 50 cruises on nearly a dozen different lines over the past 15 or so years.\n\nNo matter what ship I'm on, some extras and experiences aren't worth the price.\n\nHere are the things I never buy on a cruise.\n\nMost major cruise lines, like Carnival and Royal Caribbean, offer drink packages.\n\nThey vary significantly across companies and tiers — some cruise lines offer travelers 15 drinks a day, while others have no daily limit. Prices also vary, though I've seen many cost about $70 to $100 a day.\n\nUnfortunately, on every cruise I've been on, everyone (of legal drinking age) in the same stateroom has to make the same decision on drink packages. Even if you're traveling with someone who doesn't drink, they would still have to pay for a package if you want one.\n\nUltimately, I don't drink enough to justify spending hundreds of extra dollars for drink packages on a cruise.\n\nInstead, I stick to ordering my beverages à la carte. It saves me money and makes me really think about what I'm ordering.\n\nIf room service is no extra charge, I'd definitely take advantage of it. However, these days, I've found it typically costs extra to have food delivered to your cabin.\n\nInstead of paying the fees, I'll head to one of the included dining options — often a buffet or main dining room — when I'm hungry to get snacks or meals.\n\nIf I really want to eat in my cabin because I need some downtime or want to watch a movie, I ask the staff if there are any take-out options available.\n\nI also take food to quiet areas on the ship, like adults-only pools, if I want a chill spot that's not my room.\n\nIt can be tricky to keep track of your room key, which usually doubles as a form of payment and ID to get on and off the ship.\n\nMost cruise lines have an abundance of lanyards for sale as a remedy, but I don't think they're worth it.\n\nInstead, I just put my key card inside my phone case. Since I always have my phone with me, I also always have my room key.\n\nOne of the biggest expenses of a cruise, besides the actual booking, is excursions. Cruise lines offer dozens at ports of call around the world, but they're often very expensive for a solo traveler, let alone a family.\n\nInstead, I like to explore the ports on my own or with a third-party excursion company. These excursions are typically more affordable and offer comparable experiences, and I always read a lot of reviews before booking.\n\nThe biggest perk of booking excursions through a cruise line is that the ship waits for you to get back if you're running late.\n\nSo, if you're going the third-party route, be sure your excursion will get you back to the ship at least an hour before it's set to depart so you don't get left behind.\n\nThis story was originally published on February 27, 2024, and most recently updated on January 7, 2026.",

    "fullText": "Warner Bros. Discovery just rejected David Ellison's takeover offer for the eighth time — and its CEO is telling employees why.\n\nWBD CEO David Zaslav sent a companywide memo on Wednesday morning, which was viewed by Business Insider, explaining why WBD is sticking with its Netflix deal.\n\nZaslav told staffers that WBD's board of directors did a \"thorough review\" of Paramount's latest offer and said they believe Netflix's offer is still superior.\n\n\"This review was conducted with discipline and rigor, and was supported by independent financial and legal advisors,\" Zaslav told employees.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders on Wednesday, WBD's board outlined two key reasons it was turning down Paramount's updated offer. First, the board said it offered \"insufficient value\" relative to Netflix's bid, due to additional costs like a break-up fee to Netflix. Second, they said there was a \"lack of certainty\" in Paramount's ability to consummate the deal because of an \"extraordinary amount of debt financing.\"\n\nParamount's latest deal had included $40.4 billion in equity fully backstopped by Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison and one of the richest people in the world.\n\nIn Zaslav's memo to staffers, he said the company's \"operating plans remain unchanged, and our priorities for 2026 are clear and intentional.\"\n\nWBD's CEO also encouraged employees to tune out the noise.\n\n\"What matters most right now is our focus as we start the year,\" Zaslav said, before thanking staffers for the \"focus, professionalism, and energy\" they bring to work.\n\nHe said the 2026 goals process for the company would launch in February.\n\nRead Zaslav's full memo to staffers here:\n\nThis communication has been sent to everyone at WBD.\n\nAs we begin the year, I want to share an update on where things stand and where we are focused.\n\nFollowing a thorough review, the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors has completed its consideration of Paramount Skydance's most recent proposal. After careful evaluation, the Board has determined not to pursue that proposal. You can read our statement here.\n\nThis review was conducted with discipline and rigor, and was supported by independent financial and legal advisors.\n\nWe continue to have a signed transaction agreement with Netflix, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. The regulatory review process is underway, and during this period we will continue to operate the business and support our teams. For reference, a centralized collection of what we have previously shared on this topic is available on the One website.\n\nWhat matters most right now is our focus as we start the year. Our operating plans remain unchanged, and our priorities for 2026 are clear and intentional. The 2026 Goals process will be launched in February.\n\nAcross film, television, sports, news, streaming and games, we are delivering against a slate and strategy we believe strongly in. The work underway across the company reflects the creativity, momentum, and global reach that define us.\n\nThank you for the focus, professionalism, and energy you bring to your work. We enter this year confident in our direction and energized by what we are building for audiences and partners around the world.",

Its ranking also considered factors like housing availability, whether the city had a community of young people, the average estimated commute time, and affordability, which was weighted as one of the most important factors in Realtor.com's analysis.\n\nAffordability remains one of the largest barriers to Americans trying to break into the housing market for the first time.\n\nThe 30-year mortgage rate clocked in at around 6.15% in the last week of 2025, according to data from Freddie Mac — still elevated compared to levels over the last decade, particularly during the pandemic, when many home loans were going for under 3%.\n\nThe median sales price of a US home, meanwhile, hovered around $410,800 in the second quarter of last year, according to US Census data, close to a record high.\n\nHere are the cities where Realtor.com thinks first-time buyers could catch a break.\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 21.3%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 21 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 23\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 19.9%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 23 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 37.9\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 13.0%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 25 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 47.8\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 18.9%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 24 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 43.5\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 17.4%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 23 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 39.2\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 20.4%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 20 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 21.0\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 19.1%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 31 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 52.6\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 25.2%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 22 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 42.4\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 23.5%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 25 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 33.7\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 12.4%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 24 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 50.2",

    "description": "AI slop is everywhere — except it's not so sloppy anymore. Just take a look at Instagram or TikTok. A lot of it looks real. That's where you come in.",
    "fullText": "There was a time, not so long ago, when AI-generated content was very easy to spot. It was surreal, ridiculous — like Jesus made out of Shrimp.\n\nWe're in a new time now, and AI slop looks so good, it's hard to tell from the real thing. I've been fooled by it. You probably have, too, even if you don't think you have. For example, this extremely realistic video of Nicolás Maduro doing TikTok dances in prison with Diddy. You know it's AI only because it's improbable, not because the video quality is poor.\n\n2025: “AI will be used to cure cancer”\n\n2026:\n\n pic.twitter.com/u6KbygoLtm\n\nSo in a post-slop world, what comes next? What does our future look like with AI?\n\nOne person who would know something about both is Instagram head Adam Mosseri, who posted a prediction to Threads: He says AI images, text, and videos will get more and more realistic, and it'll become harder to separate them from what's real — including on the platform he oversees.\n\n(That's already happening to some extent: Long are the days when it was easy to spot a \"Shrimp Jesus\"-like AI-generated picture.)\n\nWhat I appreciate about Mosseri's memo is that he seems optimistic about what probably sounds like a bad thing to most people. Admitting his platform will be filled with AI-generated content meant to fool people — for funsies or profit — should, theoretically, be taking an L. But he sees this as a problem that can be solved (on Instagram, at least) at the product level:\n\nHis other point is that people will naturally gravitate toward human-produced content because that's what will become trendy: authentic, less polished, intimate, real.\n\n\"Authenticity is fast becoming a scarce resource, which will in turn drive more demand for creator content, not less,\" he writes. Which is certainly a hopeful message if your job is to run a platform for creator content and you're trying to reassure creators (and advertisers) that they should continue to post authentic content to your platform.\n\nI think he's generally right. The idea that human-created content will become more premium amid a flood of machine-created content seems to be the prevailing wisdom.\n\nAnother optimistic prognostication comes from OpenAI's chief economist, Aaron \"Ronnie\" Chatterji, who told the Financial Times that he believes AI will help free us from mundane household chores.\n\nLook, I love the sound of that as much as anyone, but I'm skeptical. Sure, someone is working on a robot that folds clothes, but it seems like it'll be a long time before that's a real thing for most of us. And it's hard to imagine automation doing the chores I really hate, like scrubbing toilets or sorting through the piles of papers and junk that accumulate on countertops daily. And I am highly, highly skeptical of a robot helping with childcare.\n\nMeanwhile, Ben Thompson of Stratechery also seems to fall into the \"humans rock!\" side of things, which I find much more appealing as a human.\n\nHe wrote about a Substack essay that had been going viral among a subset of influential people who care about economics and AI. The essay suggested that once AI and automation make it so that humans no longer have to work, income inequality will actually be far worse.\n\nBut Thompson thinks that even if there's an exponentially bigger gap between the haves and have-nots in the year 2126 (which doesn't sound great on paper), we will still value and prize human labor precisely because it is human. He writes:\n\nI like the sound of this! It's quite self-serving to me, a human who creates something (writing words) that I suppose could be done by AI, but you would probably hate and not want to pay for if it were. And also as a human being who would like to keep the species going for another few generations, I suppose. I like to think this is hope rather than cope.",

    "fullText": "She looked like a princess in her Miss Sohee gown.\n\nIt had a sweetheart bodice with off-the-shoulder sleeves, a plunging neckline, and a full, shiny skirt that puffed around the hips.\n\nShe wore it with an elegant matte makeup look and a curly, old-school bob.\n\nThe 27-year-old actor arrived at the film festival wearing a vintage gown from Nettie Rosenstein Couture.\n\nThe metallic piece had a pleated bodice, a matching floor-length skirt, and off-the-shoulder sleeves that extended above her collarbone.\n\nThough the gown's color suited Fanning, its modest silhouette aged the young actor. Another vintage piece — maybe from the '70s instead of the '50s — might have worked better.\n\nDolce & Gabbana designed the three-piece set he wore. It included loose-fitting velvet pants, a matching blazer with a satin lining, and a soft vest worn underneath.\n\nThe suit was complemented by black velvet loafers, aviator sunglasses, a satin undershirt, and an assortment of fine jewelry from David Yurman.\n\nColman's outfit was chic, on trend, and the epitome of quiet luxury.\n\nThe \"Happy Gilmore\" star posed on the red carpet wearing a jewel-toned suit with a matching purple tie. Though the outfit was eye-catching, it was also arguably too flashy.\n\nHis wife, Jackie Sandler, had a stronger fashion moment in a strapless, gold gown with a black lace overlay. Still, her outfit would have been stronger if she'd worn a darker slip beneath the top layer.\n\nHer dark ensemble was designed by Haider Ackermann for Tom Ford.\n\nIt featured pleated trousers that were tailored perfectly to the musician, a satin blazer with sharp shoulder pads, and a polka-dot blouse with a plunging neckline that reached her stomach.\n\nHe wore a classic suit for the film festival, pairing a black blazer and trousers with a white undershirt and tie.\n\nThough he undoubtedly looked dapper at the event's red carpet, his outfit was too understated. It's unlikely to be remembered alongside brighter, more artistic fashion choices.\n\nShe wore a sparkling Georges Chakra gown. The semi-sheer piece had a sleeveless, backless bodice with a deep V-shaped neckline, a floor-length skirt, and a wrap belt that draped across the floor.\n\nThe dress proved that red is Hudson's color.\n\nThe actor attended the festival in a strapless, leather midi dress. It had a high-low skirt with delicate pleats and a form-fitting bodice.\n\nUnfortunately, the dress was styled too simply. It would have been more impactful if worn with an updo hairstyle and statement jewelry.",

    "fullText": "It's a new year on Wall Street, and Bank of America predicts a shift is coming for some companies in the financials sector of the stock market.\n\nThe bank predicts a comeback year for alternative investing stocks after a tough 2025. According to analysts, the US economic situation has set the stage for alternative assets such as private credit, private equity, and infrastructure to surge.\n\nMany names in the space quietly struggled last year, pushed down by narrative and technical factors that dented confidence among investors.\n\nAccording to BofA analyst Craig Siegenthaler, though, this has created a key buying opportunity for savvy investors. The combination of lower valuations and a stronger macro backdrop suggests that alternative asset managers are primed for growth in the coming year—and that their stocks are set to climb.\n\nNotably, the private credit industry was in the crosshairs at the end of last year, coming under fire after the collapse of two high-profile borrowers exposed potential risks in the market. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon now famously quipped that there were likely many more \"cockroaches\" lurking in the sector.\n\nBut now Siegenthaler thinks alternative investment firms and their stocks are ready to rally.\n\n\"We are more bullish on the Alts due to better valuation/positioning setup combined with stronger macro backdrop (IPOs/M&A, Fed cuts) and Alt stock tax-loss harvesting headwinds will likely reverse on January 1,\" he wrote in a note to investors.\n\nMany of the alternative investing stocks that BofA is bullish on have performed well in the first week of 2026, though they remain in the red for the year.\n\nHere are the bank's list of top alternative investing stock picks:\n\nPart of Siegenthaler's bullish thesis on alt stocks centers on the fact that he believes investors overreacted to the high-profile bankruptcies at the end of last year.\n\nHe said that some of the negative sentiment toward the industry was fueled by misinformation that negatively impacted valuations and growth trajectories for alternative asset managers' stocks.\n\n\"Our Alts Examiner files are pointing towards growing realization/deployment pipelines while our Retail Alts Calculator disclosed that ARES's & OWL's credit strategies still had strong flows in 4Q25 despite private credit misinformation,\" he added.",

    "description": "I never thought I'd find my forever home in the Midwest, but I fell in love with a small, affordable town in Wisconsin that I love more than Florida.",
    "fullText": "After growing up in North Carolina, I moved to St. Petersburg, Florida, at the age of 18 for college. That's where I fell in love with my now-fiancée — and the surrounding Pinellas County.\n\nWe both adored Florida's beaches, took regular weekend trips to Key West and Manasota Key, and thoroughly enjoyed life in the Tampa Bay area.\n\nAt times, I thought we might just stay there forever — but after graduation, the world felt wide open. So, we started \"shopping around\" the country for a new place to call home.\n\nMy partner and I packed up my truck and started our adventure by road-tripping across the Western United States.\n\nWe camped in the Badlands, swam in the Yellowstone River, slept in a canyon in Idaho, and in 2020, landed in Portland, Oregon.\n\nPortland was the epitome of cool — the kind of place where you could hike in the morning, grab a craft beer at night, and feel like you were living the hipster dream.\n\nHowever, after six months, I found myself struggling with poor air quality from local wildfires and missing the familiarity of St. Pete.\n\nSo, we moved back to Florida, hoping to relive our college days with close friends and potentially settle down.\n\nHowever, my fiancée and I struggled to put down roots.\n\nPinellas County and its housing market had undergone significant changes while we'd been away. Homes were selling for significantly more than they had been a few years ago, and many of those prices were far beyond our budget.\n\nThe rental market remained competitive as ever, too. We ended up renting a 400-square-foot ADU in the area for about $1,100 a month. At the time, it was the only place we found within our budget that had in-unit laundry and a decent location.\n\nWe made it work, and I even became friends with my landlord and his wife. However, heavy rain routinely flooded part of the unit, and after one particularly severe hurricane, the carpet was so soaked it had to be removed.\n\nBetween the worsening storms and rising house (and insurance) prices in the area, the idea of buying our first home here felt increasingly unrealistic.\n\nWe'd already been spooked by Hurricane Irma in 2017, and this felt like a small taste of the possible issues to come if we stayed.\n\nFortunately, by this point, I had a solid remote job, and we'd been building up our savings to put toward a down payment on a house.\n\nNow, we had to figure out where to go next.\n\nMy fiancée suggested we move to southern Wisconsin, near where her family lived. Real estate was cheaper there, and we could stay with her parents while house-hunting.\n\nI agreed, we moved, and we're still happily here years later.\n\nOur lives immediately felt different in a southern Wisconsin county with a population of about 100,000, in a town of less than 10,000.\n\nAfter living in one of the most densely populated counties in Florida, home to nearly 1 million people, I was thrilled to find a quieter place to call home.\n\nI've also fallen in love with the Wisconsin outdoors and all the adventures it has to offer. I've hiked Kettle Moraine State Forest, surfed on Lake Michigan, tested new fishing holes, and explored the lakes I'd only heard about before moving.\n\nThe locals seemed to welcome us instantly, and the community feels rich and full of life — new businesses always seem to be opening: a huge coffee shop, a speakeasy bar, and even a high-end restaurant.\n\nPlus, the local \"lake life\" offered the same laid-back vibe we used to enjoy finding around Florida's beaches.\n\nSoon, we bought a four-bedroom house in the area, securing a mortgage that costs us less than $1,500 a month.\n\nIn less than a year, we'd gone from living in someone else's tiny suite to having our very own four-bedroom home for a comparable monthly cost. We could hardly believe it.\n\nSure, winters can be a lot colder and tougher out in the Midwest, and we sometimes miss Florida, but I like the life we've built.\n\nI always say if the hipsters in Portland or the beach bums in Florida knew about small-town Wisconsin, they'd move here in a heartbeat (or at least visit in the summers).",

    "description": "Once one of the world's richest nations, Venezuela has faced a decadeslong collapse that triggered one of the largest migrations in history.",
    "fullText": "Half a century ago, Venezuela was one of the world's richest nations. Today, decades of economic collapse have driven nearly a quarter of its population to flee the country.\n\nOn January 3, the US launched a military operation in Venezuela that resulted in the capture of President Nicolás Maduro. He pleaded not guilty to narco-terrorism and weapons-related charges in New York on Monday.\n\nThe seizure of the country's leader, which Venezuelan officials have called a \"kidnapping,\" has raised questions about sovereignty and legality, as well as Venezuela's political and economic future.\n\nThe country, which has the largest proven oil reserves in the world, estimated at about a fifth of the world's total, produces less than 1% of the global oil production today, due to what President Donald Trump has called \"badly broken infrastructure.\"\n\nUS officials have said they will seek to influence Venezuela's transitional government and attract investment from American energy companies to help revive its collapsed oil sector.\n\nDuring the 1950s and more dramatically in the 1970s, Venezuela experienced periods of vast oil-fueled economic growth — nicknamed by historians as \"Saudi Venezuela\" — where luxury, foreign travel, and modernization defined a growing middle class.\n\nAt the same time, the dramatic wealth of the era left some behind, highlighting the visible inequalities that contributed to a shift in domestic politics by the end of the century.\n\nThese vintage photos capture what life in Venezuela was like during its decades of oil-fueled economic prosperity and how the country evolved as its economy boomed.\n\nThe first oil discovery in Venezuela was made near Lake Maracaibo in 1914. The national oil industry experienced exponential growth throughout the 1920s and 1930s, as foreign investments began to pour into the country.\n\nThe oil industry's boom transformed the country's economy, which had previously primarily been a coffee exporter.\n\nThe growing oil industry concentrated jobs and investment in the country's capital, drawing migrants from rural areas and smaller cities in search of work and opportunity.\n\n\"There was a growing, expansive, and increasingly influential middle class that established itself in the oil industry,\" said Miguel Tinker Salas, a Pomona College history professor focusing on Venezuelan oil culture and society.\n\nBefore the discovery and expansion of the oil industry in the country, Venezuela was a poor and rural nation, and its economy was defined by agricultural exports, such as coffee and cacao, as reported by Mongabay. Wealth in Venezuela was predominantly held by large landowners, who formed a dominant elite.\n\nThe rapid growth of the oil industry provided the country's middle class, which was relatively small and concentrated in cities like Caracas, with an opportunity for professional expansion.\n\n\"They benefited tremendously from oil wealth and held managerial and professional positions,\" Tinker Salas told Business Insider. \"But they remained a small percentage of the population.\"\n\nHe estimates that less than 20% of the population was part of the middle class that emerged from oil growth.\n\n\"The hardware of modernity — the buildings, the architecture, the glitzy lights, and the planned development of cities — was made possible by oil,\" said Alejandro Velasco, an associate professor of Latin American history at New York University.\n\nAs oil wealth flowed into the country, urban consumer culture in Caracas and other major cities was heavily influenced by the United States. Among members of the middle and upper classes, shopping, fashion, and leisure increasingly reflected American tastes and lifestyles.\n\n\"For a particular segment of the population, they wanted to see themselves as an appendage of Miami-Dade County,\" Tinker Salas said. \"For another segment of the population, that dream was never possible.\"\n\n\"Those who had money,\" Tinker Salas said, \"could get on a plane in Caracas on a Friday afternoon, be in Miami in three hours, shop at Miami department stores, and come back on Sunday afternoon.\"\n\nCaracas also became an international hub for fashion and culture, attracting designers, models, and luxury brands from around the world.\n\nFrom 1976 to 1982, Air France operated a weekly Concorde flight between Caracas and Paris, a symbol of how closely Venezuela's elites aligned themselves with Europe during the oil boom.\n\nEconomic prosperity made luxury brands and high-end shopping popular in parts of Caracas, particularly for the country's wealthiest residents. But that consumer culture existed alongside stark economic inequality.\n\n\"You had fancy department stores and consumer culture existing side by side with deep inequality,\" Tinker Salas said.\n\nWhile the capital city remained the center of political and economic power, oil revenues also fueled development in other cities, shaping urban life across much of the country and giving more people access to \"electricity, medical services, and infrastructure that was often lacking in rural areas,\" Tinker Salas said.\n\nThroughout the century, as the agricultural industry lost its dominance of the domestic economy, the country saw increased internal migration to urban centers.\n\nThe city surrounding Lake Maracaibo, where oil was first discovered in the country, grew into Venezuela's second-largest city as oil production expanded.\n\nIts economy, identity, and growth were closely tied to oil, making the city a counterpart to Caracas during Venezuela's decades of rapid expansion.\n\nAs international companies grew their operations, Maracaibo welcomed many foreign oil workers.\n\nAs the oil industry expanded, Venezuela attracted foreign oil workers and immigrants, including Europeans during and after World War II. These arrivals helped shape the culture of the country's major cities.\n\n\"Oil exploration brought cultural influence, but Venezuela also became a destination for immigrants from Europe and across Latin America,\" Velasco said.\n\nNot every part of Venezuela was reshaped evenly during the expansion of the oil industry. As cities expanded, many rural areas continued to rely on agriculture, fishing, and local trade throughout the mid-century.\n\n\"On the surface, the country had a veneer of progress,\" Tinker Salas said. \"Venezuela had the highest standard of living in Latin America, but it also had the highest cost of living.\"\n\nWhile modern high-rises emerged in Caracas and other major cities, slums and informal settlements — or barrios — surrounding urban centers often told a different story from the luxurious, store-lined streets.\n\n\"The city was expanding and growing dramatically,\" Tinker Salas said, \"but alongside and in the shadow of those high-rise buildings were poor shacks where people lived in poverty.\"\n\nIn many neighborhoods, access to reliable water, sanitation, and other basic services remained limited even as other parts of the city modernized. Rapid urban growth during the oil era often outpaced infrastructure and long-term planning, leaving families to manage everyday shortages on their own.\n\nThe growth of informal neighborhoods surrounding major cities was a marker of internal migration patterns, where families from rural areas came to the city.\n\n\"Before the 1950s, barrios served as a kind of transitional space — people were in the city, but not fully of the city,\" Velasco said. \"There was a sense of gradual upward mobility: moving from the countryside into a barrio, then into a rented room, then eventually into a house or apartment.\"\n\n\"Even at the height of the so-called golden era, there was tremendous social, cultural, and economic disparity,\" Tinker Salas said.\n\nBetween the late 1940s and the 1950s, the dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez ruled Venezuela after rising to power during a period of political instability.\n\nHis military government utilized growing oil revenues to fund major infrastructure and modernization projects, even as political and civil freedoms were tightly restricted, reflecting a long-standing pattern of strongman rule that has shaped Venezuelan politics during the country's push toward democracy.\n\nUnder Pérez Jiménez, large public housing projects — or superblocks — were constructed in an effort to modernize the capital and reshape its working-class population. During this effort, informal settlements and barrios were razed, and their residents were forcibly relocated into high-rise complexes designed to reshape their way of life.\n\n\"People were suddenly expected to become modern residents in new spaces, and that transition was difficult,\" Velasco said.\n\nDaily life in the complexes was regulated by strict rules of conduct and state oversight. The model relied on the control of an authoritarian state, Velasco said, which ended as Venezuela moved toward democracy.\n\n\"The failure of that project produced a paradox where you have superblocks and barrios right next to each other,\" Velasco said.\n\nLinking the capital to the mountaintop Hotel Humbold, the Caracas Aerial Tramway symbolized how the state used large-scale public works to project progress, visibility, and national pride in an era that emphasized monumental infrastructure as proof of modernization.\n\nOpened in 1953 as part of a government effort to increase tourism, the Hotel Tamanaco was a key component of a broader initiative to present Venezuela as a modern, international destination.\n\nThe military dictatorship ended in early 1958, but the transition to democracy was marked by unrest, strikes, and internal divisions within the armed forces. In the months that followed, a new civilian-led government struggled to stabilize the country and respond to popular demands amid lingering uncertainty.\n\n\"The 1960s, when democracy began in Venezuela, are not a period of abundance,\" Velasco said. \"They're a period of crisis.\"\n\nDuring the early days of its democracy, Venezuela was widely perceived abroad — and promoted at home — as a stable democracy at a time when military rule was common in Latin America.\n\nHigh-profile diplomatic engagements, like the visit of US President John F. Kennedy, promoted the myth of Venezuela as an \"exceptional democracy,\" as Tinker Salas described it, even during a time when democratic regimes struggled internally.\n\n\"The myth of Venezuela as the exceptional democracy persisted because Venezuela provided the contrary example to what was happening in Cuba,\" Tinker Salas said.\n\nConstruction of the Guri Dam began in the early 1960s and continued in phases through the 1980s, reflecting a long-term effort to channel oil revenues into large-scale development projects.\n\nThe hydroelectric complex was part of a broader effort to diversify Venezuela's economy and modernize the country through investments in industry, energy, and infrastructure, extending beyond oil itself.\n\nIntroduced through US oil companies and foreign workers, baseball spread first through oil camps and industrial towns before taking root across the country.\n\nOver time, the sport moved beyond its foreign origins and became a shared cultural language, eventually emerging as one of Venezuela's most powerful symbols of national identity.\n\nAs television spread across Venezuela, variety shows and music programs introduced salsa, Caribbean rhythms, and popular performers into living rooms nationwide.\n\nLaunched in the early 1950s, the Miss Venezuela pageant grew alongside the spread of television and mass media, turning beauty competitions into nationally shared events.\n\nOver time, the pageant evolved into a symbol of national pride, representing how Venezuelans presented themselves to one another and to the world.\n\nDecades of rapid growth reshaped daily life in Venezuela, affecting everyone from rural migrants who moved into expanding cities to foreign immigrants who arrived as the country experienced unprecedented prosperity.\n\nFor those who remained in Venezuela — and for the millions who have since left — the past paints a complex picture of ambition, luxury, and inequality.",

Why? Because we already implement it,\" Mansour wrote.\n\nHe also said that Kalshi's insider trading rules are adapted from the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq.\n\n\"If you have material non-public information on a market, you cannot trade it and if you do, you are committing a financial crime,\" Mansour wrote. \"This applies to government employees, policymakers, executives, or anyone who holds information that is legally not meant to be public.\"\n\nIt all comes after a trader on Polymarket — a competing prediction market platform — made a well-timed trade on former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's future just hours before his capture, netting over $400,000.\n\nPolymarket, unlike Kalshi, does not explicitly forbid insider trading.\n\nMansour also said regulated prediction markets like Kalshi were being conflated with \"unregulated, offshore prediction markets,\" and that criticizing regulated markets for actions committed on the latter would only help the foreign markets.\n\n\"Prediction markets, like any industry, are not a monolith: there are important distinctions that matter,\" Mansour wrote.",

He has a color coding system for each pair he uses throughout the day. The green pair is for mornings, the yellow is for midday, and the pink takes him through the night, he told GQ.\n\nHe uses the AirPods for the 60 to 70 phone calls that Donaldson said he gets in a day, and, of course, for watching YouTube videos. They \"make it 10 times more fun,\" he said.\n\nHowever, his AirPods system isn't flawless. Some pairs have been victims of airplane seat cushions or have fallen out of pockets. Donaldson said he replaces his AirPods pretty often. A pair of AirPods Pro 3 retails for around $250 on the Apple website.\n\n\"I probably burned through at least a dozen pairs this year,\" Donaldson said.\n\nHis list of essentials also included a sleeping mask, a \"Dune\" board game, and a briefcase with $10,000, of which Donaldson said he has about 500 lying around his studio — for giveaways, of course.",

    "description": "Ina Garten's recipe for chicken pot pie soup was inspired by a dish she spotted at an airport. It's comforting, rich, and absolutely delicious.",
    "fullText": "Garten shares the origin story for chicken pot pie soup in her 2020 cookbook, \"Modern Comfort Food.\"\n\n\"This was a little crazy,\" she writes in the recipe's intro. \"I was walking through an airport once and spotted chicken pot pie soup on a restaurant menu. What a good idea!\"\n\n\"It was actually harder to make than it sounded — my first few attempts just tasted like chicken pot pie filling, not soup,\" she added. \"This one, though, hit all the right comforting notes, with good chicken stock, roasted chicken, and puff pastry croutons.\"\n\nTo make Garten's soup for a serving of six, you'll need:\n\nTo make 12 croutons for the chicken pot pie soup, you'll need:\n\nI preheated the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, then placed my three chicken breasts on a sheet pan with the skin side up.\n\nI rubbed the skin of each chicken with olive oil, then generously seasoned them with salt and pepper.\n\nGarten says to roast the chicken for 35 minutes, until the thermometer registers 130 to 140 degrees, then set it aside until the meat is cool enough to handle.\n\nI chopped the fennel, tarragon leaves, and carrots and minced my garlic.\n\nGarten says you should cut off the leeks' dark green leaves at a 45-degree angle. Then, chop the white and light green parts from each leek and wash them well in a bowl of water.\n\nShe notes that wet leeks will steam rather than sauté in the soup and recommends drying them in a salad spinner. If you don't have one at home, you can just pat them dry with a paper towel — it did the trick for me.\n\nI melted the butter over medium heat before throwing in the leeks, fennel, and carrots.\n\nI sautéed the veggies over medium-high heat for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Garten notes that the leeks should be tender but not browned.\n\nAfter sautéeing the carrots, leeks, and fennel, I added the garlic and tarragon and cooked everything together for an additional minute.\n\nGarten says you should be stirring the pot constantly during this step.\n\nWhile cooking, I didn't realize I was using dry sherry instead of cream sherry, which Garten specifies in her recipe. Truthfully, I haven't cooked with sherry much, and I just grabbed the first bottle I saw at the supermarket.\n\nBut the soup still tasted fantastic, so I wouldn't stress too much if dry sherry is all you have on hand.\n\nI seasoned the broth with 4 teaspoons of salt and 1 ½ teaspoons of pepper.\n\nMy friends immediately came into the kitchen to see what was on the stove.\n\nWhile the soup was simmering, I removed the meat from the chicken bones and diced it into 1-inch pieces.\n\nI first preheated the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and lined a sheet pan with parchment paper.\n\nThen, I lightly dusted my cutting board with flour and unfolded a sheet of puff pastry on the board. Make sure you've properly thawed your puff pastry beforehand. You can defrost it overnight in your refrigerator or let it sit on the counter for 45 minutes before you whip up the croutons.\n\nI dusted the puff pastry with flour and lightly rolled the sheet to smooth out any folds. You can use a rolling pin for this step, or just use your bottle of sherry!\n\nWhatever rolling tool you pick, just make sure to dust it with some flour so it doesn't stick.\n\nGarten recommends using star-shaped or fluted round cookie cutters, but next time, I might try dicing the puff pastry instead so I can have bite-sized croutons that are easier to eat with each spoonful.\n\nI had plenty of dough left over after I cut my 12 croutons, so I made extra — there's no need to waste good puff pastry!\n\nI seasoned each crouton with salt and pepper, then placed my pan in the oven for 10 minutes.\n\nEvery oven is different, so I recommend checking on them around the 8-minute mark. You'll know the croutons are ready when they're puffed and golden brown.\n\nI let the soup simmer, uncovered, for an additional five minutes.\n\nThis is also when I added the minced parsley.\n\nI'm truly thankful to whatever airport had chicken pot pie soup on its menu because Garten's recipe is the comfort meal of dreams.\n\nHer homemade chicken stock is so silky, delicious, and rich that I've already come to terms with the fact I'll never be able to use store-bought stock again.\n\nAll the veggies made each sip deliciously hearty and kept the spirit of pot pie alive, and I loved how much tender chicken I got with each spoonful.\n\nThe fluffy and buttery croutons were such a fun and indulgent addition, and they were even more delicious after soaking up all that broth.\n\nI've discovered a real love for making homemade soups, and this Barefoot Contessa recipe is definitely my favorite.\n\nWhile it takes some time and prep, Garten's chicken pot pie soup is worth the extra effort. It's hearty, comforting, and truly soothes every inch of the soul. It's perfect for a nice winter dinner or as a gift to a friend or family member who's under the weather.\n\nIt's the kind of soup that core memories are made from.",

    "fullText": "I've visited California wine country several times over the past couple of years, including many trips to the iconic Napa Valley.\n\nAnd although I definitely recommend a trip to Napa, there's another nearby wine region that I find myself returning to even more often: Sonoma.\n\nMore than just the city of Sonoma, the entire county feels like its own world. With rolling vineyards, rugged beaches, and redwood forests, it offers so much more than wine alone. Here's why this region stole my heart.\n\nThe region offers everything from relaxed, walk-in spots to high-end tasting rooms with incredible service and excellent wines.\n\nSonoma is also home to one of the oldest premium wineries in California, Buena Vista Winery. Here, I've enjoyed walking the historic grounds, seeing the old vines, and learning some history while I sip.\n\nBeyond great wine, Sonoma also offers unique tasting experiences. At the historic Bartholomew Estate Winery, for example, guests can enjoy a tasting after horseback riding through the vineyards.\n\nI had a similar adventure at Chalk Hill Winery in Healdsburg, where I paired my tasting with a Hummer ride throughout the estate.\n\nSonoma County is home to a diverse range of landscapes, including vineyards, redwood forests, rivers, and beaches.\n\nI love driving along the dramatic coastline and stopping to hike, or spending a few hours on the sand at Sonoma Coast State Park.\n\nIn a single day, I can sip wine, stroll under redwoods, and watch the sun set over the Pacific. In my experience, there aren't many other places where that's possible.\n\nSeveral smaller towns make up Sonoma County, and many of them feel like they were plucked straight from a Hallmark movie.\n\nI love walking and biking through Sonoma's quiet city streets, and grabbing coffee or fish tacos in Bodega Bay.\n\nI also enjoy celebrating the holidays on the festive square in Healdsburg, and wandering around Guerneville, tucked under the majestic redwoods.\n\nEach town has its own personality, and exploring them feels like moving through different little worlds, all connected by the same relaxed, welcoming energy that makes Sonoma so special.\n\nNapa is a popular travel destination, and with reservations recommended at many tasting rooms and restaurants, planning is key.\n\nIn Sonoma County, however, visitors don't always need to plan as far in advance, as many restaurants and wineries accept walk-ins.\n\nOn a recent trip, I visited Gracianna Winery, Overshine Wine Co., Korbel Winery, and Sonoma Coast Vineyards — none of which required a reservation. Each place offered a distinct experience and insight into the local wine scene.",

    "description": "Most startups measure success through top-line revenue growth. But beneath vanity metrics often lurks a hidden threat: sales debt. Like technical debt in software development, sales debt accumulates when companies prioritize short-term revenue over customer fit, creating financial drag, operational burdens, and strategic distractions that can undermine long-term success. In this article, we leverage our experience as sales leaders as well as a series of in-depth interviews to describe what sales debt is, how it impacts companies (for better and worse), and how leaders can address it.",

You can download mods that add completely new game modes or ways to play GTA 5, and there are also smaller mods that make a huge difference when you're on your fourth or eighth playthrough of the story mode.\n\nSo, whether you're experiencing GTA 5 for the first time or simply waiting it out for Grand Theft Auto 6's 2026 release date, there are some terrific mods to download in 2026. Of course, you'll have to play on PC to experience them, and some of the mods have compatibility issues with certain versions of the game. Make sure to check the description of each mod before downloading it to ensure you meet its requirements. It should also be noted that these mods are for the story mode only, as modding in GTA Online is explicitly against the rules of that mode.\n\nThese mods are in no particular order and mostly derive from the website GTA 5 Mods, as Nexus Mods only supports legacy mods for the game now. Legacy mods refer to mods that only work with versions of GTA 5 before the Enhanced Edition was released.\n\nWhile Los Santos is an absolutely iconic map with so much to see and do, it hasn't been changed too much in the 10+ years since GTA 5 was released. With the Map Editor mod, you have the freedom to completely alter how the map looks by adding your own premade objects. You can spawn in vehicles, NPCs, and even buildings. The mod allows you to freely fly around the map so you can easily place the objects where you want in a timely manner.\n\nOne of the more frustrating parts about the open world of Los Santos is that it technically isn't a completely open world. You can't enter hardly any of the buildings or other interiors that are scattered across the map, but that changes with the Enable All Interiors mod. Now, you can enter through any door to access previously unseen interiors. The mod also allows you to customize certain interiors if they're not particularly built out, including those in arcades, nightclubs, hangars, garages, and more locations.\n\nIf you've ever wondered what it would be like to be on the other side of the law in GTA 5, then the Chaos Response mod is what you're looking for. This mod allows you to become a police officer where crime and havoc are around every corner on the mean streets of Los Santos. Your experience with the mod won't consist of arresting law-breakers; instead, you'll simply try to control the chaos across three different game modes. The modes offered are Survival, Gang Activity, and Hold the Line. You're mostly alone for this mod, but you can call in six-star backup if things get too overwhelming.\n\nWhile several graphical overhauls have come to GTA 5 over the years, such as the latest Enhanced Edition, none of them quite hit the spot like the VisualV mod does. This mod drastically changes the graphics in Los Santos, adding new weather effects, fresh interior designs, better lighting, and improved colors across the board. Moreover, the weather effects and other visual changes are based on actual photos of real-life Los Angeles, adding to the mod's realism.\n\nThis mod is actually two additions rolled into one. The big change in the mod is the new 4K map that offers a stunningly detailed look at Los Santos from the view of a satellite. You can now see elevation on the map and a much more in-depth look at the roads, landscapes, and buildings that make up Los Santos. The mod also comes with the ability to zoom in on the map to get a better look at the detailed satellite view.\n\nThe Just Cause series was clearly inspired by Grand Theft Auto, but those games have taken things up to a whole different level when it comes to action. One of the most iconic parts about Just Cause is the parachute you can pull as you dive out of a vehicle. This mod brings that mechanic to GTA 5, allowing you to quickly bail from a car, pull a parachute, and then watch the car explode violently. The parachute you pull has infinite thrusters as well, meaning you can stay afloat forever and go whichever way your heart desires.\n\nAcquiring five stars in GTA 5 and surviving for any duration is a feat in and of itself, but what if the fun didn't have to stop there? The Army at SixStars mod allows you to attain a sixth star if you commit enough crimes in Los Santos. While the sixth star is difficult to get, you certainly get your money's worth out of it. When you get a sixth star, you'll start to see full-on armies surround you, complete with special vehicles, weapons, and new NPCs. The entire mod is customizable as well, so you can choose what you see at six stars.\n\nSometimes, you just need an easy way to restore your health in GTA 5. While this can come by way of sleeping or simply switching characters, the Openable Fridges mod offers a simple solution. The mod allows you to access fridges and eat the contents of them in both Michael's and Trevor's houses. The fridges are full of consumable items that you can eat to restore health when playing as either Michael or Trevor. To make the mod as detailed as possible, both fridges have different foods, with Trevor's fridge housing the type of food and drink items you expect him to have.\n\nGTA Online has been continually updated for over a decade, and during that time, thousands of unique vehicles have been added to the game. However, a majority of these vehicles have never seen the light of day in the story mode of GTA 5. Well, the online vehicles in singleplayer mod allow those vehicles to be driven on the offline roads of Los Santos. You can drive any vehicle in GTA Online in the story mode, and you'll even see NPCs driving these vehicles as well.\n\nLet's face it, GTA 5 has been out for years, and chances are, you've beaten the story mode at least once by now. If you have but still want to jump back in before GTA 6 arrives, then why not start as far ahead as possible? You can download the 100 Percent Save File mod to ensure your next trip in Los Santos includes millions of dollars and a plethora of weapons. Also, you won't have any missions to complete, so you can spend your time freely exploring the map and getting into all kinds of trouble.\n\nDiving under the water in the ocean surrounding Los Santos reveals a slew of aquatic life, but there's really nothing to interact with aside from the random shark that can gobble you up. Fortunately, the Fishing Mod gives you the chance to reel in some of the underwater creatures. You can purchase a fishing rod, approach any one of the 15 fishing locations, and press a button to start fishing. After some time, you'll get to reel in a unique fish and add it to your collection. There are 21 fish and 54 items to catch in the mod.\n\nThe story mode in GTA 5 does come with its fair share of robbery heists, but those need to be set up and planned. The ATM Robberies and Bank Heists mod allows you to rob an ATM or bank at any time to seriously increase your net worth and wanted level. There are 47 ATMs around the map to rob and 10 banks to hold up. Naturally, cops will immediately converge on your location during the robbery, and you need to lose them if you want to get away with all your stolen cash.\n\nTruly being a criminal means breaking into any home you want, stealing what the owners have, and maybe dealing with the occupants inside. GTA 5 doesn't allow you to enter a random house, but the Home Invasion mod gives you that ability. With the mod, you can carefully plan out how to rob a particular home, and then decide how the heist goes down once you're inside. Going in stealthy means you might be able to get away unscathed, but going in full force gives you free run of the house once the homeowners are out of the way.\n\nGTA 5's story mode is certainly not short of content, but you are able to add hours of additional missions with The Red House mod. It comes with over 20 new missions of all kinds, including heists, stealth missions, protection jobs, assassination contracts, and others. You can even spawn in some bodyguards that can help you through some missions if you're having a tough go at them solo. While the missions add hours of new content to GTA 5, they're also great ways to make some extra money.\n\nWhile the FIB and Los Santos police departments can cause some trouble for you, they're hardly difficult to lose when you have a fast enough vehicle. If you're looking for more challenging police encounters, download the Better Chases+ mod. This adds an entirely different element of police chases in GTA 5, starting with sending more cops and quickly escalating to a massive fleet of vehicles all hunting you down. However, even if you manage to elude the cops, you'll be issued an Arrest Warrant, which makes cops chase you all over again if they catch you or your vehicle on the street.\n\nThere are hundreds of vehicle mods to download for GTA 5, and while you can choose which ones you like, the Funny Vehicles mod comes with an assortment of classics to pick from. You'll be able to drive, and even fly, vehicles such as the DeLorean from Back to the Future, the Batmobile, Luke Skywalker's Landspeeder, and even a TIE Fighter from Star Wars, among plenty of others. Basically, if you want any kind of vehicle in GTA 5, the Funny Vehicles mod likely has it.\n\nFranklin is the car enthusiast out of the three main characters in GTA 5. However, the luxury mansion in the Vinewood Hills that you eventually acquire for Franklin severely lacks garage space for your cars. The Franklin Mega Garage mod solves that issue, transforming the back side of Franklin's hillside estate into something right out of Iron Man. The garage in the mod is a two-story glass enclosure that can house dozens of vehicles. The mod also makes several major alterations to Franklin's mansion as a whole, changing up the architecture, features, and amenities.\n\nFew mods on this list completely change the core foundation of GTA 5 like the No Water + Tsunami + Atlantis mod does. This mod has a few different capabilities, and they all involve water. One part of the mod allows you to completely remove all water from the map, making Los Santos look like something from The Maze Runner or Mad Max. Conversely, you can also make the map completely flooded with water so that the seas reach the tops of skyscrapers. By diving underneath, you're able to explore Los Santos as an underwater utopia. The mod can also add massive waves to the drowned city.\n\nBe honest with yourself, have you ever been driving through downtown Los Santos and thought, \"Wouldn't it be cool to swing from those skyscrapers like Spider-Man?\" Well, thankfully, there's a mod that allows you to become the red-suit Marvel hero. You can take possession of all of Spider-Man's abilities, including web-shooting, swinging from surfaces, web-pulling enemies, and taking advantage of the slow-motion Spider Sense.\n\nThe opening of GTA 5's story mode is set in a town called North Yankton, which you also briefly visit near the end of the game. However, beyond those two points, you never go back to North Yankton, and it's impossible to visit there otherwise. Of course, that's without the Travel to North Yankton mod. The mod allows you to freely visit the snowy town, giving you the chance to explore its streets, which are even populated with cars and NPCs. North Yankton comes with a bank you can enter and allows you to throw snowballs.\n\nSometimes, the GTA experience doesn't have to feature violence, weapons, or driving at top speeds through Los Santos. If you're looking for a more relaxing experience that simulates a game like American Truck Simulator, then you'll want to download the Trucking Missions mod. This mod has you riding all over the map in a big rig, hauling cargo to various NPCs. You can even design your own truck missions through the mod, so there's plenty of replayability and freedom.\n\nThe side activities are one of the best parts of the single-player mode in GTA 5. From playing tennis with Michael's wife to completing the wacky world missions for each character, there's always something to do in Los Santos. While the game also allows you to hit the links and play 18 holes of golf, this is quite limited, as you have to go to the course and follow a strict set of rules. For a little more freedom in how you golf, you can download the Golf Anywhere mod, which allows you to do exactly what it says: You can now play a hole of golf anywhere on the map, and there are even custom features to make the entire experience much quicker. For example, you can teleport to your ball so you're not chasing it down every time.\n\nDesigning a character's outfit for the day in GTA 5 is some players' favorite part of the game. However, you'll find that the default shoe options aren't the greatest, especially for Franklin. If you want to spice up Franklin's footwear, download the Ultimate Shoes Pack mod. This only works for Franklin and adds hundreds of unique shoes to your wardrobe. The mod creator claims that they have included every shoe ever made, so you'll have no shortage of choices when picking kicks for the day.\n\nIt seems like every game nowadays has some sort of zombies in it, so why not add some of the undead creatures to GTA? The Zombies mod, which is still in beta, adds the creatures of the night to the streets of Los Santos. The mod allows you to start \"games,\" which see you try to kill every zombie that now inhabits the city. You can accomplish this goal in any way you see fit, so don't hold back with the weaponry you use.\n\nIf you're a fan of battle royale games, then you'll enjoy the Complex Control mod. This mod gives you a nameless character to control, and your job is simple: survive against enemies while the map around you shrinks. Your character has access to plenty of weapons and even some powerful abilities, but the enemies you have to take down won't die easily. If you manage to survive until the map has completely shrunk, then you can gear up again and embark on a new challenge. This mod is single-player only, so there's no way for your friends to join you.\n\nThe Gang and Turf Mod aims to add a similar gang gameplay experience that's found in GTA San Andreas. The mod allows you to name your own gang, recruit members, and even establish a rival gang that you can then fight with over territory throughout Los Santos. As you control more turf with your gang, you gain more and more income. However, the rival gang won't ever stop coming after what's yours, so be prepared for constant conflict.\n\nHave you ever been driving around Los Santos and thought you recognized a landmark from the real city of Los Angeles? Well, instead of guessing whether the landmark is real or even in the spot you think, you can download the Real California Architecture mod. This mod makes it so every real landmark from L.A. is present in GTA V, which replaces a lot of the fake names and structures the developers used in their place.\n\nThe audio in GTA V is certainly iconic by this point, but let's face it, the gun sounds aren't anything special. Enter the Realistic Guns Sounds mod. This mod does exactly what it says it does; it replaces every gun sound in the game with new and improved audio that actually sounds like the gun you're firing. So when you fire an AR-15, you'll hear what you would normally hear in real life rather than the generic audio in the vanilla game.",

Animal Well is a metroidvania that also belies a puzzle box of secrets hiding in plain sight. Unfolding the mystery will take platforming and exploration as you'd expect, but also some sharp note-taking and observation skills. The deeper you go, the more mysteries and environmental puzzles there are to explore, for a truly engrossing experience unlike anything else.\n\nA gorgeous homage to Super Metroid, the Axiom Verge games merge gripping stories with incredible moment-to-moment gunplay. What makes the Axiom Verge approach feel so special is a truly staggering assortment of weapons, which range from your run-of-the-mill blasters to exotic guns that rip reality itself apart. Possibly the biggest draw of Axiom Verge is the atmosphere that it invites you to explore, as the alien nature of these levels coupled with the isolation that you'll have to endure is cold and unnerving.\n\nThese stages also house secrets that can distort its own design, breaking its own reality while dropping heavy theological questions into the mix that are coated with the nostalgic appeal of 8-bit graphics. If you're not in the mood to start pondering the very nature of existence though, the Axiom Verge games easily function as a brilliant fusion between Metroid and Contra that feel constantly rewarding when you dive head-first into them.\n\nRead our Axiom Verge review and Axiom Verge 2 review.\n\nRocksteady's Arkham series is renowned for setting a high-quality standard for superhero games. But while later entries would lean more heavily into the open-world aspect, Arkham Asylum is much more focused and tightly contained, centering on plumbing the depths of a single, dense environment. When a routine drop-off of the villainous Joker to Arkham takes an unexpected turn, Batman is trapped and surrounded by the supervillains he's locked up. The brooding game is a fight for survival mixed with a detective story as he explores the environment, unlocks new Bat-gear he's stashed away for emergencies, and even improvises with some of the villains' tools. The sequels were fantastic in their own right, but this original is a slick, modernized metroidvania.\n\nRead our Batman: Arkham Asylum review.\n\nBlade Chimera is a direct homage to one of the greats, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, due to its similarly styled (and gorgeous) pixel art and silver-haired protagonist. But the tightly designed metroidvania forges an identity of its own with a near-future setting that has you hunting down yokai-like demons. When a demon fuses itself to the protagonist, Shin, he has to both investigate deep mysteries about himself and his companion, while hiding the truth from hsi comrades. The dystopian future lets you use any combination of melee weapons and ranged firearms, and the story goes to some surprising places.\n\nNobody expects the Spanish Inquisition, especially in video games! Drawing a heap of inspiration from ye olde European Catholic imagery, Blasphemous creates a world to explore that is both horrifying and fascinating, while also providing great combat and a library of lore to sit through and read. Combat sequences are beautifully animated, themes of death and rebirth can be found everywhere, and the game is a brutal challenge that doesn't show any mercy to heretics. A metroidvania that throws some uncomfortable religious content your way, Blasphemous is an appealing prospect for anyone looking to venture out of their usual comfort zone in this genre.\n\nThe pitch for Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night was an appealing one when it first hit Kickstarter several years ago: a new series led by Castlevania: Symphony of the Night director Koji Igarashi, working to create a spiritual successor to the legendary Konami game for a new generation of platforms. Crowdfunded before you could even crack a whip, Bloodstained arrived a few years later and provided a gothic castle of familiar content. A few decades removed from its primary inspiration, Bloodstained's combat never fails to feel satisfying, there's a secret to uncover in every corner, and a smorgasbord of post-launch updates turned this game into a must-play entry in the metroidvania genre.\n\nRead our Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night review.\n\nConsidered by many to be a high-water mark for the Castlevania series following the Symphony of the Night template, Aria of Sorrow was the third and final Castlevania game on Game Boy Advance. While Circle of the Moon and Harmony of Dissonance both have their charms, Aria of Sorrow was refined to a mirror shine and became an instant classic. It featured intricate stage design and rock-solid combat, supported by a new Tactical Soul system that rewarded you for hunting down all the monsters in Dracula's keep. It also featured an original story in an unusual near-future setting, which capitalized on our fascination with Dracula's extended family. While original GBA carts could be hard to come by, Aria of Sorrow is available as part of the Castlevania Advance Collection, which sports quality-of-life features like save states and rewind, along with multiple regional versions.\n\nRead our Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow review.\n\nCrypt Custodian is the rare top-down metroidvania, which at times makes it almost resemble a classic Legend of Zelda game. As an adorable kitty-cat named Pluto who has recently died, you accidentally anger the wrong afterlife overseer and get sentenced to eternal janitor duty. The whimsical premise has you meet up with other ghosts, battle fiendish monsters, and discover new powers to explore the lush, hand-drawn landscape.\n\nA very different kind of metroidvania, Crystal Project often resembles an old-school Final Fantasy game more than a Metroid- or Castlevania-style side-scroller. But that trait also goes to show how flexible the genre can be. Crystal Project lets you explore a 2.5D world in your own way, finding crystals and unlocking classes to explore more of its voxelated map. While it's not what many would think of as a traditional metroidvania, the map unfurls as you find new abilities to take down tougher challenges.\n\nDead Cells may not be the first game that adopted a Dark Souls influence and drifted from metroidvania stylings into roguevania territory, but it's easily one of the best games of its genre. Raising the bar and creating a template for progression that other indie games would be inspired by in its wake, Dead Cells provides action that ranges from manageable to unrelenting the further you progress in the game, an expansive arsenal of weapons, numerous abilities, and a march forward through some of the most challenging bosses ever faced in the genre. You'll laugh, you'll cry--a lot--but that journey behind enemy lines is worth it for the bragging rights alone.\n\nAt first glance, Environmental Station Alpha might seem like your standard retro-style metroidvania set in a deserted space station. If you’re playing through for the first time, it can be completed without affecting that assumption. But Environmental Station Alpha is developed by Hempuli Oy--the same solo developer that released Baba Is You--and much like the latter title, it has plenty of hidden depth which really makes it shine, especially in the post-game.\n\nIts exceptionally clever environmental puzzles and huge world with lots of secrets clearly inspired modern titles such as Animal Well, and the soundtrack is fantastic. It has fun, varied boss fights which are reached via satisfying and solid platforming sections, and traversal and combat are both made more interesting by an early-game upgrade that we won’t spoil for you here. While ESA was originally released in 2015, it was rebuilt and re-released in 2024 with Steam Deck and more extensive Mac support, so you can now play it in more ways than ever before.\n\nYou control a cat in a robot suit. That's it, that is the primary appeal of Gato Roboto. Not enough for you? Well then, strap yourself in for a monochromatic ride through strange territory as you guide Kiki the cat through various obstacles and hazards. Gato Roboto does very little to stand out from the metroidvania pack in terms of innovation, but the game shines with just how well it approaches the format. It has tight controls, the minimalist art style is effortlessly charming, and it poses a proper challenge for even the most seasoned of Metroid hunters.\n\nThe Guacamelee games may have design elements that are evocative of Super Metroid, but you'd never think of this tag team of wrestling mayhem as clones of the Nintendo original. The digital DNA may be there as a foundation, but Guacamelee goes its own way with satisfying punch-'em-up action, dazzling level design, and top-rope platforming that go hand-in-hand with each other. The gameplay never feels less than polished, every element exists in harmony with other action-packed systems, and the energy on display is infectious.\n\nGuacamelee 2 is the stronger game in this duo with its more polished design, but the original is still an absolute treat to play even after its original debut so many years ago. Chalk this pair up as the best metroidvanias for wrestlemaniacs in your home.\n\nRead our Guacamelee review and our Guacamelee 2 review.\n\nAs challenging as it is hauntingly beautiful to look at with its crafted animations, Hollow Knight's tragic tale is one that you'll hungrily devour the deeper you descend into its world. The sharp gameplay and Dark Souls-inspired peril play second fiddle to the real charm of the game, which are the explorative elements that take the spotlight. The world around you is the result of thoughtful design and tantalizing clues as to the nature of what really happened, and the hunt to uncover the full picture makes an already terrific game that much more engrossing.\n\nA well-crafted metroidvania with a strangely cute little protagonist, Lone Fungus is a throwback to classic SNES-style platformers with a cute twist. You play as the eponymous lone fungus: the last mushroom on earth. With a massive map to explore and a customizable combat system, Lone Fungus is a good way to scratch your metroidvania itch with a classic flavor.\n\nA metroidvania-meets-monster-tamer in the vein of Pokemon, Monster Sanctuary has you explore the world while building up a wide stable of creatures to do your bidding. Like Pokemon, each monster has its own stats and abilities. But as a platformer, they also enable your exploration abilities, like allowing you to glide short distances or go underwater. It's an inventive combination that rethinks both metroidvanias and Pokemon-like games at the same time.\n\nThe first all-new 2D Metroid game since 2004's Zero Mission and a continuation of the story from Metroid Fusion, Dread was a pleasant surprise for Switch owners. The map is characteristically massive and full of secrets and opportunities for exploration, but Dread adds a light horror element with the addition of EMMI: a merciless machine that stalks you through parts of stages.\n\nWhen Metroid Prime premiered on the GameCube, it showed the world that Nintendo was still the master of innovating in the space. Years later, Metroid Prime Remastered on Nintendo Switch gave the classic a facelift and some quality-of-life tweaks, but mostly kept the excellent original intact. Set in the middle of the Metroid continuity, Metroid Prime sends Samus to Tallon IV in pursuit of Ridley. The translation of Metroid into a 3D series retained its quiet, moody exploration and storytelling told mostly through scanning the flora and fauna of the strange environment. Combat got a major advancement with lock-on targeting, letting you smoothly strafe around deadly space pirates and otherworldly creatures. Most surprising is that this all feels like a natural extension of the core of Metroid in a 3D space, which earned Retro Studios well-deserved plaudits.\n\nRead our Metroid Prime Remastered impressions.\n\nFeaturing a rich hand-drawn art style and Sekiro-inspired combat, Nine Sols is one of the most recent entries on this list, and one of the most acclaimed. The striking art style and smooth animation look gorgeous, but that wouldn't mean much if it didn't have the gameplay chops to back it up. Nine Sols delivers there as well, with tight and responsive combat that puts your skills to the test.\n\nBoth Ori games are jaw-dropping adventures that blend some of the best artistic design in the business with pinpoint precision, but Will of the Wisps is easily the superior sibling here. Both games feature a meaty core of exploration, combat, and using abilities to access previously-gated off areas, but Will of the Wisps is the game where those mechanics shine best and polishes them to create an action-packed experience that's smooth as silk.\n\nThey're the type of games that'll have you screaming in despair when you fail yet again to nail that one jump, cheering when you're get over a seemingly-impassable hurdle, and curling up into a ball of depression after you're left floored by the tear-jerking story haymakers that both games deliver. Superb examples of what the metroidvania genre is capable of, both games bring charm and heartbreak to the table with enjoyable platforming, hard-hitting action, and exquisite visuals.\n\nRead our Ori and the Blind Forest review and Ori and the Will of the Wisps review.\n\nPrince of Persia has long been a trailblazer, and the most recent release shows it can still innovate when exploring a new genre. The Lost Crown is a 2D, exploration-based take, and it's a masterful example of the form. The combat is tense and exciting in a way that many metroidvania games struggle to be, but that doesn't come at the cost of its exploration bona fides. In fact, The Lost Crown innovates with smart ideas like Memory Shards to help mark your place for further exploration as you gain more powers, and a Guided option to subtly point you in the right direction. You can expect to see lots of other metroidvania games in the future copying some of these ideas.\n\nRead our Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review.\n\nA pair of excellent metroidvanias with a heavy emphasis on exploration in a handcrafted world, SteamWorld Dig and its sequel are charming and compact-sized games that mix deconstruction of the world around you with some thrilling combat. While the first SteamWorld Dig is a quirky adventure with some wonderful locales, the sequel is a vastly superior follow-up that offers more satisfyingly destructible environments, a better selection of tools to dig your way through to new challenges, and a more polished gameplay loop that rewards you for your progress. It's more focused, cuts plenty of fat off of the original game's foundation, and the journey to the center of a hostile planet is full of surprises along the way.\n\nRead our Steamworld Dig review and our SteamWorld Dig 2 review.\n\nYoku's Island Express is an odd coupling of genres, a concept on paper that shouldn't work and yet it's an extraordinary experience that successfully fuses metroidvania elements with pinball. All the usual exploratory features from a metroidvania are present, but getting around levels and various hazards requires guiding your little bug-man and his precious egg around a world of organic bumpers and flippers that'll send the resilient hero careening all over the screen. There's a definitive path through each stage that's fun and adorable, combat is largely swept to the side in favor of exploration, and the whole experience is both easy to grasp and rewarding for any pinball wizards who have a firm grasp on the mechanics of the classic arcade genre.\n\nRead our Yoku's Island Express review.\n\nThe almost unknown but fantastic cult hit Xanthiom Zero goes back to the origins of the genre by modeling itself after the original Metroid. The 8-bit-style graphics have a simplistic elegance, even as the game takes advantage of modern technology by shaping and sizing the corridors of Planet 4-514 to fit whatever is needed from them. As always, you'll uncover items that will help unlock new paths, but Xanthiom Zero sets itself apart by offering dozens of items to find, rather than a handful. Similarly, your weapons can be combined to create more than 5,000 permutations. All of that helps this game defy its retro appearance to feel utterly modern.\n\nOwlboy is a pixelated Metroidvania that utilizes a different style of combat than you might be used to. Instead of using traversal or traditional weapons as a means to fight enemies, you use Owlboy's companions, which he carries around from level to level. As you progress to different levels, you'll encounter several enemy types that require different strategies and equipment to defeat. Of course, there are also still plenty of puzzles to solve and loot to find as you thoroughly search every area you come across.\n\nOwlboy is a more relaxing and laid-back Metroidvania, but it can be enjoyed by any fan of the genre.\n\nThe Momodora franchise is quite well-known within the Metroidvania community, and Moonlit Farewell is arguably the best game the series has to offer. The game sees you take control of Momo, a priestess who is traveling alone through demon-infested lands to sanctify the surroundings. Moonlit Farewell won't take you too long to beat, but there are boss fights, challenging enemy encounters, different puzzles, and gorgeous levels to explore. Combat is definitely a highlight, as Momo can utilize a flurry of attacks and combos in addition to several movement mechanics that help her stay alive.\n\nMoonlit Farewell offers its rewarding combat system with multiple play styles as well as an in-depth world to explore, full of unique environments, enemies, and lore to uncover.\n\nEnder Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist is a fantasy, side-scrolling Metroidvania that also features elements of action-adventure games and RPGs. The graphics are 2D, but the levels in the game offer a plethora of vibrancy and different post-apocalyptic environments that capture and hold your attention. As for gameplay, Bloom in the Mist has you play as a character named Lilac, who needs to use her power to save an entire race of people. As you progress through the game, you'll need to navigate through different levels using movement mechanics as well as battle enemies using Lilac's inherent and evolving powers. You can collect new gear, upgrade Lilac's abilities, and meet companions with varying skillsets along the way as well.\n\nIf you're searching for a Metroidvania with RPG elements and challenging combat, then look no further than Mandragora: Whispers of the Witch. Set in a fantasy world ruled by darkness, Mandragora: Whispers of the Witch features beautiful 3D graphics, side-scrolling gameplay, and Souls-like combat. At the start of the game, you can pick between six classes that all offer unique abilities and gear. You can also create your character, something not often found in Metroidvanias. From there, you'll embark on a journey across an interconnected world, battling monsters, upgrading your character, and speaking to NPCs all in an effort to determine the fate of your world.",

That's alright, though--that's where we come in.\nKeep in mind that, since you won't need to extract with any items to complete any steps in What We Left Behind, you can comfortably head in with a free loadout to avoid risking any of your good loot.

    "fullText": "There are many good reasons to get a VPN (Virtual Private Network) app installed on your phone or laptop: They make it harder for anyone else to track your browsing, they keep your data safe when you're on public wifi networks, and they even let you spoof your location so you can access geolocation-locked content.\n\nYou'll also find plenty of choice when it comes to VPNs. Our own guides to the best paid VPNs and the best free VPNs show the wealth of impressive apps out there, and even when you narrow down the criteria, you've still got lots of options to pick from—see our recommendations for the best free VPNs for Android.\n\nSo what exactly should you be looking for when it comes to choosing the right VPN for you? These are the features and selling points that you'll see mentioned when you're browsing VPN comparisons, and what they mean (and once you've built up a shortlist from these criteria, then you can look at the prices and extras).\n\nOne of the downsides of loading up a VPN is that your browsing speed can suffer, while your data gets pinged around multiple servers across the globe. Ideally, you want all the protection that a VPN offers, without too much of a hit on download and upload rates (no matter how many other people are using the same VPN).\n\nUnfortunately, this isn't really something you can gauge just by looking at VPN listings and ads, as most VPNs will claim to be the fastest. Either read benchmark tests put together by publications and authors you trust (watch out for sponsored content), or make use of as many free trials as you can and do some testing yourself.\n\nYour VPN of choice needs to reroute your internet traffic somewhere, and how many servers a particular VPN has around the world can make a substantial difference to speed and availability. It's also going to determine where in the world you can pretend to be of course, if you want to jump to another country virtually.\n\nBroadly speaking, the more servers the better, though as with VPN speeds you may have to do some testing of your own to check reliability and transfer rates. Look for server locations close to you (for speed), and outside of heavily censored or surveilled countries (for privacy), and check any technical specs that are given for them.\n\nSomething else to look out for is split tunneling, or the ability to send only some of your internet traffic through a VPN. This means you get better speeds (and less security and privacy) on data that's not so important, if you're just reading the news or learning a language. It's a feature that many of the best VPNs now offer.\n\nAnother feature worth checking for is a kill switch. It sounds rather dramatic, but it's simply a feature that shuts down your internet connection if the data encryption somehow fails—cutting you off from the internet, but preventing your connection and data from being exposed. Again, this is now fairly common, but not every VPN offers it.\n\nYou should only consider VPNs that have clear no-logs policies (no browsing data is permanently retained) or zero-logs policies (supposedly even stricter, covering more data). Don't take the VPN's word for it. though: Look for third-party audits from independent security companies, carried out regularly, to verify these claims.\n\nIf these logs are retained, they might be sold to data brokers, or pulled by law enforcement agencies—so check the individual privacy policies for details of what happens when you're connected to your VPN. Some VPNs go above and beyond when it comes to letting you stay anonymous: Mullvad VPN lets you pay by cash through the post, for example.\n\nA VPN protocol is the way that the VPN connects to the internet at large: It makes a major difference to speed and security, and you'll often see it mentioned in VPN listings. However, as important as it is, it's not something that's easy to compare across different VPN services—most VPNs will simply say their protocol of choice is the best.\n\nOnce you've got a shortlist of VPNs together, do some background reading on the protocols they use: Look for independent assessments of their security and transparency, technical benchmarks, and protocols that have been open sourced so they can be analyzed. OpenVPN and WireGuard are two well-regarded protocols, for example.\n\nVPN companies are bound by the laws and regulations of the country that they're based in—so it's a good idea to look for ones based in places where surveillance regulation and government monitoring is less strict. If necessary, check the VPN's policies on how it deals with data requests from the authorities and law enforcement in its local region.\n\nIt's also worth weighinga VPN company's reputation: How does it make money? What other services does it offer? What's its record with data breaches? This is much more important with a VPN than it is with your streaming music provider, for example, because you're trusting it with all of your online data while you're connected.\n\nGenerally speaking, it's worth paying for a VPN, as you're giving it so much responsibility in terms of your online access and security. The paid options are almost always going to give you a faster and more reliable service, and if you regularly make use of a VPN then the monthly fee is well worth the investment.\n\nIt is, however, worth looking for services that offer free trials and your money back if you're not satisfied (usually after 30 days). Not only does it reflect well on the VPN company, it means you can see if the VPN suits your needs—and check how fast its servers are—before signing up for any kind of payment plan.",

    "fullText": "It's CES week, when the tech world gathers in Las Vegas to check out the latest gadgets, prototypes, and innovations that will shape the future. Lifehacker's tech team is on the ground at the convention, tracking down big stories and cool gear.\n\nBilling itself as \"The Most Powerful Tech Event in the World,\" CES (short for \"Consumer Electronics Show\") is the Consumer Technology Association's trade convention. It began in 1967 as a small showcase for televisions and radios, but over the decades CES has become a gathering of the tribes for tech culture. Everyone is there, from huge companies like Samsung and Sony, to scores of journalists, to scrappy startups with big dreams. From innovative AI tools to electric vehicles, laptops, e-readers, and robotic dogs, CES is where tech companies show off their wares, journalists dig up the next big story, and tech insiders network and sneak a look into the future.\n\nCES is held in Las Vegas from Jan. 6-9. The Las Vegas Convention Center hosts the main show floor, but there are CES-related events at the Fontainebleau Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay, The Sphere, and other locations across Las Vegas.\n\nMost major electronics and technology companies are attending CES 2026 in some form. Here are some of the most vital exhibitors:\n\nSamsung Electronics: Samsung's theme this year is \"Your Companion to AI Living,\" and the focus is how artificial intelligence can enhance people's day-to-day lives.\n\nLG Electronics: Describing it as \"innovation in tune with you\" and \"affectionate intelligence,\" LG is showing off its take on AI designed to power robots, appliances, vehicles and TVs.\n\nSony: Sony's main focus this year is mobility. It's unveiling the Sony Honda Mobility (SHM) and showcasing the AFEELA electric vehicle Prototype.\n\nTCL: It's not CES without new TVs, and TCL is showing off a gigantic set with a SQD-Mini LED display.\n\nPanasonic: Under the banner \"The future we make,\" Panasonic promises it is \"leveraging the power of AI to amplify the impact of our human-centric technologies, services and solutions.\"\n\nNVIDIA: The chip-maker is showcasing its new Vera Rubin AI supercomputer platform, the Alpamayo reasoning model for self-driving vehicles, and more.\n\nAMD: AMD is unveiling the Ryzen AI processors for PCs and the Ryzen 7 9850X3D for gaming.\n\nIntel: Intel launched its new Intel Core Ultra Series 3 processors, codenamed \"Panther Lake.\"\n\nUber: Transportation firm Uber wants you to know about its new robotaxi.\n\nThe LEGO Group: Lovable toy makers LEGO announced \"Smart Bricks,\" packed with a tiny processor that \"brings play to life.\"\n\nIkea: Making its first appearance at CES, Swedish furniture retailer Ikea unveiled 21 new smart home products.\n\nIn fact, so many brands exhibit at CES, it's more notable which ones aren't there. This year's list of no-shows includes Apple (which never really does CES), iRobot, and Tesla. Big brands with a more limited presence include Microsoft and Amazon.\n\nAlong with the expected innovations in televisions and laptops, CES 2026 is crammed with artificial intelligence, robots, and mobility devices, and health-focused wearables. Here are some of the biggest announcements at CES 2026 so far.\n\nAt its keynote, NVIDIA unveiled Alpamayo, \"the world's first thinking, reasoning autonomous vehicle AI.\" This could be serious competition for Tesla.\n\nHP showed off a new mini desktop computer, The Eliteboard G1a. You just plug the keyboard into any monitor and go to town. Only time will tell if this is a gimmick or a new form factor.\n\nHyundai and Boston Dynamics showed off humanoid robot Atlas. But Hyundai didn't show off any new electric vehicles, suggesting a cautious outlook for the near future.\n\nBroadcom showed off Wi-Fi 8 routers and chips, providing a practical look into the future.\n\nBelow is a guide to some of the major events at CES 2026.\n\nSunday, January 4: Media Day 1 at Mandalay Bay\n\nMonday, January 5: Media Day 2 at Mandalay Bay. C-Space: 9 AM - 5 PM\n\nTuesday, January 6: Show Floor Press Conferences, Exhibits: 10 AM-6 PM, C-Space: 9 AM - 5 PM\n\nWednesday, January 7: Show Floor Press Conferences, Exhibits: 9 AM-6 PM, C-Space: 9 AM - 5 PM\n\nThursday, January 8: Exhibits: 9 AM-6 PM, C-Space: 9 AM - 5 PM\n\nFriday, January 9: Exhibits: 9 AM-4 PM\n\nCES Unveiled Las Vegas – The Official Media Event of CES 2026 with innovative product previews – 4:00-7:00 PM\n\nAMD Chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su, 6:30 PM, The Venetian\n\nSiemens President and CEO Dr. Roland Busch, 8:30 AM, The Venetian\n\nLenovo Chairman and CEO Yuanqing Yang, 5:00 PM, Sphere\n\nCaterpillar CEO Joe Creed, 9:00 AM, The Venetian\n\nCES is a trade-only event, so it's not open to the general public, but if you're affiliated with the tech industry in some way, you can register at CES's official site.

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Garmin Watch User Should Know",
    "description": "A lot of the best features are buried deep in menus—here's what's worth digging for.",
    "fullText": "Garmin fitness watches are such powerful tools that you can use one for months or years without discovering some of their best hidden features. Here are 10 hacks that every Garmin user should know, from the setup steps you may have skipped, to lesser-known features you’ll wish you knew about earlier.\n\nThese hacks apply to watches like the Garmin Forerunner line (like the 570 and 265, to name two of my favorites). Other Garmin models may vary, but most of the features I describe below will still apply. The Vivoactive 6, for example, doesn’t have as many buttons as the Forerunners, but you can still set up shortcuts for the two buttons it has.\n\nSave yourself time digging through menus (or waiting for features to trigger on their own). By going to the settings menu and selecting System and then Shortcuts (previously “Hot Keys”), you can assign features to long presses or combination button presses. For example, on my watch I hold the DOWN button to bring up music controls, and the BACK button to turn the touchscreen on or off. You can also assign shortcuts to bring up the weather or the stopwatch, to save your current location, to turn on a “night shift” mode, and more.\n\nGarmins come with a few stock watch faces, but you can find more on the ConnectIQ store. I’m partial to the Big Easy watch face, with its simple text and configurable data. (I have mine set to display sunset time and weekly running mileage, among others.) Other popular faces include Segment 34, Quatro, and this Fenix 8 lookalike that you can install on just about any Garmin watch.\n\nWhen you start an activity, you’ll see a few “favorite” activities to choose from—running and cycling, for example. If you’re always scrolling past activities you don’t do and digging for the ones you actually want, just take a minute to configure this list. I always delete outdoor cycling (not a thing I do), but I make sure that strength and trail running are near the top, since I do those often.\n\nTo remove an activity from the favorites list, long press it (or long press the left middle button). You can also reorder the item in the list this way. To add a new activity, scroll to the end of the list and select “add.”\n\nYou can also customize the “glances” you see when you scroll down (or swipe up) from the watch face. If you don’t want to see your running performance or your calorie burn, you can remove them from the list. If you want the phase of the moon right up front, that’s within your power as well. Long press a glance to remove or reorder, and scroll to the bottom to add new ones.\n\nThe controls menu works the same way. This is the circular dial of apps you get by long pressing the top left button on a Forerunner. Long press an app, or long press the left middle button, to edit this list. The wallet, calculator, stopwatch, and modes like Battery Saver are nice to have here.\n\nIf you’re running with a buddy, you can both load the same workout or route on your watch. Just go to the end of your activity list and select Garmin Share. While you’re on this screen, you can receive shared files or scroll down to select a file that you’d like to send.\n\nI have a handy library of workouts and routes on my watch (more on why below) and I find myself sharing them often. If my husband wants to do a interval workout, I can beam him one of my favorites. You don’t need your phone to do this—it’s a watch-to-watch function you can do in a few seconds before starting your run.\n\nI do a lot of solo runs, so I like to set up LiveTrack. When LiveTrack is on, my watch shares GPS data with my phone, and my phone sends that data to a private Garmin web page and shares the link with my trusted contacts. This way, my husband can see whether I’m almost done with my run (without bothering me), and if I were to get injured or need to be picked up, he’d be able to see exactly where I am.\n\nLiveTrack does require that you run with your phone (I do anyway), and that your phone has service where you’re running. In the Garmin Connect app, you select More, then Safety & Tracking, and then LiveTrack. I like to turn on AutoStart so I don’t have to remember to start LiveTrack every time.\n\nI hate getting phone notifications on my watch, but for some people, notifications are the main reason for having a watch. And whatever preference you have for daily wear, you may feel differently during workouts. Maybe you want notifications during workouts so you don’t have to check your phone constantly, or maybe your workout time is when you don’t want to be disturbed.\n\nFortunately this is easy to configure. Go to settings, and then Notifications & Alerts for all your notification preferences. The in-activity settings aren’t here, though: you have to go to Focus modes, and then choose Activity, and set up the ways you’d like your watch to behave during activities. The Smart notifications setting lets you change whether notifications come through at all and whether they vibrate or make sound. You can change other activity settings here as well, like screen brightness.\n\nYou can create workouts within the Garmin Connect app, which is a little confusing at first, but very much worth learning. Once you get the hang of it, it only takes a few minutes to program a Norwegian 4x4 to work on your VO2max, or set up whatever new fartlek workout you just dreamed up this morning.\n\nTo get started, hit \n\nI especially like to create Garmin workouts for timed strength training workouts, like EMOM (“every minute on the minute”) structures. I also love it for rest timing in traditional strength training workouts: if I tell my watch I’m resting three minutes between sets of squats, it will beep and start the set when time is up.\n\nIf you want to follow a training plan from your Garmin device, you’ll probably set up one of the built-in plans. That’s a natural thing to do, but you have more options. You can set up a third-party app like Runna to give you a training plan and sync its workouts to your Garmin calendar. You can also program workouts in yourself.\n\nLet’s use the 4x4 I mentioned above as an example. This is an interval run I might want to do once or twice a week. After creating the workout, I can view it and tap the three-dot menu and then Add to Calendar. If I assign it to tomorrow, then when I start a run tomorrow, the watch will ask if I’d like to do the 4x4, since that’s the workout of the day. Even without a formal training plan, I find this feature handy to plan out my upcoming week.\n\nGarmin’s strength training features can be useful, but it’s not a great app for tracking your progress over time or setting up training programs with details like sets, reps, and weight. LiftTrack is a third-party app that provides a lot of the features Garmin is missing. If you want to track strength training on your phone, do yourself a favor and set this up rather than only using the Garmin app.\n\nSome Garmin watches (the more expensive ones) have full-color maps built in, but even the more barebones models still have the ability to follow a route and navigate you back home. This is a more useful feature than you might think, especially if you enjoy running trails or want to plan out specific distances.\n\nTo start, you’ll need a GPX file. You can make one in Garmin Connect by going to Training & Planning, then Courses, and Create Course. Tap points on a map, and the app will tell you how many miles are in the route you’ve drawn, and how hilly it is.\n\nYou can also download GPX files from other apps like Strava or RunGo, or have a training partner send you one—either through Garmin Share, or have them send it via another method, like text, to your phone (just open the file in the Garmin Connect app, and sync to your watch from there).\n\nThis way, you’ll be able to follow the route from your watch. It will tell you how many miles are left, and you can swipe to the elevation profile to see if you have a big hill coming up. Your watch can remind you when you have a turn coming up, and you’ll be able to see if you’ve gotten off course. With or without maps, this set of features is incredibly useful for navigating trails or new-to-you running routes.",

    "title": "CES 2026: I Made Fun of My Daughter, but This Rideable Luggage Made Me a Believer",
    "description": "When my daughter showed me videos of rideable luggage, I was cynical. Then I actually tried it out.",
    "fullText": "Like many parents, sometimes I view my kids as lazy. This was one of those times: At Orlando International Airport, on our way to Disney World, my 16-year-old daughter shared how much she wanted a rideable suitcase. I laughed and told her that she can walk just fine. \"Besides,\" I added, \"that would never work.\"\n\nI hadn't seen rideable luggage yet, and I pointed out the immediate detractions that came to mind. First, it wouldn't work for someone like me—6'3 and 215 pounds. Second, I had doubts that it would have much storage space to carry items, which is the whole point of luggage. And third, who would be caught dead riding something so silly? But my daughter was determined to prove to me not only that they exist, but that they're popular. She showed me videos of them in action. I wasn't convinced.\n\nWe joked about rideable luggage as we walked through the airport. It came up again as we trekked through Disney World. (\"See, if we had rideable luggage, we wouldn't be so tired.\") By the time we walked to baggage claim after returning to LaGuardia, it was a running gag. That same week, as I prepared for CES, I looked into rideable suitcases and made plans to test them out at the show. And as it turns out, my daughter was right.\n\nAt CES, I tried several rideable suitcases, putting my bulky 6'3, 215-pound frame on motorized, battery-powered, airplane cabin-sized bags. The best I rode came from Jitlife, which is premiering its fourth model, the Jitlife JS07i, this year. Not only did it impress, but it's also one of the finalists for the official Best of CES 2026 awards for the travel category.\n\nLike all the suitcases I drove, the Jitlife rideable suitcase is the size of a standard cabin bag but can carry up to 250 pounds, has a maximum speed of around 8 miles per hour, and can travel about six miles on a charge. The suitcase has a capacity of 28 liters, which is indeed much less than the 60-80 liters of space I expect from a standard check-in bag, but it's better than I thought for something that weighs under 20 pounds and can carry me around. Overall, the kid was right: Rideable luggage can work, and it's actually already a fairly common sight in Asia, particularly in China.\n\nAs for looking goofy riding one, well, I believe my point stands. But, for those with accessibility needs, younger children, or people who prioritize its functionality over the judgment of strangers, rideable luggage might be a worthwhile solution for moving through large airports more quickly and easily. Testing it out is certainly the most fun I've had at CES, so whatever the future of rideable luggage, I'll live with the \"I told you so\" from my kid.",

    "title": "CES 2026: This Accessory Can Turn Your MacBook’s Display Into a Touchscreen",
    "description": "The Intricuit Magic Screen is going on Kickstarter soon, the company says.",
    "fullText": "Plenty of people have been asking for a MacBook with a touchscreen display, and now that is possible with the Intricuit Magic Screen, according to an announcement at CES 2026. It's a snap-on accessory that attaches to your MacBook's display, and uses one of the USB-C ports on the laptop for power. Once connected, you can touch the Magic Screen and your input will be registered on the Mac.\n\nThe good news is that this product ships with a stylus, which will make it a lot easier to interact with different Mac apps. When you tap something on your iPhone or iPad, the UI takes into account the fact that your fingers are a lot thicker than a mouse pointer. On the Mac, the default input is the mouse cursor, so the Magic Screen's stylus is better suited to those interactions than using your fingers. Having said that, you can use your fingers with this touchscreen accessory too.\n\nKeep in mind that using a snap-on touchscreen accessory has a few caveats. The first is that you can't quickly close your MacBook's lid when the Magic Screen is attached. The company has added a thick piece of plastic to the base of the accessory. This part rests just above your MacBook's keyboard and it'll stop you from accidentally closing your laptop's lid with the Magic Screen attached. This ensures that you won't accidentally damage your laptop'd display by slamming the lid shut when the accessory is attached.\n\nIt also means that you'll always have to unplug the Magic Screen when you're not using the Mac, which can be a bit annoying. Intricuit says it also works in pen tablet mode, so you can place the Magic Screen on your desk and use your stylus to draw something or to control the Mac. This accessory's battery will last up to 100 hours on a single charge, the company claims.\n\nIntricuit announced this product at CES 2026 and said the Magic Screen will be on Kickstarter soon at a launch price of $139. The company says it expects to start shipping the product in the first quarter of 2026. It currently supports the 16-inch M-series MacBook Pro, 14-inch M-series MacBook Pro, 15-inch M-series MacBook Air, and 13-inch M-series MacBook Air models. You'll just need to choose the correct variant for your laptop while placing the order.",

    "fullText": "Hearts' main headline grabbers in their ascent to the top of the Scottish Premiership have tended to be forwards, but in defender Stuart Findlay, the Tynecastle side have had an equally valuable asset.\n\nNo stranger to Scottish football, the former Kilmarnock player returned north from Oxford United on loan in the summer and on Wednesday agreed a deal to sign permanently in the summer on a contract until 2028.\n\nFindlay, ever present in the league this term, has contributed five goals so far this season. It was his header that set Hearts on their way to victory over Rangers last month and his late double that secured an early season win at Dundee United.\n\nThe 30-year-old has also helped Derek McInnes' record 12 clean sheets and has made more clearances (136) than Celtic counterpart Liam Scales (106) and John Souttar of Rangers (90).\n\nAs far as stats go, his numbers are favourable. He, like all Hearts' signings, went through Jamestown Analytics' assessment and passed the test.\n\n\"If he had rated poorly, we wouldn't have signed him. It just wouldn't have got over the line,\" McInnes said of Findlay on Open Goal, external in October.\n\n\"He's a brilliant boy in terms of being a brilliant team-mate. He allows you to play with that high line, gives you that left-sided balance.\"",

If I go into the detail, I was in a ruck. I was illegal and trying to rip the ball off someone on the ground. Classic out-half thing.\n\n\"I went for the rip and found myself on my back.

Newcastle's priorities are now elsewhere after they failed with a £55m bid in the summer and signed Nick Woltemade.\n\nSean Dyche's Forest are seven points clear of the relegation zone - and 15 above Wolves - after Tuesday's 2-1 win at West Ham.\n\nArnaud Kalimuendo, Forest's summer signing from Rennes, is poised to join Frankfurt on loan with an option to buy, leaving Igor Jesus and Taiwo Awoniyi as the club's only strikers.\n\nStrand Larsen has been targeted by unhappy Wolves fans this season, having scored just one Premier League goal.\n\nIt is part of the reason why Wolves are willing to allow the Norway international to leave, even though he only made his initial loan move from Celta Vigo permanent last July for £23m.\n\nYet, Strand Larsen is well-respected behind the scenes, where he is seen as a leader. He earned internal credit for the professional way he handled Newcastle's interest and bids.\n\nHe was rewarded with a five-year contract in September after a promising debut season, scoring 14 goals and helping Wolves finish 16th.\n\nWolves' likely relegation is a factor in Strand Larsen's future - they only secured their first Premier League win of the season last Saturday, at the 20th attempt, as they beat West Ham 3-0.\n\nStrand Larsen would not be expected to remain at Molineux in the Championship and selling him in January would generate a higher fee than the summer.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter 14 months in charge, Ruben Amorim was dismissed by Manchester United on January 5.\n\nWhile the club recovers from a rocky spell under Amorim's leadership, the Red Devils must press on with the Premier League season, beginning with Burnley away.\n\nThe midweek league game at Turf Moor is followed by an FA Cup third-round matchup with fellow top flight side Brighton & Hove Albion at Old Trafford on the weekend. These two matches will see a makeshift coaching group take charge of the team.\n\nThe Sporting News explains how United will press on in the short term as the 20-time English champions rebuild their managerial structure.\n\nMORE:Why was Ruben Amorim sacked? | Amorim's explosive Leeds rant | Cost of Amorim's exit\n\nFormer Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher will take charge for the match against Burnley on Wednesday, January 7.\n\nThe 41-year-old is likely to remain in charge as caretaker manager until an interim boss is assigned for the remainder of the season.\n\nIt's expected that United will not make a permanent hire until the 2025/26 season is completed, unless something unforeseen progresses before that time.\n\nFletcher's former teammate Jonny Evans has been earmarked to return to the coaching staff to assist this week.\n\nBorn in Scotland, Fletcher made 342 appearances for Manchester United during his decorated playing days, winning five Premier League titles and one Champions League crown in a 20-year career under Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\nAfter subsequent stints at West Brom and Stoke City, plus career 80 international caps for Scotland, Fletcher retired in 2019 and transitioned to coaching.\n\nHe returned to United's youth setup in October 2020, hired as the Under-16 coach. He was promoted to the first-team coaching staff in January 2021, concurrently serving as technical director until he was replaced in that role by Jason Wilcox in April 2024.\n\nFletcher made the move back to the youth setup as U-18 coach in July 2025, where he has been until being named caretaker in the wake of Amorim's departure.\n\nWhile Fletcher is a candidate to be named permanent manager of United, a lot would have to happen for that to come to pass.\n\nHe would first have to impress as caretaker enough to earn the interim job for the rest of the season to consider him a true permanent option. Should he do that, then consideration about a long-term position could be brought forth.\n\nEven then, hiring an individual with no senior managerial experience would be an enormous risk, one that United likely would be averse to after the disaster of Amorim's tenure.",

    "fullText": "Two athletes are being recognized for their outstanding achievements on the court.\n\nThis week, both a Redding Christian and an Enterprise high school athlete are being highlighted. It's time to meet the two Shasta Family YMCA Athletes of the Week for their accomplishments over the week of Dec. 29 to Jan. 4.\n\nTeam Contributions: Lions star athlete Collin Matos was a two-way standout on Redding Christian's state championship-winning football team in 2025, and he's continued his athletic success on the basketball court. In the Lions' four games between Dec. 29 to Jan. 4, Matos averaged 24.3 points per game, including a 32-point outing in a 62-30 win over Mt. Shasta at the Jamie Angley Classic. Matos also scored 25 points to help the Lions take down Foothill on Saturday, Jan. 3. The senior shot 50% (22/44) from behind the arc in that four-game stretch and is quickly establishing himself as one of the premier scorers in the North State.\n\nMore: Fan vote: Redding-area midseason boys basketball player of the year\n\nTeam Contributions: Enterprise junior Cat Ahart has been one of the most unstoppable scorers this season, and her 20.7 points per game rank second in the Northern Section. Ahart can easily get to the cup, pull up from midrange and knock down threes. In a win against Burney on Jan. 1, Ahart recorded 25 points, seven rebounds and four blocks. She followed that up with a 29-point game against Modoc the following day. Enterprise has jumped out to an impressive 11-4 record, and Ahart's scoring abilities have played a big role in the Hornets' success.\n\nMore: Fan vote: Redding-area midseason girls basketball player of the year\n\nTo nominate an athlete, please follow this link or submit nominations to sports reporter Brett Abrams at Brett.Abrams@redding.com.\n\nBrett Abrams is a sports reporter for the Record Searchlight/USA Today Network.

    "fullText": "Why did Ravens fire John Harbaugh? Long-time Baltimore coach out after missing playoffs originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter 18 years, John Harbaugh and the Baltimore Ravens are splitting up.\n\nThe Ravens are moving on from Harbaugh after missing the playoffs in heartbreaking fashion this season, charting a new course as they try to get back into Super Bowl contention with two-time MVP Lamar Jackson as the face of the franchise.\n\nIn a statement, Ravens coach Steve Bisciotti called the move \"an incredibly difficult decision\" but did not explain the decision any further.\n\nHarbaugh released a lengthy statement as well thanking the Ravens and their fans:\n\n— Baltimore Ravens (@Ravens) January 6, 2026\n\nHarbaugh was the NFL's second-longest tenured head coach behind only Mike Tomlin. Hired in 2008 after serving as a special teams and DBs coach under Andy Reid, Harbaugh won a Super Bowl in his fifth season and had only two losing seasons in his final decade in Baltimore.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the Ravens' decision to part ways with Harbaugh.\n\nMORE:Ranking the 6 best candidates to replace John Harbaugh\n\nNo one would say Harbaugh's tenure in Baltimore wasn't a success — he won a Super Bowl and had only three losing seasons in 18 years — but very few coaches get to end on their own terms. For the Ravens and Harbaugh, each side might see this moment as the right time for a fresh start.\n\nIt isn't Harbaugh's fault that Tyler Loop missed a potential AFC North-winning kick, but the Ravens ended in that position partly because of inexcusable losses, namely a late-game collapse against the Buffalo Bills in Week 1 and a home blowout at the hands of the Cincinnati Bengals on Thanksgiving.\n\nBlown leads became all too common under Harbaugh. The Ravens blew eight double-digit leads in the last four seasons, easily outpacing other AFC contenders, and the franchise wasn't experiencing the playoff success to make up for it. Baltimore's only AFC championship game appearance with Jackson at quarterback was a loss as a home favorite, and Harbaugh's last playoff run with multiple wins came all the way back in 2012, when he guided the Ravens to a championship.\n\nThe defense's decline after Mike Macdonald's departure two years ago defined Harbaugh's final two seasons, and the offense took a step back in 2025 even when Jackson was on the field.\n\nAccording to The Athletic's Dianna Russini, the idea firing offensive coordinator Todd Monken was a point of contention between the two sides, with Harbaugh resisting the suggestion.\n\nWith only two years remaining on Jackson's contract, the Ravens have to commit to their quarterback as early as this offseason. To win a Super Bowl with him, they decided a different direction was needed.\n\nJohn Harbaugh's four best landing spots\n\nLongest-tenured NFL coaches after John Harbaugh firing\n\nRevisiting last Ravens coach before John Harbaugh\n\nHow Ravens firing John Harbaugh impacts Lamar Jackson's future\n\nHarbaugh's 180 wins rank 14th in NFL history and ranked fourth among all active coaches before his exit from Baltimore. He had only three losing seasons with the Ravens, including an 8-9 finish in 2025.\n\nHarbaugh has a career 13-11 record in the playoffs, including a Super Bowl 47 win.\n\nMORE:What no Mahomes, Jackson, Burrow means for AFC playoffs\n\nWhile most coaches are used to shuffling from team to team, Harbaugh has made only two stops in his entire NFL career.\n\nHarbaugh joined the Philadelphia Eagles in 1998 as special teams coordinator after getting started in the college ranks, and he spent nine years in the position before shifting to defensive backs coach in 2007.\n\nAfter Brian Billick was fired at the end of the 2007 season, the Ravens took a gamble on Harbaugh despite not having experience as an offensive or defensive coordinator. Ultimately, that gamble paid off.\n\nHarbaugh is 63 years old. He is older than his brother, Jim, and ranked as one of the NFL's oldest head coaches before his exit from Baltimore.\n\nThough many NFL teams are preferring to go younger when they search for head coaches, Harbaugh still appears energized and doesn't figure to have a hard time drawing head coaching interest around the league, whether this cycle or the next.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nVery few NFL head coaches last longer than a few years with one team, and even then, most don’t get to finish on their own terms.\n\nA handful of current head coaches have bucked that trend and made themselves fixtures with one team, even if no coaching stint is ever permanent.\n\nHere’s a look at the NFL’s longest-tenured head coaches after John Harbaugh’s firing as Baltimore Ravens coach.\n\nMORE:Why the Ravens fired John Harbaugh after 18 years\n\nHere are the eight longest tenured active NFL head coaches:\n\nMike Tomlin is the NFL’s longest-tenured coach and has been since Bill Belichick and the New England Patriots parted ways after the 2023 season. Hired to replace a retiring Bill Cowher in early 2007, Tomlin has never had a losing season in 19 years as head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers and has guided the team to two Super Bowl appearances, including a win in his second season. If Tomlin decides to stick around for 2026, he will reach two decades with the Steelers.\n\nIt's hard to believe the NFL's second longest tenured coach could have another head coaching stint that matches his current one, but Andy Reid is heading into his 14th season with the Kansas City Chiefs after 14 years with the Philadelphia Eagles. Hired to bring some stability after a tumultuous 2012 season, Reid has beaten all expectations with the Chiefs, guiding the team to three Super Bowl wins and five AFC championships with Patrick Mahomes at quarterback after a strong first five years on the job.\n\nNo Buffalo Bills coach since Marv Levy had lasted more than four seasons until Sean McDermott came along. McDermott replaced Rex Ryan in 2017 and immediately guided the Bills to their first playoff appearance in 18 years, a preview of some of the success to come with Josh Allen at quarterback. While getting to the Super Bowl is still just a goal for McDermott, he has been one of the NFL's winningest coaches since he was hired in Buffalo.\n\nMORE:Ranking the 6 best candidates to replace John Harbaugh\n\nIf you could start an NFL team today, there likely aren’t many — or any — coaches you would take over Sean McVay. A little-known 30-year-old wunderkind when the Los Angeles Rams hired him to replace Jeff Fisher in 2017, McVay led an instant turnaround of a downtrodden franchise and took the Rams to the Super Bowl in his second season. He reached the pinnacle with a Super Bowl win in his fifth season, and his tenure in L.A. seems more likely to end on his terms than the team’s when all is said and done.\n\nAfter a bumpy first two seasons in San Francisco, Kyle Shanahan established himself as one of the NFL's premier coaches and has taken the 49ers to the Super Bowl twice in nine seasons on the job. Shanahan has navigated near-constant injuries and turned Brock Purdy into a franchise quarterback, making a Super Bowl ring just about all that eludes the franchise during his tenure.\n\nMORE: Ranking all 14 teams' chances at winning Super Bowl 60\n\nHere are the five longest head coaching stints in NFL history, headlined by a pair of legends.\n\nIf Tomlin continues on as head coach of the Steelers in 2026, he will still need to coach the team through the 2030 season to match Belichick's 24-year run with the Patriots and through the 2035 season to tie the all-time mark of 29 years.\n\nJohn Harbaugh's four best landing spots\n\nRevisiting last Ravens coach before John Harbaugh\n\nHow Ravens firing John Harbaugh impacts Lamar Jackson's future",

    "fullText": "How Ravens firing John Harbaugh impacts Lamar Jackson's future in Baltimore originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens will need a new head coach for the first time in 19 years. That means Lamar Jackson will play for a new head coach for the first time in his ninth NFL season.\n\nWith John Harbaugh gone, despite winning 193 games including the playoffs and delivering a Super Bowl ring, Jackson will need to mesh with a different leader going forward. Despite Harbaugh's overall success, the head coach went only 3-5 in five playoff trips with Jackson and missed the postseason in 2025.\n\nThere is some speculation Ravens officials might reset the entire franchise on the field, including trying trade to Jackson.\n\nHere's the what Harbaugh's departure could mean for Jackson's future in Baltimore:\n\nGreg Roman helped lead Jackson to an MVP season in Year 2 as the Ravens tailored their offense early to his dynamic running while he developed into a complete passer. Once Jackson refined his game, there was a natural evolution to his more balanced and explosive MVP year in 2023 under Todd Monken.\n\nMORE: Four landing spots for John Harbaugh after stunning firing\n\nBaltimore's offense has been predicated a lot the running game in the Jackson era, with Derrick Henry's presence over the past two seasons setting up Jackson to be more effective passing downfield and tougher to stop as a runner. Unfortunately, Jackson's durability issues in 2025 contributed to the offense struggling enough to miss the playoffs while facing a tough schedule.\n\nThere was some pressure on Harbaugh to make yet another change with Monken after how the season ended. Now Monken will be finding a job, and maybe fill one of the other six head-coaching vacancies.\n\nMORE: Top landing spots for Kliff Kingsbury\n\nKliff Kingsbury, who was just fired by the Commanders, would seem like the ideal offensive coordinator (or play-calling head coach) to pair with Jackson after his top-level work with Kyler Murray and Jayden Daniels. The Ravens could also try to tap into the Rams' staff for passing game specialist Nathan Scheelhaase to call plays, if not straight up hiring their OC, Mike LaFleur, to be the new coach.\n\nThe Ravens have been used to Harbaugh's coaching demeanor for a long time. And now there's plenty of shock in the locker room after losing a familial presence. There are plenty of veterans who must get ready for a tough adjustment.\n\nNow the constant voice, heart and soul of the Ravens team belongs to Jackson, who has been the starting quarterback for nearly a decade. With the defense need of an overhaul, it's on Jackson to ease the transition with his stability. Jackson was attached to the hip of Harbaugh in many ways. This is Jackson's team now should he stay, with the new head coach having more of the adjusting to do.\n\nJackson still has two more locked-in years on his contract. He turns only 29 on Wednesday, a day after Harbaugh's firing, so he has plenty of prime years left.\n\nThe Ravens can't rule out trading Jackson away, given a lot of teams will be in QB transition again. The Raiders and Jets are at the top of the list and have been tied to top draft prospects Fernando Mendoza and Dante Moore. But the 2026 class has some real questions beyond that promising pair. The Browns, Cardinals, Vikings and Jackson's hometown Dolphins can join the fray in making a big QB change, too.\n\nBaltimore officials will give away whether Jackson is still in the team's plans by their direction for the next coach and OC. Should they be more Jackson-friendly offensive hires, that's an indication the Ravens just wanted a fresh overall approach, still feeling their QB is committed to the organization. The Ravens might seem crazy to move Jackson, but it's the better move for them if they can't committing to what he needs to succeed.",

    "fullText": "What's next for John Harbaugh? Four landing spots for former Ravens' coach after stunning dismissal originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter 18 seasons and more than 180 wins, the Ravens finally parted ways with John Harbaugh on Tuesday evening.\n\nHarbaugh, 63, is the franchise's most decorated head coach, having posted a 180-113 record in regular season play. A former AP Coach of the Year winner and Super Bowl champion, Harbaugh is expected to field countless offers from other NFL teams. Baltimore didn't perform like it's accustomed to across his final few years in town. But his experience makes him a qualified candidate for where he takes his talents next.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Harbaugh's next steps following his shock Baltimore departure.\n\nLongest-tenured NFL coaches after John Harbaugh firing\n\nRevisiting last Ravens coach before John Harbaugh\n\nHow Ravens firing John Harbaugh impacts Lamar Jackson's future\n\nWhile the final few years of Harbaugh's Ravens career soured his reputation in Charm City, he still is a popular figure around league circles. ESPN's Adam Schefter stated that Harbaugh's dismissal is expected to prompt multiple teams with head coaching openings to \"readjust their boards.\" NFL Network's Mike Garafolo reported that Harbaugh is considered the top head-coaching candidate in this year's hiring cycle.\n\nThe Falcons surprisingly let go of Raheem Morris on Black Monday, spelling an end to the 49-year-old's two-year stint in Atlanta. The Falcons fell one game short of postseason play, downing each of its final four foes to breathe life into a dormant fanbase. While the Falcons are still seeking a long-term answer under center, they're well-positioned to compete in a fairly underwhelming NFC South.\n\nAt 63 years old, Harbaugh might not have the desire to take part in a lengthy rebuild in the hopes of building a playoff contender. Atlanta, with its rich collection of talent -- namely Drake London, Bijan Robinson and Chris Lindstrom -- offers a strong platform to succeed in the short-term. With Matt Ryan expected to feature prominently in Atlanta's head-coaching search, the Falcons are looking for a statement hire to man the headset in 2026. No coaching candidate would represent a bigger get than Harbaugh.\n\nMany of the sides with coaching vacancies have yet to find their quarterback of the future. The Giants are one notable exception, though, finding success with Jaxson Dart during his maiden season in the Big Apple.\n\nDart tallied 2,800 yards of total offense and 24 total touchdowns across 12 starts as a rookie. He showed flashes of brilliance while draped in blue-and-white, striking up strong partnerships with Cam Skattebo and Wandale Robinson. He also delivered the vast majority of his production without star wideout Malik Nabers, who missed nearly the whole season after suffering a torn ACL.\n\nDart, Skattebo and Nabers make for a compelling young core. New York is far from competitive at the moment. But its youthfulness and strong draft position could prove enticing for many, including Harbaugh, who is expected to have the pick of the litter when it comes to determining his next home. According to Schefter, he has already emerged as one of the favorites for the Giants' gig.\n\nUncertainty abounds in Las Vegas, as the Raiders find themselves without a head coach at the end of their season for the second time in as many years.\n\nThe Raiders have some pieces, including reigning All-Pro tight end Brock Bowers, star pass-rusher Maxx Crosby and former No. 6 overall pick running back Ashton Jeanty. The holes are certainly glaring within the franchise's roster. Geno Smith looks far-removed from his Seahawks prime while the Raiders' defense is adorned with middling pieces.\n\nLas Vegas will get a reprieve with the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. That could be appealing for Harbaugh, who would get a chance to leave an immediate imprint on the roster. Fernando Mendoza and Dante Moore are expected to be in contention for the top pick. Both would figure to get a chance to learn and develop under Harbaugh.\n\nThe Titans have been in a steady free fall in recent years, struggling to tally wins across the past two seasons. Cam Ward's matriculation to the NFL had some good moments. But Tennessee's 3-14 record indicates that the team is far away from mounting any legitimate claim the postseason.\n\nWard's final numbers weren't the gaudiest; he completed less than 60 percent, tossed seven interceptions and failed to make much of an impact in the run game.\n\nStill, there's little reason to believe Ward won't be the team's starter for the foreseeable future. Harbaugh could view Ward as a captivating piece, one who could prove an anchor for a steady postseason contender if he is able to progress quickly.",

He has to score,” said Allegri.\n\n“He did score in Cagliari even if he wasn’t fully fit; this discomfort has been bothering him. He can only improve, given that in the first part of the season, he missed quite a few matches due to calf and adductor problems. The same goes for Nkunku, who won’t be available tomorrow. We hope to have him back in Florence, as the knock on his ankle is still bothering him.”\n\nMultiple sources in Italy claim that Milan are close to reaching an agreement to extend Mike Maignan’s contract and Allegri was asked a comment on the matter: “The club is working on Milan’s future. There are many excellent players, and the club is working to build an important future. It’s also important that we finish in the top four,” the coach said.\n\nThe Rossoneri have already signed a new striker, Niclas Fullkrug, who made his Serie A debut in the previous round.\n\n“He’s improving his shape. In Cagliari, he made himself available and showed characteristics we don’t have. He made a good impression,” Allegri said.\n\nCAGLIARI, ITALY – JANUARY 02: Rafael Leao of Milan in action during the Serie A match between Cagliari Calcio and AC Milan at Stadio Sant’Elia on January 02, 2026 in Cagliari, Italy.

I have a club that takes care of Milan’s future, and Furlani and Tare are working, so I’m very calm.”\n\nAllegri also commented on Luka Modric and Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s performances so far.\n\n“Modric is not a technical surprise; what stands out is the passion he has for his work and, above all, the humility with which he shows up at training,” said the Milan coach.\n\n“It makes me laugh that when he misplaces a pass, he gets angry with himself and apologises. He is a great example for the younger players.\n\n“I’m very happy with what Ruben is doing. Yesterday, he trained separately, but tomorrow he’ll be available. He has to switch and be more decisive in the box. He has great potential and must be more decisive in the air as well, but I’m very happy with him.”",

    "title": "Why the 2026 MotoGP season is shaping up to be a transitional year",
    "description": "This is why all signs point toward 2026 being a transitional year for MotoGP's five manufacturers",
    "fullText": "The status quo established and dominated by Ducati, together with the introduction of the new technical regulations from 2027 onwards, means that most manufacturers competing in the MotoGP world championship are approaching 2026 as a year of transition.\n\nThe four consecutive titles amassed by the Italian brand since 2022 are the clearest evidence of its superiority under the current regulatory framework. However, that landscape will give way to a completely new one the following year, with the introduction of 850cc bikes and revised aerodynamics.\n\nIt's a change that opens a window of opportunity for the other manufacturers, who hope to seize the chance to fight at the front again. In terms of performance and results, Aprilia is currently the constructor closest to Ducati, although the numbers still show that the Noale-based manufacturer is not yet in a position to be considered a genuine threat. KTM appears to have put behind it — at least temporarily — the economic turmoil that shook the company and its racing division. Honda is hoping to consolidate the recovery shown last season, while Yamaha is banking on the massive investment it has made finally starting to bear fruit.\n\nWith all of the above in mind, logic and testimony from several contenders point to 2026 being a transitional year for a number of reasons. First of all, it is worth noting that engines have been frozen since the beginning of 2025, eliminating any development margin for one of the most complex components of the bikes. In addition, the bike update schedule will also differ significantly from what could be considered conventional.\n\nThe arrival of the new regulations in 2027 will mean that the vast majority of upgrades are introduced during the first part of the season. “Before the summer break — scheduled for July — I will already be focusing exclusively on the 2027 bike,” admits Aleix Espargaro, Honda test rider.\n\nAlong the same lines, tyre specifications will remain unchanged, given Michelin’s exit at the end of 2026 and Pirelli’s arrival in 2027. The French supplier’s plan for its final year in MotoGP includes reducing the available front tyre specifications from three to two, as well as halting the introduction of a new front compound.\n\nThis shift in priorities is further reinforced by the desire of certain teams to convince riders they want to retain — or, in some cases, sign. Yamaha, KTM and Honda are particularly under pressure in this regard. The Iwata-based brand would love Fabio Quartararo to renew his deal, which expires at the end of 2026. ‘El Diablo’ appears to be running out of patience, at least judging by the statements he has made in recent months, and is still waiting for a performance breakthrough from the M1 that would be compelling enough to persuade him not to look elsewhere.\n\nKTM finds itself in a similar situation with Pedro Acosta. The rider from Murcia already explored the possibility of an early exit at the end of 2025, one year before his contract expires, but the executives in Mattighofen did not even sit down to negotiate a compensation figure. Acosta has Ducati and Honda in his sights, and KTM knows that its slim remaining chances of extending its relationship with the Spaniard hinge on delivering him a rocket ship during pre-season that makes him hesitate, especially as Motorsport.com understands that Acosta's intention is to have his future settled before the championship begins in Thailand in early March.\n\nAs for Honda, the Tokyo-based factory is, on paper, the manufacturer that improved the most compared to 2024, scoring 25% more points. Whether that indicator is representative enough to conclude that the Japanese giant has truly awakened from its slumber will become clearer in the coming months.\n\nAlthough no participant will openly admit to being more focused on the 2027 project than on the championship that gets underway in Thailand next March, reality points in that direction. “No one should expect the picture to be very different this year, because things will be more or less the same as in the past,” a Honda executive told Motorsport.com.\n\nYamaha shares Honda's point of view. With an eye on 2027, it has reshuffled its structure and regained its satellite team, hoping that this injection of capital would translate into on-track performance — something that has yet to materialise. Yamaha already split its efforts last season, racing the M1 with the inline four-cylinder engine while developing the V4 in parallel, with Augusto Fernandez already competing with it at some rounds on the calendar.\n\nAprilia’s performance is also unlikely to differ significantly from what it delivered last season, although the main question mark surrounds Jorge Martin and how he will approach the second year of his contract after a first one plagued by setbacks. The RS-GP can certainly continue to improve, but statistics highlight that, over the course of a full championship, it remains a long way from the Desmosedici. Considering the effort Aprilia has to make for parent company Piaggio to release funds under normal circumstances, it will probably be even harder on the eve of a regulatory change that will require a higher-than-usual investment.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu hailed as ‘Casey Stoner 2.0’ ahead of MotoGP debut\n\nHow concessions narrowed Ducati’s edge in MotoGP\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "BBC Sport profiles twin brothers Tyler and Jack Fletcher, who will hope to get minutes at Manchester United under interim head coach and father Darren",
    "fullText": "Manchester United interim manager Darren Fletcher's twin sons are both currently midfielders at the club.\n\nThe 19-year-old academy duo featured as part of Ruben Amorim's final few matches in charge of United prior to his dismissal as head coach on Monday.\n\nFormer United midfielder and under-18s head coach Darren was promoted to interim head coach in Amorim's place and will take charge of United's trip to Burnley on Wednesday.\n\nWhile Tyler has made the bench in each of United's last three games, Jack was used by Amorim in United's last three matches of 2025 as a substitute.\n\nThe brothers are central midfielders. While both can play more defensively, Jack has also played as a winger on the right side.\n\nThe duo are capped internationally. Although they both started with England's under-16s, Tyler switched nationalities to Scotland - the nation his father represented.\n\nTyler and Jack played against each other in November 2025 during a Under-19s European Championship qualifier between Scotland and England.\n\nIn July 2023, the pair signed for United from direct rivals Manchester City for a reported combined fee of £1.25m.\n\nAlthough there was an element of surprise when Jack Fletcher was named in Ruben Amorim's squad for the trip to Tottenham in November, after Kobbie Mainoo pulled out due to injury, in terms of available midfielders he was next in line.\n\nBoth Jack and Tyler have been central figures in Travis Binnion's Under-21 squad this season. While results against senior teams in both the EFL Trophy and National League Cup have not been exceptional this season, United's Under-21 side go into the second half of the Premier League 2 campaign with an excellent record of seven wins and a single defeat from their eight games. The Fletcher brothers are part of that.\n\nJack is viewed as slightly more progressive in his passing, and tends to play higher up the pitch. He has also featured at full-back at times, which may be an advantage when it comes to making matchday squads at senior level.\n\nBoth were part of Manchester City's academy at one stage, and while Darren Fletcher is evidently a guiding light in their careers, he has been keen to let the pair make their own decisions in terms of their playing journey - including which international team they wanted to represent.\n\nTyler is also good on the ball, but is yet to score this season, which Jack has. However, he is also still to be sent off, which is what happened to Jack in the EFL Trophy at Barnsley, when he objected to a refereeing decision in a manner the referee found unacceptable.\n\nShould either of the Fletcher twins play under father Darren while he is in interim charge of United, they would join an exclusive club of sons to have played under the management of their fathers in the Premier League.\n\nJamie Redknapp played under dad Harry at Southampton, while former United centre-back Steve Bruce managed son Alex at Hull.\n\nAlso at Old Trafford, Sir Alex Ferguson handed 18 Premier League appearances to son Darren during the first half of the 1992-93 season.\n\nIn that same season, Nigel Clough played every match under father Brian at Nottingham Forest.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nWhy is the Spanish Super Cup played in Saudi Arabia?\n\nThe cricketer's son recalled by Guardiola - who is Max Alleyne?\n\nIs the new manager bounce real or a myth?\n\nHow does Amorim's record compare to other Man Utd managers?",

Fork it, sell it, run it however you want.\n\nKafka brokers were designed for a disk-centric world where durability lived on local machines.\n Replication and rebalancing were necessary because broker state was the source of truth.\n\nObject storage changes this model.\n Once log segments are durable, immutable, and external, long-lived broker state stops adding resilience\n and starts adding operational cost.\n\nStateless brokers backed by object storage simplify failure, scaling, and recovery.\n Brokers become ephemeral compute. Data remains durable.\n\nKafScale is built on this assumption.\n The Kafka protocol still matters. Broker-centric storage does not.\n\nKafScale is not a drop-in replacement for every Kafka workload. Here's when it fits and when it doesn't.\n\nClients speak the Kafka protocol to stateless brokers. Brokers flush segments to S3 and serve reads with caching. Processors read completed segments directly from S3 without adding load to brokers.\n\nTraditional Kafka forces all reads through brokers. Streaming consumers and batch analytics compete for the same resources. Backfills spike broker CPU. AI training jobs block production consumers.\n\nKafScale stores data in S3 using a documented segment format. Processors read directly from S3 without touching brokers. The streaming path and the analytical path share data but never interfere.\n\nKafScale keeps processing separate from the broker layer. Processors read completed segments directly from S3, enabling independent scaling and custom implementations.

Zero broker load.\n\nThe .kfs segment format is documented and open. Build processors for your use case without waiting for vendors to ship features or negotiating enterprise contracts.\n\nAI agents making decisions need context. That context comes from historical events: what happened, in what order, and why the current state exists. Traditional stream processing optimizes for milliseconds. Agents need something different: completeness, replay capability, and the ability to reconcile current state with historical actions.\n\nStorage-native streaming makes this practical. The immutable log in S3 becomes the source of truth that agents query, replay, and reason over. The Iceberg Processor converts that log to tables that analytical tools understand. Agents get complete historical context without competing with streaming workloads for broker resources.\n\nTwo-second latency for analytical access is acceptable when the alternative is incomplete context or degraded streaming performance. AI agents do not need sub-millisecond reads. They need the full picture.\n\nS3 health state, produce/fetch throughput, consumer lag, etcd snapshot age. Grafana dashboards included.\n\nAdd brokers instantly. No partition rebalancing. HPA scales on CPU or custom metrics.\n\nOperator snapshots etcd to S3 on a schedule.

As a full-time novelist in the US, and the only income producer in the family, I spend a lot of time considering all of the above. I love how you brought Brian Eno into it.

I need to stay in my lane to some degree, meaning I can't abruptly change genres or write something that doesn't have page-turning momentum without risking my income, but I can't simply fall into a cookie-cutter pattern or I risk casting my soul into the depths of Hades.

    "title": "History's Attention Gap",
    "description": "Buddha is #2 in historical importance. He got fewer views than Schwarzenegger. We analyzed 1,000 figures.",
    "fullText": "In 2025, he got fewer Wikipedia pageviews than Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nEvery year, MIT's Pantheon project ranks history's most globally influential figures using the Historical Popularity Index (HPI). This peer-reviewed metric synthesizes Wikipedia presence across 25+ languages, article length, and sustained view counts over time to measure lasting global influence.\n\nWe compared each figure's 2025 Wikipedia views to what you'd expect given their historical importance. The gap tells you who's internet-famous beyond their legacy and who history is forgetting. +10x means 10x more attention than expected. -10x means 10x less.\n\nWe took their top 1,000 figures and compared their \"importance\" ranking to their actual 2025 Wikipedia pageviews. The gap between who history says matters and who we actually look up is striking.\n\nSome of history's most consequential figures are practically invisible online. Not because they don't matter, but because pop culture has moved on.\n\nSchwarzenegger gets 15x more attention than Buddha, despite being ranked 616 places lower in historical importance. To be fair, Arnold was also a seven-time Mr. Olympia, Hollywood's biggest action star, and Governor of California. But Buddha's teachings shaped half a billion lives across 2,500 years. The gap is striking.\n\nMuhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi (#92 in importance) invented the algorithms that power every computer, phone, and search engine you use. He gets less traffic in a year than Donald Trump gets in a single day.\n\nThe pattern holds across the top 10. Note how modern political figures dominate attention while foundational thinkers fade:\n\nTrump (#4 importance) gets 34.5 million views. Buddha (#2 importance) gets 410,000. That's an 84x difference. The gap reveals something uncomfortable: we've built an internet that amplifies controversy over wisdom.\n\nOur analysis identified the figures with the largest gap between importance and attention. These people shaped civilization but barely register online:\n\nLouis XVI, the king whose execution launched the French Revolution and reshaped Western democracy, gets 71,000 annual views. That's less than many YouTube cooking tutorials.\n\n2025 was the year of the papacy. On May 8, the Catholic Church elected Pope Leo XIV, the first American pope in history. Robert Francis Prevost, a Chicago native who spent two decades serving the poor in Peru, became the 267th successor to Saint Peter.\n\nThat's not a typo. Leo XIV went from 152 annual views in 2024 to 17.6 million in 2025. It's the single largest attention spike in our dataset by several orders of magnitude.\n\nThe papal election created a halo effect across Catholic history. People didn't just look up the new pope; they explored his predecessors and namesakes:\n\nEven Pope Leo I (who died in 461 AD) saw a 358% spike because people were curious about the \"Leo\" lineage.\n\nThe 66 popes in our dataset generated 67 million pageviews. That's more than 2x the attention received by the entire 20th century's worth of Nobel Prize winners in our data.\n\nWhen famous people die, Wikipedia views spike. But what happens next?\n\nJimmy Carter died on December 29, 2024, at age 100, becoming the longest-lived U.S. president in history. His death generated a massive spike in the final days of 2024 and early January 2025. But by spring, views had collapsed:\n\nFrom 79.7 million views in 2024 to 6.7 million in 2025. His momentum within 2025 is also -78%, meaning views are still falling.\n\nDavid Lynch, the legendary filmmaker behind Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet, died on January 16, 2025. His views surged +210% year-over-year. But his momentum within 2025 is -85%, meaning the spike was entirely concentrated in January. By February, people had moved on.\n\nThe pattern repeated at year's end. Brigitte Bardot, the French actress and animal rights activist, died on December 28, 2025. Her December views alone (2.7M) exceeded her entire 2024 total (1.4M). She finished the year up +182%, but almost all of that came in the final week.\n\nJames Watson, co-discoverer of DNA's double helix structure, died on November 6, 2025. His November spike (503K views) was 15x his normal monthly average. Year-over-year he's up +128%, but Q4 momentum of +537% tells the real story: it's a death bump, not sustained interest.\n\nThe \"death bump\" creates a paradox: figures can show strong YoY growth while simultaneously crashing in momentum. We call these post-peak figures.\n\nHollywood has the same problem. Movies create attention spikes that evaporate quickly.\n\nChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer won seven Academy Awards and grossed nearly $1 billion worldwide. It made the physicist a household name for one summer. Now he's fading back into the academic obscurity he occupied before. This is the lifecycle of culturally-driven attention: spike, plateau, decline.\n\nBut 2025 also showed films can create new spikes. Hermann Göring, the Nazi leader, saw Q4 momentum of +254% after Russell Crowe portrayed him in Nuremberg, released November 2025. Alfred Hitchcock spiked +306% in Q4, driven by the 70th anniversary of Alfred Hitchcock Presents and a major 4K restoration box set. And Bruce Lee surged +663% Q4 amid buzz around Ang Lee's upcoming biopic starring his son Mason Lee, pushing Bruce Lee to +116% YoY despite no film actually releasing.\n\nThe good news: some figures are building sustained momentum, not just spike-and-crash patterns:\n\nSophocles, the ancient Greek playwright, is seeing sustained growth throughout 2025. The Athens Epidaurus Festival celebrated its 50th anniversary with major productions of Antigone, Oedipus Rex, and Electra. Unlike death bumps, this interest built through the summer theatre season.\n\nWilliam McKinley is an interesting case: he's down -56% in momentum (January spike faded) but up +42% YoY overall. Trump's frequent praise of the \"tariff king\" and renaming Denali back to Mount McKinley drove curiosity about a largely forgotten president.\n\nOf all the eras we analyzed, ancient figures (born before 0 CE) are the only group with a negative average year-over-year change.\n\nHere's how attention breaks down by era:\n\nThe 1900+ era shows a massive skew due to Pope Leo XIV's unprecedented spike, but even without that outlier, modern figures dominate attention.\n\nThe biggest casualty? Cleopatra.\n\nThat's more than Newton, Einstein, and Gandhi combined. She went from 50.4M views in 2024 to 19.5M in 2025.\n\nWhat happened? In 2023, Netflix released Queen Cleopatra, a controversial docudrama that sparked heated debate about historical representation. The controversy drove enormous curiosity. Egypt's government protested. Lawyers filed complaints. The series became one of Netflix's most talked-about releases.\n\nOther ancient figures in decline:\n\nThis pattern suggests ancient history needs constant cultural reinforcement (films, books, curriculum) to maintain public attention. Without it, these figures slowly fade from collective memory.\n\nSome figures resonate far beyond what historical metrics would predict:\n\nMusk is ranked 270 places lower than Newton but gets 7x more attention. His momentum is -79%, meaning his views were heavily concentrated in January 2025 (around the presidential inauguration) and have declined since.\n\nThese figures capture outsized attention relative to their historical ranking:\n\nBob Dylan, who surged +70% this year thanks to the A Complete Unknown biopic and ongoing cultural relevance, ranks #736 in importance but #6 in views. Al Capone, a gangster, outperforms most Renaissance artists.\n\nThis isn't a criticism. These figures created work or personas that resonate deeply with living audiences. But it does reveal how the internet's attention favors entertainment and recent memory over foundational historical impact.\n\nPoliticians dominate total views, but some occupations show interesting patterns:\n\nPhysicists are in trouble. The 37 physicists in our dataset are declining faster than any other occupation at -16.3% YoY. This includes giants like Einstein, Bohr, and Heisenberg. The decline suggests waning public interest in science's foundational figures.\n\nFilm Directors are rising. The +34.7% average is driven partly by David Lynch's death spike, but directors as a category are holding attention better than most.\n\nActors turned positive. Last year actors were declining, but 2025's December deaths (Brigitte Bardot) and biopic buzz (Bruce Lee) pushed actors to +5.6% average YoY.\n\nThe attention gap isn't inherently bad. It reflects what we're curious about right now. Current events (elections, papal transitions, celebrity deaths) naturally dominate short-term interest.\n\nBut the data reveals structural patterns worth considering:\n\nThe 200 figures born after 1900 command 553 million views, nearly 5x more than the 121 figures from ancient times (113 million). Modern figures benefit from living memory, photographs, video footage, and ongoing news coverage. Ancient figures lack these advantages.\n\nCleopatra's 2023 Netflix controversy drove 50 million views in 2024. By 2025, it dropped to 19.5 million. The attention was real but not sticky. Controversy creates spikes, not sustained interest.\n\nAl-Khwarizmi invented the algorithms that power modern computing. His name literally gives us the word \"algorithm.\" Yet he gets 74,000 views annually. This suggests that figures not emphasized in standard curricula fade from public consciousness.\n\nWithout movies, TV shows, or viral moments, historical figures slowly lose attention. Ancient history's -6.5% YoY decline suggests that without fresh cultural products (films, games, books), these figures will continue fading.\n\nWikipedia pageviews measure curiosity, not importance. When Jimmy Carter dies, people look him up. When Oppenheimer wins Best Picture, views spike. Wikipedia captures the world's attention, but that attention follows external events rather than creating them.\n\nThis research raises questions without easy answers:\n\nWe don't have definitive answers. But we think the questions are worth exploring.\n\nThat's partly why we made this research. And it's partly why we make a podcast that tries to make history as interesting as it deserves to be.\n\nWe've made all 1,000 figures available to explore, filter, and download. Find your own stories in the data.\n\nOur podcast makes history come alive for kids ages 4-12 with daily episodes about the world's most fascinating figures and events. Maybe together we can close the attention gap.",

    "fullText": "While looking down the back of the Internet for something or other, I stumbled across Time Magazine's Best Inventions of 2001.\n\nIt has been a quarter of a century since 2001 (!!) so that's a good excuse to look back at what stood the test of time. The article states:\n\nInventions come in all shapes and sizes. Some are as simple as purple catsup. Others push the limits of quantum physics. The real measure of an invention is not just how well it works or how impressively it is engineered, but how it changes our lives.\n\nI don't think I've ever seen purple ketchup in the UK, but I'm prepared to believe it is life changing for some. What about the rest? Here's what people at the turn of the century thought would have an impact on our era.\n\nGinger? The name tickled something at the back of my brain. Oh! Yeah! Project Ginger!\n\nAfter the Harvard Business School Press advanced $250,000 for a book about It—a top-secret project under development by one of the most accomplished inventors in the U.S.—reams of newsprint were devoted to speculation about what It might be. The recipient of the advance, author Steve Kemper, gushed in his book proposal that It—code-named Ginger—would revolutionize personal transportation, urban design and our daily lives. Apple Computer ceo Steve Jobs said It could be bigger than the PC.\n\nNow, look, I've enjoyed every time I've ridden a Segway. They're great for tourist exploration of a city (where licenced) and even for a bit of off-roading. But I've never seen a commuter on one. I remember seeing airport police using them to cruise round an airport. But other than that…\n\nGinger / Segway was the ultimate in hype exceeding reality. The Segway has had next to no impact on people's lives - other than the owner's ironic death. Electric bikes are everywhere - but none of them are self-balancing.\n\nThe Nuvaring is a hormonal birth control. Unlike the pill, it is used monthly. Unlike implants, it doesn't need to be inserted by a trained professional.\n\nSo, how did it do? Pretty well! It is still in use and regularly prescribed - there haven't been any major issues with it.\n\nThe UK produces lots of statistics about birth control methods. It seems that people are moving away from product like Nuvaring:\n\nOver the last ten years, LARC [long acting reversible contraceptives] uptake has been increasing and uptake of user dependent methods has been decreasing.\n\nI indistinctively love both these ideas. There were a plethora of wind-up products back in the day. The wind-up radio was transformative and truly helped change the world. The wind-up cellphone flopped. Phones became more efficient and batteries became more powerful.\n\nThe disposable phone is also an idea out of place. Originally designed for travellers who could pick up a temporary phone on their holidays. Cheap travel SIMs almost immediately obsoleted it.\n\nTwo rival companies are betting that drivers are sufficiently fed up with bad reception, tired playlists and irritating ads to fork out around $10 a month (plus up to $1,000 for a receiver) for dozens of stations\n\nThus was launched XM and Sirius's Digital Satellite Radio. By 2008 the companies had merged. While still operating in North America, it is extinct everywhere else.\n\nTerrestrial Digital Radio (via DAB) outlasted DSR.\n\nWhat's this? Something which actually made it!\n\nDesigned for extreme cold, the North Face MET5 jacket can keep you warm all by itself, thanks to a network of microscopic, waterproof heating elements woven into the fabric.\n\nYou can pick these up from £30! They're USB rechargeable and, so I'm told, toasty warm.\n\nSlow, pricey and impractical, electric cars for years have had a bad rap. Ford could start to change all that with its bubble-shaped City car, which hit the streets of Los Angeles, New York City and London this year. Running on 18 NiCad batteries, the City tops out at 65 m.p.h. but can travel only 55 miles between charges. Ford thinks it's the perfect commuter car—as long as you don't miss your exit.\n\nAvailability: Leases for $199 a month\n\nFord is comically absent from the future it created. But there are now a dozen different \"city cars\" which run on batteries. Some are little more than glorified quadricycles, others are full cars - albeit with limited ranges.\n\nThe $200 monthly lease is about £250 in today's money. And, yes, you can get a cheap lease for that. The market is still dominated by fossil-fuel cars, of course, and electrics tend to be large and expensive. But the Think Car's legacy lives on!\n\nOK, some of the inventions made a real difference - most notably the artificial heart and liver. While they might seem mundane now, natural colour light bulbs were a big deal back in the day.\n\nAnd, of course, we all use an automatic mashed potato machine as part of our daily lives. Right?\n\nBut most of the inventions are the sort of nonsense like jetpacks, office robots, and fuel cells.\n\nThere are glimmers of almost in there. The aforementioned fuel cell was attached to a bike - nowadays battery-powered bikes are ubiquitous. Similarly, the hydrogen scooter is now electrically powered.\n\nSome of the inventions, like the Gateshead Millennium Bridge are still around, although there don't appear to be many bridges like it. Sadly, most metropolises are still waiting for their self guided buses.\n\nInventing the future is difficult. Working out which inventions will stand the test of time is close to impossible.",

    "title": "Analysis: Cloudflare's permissive CAA injection nullifies RFC 8657",
    "description": "A deep-dive into how Cloudflare's Universal SSL undermines RFC 8657, creating a security gap exposing millions of domains to MitM attacks.",
    "fullText": "Your browser doesn't support HTML5 audio. You can download the audio file instead.\n\nCloudflare’s Universal SSL injects permissive CAA records that override user DNS constraints, causing certificate authorities to ignore strict account-binding checks.\n\nThis enables BGP hijacking and network interception to obtain unauthorized TLS certificates by bypassing accounturi and validationmethods.\n\nThe configuration replicates the gap exploited in the 2023 jabber.ru MitM, where intercepted traffic satisfied http-01 validation challenges.\n\nCloudflare must stop overriding user DNS records or fully implement RFC 8657 to restrict certificate issuance to the domain owner’s authorized ACME account.\n\nI have identified a significant, yet easily fixable security weakness in Cloudflare’s Universal SSL that affects millions of users, and my attempts to address it directly with Cloudflare [1a] have been… well, let’s call it “unsuccessful.”\n\nThe issue is best understood through the lens of the jabber.ru MitM attack [2], that took place in 2023. Back then, government-backed attackers were able to intercept traffic for jabber.ru at the network level. By doing this, they could satisfy the http-01 domain validation challenge from Let’s Encrypt and were issued a valid TLS certificate for the domain. They did not need to compromise the server itself.\n\nTo understand the problem, you need to understand the solution. The defense against this attack is built on two IETF standards.\n\nFirst, there’s the basic CAA standard, [3], which updates the original [4]. This is what you can call “brand-level trust.” It lets you put a record in your DNS that says:\n\nThis record tells all Certificate Authorities (CAs): “Only Let’s Encrypt can issue a certificate for my domain.”\n\nThis is good, but it’s not enough. It means anyone who can pass Let’s Encrypt’s validation challenge can get a cert. If an attacker hijacks your web server or (as in the jabber.ru case) your network traffic, they can pass the challenge and get a valid cert from your authorized CA.\n\nThis is where [5] comes in. It was published in November 2019 and was designed specifically to prevent this kind of attack. It’s an upgrade from “brand-level trust” to a “process-level trust.” It adds two critical parameters: accounturi and validationmethods.\n\nThe accounturi parameter is your “second factor.”\n\nIt’s a record that says: “Only Let’s Encrypt, using my specific account, can issue a certificate for my domain.”\n\nIf this had been in place for jabber.ru, the attackers’ request from their own Let’s Encrypt account would have been rejected by the CA, and the attack would have failed. The author of RFC 8657 (Hugo Landau) himself confirmed this in his paper Mitigating the Hetzner/Linode XMPP.ru MitM interception incident[6].\n\nThe validationmethods parameter is your “attack vector shield.”\n\nThis parameter lets you specify how the CA is allowed to validate your domain. This is the part that would have directly blocked the jabber.ru attack.\n\nIf jabber.ru had either of these RFC 8657 records, the attack would have been dead on arrival.\n\nNow, the core issue. As a B2B Product Manager, I don’t see this as a “bug”—I see it as a feature collision where the needs of a (badly designed) product feature are actively destroying user security.\n\nHere is the problem: When you use Cloudflare’s free Universal SSL, Cloudflare automatically adds its own CAA records for its partner CAs (Let’s Encrypt, Google Trust Services, etc.) [7a]. These records do not use the accounturi or validationmethods parameters.\n\nWorse, if you try to add your own secure CAA record (like the ones above, that I showed you), Cloudflare’s system sees it and says, “Oh, the user is adding a CAA record! I should ‘helpfully’ add my own permissive ones too! And if user’s records conflict with mine, I’ll just replace them with mine to make sure my system works smoothly.”\n\nSo the final DNS response looks like this:\n\nAccording to the rules, a CA is allowed to issue a certificate if any matching record permits it. Your secure record (1) correctly blocks the attacker, but Cloudflare’s injected record (2) replaces your own and it explicitly permits an malicious actor to undertake an attack.\n\nCloudflare’s “feature” actively and silently nullifies the IETF-standard security control. It recreates the exact vulnerability that jabber.ru suffered from for millions of its users.\n\nTo be fair (and to be more “academic”), Cloudflare isn’t the only one with this problem. This is a systemic flaw in any “integrated platform” that bundles “magic” automated SSL with hosting. The magic must override your security to function.\n\nThis shows a clear, industry-wide divide. “DNS-Only” providers sell you security and control. “Integrated Platforms” sell you convenience, often at the expense of security.\n\nWhile many platforms continued to ignore or override RFC 8657, the CA/Browser Forum moved to address the root cause at the validation layer. In July 2024 the Forum approved Ballot SC-067 v3, which requires Certificate Authorities to use Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration (MPIC) instead of relying on a single, local vantage point for domain validation.\n\nThe CA/Browser Forum specifically cites the 2018 Princeton paper Bamboozling Certificate Authorities with BGP [14a] as a primary motivation — the attack model described there is the exact threat MPIC is designed to mitigate.[15]\n\nThe vote record shows unusually broad agreement: major issuers and major platform consumers supported the change.\n\nAccording to the updated TLS Baseline Requirements and the ballot text, the rollout was staged:\n\nMPIC and RFC 8657 are complementary controls:\n\nIn short: MPIC significantly reduces the risk of mass or opportunistic BGP-based issuance attacks, but it does not remove the need for account-level locks (the protection RFC 8657 provides) when multi-tenant or delegated DNS operators are involved.\n\nCloudflare’s refusal to honour accounturi and validationmethods therefore remains a meaningful gap in defense-in-depth, even though MPIC should eliminate the easiest network-only attacks by 2025.\n\nThe jabber.ru incident is the primary, powerful case study, but the Web PKI is a graveyard of similar incidents that these standards were built to prevent.\n\nIn each case, accounturi or validationmethods would have provided a critical, preventative layer of defense.\n\nI’m not the first to notice this. I posted a detailed breakdown of this issue on the Cloudflare Community forum on 20 May 2025.\n\nHere is a verbatim summary in five acts from that thread [1b]:\n\nAct 1 (May 20): I submit the request “Critical Security Gap: Cloudflare Must Fully Support RFC 8657 CAA”.\n\nAct 2 (June 20): A Cloudflare Team member (mmalden) finally responds. They claim the feature isn’t supported because RFC 8657 isn’t fully passed (incorrect) and suggest Certificate Transparency logs as an alternative. This response is marked as the “Solution.”\n\nAct 3 (June 23): I post a detailed rebuttal, citing Cloudflare’s history of adopting draft protocols (TLS 1.3, QUIC) years before finalization, and pointing out that RFC 8657 is already a proposed standard. I conclude: “The only logical conclusion… is that withholding RFC 8657 support is a business decision.”\n\nA critical, user-reported security gap, with 1.3k views and 20 likes, was not properly “resolved.” It was auto-closed by a robot.\n\nTo bring more attention to this, I also published an article on the popular Russian tech site Habr.com [20] on June 15, 2025, which became the top post of the week. This shows the community understands the issue, even if Cloudflare’s support process is designed to ignore it.\n\nThe a Cloudflare team member claimed this is not a vulnerability and that they would comply “should RFC 8657 be passed.”\n\nThis response is, as I perceive, disingenuous.\n\nTo claim they must “wait” for this standard is inconsistent with their entire innovative culture. This isn’t technical lag; it’s a business decision.\n\nWhen mmalden from the Cloudflare Team responded, they stated they would comply “should RFC 8657 be passed.” This response—which was officially marked as the “Solution” to the thread—is demonstrably false and contradicts Cloudflare’s own engineering history.\n\nAs I pointed out in my rebuttal to the team:\n\nIn their 2018 blog post on QUIC, Cloudflare explicitly bragged about this culture: “The Cloudflare Systems Engineering Team has a long history of investing time and effort to trial new technologies, often before these technologies are standardised or adopted elsewhere.”\n\nYet, for RFC 8657 standard that closes a critical security hole, they claim they must wait for bureaucracy?\n\nFurthermore, the team suggested reliance on Certificate Transparency (CT) logs as a mitigation. As I explained to them, CT logs are a detection tool, not a prevention tool. They alert you after the attacker has already issued a fraudulent certificate and intercepted your traffic. This is a classic CWE-1188 weakness.\n\nThis confirms that the lack of support is not a technical oversight or a standards issue. It might be a conscious business decision to keep the “free” product vulnerable while gating secure CAA records behind paid plans.\n\nCloudflare, which powers a massive portion of the web (20.4% of all sites) and holds a dominant 81.6% market share among reverse proxy providers, should do the following: [27] [28]\n\nUntil Cloudflare updates their Universal SSL logic to respect user-defined accounturi and validationmethods parameters, there is no easy configuration for Free or Pro plan users that guarantees protection against this specific MitM vector.\n\nHowever, if your threat model requires strict CAA enforcement (RFC 8657), you can achieve it by taking full control of certificate issuance:\n\nI hope that with enough community attention, we can persuade Cloudflare to close this gap for everyone, not just their paying customers.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this! I hope it was useful.",

    "fullText": "Scientists are a step closer to solving one of the universe’s biggest mysteries as new research finds evidence that two of its least understood components may be interacting, offering a rare window into the darkest recesses of the cosmos.\n\nScientists are a step closer to solving one of the universe’s biggest mysteries as new research finds evidence that two of its least understood components may be interacting, offering a rare window into the darkest recesses of the cosmos.\n\nThe University of Sheffield findings relate to the relationship between dark matter, the mysterious, invisible substance that makes up around 85% of the matter in the universe, and neutrinos, one of the most fundamental and elusive subatomic particles. Scientists have overwhelming indirect evidence for the existence of dark matter, while neutrinos, though invisible and with an extremely small mass, have been observed using huge underground detectors.\n\nThe Standard Model of Cosmology (Lambda-CDM), with its origins in Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity, posits that dark matter and neutrinos exist independently and do not interact with one another.\n\nNew University of Sheffield research published in the Nature Astronomy journal casts doubt on this theory, challenging the long-standing cosmological model. The research detects signs that these elusive cosmic components may interact, offering a rare glimpse into parts of the universe we can’t see or easily detect.\n\nThe data spans the history of the universe:\n\nCo-author of the study Dr Eleonora Di Valentino, a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Sheffield, said: “The better we understand dark matter, the more insight we gain into how the Universe evolves and how its different components are connected.\n\n“Our results address a long-standing puzzle in cosmology. Measurements of the early Universe predict that cosmic structures should have grown more strongly over time than what we observe today.\n\n“However, observations of the modern Universe indicate that matter is slightly less clumped than expected, pointing to a mild mismatch between early- and late-time measurements.\n\n“This tension does not mean the standard cosmological model is wrong, but it may suggest that it is incomplete.\n\n“Our study shows that interactions between dark matter and neutrinos could help explain this difference, offering new insight into how structure formed in the Universe.\"\n\nThe findings set a clear path for further testing of the theory using more precise data from future telescopes, Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments and weak lensing surveys, which use the subtle distortions of light from distant galaxies to map the distribution of mass throughout the universe.\n\nDr William Giarè, co-author of the study and former Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Sheffield, now based at the University of Hawaiʻi, said: “If this interaction between dark matter and neutrinos is confirmed, it would be a fundamental breakthrough.\n\n“It would not only shed new light on a persistent mismatch between different cosmological probes, but also provide particle physicists with a concrete direction, indicating which properties to look for in laboratory experiments to help finally unmask the true nature of dark matter.”",

    "title": "47 Lessons",
    "description": "Things I've learned.",
    "fullText": "Every year, for my birthday, I collect my thoughts. This year I want to share some things I’ve learned: one lesson for each year I've been around. You might agree or disagree with them; maybe a bit of both. But they’re ideas I’ve picked up that, at the very least, are insights into how I think. Maybe they’ll be useful to you, too.\n\nPrevious birthday posts: 46 books, 45 wishes, 44 thoughts about the future, 43 things, 42 / 42 admissions, 41 things.\n\nEvery project, every major task, is worth taking your time over, both to plan and to do.\n\nMost food cooks better if you do it with care, treating the ingredients, your tools, and the people who will eat what you’re making with respect. Most projects come together better that way too.\n\nWhen I’ve rushed something together, I’ve almost always come to regret it.\n\nAiming for perfection is a trap.\n\nEven if you take things slowly, you’ll get stuff wrong. It’s part of doing anything meaningful. So rather than planning your project within an inch of its life, the best thing to do is start small, build in tests so you can figure out if you’re on the right track, learn from them, build incrementally, and keep going. The earlier you can get outside feedback, or some kind of signal from the outside world about whether you’re doing the right thing, the better.\n\nI have this slightly reductive metaphor I use for both writing code and English, and I think it probably works for any project of substance:\n\nThink of your project as a corridor. You have a bouncy ball and you need to get it to the end.\n\nYou could spend a long time trying to get a steady shot that hits the wall at the end of the corridor dead on. But you could also bounce the ball off the walls all the way down. It’s maybe less elegant, it’s maybe messier, but you still hit the wall at the end. And you probably get there a lot faster, with a lot less stress.\n\nAnother way to put it is this: if you accept that you’ll be wrong, you’ll approach your problem differently to how you would if you assumed you were right. You’ll talk to people earlier, you’ll get outside feedback, you’ll run tests. Even if you were right, those aren’t bad things to do. Conversely, if you assume you’re right, you probably won’t do anything to de-risk your idea, and you could still be wrong. And then you’ll have burned a bunch of time on something that doesn’t hit the mark, which might not have happened if you’d approached it with humility instead of hubris.\n\nLife is a project. You can assume you’ll do everything right or that you’re really smart, but that probably won’t get you very far. We all need feedback. We all need to learn and then course correct and then do it all over again. All we can do is iterate on ourselves.\n\nIt’s weird to me how many people don’t: they’ll try and give you directions even if they don’t know the way to a place, or they’ll spin their wheels forever instead of suffering the indignity of going out and asking someone.\n\nThe cool thing about admitting you don’t know, and just asking someone if you need to find something out, is that it leads to a different kind of conversation. If someone asks me something and I don’t know the answer, particularly if there’s a vulnerability to not having that particular piece of knowledge, telling them lets them know that I’ll be real with them. But more than that, it just gets me to where I need to be faster. I’m not wasting time on face-saving bullshit. And there’s precious little time to waste.\n\nYou are what you tolerate. But you are also what you notice, what you spend time with, and what you choose to dismiss.\n\nIf you allow your attention to be shaped and manipulated by someone else, you are what they are trying to make you to be.\n\nPay attention to your attention.\n\nI originally thought this famous advice was maybe unfair: didn’t it prioritize knee-jerk assessments? But it’s not about snap judgments; it’s not your first reaction to someone. It's about paying attention when someone actively reveals their values to you. If someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time. And I’ve come to understand that Maya Angelou is right.\n\nEven the smallest red flags matter. The person who tells you the world would be better if men and women played to their gender’s strengths. The person who, on being inconvenienced by local rail drivers striking for better pay, exclaims that they can’t wait until they’re all replaced by robots. The person who is needlessly rude to a waiter or the person behind the desk at a coat check. These are the kinds of small exchanges that are indicators of a mindset that dictates how they show up in the world. It might seem kind to overlook them, but it’s wiser not to. There’s always something more.\n\nWhat I mean by this is: if you allow something to continue, you help normalize it.\n\nPeople often say this about management: if you tolerate mediocre work, your team becomes mediocre. And, sure, that’s important in a work environment.\n\nBut it’s also true in life. If you allow someone to regularly belittle you, you become belittled. If you allow someone to cause harm, you cause harm.\n\nWhen my son was a baby, I quickly learned that while babies can’t talk through words, they have a full spectrum of communication that, generally speaking, gets their point across. I’d assumed that babies were a little bit like that old app Yo, where the only notification you could send or receive was a one-note “yo”. That was so far from being true.\n\nThere’s no such thing as a cry that doesn’t have an underlying meaning, from the practical — I’m hungry, I’m uncomfortable — to the existential — I’m lonely, I need a hug.\n\nWe learn words, we pick up the cultural dressing of the society around us, but we don’t stop crying. Those underlying signals perhaps become more complicated as we age, but they’re still there, all around us as subtext behind what everyone says and does. There are the words, and there’s the message behind the words.\n\nThere’s a thing I learned from Corey Ford, which I think may have been inspired by some of the work Carole Robin did on interpersonal relationships at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business.\n\nOpen, 360-degree feedback is vital on any high-performing team (or functional community). If you let friction between people linger, it tends to grow, and can sink the culture of a team; it’s the kind of thing that kills startups and leads to people leaving companies. You need to be able to bring things up and talk about it in a non-accusatory way.\n\nThat doesn’t come naturally. So you have to practice.\n\nHe’s got a great process that I’ve used for over a decade called the one-on-one gift exchange. The details of it aren’t important here, although it’s worth checking out. He advises that you do it on a regular schedule, whether you have something specific to bring up or not. In doing so, you make giving and receiving feedback just a thing that you do regularly, and it makes it easier to give the hard feedback when it inevitably comes up.\n\nAll communication is like this. You’ve got to practice. And you’ve got to keep practicing, otherwise your communication skills atrophy. And it turns out that open, honest, bidirectional communication is essential to every kind of relationship, from business to families to romantic to friendships. Otherwise things build up and build up, and, if you leave them unaddressed, they snap.\n\nI came from a context that didn’t matter: some guy writing code in Edinburgh, way outside of the centers of tech or media power. I got used to being critical about products and teams. Some of those criticisms were meaningful; some were not.\n\nThe first time this bit me was when I worked at Medium. At some company happy hour (there were a lot of those during the era I was there), I talked about how silly a very famous product design was. “I built that,” someone said. Over time, my voice became more influential, as I took bigger roles. Despite this increased attention, I sometimes continued to run my mouth over stuff that didn’t matter, offending people for no reason.\n\nSome things do matter. If you’re colluding with fascists, destroying the environment, or causing active, obvious harm, you deserve to be called out. On the other hand, a design decision or a voice that you don’t quite agree with deserves a little more care. Every single thing is made by real people with real lives and complicated contexts. There’s a difference between speaking truth to power and dunking on someone’s work. Choose your targets carefully.\n\nIf you’re not familiar with it, Plato’s allegory of the cave goes something like this:\n\nImagine prisoners who have spent their entire lives chained inside a cave facing a wall. Behind them is a fire; their captors cast shadows from various objects and puppets. Because those shadows are the only things they’ve ever known, they’re reality for the prisoners.\n\nImagine, then, that a prisoner is freed and compelled to leave. They see the fire; because they’ve never seen light so bright before, they’re temporarily blinded. Then they’re dragged outside and the sun is brighter still. Eventually, as their eyes adjust, the world outside is clearer and more detailed than the shadows ever were.\n\nSo the prisoner goes back into the cave to free the others. It’s dark in there, so they’re blinded again. The prisoners infer that whatever’s outside must have hurt the freed prisoner. So the freed prisoner must have been corrupted and whatever’s outside must be dangerous. They’ll defend themselves from being freed and dragged outside themselves, potentially to the death.\n\nHere’s where I’ve come to differ with the common understanding of the parable:\n\nEach of us is in our own cave. We don’t have a shared reality; we all get our own shadows.\n\nThe dangerous bit of the story isn’t being in the cave or being freed. It’s going back, or never having been a part of that particular cave to begin with and wandering in to provide perspective. There are so many people who believe their context is the right one, that the shadows they’re seeing aren’t just reality, but comfortable and right.\n\nTake it from a Third Culture Kid who’s moved around a bit.\n\nThe more caves you’ve seen and the more times you’ve been forced into the light by the gift — or shock — of another perspective, the clearer you can see the limits of any one view of the world. But that's scary as hell for the people who won't adjust themselves to the light, who want their version of the cave to be everybody's.\n\nIf you've only ever lived in one town, one state, or one country, you're seeing narrow shadows of how the world works. We all know the people in the cozy town who see the arrival of outsiders as a threat to their “way of life”. Geography, culture, and the assumptions of the people we connect with shape what seems natural, what seems possible, what seems inevitable, and it can make a new perspective — which, too often, is a new person — feel like a threat.\n\nOne of my favorite things is psychogeography: a way to explore built environments by taking arbitrary routes or following interpersonal, human-driven connections to places rather than taking a direct, logical route.\n\nIf you explore Venice, you’ll probably find the same tourist destinations as everybody else. That’s not nothing: they’re beautiful. But if you go and find, for example, the narrowest alleyway in Venice, you’ll leave the crowds, walk through neighborhoods where people actually live, and see more about the culture and nature of the city than if you’d stuck to the tour.\n\nI would have earned a lot more money if I’d dedicated myself to engineering and just focused on software and product inside the tech industry. But it would have been a hell of a lot less interesting, and a hell of a lot less fulfilling. Meandering means going somewhere new.\n\nI’ve found that the more someone adheres to a template for living, the more affronted they are by people who don’t adhere to one.\n\nThere’s a kind of xenophobia that’s at the root of conservatism. If you feel like being “normal” is a moral good, then it follows that someone who isn’t normal is immoral. They’re to be feared — and, potentially, converted.\n\nMost overtly, we see that in peoples’ reactions to trans people, to marriage equality, or to immigrants coming from other cultures or with minority skin colors. But it also manifests in smaller intolerances: the microaggressions that many people have to deal with every day. It’s not just MAGA; it’s the libertarian, predominantly male norms of the software industry, or New York City’s implicit dress codes.\n\nI’ve sometimes wondered if these templates provide some stability for people who struggle with empathy, who find it difficult to imagine another human being’s interior life. If you don’t know how other people work, established patterns can be reassuring. Conversely, people who don’t fit into them are unsettling.\n\nFor some reason, I give off a kind of conventional vibe, which means people feel safe sharing these fears with me. The British accent, “safe” haircut, and slightly self-deprecating demeanor don’t scream “part-Indonesian multinational third culture kid who cares about undermining centralized systems of power”. But that’s what I am.\n\nSo I’ve had those encounters. The guy who, over a drip coffee in San Mateo, told me that the problem with the world is that women don’t know their place anymore. The one who, at a pub in North Oxford, said that, you know, he doesn’t know what’s wrong with Europeans. The manager with the pristine haircut who complained that people who want inclusion “want so many other things”. And why doesn’t everyone speak English?\n\nSpoiler alert: I am not a safe person to have those conversations with.\n\nI tend to feel sorry for people who feel like they have to abide by a template, but that ebbs away as soon as they advocate for someone else’s subjugation. The templates defend themselves. But everyone deserves to live on their own terms.\n\nIt’s really easy to say things like, “I don’t do heights” or “I’m a bad public speaker” in the same register as “I can’t reach high shelves” or “I’m allergic to peanuts”. But they’re different kinds of things.\n\nThe first are surmountable. You might not be a good public speaker now, but most great public speakers had practice. The question isn’t, “can you be a good public speaker”, but “do you want to be?” Because if you do, and you put your mind to it, you probably can.\n\nI started out by wanting to write for a career. I’ve been a software engineer. I’ve founded two startups. I was a venture capitalist, somehow. I was also a film reviewer and a barista. I’ve sworn blind that I couldn’t draw and have also drawn well. Everyone changes. We’re all in flux. We can all grow.\n\nThat’s true for industries and countries. We can wax nostalgic all we want about how it used to be, but (1) it probably never actually was exactly as we remember, (2) we can never go back there. Time doesn’t work that way. Even if we had a fully-kitted-out Delorean with a functional flux capacitor, our presence would change that reality. It cannot exist.\n\nI sometimes find myself nurturing a kind of homesickness for different eras of my life. Some of them make me so sad that my chest aches. I miss people, I miss places, I miss the rhythms and values of my life back then. But I can’t go back. There’s no email I can send, no journey I can take, that will return me there. It’s more important to figure out what was so special about them, understand how important those values are to me, and make decisions about my future with them in mind.\n\nAnd so much else. Rather than worrying about how the news industry used to be, we need to invent how it will be in the future. Instead of yearning for the glory days of the open web, we need to build something new. Instead of wistfully dreaming about a time before Donald Trump, we must prepare for the time after him. We all have to move forwards.\n\nOf course, then you’ve got another problem.\n\nMost of the time, our work is in the hands of the right people. We make good decisions hiring, we bring new people we trust into our communities, and everything works well.\n\nBut sometimes that doesn’t happen. Maybe someone’s had a bad day, or they’re sick, or someone who doesn’t understand the context has to fill in for some other reason. Suddenly it becomes apparent that we don’t have systems of control: the most sensitive tasks don’t have safeguards that ensure the right thing happens. Our process has been based on norms and traditions rather than enforced checks.\n\nThese days, modern code is written using the Pull Request, a feature that was streamlined and therefore popularized by GitHub. Instead of an engineer just writing software into the codebase, they submit it as a change; another engineer checks it over and either requests changes or gives it the okay. Usually, an automated system also runs tests against it to make sure the code fits into the standards and guidelines of the codebase. The result is a system of control that has at least two levels of check: the human reviewer and the automated tests. Damaging mistakes can still happen, but far fewer than if you were writing code without oversight and uploading it directly to a production server.\n\nWriting a rule, law, or process to contain a system of control isn’t a vote against the trustworthiness of whoever is responsible when it’s written. It’s a way of ensuring that whoever the next person is can’t abuse it.\n\nThere’s a lot that I could say about the second Trump administration. One way of looking at it is as a penetration test for American democracy: finding the parts of the American system of government that were held together with norms and traditions instead of well-defined systems of control.\n\nThat’s been the worst-case scenario. But the effect of every bad manager, every disgruntled employee, and every bad actor, big and small, can be mitigated by the same principle.\n\nIt stands to reason. A brand is a business entity’s marketing identity, which inherently is designed to manipulate you into having a reaction to it. Why would you trust that?\n\nOne of the remarkable things I’ve observed in journalism is that a lot of people in the industry assume that the general public should love them. Journalism provides a lot of societal value, so the fact that trust in it is at an all-time low means the public needs to be educated about it. The reason they don’t trust it is they don’t know enough about it!\n\nI want to play the Family Feud buzzer sound here. Ehhh ehhh. The reason people don’t trust journalism is that it’s talking past them, not to them, and it’s certainly not listening to them. They see the logos and the wordmarks, rather than a real human being taking the time to be real with them. The lesson of young people turning to YouTube and TikTok is not that young people love vertical streaming video, it’s that they’re tired of corporate bullshit and want to see a real human face meeting them where they’re at.\n\nIt’s a scary prospect for a newsroom, or for any organization. A brand is an identity for the full collection of people. In contrast, a real human face is someone who might not always be employed at that company. If a community has built up a relationship with a person, they may leave when the person finds a new job. The brand owners want to invest in relationships they can keep for themselves.\n\nBut the public doesn’t care about that. They just want to have an actual conversation with a person. They’re looking for human authenticity and a personality that doesn’t try to authoritatively dictate the truth to them.\n\nWe all just want to connect with people, not be marketed at. It’s about relationships and humanity. Community doesn’t care about your ligatures. It wants to be seen.\n\nIf only managers receive public gratitude from leadership for a team’s accomplishments, then the culture prioritizes hierarchy and devalues the contributions of the individual contributors who actually do the work.\n\nIf only certain roles receive gratitude from leadership, then the culture only really values those roles, and sees other positions as subordinate.\n\nOver time, if people are doing hard but thankless work, they’re unlikely to stick around, and the work will suffer.\n\nEveryone who shows up to work is making a contribution. What you’re doing couldn’t happen without them. They’re three-dimensional people who care about their place in the community and want to be respected. So treat them like they are — and thank them.\n\nIf you’re on a team that writes code, every codebase you write from scratch is something new that you have to maintain. Write enough of those without increasing the size of the team and you’ll find that everybody is in maintenance mode all of the time. (Self-hosting someone else’s code has a similar maintenance overhead.)\n\nIf you’re in a company that buys services, every new service you buy is something new that you have to pay for. \n\nIf you add complications to your life, the emotional and administrative overhead adds up in similar ways. You might think you can take it on, and you probably can, but as the complications and responsibilities grow, so does the overhead of living. And suddenly you might find that you’re tired and stressed all the time. The trick is, it sometimes happens without you really meaning it to. Life accumulates.\n\nThe trick is knowing which kinds of overheads you can manage, and when.\n\nI’ve written a lot over the years about how if you’re making a product, you need to know who it’s for, and make sure it actually solves someone’s problem. “Scratching your own itch” is something that open source developers in particular do a lot of, but if you do that, you may spend a long time, and potentially a lot of money, working on something and find out at the end that it doesn’t quite solve a problem for anyone but you.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean that there’s anything wrong with scratching your own itch.\n\nI think it’s the wrong way to go about starting a business (be it a startup, small business, or non-profit). In those situations, you need to know who your customers are, you do need to understand if what you’re making is useful, and you do need to understand if anyone will buy or support what you’re building in the context of the model you’ve created for it.\n\nBut not everything has to be a business. Not everything has to be sustainable.\n\nThere’s a word for a creative act that is self-led in this way, regardless of whether the medium is code or words or paint or anything else: art. It’s always okay to make art. We need more art, all the time. Art is one of the core things that makes us human; it’s one of the core substrates that holds society together.\n\nBut you’ve got to know whether you’re making art or building a business: whether your center of gravity, your great adjudicator, is your customers or your heart. By understanding this, you’ve set up your own expectations, and you know which tools to deploy. With art, you can follow your heart more ambitiously. With customers, you can obsessively serve them. In both cases, you can cut the ambiguity.\n\nIt’s not that one is more valuable than the other. They’re just different things.\n\nBack when I worked for Matter Ventures, we would have intense recruitment periods for our accelerator. For a few weeks, I’d work twelve hour days, sitting on a hard wooden stool at a homemade wooden table made out of a door, and listen to pitches from early-stage startups that hoped to obtain our funding. It ran the gamut from incredibly smart applications that I’d never seen before, through barely-there ventures fueled by magical thinking, to outright grifts.\n\nA lot of first-time entrepreneurs were adamant that we should fund them because of their values. They were good people doing something ideologically wonderful in the world. They saw our investment like a magical grant.\n\nBut it wasn’t a grant. We were a mission-driven accelerator, investing in ventures with the potential to help create a more informed, empathetic, and inclusive society. But we were still a for-profit venture firm. We needed to invest in startups that had the potential to provide an exponential financial return. There were plenty of lovely people whose projects had lots of value — but we couldn’t fund them using our model.\n\nWhen I was building Known, we couldn’t get investors to the point where they had conviction we would give them that return. They were very nice to us, and we had some good coffee conversations - but that’s where it ended. We couldn’t tell that story. The best founders pivot their startups until they’ve caught onto something that looks like it will grow quickly. That requires killing your darlings, as writers call it; letting go of the things you love that just aren’t working. That’s not what we chose to do.\n\nEvery venture fund is working for their limited partners (the people who put money into them). That’s most likely to be a financial return — ideally a startup will return a substantial multiple of the money that was invested into it — but it might also be a strategic return. (Consider why NVIDIA might invest in AI startups, or why the CIA might invest in social media - which, by the way, is a thing they do.) Every limited partner has a different agenda; every venture firm has its own investment hypothesis.\n\nThe same is true of non-profit grants, as it happens: donors put money into them, too, and they also have their own agendas.\n\nIf you’re not raising money with the needs of the venture partners / non-profit funders and the agendas of the limited partners or donors in mind, you’re not taking it seriously. It’s not magic. It’s a financial transaction. You don’t get it because you deserve it; you get it because the funder thinks you’ll give them the return they need.\n\nAnd of course, this is how power centralizes.\n\nNine times out of ten, it’ll fix your computer problem. Really. Try it before you ask someone else. I’m begging you.\n\nYou need sleep. You really do. You only think you don’t because you don’t physically drop dead or stop talking when you’re underslept. But you’re basically another person. Go to bed.\n\nI’m not sure where it came from, but over time I developed a kind of shame just for being me: an underlying sense that there was something fundamentally wrong with me, but nobody would tell me what it was. It arrived one day when I was a teenager and never left. I imagined that there was a magic incantation that I didn’t know, but I could never be good enough. I’d never be worthy of the adulation I placed in other people; if I wanted to be liked, I needed to mask to be more like them. I desperately wanted someone to really see me and — despite that — know that I was okay.\n\nThe thing about feeling like you just need an ally, or someone who will tell you at last that you’re okay, is that it puts you in an incredibly vulnerable position. You don’t need someone who will tell you you’re okay; you don’t need a superficial ally. You need people who you can be in community with, who you can build relationships with over your life.\n\nIt creates vulnerability in another way, too. If you don’t like yourself, if you feel like you don’t matter, you can trick yourself into thinking that nothing you do matters, either. And there probably are people who care a great deal about you; consequently, what you do does matter. So you can make decisions that inadvertently hurt people you care about a great deal. You can fail to fight for relationships that have the potential to transform the entire fabric of your life. You can be passive about the stuff that really matters in life. You can find yourself in a place where you ignore your goals, values, and ideals.\n\nSo I’ve learned that you need to find ways to feel good about yourself; to respect yourself; to care for yourself. It’s not a selfish act. It allows you to show up in the way the people you care about need you to, which in turn allows you to build better relationships, better community with them. It allows you to take bets on yourself and build the life you really want to live. It allows you to be you, on a really fundamental level.\n\nBut if you don’t do that? The spiral is hard to escape from. The people you care about will tire of your disrespect. And those relationships may take years to repair.\n\nYes, my metabolism is slower than it ever used to be. I’m definitely more tired. My back is a little more tense. I find it harder to shift into a creative mode.\n\nBut let’s look at how my life has changed. I have a much more demanding job and my time is less my own.\n\nIn my twenties I was the founder of a bootstrapped startup and could set my own parameters, including when I worked and when I didn’t. Nobody was checking my work except our customers: I had remarkable creative freedom. I didn’t have a kid, so I could walk seven or eight miles a day (and did). I hung out with friends more often, saw live music more often, went to the movies, and spent more of my life being active and having fun as a percentage.\n\nI’m pretty sure that if I returned to that level of activity, my metabolism would increase. If I made more of a commitment to fun and had fewer parameters in my work, I would find it easier to shift into a creative flow state. If I was less stressed about money, I would sleep better at night. In fact, before my mother died, I was running 5K every day, and my body, my mind, and my soul, frankly, were all improving.\n\nLet’s be clear: every body is different. Biology is real. But not every mid-life physical decline is inevitable. It’s that the demands on your time, your energy, your brain increase. There’s more overhead. And it takes a toll.\n\nFor a long time after she died, I could hear the gentle click of my mother breathing through her cannulas. It followed me home to her house in Santa Rosa, and across coasts to my new home in Elkins Park. Sometimes I could hear the wheels of her feeding tube stand rolling across the floor.\n\nThese sounds lived in me. I couldn’t let them go. Not with all they represented.\n\nWe washed her, my sister and I, right at the end. A final act of care. But not one of goodbye.\n\nMy cousin warned me that the grief could sneak up and grab you, unsuspecting, and it did: I found that I had to pull off the road or hide myself in a public bathroom and let it out. I don’t know what other people made of the sound of my sobbing, if they heard it. It didn’t matter.\n\nIt had been a long journey. I’ve written about it from time to time, partially to explain myself, and partially to exorcise it. It doesn’t represent my mother, and shouldn’t, except in that she fought with so much life-force, and maintained so much good humor and kindness until the very end. I want to remember her smiling at a joke or angry about the world, not her prone fragility in a hospital bed.\n\nGrief is just this: the loss of her, the loss of the family with her in it, the loss of her life and our lives and how everything was before we knew she was going to die. Some days, moving forwards is easy. Some days, the sadness ambushes you, and it’s all you can do to keep breathing. Every day, I feel it in my limbs, in a new heaviness to every day. If you cut me open like a tree I’m sure you’ll see it in my rings.\n\nGrief is not the same thing as trauma.\n\nThe trauma is of seeing my mother in that bed, knowing she didn’t want to die in a hospital after that decade-long struggle, and not being able to do anything about it because the doctors she needed 20 liters of oxygen and she would have suffocated if we’d moved her.\n\nIt’s of learning what palliative care means, first-hand, and understanding that they would pump her with drugs and starve her until the end came.\n\nIt’s of seeing her at the bottom of the stairs and staying with her until the ambulance came.\n\nIt’s of yelling at her to wake up after the surgeon scraped off the crust around her lungs, her lips blue, her breathing shallow, and thinking this was really the end this time.\n\nIt’s of moving thousands of miles to be with her, sure she was about to die, sure that I would get the same sickness, and losing the person I thought I would spend my life with, not knowing if I had time left.\n\nIt’s of my cousins, and my aunt, and my Grandma. Everyone we have lost to this horrible disease.\n\nIt’s of, even now, not being able to dream about my mother, not hearing her voice except for the videos I took of her, except for that one time I heard her say, “oh my God, you guys,” clear as day in the dead of night.\n\nIt’s layered like rock, a thick crust of fight or flight burying layers of sadness and images that make me sit upright with my heart pounding.\n\nI’ve only recently made peace with disrupting those layers and mining to its core. Losing the trauma is not the same thing as losing her. It’s not saying that she doesn’t matter; it’s not saying that any of the people we’ve lost don’t matter. Quite the opposite. It just says, it’s time to keep living. For them and for me.\n\nOversharing is real. Sometimes it can be too much. If you’ve found you’ve done that, you might need to retreat for a moment or two; reassure the person you’re talking to that everything is okay. That you’re normal, you know? You can follow the template too. You’re safe.\n\nNot forever. Just for a beat. Masking is overhead, after all.\n\nYou know those little white cups from In-N-Out? You pull on their edges and they unfold and unfold. They’re surprisingly large! So much room for ketchup! Do you need that much ketchup? Maybe!\n\n(You know about the secret menu, right?)\n\nI stood in Doctors, a real ale pub in Edinburgh that was never my favorite but was a short walk from the university buildings. I’d just presented at a tech meetup at the Appleton Tower, explaining to folks what Known did and why I thought the indieweb was important. I’d been back for a few days; I just planned to be in Edinburgh for a week.\n\nSomeone who I’d known for years — not well, just an acquaintance, but someone who I thought was generally smart and knew what they were talking about, more or less — was saying that she didn’t know why I’d left. “When they moved to California, they left you,” she said. “I would have said, ‘sorry, Mum, it’s your own fault.’”\n\nI’ve played that conversation back in my head for years. At the time, I was so stunned that I didn’t have a real response. It was so far outside of my spectrum of values that I didn’t see it coming. Why would you say that to someone who had ripped their whole life up to be closer to their terminally ill mother? Why would you even think it?\n\nI did do those things. When I was thirty-two years old, I moved to California for what I thought was a temporary visit. I ripped my life apart in the process.\n\nWhen I was twenty-three years old, nine years earlier, my parents moved to California to be closer to my Oma. It seemed like a no-brainer. Of course you’ll be there for your family. We’re close. We love each other. We’ll support each other.\n\nMy move was a decision point: I didn’t know, exactly, where my life in Edinburgh was going. It could have gone to amazing places — and it also might not have. I knew that if I had chosen not to be with my mother during her illness, I would probably have regretted it. It was going to be seismic, but I needed to go.\n\nBut that person’s voice. I do think about it. If I’m honest with myself, it dovetails with my own middle-of-the-night anxieties. Should I have stayed?\n\nI lost the person I was with at the time, who I hoped I’d spend my life with. That loss was devastating; the move itself was devastating. I loved my old life. But in comparison to not being there when Ma was struggling?\n\nSo, no. I did the right thing, even if I suffered a loss in the process. I’m grateful I was able to spend that time with my family. I was able to take Ma for walks and sit around the dining room table and give her hugs at the end of the day and help her brush her teeth when she was too weak to get out of bed. I was there. I am glad I was there.\n\nIf you arrange your parenting for your convenience rather than their well-being, they’ll feel it.\n\nFor example, I’ve found that if I get up as soon as he falls asleep, and he wakes up twenty minutes later to find himself in a dark room by himself, he’s scared in the moment, but trust has been eroded over time. Yes, eventually he needs to sleep by himself, but also, he’s three years old. There’s time. And I did it enough times that he now asks me, plaintively: “do you promise you’ll stay with me?” The first time he asked broke my heart.\n\nI used to love traveling for work: when I was based in the Bay Area I’d go to New York City for long trips and love exploring in the cracks between commitments. I’d walk across the Brooklyn Bridge and find little shops in small corners; psychogeography the shit out of that place. And there would be all kinds of conversations I’d get to have as a result: meeting people for a coffee here, for a beer there.\n\nBut now I have a little guy who doesn’t understand why I’m going away, and who misses his daddy. It makes him nervous. He doesn’t FaceTime for long, but I’ve been told he’s obviously depressed when I’m not around. I still love traveling, and as he gets older I’ll find ways to bring him with me. But until then, I need to minimize the trips. I need to stay in bed and give him a hug. I need to spend the time.\n\nWhen you set up high expectations and rigid rules, you’re not creating the conditions for a child to grow up into their own person. You’re effectively setting up a template and punishing them when they meander from it. Worse, you’re taking a still-developing human, who doesn’t understand their own emotions yet and hasn’t developed strong communication skills, and you’re ignoring the underlying needs and feelings that form the subtext of their behaviors. In a real way, you’re ignoring their humanity.\n\nHaving a child has taught me to look for the signs of sadness, of quiet worries, of not feeling well behind what a strict parent might call “acting out”. Every time he throws something or ignores something I ask him to do, if I remember to pause and really ask him about it, I’ll find that there’s something he isn’t saying — or at least, not saying with words. We can usually have a good conversation about it, and then a hug. It builds trust. He knows I’m looking out for him. I see him.\n\nAnd then, of course, there’s the parents who hit their children. That’s the version that’s unambiguous abuse. It’s a caveman approach to nurturing a human being that I think says a lot more about the emotional intelligence and capabilities of the parent than it does the child. They’ll often justify it in weird ways, by saying things like, “I was smacked and it never hurt me.” There often seems to be a kind of defiance to it. But guess what? Not being smacked would have hurt you less. I bet pausing for a beat and digging into how they feel would be revealing, too.\n\nParenting is hard. It can try your patience. But I can’t imagine hitting my child and wanting him to be anything less than his own person, free from everybody’s templates and expectations. Part of keeping him safe is keeping him safe from anyone who would seek to subjugate his spirit. And if anyone ever tries to hit my kid, I’m calling the police.\n\nWhen I’m stressed, or feeling under the weather, or having trouble thinking my way around a problem, I’ve found that going for a walk is the best thing I can possibly do. It takes me out of my context, it allows me to blow off steam, and it puts me in a relatively isolated state where I have fewer distractions or inputs. It’s its own form of attention, in a way; its own way of being in the world.\n\nIt’s also really good exercise, particularly if you do it briskly: a 15 or 16 minute mile is a decent walking pace. As a bonus, it’s even better for blowing off steam at that speed.\n\nMy opinion: if you don’t live somewhere where you can walk outside easily, move.\n\nMy trauma therapist and I have a shorthand: she tells me to get that milkshake.\n\nWhat it means is this: sometimes it’s important to go do something nice for yourself. You don’t need to ask permission; you can just do it.\n\nLife can be a lot. And I happen to like milkshakes. So sometimes, quietly, when I need a treat, I go and get one, guilt-free.\n\nI think they have a lot more going on than they let on, is all I’m saying.\n\nDon’t believe me? Talk to one. It’ll listen.\n\nThere used to be a cow field between my home and the center of town. I’d walk through it twice a day, stepping over the cattlegrid and dodging the cyclists who zoomed past. The cows were curious and friendly; they would come and investigate what you were up to.\n\nThere was another field that lay far below the Marston Ferry Road, back in Oxford, where I grew up. You could stand against the fence at the road and the cows would look up to see you. If you stayed there for long enough, they would congregate around you, as if you were the Pope. Perhaps they were hoping I’d feed them. I’d like to think they thought I might have something to say.\n\nI’ve made two major moves in my adult life: once to California, and once, after my mother died, away from California, to the area outside of Philadelphia. It was lonely.\n\nTo have a friendship — a real one, not a warmed-up acquaintanceship — is to have built a non-romantic relationship where you really see each other. Neither wants anything from the other; there are no romantic or sexual expectations, or really expectations of any kind except that you’ll be there. It’s a relationship of shared support, values, and community.\n\nWithout it, you wither. People who don’t have friends die earlier. And while the internet can help you keep in touch with people you have moved away from, there’s no real alternative to having that mutual support there, with you, in the flesh.\n\nBut everybody moves. It’s not realistic to stay in the same place your whole life. People get jobs, family members get sick, people get priced out of their communities, there’s a Brexit. All kinds of things happen. So staying in one place is not a foolproof solution.\n\nThe thing, then, is to look for new places with community in mind. Where are you going to find like-minded people? Who are the people who see you now, and what kinds of places do they hang out in? Where are the comparable places in your new geography? Where are your people?\n\nFor me, that means finding the bookstores; the community spaces; the outsider arts events; the live music and the weird between-the-cracks culture. Find the people who don’t want to live to someone else’s template but do want to be kind. That’s where the good stuff is.\n\nAnd given the choice between choosing a beautiful house in the middle nowhere and a lackluster apartment in a place where you have community, I’d pick the place with community. It’s going to make your life better. It’s going to make everything better. Community cuts to the core of what life is; a house is just a house.\n\nMy Oma taught me to cook. She loved to make food; often she’d be thinking about the evening meal throughout the entire day, regardless of whatever else was going on. In her nineties, she moved in with my parents, and although her love of cooking hadn’t diminished, her ability to stand over a stove had. So I helped her.\n\nShe was part-Indonesian, so the first dishes I put together started with spice mixes of turmeric, coriander, ginger, garlic, onion, and chillies. Indonesians call this the bumbu: a spice paste that can form the basis of many dishes.\n\nYou’re meant to make them with shallots, not onions. There’s supposed to be galangal rather than ginger; candlenuts are common. But those things weren’t easy to get in the San Joaquin Valley back then, so she made do. Sometimes she used milk instead of coconut milk; sometimes she couldn’t find ketcap manis. And it was always fantastic anyway.\n\nYou can improvise. You can use available ingredients. You can work with what you have and make the result your own, instead of trying for an unchanging perfect ideal. That’s how culture changes and ebbs and flows. I still make Indonesian meals, but they’re different to how my Oma did it, and the way I teach my son will be slightly different to how I learned. And so it goes, forever.\n\nThe important thing was the making and the eating, the gift of food and the sharing of it, not the verbatim copying of a version of a dish. There’s skill and craftsmanship in doing that, but that’s not where the life is.\n\nOne was made with love, which still shines through the recipe; by following the same path, even if you substitute some ingredients you’re making it with love again. The other is just a product. The ingredients have changed over time; the portions are slightly different for business reasons; it’s missing the context and the smells. It’s generally better to let those memories sit.\n\nAnd post about it on the internet. Then, if something happens, people can point at your post, nod to themselves sagely, and say, “he died as he lived.”\n\nI like the OK Go cover, for what it’s worth.\n\nI remember taking my high school exams in the gym, individual chairs placed in rows atop wooden floors that smelled faintly of feet. You could hear breathing; the occasional cough; the squeak of rubber on hardwood as the invigilator roamed the aisles.\n\nShowing your working was vital. Your answer to a math question could ultimately be wrong, but if your thinking was along the right lines, you’d pick up some points. They didn’t want to teach us by rote; they wanted to teach us how to navigate problems.\n\nAll of my best professional experiences have been derived from showing my working. When I started Elgg, every success was because we blogged how we were thinking about it; before we’d written a single line of code, before we knew we’d write any code, we’d talked about why it was important. People were attracted to the product, sure, but more than that, they were attracted to the ideas behind the project. And when we were wrong, they let us know — kindly. It helped us learn and grow.\n\nThat principle has continued to this day: to, in fact, you reading these words right now. Every time I share how I think, I make connections that I might not have otherwise. It’s helped me build community, land jobs I never would have landed, and find myself in rooms that would otherwise have been closed off to me.\n\nThe more you share of who you are, how you think, what you care about, and what your skills are, the easier it is for other people to find you, and for you to build connections and relationships. That doesn’t mean put yourself at risk: I’m not about to publish my home address here or reveal precise details about my kid. But there’s a lot you can say about yourself if you work in the open.\n\nIn the early 2000s, a bunch of early web users, including me, wanted to tear down traditional gatekeepers: publishers who dictated whose voices could and couldn’t be heard, politicians who didn’t listen inclusively to communities, the traditional structures of power that maintained their own dominance, only including people who didn’t come from those hierarchies if they were deemed to be useful or compliant. So much of the early web movement was about creating a more participative world.\n\nAnd then it turned out that some of those people saw an opportunity to insert themselves as gatekeepers. People like Mark Zuckerberg created vast companies that, in time, came to intermediate and charge rent for more than those old gatekeepers ever had. They sought to own aspects of our lives, like talking to our friends, that previously had been free from intermediation. The way for their companies to grow was to encroach upon the cultural commons. The gates they built became more and more powerful over time. As they calcified, some of them became templates that came to govern the rhythms and tenor of everybody’s lives.\n\nSome did not. Others built the indieweb, and the free software movement, and found ways to undermine the control of these new gatekeepers. They stayed true to the values of the movement.\n\nI tried to be one of them. Early in my career, I saw that ed-tech companies were milking giant contracts from tax-funded universities, while delivering software that didn’t do much to help people learn. Elgg was a direct response to this; it was fueled by a deep anger at the people who would seek to strip-mine a public good. Known, my second open source platform, was aimed directly at people like Zuckerberg. They were both attempts to undermine centralized wealth and power. That’s what drove me, and I have no regrets.\n\nI have learned to look for the people who tear down gates for good, who try and foster new co-operative, participative movements in their place. They’re always there, even if they are not the most prominent voices in the room. And together, there’s a lot we can still do to make the world better.\n\nSomeone joining the movement for the wrong reasons doesn’t invalidate the movement. It just makes the work even more important.\n\nYeah, sure, read the “good” stuff. I love literary fiction. The Color Purple is my idea of a perfect novel. I just finished I Who Have Never Known Men, which is an astonishing novel that plumbs the depths of what it means to be human, written with poetry.\n\nBut you can read whatever you want. All inputs are worthwhile. Pulpy airport thrillers have brought me through some hard times. Fan fiction has struck a nerve that I never knew existed. Some of the most well-crafted writing I’ve ever read was published on a style-free website, tumbling onto the page in 12-point Times New Roman. It’s all good. All of it.\n\nIf you want to write, the only imperative is to read.\n\nThat’s certainly true for my long-form writing, and that might be advice you’ve read before. But it’s true for my short-form writing, too. If I haven’t dug into a book lately, my blogging suffers. Even my writing at work — emails and process documentation are hardly the bastion of literary prowess at the best of times — is less inspired.\n\n“There are other fish in the sea,” the aphorism goes. But when you’re in a relationship where things aren’t going perfectly, I think it’s better to assume there aren’t.\n\nI don’t mean that you should stay in an abusive or untenable situation. If you are being harmed and there’s no chance of living in harmony, then, absolutely, you need to get out of there. But if it’s just not quite right, or if circumstances have become obstacles, I think there’s a lot to be gained by fighting for it. At least until you’ve determined that there’s no possible way forward.\n\nThis is where, in my life, not showing up for myself has sometimes allowed me to fall into a defeatism that has caused me to give up early. “Of course this won’t work,” I think to myself. I’m the through line to the failure. I shouldn’t assume that someone would want to be with me. They’ll be better off without me.\n\nThe result is giving up on people who really care and situations that could last a lifetime. It’s not a given; nothing is. But there’s a real scarcity to people that are really compatible with you. (Or, I should say, there’s a real scarcity to people that are really compatible with me.) So, while it’s worked out for me in the end, I have sometimes wished I would have fought harder, and not assumed that eventually everyone will want someone better.\n\nI don’t think you can show up well in a relationship without assuming it’s the only relationship on earth that will ever be important to you. It’s got to have fire. It’s got to have stakes.\n\nAnd if you give up without fighting for it, it doesn’t.\n\nQ: Why did Pierre-Joseph Proudhon only drink camomile tea?<br>\nA: Because all proper tea is theft.\n\nA single person holds many conflicting identities, roles, beliefs, and experiences; our selves are complex and ever-changing. There is no singular, static definition that we can use to capture any person.\n\nWe’re not making art or building a business, because there’s no way to separate the self cleanly into those categories. We’re not our professional titles and our personal contexts, because those things are inseparable. We have no way of surgically extracting pieces of ourselves, or freezing them and framing them, unchanged. We’re always learning, always growing, always making connections between the things we know, the things we’ve felt, our flaws, our traumas, our successes, our pride, the things we’ve done and haven’t done. In everything we do and everywhere we are, we are all of ourselves.\n\nWhen we build walls, we build overhead, and we keep building overhead until it’s impossible to maintain and it all comes tumbling down. A single cave’s shadows can’t capture a whole person.\n\nBetter, then, to understand that we are our whole selves, and to respect that in ourselves and in the people around us. We are smart and brave and silly and stupid. We are strategic and impulsive. We must be allies for each other. In a world where we are asked to refine ourselves down into digestible metadata for the benefit of machines and algorithms, we must celebrate our full humanity.\n\nBring your full self to work. Bring your full self home. Only when we’re allowed to be intact, with a community built on mutual sight and support, can we live sustainably: our overheads manageable, our wounds tended to, our victories celebrated.\n\nAnd we all deserve to live sustainably. We all deserve to be supported. We all deserve to be well. We all deserve to live with our full, changing, contradictory identities out in the open, unmasked.",

    "description": "\"In fact, at first I was skeptical about the signal as it was too strong to be real.\"",
    "fullText": "While peering into some of the oldest regions of the known universe — dating back to just 1.4 billion years after the Big Bang — an international team of astronomers made a puzzling discovery.\n\nAs detailed in a paper published the journal Nature, they discovered an extremely hot galaxy cluster that’s far hotter and older than current theories allow.\n\nIn other words, the discovered cluster is, under our current best understanding of cosmology, impossible — which could upend our current understanding of how the early universe evolved.\n\n“We didn’t expect to see such a hot cluster atmosphere so early in cosmic history,” said lead author and University of British Columbia PhD candidate Dazhi Zhou in a statement about the finding.\n\n“In fact, at first I was skeptical about the signal as it was too strong to be real,” he added. “But after months of verification, we’ve confirmed this gas is at least five times hotter than predicted, and even hotter and more energetic than what we find in many present-day clusters.”\n\nThe astronomers’ best theory is that the cluster somehow got a massive head start — previously unimaginable even to top thinkers — thanks to black holes lurking at its core.\n\n“This tells us that something in the early universe, likely three recently discovered supermassive black holes in the cluster, were already pumping huge amounts of energy into the surroundings and shaping the young cluster,” added coauthor and Dalhousie University professor Scott Chapman, “much earlier and more strongly than we thought.”\n\nConventional theories suggest that galaxy clusters gain energy as the gases inside are pulled together and squeezed due to intensifying gravitational forces. The latest research, however, suggests there’s more to how these clusters evolve — perhaps even a separate source beyond these gravitational forces.\n\nThe team found the strange readings when they analyzed observations by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the Atacama desert in Chile that examined a “baby” galaxy cluster called SPT2349-56.\n\nThe cluster, which dates back to around 12 billion years, is huge: its core alone measures around half a million light-years across. That’s roughly the size of the halo that circles our own Milky Way galaxy, a vast region that contains globular clusters and older stars — yet it spawns stars more than 5,000 times faster.\n\nThe astronomers are hoping to figure out what allowed it to get so incredibly hot, a source of energy that defies our current models. The research suggests galaxy clusters evolve in a far more explosive manner than previously thought, aided by gravitational interactions between multiple supermassive black holes.\n\n“We want to figure out how the intense star formation, the active black holes and this overheated atmosphere interact, and what it tells us about how present galaxy clusters were built,” Zhou explained in the statement. “How can all of this be happening at once in such a young, compact system?”\n\n“Understanding galaxy clusters is the key to understanding the biggest galaxies in the universe,” Chapman said. “These massive galaxies mostly reside in clusters, and their evolution is heavily shaped by the very strong environment of the clusters as they form, including the intracluster medium.”\n\nMore on galaxy clusters: Scientists Intrigued by Bridge of Dark Matter Inside Huge Galaxy Cluster",

    "fullText": "A preschool teacher was arrested on camera as soon as she finished a TV interview criticizing Donald Trump, fueling the debate over protest policing and free speech.\n\nJessica Plichta, 22, said she was the only person arrested among roughly 200 demonstrators at an anti-war protest in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Saturday, hours after Nicolas Maduro was detained in Caracas by the U.S. military.\n\nIn the broadcast footage, two officers could be seen approaching from behind as she wrapped her interview with WZZM, the city’s ABC affiliate, then escorted her away as she told them, “I am not resisting arrest.”\n\nWZZM said an officer cited “obstructing a roadway and failure to obey a lawful command,” and that Plichta had been charged with failure to obey a lawful command.\n\nPlichta later told Zeteo: “I don’t think it’s a coincidence that as soon as I finished an interview speaking on Venezuela, I was arrested.”\n\nShe told the outlet the officers shoved her into the back of a patrol car without fastening her seat belt, then drove a short distance down the street—out of view of cameras and bystanders.\n\nAccording to Plichta, they stopped again, pulled her out, bent her over the vehicle, patted her down, and took her belongings. She recalled one officer saying they moved her because she was “making a scene.”\n\nShe also said officers repeatedly pressed her on whether she was Venezuelan, what her connection to Venezuela was, and why she had attended the protest. Plichta claimed they tried to get her to identify other demonstrators.\n\n“We are so accustomed to, and used to, repression when we speak out on anti-war topics. When we speak out for Venezuela, when we speak out for Palestine, we expect the police to want to shut that down,” she told Zeteo.\n\n“It just shows how much they feel they can get away with things, how easy it is for them to isolate people from the public eye when they’re doing this.”\n\nPlichta said she largely stayed quiet as officers took her to jail, where she said the same questions continued. She was released about three hours later after other protesters gathered to demand she be freed and was seen punching the air in a video shared on Facebook.\n\nThe Grand Rapids Police Department disputed her claims in a statement to the Daily Beast.\n\nA spokesperson said more than “25 announcements were made from the PA system of a marked police cruiser for the group [of protesters] to leave the roadway and relocate their activities to the sidewalk,” but that they had “refused lawful orders” to move to the sidewalk and “began blocking intersections.”\n\nAdding that supervisors told officers they could arrest anyone who could be “positively identified,” the spokesperson confirmed only one arrest was made. The Beast followed up to ask why only Plichta had been arrested, but had not received a response at the time of publication.\n\nThe mayor of Grand Rapids is David LaGrand, a Democrat.\n\nThe incident came to light as Trump, 79, tries to sell the Maduro operation at home, despite signs of public unease.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released Monday found about one in three Americans approve of the U.S. strike, while 72 percent worry the U.S. will become too involved.\n\nIt is also a small part of a much larger information war that has even seen Trump amplify mislabeled footage on Truth Social to claim mass celebrations after the Maduro capture—a video that fact-checkers traced to an unrelated 2024 protest.",

Residents dealing with chronic flooding need climate resilience in their communities. The neighborhood is under threat of sinking as the bay continues to rise.\n\nAccording to the San Francisco Chronicle, the Canal District is at risk.\n\nThe surrounding region has a soil foundation that fills former wetlands. Its topography causes the land to sink even as the ocean rises.\n\nPer the Chronicle, \"parts of eastern San Rafael have sunk by several feet.\" Over the last 25 years, sea levels have risen 3 inches. Experts expect 12 inches between the next 25 and 45 years.\n\nThe impacts are being felt by the Latino and working-class residents. High tides swamp patios and parking areas. Moisture seeps into homes, causing mold and mildew.\n\n\"People aren't necessarily aware that this is happening,\" noted Rita Mazariegos, a member of a community sea-level rise steering committee, per the Chronicle.\n\nThis rising water is a direct result of human activity.\n\nIt's brought on by burning coal, oil, or gas, creating planet-overheating pollution. As these energy sources warm the Earth, glaciers melt, and seawater expands.\n\nIsolated weather events, like a high tide or a heavy rainstorm, are temporary shifts. Climate impacts are a long-term pattern of extreme weather.\n\nExtreme weather, such as hurricanes and wildfires, has always existed. However, human-induced changes in the climate can exacerbate life-altering extreme weather.\n\nDo you worry about having toxic forever chemicals in your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nThe San Rafael neighborhood's main exit roads would suffer from this sea-level rise. They could be permanently underwater by 2050, per the Chronicle.\n\nThere are many ways to protect these shorelines and cool the planet.\n\nSan Rafael is exploring engineering solutions. Some methods include elevating roadways, upgrading pump stations, and building levees.\n\nExperts suggest innovating architecture in flood zones. One example of a redesign, per the Chronicle, is to \"flood-proof on the first floor.\" Designing buildings to float, as successful models in the Netherlands do, is another consideration.\n\nPeople can address critical climate issues and support local policies for clean energy. Using electric cars and appliances will reduce the pollution that causes rising tides.\n\nFair funding and organizations such as the Canal Alliance are developing communal builds.

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nWhile joining the millionaire club may feel out of reach for many young Americans, the power of compounding can make it possible.\n\nIt’s simple: you invest a small sum of money each month into a low-cost index fund. When you earn dividends, you automatically reinvest those proceeds to buy more shares, and your returns grow over time.\n\nBut there’s a catch, says personal finance YouTuber Mark Tilbury: the magic only really happens after you’ve invested your first $100,000.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers.

About 56% of Americans believe the cost of living is too high, according to a survey conducted by Politico last month (1).\n\nWhile it might take you longer to reach this milestone than it did previous generations, it’s still worth pursuing.\n\nHere’s why the first $100,000 is so important and how to reach it quickly.\n\nAfter you hit $100,000, “compound interest stops being lame,” according to Tilbury. “Getting that chunk of money as fast as possible is the key. [...] Once you get to this point, it’s almost inevitable that you’ll be wealthy if you just invest in a low-cost index fund.”\n\nTo get there, Tilbury suggests people follow what he calls the GROWTH method:\n\nG: Gain control of your finances.\n\nO: Optimize your tax management.\n\nT: Tap into additional income streams.\n\nGaining control of your finances is crucial for achieving long-term financial stability and reaching your goals. And according to Tilbury, there’s only one way to gain control of your finances — budgeting. Once you’ve assessed your budget, there may even be ways you can shave off some unnecessary dollars and avoid unnecessary spending.",

In ‌a previous statement, Hilton said the property was independently owned and operated.\n\nDHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the department welcomed Tuesday's move by Hilton.\n\n\"Discriminatory business practices targeting DHS and deliberately undermining federal law enforcement are unAmerican and have real business consequences,” she said in a statement on X.\n\nEverpeak Hospitality, which runs the Hampton Inn, was not immediately available for comment on the video on Tuesday.

    "description": "Brazil surpassed the U.S. as the world's top beef producer last year, according to market estimates, after the South American country",
    "fullText": "BARRETOS, Brazil, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Brazil surpassed the U.S. as the world's top beef producer last year, according to market estimates, after the South American country beat output forecasts by hundreds of thousands of tons, easing a global supply squeeze and helping limit a surge in meat prices.\n\nBrazil was already the biggest beef exporter, shipping meat worth almost $17 ​billion in 2025, according to government trade data released on Tuesday. Beef production numbers are not due until February, but analysts have recently raised their estimates. Farmers have been sending more animals to ‌slaughter, cashing in on high export demand from countries including China and the U.S., where low supply has pushed beef prices to record levels.\n\nElevated slaughter typically leads to a period of low output as producers hold back animals to breed and rebuild herds. But productivity gains in Brazil ‌may limit or even prevent a downturn, people in the industry say. They noted that farms have been inseminating cattle quicker, fattening them faster and slaughtering them younger.\n\n\"Ten years ago, the average age of cattle slaughtered in Brazil was five years,\" said Vinicius Barbosa, a commercial manager responsible for tens of thousands of cattle at the CMA feedlot in Barretos, about 260 miles (420 km) north of Sao Paulo. \"Now it is 36 months and going rapidly to 24,\" he said.\n\nMauricio Nogueira, head of livestock consultancy Athenagro, said Brazilian beef production far surpassed his forecast in 2025. Output grew 4% for the year, where he had predicted a 2.7% drop. The increase of around 800,000 tons was about equal to total annual exports of ⁠Argentina, the world's No. 5 beef shipper.\n\nRabobank, which had expected Brazil's beef production ‌to decline in 2025, now sees 0.5% growth to 12.5 million tons carcass weight equivalent. The U.S. Department of Agriculture in December raised its estimate for Brazilian beef output by 450,000 tons to 12.35 million tons.\n\nIf the official numbers confirm market estimates, 2025 will be the first year that Brazil's output will have surpassed U.S. production, which fell 3.9% ‍to 11.8 million tons in 2025, according to USDA estimates, following years of drought.\n\nFEEDLOTS, RISING CARCASS WEIGHT DRIVE OUTPUT\n\nU.S. beef production will fall a further 0.9% to 11.7 million tons in 2026, the USDA said. In Brazil, the USDA and Rabobank project a decline in output, but Nogueira said rising productivity could actually boost Brazil's production by around 300,000 tons.",

    "description": "With queues cleared and staking yields near 3%, the “supply shock” narrative is fading even as Ethereum remains the largest DeFi base layer.",
    "fullText": "Ethereum’s staking queues have emptied out and the network can now absorb new validators and exits almost in real time.\n\nThis means the rush to lock up ETH has faded for now and staking is settling into a steady-state instead of a scarcity trade.\n\nQueues are simply the time spent to start or stop staking on the Ethereum network, acting as a sentiment gauge and a liquidity gauge.\n\nIn one sense, the lack of queues is a feature, not a bug, as these are proof Ethereum can handle staking flows without locking up liquidity for weeks.\n\nAt the same time, staking rewards have compressed toward 3% as total staked ETH grew faster than issuance and fee income, limiting incentives for renewed surges in either direction and leaving queues near zero even as overall staking participation remains elevated.\n\nLower yield can reflect crowding, but also a higher ‘trust premium’ — more ETH is choosing to sit in staking rather than on exchange order books.\n\nWhat this means in plain terms is that “staking pressure” is no longer a daily narrative.\n\nWhen queues are long, ETH supply is effectively being locked faster than the network can onboard validators, and that can create a sense of scarcity.\n\nWhen queues sit near zero, the system is closer to neutral. People can stake or unstake without waiting weeks, which makes staking feel less like a one-way door and more like a liquid allocation.\n\nThis changes the psychology around the ether trade.\n\nStaking still reduces immediate sell pressure, but it is not the same as coins being stuck. With withdrawals functioning smoothly, ETH behaves less like a forced lockup asset and more like a yield-bearing position that can be resized when sentiment shifts.\n\nOverall, Ethereum's staking supply is at around 30%, well below the 50% that Galaxy Digital predicted at the end of 2025. Expectations Galaxy had that ETH would sustain prices above $5,500 thanks to staking-induced supply shock, and that layer-2s would overtake layer-1s in economic activity, failed to materialize.\n\nEthereum’s DeFi TVL sits around $74 billion, well below its roughly $106 billion peak in 2021, even as daily active addresses have nearly doubled over the same period, according to DeFi Llama.\n\nThe network still accounts for close to 58% of total DeFi TVL, but that share masks a more fragmented reality.\n\nIncremental growth is increasingly being captured by ecosystems such as Solana, Base, and bitcoin-native DeFi, allowing activity to expand across the Ethereum orbit without translating into the same concentration of value or demand for ETH itself.",

    "fullText": "The Fallout show arrives in New Vegas in a shocking episode.\n\n on January 7, 2026 at 12:00AM PST\n\nSpoilers for this week's episode of Fallout to follow.\n\nLast week's episode of Fallout gave longtime fans and new viewers an update on the factions running around in the Mojave Wasteland. From Caesar’s Legion and the divide they had, to the NCR’s loosened grip on the area, to Maximus’ (Aaron Moten) big mistake, there was no shortage of shakeups. As a result, the episode felt as if it sidelined its leads in favor of world building. That’s not the case with this week’s entry, however, as we finally see Lucy (Ella Purnell) and Cooper (Walton Goggins) arrive in the long anticipated New Vegas. Let’s dive into what went on in the Mojave Wasteland this week.\n\nThe episode opens with one of the most exciting pre-war flashbacks to be depicted in the series, showing Cooper Howard on the Alaskan front during the liberation of Anchorage from occupying Chinese forces. Him and a squadmate are on a combat patrol sporting West-Tek’s T-45 Power Armor for the first time in combat and things aren’t going as expected. His squadmate’s armor keeps malfunctioning, locking his arm into place. Frustrated, Cooper opts to disobey orders from his commanding officer and sends the soldier back to base to continue his combat patrol alone. This plan backfires, as he’s soon ambushed by a platoon of Chinese soldiers who cause his armor to malfunction and send him straight to the floor. Just as all hope seems lost and they prepare to kill him for his armor, a terrifying roar is let out. Shortly after, a Deathclaw appears and massacres the platoon in gory fashion. The deathclaw examines Cooper and leaves him thinking he’s dead; meanwhile on the radio, his commanding officer lets him know that the liberation of Anchorage was successful.\n\nJumping to the present, we join Maximus in the immediate aftermath of Paladin Xander’s death. Maximus learns that the Brotherhood of Steel has tracked them to Thaddeus’ (Johnny Pemberton) bottling plant. Realizing that the Brotherhood will kill all of the ghoul children if they go inside--and not wanting them to know he killed Xander--Maximus pleads with Thaddeus to get inside Xander’s power armor and pose as him. Realizing that they have no choice and wanting to save the kids, he reluctantly agrees and begins to stumble around in the power armor to start the ruse.\n\nLucy wakes up after being hung on a cross by the Legion and being saved by Cooper. Unaware where she is, she learns that she’s in the NCR remnant camp. As they prepare to head back to their destroyed home of Shady Sands, the NCR informs her that Cooper saved her and asks her about her quest to find her dad and what she will do when she finds him. When she says she plans to bring him to justice,, they tell her about the NCR’s mission of bringing justice back to the wasteland and if she ever needs allies to find them. Realizing they have too much luggage to haul back, they offer her a duffel bag of weapons for her journey. She and Cooper set out for The Strip.\n\nWe get a brief look at the happenings of Vault 33 and their dead waterchip. Crops are dying and water is being desperately rationed. But the “Products of Inbreeding” club have plenty for their social gathering because of a promise made by Overseer Betty (Leslie Uggams), a promise she quickly regrets.\n\nAs they arrive on the outskirts of New Vegas, Lucy begins exhibiting strange symptoms such as heavy breathing and itching. Unaware of what’s happening to her, Cooper informs her that she spent the last two days with Buffout--an in-game steroid known for its addictive properties--hooked into her veins. That’s right, she’s become addicted to drugs. With no idea what to do and no time to sit out a five day withdrawal cycle, Cooper offers her the only thing that will help: more drugs.\n\nMaximus and Thaddeus return to Area 51 with the other members none the wiser. Dane (Xelia Mendes-Jones) confronts Maximus about his actions and how he took off unauthorized with Paladin Xander. This is when Maximus drops the truth nuke and informs Dane that he killed Xander. Shocked, Dane brings up how his actions will start a war with The Commonwealth Brotherhood of Steel. Maximus assures him it won’t come to that point as he plans to kill Elder Cleric Quintus (Michael Cristofer)\n\nElsewhere in the Los Angeles Wasteland, Norm (Moisés Arias) is out exploring with the rest of the inhabitants of Vault 31. One of them reminisces on what she was doing before she entered cryosleep and how she interviewed with Vault-Tec right before. To her, 200 years has only been a week. As he plots their next move Norm is confronted by Ronnie, Bud Askins’ personal assistant, who challenges his leadership. Being so close to Bud, Ronnie reveals that Phase II of the experiment of Vaults 32 and 33 are important but ominously keeps details vague.\n\nVault 32 Overseer Steph (Annabel O’Hagan) meets with Vault 31 Overseer Betty in the inter-vault chambers that connect the two. Betty informs her that without a waterchip, Vault 31 doesn’t have much time left. She pleads with Steph to use their waterchip but is refused unless she can provide Steph with Hank Maclean’s keepsake box. Betty inquires what’s inside but Steph refuses to tell her. Unbeknownst to the both of them, their entire meeting is being spied on by Woody (Zach Cherry).\n\nCooper and Lucy arrive at the entrance of The Strip but something seems off. It’s entirely abandoned, with destroyed securitrons littering the streets. Cooper scouts the area and discovers it is infested by the Kings gang, who have mutated into vicious ghouls. With few options before them, Cooper suggests entering The Strip through Freeside to avoid any conflict. Lucy, high on drugs, grows impatient and shoots a ghoul in the legs alerting the rest of them and a bloody massacre ensues. As she shoots down every last ghoul, she starts to realize she enjoys the violence. Meanwhile, Cooper realizes New Vegas may have fallen, and Lucy notices one of her fingers begins to look discolored.\n\nBack at Area 51, Thaddeus struggles to blend in as Xander due to how little experience he has with power armor. Despite heading to the mess hall to get away from everything, he’s confronted by the leader of the Yosemite chapter who offers to kill Elder Cleric Quintus in exchange for support from The Commonwealth. The leader of the Coronado chapter arrives and offers the same deal, saying his soldiers are at the ready. Unaware of how to handle the situation, Thaddeus begins to have a panic attack inside of his power armor.\n\nElsewhere, Maximus confronts the Elder Cleric and informs him that he killed Xander and pulls a gun on him. When questioned why he would commit such an act, Maximus informs him that he killed Xander because he was going to kill a group of ghoul children. Angered, the Elder Cleric begins ranting about how that goes against the Brotherhood’s code and how their mission is to restore America and the Wasteland to its former glory. He pulls out a pistol and gets into a firefight with Maximus.\n\nDane steals the Cold Fusion relic to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands and chaos ensues when other members of the Brotherhood realize it's gone. The Yosemite leader kills Coronado’s leader and the various chapters of the BoS enter full blown conflict. In the ensuing chaos, Maximus manages to lock the Elder Cleric in the room and meet up with Dane, who gives him the Cold Fusion relic and tells him to get far away from there, Thaddeus joins him and together in the mayhem they manage to flee Area 51\n\nWoody calls out Steph for violating vault safety by meeting with Betty in the inter-vault chambers, pointing out that they should only be used for authorized use. Steph thanks him and says it should be reported to the Overseer, which is herself, so his concerns are immediately tossed aside. While they’re talking, Chet (Dave Register) uncovers a hidden drawer of Steph’s that houses a Canadian ID card that belongs to her, revealing that she is not American.\n\nAs Lucy and Cooper travel further downThe Strip, they notice that the surrounding area is completely abandoned. Lucy wonders where all the people are and Cooper once again suggests they should go to Freeside to learn what happened to New Vegas. The silence is broken as Lucy’s Pip-Boy starts detecting radiation and a vicious roar cuts through the air like a knife. Frozen in their tracks, Lucy and Cooper are mortified at the sight of a massive Deathclaw who has its sights set on them.\n\nAfter last week’s update episode, this week’s Fallout was a remarkable improvement. We finally saw Lucy and Cooper arrive in New Vegas, Brotherhood of Steel reach its breaking point, and a deep look into the happenings of Vaults 32 and 33. Many elements from the games were introduced into the show such as the liberation of Anchorage, Deathclaws, and addiction. There’s no doubt in my mind that the following episodes will have even \n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com",

In one, thieves broke into a trading card store and smashed display cases, while a second incident saw a collector held up at gunpoint for a briefcase of rare cards.\nTrading card store Simi Sportscards in the Simi Valley was the target of a break-in early Sunday morning, KTLA reports, with CCTV footage showing a group of at least five thieves smashing display cases to steal the cards inside. Store owner Jake Miller says the group stole rare sports trading cards and valuable Pokémon TCG cards after sawing through the front door. He estimates the break-in will cost the store over $50,000 in repairs, lost merchandise, and security upgrades.",

    "description": "Ethan Spibey, 33, quit his director-level job in London to move to Barcelona, where he runs his own business. He asked himself: \"if not now, when?\"",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ethan Spibey, 33, a consultant who lives in Barcelona. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nTwice a month, I commute from Barcelona to London: landing at around 10 a.m. on Tuesday morning and catching the 6 p.m. flight back on Wednesday.\n\nIt sounds like a hassle, but waking up in one of the world's most amazing cities instead of an unremarkable London suburb is worth an extra hour or two of commuting each month.\n\nI spent a year in Barcelona in 2013 while studying economics and Spanish as part of my four-year degree in the UK. I loved everything about the city: the food, the culture, the beaches. Plus, it's relatively affordable, the people are beautiful, and the weather is amazing. I knew it was only a matter of time before I went back.\n\nAfter I graduated in 2014 and started my career in London, I returned to Barcelona almost every year.\n\nIt showed me how easy the journeys were and that commuting between the UK and Spain was viable. There were multiple flights a day, and return tickets typically cost around £60 ($80) compared to £130 ($174) for my monthly railcard in London.\n\nLife is also much better value in Barcelona than in London. At the restaurant beneath our apartment, it is hard to spend more than £35 on a meal for two, and coffees cost roughly half what we paid in London.\n\nBut years passed, and I still hadn't made the move.\n\nI don't plan to have children, so I didn't have the usual excuses for choosing stability over risk.\n\nAside from my husband and family, striving for independence was the thing that mattered to me most. Relocating to another country felt like the single most independent — and thrilling — thing I could do with my life.\n\nIn the summer of 2024, my husband and I committed to moving to Barcelona.\n\nThen came the question of what to do about work.\n\nAs a self-employed stock trader, my husband could work from anywhere. I knew I couldn't move to Barcelona with my job because of their policies and the tax implications. That left me with two options: finding a new role with a Spanish employer or starting my own business.\n\nQuitting my job and launching a UK-based consultancy while living mostly in Spain felt exciting and made the most sense, because I could still leverage my UK-based network.\n\nAt the end of 2024, I left my job and launched Born Advisory, a communications business that provides bespoke training to CEOs to help them connect more effectively with people through interviews and public speaking. I named it Born Advisory, after my favourite neighbourhood in Barcelona, El Born.\n\nGetting a visa was slow but straightforward because I'm married to a German and therefore qualified for a spousal visa. Because Germany and Spain are both in the European Union, citizens can live and work freely across member states. Without that route, I would have needed an entrepreneurial or digital nomad visa, both of which are harder to secure.\n\nMy visa was approved in 2025 after more than six months of waiting.\n\nWhen I travel to London for meetings, I usually stay with friends, but I can also book a budget hotel room for about £100 when necessary. As a business expense, it's negligible.\n\nThe mental health benefits far outweigh any cost or inconvenience. The opportunity to recalibrate my life was far more important to me than the stability and predictability of a job.\n\nMy clients say they are very happy with me, and I think that's because I'm so much more personally invested in my work than I was when I was just taking home a salary.\n\nUltimately, in 2024, I asked myself, \"If not now, when?\" You can make excuses for years, but life is short. I'm glad I eventually made the decision to relocate.\n\nThis is the first time I've taken absolute responsibility for what I want to do with my life — and it has turned out to be the most refreshing and invigorating decision I've ever made.",

    "title": "The DoorDash Deep Throat scam lays bare our new era of untruthiness",
    "description": "The uncomfortable reason the internet fell for a fake delivery app whistleblower.",
    "fullText": "This past weekend, the internet was set ablaze by a post on r/Confessions claiming to be from a software engineer-turned-whistleblower working at a food delivery app. \"I'm posting this from a library wi-fi on a burner laptop because I am technically under a massive NDA,\" wrote the purported Deep Throat. \"You guys always suspect the algorithms are rigged against you, but the reality is so much more depressing than the conspiracy theories.\"\n\nThe poster then went on to make a series of claims about the exploitation of both workers and customers at the unnamed company. Delivery drivers, they said, were called \"human assets\" by project managers working to \"squeeze another 0.4% of margin\" out of them. They were ranked according to a \"desperation score,\" and had their wages stolen by using \"predictive modeling to dynamically lower the base pay.\" Customers were being scammed by the app's priority-delivery function, which was actually just a \"psychological value-add.\"\n\nThe post went viral, racking up 87,000 upvotes on Reddit. Commenters began speculating about which company the clandestine whistleblower was talking about, with many eventually pointing the finger at DoorDash. It was reposted on dozens of subreddits including the page for delivery drivers where hundreds of commenters thanked the whistleblower for confirming what they already felt. A screengrab of the post garnered more than 40 million views on X, where journalists, activists, and even famous actors got in on the action. \"A perfect example of the mindless greed that is sucking generosity and kindness from the American psyche,\" John Cleese wrote.\n\nEventually, at midnight on Sunday, DoorDash's CEO Tony Xu stepped in to debunk the claims the company referred to Dashers as \"human assets,\" and that it tracked their \"desperation score,\" or didn't make their priority delivery faster. \"This is not DoorDash, and I would fire anyone who promoted or tolerated the kind of culture described in this Reddit post,\" Xu wrote on X.\n\nBusiness Insider's Alex Bitter was also in contact with the poster. In a series of messages on Friday and over the weekend, the person declined to identify themselves, even for Business Insider's verification purposes, or get on the phone to discuss their post. The poster also provided files that had a high likelihood of being AI-generated, according to tools that check text for signs of AI. The person then did not respond to more questions. By Tuesday evening, the post had been deleted on Reddit.\n\nSo how were so many people duped? For one, the would-be whistleblower's claims were not completely outlandish. DoorDash, for example, has faced litigation for alleged wage theft. The post went viral because it seemed to confirm what we already suspected about the AI that permeates every aspect of our lives, as opaque algorithms do everything from help airlines maximize prices when you book a flight ticket to help landlords jack up the cost of monthly rentals.\n\n\"Conspiracy theories are a type of rumor that helps us make sense of the world,\" says T. Kenny Fountain, an academic who studies how conspiracy theories spread online. \"We hear constantly about these algorithms doing these bad things. It makes sense we are attracted to conspiratorial rumors that involve systems that seem impenetrable to us.\"\n\nA human desperation score doesn't seem all that farfetched when a little more than a decade ago Meta (then known as Facebook) was caught emotionally manipulating people by messing with the kind of news that appeared on our feeds.\n\n\"If I had just come across that post I would have believed it,\" AI researcher Timnit Gebru, who in 2020 blew the whistle on racial biases in Google's large language models, tells me.\n\nEven if the poster is a fabulist, Gebru explains, the claims eerily rhymed with how the gig economy actually operates. This past fall, researchers at the AI accountability nonprofit that Gebru founded, DAIR, released a report on AI surveillance of Amazon delivery drivers. It found that delivery drivers are required to download an app called Mentor that monitors how they drive, ranking them from \"Fantastic Plus\" to \"Poor.\" But the app doesn't take into account real-world conditions — a police officer forcing you to veer off track because of a temporary blockade or a child following a runaway ball across the road forcing you to abruptly hit the brakes. All of which, the report says, can ding a driver's score and lead to their firing if they fall below an undisclosed threshold. That's just one of the apps Amazon uses to monitor its workers and drive them to such extremes that they have resorted to urinating in their vans rather than taking bathroom breaks that might risk their productivity rating.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson said the report — written by a former Amazon delivery driver, and included six interviews with drivers working for 10 different providers who work for the company — is based on \"incomplete data and methods that seem designed to reach conclusions determined from the start.\" The person added that the company has \"a central operations facility that makes adjustments in the app in real time to account for changing conditions, whether they be weather or otherwise.\" The spokesperson did not respond to my follow-up on what Amazon considered complete data.\n\nSimilarly, last year DoorDash settled a $16.65 million algorithmic wage theft lawsuit with the state of New York. The lawsuit accused the company of using tips to lower Dashers' base pay. As part of the settlement, the Attorney General ordered DoorDash to revise its payment practices and offer drivers more transparency about the breakdown of their paychecks, but DoorDash did not have to admit to any wrongdoing.\n\nWhen asked for comment, a spokesperson for DoorDash directed us to the company's blog post about the Reddit hoax. \"Dasher base pay is determined by three factors and three factors alone: time, distance, and desirability of a given offer. That's it,\" the company wrote. The spokesperson adds that the settlement \"is related to an outdated pay model that hasn't been in place at DoorDash for several years.\"\n\nThere is also a meta-level irony to a conspiracist using AI to stoke fears about how AI is exploiting us. The barrier to creating misinformation has become far lower while detecting these falsehoods is becoming increasingly difficult.\n\nAsk any college student or professor and they'll tell you that detection software is notoriously bad at picking up where texts were written by AI. The Verge also noted that its attempts to put the original reddit post through AI detection software yielded mixed results.\n\nEven detecting fake images — which once produced visible watermarks and quirky signatures (too many fingers or weirdly moving mouths) — has become near impossible to detect since November when Google released Nano Banana Pro and allowed virtually anybody to create perfect-looking AI generated images.\n\nAnd yet fabricating evidence through those very AI tools is what led reporters to catch the conspiracist. In response to reporters' requests to back up the claims, the redditor sent a seemingly real ID from Uber Eats with their identifying information blacked out alongside another official-looking report, marked \"confidential,\" that purported to corroborate the information in the reddit post. They were caught when Google's AI detection software marked the Uber Eats ID as generated by Google's latest image-generation AI. (Uber also confirmed that the card didn't match the actual IDs used by the company.)\n\nBut Google's detection software can only tell if an image was generated by the company's AI. Had the faker used another image-generation tool, or been slightly more precise with how they prompted it, they may have gotten away with it. As one of the journalists that debunked the claims, Casey Newton, writes, \"I'd love to tell you that, having had this experience, I'll be less likely to fall for a similar ruse in the future. The truth is that, given how quickly AI systems are improving, I'm becoming more worried.\"\n\nI'm more optimistic about the DoorDash dustup. First, the post's virality proves that we aren't all too jaded to be unmoved by the accounts of exploitation that have become essential to how our modern economy functions. On the other hand, even with the most sophisticated AI fabrication software available today, the anticipated information apocalypse seems to have been successfully staved off.\n\nOne major consequence of AI making it much easier to create and disseminate misinformation is that the actual work of truth-seeking is evermore valuable. That is not to disregard the crisis of trust in the news industry. As publications' revenue from social media companies all but evaporates, newsroom leaders would do well to reckon with how the engagement-bait era of the 2010s eroded peoples' trust in our work. Trading the slow and meticulous work of rigorous fact-checking in favor of pushing quick content for likes and retweets will not be a sustainable business practice in an era of sophisticated dupes and falsehoods. DoorDash Deep Throat is the latest case study for why.\n\nWe might never know why this redditor spent the weekend hatching an elaborate plan to fool the internet. But if the information environment of the foreseeable future is flooded with viral hoaxes, or if the ubiquity of such misinformation gives powerful figures the ability to cry fake news when faced with authentic leaks, the institutions that strive to foster the public's trust have the most to gain.\n\nAdditional reporting by Alex Bitter.\n\nTekendra Parmar is a former features editor at Business Insider.

    "title": "ChatGPT is the new WebMD",
    "description": "Chatbots are making amateur lawyers and doctors out of everyone. The real professionals have second opinions about it.",
    "fullText": "A few times a week, Jonathan Freidin, a medical malpractice attorney in Miami, says he'll notice that people will fill out his firm's client contact sheet with text littered with emojis and headings. That's a telltale sign that they copied and pasted from ChatGPT. Other clients will say they've \"done a lot of research\" on their potential case using AI. \"We're seeing a lot more callers who feel like they have a case because ChatGPT or Gemini told them that the doctors or nurses fell below the standard of care in multiple different ways,\" Friedin tells me. \"While that may be true, it doesn't necessarily translate into a viable case.\"\n\nPeople are increasingly turning to generative AI chatbots to research everything from dinner recipes to their complex legal and medical problems. In a December 2025 survey from the legal software company Clio, 57% of consumers said they have or would use AI to answer a legal question. A 2025 Zocdoc survey found that one in three Americans use generative AI tools to get health advice each week, and one in ten use it daily. Zocdoc CEO Oliver Kharraz predicted in the report that \"AI will become the go-to tool for pre-care needs like symptom checking, triage, and navigation, as well as for routine tasks like refills and screenings.\" He cautioned that he also believes \"patients will recognize that it is no substitute for the vast majority of healthcare interactions, especially those that require human judgment, empathy, or complex decision-making.\" If he's wrong, Zodoc and its competitors have a problem.\n\nDoctors and lawyers are now sifting through generative AI emails or working to convince laypeople that they have the expertise and understand nuances of how each local judge acts or how a patient's medical history plays into their condition. Generative AI has democratized access to information that was often elusive and expensive to obtain, but it's also shifted how legal and medical professionals talk to people, and what people expect of them.\n\nChatGPT is the new WebMD and LegalZoom, turning the average person into an armchair expert with just a few prompts. And it's driving the real experts crazy.\n\n\"We have to dispel the information that they were able to obtain versus what is actually going on in their case and kind of work backwards,\" says Jamie Berger, a family law attorney in New Jersey. For example, Berger says that until recently most people knew little to nothing about the legal proceedings of divorce, and would come to the attorneys seeking information. Now, they might come armed with a step-by-step gameplan, but it's generic, and likely not the best fit for their situation. Berger will notice after emailing a client if their tone suddenly changes, that they might be using AI to write out lengthy legal strategies or questions. Then, she has to explain, \"it's not necessarily your factual circumstance,\" and address their various points. \"You have to rebuild or build the attorney-client relationship in a way that didn't used to exist,\" says Berger. \"They don't realize that there's so many offshoots along the way that it's not a linear line from A to Z.\"\n\nLike a real expert, generative AI chatbots speak with authority. That can be far more persuasive than reading a blogpost on a legal issue or summaries of medical conditions on a forum. A third of Americans said yes in a 2025 survey from Survey Monkey and financial services company Express Legal Funding that asked: \"Would you ever trust ChatGPT more than a human expert?\", although respondents were less likely to use it for medical and legal advice, and more likely to consult it for educational and financial advice.\n\nChatbots also have an infinite amount of doctors' most precious re\n\nAI also acts as a second opinion without the wait. Heidi Schrumpf, director of clinical services at teletherapy platform Marvin Behavioral Health, says she's had patients return after a counseling session and tell her that they took her input to ChatGPT or another AI bot, and that they trust her because the bot confirmed what she said. But Scrumpf isn't offended by being double-checked. \"It's great that they have the access to a quick second opinion, and then, if it doesn't agree with me, that allows them to ask me better questions.\"\n\nA 2024 poll tracking health misinformation from health policy research group KFF found that 17% of US adults said they consult AI chatbots at least once a month, but 56% of those people were not confident that the info from the AI chatbots was accurate. Still, people are turning to ChatGPT in growing numbers. \"That type of technology does want to encourage patients to continue to interact with them,\" Allen says. \"Ultimately, you do need a human in there to understand the nuances of the communication and the softer communication skills, and the unspoken communication skills, and the entire medical picture and the history.\"\n\nWithout detailed information, the chatbots will likely give generic advice. But supplying too many personal details is also a risk. People are handing over their entire medical histories to ChatGPT, but HIPAA, the federal law that protects confidential health information, doesn't apply to consumer AI products. There's also a risk of voiding the kind of protections people get from the attorney-client confidentiality privilege if people put too much specific information about their case into a chatbot, says Beth McCormack, dean of the Vermont Law School. And, they likely still need an attorney to really understand the implications of AI's legal advice. \"There's so much nuance to the law,\" McCormack says. \"It's so fact dependent.\"\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson declined to provide comment on the record for this story, but told me that ChatGPT is not meant to substitute legal or medical advice, but act as a complimentary resource to help people understand medical and legal information. The spokesperson also said the company is trying to improve the responses of its models, and that it takes steps to protect personal data in the event of legal inquiries. OpenAI made changes to its policies last fall, specifying that users cannot turn to ChatGPT for \"provision of tailored advice that requires a license, such as legal or medical advice, without appropriate involvement by a licensed professional,\" but the chatbot does still answer health- and law-related questions.\n\nProfessionals aren't totally against their patients and clients consulting gen AI. There are shortages of doctors, and cases that require hiring an attorney with upfront money that people don't have. While the information spit out by AI isn't always perfect, it largely makes previously gate-kept legal and medical advice accessible, breaking it down without jargon. For people who can't afford upfront legal costs, turning to AI can be helpful in some cases, says Golnoush Goharzad, a personal injury and employment lawyer in California. People are using ChatGPT to represent themselves in court, to act as a stand-in therapist, nutritionist, or physical therapist. For people who can't afford lawyers and are facing issues like eviction or needing to file small claims cases, AI tools have helped them win. But Goharzad says she's had conversations, sometimes with friends, where they think they have cases to sue landlords or others. She asks, \"Why? That doesn't even make any sense, and they're like, well ChatGPT thinks it makes sense.\"\n\nThe chatbot floodgates have opened, and it's too late for professionals to resist them. People are going to keep doing their own research. Rather than fight it, experts say there's room to recognize and advise people on the best ways to use them. \"We need to keep as clinicians in the back of our mind that this might be a tool that is being used, and it can be very helpful, especially with some guidance and integrating it into our treatment plans,\" Schrumpf says. \"But it could go sideways if we're not paying attention.\" For experts, the time has come to assume that AI is also working on the case.\n\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

    "title": "'Burden of command': How a brutal recruiting mission broke some Marines leading the charge",
    "description": "Marine recruiting leaders faced extreme pressure during the pandemic, leading to allegations of abusive work conditions, investigations, and firings.",
    "fullText": "Marine recruiters have long faced some of the most challenging workplace conditions of all military recruiters, the Pentagon's own surveys show. A Business Insider investigation reveals the pressure to find enlistees hasn't been limited to rank-and-file recruiters; it has also taken a toll on higher-ups, contributing to a raft of firings and allegations of abusive work conditions.\n\nInterviews and Marine Corps investigation documents exclusively obtained by Business Insider detail how two colonels lost their leadership posts during the pandemic era. Two others were also fired — one who was removed from her job spoke about the stress she experienced.\n\n\"It was overwhelming,\" retired Marine Corps Col. Heather Cotoia said. \"It's the burden of command. You're responsible for everything your Marines do or fail to do.\"\n\nCotoia said she was officially relieved, or fired, over her \"leadership\" and was never given an explanation of what that meant. Representatives for the Marine Corps declined to provide details, citing privacy concerns.\n\nTwo other colonels in a neighboring district were also relieved between 2021 and 2023, according to Marine Corps investigation documents. In a typical year, only a handful of colonels across the force are relieved, making the concentration among recruiters highly unusual.\n\nThe documents and interviews reveal pockets of a system that were pushed to the edge during the pandemic, when already steep recruiting goals collided with school closures, new medical-screening hurdles, and shrinking pools of young Americans eligible for service. As the pressure escalated, the military found, some commanders resorted to intimidation and rule-breaking.\n\nAccording to one investigative report, a commander relieved in 2023 said that recruiters needed to hit the streets like \"French whores\" to meet their quota of two sign-ups a month.\n\nIn another case, a commander relieved in 2021 encouraged subordinates to send applicants to medical processing even if they had recently failed the Corps' in-office drug test.\n\n\"If they're hot, bring them down anyway,\" the commander, whose name was redacted in the documents, allegedly said to subordinates, referring to positive drug tests.\n\n\"Get them all on the schedule,\" he was quoted as saying. \"This is about mission. We have to make the mission.\"\n\nThe Marine investigations into the two colonels, who each oversaw regional operations in the Midwest, were detailed in two Marine Corps Inspector General reports obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests. Following the probes, both colonels were relieved.\n\nIn the 2021 case, the commander's order to process applicants who failed drug tests provoked a moral crisis among subordinates who felt it violated the Corps' recruiting rules, the documents said.\n\nOne subordinate alleged the commander called the officers under him \"disgruntled temporary workers.\" Another spoke of intimidating phone calls in which the colonel told subordinates that they could not afford to fail in recruiting. Others were \"brow-beaten,\" verbally berated, psychologically abused, and threatened with being fired if they couldn't find enough new recruits, the report and witness statements say.\n\nIn 2023, a second colonel — the one who allegedly made the remark about \"French whores\" — was relieved after being found by an investigating officer to have berated subordinates. Multiple witnesses expressed an omnipresent sense of dread and said the climate was oppressive, driving some to consider leaving the service entirely.\n\nThe report issued by a general noted that the colonel was under the gun. His region, the Midwest, had \"failed to accomplish its assigned recruiting mission for over a year,\" the general said. At least two subordinate officers leading Midwest recruiting hubs were fired in the six months preceding the new colonel's arrival. The region's recruiters \"lacked confidence, were prone to excuses, and had developed a 'woe is me mindset,'\" the general said.\n\nThe Corps told Business Insider that it does not tolerate abusive leadership.\n\n\"Allegations of misconduct or inappropriate command climate are investigated,\" a spokesperson said. \"When violations are substantiated, the Marine Corps takes corrective action that best supports Marines, mission, and command now and into the future.\"\n\nSome leader firings didn't come with accusations of misconduct.\n\nCotoia said one of her subordinates — a previous recipient of a top leadership award — was relieved for failure to recruit. One of her deputies also lost his job, with little explanation provided, she said.\n\nThe Midwest and Rust Belt, where the leadership firings were concentrated, face heightened recruiting pressure, according to recruiters and the investigation documents. The regions have few major bases where young Americans encounter troops in day-to-day life, meaning fewer chances to spark interest in service simply by proximity to military life. Even before the pandemic, the region's big cities weren't producing recruits at the level of those on the coasts or in the South, sources said.\n\n\"The problem was they were expecting the same effort from recruiters in different markets to have the same outcome,\" said a longtime current recruiting official.\n\nRecruiters in those regions were \"over-missioned,\" the official said— tasked with finding too many recruits from too few prospects, despite the Marine Corps' painstaking efforts to allocate recruiters properly. Every missed goal invited more scrutiny from above, they said.\n\nThe pandemic ratcheted up recruiting pressures across all military services. High schools went virtual, cutting off a primary access point, and community events vanished. Then in 2022, a new medical-screening system known as Genesis caused processing delays by flagging minor issues in many recruits' medical histories. (The military has since improved the system, a spokesman said, acknowledging \"early implementation contributed to delays and uncertainty at a time when the recruiting environment was already under extraordinary pressure.\")\n\nOne officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Business Insider he logged workweeks of 80-plus hours in 2021, and estimated that some enlisted Marines had hit 100-hour weeks dialing hundreds of phone numbers, scouring social media for local high schoolers, and meeting with hesitant parents to promote the benefits of enlistment. A second officer said that within his first three months on the job, his focus shifted away from recruiting and toward \"saving the Marines,\" referring to their well-being.\n\nWhen asked about such extreme work hours reported by some recruiters, the Marine Corps said 2024 recruiter welfare surveys show a small decrease in the number of recruiters who report working over 60 hours weekly since 2022, down from 91% to 82% of recruiters. \"While long work hours remain a challenge, this decrease demonstrates progress in alleviating the workload,\" a spokesperson said. The Corps did not share full copies of the survey.\n\nThe longtime recruiting official told Business Insider that officer reliefs slowed after then-Major Gen. William Bowers took command in 2022 and oversaw an external study on shifting demographics of potential recruits. Such surveys are designed to give recruiting leaders an early read on population shifts and how willingness to serve varies across different communities.\n\nThe pandemic \"placed a level of strain on the recruiting enterprise that was unlike anything we've experienced in the past,\" a Marine Corps Recruiting Command spokesman acknowledged to Business Insider. Recruiters, and those in charge of them, were up against \"extraordinary pressure\" and facing \"extreme conditions felt across the entire recruiting enterprise.\"\n\nRecruiting across the military has recently been on the uptick. New Pentagon figures show a strong start to fiscal year 2026, boosted by Army and Navy pre-boot camp preparatory courses that help low-scoring or overweight applicants increase scores and fitness to meet military standards. And some regions for the Marine Corps are thriving, the recruiting official said.\n\n\"I think we've turned the corner, and production is way up,\" he said of recruiting across the country, though the Midwest and Rust Belt lag behind other regions.\n\nCotoia is cautiously optimistic about the future of recruiting too. A recent restructuring for the Corps has pushed more recruiters into the growing southern US.\n\nShe worries that certain challenges will persist, however, such as reaching young people who live mostly online.\n\n\"It's easy to get stuck in a mindset of, 'we have a formula, and it's worked for so many years,'\" Cotoia said. Some may wonder why change is needed when things seem to be going well. The answer, she said, is that the system is \"breaking at the cost of people, and of good people.\"",

    "fullText": "They may be small, but toothbrushes can create mountains of waste. Experts reveal how to clean and care for them and extend their life\n\nThe best electric toothbrushes, tested\n\nIf toothbrushes were sentient, they’d complain about their lot in life. Their thankless existence involves repeatedly cleaning one of the grimmest parts of the body, then being thrown out once their bristles are insufficiently effective. Or, in the case of electric toothbrushes, decapitated before resuming their duties with a fresh head.\n\nThis relentless cycle is essential for hygiene reasons: an ineffective brush can lead directly to tooth decay and gum disease. However, given the big dual crises of our time – climate and cost of living – it would certainly help for toothbrushes to last a bit longer. So what can we do to maximise their longevity without sacrificing dental hygiene?\n\nEvery electric toothbrush has a battery inside the handle that, just as with a phone, will degrade over time. In most cases, this battery isn’t easily replaceable, so treating it well is essential.\n\n“In general, it’s best not to charge your battery frequently, whether it’s ours or any other [toothbrush brand’s] batteries,” says Gyve Safavi, co-founder of the electric toothbrush maker Suri, which has made sustainability a key selling point.\n\nFrequent charging erodes battery capacity, he says. “If you want it to last as long as possible, charge it overnight and leave it. Don’t charge it again until it goes out.”\n\nRead our Suri 2.0 electric toothbrush review\n\nYou may think that keeping your brush clean is a hygiene-only issue, but it’s also helpful for bristle longevity.\n\n“I have seen patients ruin heads more from storage habits than from brushing,” says Dr Alan McCaffrey, founder of Red Rock Dental in Las Vegas. “Both electric and manual brushes can last longer than most people think if they are cared for correctly, but they should never be used past the point where bristles are frayed or ineffective.\n\n“One way to extend the life of the head is to rinse it thoroughly in hot water after every use and then let it air dry upright,” he says. “Moisture trapped at the base [of the bristle] is what causes buildup and weakens bristles faster.”\n\nDr Nicole Khalife, owner of Lux Smiles in New York, agrees. “Clean bristles dry faster than those that stay sticky. Dry bristles are less friendly to germs, and the brush lasts longer.”\n\nSome toothbrushes come with travel caps: small covers that can be placed over the head of the brush to protect it from dirt and detritus in luggage. But you should only use them when on the road, Khalife says. “They protect the head from dirt in a suitcase, but at home, they trap moisture. Use a ventilated pouch instead of a solid cap and always let the brush dry before packing it.”\n\nIf your brush doesn’t fully dry between uses, you could switch between brushes or heads each day, McCaffrey suggests. “Giving the bristles a day to fully dry helps them keep their shape and stiffness for longer.”\n\nIt’s not just the heads that need cleaning. There’s usually a visible gap between them and the body, and excess toothpaste can calcify around here, which could interfere with how the brush functions. Use a damp cloth to gently remove this, and then dry it thoroughly when done.\n\nAllowing the brush to air dry is important, especially when it comes to charging. I’m pretty sure I got through a couple of Suri 1.0 chargers after repeated contact with a damp brush caused rust on the conductive metal connectors.\n\nStorage is only one part of the toothbrush longevity puzzle. “Many people press hard because they think it makes their teeth cleaner,” says Khalife. “In fact, intense pressure bends the bristles and scratches the enamel. A gentle circular motion works better because the tips of the bristles sweep away plaque without flattening the fibres. Bristles that keep their shape will reach between teeth and along the gumline for the whole life of the brush.”\n\nElectric toothbrushes have an advantage here, with users encouraged to let the motor’s vibrations do the work, rather than brushing as with manual ones.\n\n“Electric toothbrushes are designed to help prevent over-brushing, which can cause damage to your enamel and gums,” says Barty Walsh, CEO and founder of electric toothbrush maker Ordo. “If you’re going through brush heads faster than two to three months, this is a sign you may need to change your brushing technique.”\n\nIt’s worth looking for an electric model with a pressure sensor, which will warn you when you’re pushing too hard.\n\nFrom a sustainability and consumption perspective, you’d ideally not buy a new model – no matter how shiny and wonderful the adverts make it look.\n\n“The best thing we can all do is use what we have for as long as we can,” says Suri’s Safavi.\n\nEventually, all toothbrushes will die, and continuing to brush with them beyond their useful lifespan is bad for your teeth. If your manual brush’s bristles are splayed beyond recognition, or your electric brush’s battery will no longer hold a charge, then it’s time to dispose of it responsibly and move on.\n\nBamboo brushes are the easiest to recycle: remove the nylon bristles, and then compost the bamboo handle or find an alternative use for it (see below).\n\nFor plastic manual brushes, it’s worth seeing if the manufacturer has a recycling programme. If not, you can see if Terracycle has a collection point near you.\n\nIf there’s no local option bar landfill, you can always find alternative uses for brushes. Even splayed bristles can be effective at cleaning between bathroom tiles. While I was able to donate the electric toothbrush bodies from my group test, the heads were rightly considered unhygienic, so they have enjoyed a second life cleaning my cats’ grubby chins.\n\nSome brands recycle brush heads free of charge, including Suri and Ordo, while LiveCoco, Brushd and Edinco sell recyclable heads for Oral-B and Philips Sonicare devices. But if companies won’t, “find an e-waste bin, if your council has one”, says Safavi, “and if not, there’s RecycleNow online”.\n\nWhether you’re using an electric toothbrush or a manual one, bristles degrade at the same rate, with experts agreeing on a lifespan of three months for brushes used twice a day.\n\nOf course, for electric toothbrushes, the heads can be replaced, giving them an advantage in the longevity stakes. That said, they’re not a clean win for sustainability as they rely on lithium-ion batteries. There are myriad environmental issues here, from the huge water use, land degradation and chemical leakage associated with the mining of Earth minerals, to hazards connected to the batteries’ disposal.\n\nThere are several more sustainable manual options – particularly those with a bamboo body – which promise a more environmentally friendly middle ground. However, as I covered in my guide to the best electric toothbrushes, experts agree that manual brushes aren’t generally as effective at teeth cleaning.\n\nAs Caitlin Miller, head of hygiene and therapy at Bupa Dental Care UK, put it to me at the time: “To get the same level of cleaning found with an electric toothbrush, you’d have to spend a lot longer than two minutes brushing with a manual.”",

    "fullText": "AI company’s chatbot faces criticism over its generation of sexualized, nonconsensual images of women and girls\n\nElon Musk’s artificial intelligence company has raised $20bn in its latest funding round, the startup announced Tuesday, even as its marquee chatbot Grok faces backlash over generating sexualized, nonconsensual images of women and underage girls.\n\nxAI’s Series E funding round featured big-name investors, including Nvidia, Fidelity Management and Resource Company, Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, and Valor Equity Partners – the private investment firm of Musk’s longtime friend and former Doge member Antonio Gracias. The funding round exceeded its initial $15bn target, according to xAI’s press release. The company touted Grok’s image-generation abilities in the announcement of its latest funding round.\n\nxAI lacks the prominence of its rival OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, and has continually drawn criticism for generating misinformation, antisemitic content and now potentially illegal sexual material. Nonetheless, the company has been able to win government contracts and billions of dollars in investment amid the AI boom. xAI’s latest funding round comes during some of the fiercest pushback against the company yet, with lawmakers in multiple countries demanding answers regarding Grok’s output.\n\nOver the past week, Grok has responded to tens of thousands of prompts from users on X requesting the chatbot remove women’s clothing in images or pose them in sexualized ways. Many of the prompts have included images of women who have not given their consent to be digitally undressed, including Ashley St Clair, the estranged mother of one of Musk’s children.\n\n“I felt horrified, I felt violated, especially seeing my toddler’s backpack in the back of it,” St Clair told the Guardian, adding that her complaints to X did not go anywhere. The Guardian’s request for comment from xAI resulted in an automated response stating “Legacy Media Lies”.\n\nSome of Grok’s images included a photo of a 12-year-old girl, which the chatbot manipulated to remove the child’s actual clothing and depict her instead in a bikini. Other suggestive images have featured children as young as 10 years old. The chatbot posted an apology on Friday that stated lapses in its safeguards led to generating images of minors, but continued to generate sexualized images of children in the ensuing days.\n\nxAI has been seeking investment for months as it works to increase its AI models’ capabilities and build out enormous data centers in Memphis, Tennessee. The company claimed the new funding would help its core mission of “Understanding the Universe”.\n\nFrench ministers reported Grok’s output to prosecutors on Friday and referred the episode to media regulators to decide whether the images violate the European Union’s Digital Services Act. Liz Kendall, the UK’s technology secretary, also condemned Grok’s deepfakes on Tuesday as “appalling and unacceptable”, calling on the British regulator Ofcom to take action. Ofcom posted on X that it had made contact with xAI to determine whether an investigation is warranted. Lawmakers in the US, where xAI is headquartered, have remained comparatively mum.\n\nThe company made a similar funding announcement in July of last year during another controversy over Grok. A week after the chatbot began posting antisemitic content and pro-Nazi ideology, including describing itself as “MechaHitler”, xAI announced it had secured a contract with the US Pentagon worth nearly $200m.",

    "title": "I deleted Instagram from my phone for a year. Being desktop-only connected me to friends without the drawbacks.",
    "description": "In late 2024, I deleted Instagram from my phone and only used it on desktop. It made me want to be more offline.",
    "fullText": "A little over a year ago, I started my 2025 resolution early: purging Instagram from my phone.\n\nIf you're a boomer or Gen Xer — someone who didn't grow up uploading multiple albums of each college party onto Facebook — I understand your judgment. Removing Instagram from my phone (while still using my account on my desktop) sounds as dramatic as switching to skim milk.\n\nBut that app was a social lifeline. It was where people announced their engagements, graduations, and pregnancies. It was how I tapped into what my friends (and friends of friends) were up to on a random Tuesday — a breezy conversational springboard. It assured I never fully lost touch with anyone: not with high school classmates, distant family members, or people I vaguely remembered meeting once at a party, long ago.\n\nWhile I'd waste fewer hours scrolling through painstakingly staged influencer weddings and overly simplified political infographics, I'd also miss milestones and inside jokes. Recede too much, and I might lose entire connections.\n\nIn the end, it was the best decision I made last year — arguably, in many years. I became a significantly happier person, and even the annoying parts of being a desktop-only Instagram user felt like perks.\n\nAt first, I'd still compulsively tap into the \"social media\" folder on my phone, expecting to find that sunset-hued camera icon. After about a week, I adjusted to my new reality. Like a treat-deprived lab rat, I picked up my phone less.\n\nWhat I called \"ghost emotions\" were gone. For the decade-plus I've had Instagram on my smartphone, I was used to sleepwalking into the app, seeing an image that vaguely stirred some negative emotion in me (envy, annoyance, exclusion), and carrying the remnants of that feeling into whatever I was doing in the real world.\n\nThis lined up with what researchers have found: that, for some people, social media is linked to higher irritability and declines in mental health. These side effects can outweigh the positives, like staying more connected to friends.\n\nInstagram declined to comment on this story.\n\nWithout the overload of information that didn't add anything to my life — and the nagging pressure to contribute to it — I felt like my brain was freer to enjoy other pursuits. I finished more books (and seemed to better process what I read). I busied my hands with crocheting instead of scrolling. Parties became more fun because I no longer mentally pre-rehearsed the photos I would take or the captions I would write.\n\nThere were some downsides to no longer having the app on my phone.\n\nWhile I generally didn't miss the pressure to post, it was frustrating not to have that option on the desktop version. When someone posted my professional work, all I could do was \"like\" the post and move on instead of resharing it. And if I was tagged in a friend's story and didn't check within 24 hours, I had absolutely no idea what they said.\n\nThe biggest hurdle was remembering birthdays. I'd grown used to depending on friends' story announcements. Now, if I didn't want to look like an ice-cold jerk on everyone's special days, I had to get creative.\n\nSo, I set aside about an hour one day. For birthdays I didn't already have memorized, I combed through every DM on Instagram, scrolling back to when I said \"happy birthday!\" and wrote every date into a Notes document on my phone.\n\nDid I feel slightly unhinged? Yes. But I also know no one's ever been mad about you wishing them a happy birthday (though, perhaps a few in my circle were a little spooked).\n\nI also pushed myself to get over my lifelong fear of reaching out first. If I wanted to feel social without social media, I'd need to be a little more outgoing.\n\nSometimes, this meant writing down reminders to text people when I thought of them, but was too busy at the moment to reach out. Other times, I offered to host the next knitting club or book club, or took the initiative to coordinate group plans when I'd usually wait for someone else to pick up the slack.\n\nThe social isolation I was so worried about never happened. If anything, I felt more social because I was prioritizing in-person interaction.\n\nOnce I got a taste of how freeing being offline could be, I wanted to go a step further.\n\nI hated how often I woke up (or stayed up late) reading the news. My insatiable need to always be in the know left me more scattered and irritable. So, I cut down on that, too. Halfway through the year, I bought a Brick device to block apps like my email or the internet on my phone.\n\nYes, sometimes, there are downsides. I've missed (or been late to) big life updates from less-close friends. I've drifted apart from a few others, with whom I shared mostly a meme-exchanging sort of friendship. While bittersweet, it has also helped me focus on fewer, closer friends than an unmanageably large network.\n\nNow, I spend my mornings journaling, chatting longer with my husband, or actually making it to a workout without rushing out the door. Eventually, I check my Instagram DMs the way I'd peruse my email in the 2010s. I tap a heart, I laugh at a video, and I return to my life.",

    "description": "Big Tech is largely throwing in the towel on big, virtual-reality face computers. But they're trying again with smaller glasses like Meta's Ray-Bans.",
    "fullText": "The tech industry has spent roughly a gazillion dollars trying to convince people to strap face computers on their heads. It hasn't worked.\n\nBut the tech guys haven't given up. Their new pitch: Instead of buying bulky goggles that replace your reality with a computer-generated version of something else, what about some glasses?\n\nYou can see evidence of the switch-up with a couple of recent news stories:\n\nAt first glance, this makes a bunch of sense: People don't wear big heavy stuff on their head unless they have to — like if they're skiing, perhaps. But lots of people wear glasses. So if the tech guys want to sell new tech, they should stop trying to make things people don't wear and focus on the things people already wear.\n\nThe reality is a little more complicated: Shrinking a computer — or even parts of a computer — into something that looks, feels, and weighs like glasses is incredibly hard. The lighter and cheaper you make them, the less they can do — which makes it harder to justify why you'd wear them at all.\n\nSo when Meta says it has been selling a ton of Ray-Ban Display Glasses, which start at $800 a pair, you need to put that in context: The company sold an estimated 15,000 units in the last three months of 2025.\n\nWe are likely to get a much better sense of consumer demand for this stuff in the next couple years, as more competition arrives.\n\nGoogle plans to sell glasses that work much like Meta's this year, though I assume they will be cheaper, since they don't use the \"neural wristband\" Meta includes with its glasses. It is also working on more ambitious glasses with more functionality — seemingly like the \"Orion\" headset Meta showed off in 2024, but has yet to start selling.\n\nApple, meanwhile, has reportedly shifted resources from its Apple Vision Pro so it can make some Meta-style glasses itself. And Meta is plugging away at \"Phoenix\" — a headset that's bigger than its Ray-Bans but still much smaller than the Quest headsets it has been selling for years. Those were supposed to launch in 2026 but have been pushed back to 2027, Business Insider's Jyoti Mann reported this week.",

    "description": "McKinsey chief Bob Sternfels said AI had led to a shift in its workforce, with half the business adding jobs and the other half shrinking.",
    "fullText": "McKinsey's top executive shared some hard numbers on how AI is reshaping the consulting giant's workforce.\n\nBob Sternfels, McKinsey's global managing partner, appeared at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Tuesday for a live taping of the \"All-In\" podcast with co-host Jason Calacanis and Hemant Taneja, CEO of General Catalyst.\n\nSternfels said AI has fundamentally changed how McKinsey staffs its business, allowing it to add and cut jobs in equal measure while still achieving overall growth.\n\nReferring to it as the \"25 squared\" approach, Sternfels said McKinsey is growing its client-facing roles — what you typically picture when you think of a McKinsey consultant — by 25%. At the same time, he said non-client-facing roles, which make up the other half of its workforce, have shrunk by about 25% while output from that side has grown 10%.\n\n\"Our model has always been synonymous that growth only occurs with total head count growth. Now it's actually splitting. We can grow in this part, the client-facing side, and we can shrink in this part and have aggregate growth in total,\" he said. \"That's a new paradigm and a new dynamic.\"\n\nSternfels said the firm has seen massive productivity gains as it's embraced AI, saving 1.5 million hours in search and synthesis work last year alone. Instead of doing the work that's typically done by more junior employees, he said McKinsey consultants are \"moving up the stack\" and tackling more complicated problems.\n\nMcKinsey employees also have a brand new set of coworkers that are increasingly becoming an essential part of the company: AI agents, which can act independently like digital employees. Sternfels said that as of last week, the company had 40,000 human employees and 25,000 personalized agents. Sternfels said AI agents are able to handle entire job functions on their own.\n\nHe expects McKinsey to have about the same number of AI agents as human employees by the end of the year.\n\nFor young professionals coming into the workforce, Sternfels said they should think about honing skills that AI can't do, setting the right aspirations, human judgment, and true creativity.\n\nBusiness Insider has previously reported on how AI is disrupting consulting and changing the ways firms like McKinsey make money, including by shifting to an outcome-based pricing model.\n\nThe workforce changes at McKinsey also reflect a broader challenge facing large, established companies as AI disrupts how we work.\n\n\"This is about how do you transform incumbent entities into something different,\" he said at CES, adding that for large existing enterprises \"you have a choice — transform or die.\"\n\nHe added that companies are \"moving at literally warp speed now.\"\n\n\"I haven't met a CEO yet that isn't talking about 'how do I get my organization moving faster,'\" he's said. \"It's quite frankly less about strategy, it's more about organizational speed.\"",

    "description": "An arbitrator ordered Bed Bath & Beyond CEO Marcus Lemonis to pay $14 million after finding he violated a 2021 settlement tied to \"The Profit.\"",
    "fullText": "Marcus Lemonis, the new CEO of Bed Bath & Beyond, was ordered by an arbitrator to pay more than $14 million to a group of business owners whose companies appeared on \"The Profit,\" a CNBC reality show he hosted until 2021.\n\nThe arbitrator found that Lemonis violated the terms of a 2021 settlement barring him from making statements that could harm their reputations, according to documents filed in New York state court. The documents were filed as part of a petition to confirm the arbitration award after a 30-day payment deadline lapsed.\n\nThe business owners said Lemonis ran afoul of the settlement terms when he spoke about them negatively over the span of roughly a year, starting in November 2021.\n\n\"In the ten years of making 'The Profit,' I probably — from people who were just dumb or people that had bad character — I probably lost $50 million,\" he said in December 2021.\n\nBoth sides went to arbitration in May 2025, and the 98-page decision was issued in late November. It was filed in New York State Supreme Court at the end of last year.\n\nThe arbitrator, retired judge Ariel Belen, concluded that Lemonis' \"disdain for the respondents, complete disregard to his obligations in the settlement agreement, and apparent lack of concern for the harm suffered by respondents were all put on full display during the arbitration hearing.\"\n\nLemonis, the former CEO of Camping World, was directed to pay $100,000 for each of three violations — for a total of $300,000 — to 47 parties, for a sum of $14.1 million.\n\nLemonis had 30 days to pay. The petition was filed in state court one month after the arbitration award was issued, and alleged that Lemonis failed to pay. The document seeks a judge's order to make it enforceable.\n\nA New York state judge has not yet ruled on whether to confirm the arbitration award. Lemonis and his lawyers at Latham and Watkins have yet to file a response or opposition to the petition. They have until early February.\n\nLemonis and his attorneys didn't respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nIn 2021, Lemonis and NBCUniversal, whose business news network CNBC aired \"The Profit,\" settled for $11 million, with 40 companies that appeared on \"The Profit\" paid $275,000 each, after the companies alleged they suffered harm by appearing on the show, as first reported by Business Insider.\n\nThat settlement included terms that prevented the small business owners and Lemonis from disparaging each other.\n\nLemonis hosted \"The Profit\" from 2013 to 2021, dispensing business advice and tough love tactics to over 100 small businesses across the U.S. More than 50 filed lawsuits, engaged in mediation talks, or settled over the harm they say they endured, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nAs early as 2013, a business owner hired an attorney to try and prevent NBCUniversal from airing their episode, which they said contained misrepresentations, records obtained by Business Insider show.\n\nTwo years later, a different business owner sent a letter to NBCUniversal \"informing them of the fraud and defamation that the show and Lemonis perpetrated on him.\"\n\nA similar sentiment was echoed by business owners who testified during the May arbitration. Michael Kilchenstein, who founded a ski company called RAMP Sports, said that the company's main investor told them to shut down after Lemonis reneged on the deal agreed to during filming.\n\n\"This whole thing has been the most stressful, painful thing I've ever been through,\" Kilchenstein testified.\n\nKilchenstein declined to comment.\n\nLast year, Lemonis debuted a new show on FOX, called \"The Fixer,\" with a similar premise to \"The Profit.\"\n\nLemonis stepped down as CEO and chairman of the board at Camping World on January 1. Earlier this week, Bed Bath & Beyond, the home goods retailer that went bankrupt in 2023 and where Lemonis had been executive chairman, said he would take over as CEO.",

    "description": "Two Y Combinator veterans behind a nine-figure exit have now raised $15 million, led by YC CEO Garry Tan, to build an AI-powered money manager.",
    "fullText": "Serial entrepreneurs and two-time Y Combinator grads Dillon Erb and Daniel Kobran announced Wednesday that they have raised $15 million to build a personalized AI-powered financial advisor.\n\nErb and Kobran sold their first startup, the GPU cloud company Paperspace, to DigitalOcean for $111 million in 2023. The idea for their latest startup, Autonomous Technologies Group (ATG), emerged as they sought to organize their finances following the sale.\n\nATG, a finance-focused applied AI research lab, is emerging from stealth with its first product, the wealth strategist app Autonomous.\n\nAutonomous aims to compete with the robo-advisors and traditional wealth managers that Erb and Kobran say offer generic advice or charge steep fees.\n\n\"We're not saying that we have an AI that's going to pick all the best stocks for you,\" Erb said.\n\nRather, Autonomous helps users implement strategies employed by the ultrawealthy, such as lowering taxes by managing individual stocks instead of standard index funds, and automatically adjusting portfolios to manage risk.\n\nY Combinator CEO Garry Tan led ATG's $15 million pre-seed round through a dedicated YC alum vehicle. Tan partnered with Erb and Kobran during their first stint at YC in 2015. BoxGroup and Collaborative Fund also participated in ATG's pre-seed round.\n\nThe company has 15 employees across New York and San Francisco, and it will use the funds to hire more product engineers and AI researchers.\n\n\"The financial advisory industry is one of the last holdouts where human intermediaries extract massive value without creating it,\" Tan said in a statement. \"This is the right team at the right inflection point.\"\n\nIn addition to startups like Stash, Vise, and Range, which apply AI to wealth management, big banks are also rushing to embrace AI in ways that could transform the finance sector.\n\nThe Autonomous app will launch this quarter and will be available for free to early users. It uses real-time market data and personal context to provide proactive portfolio monitoring and wide-ranging advice about users' financial lives, including investments, home purchases, and job offers.\n\nWhile Autonomous provides free advice that users can apply to existing accounts, the company makes money through a separate product called Autonomous Index, an account where users can execute trades with manual approval. It also helps users build portfolios comprising individual stocks, enabling tax savings and deeper personalization.\n\nThough Autonomous is ATG's flagship product, the company aims to establish an AI-powered financial institution that automates services typically performed by human advisors.\n\nKobran said ATG is building toward coordinating a user's entire financial picture, including assets such as retirement accounts, cryptocurrency, and startup equity. Over time, he said it could take on work like angel investments and estate planning.\n\nHe said he wants the app to make \"everything a family office does for a billionaire accessible to everyone.\"",

    "description": "ChatGPT's web traffic has decreased since November, when Google launched Gemini 3. ChatGPT still has the lead, but it could signal shifting tides.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI's recent \"code red\" over Gemini makes a lot of sense when you look at the data.\n\nWhile the ChatGPT maker continues to dominate the AI race, competitors are gaining ground. In November, Google released Gemini 3 Pro, the first iteration of its Gemini 3 class of models.\n\nSince then, Gemini web traffic has increased while ChatGPT web traffic declined, according to Similarweb data first highlighted by Menlo Ventures partner Deedy Das.\n\nIn December, Gemini traffic increased by 28.4% month-over-month, while ChatGPT traffic decreased by 5.6%, the data shows.\n\nThe chart's data only tells part of the story, only accounting for site visits to chatgpt.com and gemini.google.com. It does not factor in use of the consumer apps or other integrations, like Google's AI overviews in Google Search.\n\nAnd while there's no guarantee that one traffic trend is directly because of the other, the data highlights the shifting tides of the AI race.\n\nWeb traffic for both ChatGPT and Gemini are up year-over-year, but their estimated site traffic growth rates are staggeringly different. ChatGPT traffic is up 49.5%; Gemini's traffic is up 563.6%, per Similarweb.\n\nChatGPT still has a healthy lead. In December, ChatGPT attracted 5.5 billion visitors, according to Similarweb. Gemini came in second with 1.7 billion; DeepSeek, Grok, Character.AI, Perplexity, and Claude all trailed behind with fewer than 400 million visitors each.\n\nAfter its launch, Gemini 3 was lauded as a potentially market-leading model. It was more visual and creative than previous iterations, and was better at coding.\n\nGoogle has also flexed its primary advantage over OpenAI: the ability to integrate its AI within its highly used search products. Basically everyone uses Google — OpenAI must convince people to turn to ChatGPT instead of the search giant's products.\n\nOpenAI and Google are also competing in the image generation market. Less than a month after Google released its Nano Banana Pro AI image model, OpenAI announced the launch of ChatGPT Images.\n\nGemini 3 famously triggered a \"code red\" at OpenAI. In an internal Slack message, CEO Sam Altman reportedly told staff that OpenAI would prioritize ChatGPT while pushing back other product plans.\n\nIn December, Altman said on the \"Big Technology\" podcast that the company would not be in emergency status \"that much longer,\" and that \"code red\" periods normally last six to eight weeks.\n\nAltman also said that Gemini 3 did not have \"the impact we were worried it might.\"\n\n\"But it did — in the same way that DeepSeek did — identify some weaknesses in our product offering strategy, and we're addressing those very quickly,\" he added.",

    "description": "Amy Errett, the founder and CEO of Madison Reed, told Business Insider she sticks to a strict structure to get through her busy days.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Amy Errett, the founder and CEO of Madison Reed. Errett is based in Northern California and founded the hair care company in 2013. Since then, Madison Reed has grown to 90 locations across the country. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nLife as a CEO is busy, and I start my days early with exercise, meditation, and a strong cup of coffee, before I jump into a morning of back-to-back meetings.\n\nI'm very disciplined about how I work and communicate, but I try to keep time for thinking and being outside, especially at the end of the week.\n\nIn the evenings, I slow down with family, simple rituals, and sleep, so I can do it all again the next day.\n\nThe first thing I do when I wake up is check my phone to make sure nothing urgent happened overnight, especially since I'm on the West Coast.\n\nMy wife, Claire, is a professional artist and also a professional chef. I'm lucky — I get a home-cooked meal almost every night. That's also why I have to weigh myself every morning before I exercise or drink anything. I also track my sleep and stress using an Oura Ring.\n\nWithin about 45 minutes of waking up, I work out at home using my Peloton and Tonal. Five days a week, I do 30 minutes of cardio and 15 minutes of strength training.\n\nAfterward, I meditate for about 10 minutes using Henry Shukman's app, The Way.\n\nI travel a lot, but for three days, I work from home. At my home in Marin County, I work from a small pod, a 110-square-foot room in my backyard — made in Canada — that is my private workspace. I'm a nature person, and being surrounded by grass and trees is like getting plugged into an energy source.\n\nI also have a condo in San Francisco, which I go back and forth between.\n\nBefore I start work, I make a coffee with two regular shots and two decaf and bring it with me, along with water.\n\nMy workdays are highly structured. I have weekly one-on-one meetings with everyone who reports directly to me, always at the same time each week. Those blocks are fixed, and everything else gets scheduled around them.\n\nMy assistant, Christina, is essential to keeping my schedule running. We meet three times a week and plan weeks in advance.\n\nMy meetings include internal check-ins, conversations with the PR team, and external meetings. I also mentor other women investors. I've been on the board of my alma mater, Wharton, so there are sometimes external board meetings, and my own board meetings.\n\nI also personally interview every hire at the level of store general manager or above for 15 minutes before they receive an offer.\n\nThese interviews are focused entirely on cultural fit. I always ask one question: \"Tell me about something that didn't go well in your life, and what you learned from it.\"\n\nI'm looking for resilience, grit, honesty, love, and passion. Some of the answers I hear — about loss, hardship, or perseverance — stop me in my tracks and tell me who someone really is. I've had people tell me they are homeless and worked their way up to being a general manager somewhere else. That 15-minute process adds up, but it's incredibly important to me.\n\nI'm a protein loader, especially since losing a significant amount of weight. I aim to eat about 90 to 100 grams of protein a day. Cottage cheese is my best friend — it's high in protein, relatively low in calories, and keeps me full.\n\nMy go-to meal is a bowl of cottage cheese topped with a poached egg and a slice of gluten-free toast. I also allow myself one small indulgence: three days a week, I have a mini Coke Zero in the afternoon.\n\nI've tried to work with my assistant to carve out blocks of uninterrupted thinking time, but the truth is, I don't get much of it.\n\nMost days are packed back-to-back. I do, however, protect Fridays: I don't take meetings after 1 p.m., and that's when I catch up and think more freely.\n\nMy best thinking happens outside. I live near Marin, so I hike often.\n\nOn Fridays, I'll often leave right at 1 p.m. and drive to my boat alone. I don't talk to anyone — I just cruise, sit with my thoughts, and enjoy the scenery. Sometimes a close friend will join me, but most of the time it's solo.\n\nDuring the rest of the week, though, I'm extremely disciplined about communication.\n\nMy inbox is always at zero, and I respond quickly across email, Slack, text, and phone. I actually like calling people, even though most people don't — I think there's a lost art in picking up the phone and having a real conversation.\n\nIt's not always easy to stay on track — especially with such a tight schedule.\n\nThis work is personal to me. I'm putting my energy into it, and so are more than 1,100 other people. When something doesn't feel good — we didn't do right by someone, or we got turned down — I feel it deeply.\n\nI've gotten better at handling those moments over time. I work with an executive coach over Zoom twice a week. That's helped me understand what triggers me and how to recover more quickly. I still have emotional reactions — I'm very human — but I don't stay stuck in them the way I used to.\n\nWhen I feel overwhelmed now, I step outside and take a walk or just pause and take a breath. That reset helps me come back grounded.\n\nIt took a long time to get there, but it works.\n\nMost evenings, I like to unwind by watching sports. I follow several teams, record every game, and have access to all the streaming platforms, so there's almost always something on.\n\nDinner is an important part of my evening. My wife, Claire, and I sit down to eat together every night, usually around 6:15 pm. Before we eat, we say a blessing, and then we do \"roses and thorns,\" where we each share one good thing and one hard thing from the day. We've kept that tradition going since our daughter, Madison, who I named the company after, was young.\n\nAfter dinner, we'll usually watch something together. I tend to gravitate toward sports and thrillers, while Claire and our daughter have different tastes. Our dog, London, is usually right by my side.\n\nI try to be in bed by 10 p.m. and asleep by 10:30. I use a Hatch sound machine and an Eight Sleep mattress — both are game changers.",

    "description": "Market experts say geopolitical conflict is becoming a permanent force impacting commodities pricing, rather than a temporary blip on traders' radars.",
    "fullText": "It might be hard to tell by looking at the stock market, but investors are living in a new era of geopolitical risk.\n\nWhile equity markets have largely shrugged off the latest geopolitical shocks, the last few years of hot and cold wars have rewired commodities. From Ukraine to Venezuela, ongoing and emerging conflicts have impacted everything from oil to gold to copper.\n\n\"Geopolitical risk has always influenced commodity prices, but it is increasingly acting as a persistent pricing factor rather than a transitory shock,\" a team of commodities researchers at Oxford Economics wrote. \"While acute events can still trigger sharp price moves, markets now tend to embed a standing risk premium reflecting ongoing supply-chain fragility, trade fragmentation, and resource nationalism.\"\n\nUltimately, conflict is becoming a permanent pricing mechanism rather than a temporary blip on traders' radars.\n\n\"As a result, geopolitical considerations are more systematically incorporated into pricing, investment decisions, and procurement strategies across many commodity markets, rather than being quickly priced out once an event fades from headlines,\" they added.\n\nMany traders and experts say the start of this new era for commodity markets began in 2022 with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In nearly four years since then, the world has seen fresh fighting across the Middle East, rising tensions between China and Taiwan, and, most recently, the surprise US raid on Venezuela.\n\nThese episodes have been potent drivers of gold's rapid rally. Investors have flocked to the safe-haven metal as forecasters see the potential for further conflicts through the rest of this decade.\n\nFlare-ups across the Middle East between Israel and Iran and a two-year war between Israel and Hamas have only heightened gold's status as a hedge, while also boosting silver.\n\n\"We're going to have a lot of geopolitical uncertainty,\" said Desmond Lachman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, an economic policy think tank. \"When you get that, you get movement into precious metals as one of the safe havens. But added to that is the United States reliability as a partner to question is called into question.\"\n\nOil is an outlier in the new era, with prices steadily sliding even as geopolitical forces send investors flocking to other commodities. Crude fell 20% in 2025, with the summer's Israel-Iran conflict only causing a brief jump in the price of Brent.\n\nStill, energy investors are once again being forced to digest the potential for new conflicts to impact the market, mulling the potential for the US takeover of Venezuela to increase supply down the road.\n\nJeff Le, a managing principal at consulting firm 100 Mile Strategies, agrees that a new era has arrived for commodities.\n\nSpeaking with Business Insider, he highlighted how quickly the landscape appears to be shifting, pointing to rising prices not just of precious metals but of industrials as well.\n\n\"The surge of industrial metals over the last year, including gold to over $4,000 represents gains not seen in over four decades,\" he told Business Insider. \"This rush could be representative of a new chapter of the commodities market.\"\n\nBoth Le and Lachman noted the possibility of the US' action in Venezuela setting a new precedent for geopolitical action, highlighting its importance as a driving force for commodities.\n\n\"The Trump administration and growing global tensions appear to be more of a feature than a bug,\" Le noted. \"With three more years to follow, it's possible that geopolitical risk is not only a permanent consideration in the commodities market but a more important weight to investors.\"",

    "fullText": "My clearest memory from middle school is pacing in my bedroom, phone in hand, repeating the word 'wake' again and again. I was testing a voice app I had written. If I said the phrase just right, the app would respond. If not, I would tweak the code and try again.\n\nI had just learned to code from YouTube. My apps were getting downloads, and I was addicted. I would run home from school, drop my backpack, and open the reviews before starting my homework. It was the first time I saw that code written alone in my bedroom could reach people I would never meet.\n\nAfter studying engineering and business at UC, Berkeley, and spending nearly two years working at Meta, I'm now running Frontdesk, an AI startup that helps businesses automate millions of conversations with AI.\n\nMy early programming projects were playful. I built a text-to-speech app and a speech-to-text app. Then, one of my relatives slipped and fell at home. He was yelling for help, but nobody was home, and his phone was out of reach. If his phone had been able to hear him, it could've brought him help immediately.\n\nIn 2016, I developed Rescuer, a voice app that enabled users to trigger an alarm by shouting a secret phrase, automatically sending their location, photos, and audio to designated emergency contacts.\n\nRescuer earned recognition from political officials and the press. What mattered more was that I learned that code written from my bedroom could help someone. From then on, I began building for real impact.\n\nI started answering questions on coding forums, recording YouTube coding tutorials, and writing for an engineering blog. Over time, my answers on forums like Stack Overflow reached millions of developers, which only deepened my passion for continuous learning.\n\nThere was still one thing I couldn't figure out, no matter how many downloads my apps received. I didn't know how to turn an app into a real business. I didn't understand pricing, customers, or why some products became companies while others remained weekend projects.\n\nAs I was deciding where to attend college, I knew I wanted to learn about the business side.\n\nI chose UC Berkeley's M.E.T. program because I could study both engineering and business. I graduated with an EECS (electrical engineering & computer science) and business degree in three years.\n\nIn 2023, when ChatGPT had its big moment, I asked myself, What if I could just talk to this thing on a real phone line?\n\nOver a weekend, I hacked together one of the first prototypes that connected ChatGPT to a real phone number. I posted a short clip and a tweet, and it got a lot of attention.\n\nThe tech was not ready to be a real product. Latency was bad. Reliability was fragile. The models made strange errors. But that experiment planted a question in my mind that I could not shake: If this ever became good enough, what would it look like to use it to help real businesses?\n\nI shelved my phone experiment to join Meta. It was a dream setup. My team was incredibly supportive, I was learning how to build at a massive scale, and life was good — from the smart colleagues to the famous free food.\n\nI was part of a fintech team where I'd push one line of code, and millions of transactions would be affected. It felt less like a corporation and more like a high-growth startup; I was given incredible ownership from day one and learned \n\nBut I was spending all my time behind the code. The business side, the part I'd learned to love at Berkeley, felt far away. As an engineer at a big company, there was no clear path back to the center.\n\nI wasn't working directly on AI, but I could sense the momentum building. Every few months, the models improved noticeably. My ChatGPT phone hack stopped feeling like a viral stunt and started to feel like a glimpse of the future.\n\nAfter my post went viral in college, hundreds of businesses reached out, asking for a solution. I kept thinking about all those businesses, where a missed call meant a missed customer. I knew there was demand, I knew nobody was serving them, and I knew I wanted to be the one to build it.\n\nLeaving wasn't easy. Meta was comfortable, offering an incredible salary, stock refreshers, and interesting problems. Everyone told me to stay another year, vest more equity, and build more credentials. The rational move was to wait.\n\nI kept asking myself, if I waited, would I regret it? The window felt finite. Every month I stayed was a month these businesses were not being served.\n\nI raised capital, moved to NYC from California, and began building Frontdesk. I'm now the founder and CEO.\n\nFrontdesk is a comprehensive AI operating system that engages with customers across all channels and performs real-world tasks, such as scheduling and follow-ups.\n\nWe work in-person in an office in SoHo. Most people in our office share a similar story to mine; they left Microsoft, Amazon, or Meta, walking away from good salaries and stock options, because they believed this was worth building.\n\nI feel lucky to work with people who push me to be better every day.\n\nMost nights, my work looks the same as it did in middle school. I pace, talk into a phone, and listen for what feels off. The difference is that now, when it works, it works across millions of calls. It's the same instinct that led me to build Rescuer years ago.\n\nThe phones are still ringing, and the models are still getting better. I know where I want to be while that happens: close to the code and building something worth leaving comfort behind.\n\nDid you quit a Big Tech job to build your own company?

    "description": "The \"decasualization\" of fashion over two decades is finally winding down, and BofA says Adidas stock is at risk.",
    "fullText": "We as a society are far more casual than we used to be.\n\nPeople wear full-on pajamas to the airport. TV hosts regularly wear sneakers with suits on live broadcasts. You might even see a sports commentator wearing a hoodie under their suit.\n\nYou can probably get away with wearing jeans to dinner most places these days. Athleisure retailers like Vuori and Alo sell sweatpants for the same price as a nice pair of slacks (or more).\n\nBank of America has noticed too, and thinks the trend has peaked. In new research, the firm said we've reached the logical endpoint for a 20-year trend of \"casualization,\" a period that saw sneakers explode from 20% of the footwear market, all the way to 50%.\n\nThat's bad news for Adidas, which will see organic sales growth shrink into the single digits as its brand loses luster, according to BofA.\n\nThe firm thinks the situation for Adidas is so dire, in fact, that it took the bold step of double-cutting its rating on the company's stock to \"underperform,\" from \"buy.\"\n\nAt a time when peers are almost overwhelmingly bullish on shares after a difficult 2025, it decided to zigzag and post the most bearish price target on Wall Street. Shares fell as much as 7% on Tuesday. But analysts on the whole remain quite bullish on Adidas shares following a 29% drop in 2025.\n\nBofA thinks other major players in the sneaker space that have benefited from the same upcycle as Adidas — like Asics and On — will continue to pose as serious competition as consumers pivot more from casual attire towards sporting goods.\n\nThe sportswear giant — and recent beneficiary of some viral marketing, courtesy of captured Venezuelan President Maduro — is in the midst of its own turnaround under boomerang CEO Elliott Hill. The company's last earnings report saw strong North American growth drive a sales increase, a key signal for positive future prospects.\n\nAnd while Nike's stock hasn't exactly been a bright spot, down 14% since the start of 2025, that's still less than half of Adidas' decline over the period.\n\nBofA says a sustained recovery for Nike could come at Adidas' expense, since the two companies have historically seen inverse revenue growth. In other words, if Nike grows, Adidas contracts, and vice versa.\n\nBut wait, what about the World Cup? Surely defending champion and Adidas golden boy Lionel Messi will drive massive sales during this summer's tournament?\n\nNot so fast, says BofA. Once the endorphin rush of the World Cup passes, the firm says Adidas will be faced with the same old issues through year-end.\n\nAlthough BofA expects Adidas' share price to suffer, the company's plight could come with one key silver lining: the end of the sneakers-with-suits epidemic. One can only hope.",

    "fullText": "While you may not be able to outrun AI, you can move with it.\n\nWith AI transforming so many jobs, EY's Joe Depa says adaptability will be the \"new job security\" in 2026.\n\n\"The ability to adapt and change is going to be the most important component,\" said Depa, who oversees innovation at the Big Four consulting firm.\n\nThe executive, who leads EY's AI, data, and innovation strategies, told Business Insider that training and upskilling will be the factors that differentiate talent and organizations in the workforce.\n\nHe shared three ways he stays current amid rapid changes:\n\nWhether by pursuing a formal education or independent studies, Depa said that ongoing learning is key to staying up-to-date.\n\nDepa said he went back to school to get his Master's in Analytics from Georgia Tech just a few years ago to learn more about software development, programming, and data science. He said he knew he would be managing data scientists and programmers, and wanted to better understand their perspective. However, since earning his degree in 2020, software development has \"completely changed.\"\n\n\"You've got to always be learning and challenging yourself to learn every single day,\" Depa said.\n\nTo stay current on topics like AI, he said he listens to podcasts and reads articles about the latest news.\n\nDepa isn't the only leader who carves out regular time for learning new things. Visa's Oliver Jenkyn recently told Business Insider that he blocks off four hours a week to study a topic he wants to understand, like the technology of stablecoins or the history of the semiconductor industry.\n\nDepa said that, in addition to allocating time for individual learning, it's \"critical\" to lean on personal mentors.\n\n\"All of us should have our own personal advisors — mentors around us that we can call,\" Depa said.\n\nThe executive pointed to EY's global AI advisory council, which includes 20 top AI leaders who assist the firm in navigating the AI landscape. The council meets and provides feedback on different plans, Depa said.\n\n\"It's a really nice forum for me to test what's coming next,\" Depa said.\n\nThe global chief innovation officer said that having a council of opinions helps him challenge his thinking, but soliciting input from others doesn't have to be so formal. Having relationships with people with who you can check in with to get different perspectives is \"increasingly important,\" he said.\n\nDepa said that while education and learning from others are important, it's necessary to actually implement those teachings. That could mean vibe coding or creating an application.\n\n\"That whole learning experience is going to really help create new brain dynamics for you to learn the next thing and the next thing,\" Depa said.\n\nDepa said failure is a natural part of experimenting with tools and putting new ideas to practice. Getting comfortable with that discomfort, he added, helps build a mindset focused on challenging yourself and learning more.\n\n\"If you do it enough times, your brain will start to appreciate that process of formal learning, having a team of advisors, and then applying it and learning and growing,\" Depa said.\n\nBlackstone CTO John Stecher also emphasized the importance of being hands-on with technology in a recent interview with Business Insider. Stecher said he doesn't always create something \"spectacular,\" but he reserves an hour or two each weekend to experiment, whether that's using Claude to write code that automates his home, or creating a new tool to parse through documents.\n\n\"It's tactile and tangible,\" Stecher said.",

    "title": "A Facebook veteran took a big career risk that resulted in a 'giant failure' — but embracing a 'J-curve' career path paid off",
    "description": "Molly Graham, former Facebook and Google executive, shares how a risky career move and embracing a J-shaped career path grew her expertise.",
    "fullText": "At 25 years old, Molly Graham was thriving in Facebook's HR department when a senior executive urged her to transfer out of her stable role and help build a mobile phone instead.\n\nShe took the risk — and it could have derailed her career.\n\nBut Graham, who later became a C-suite executive at some of America's biggest companies and philanthropies, now views that risky bet as one of the most important moves she ever made.\n\n\"It just felt like falling off a cliff,\" Graham, now the founder of Glue Club, said in a recent interview on Lenny Rachitsky's podcast. \"Taking risks, accepting the terrible fall and that experience of falling has been more than worth it.\"\n\nGraham described the experience as part of what she calls the \"J-curve\" — a career trajectory where a risky move leads to an initial drop before eventually producing outsized gains. Visually, she describes it as standing on a ledge, stepping off, sinking briefly, and then rising far higher than where you started — just like the shape of the letter J.\n\nThe concept, which she has also written about in her Lessons Substack, challenges the idea of a steady career ladder that steadily moves up and to the right.\n\nInstead of climbing rung by rung with promotions every two to five years, Graham argues that some of the most valuable professional growth comes from jumping into roles you aren't ready for and surviving any setbacks.\n\nGraham's own J-curve began when billionaire investor and \"All-in\" podcast host Chamath Palihapitiya, then Facebook's vice president of growth, recruited her to help develop a smartphone, encouraging her to make the move by sketching out the J-shaped trajectory on a whiteboard.\n\nHe brought her on despite her having no experience in product development, dropping her into rooms filled with engineers and phone specialists with deep subject matter expertise. She recalled feeling like an \"idiot\" for much of her first six months.\n\nAt her midyear review, Palihapitiya delivered what Graham called the worst performance evaluation she had ever received. But the new experience eventually expanded her expertise.\n\n\"Slowly, I remember I had been doing all these trips to Taiwan because we were actually working on hardware and I, at some point, came back from Taiwan and I like drew on a whiteboard for him the layout of a mobile phone, trying to explain to him kind of like why something he wanted to do was not possible,\" Graham said. \"And I so vividly remember walking out of that meeting being like, 'Oh like I actually know things.' And slowly then over the following three years I became an expert in mobile.\"\n\nPalihapitiya did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\n\"The phone itself was a giant failure — a massive, costly failure for Facebook,\" Graham told Rachitsky on the podcast. \"But it was not a failure for me.\"\n\nShe credits the experience with teaching her that she could operate far outside her comfort zone — a lesson that later helped her take on senior leadership roles, including serving as COO of Quip, which Salesforce acquired for $750 million, and overseeing operations at the $7.4 billion Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.\n\nThe J-curve, Graham said, is especially common at fast-moving companies like Meta, Alphabet, Nvidia, and SpaceX, where leaders value employees who are willing to take big risks early and learn quickly. In those environments, proving adaptability can matter more than checking every qualification box.\n\nNot everyone supported Graham's decision at the time. She said Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, then the number two at the tech giant, advised against the move — as did her father.\n\n\"When wiser, more experienced people questioned the job offer, it definitely made me pause,\" Graham told Business Insider in a follow-up email. \"But my gut felt really strongly that I needed to take the risk.\"\n\nThat instinct, she said, ultimately helped her discover what kind of work she didn't want to do, and where her strengths lay. She didn't want to sift through mock ups of hardware design and argue about a button's placement. Instead, she sharpened her management skills and prepared to help lead large organizations.\n\n\"The much more fun careers are like jumping off cliffs,\" Graham told Rachitsky. \"They can take you to places that you never could have imagined.\"",

Maybe I have the flu. Maybe this is just me getting used to college food.

The pain got so bad that I was subsisting on a diet of little more than chocolate milk and mixed fruit from the dining hall.\n\nI knew I was getting skinnier, but I thought, \"Hey, that's what training hard can do.\" It's not uncommon to lose a little weight during football season.\n\nIt wasn't until the springtime, after I'd turned 20, that I realized how serious the weight loss had gotten. My friends and I were home messing around, cracking jokes, and jumping on the scale to see who'd lost and gained weight since college started. I stepped on the scale, and it registered 155 pounds. I had lost 30 pounds in half a year. That's when my dad called the doctor and made sure I got an appointment the next day.\n\nAfter a few visits, doctors discovered I was bleeding internally, and I was sent to the hospital for tests, including a colonoscopy. They couldn't even get the camera through my colon during the exam, because it was completely blocked. Later on, doctors told me my tumors were as big as a pineapple. Five pounds worth, and two of them had broken open and were spreading.\n\nI had stage four cancer — it was aggressive, and it was traveling throughout my body.\n\nHow could this be happening? I was a young college athlete, just out of high school, and a pretty healthy guy. How could I have late-stage colon cancer?\n\nBut I did. And I'm not alone. More and more, doctors are diagnosing young people with late-stage, aggressive colon cancers like mine, occurring decades earlier than what's \"normal,\" and catching everyone by surprise.\n\nGetting cancer felt like getting my free will ripped away from me. I lived in the hospital, underwent major surgery, got my insides stripped out, and then had a colostomy bag put in temporarily to deal with my waste. It was isolating, and I felt like I was living in a different universe.\n\nAfterwards, once the colostomy bag was removed and I was able to go to the bathroom on my own again, I had to get a physical therapist just to re-learn how to do the simple things in life. Things that weren't easy to me anymore included getting up, using the toilet, or having the ability to just move around the way I used to.\n\nOn top of that, I was outfitted with a port for chemotherapy infusions, lost my hair, and dealt with how those toxic treatments completely sap your energy.\n\nAnd yet, even after all the treatment was over, doctors were still finding more cancer in my body. They did one more major surgery, put in another temporary colostomy bag, and tried a new kind of chemotherapy. Six more months of treatment. The cancer still wasn't eradicated. At this point in time, I'd done two major surgeries and 12 rounds of chemo, and the doctors were still telling me, \"Well, we have to do another surgery and a different type of chemo.\"\n\nMy faith in my oncologist was waning, my frustration mounting. I'm thinking: You keep telling me if I do these things, I'm going to be all right, and it's going to be gone, but it's the same cycle over and over again. I was starting to feel like a test patient.\n\nThat's when, with some help from my football coaches, I sought a second opinion out of state. Finally, I was tested for Lynch syndrome, the genetic condition sometimes called \"cancer family syndrome\" or \"hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer\" because of how it predisposes people to several kinds of cancers, but especially colon cancer, usually in their 40s and 50s.\n\nOnce I had my proper diagnosis, the disease became easier to treat. Oncologists have recently discovered how well Lynch syndrome responds to immunotherapy, where you recruit your own immune system to recognize and fight cancer, sometimes without any need for toxic radiation or chemotherapy.\n\nI went back to my doctor again, who agreed to take a different approach and do immunotherapy this time, with no chemo required. The difference was amazing. Instead of lying in bed all day, exhausted, I was able to live a relatively normal life during this round of treatment. I wouldn't say my energy was 100%, but maybe 80%, which is a really major improvement from life during chemo.\n\nI not only felt better, but I was also getting better. Doctors were able to stop my immunotherapy treatments completely in mid-2024, and I've been all clear since then.\n\nI still get scans about every three months. I know I'll have to be vigilant; my condition puts me at a lifelong higher risk of developing cancer because the mutations that are built into my DNA make it easier for the disease to sprout up.\n\nSchool was my much-needed dose of normalcy through all of the cancer treatment. I told myself I was still going to graduate on time, even if I couldn't be an athlete. My doctors suggested taking a break to heal, and while I understood where they were coming from, I just knew for my own mental health I had to maintain at least some of the \"normal\" things in life while I was a cancer patient. It helped me stay motivated, knowing that at least I could still graduate on time, even if I couldn't play football.\n\nI also kept on working out, getting in regular exercise throughout my treatments. Even when I was getting chemotherapy infusions, I'd strap on a bag to let the chemo drip into me while I moved around, and head to the track for three to five miles of walking. Some days I could only walk very slowly, others it was a brisk pace, depending on my energy. I think the movement really helped manage the side effects, making them milder. Even though I did have some symptoms, and chemo was rough, I felt like keeping my body active and getting that blood flowing and moving around was so beneficial.\n\nAfter two years off the field, with a clean bill of health, I returned to the football team my senior year. It felt good to be back on the field, but my body was not the same anymore.\n\nI have issues with neuropathy, a type of treatment-related nerve damage that makes my hands and feet tingle and go numb. This makes me hyper-sensitive to cold temperatures, making it hard to drive a car when it's cold out or even open up the freezer and pull something out. It's kind of hard to catch a football when you can't really feel your hands, or run when your feet are numb. Eventually, I decided it was time to quit the sport I love, but it felt good doing it on my own terms, and playing for one last season.\n\nI still work out almost every day, but it's not the same as having a team sport. I've started some personal training, training people who were inspired by how well I recovered and how much muscle I was able to build back after my treatments.\n\nI have also changed my diet. After living with a colostomy bag a few times and seeing exactly what comes out of your body after you eat, you start to think about food differently. Some of that stuff is not being digested at all, especially the artificial colors in brightly colored cereals. I don't eat as much junk food or cereal as I used to, in part because seeing those bright blue, purple, and green colors coming out of my body scared me straight. I try to stick to a diet that's good for muscle building and longevity, mainly focusing on lean proteins like chicken and fish, plus lots of leafy greens, with room for a little bit of red meat now and then to keep my iron levels up, but not as much as I used to eat.\n\nI hope my story can be helpful to others going through cancer treatment. I have run a few clothing drives, and donate to my local hospital just so cancer patients like me can have snacks and blankets, comfortable stuff while they're waiting around.\n\nI know how it can feel when your family is going through such a hard time. It's always good to have somebody see you, someone who has experienced it, to help you get through a tough time.",

    "fullText": "The Fallout episode this week also depicted an important event from a beloved DLC.\n\n on January 7, 2026 at 12:00AM PST\n\nSpoilers for this week's episode of Fallout to follow.\n\nThis week’s episode of Fallout was an explosive one. Between Lucy (Ella Purnell) and Cooper (Walton Goggins) finally arriving in New Vegas, Maximus (Aaron Moten) causing conflict within the Brotherhood of Steel, and Vault 31 struggling to survive without their waterchip, there was no shortage of exciting events. With exciting events come easter eggs and deeper ties to the Fallout video games that are a treat for new and returning fans. Let's take a look at some of this week’s easter eggs as the show arrives in the City of Sin.\n\nThis week’s episode began with a pre-war flashback depicting Cooper fighting on the Alaskan front. In Fallout lore, Alaska was occupied by Communist Chinese forces and fought the United States over control of Anchorage. The liberation of Anchorage was most famously depicted in the Operation: Anchorage DLC for Fallout 3, which saw the player character entering a simulation to relive the historical battle.\n\nThe Alaska flashback also depicts the first time the United States deployed the T-45 power armor, which helped to aid their victory against the Chinese forces. Power armor ends up becoming the main tool of the Brotherhood of Steel after Roger Maxson left the United States army to form the organization, but longtime fans will also recognize the T-45 model of the armor as the centerpiece on the cover of the original 1997 Fallout game.\n\nWhen Lucy recovers we learn that she was being pumped up with Buffout, a chem from the video games that provides a boost to strength stats and is essentially a powerful, in-world steroid. Like many other chems in the games, Buffout becomes addictive after prolonged use and leads to negative stat effects unless the player keeps using it regularly or goes many in-game days without use. With no time on her side, Lucy has to keep using Buffout or face negative repercussions from her addiction.\n\nThroughout the episode--particularly whenever they run into trouble on The Strip--Cooper suggests that they take a detour to Freeside to either avoid combat or learn information. Players of Fallout: New Vegas will recognize Freeside as one of the last locations they can visit before they reach their destination of The Strip. Overrun by gangs such as The Kings (who appear in this episode as ghouls), Freeside is inspired by the real-life location of Fremont Street. The real world location is disconnected from the Las Vegas Strip and offers cheaper (and sometimes more rambunctious) entertainment options for travelers and tourists.\n\nWhile Lucy is high on Buffout and gets into a shootout with The Kings, her final kill is showcased with a slow motion gory headshot that is very cinematically pleasing. This shot replicates a critical headshot in V.A.T.S. from the Fallout video games. The Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System allows players to slow down or freeze time to line up gory head and body shots and was introduced in Fallout 3 as a way of replicating the turn-based combat of the first two entries.\n\nThe credits of the episode depict an abandoned Camp McCarran inside a derelict Las Vegas International Airport. In Fallout: New Vegas Camp McCarran was the largest active military base of the New California Republic and served as the NCR’s stronghold in their activities against Caesar’s Legion. With the NCR all but non-existent in the Mojave Wasteland as of late, it’s not surprising to see Camp McCarran has met the fate it has.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

It's taken a couple of years to get us back there, but if somebody's going to come along and wants to invest then they need to have an upside and I believe we have a lot of upside at Exeter.\"",

A glimmer amid the wreckage?\n\nJoe Root's long-awaited centuries in Australia were special but we knew he was good.\n\nThe Melbourne win was something but that was a dead rubber.\n\nIn scoring his first Test century on day four of the fifth Ashes Test, a sensational 142 not out that kept England alive for another day, Jacob Bethell provided the moment England fans can cling to when this Ashes defeat is all said and done, whether 4-1, 3-1 or 3-2.\n\nThere is a future. And it comes from an elegant left-hander with a flash of peroxide.\n\n\"I've seen some hundreds but I don't think I've seen many better debut hundreds than that,\" said former England captain Sir Alastair Cook.",

    "fullText": "Michael Carrick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer have emerged as the frontrunners to become Manchester United's caretaker manager until the end of the season.\n\nThe former players, who have both previously managed United, are set for face-to-face talks with the club's leadership.\n\nIt is not out of the question the pair could also work together because Carrick was a significant part of Solskjaer's coaching team when he replaced Jose Mourinho at Old Trafford in 2018.\n\nDarren Fletcher, United's current Under-18s coach, who has also been spoken to about the job, will continue as interim manager until a caretaker is appointed. The former midfielder takes charge of his first match on Wednesday, when United visit Burnley (20:15 GMT) in the Premier League.\n\nRuud van Nistelrooy, the ex-United striker, is also believed to be a contender.\n\nAmorim was sacked on Monday after a turbulent 14 months in charge.\n\nUnited plan on naming a permanent successor for Amorim in the summer.\n\nOne player has told BBC Sport they felt it was possible the role could be shared by more than one of the contenders, or that Fletcher could even stay in the job until the end of the season if the next two matches are positive.\n\nSolskjaer initially took charge in a similar fashion when United sacked Mourinho in 2018, and he subsequently became the full-time manager for three years before he was sacked in November 2021.\n\nCarrick then had a three-game stint as temporary boss after Solskjaer's dismissal before he left the club in December 2021.\n\nThe former England midfielder has been out of work since he was sacked by Championship club Middlesbrough last June after after two-and-a-half years in charge.\n\nSolskjaer was sacked by Turkish club Besiktas in August.\n\nCrystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner and former Brighton boss Roberto de Zerbi - now at Marseille - are understood to be early contenders for the full-time job.\n\nGlasner, who won the FA Cup with the Eagles last season, was asked about the link during his news conference on Tuesday.\n\nHe said: \"I am Crystal Palace manager and it makes no sense for you to ask me any more questions about it.\"",

    "fullText": "Head coach Brendon McCullum and director of cricket Rob Key will be given the chance to stay on and show they can improve the England set-up, despite the Ashes defeat in Australia.\n\nMcCullum and Key have come under scrutiny after England surrendered the series with losses in the opening three Tests of the best-of-five series.\n\nBoth men and Test captain Ben Stokes have expressed a desire to remain in their positions – McCullum and Stokes have contracts with England until after the home Ashes in 2027.\n\nAnd the management of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) are not minded to impose the sweeping changes that often follow Ashes defeats down under.\n\nAny decision to remove 44-year-old McCullum in particular would have been complicated by the T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka and India, beginning in February.\n\nInstead, the future of the hierarchy now seems to rest on their willingness to accept the need for change and their ability to enact it.\n\nHow long they are given to make alterations and improve results is unclear. A poor World Cup would increase pressure, then England's next Test is against New Zealand in June.\n\nThe scope for what could be changed is also broad. So much criticism of this England regime has centred on the culture New Zealander McCullum has created, including preparation, training methods and an apparent lack of accountability for mistakes made on the field.\n\nEngland's off-field activities have also been questioned on this tour. Time playing golf and the amount of drinking done on a holiday in Noosa between the second and third Tests have come into focus.\n\n\"I have no problem with cricketers playing golf but this team has been loose on this tour,\" former England captain Michael Vaughan told the Test Match Special podcast.\n\n\"They need to sharpen up. The management needs to accept that it needs to change slightly.\"\n\nUnder Key, McCullum and Stokes, England have stripped back their preparation for overseas tours.\n\nEngland won the opening Test on their five previous tours before the Ashes. In Australia they played only one warm-up match, against England Lions at a club ground in Perth. McCullum and Key have both subsequently admitted that mistakes were made in England's preparation.",

    "description": "\"The jobs this cycle all lack QBs like normal so he's definitely the top QB and offense available for any coach,\" one NFC exec told Yahoo Sports. An AFC assistant added: \"Any scheme fits him.\"",
    "fullText": "When the Cleveland Browns and Las Vegas Raiders interview head coaches in the coming weeks, they know the most important question they must answer: How will we identify and develop a young quarterback?\n\nWhen the New York Giants and Tennessee Titans interview head coaches, they, too, know the crux: First-round quarterbacks Jaxson Dart and Cam Ward need molding and development. The quarterback hopeful for each club is in the house. But how will he grow?\n\nShakeup at the top of the Atlanta Falcons and Arizona Cardinals will similarly require answers on a position with major question marks in 2026 and beyond.\n\nThese answers need not all come via offensive head coaches during a hiring cycle riper with defensive candidates than offensive. And in many successful franchises, including the reigning Super Bowl champions, the head coach’s primary responsibility is not to call offensive plays.\n\nBut when teams front young quarterbacks or face questions at quarterback, the pressure to find the offensive panacea sharpens. Coaching searches often skew accordingly.\n\nSo the Baltimore Ravens hold a clear advantage.\n\nBecause as they announced Tuesday night that 18-year head coach John Harbaugh was “relieved of his duties,” the Ravens are the lone team currently looking for a head coach that is not simultaneously searching to clarify their answer at quarterback.\n\nRecruiting coaches while two-time MVP Lamar Jackson is under contract is a luxury.\n\nSure, plenty will argue that just as the Ravens become the most attractive of seven NFL openings and counting, Harbaugh immediately became the most attractive candidate when he hit the market. That doesn’t mean the decision should be baffling. With a Super Bowl-winning coach and an MVP-winning quarterback, it should not be surprising if each believes he has the answers to future success. And if those answers don’t align, a time comes for a change.\n\nBut as the Ravens look for a coach who will end their 13-year Super Bowl drought, they won’t need as strong an emphasis on developing a quarterback.\n\n[Get more Ravens news: Baltimore team feed]\n\nThat could allow them, should they want, to select the best overall candidate first. Their ceiling will immediately be high.\n\n“We have so much talent on this team, and it's just disappointing that we're not able to be the team that's able to execute and win games when we need to win games,” fullback Patrick Ricard said this week. “As long as we have Lamar Jackson, I feel like this team can win a Super Bowl.”\n\nA minority of coaches and executives across the league will argue that a coach in the Shanahan and McVay systems may prefer a more in-structure passer to build their offense around.\n\nBut more often, as the surprise of Harbaugh’s dismissal hit Tuesday, league voices understood the new pecking order of openings.\n\n“The jobs this cycle all lack QBs like normal so he’s definitely the top QB and offense available for any coach,” one NFC executive told Yahoo Sports.\n\nAn AFC assistant added of Jackson: “Any scheme fits him.”\n\nJackson has shown that in eight seasons since the Ravens selected him with the 32nd pick of the 2018 NFL Draft. He’s earned four Pro Bowl berths, three All-Pro honors and two MVP awards while winning 76 of 107 regular-season starts.\n\nIn aggregate, Jackson has completed 64.8% of his passes for 22,608 yards and 187 passing touchdowns to 56 interceptions. His 102.2 career passer rating and 8.25 air yards per attempt currently hold the all-time career records, per Pro Football Reference.\n\nAnd those numbers don’t even include Jackson’s additional 6,522 yards and 35 touchdowns rushing.\n\nHis health has been inconsistent at times, Jackson most recently missing four games and about half of another this season with hamstring and back injuries. But while healthy, he thrived. Consider his Week 18 return from a back injury in Pittsburgh with the AFC North title on the line. While the Ravens lost on a walk-off missed field-goal attempt Sunday night, Jackson completed 11 of 18 passes for 238 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nHe activated another level in the fourth quarter, with 50- and 64-yard go-ahead touchdown passes to receiver Zay Flowers. The first came despite two defenders seeming to have Jackson wrapped up. Jackson was unfazed.\n\nInsane sack escape and 50-yard TD from Lamar Jackson. \n\nRavens 17, Steelers 13.pic.twitter.com/mgwAU6YIQG\n\n— Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) January 5, 2026\n\n“Shoot — I cut a nose guard loose, and he somehow slipped out of it and threw the ball [50] yards for a touchdown,” center Tyler Linderbaum said. “That's the kind of ability he has. So, he’s fun to play for. [He’s an] ultra competitor, and any time that ball is snapped to him, and it's in his hands, you know something electrifying can happen.”\n\n“The most electrifying player there is in this game.”\n\nAs reports of tension between Jackson and Harbaugh built this season, Jackson was asked last Thursday if he had a good relationship with Harbaugh.\n\n“Yes, I believe so,” he said. “I don’t know where the noise came from. I don’t know where the noise came from.”\n\nAfter the Ravens’ 26-24 loss Sunday, Jackson was asked about Harbaugh again.\n\nDid he want to see Harbaugh as his head coach next season?\n\n“You’re asking me about next year,” Jackson said. “I’m so caught up in what just happened tonight. I can't focus on that right now, I just told you. Like he asked me, ‘Are you stunned?’\n\n“I’m stunned right now, and I'm still trying to process what's going on. I know we lost, but what the ... you know?”\n\nSure, the emotions of the season’s sudden ending were fresh as Jackson’s Herculean fourth quarter wasn’t enough to advance to a sixth playoff berth in eight years. But Jackson was not the first player to receive a question about his coach’s future at season’s end. He would not have been the first to endorse a leader after a loss, especially one 18 years into his tenure with the organization with a Lombardi Trophy to his name and an AFC championship game berth in partnership with Jackson.\n\nHarbaugh issued his own statement, curiously including a smiley-face emoji as he said goodbye with “disappointment certainly, but more with GRATITUDE & APPRECIATION.”\n\nIs John Harbaugh the first NFL coach to include a smiley face in his statement about being fired? pic.twitter.com/NhHouUIL0C\n\n— Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) January 6, 2026\n\nThe Ravens' coaching search, as team owner Steve Bisciotti said in a statement, begins. Their ability to move quickly on top defensive candidates including the Los Angeles Chargers’ Jesse Minter, Los Angeles Rams’ Chris Shula and Houston Texans’ Matt Burke could prove to be an asset.\n\n“That’s a dream backfield to have Lamar and Derrick [Henry] and to play with those guys,” Ricard said. “I feel like, as long as they're here, this team has a shot — no matter who else is playing.”",

    "description": "The John R.",
    "fullText": "The John R. Wooden Award will celebrate it's 50th anniversary this season. Leading up to the award ceremony on April 10, 2026, The Sporting Tribune in partnership with the Wooden Award and the Los Angeles Athletic Club will highlight past winners of the Wooden Award and the Legends of Coaching Award.\n\nEvery blue moon a player comes along that will have you believing that every time he takes a shot its going in. “Jimmer” Fredette was one of those players.\n\nJames Taft Fredette, nicknamed “Jimmer” by his mother, was born February 25, 1989 in Glens Falls, New York, and was drawn to sports at a very early age. Older brother TJ helped “Jimmer” hone his skills early on as the two regularly played with TJ’s older friends in the family's backyard. \"He was the most determined, competitive four-year-old I had ever seen,” the elder once recalled.\n\nFredette was ranked among the nation's top high school shooting guards by ESPN.com and became Glens Falls High School's all-time leading scorer, ranking 16th on New York's all-time scoring list with 2,404 points.  He was named First-Team All-State by the New York State Sportswriters Association and the Times Union as a junior and senior, and in his senior season he led the then-Indians to a 25–2 record and a Class A State Championship game appearance.\n\nDespite his high school accolades Fredette, in many ways, went unnoticed by many of the nation’s top basketball programs, receiving a modest 12 scholarship offers before choosing to attend his sister's alma mater, BYU in Provo, Utah.\n\nAs a true freshman he played in all 35 games for the Cougars, helping them post a 27–8 record and capture the Mountain West Conference regular season title. He averaged 18.5 minutes per contest, and was the team's fifth-leading scorer at 7.0 points, while adding 1.7 assists and 1.1 rebounds per game.\n\nFredette played in all 33 games his sophomore season (2008-09), starting 32 of them, but this time around he was second on the team in scoring (16.2), three-point field goal percentage (.382), three-point makes (52), and free throw percentage (.847), and first in steals (1.5) and assists (4.1). Rightly so, his productivity earned him First-Team All-Mountain West Conference honors.\n\nAfter a stellar junior year that saw him break the MWC Tournament overall single-game and single game free throw records, Fredette considered forgoing his senior season and entering the NBA Draft. Expected to be picked late in the first round, however, he decided to stay at BYU and play his fourth year.\n\nHe posted two dozen 30-point, six 40-point, and a career-high 52 point night (senior year) in his four years with the Cougars, and for his overall body of work, Fredette was named the unanimous 2011 National Player of the Year, earning the coveted John R. Wooden Award. He was also took home the Best Male College Athlete ESPY Award that year.\n\nIn March 2011 Fredette broke BYU's career scoring record, previously held by Danny Ainge, in the semifinals of the Mountain West Conference Championship Tournament. He also set the school's single-game scoring record with a career-high 52-point performance against New Mexico, whom the Cougars fell to twice during the regular season.\n\nIn addition to claiming conference Player of the Year honors he was also among the final ten candidates for the Bob Cousy Award, given to college basketball’s top point guard.\n\n“I loved my time at BYU,” he once said of his four years in Provo. “It was an unbelievable experience with the fans, and the people that I have met, I have lifelong relationships still.”\n\nHe was subsequently selected with the 10th overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft by the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nFredette played for several NBA and NBA Development League teams, as well as internationally. He was the CBA Most Valuable Player in 2017, and was a member of the Greek Basketball League's championship team in 2020.\n\nCurrently Fredette is Managing Director for USA Basketball’s 3x3 National Team. He began competing in 3x3 basketball in 2022 and won two gold medals and one silver in international play. In 2024, Fredette represented Team USA at the 2024 Summer Olympics as a member of the first USA Basketball 3x3 Men's National Team to compete at the Olympics.\n\nAt the end of the day, “Jimmermania” (in its heyday) rivaled that of “Linsanity,” and Fredette will deservedly be remembered for it.\n\nIn his own words, “Basketball will come and go, but the person you are will always remain.”",

    "description": "Texas A&M beat Auburn 90-88 on Tuesday night after a review determined that a buzzer-beater didn't quite get off in time.",
    "fullText": "KeShawn Murphy thought he had hit a ridiculous deep buzzer-beater to lift Auburn past Texas A&M on Tuesday night.\n\nMurphy, with Auburn down by two points, caught an inbounds pass with just 0.6 seconds left on the clock, turned and fired. His shot was perfect, and sparked a massive celebration at Neville Arena. The shot looked like it was one of the first truly great buzzer-beaters of the college basketball season, several months before March even hit.\n\nBut unfortunately for Murphy and the Tigers, a review from the officials determined that the release was just a little too late. Murphy didn’t get the shot off in time, and the points were called off. That gave the Aggies the 90-88 road win, and left them celebrating in front of a stunned arena instead.\n\nWILD ENDING 🤯 \n\nThis supposed buzzer-beater from Auburn was overturned after review to give Texas A&M the win. pic.twitter.com/oxjZEHlWGH\n\n— SEC Network (@SECNetwork) January 7, 2026\n\n\"I don't have a clear understanding still,\" Auburn coach Steven Pearl said, via WSFA12's Rosie Langello-Hodgens. \"I still gotta gather more information and get an understanding as to what their determination was ... Just from the angles that I saw, it looked like the ball was out of his hands on the red light, on the scoreboard that we were looking at. But I would imagine that they had a different angle they were looking at to determine the ball wasn't out of his hands.\"\n\nPearl had a conversation with the SEC after the game, and he was seen meeting with athletic director John Cohen and officials on the court well after speaking with reporters.\n\nTexas A&M rallied from a 16-point hole to grab the win over the Tigers, which got them to 12-3 on the season and kept them a perfect 2-0 in SEC play. Pop Isaacs led the way with 21 points off the bench after he shot 7-of-12 from the field, and Jacari Lane added 17 points and seven rebounds. The Aggies have now won five straight entering Saturday's game with Oklahoma.\n\nKeyshawn Hall led Auburn with 32 points and 12 rebounds in the loss, and Kevin Overton finished with 16 points. Murphy had eight points and eight rebounds. The Tigers have now lost four of their last six, and fell to 9-6 on the season — which is the first under Pearl, who took over for his father, longtime coach Bruce Pearl, this past offseason. They’ll head into Saturday’s game with No. 15 Arkansas without an SEC win looking to avoid what would be the program’s first three-game losing skid since 2023.",

    "description": "Utah fell to No. 1 Arizona in its conference opener; can the Utes win at Colorado?",
    "fullText": "University of Utah basketball coach Alex Jensen has consistently reminded his players to “control what you can control” in his first season leading the program he once starred for.\n\nDon’t let the results halt the progression — or let outside factors become a deterrent to development.\n\nThat applies to their latest effort, when the Runnin’ Utes lost by 19 to No. 1 Arizona last Saturday in their Big 12 opener.\n\nThe Wildcats stormed out to a 14-2 lead, then used their balance to overwhelm Utah.\n\nThe Utes (8-6, 0-1 Big 12) had their moments — like when they were able to fight back from an early 17-point hole and cut their deficit to single digits four times in the first half — before falling in a game where they were heavy underdogs.\n\n“There were a lot of things myself and our team could learn from them, because they scored 97 points, and — I said this after the game — but they didn’t have a guy over 20 (points). You never saw them celebrate, get too high or too low. Very professional. You know, give credit to them,” Jensen said.\n\n“Playing a team as good as that, I think it helped us emphasize what we’ve been trying to get across to them all along, that control what you can control. And there’s mistakes, whether you play Arizona or anybody, that you shouldn’t make.”\n\nThe experience was valuable for a Utah team with 12 newcomers — only junior forward Keanu Dawes played for the Utes in Big 12 action last season. Fifth-year forward James Okonkwo also has experience in the league — he started out his college career at West Virginia.\n\nFor freshmen like forward Kendyl Sanders, guard Obomate Abbey and forward Ibi Traore, it was their first real taste of the physicality that the conference is known for.\n\nIt wasn’t their first taste of major conference ball — the Utes had multiple nonconference games against teams from the SEC, ACC and Big Ten — but it gave Utah its first glance of what the 18-game conference grind will be like.\n\n”It’s just very physical,” Sanders said of Big 12 play. “I’d say it’s probably the best basketball team we ever played — just experience, the physicality, the shots they take, how hard they were on the floor. I mean, it was a lot, but I think I’m ready for it. I’m excited for the (rest of) the season.”\n\nJensen was complimentary of the kind of program that Wildcats coach Tommy Lloyd has built in Arizona. Not only do the Wildcats not have to rely on any one player — Arizona has one of the most balanced rosters in the country — they also have three starting freshmen who contribute heavily on a nightly basis.\n\n“I think it’s really valuable for our freshmen to get the experience, because I think the fastest way to improve is to play basketball. … (Arizona does) a great job of blending (together), start three freshmen, and give them credit, all those guys play well together,” Jensen said.\n\nFor Utah, who’s had some injury issues that have impacted their rotation, the hope is that the challenges will pay off in the long run.\n\n“For us, you’d love to have the eight-, nine-man rotation and stay healthy and have a couple young guys you bring up,” Jensen said. “With injuries and other things, we are doing things we necessarily hadn’t planned on. But again, I think everybody’s trying to figure out the best way to build their roster.”\n\nFortunately for Utah, the next game isn’t against a top-25 program. On Wednesday, the Utes will face Colorado (11-3, 1-0 Big 12), who is coming off a six-point road win over Arizona State to start Big 12 play.\n\nThe Buffaloes, to a lesser extent than Arizona, are efficient on offense — they average 86.6 points per game. Colorado has five players who average double-figures, paced by guard Isaiah Johnson (15.9 points, 3.0 rebounds, 2.4 assists per game) and Barrington Hargress (13.6 points, 4.8 assists).\n\nDefensively, the Utes and Buffaloes are averaging similar numbers. Colorado is 14th in the Big 12 in scoring defense, giving up 78.2 points per game. Utah is one spot behind, allowing 79.8 points per contest.\n\n“They’re well-coached. They’re big, they’re versatile. They have bigs that can handle the ball and they can initiate the offense. They’ll throw a little twist in, but they’re in every game,” Jensen said.\n\nFor Jensen and his team, though, the focus isn’t as much on what the opponent does well. It’s on focusing each day as the season progresses and helping the players develop — not just for this season, but for the future.\n\nAnd if that formula goes well, it could end in victory — like it did in their first win over a major conference opponent, Ole Miss, back in November.\n\n“It goes back to us and the things that we can control — playing with the pass, not getting beat in transition or on the boards, and I think we’ll have a really good chance. And then, limit the turnovers. Sounds simple, repetitive, but that’s it,” Jensen said.\n\nUtah, which has a dearth of front-court depth, is adding a 6-foot-10 walk-on center to the roster.\n\nColin McHaney joins the program as a midseason addition, as a potential option to add some minutes in the post when/if he gets up to speed.\n\nMcHaney hails from Milton, Georgia, where he played for Milton High and Blessed Trinity Catholic High. The past two years, he’s been a part of a region championship team, and as a sophomore, he helped lead Blessed Trinity Catholic High to the state quarterfinals.",

    "fullText": "Get German Football News coverage of the Bundesliga players participating in the 2025 AFCON returns! In this piece, we’ll be taking a look at the 11 Bundesliga professionals still active as the African continental championship enters the quarterfinal phase. There’s some catching up to do as we chronicle each player’s progress through the tournament.\n\nGerman football is represented in six of the eight nations still alive in the competition. Algeria, Cote d’Ivoire, Cameroon, Morocco, Senegal, and Mali all have Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga players chasing the continental crown. Only Egypt and Nigeria don’t feature German footballing representatives this time around.\n\nFor Africa fans, the pre-Christmas AFCON has taken some getting used to. The tourney nevertheless provided us with plenty of great football and intriguing storylines. Attendance figures have been wonderfully pleasing, even more so after it was revealed that fans are being allowed in free-of-charge after kickoff.\n\nMost of us Africa lovers find ourselves saddened by the news that, after the next two AFCONs in 2027 and 2028, this awesome competition will only be held every four years. That’s all the more reason for us to celebrate what we have while it lasts.\n\nThe 2019 AFCON Champions are through to the quarters after besting Samuel Essende’s Congo DR 1-0 in added extra time during the Round-of-16. All four Algerian Bundesliga representatives played important roles in their team’s successful tournament thus far. Unsurprisingly enough, Bayer 04 Leverkusen jewel Ibrahim Maza proved the brightest of the desert nations lights. Maza struck twice during the group phase and earned man-of-the-match honors in the one group stage fixture in which he didn’t score.\n\nVladimir Petkovic’s north Africans now prepare to face Nigeria’s famous “Super Eagles” on Saturday in what shapes up to be an “instant classic”. Like Algeria, Nigeria steamrolled through the group phase on maximum points. The Nigerians (sadly devoid of any Bundesliga representatives this year) knocked out Stanley Ratifo’s Mozambique 4-0 in their Round-of-16 fixture. Former Bundesliga professionals Ademola Lookman (Leipzig) and Victor Osimhen (Wolfsburg) have both turned in beastly tournaments.\n\nThree goals apiece for Lookman and Osimhen!\n\nMaza didn’t start in the initial group stage fixture against Sudan, but did relieve Bundesliga colleague Fares Chaïbi directly at the half-hour-mark. The Berlin-native ended up scoring the 3-0 in the 85th minute. Though he neither scored a goal nor registered an assist in the narrow Round Two 1-0 victory over Burkina Faso, Maza directed the Algerian attack from the No. 10 slot. His four shots and four assisted shots earned him the man-of-the-match honors.\n\nMaza was genuinely unlucky not to score after out-deking his Leverkusen teammate Edmond Tapsoba in the 67th-minute and forcing a fantastic save out of Burkinabé keeper Herve Koffi. Maza revealed that he and Tapsoba prepared for some direct duels beforehand whilst speaking at the post-match press conference. The 20-year-old also lamented that he couldn’t turn his many chances into another goal.\n\nAll of that mattered little as Maza’s team officially booked passage to the knockouts with the win. Maza again worked the ten slot in the Round Three encounter against Equatorial Guinea. Just like in the first match, Maza netted the 3-0. This time, Petkovic’s squad went three goals up much earlier. Maza effectively wrapped matters up with his 32nd minute strike. The German-Algerian prodigy was subbed off early after another excellent start.\n\nIn the recently completed Round-of-16 win, Maza started as a striker alongside Mohamed Amoura in a 4-4-2. A decent 83-minute-shift saw him get two efforts on target. In a very tight affair, Maza produced the best chance of the entire first half. Unfortunately, his finish went wide of the mark in the 43rd-minute. An effort just before being subbed off in the 83rd was more harmless.\n\nChaïbi has featured in all four fixtures and started three. The SGE professional initially worked as a ten until Maza took over the position. Petkovic placed Chaïbi on the left flank beside Maza in the third group stage match. The placement worked perfectly as Maza set up Chaïbi for the 2-0 in the 25th minute. Working behind Maza in the 4-4-2 in the Congo DR knockout match, Chaïbi remained more inconspicuous.\n\nThe 23-year-old still cropped up in the 111th minute, testing Congo DR keeper Lionel Mpasi with an effort from the center. Chaïbi’s shot appeared to be the last bit of action in the match before Algeria’s Adil Boulbina averted a penalty shootout with a dramatic late winner in the 119th. Those who haven’t caught Boulbina’s powerful finish yet are advised to do so.\n\nThe resurgent BVB professional has absolutely done his job in three starts in which he went the full distance. Petkovic rested Bensebaini in the third group stage fixture against Equatorial Guinea; which happened to be the only match in which Algeria conceded a goal. Bensebaini remained especially strong in the air throughout the group phase, not losing a single aerial duel in his two 90-minute shifts. One can’t argue with three clean sheets.\n\nBensebaini was among the workhorses who kept the scoreline level against Congo DR. He contested a total of 28 duels on the ground and in the air. Over the course of 120 minutes, he accrued 99 touches and connected with 84 percent of his 77 passes. Dortmund will surely be keen to welcome Bensebaini back in this form, especially as they continue to beat back Chelsea’s loan recall right on Aarón Anselmino.\n\nWolfsburg’s leading scorer has registered an assist on one of Riyad Mahrez’s three tournament goals. He hasn’t scored himself yet, but has been very effective. The 25-year-old kept active offensively in all three of the matches in which he’s featured. Amoura came close to scoring with some of his seven tournament efforts on target and looked especially compelling working alongside Maza in the 4-4-2 Petkovic deployed in the last match.\n\nAs forecast in our GGFN preview section the two Bundesliga sensations on the Cote d’Ivoire roster are helping the 2015 and 2023 AFCON champs storm through this tournament. Emerse Faé’s Ivorians have Leipzig phenom Yan Diomande and Hoffenheim tactical wizard Bazoumana Touré directly to thank for their quarterfinal berth. The Bundesliga duo both scored in Cote d’Ivoire’s surprising 3-0 Round-of-16 win over a very strong Burkina Faso side.\n\nThe defending champs are set for a quarterfinal showdown with AFCON record champs Egypt on Saturday. The task shall prove a difficult one as Egypt’s former Bundesliga star Omar Marmoush is having an excellent tournament. Egypt stormed past Steve Mounie’s Benin with a 3-1 victory in added extra time to punch their ticket to the knockouts.\n\nIt’s just getting ridiculous. Why expend more words on this über-talented youngster with an amazing story? Don’t read about him. Watch him! Diomande started three of his nation’s four tournament fixtures, going the full 90 minutes in the first two rounds. He worked his socks off in the Round One 1-0 win over Mozambique on the left-hand-side of a 4-3-3. In the crazy 1-1 draw with Cameroon in Round Two, Diomande barely missed out on an assisted goal.\n\nInitially rested in the final group stage fixture against Gabon, Diomande came on very late during one of the craziest matches of the tournament. Cote d’Ivoire were trailing Gabon 1-2 when Diomande entered proceedings in the 82nd minute. Thanks in large part to his boundless energy (12 touches, four long dribbles, and five ground duel wins), the team was able to score two goals in the final six minutes and pull out 3-2 victory.\n\nDiomande and his right flank partner Amad Diallo Traoré of Manchester United have evolved into an unstoppable force as the competition progressed. Diomande assisted on Amad’s 1-0 in the 20th-minute of the Burkina Faso Round-of-16 encounter just completed this evening. Amad then returned the favor on Diomande’s 2-0 in 32nd-minute. The Burkinabé’s attempted to fight back bravely, but couldn’t get past the early insurmountable lead.\n\nOne of the best Bundesliga additions of the 2025 calendar year is simply having a rollicking tournament is simply having a rollicking tournament. Everything about this player glistens. Known as perhaps the most interesting and diverse tactical player in the entire Bundesliga, Touré showcases his skills here. The 19-year-old has only featured twice off the bench in the competition, yet has scored within scant minutes of his introduction on both occasions.\n\nTouré’s second goal of the tournament (this evening) was simply unreal. The fearless teenage talent literally picked up the ball in his own penalty area and sprinted across the entire pitch before supplying a flawless finish. Yowza. Once more, one must insist that the reader stop reading at this point. Go find a video of Touré’s virtuosity! Now!\n\nWe segue to another player whose breakout tournament was easy enough to forecast. The author knew Leverkusen Christian Kofane would light up the Dark Continent’s showpiece….and also stands by his (nonjudgmental) assertion that there’s no possible way that Kofane is only 19-years-old. Kofane has the 2017 AFCON champs kicking some serious ass with goals in his last two games.\n\nKofane scored the crucial 2-0 in Cameroon’s eventual 2-1 Round-of-16 victory over South Africa. The Indomitables now face a stern test in the quarters. Hosts Morocco block their path to the semis. If Kofane can once again prove the deciding factor, we’ll be talking much more about how this mega-talented youngster almost didn’t participate in this completion.\n\nFECAFOOT really pulled off something big here!\n\nAfter not appearing in the opening group stage fixture against Gabon, Kofane was among the subs who came agonizingly close to scoring in the Round Two 1-1 draw against Cote d’Ivoire. Cameroon trainer David Pagou liked what he saw from Kofane in his 17-minute relief shift in the second match and rewarded him with a start against Mozambique in Round Three. Kofane spearheaded the 4-2-3-1, going head-to-head against Chemie Leipzig’s Stanley Ratifo.\n\nCameroon’s ticket to the knockouts wasn’t in the greatest danger when the second half began with the game deadlocked at 1-1. Kofane still lifted his team above an unfortunate own-goal and past a potentially poor Round-of-16 seed with a sickly sweet solo effort on what would prove the match winner in the 55th minute. Serious involvement from Kofane in the Mozambique match! The Leverkusen man was involved in nine scoring chances!\n\nKofane’s second goal in the weekend knockout fixture also drove his team to a 2-1 victory. Kofane turned in another very strong performance in which he accrued way more touches than most center-forwards have business doing. Small wonder Germans absolutely love him. True to the German footballing spirit, Kofane never shies away from working the “deep drops”.\n\nHad a disallowed offside goal in the Cote d’Ivoire match not been disallowed, Kofane would have scored three consecutive 2-1 match-winners. Incredible!  Everyone in the Bundesrepublik remains excited to see where Kofane heads next. Most German footballing media sources aren’t missing the opportunity to re-post coverage of Kofane in his native country. Cameroon buzzes harder than the Bundesrepublik.\n\nWe’re witnessing greatness blossom here!\n\nThings have shaken out a little differently than expected for the hosts, at least with regard to the two Bundesliga players involved. For some reason, Stuttgart gem Bilal El Khannouss only appeared as a substitute during the first two group stage fixtures and sat out the third entirely. Meanwhile, Leverkusen flop Eliesse Ben Seghir has featured more regularly off the bench. There’s word that Ben Seghir struggles with injury, but El Khannouss appears fully fit.\n\nIn any event, after an excellent group phase, Morocco managed to squeak into the quarters with a narrow victory over German favorites Tanzania. El Khannouss’s Lions square off against Kofane’s Lions in a fabulous Friday quarterfinal offering. The hosts have great cause to worry. One anticipates that 120 minutes plus may be required to separate the two teams.\n\nEl Khannouss did exert his influence somewhat in his 14 minutes on the pitch in the tournament opener against Comoros. In a slightly longer shift against Mali in Round Two, the 21-year-old engaged in more duels and recorded an assisted shot on target. Unused in the third group stage, El Khannouss made up for it all with his first start of the competition in the Tanzania match.\n\nWorking on the right-hand-side of a crowded midfield 4-3-3, the Leicester City loanee accrued 88 touches and peeled off a brilliant effort on target in the 52nd-minute. One conjectures that, after such a performance, El Khannouss will start against Cameroon. He looked his usual spry and creative self. Stay tuned!\n\nNot too terribly much to report from the 20-year-old’s three relief shifts. Ben Seghir always entered when the game had already been decided. The only real piece of news concerns the fact that Moroccan trainer Walid Regragui recently stated that Ben Seghir had been struggling with a pubic bone injury for “over three months”. Leverkusen sporting director Simon Rolfes has denied this report.\n\nThe 2021 AFCON champs are indeed looking good after topping their group and easily manhandling Sudan in their Round-of-16 encounter. The “new look” Pape Thiaw Lions face the Malian Eagles in the first quarterfinal match due to kick off on Friday. Current Bayern loanee Nicolas Jackson and former Bayern flop Sadio Mané have both had excellent tournaments.\n\nA brace from Jackson in the opening round victory over Botswana ensured that the Terangans got off to an excellent start. Jackson also looked strong in the Round Two draw against Congo DR and registered an assist in the victory over Sudan. Jackson leads a weird looking 4-1-4-1 that, while at times choppy, succeeds in getting the job done.\n\nWe’ve a problem here. Namely, the fact that it remains common knowledge that Jackson is only in the Bundesliga for a brief stopover. Bayern have proudly bilked Chelsea into what (for them at least) is a low-cost short-term lease. German football lovers find it difficult to really get into the 24-year-old. He’s merely passing through.\n\nThe beloved “Aigles” are one Bundesliga player shorter now that Amadou Haidara’s transfer has been finalized. Mali bested Bundesliga-heavy Tunisia in a draining Round-of-16 penalty shootout on Day One of the knockouts. Eintracht Frankfurt trainer Dino Toppmöller has already confirmed that midfielder Elyes Skhiri will be granted a week’s worth of vacation in order to adequately recover from the ordeal.\n\nThe lone 2. Bundesliga representative of this subset only featured in the Tunisian match in the final ten minutes. Sissoko only managed to get booked and did not take a penalty. Haidara has been more influential for the West Africans in this tournament, as has former Stuttgart loanee El Bilal Touré. The former Bundesliga pro sunk the winning penalty in a shootout in which Augsburg profi Elias Saad was one of only two Tunisians who converted.",

    "fullText": "ST. LOUIS – When the Principia boys basketball team went 31-1 and capped off last season with a state championship it seemed like they had reached their peak, but they were just getting started.\n\nThe Panthers now at 10-1 this season have scheduled national competition on their way into the national spotlight.\n\n“You have to have the right type of mindset and these guys have bought in to each other,” head coach Jay Blossom told Fox 2 on Tuesday.\n\nFrom nationally ranked players to nationally ranked teams, the Panthers haven’t shied away from the competition.\n\n“People didn’t think that we would be ranked number two in the country and I honestly didn’t think we were either,” senior guard Quentin Coleman said.\n\nAccording to MaxPreps, Principia is the second-best high school basketball team in the country. The team played in the City of Palms classic in Florida where they beat previously #1 Wheeler High School.\n\n“So far we have performed at a high level and our name is out there, but when you’re name is out there all that means is that target is a whole lot bigger,” Blossom explained.\n\nThe target may be one of the biggest this weekend as the Panthers feature in the Highland Shootout where they will meet East St. Louis.\n\n“It should be epic,” Blossom said.\n\nIt’ll be a battle of the best small school in St. Louis versus the best big school.\n\n“Most of my family is over in East. St. Louis,” Coleman said. “We’ve been having talks in the group chat.”\n\n“It’s a really hyped-up game and it’s going to be a crazy environment,” junior Kingston Money said.\n\nThe Panthers are eager to grab St. Louis bragging rights but have their eye on an even bigger prize which would be another state championship.\n\n“It’s hard to go back-to-back and that’s what I’m trying to accomplish,” Coleman said. “I feel like I’m a winner and I have to prove that.”",

    "description": "The No. 9-ranked Stars bolstered their schedule and expanded their talent base in an effort to achieve the goal that's eluded them the last two years.",
    "fullText": "LANSING — For Lansing Community College’s women’s basketball program, the previous two seasons were a combination of wonder and winning, building and bonding. The rebirth of the Stars’ program under Megan Hudson has been an awesome story.\n\nBut it’s also twice finished in frustration and heartbreak, back-to-back 25-win seasons ending a win shy of the NJCAA Division II national tournament.\n\nAll you have to do is look at the schedule and the roster this season to know there’s one goal: Get to the national tournament.\n\n“100%. It’s eyes on the prize,” Hudson said, midway through her third season.\n\n“I mean, it’s everything,” said sophomore point guard Claire Tobias, from Holt.\n\nThe Stars are 11-2 entering Wednesday night’s home game against Jackson College (5:30 p.m., Gannon Gymnasium). Jackson beat them in the district championship two years ago. LCC then begins conference play at home Saturday against Glen Oaks Community College (1 p.m., Gannon Gymnasium).\n\nThe LCC men, also off to a good start (9-4), host Mott at 7:30 on Wednesday and Glen Oaks at 3 p.m. Saturday.\n\nThat non-conference record by the LCC women has been earned this season. Hudson challenged her team in ways she hadn’t the first two years — playing three straight ranked teams in three days at a tournament at St. Clair County in November, beating two of them and losing a competitive game to now-No. 2 Illinois Central, then playing at No. 6 Schoolcraft, losing by four, before winning three games at an event in Florida in December, including over No. 12 Parkland.\n\nAll of it has put the Stars firmly on the national radar, ranked No. 9 nationally in the latest poll, which came out Tuesday.\n\nIt’s the respect Hudson has been seeking. “Because I feel the basketball we’re playing is on that level,” she said.\n\n“I have been trying to figure out the formula for national competition, to continue to grow, to get to a space that we can make the national tournament and, when we get there, we can compete nationally,” Hudson continued. “And it was clearly articulated to me that you need to travel to play outside of your region and you have to play ranked teams.”\n\nShe was told that by fellow coaches and, not in so many words, by the NJCAA tournament selection committee, which didn’t give the Stars one of the few at-large bids when they fell to Schoolcraft last March in their district championship game.\n\nHudson also knew that she needed to challenge this particular team early, a squad with 10 freshmen.\n\n“I knew that I had a very young team coming in, a very, very talented young team coming in,” Hudson said, “and that they need to understand what that landscape looks like, and to play the best of the best and to be able to compete at that level.”\n\nHudson’s team still has a local flare to it — Tobias, sophomore post Ashlynn Putman (Mason), redshirt-sophomore Ivana McCollum (Waverly), along with freshmen guards Sophie Klinger (East Lansing) and Jocelyn Kotowicz (St. Johns) are all regular contributors, with Tobias and Putman starting all 13 games.\n\nBut Hudson’s recruiting reach has expanded significantly — to Detroit, Flint, Bay City, Berrien Springs, Kansas, Texas.\n\nThe foundation and culture built the last two seasons has made LCC an attractive destination and the recruiting pitch easier.\n\nFor example, transfer Destiny Ochs, a 5-foot-9 wing from Topeka, Kansas, found LCC on her own, first by poking around the NJCAA website.\n\n“Lansing stood out to me,” Ochs said. “I looked them up, and the school popped out to me. I could tell they're really focused on their education, they looked like they had a good basketball program they were building. And I just looked at their Twitter, too. And I saw that they're committing a lot more girls. It’s more of a diverse team than it was last year. So I was just really interested. I reached out from there.”\n\nHudson emailed her back the next day and the recruitment blossomed.\n\nFreshman power forward and center Aubreona Smith — affectionally known to her teammates as “Smitty” — met Hudson after one of her games at Berrien Springs. There were a number of coaches there to see her, but she and Hudson connected right away.\n\n“She stood out the most to me,” Smith said. “I feel like you should go somewhere you’re wanted and not just be a number.”\n\nShe liked that LCC had a psychology program and felt like home. And, “I like to win.”\n\nThis is no longer just a dream. Nor just a feel-good story. Hudson has something to sell, proof of concept, and can be choosy in who she recruits, as well.\n\nHer first two teams were talented in their own right. This one is deeper — 13 deep regularly.\n\n“I have easily seven different kids that could go off for 20 (points) on any given night,” Hudson said.\n\n“We have so many guards this year, they just love to run,” Tobias added. “We have so many people coming off the bench, if one person's tired, we have another one just as fast. We outrun everyone. I love that feeling, as someone who just loves to push the ball up (the court). … And Smitty coming in, her and Ash (Putman) being our bigs have been great.”\n\nSmith are Putman are part of a balanced scoring attack, with Putman leading the team at 11.3 points per game (an 8.2 rebounds), with Smith at 10.8 (and 7.8 rebounds). Armonie Smith, a 5-9 freshman guard from Flint, averages 11.2 points, with freshman guard Demi Bolton, who played at Ferndale, at 9.1 per game. Tobias averages 7.6 points and team-leading 2.4 assists. Freshman Georgia Kuyers — who followed former LCC star Kara Bartels (now at CMU) from Zeeland West — is averaging 6.7 rebounds in 17.3 minutes. Nine players are averaging 15 minutes or more per game, with Putnam and Tobias the only two over 20.\n\n“I think our athleticism and the fact that we can go so deep in the roster, that's been a little bit different. … That's helped us this year,” Putman said.\n\nAlso helping — even when it doesn’t feel like it: the travel and the schedule.\n\n“I think it was necessary,” Putman said. “It was hard at times, and obviously we dropped a couple (games) to the Illinois (Central) team and Schoolcraft. But playing the high-caliber teams early and getting a feel for that early, I think is beneficial for us when we go down the road and play at regionals and nationals.”\n\n“We we feel like we have figured out the recipe a bit on getting the girls ready for what that's going to feel like in a different way than we have in the past,” Hudson said, “what it feels like to play multiple games back to back, what it feels like to be in high-pressure situations and make better decisions, and you don't get that if you're not playing the best.”\n\nAs the goal has become more focused, Hudson and her staff have tried to make sure this is still an inviting program and an atmosphere that isn’t entirely about winning under pressure. For example, they take dance breaks during workouts — where one player teaches the rest of the team a dance. They give each other verbal flowers after every practice. It’s still a mom and pop operation, too — literally. Hudson’s mother, Pat Feehery, buys the team snacks.\n\nAt the community college level, there’s always a ton a newness. Maintaining culture and leadership comes down to the staff and your sophomores.\n\n“I've been very, very pleased with our (group),” Hudson said, also happy that her team posted a 3.3 first-semester GPA, the highest in her time with the program. “The sophomores have been outstanding, major anchors to what we're doing here. The freshmen, to have the mentality they have, is fun to see.”\n\nContract Graham Couch at gcouch@lsj.com.

    "fullText": "The Vitality Stadium prepares for another high-profile North London visit on Wednesday night as Bournemouth host a stuttering Tottenham Hotspur side.\n\nAndoni Iraola’s men enter the midweek fixture looking to snap an 11-match winless streak. Unfortunately, this represents the longest barren run in the club’s history. Despite a spirited performance against Arsenal, a 3-2 defeat left the Cherries in 15th place.\n\nNow, they face a Tottenham team led by Thomas Frank. However, the manager faces mounting pressure following recent poor results. Recently, a goalless draw at Brentford followed a “painful” 1-1 home stalemate against Sunderland. Currently, the Lilywhites sit 13th, just four points ahead of their hosts. Therefore, Spurs arrive in Bournemouth knowing the high stakes involved. Crucially, dropped points could see them slide down a congested mid-table. This follows Chelsea’s dramatic 1-1 draw at Manchester City on Sunday. Consequently, the European places remain highly competitive.\n\nDate: Wednesday, 7 January 2026\n\nVenue: Vitality Stadium, Bournemouth\n\nLast Meeting: Tottenham Hotspur 0–1 Bournemouth, 30 August 2025\n\nUnfortunately, the Cherries suffered a major blow regarding Justin Kluivert. Specifically, the forward requires surgery on a left knee injury sustained against Arsenal. Now, he joins a lengthy injury list alongside Tyler Adams, Ryan Christie, and Ben Gannon-Doak.\n\nPositively, teenage defender Veljko Milosavljević returned to training. Currently, he ranks as the closest long-term absentee to a return. Surprisingly, Antoine Semenyo expects to be available for his potential final appearance. This comes despite an agreed £65m move to Manchester City.\n\nRegrettably, Thomas Frank confirmed that star winger Mohammed Kudus “most likely” misses out. This follows a thigh injury he sustained against Sunderland. Worryingly, the recent sale of Brennan Johnson compounds this absence. Consequently, Spurs look thin on the right flank.\n\nHowever, Xavi Simons becomes available for selection again. Notably, he returns after serving a three-match suspension. Meanwhile, Dominic Solanke, James Maddison, and Dejan Kulusevski remain out. Additionally, the Africa Cup of Nations claims Yves Bissouma and Pape Matar Sarr.\n\nCurrently, Bournemouth struggle with midweek woes. Specifically, they remain winless in their last seven Premier League games played midweek. However, the Cherries have the chance to complete a historic league double over Tottenham. This follows their 1-0 win in North London earlier this season. Remarkably, they proved themselves as entertainers this term. In fact, they scored at least twice in eight games they failed to win. Finally, teenager Junior Kroupi remains a bright spot. Currently, he leads all teenagers in the league with six goals.\n\nSpurs are also on a 10-match winless midweek run, a record Thomas Frank will be desperate to break. Despite their overall inconsistency, the Lilywhites have shown impressive road resilience, keeping five clean sheets in 10 away games this season—more than they managed in the entirety of the 2024-25 campaign. A tactical shift is evident under Frank; Tottenham are averaging just 9.9 shots per game, the first time they have averaged fewer than 11 per match since records began in 1997.\n\nBournemouth predicted XI: Petrovic; Jimenez, Hill, Senesi, Truffert; Tavernier, Scott; Semenyo, Cook, Brooks; Evanilson\n\nTottenham Hotspur predicted XI: Vicario; Spence, Romero, Van de Ven, Davies; Gray, Bentancur; Simons, Bergvall, Tel; Richarlison\n\nIn the UK, the match will be broadcast live on Sky Sports Golf, with coverage starting at 18:00 GMT ahead of the 19:30 kick-off.\n\nRead more- Semenyo medical booked as Man City eye next transfer target\n\nSee Also- Enzo Maresca breaks silence on Chelsea exit with farewell message\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Two of the Premier League’s surprise European contenders go head-to-head on Wednesday night as seventh-placed Brentford host Sunderland at the Gtech Community Stadium.\n\nThe Bees have defied early-season scepticism under Keith Andrews, mounting a serious challenge for European places following a dominant 4-2 win over Everton. Currently sitting in seventh place with 30 points, they are within touching distance of the top five. They face a Sunderland side that has displayed remarkable resilience under Régis Le Bris.\n\nThe Black Cats occupy eighth place, level on 30 points with their hosts, after securing an “absorbing” 1-1 draw at Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. While Sunderland have held elite opposition like Manchester City and Spurs recently, they travel to West London searching for a clinical edge to turn these impressive stalemates into three points.\n\nDate: Wednesday, 7 January 2026\n\nVenue: Gtech Community Stadium, London\n\nLast Meeting: Sunderland 2–1 Brentford, 30 August 2025, Premier League\n\nKeith Andrews reports no fresh injury concerns following the high-scoring victory at Everton. However, the squad remains depleted by long-term ACL injuries to Fábio Carvalho and Antoni Milambo, while Josh Dasilva is still sidelined. The Bees are also missing Frank Onyeka and Dango Ouattara, who are currently representing their nations at AFCON. Midfielder Mathias Jensen is expected to return to the starting XI after a recent bout of illness.\n\nThe Black Cats face a significant personnel crisis due to AFCON commitments, with six first-team players unavailable: Reinildo Mandava, Noah Sadiki, Chemsdine Talbi, Arthur Masuaku, Bertrand Traoré, and Habib Diarra. Manager Régis Le Bris must also sweat on the fitness of forward Wilson Isidor, who will undergo a late test. Centre-back Daniel Ballard remains a doubt with a recurring ankle issue, while Aji Alese is a long-term absentee.\n\nBrentford have transformed the Gtech Community Stadium into a fortress under Keith Andrews. They have won six of their 10 home league games this season, a record matched only by Mark Warburton in the club’s modern history. Notably, striker Igor Thiago is in electric form, having netted 14 goals in 20 appearances. He is now just one goal shy of the Premier League record for most goals by a Brazilian in a single campaign.\n\nSunderland arrive as the division’s undisputed “stalemate specialists,” having drawn each of their last four matches against top-tier opposition. Should they draw again on Wednesday, they would be the first team to record five consecutive Premier League stalemates since 2021. Despite their injury woes, their defensive organisation remains elite; the Black Cats have conceded goals in both halves in only 5% of their matches this season.\n\nBrentford predicted XI: Kelleher; Kayode, Ajer, Collins, Henry; Yarmoliuk, Janelt; Jensen, Damsgaard, Schade; Thiago\n\nSunderland predicted XI: Roefs; Hume, Mukiele, Alderete, Cirkin; Geertruida, Xhaka; Mayenda, Le Fée, Adingra; Brobbey\n\nIn the UK, the match will be broadcast live on Sky Sports Tennis, with coverage starting at 18:00 GMT.\n\nRead more- Semenyo medical booked as Man City eye next transfer target\n\nSee Also- Enzo Maresca breaks silence on Chelsea exit with farewell message\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Fresh from a dramatic weekend in the Premier League title race, Aston Villa travel to Selhurst Park on Wednesday night knowing that a victory could propel them into second place.\n\nUnai Emery’s side recently dispatched Nottingham Forest 3-1 to keep pace with the leaders, but they face a historical “bogey” ground in South London. Crystal Palace find themselves in a mid-winter slump, having failed to win in their last seven matches, but the Eagles have traditionally dominated Villa at home, winning nine of their 13 Premier League encounters at Selhurst Park.\n\nWith Villa level on points with Manchester City following the Citizens’ recent 1-1 draw with Chelsea, the stakes for this road trip have never been higher for the high-flying Villans. Despite their lofty league position, Villa have conceded 14 goals in their last four games against Palace—as many as they had in the previous 15 meetings combined. Emery will be desperate to break his personal jinx against Oliver Glasner, having never beaten the Austrian in six previous meetings.\n\nDate: Wednesday, 7 January 2026\n\nLast Meeting: Aston Villa 0–3 Crystal Palace, 31 August 2025, Premier League\n\nOliver Glasner’s squad depth is being tested to the limit following a bruising encounter at Newcastle. Nathaniel Clyne (abductor) and Jefferson Lerma (concussion) are both ruled out, joining long-term absentees Daichi Kamada, Daniel Muñoz, and Cheick Doucouré on the sidelines. In a significant boost, Chris Richards is set to return to the matchday squad, though he is likely to start on the bench. The Eagles may hand a full debut to club-record signing Brennan Johnson, who joined from Tottenham last week.\n\nThe visitors are sweating on the fitness of defensive mainstays Tyrone Mings and Pau Torres, with both players facing late tests after lengthy injury layoffs. Midfielders Amadou Onana and Ross Barkley remain unavailable, while Evann Guessand is away at the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast. In their absence, the partnership of Youri Tielemans and Boubacar Kamara is expected to continue in the engine room.\n\nPalace boast incredible home dominance in this fixture, winning six of their last seven home games against Villa. This includes the last three in a row by a combined score of 10-1. Jean-Philippe Mateta remains the man to watch; he has been involved in nine goals against Villa—more than against any other Premier League side. However, the Eagles enter this clash without a win in their last seven outings across all competitions.\n\nVilla have been in sensational form, particularly Ollie Watkins, who has scored six goals since the start of December—more than any other player in the division. A win tonight would take Villa to 45+ points after 21 games for only the third time in their history. Notably, on both previous occasions they reached this milestone (1895-96 and 1898-99), they went on to win the league title.\n\nCrystal Palace predicted XI: Henderson; Canvot, Lacroix, Guéhi; Rodney, Wharton, Hughes, Mitchell; Johnson, Pino; Mateta\n\nAston Villa predicted XI: Martínez; Cash, Konsa, Lindelöf, Maatsen; Kamara, Tielemans; McGinn, Rogers, Buendía; Watkins\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on Sky Sports+. Coverage begins at 18:00 GMT, with the game kicking off at 19:30 GMT.\n\nRead more- Pep Guardiola reacts to Ruben Amorim sacking by Man Utd\n\nSee Also- Two surprise Man Utd candidates emerge as new manager search underway\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Brentford host Sunderland tonight while they aim to cement their place in the top seven and continue their improbable European charge.\n\nKeith Andrews’ side has moved level on 30 points with tonight’s opponents following a clinical 4-2 victory over Everton. The Bees have been formidable at home this season, losing only once in 10 matches at the Gtech. Consequently, confidence is high as they look to exploit a Sunderland side that, while resilient, is currently depleted by international absences.\n\nBrentford are boosted by the news that they sustained no fresh injuries during their high-scoring weekend win. However, Keith Andrews is still without several long-term absentees, including Josh Dasilva, Fábio Carvalho, and Antoni Milambo. Midfielders Frank Onyeka and Dango Ouattara also remain unavailable due to AFCON commitments.\n\nOn a positive note, Mathias Jensen is poised to return to the heart of the midfield after recovering from illness. He is expected to partner Vitaly Janelt and Yehor Yarmoliuk to provide the platform for the Bees’ lethal attack. All eyes will be on Igor Thiago, who is currently averaging a goal every 1.4 games and sits on the cusp of a Premier League goalscoring record for Brazilian players.\n\nBrentford predicted XI: Kelleher; Kayode, Ajer, Collins, Henry; Yarmoliuk, Janelt; Jensen, Damsgaard, Schade; Thiago\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at the Gtech Community Stadium on Wednesday, 7 January 2026.

    "fullText": "After a couple of tough games – mentally and physically – we’re heading to Brentford without too many options to change things up. Will Regis keep faith with the team that played against Spurs, or will we look to freshen things up a little bit? Here’s how I think we’ll line up tonight.\n\nAnother good display by Roefs against Spurs, and he’ll be hoping to add yet another clean sheet to his season’s tally tonight.\n\nDan Ballard came off the bench against Spurs and added a lot to the defence – and I think we’ll see him return to the starting line up tonight, with Nordi moving over to right back. Omar Alderete will continue alongside Ballard, while I think Dennis Cirkin will get another run out after a hard fought hour at Spurs.\n\nI think we’ll see Trai Hume play as a right midfielder again today, dropping back to enable us to shift into a five in defence if need be. Ballard’s return will enable us to go with Geertruida in midfield too, with Enzo pushing up alongside Brian Brobbey and Simon Adingra – who’s been quietly impressive since getting back into the team – on the left.\n\nI thought Brobbey was excellent against Spurs – he didn’t have too many touches, but his off the ball work was impressive and signalled he’s really getting up to Premier League match fitness. Of course, his goal was fantastic too, and hopefully we’ll see him notch another tonight.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City return to the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday evening under significant pressure to reignite their title charge following a frustrating sequence of stalemates.\n\nPep Guardiola’s side saw their lead at the top vanish. Unfortunately, back-to-back draws against Sunderland and Chelsea proved costly. Now, they sit six points adrift of league leaders Arsenal. Historically, City boast an impeccable record against the Seagulls on home soil. However, a deepening defensive injury crisis threatens their title quest. Specifically, it could derail their hopes of closing the gap on the Gunners.\n\nConversely, Brighton arrive in Manchester with renewed optimism. Recently, they halted a bleak December run with a 2-0 victory over Burnley. Crucially, Fabian Hürzeler’s men already proved they can best the match favourites. Notably, they masterminded a 2-1 win at the Amex in August. Therefore, they aim to secure their first-ever league victory at the Etihad. Doing so would maintain their push for a top-half finish.\n\nDate: Wednesday, 7 January 2026\n\nVenue: Etihad Stadium, Manchester\n\nLast Meeting: Brighton 2–1 Manchester City, 31 August 2025, Premier League\n\nPep Guardiola is navigating a defensive emergency after Joško Gvardiol (ankle fracture) and Rúben Dias (hamstring) both sustained injuries against Chelsea. Gvardiol is expected to be out for an extended period, while Dias faces a recovery time of up to six weeks. They join John Stones on a crowded injury list, though Nathan Aké is fit to return, and Nico Gonzalez has been cleared to play. The hosts remain without Oscar Bobb, Mateo Kovačić, and Savinho, while Omar Marmoush and Rayan Aït-Nouri are away at the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nThe Seagulls will assess winger Yankuba Minteh (thigh) following his late withdrawal against West Ham, while Mats Wieffer remains out with a persistent toe injury. Fabian Hürzeler continues to be without Carlos Baleba (AFCON), Solly March (knee), Adam Webster (knee), and Stefanos Tzimas (knee). However, Kaoru Mitoma is fit to start after a successful return against Burnley, and veteran James Milner could feature to become just the fifth outfielder in Premier League history to play at age 40 or older.\n\nCity have established an incredible record of Wednesday dominance, winning 22 consecutive Premier League home games played on this specific day. The Etihad remains a fortress against this particular opponent, as City have never lost a home league game against Brighton in 15 attempts. However, Erling Haaland is currently enduring a rare goal search, having failed to score in his last three league starts. Guardiola will also be wary of another draw; one more stalemate would equal his personal record of three consecutive league draws.\n\nBrighton arrive with a perfect scoring record against City, having found the net in all 17 of their Premier League meetings. Nevertheless, their defensive fragility away from home is a concern, having conceded exactly two goals in each of their last three away Premier League matches. Hürzeler will be looking to replicate the tactical discipline shown in their August victory to exploit City’s depleted backline.\n\nManchester City predicted XI: Donnarumma; Lewis, Khusanov, Aké, O’Reilly; Rodri; Cherki, Foden, Reijnders, Doku; Haaland\n\nBrighton & Hove Albion predicted XI: Verbruggen; Veltman, Dunk, Van Hecke, Kadıoğlu; Gomez, Ayari; Gruda, Rutter, Mitoma; Kostoulas\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the match will be broadcast live on Sky Sports Main Event, Sky Ultra HD, SKY GO, and NOW TV.

    "fullText": "The post-Ruben Amorim era at Manchester United begins under the lights at Turf Moor this Wednesday, as interim head coach Darren Fletcher takes the reins following the Portuguese manager’s departure on Monday.\n\nDarren Fletcher is expected to restore a traditional tactical identity. Historically, the Scot was a staple of the Sir Alex Ferguson era. Now, his side remains firmly in the hunt for Champions League qualification. Specifically, Manchester United sit sixth. However, they remain level on points with fifth-placed Chelsea. In contrast, their hosts face much more dire straits.\n\nUnfortunately, Scott Parker’s Burnley suffer from an 11-match winless run. Consequently, they find themselves six points adrift of safety. Therefore, this midweek clash represents a vital “must-win” for both teams. Worryingly, the Clarets picked up only two points from a possible 33. Now, they desperately need a spark to avoid relegation. For United, this fixture offers a massive opportunity. Hopefully, they can turn recent stalemates into victories. Finally, Fletcher can make a statement of intent for the new year.\n\nDate: Wednesday, 7 January 2026\n\nLast Meeting: Manchester United 3–0 Burnley, 30 August 2025\n\nThe Clarets are navigating a severe availability crisis at a critical juncture of the season. Josh Cullen, Zeki Amdouni, Connor Roberts, and Jordan Beyer are all confirmed absentees due to injury. The squad is further thinned by the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), with Axel Tuanzebe, Hannibal Mejbri, and Lyle Foster still away in Morocco. However, there is hope that influential defender Maxime Estève could return to the backline after missing the recent defeat to Brighton.\n\nDarren Fletcher is set to transition back to a 4-2-3-1 formation and could be handed a massive boost with the return of club captain Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount, both of whom are nearing fitness. On the downside, the defensive unit remains depleted; Matthijs de Ligt (back), Harry Maguire (thigh), and Kobbie Mainoo (calf) are expected to miss out. Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo, and Noussair Mazraoui also remain unavailable due to AFCON commitments.\n\nBurnley have now lost nine of their last 11 Premier League games, a run that has seen them plummet to 19th in the standings. At home, their struggles are equally pronounced; they are winless in their last eight games against United at Turf Moor, scoring just a single goal in that period.

    "fullText": "Manchester United travel to Turf Moor tonight while they begin a new chapter under interim head coach Darren Fletcher.\n\nDarren Fletcher takes charge following Ruben Amorim’s departure. Notably, the interim manager abandons the previous tactical setup for a traditional 4-2-3-1 system. Desperately, Fletcher aims to secure a first victory of 2026. Crucially, he must capitalise on Burnley’s poor run of form to aid United’s Champions League push.\n\nFortunately, Darren Fletcher receives an immediate boost. Specifically, club captain Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount return to the fold. In fact, Fernandes could slot straight back into the starting XI to provide a creative spark. However, United remain without Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo, and Noussair Mazraoui due to AFCON commitments.\n\nUnfortunately, injuries deplete the defensive unit. Specifically, Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire, and Kobbie Mainoo remain sidelined. Consequently, Ayden Heaven looks set to partner Lisandro Martinez in central defence. In attack, Matheus Cunha will likely support Benjamin Sesko. Finally, Fletcher wants his players to “express themselves” in this freer system.\n\nManchester United predicted XI: Lammens; Dalot, Heaven, Martinez, Shaw; Casemiro, Ugarte; Dorgu, Fernandes, Cunha; Sesko\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at Turf Moor on Wednesday, 7 January 2026.

    "description": "“Now that he finds himself amid the bright lights of the Premier League, why shouldn’t he continue along the same path?”",
    "fullText": "Want an illustration of how quickly time seems to pass by in football terms — or simply graphic proof of how radically things have evolved at Sunderland in recent years?\n\nThe picture below was taken just under three years ago, during a game in which a ridiculously youthful Chris Rigg was denied what would’ve been a fairytale FA Cup goal against Fulham at Craven Cottage and everyone started to sit up and take notice of the latest exciting talent to roll off the Academy of Light’s production line.\n\nDuring the intervening three years, a hell of a lot has changed at the Stadium of Light.\n\nTony Mowbray was temporarily replaced by Mike Dodds, Michael Beale was hired and succeeded as head coach by Mike Dodds and then Régis Le Bris, and the entire process — often difficult and frustrating — eventually led to the promised land of Premier League promotion, with Rigg earning the right to call himself a top flight footballer after a red and white rise that’s encompassed memorable goals, eye-catching performances and plenty of excitement about what he could eventually achieve.\n\nOf course, the dynamic is very different now and if the Sunderland side in which Rigg made his first team debut was talented if somewhat unbalanced and lacking depth in key areas, the team in which he’s currently fighting to establish himself in is of a far higher standard.\n\nUnder Le Bris, Sunderland are competitive in the Premier League and after a heavyweight summer recruitment drive, Rigg is now surrounded by elite talents in more or less every position. As such, the former prodigy is entering the next stage of his development — one during which we all hope his rate of progress will continue.\n\nI firmly believe that at this stage and for the good of his future prospects, Rigg is exactly where he needs to be.\n\nIt’s true that he’s often been played outside of his “natural” position and although he always gives his all when deployed on the wing, it’s obvious that his skillset is best suited to the number ten position, albeit with Enzo Le Fée arguably our leading light in that particular role. That’s not necessarily problematic in itself — this league demands far greater quality and depth, after all — and for Rigg, perhaps it’ll simply be a matter of patience, discipline and seeing the bigger picture.\n\nGiven that he comes across as a single-minded, grounded and extremely driven young footballer, one would hope that the presence of such talent within the Sunderland camp is inspiring Rigg, driving him on and ensuring he keeps his eyes on the goal of constant improvement.\n\nIn my view, one thing is absolutely certain: Rigg should not be loaned out this month and if we arrive at the end of the transfer window having bade a temporary farewell to this immensely talented prospect, it would be detrimental to his own personal development and would also deprive Sunderland of a valuable option; someone who could play an important role during the final months of the season.\n\nDespite the impressive way in which we overhauled the squad during the summer, the long-standing argument of “He’s not ready for the Premier League” is ringing increasingly hollow, as is the notion that we should send a gifted player to the Championship on the basis they need to “toughen up”. In fact, it’s not too dissimilar to the stuff we used to hear as starry-eyed kids back in the Russell Foster days: “This player or that player won’t make it because they’re too small”, and so on.\n\nSuch has been the explosion of talented teenagers in recent years that if you haven’t established yourself by the age of twenty or so, you’re viewed as being behind the curve, but that’s a red herring.\n\nIt’s a universal truth that different players develop at different rates, and the idea of such a quality footballer being farmed out and forced to mix it with the likes of Millwall and Stoke City on the basis that his development will be expedited as a result is fairly gruesome.\n\nRigg is currently training and playing within an elite, high-performance environment, with a coach and captain setting and driving high standards having implemented a style of football that demands a great deal from the squad.\n\nTo my mind, that’s the perfect place for him and I trust Le Bris and his coaching staff to continue to do the right thing — and for Rigg himself to continue to apply himself properly and make the most of any and all opportunities that he’s given.\n\nAs was the case back in 2023, the sky is the limit for Rigg and now that he finds himself amid the bright lights of the Premier League, why shouldn’t he continue along the same path? It’s all within his hands and I’m hopeful that he’ll do exactly that.",

    "title": "On This Day (7 January 1862) Sunderland’s First Captain, John Auld, Is Born",
    "description": "Captain of our first league team and a player of considerable skill and influence, Johnny Auld was a leader on and off the field and something of a football pioneer.",
    "fullText": "John Robertson Auld was born in Scotland in 1862. His early football career appears to have been fashioned playing centre-half for Lugar Boswell, a club based in the small Ayrshire town of Lugar where he had moved to with his elder brother to open a Cordwainer’s (shoe-mender’s) business.\n\nHis determined and attacking performances brought him to the attention of famed Scottish side Third Lanark in 1883 and he seems to have played there for most of the period between 1883 to 1887, although there is record of him turning out for Queens Park during this period too. Both these clubs were within walking distance of his parents’ home in Glasgow, and it seems he spent weekends there, returning to his work in Lugar during the week.\n\nIn 1887/88 he signed for Queens Park, where his play was described as “a little rough”. He returned to play for Third Lanark in 1888/89 and it was in this season that the “Thirds” or the “Hi Hi” as they came to be known, won the Scottish Cup.\n\nThe winning of the trophy, as well as his three Scottish caps (two in 1887 and the other in 1889) all added to a burgeoning reputation for Auld in the game. He was an imposing centre-half who was adept at playing the more attacking Scottish version of his position and it was no surprise that clubs South of the border were showing interest.\n\nIn 1889 Tom Watson and Sunderland came North looking for talent. Top of their list was a captain and centre-half and Johnny Auld fitted the brief.\n\nSunderland were on the cusp of their first season in the Football League – indeed, they were the first team to join the league after its formation in 1888/89. Stoke had finished bottom and had failed to get re-elected. Sunderland had mounted a vigorous campaign to be elected, including a promise to pay the travel costs of all visiting teams, a not inconsiderable burden given every other team in the league was from the North West or Midlands.\n\nJohnny Auld was one of the first of a raft of heralded players recruited from Scotland by Sunderland in these early years of the league. Fine players such as Johnny Campbell and David Hannah from Renton, Hugh ‘Lalty’ Wilson from Newmilns and Jimmy Millar from Annbank were part of that first tranche of Scots to join Sunderland as “the team of all talents” began its formation.\n\nAged twenty-eight, Auld made the move South to join Tom Watson’s project. His transfer included an agreement by the club to facilitate the establishment of a Cordwainer’s business in the town. Auld also received a signing-on fee of £20 and £150 for agreeing to turn professional. He also negotiated a whopping £300 in salary over two years. He was, without doubt, a major investment on the part of the club at this time, and his influence in attracting the best of talent North of the Border was probably part of the package he brought with him.\n\nSunderland finished a credible seventh in their first season and played their way to the semi-final of the FA Cup, with the capture of Ned Doig for £150 from Arbroath a key acquisition as the spine of ‘the team of all talents’ took life with Doig, Auld and Campbell/Millar.\n\nThe following season 1891/92 with the inspirational Auld as pivot and captain and the arrival of James “Blood” Hannah and Donald Gow from Glasgow Rangers, Sunderland won the league championship at only the second time of asking. It was a huge achievement and backed up by a colourful march to the FA Cup semi-finals again.\n\nAuld’s influence and personality was a major factor in uniting and guiding these stars of the game into a team to be reckoned with.\n\nThe title was retained in 1892/93 and a runners-up spot in 1893/94, with the half-back line of Wilson, Auld and Gibson, with William Dunlop augmenting and eventually becoming a permanent member of this formidable line from 1892.\n\nIn 1894/95 the title was won again but by this point Johnny Auld was into his thirties and played only four games in the league campaign as he covered illness and injury in the half-back line. One game Johnny Auld did play in saw him captain the side and become the ‘World Champions’. Hearts, league champions in Scotland took on the English champions Sunderland on the 27th April 1895. Both teams were fully composed of Scottish players and a cracker of a game saw Sunderland and Johnny Auld lift the trophy, as they eventually triumphed by five goals to three, with Auld scoring one of the goals.\n\nIn 1896 Johnny Auld made the short but historic journey to Newcastle, becoming the first ever player to make that switch in the football league era. He only played a season before establishing a role that in its description resembles the modern day Sporting Director.\n\nHe became part of a three-man committee identifying players. His fame and influence were such that, similar to his time at Sunderland, a raft of good Scottish talent was signed. He was also instrumental in recruiting the innovative Scottish trainer John Quar McPherson. Consequently, by 1912, our closest rivals had three league titles and four FA Cup final defeats on their CV, eventually winning the cup in 1910.\n\nThroughout his time at Newcastle Johnny Auld continued to reside in Sunderland and oversee his Cordwainers business in the town. And, despite his role north of the Tyne, Auld still remained a key person in the story of Sunderland AFC. He acted as a financial guarantor for the club as Sunderland fell on hard times during the First World War, and also paid for the funeral of his former teammate Johnny Campbell in 1906.\n\nAuld was residing at 46 Roker Park Road in the town when he passed away after a fall from a tram at the age of seventy in 1932. He is buried in Mere Knolls cemetery in Sunderland.\n\nJohnny Auld was without doubt one of football’s first pioneers as a player. A captain and leader, his influence and skill, not only in defence but in the initiating of attacks at which he so excelled saw unprecedented success for the ‘team of all talents’ and rightly affords him a place in the history of Sunderland AFC.",

    "fullText": "Everton host Wolves tonight while they aim to recover from back-to-back home defeats.\n\nDavid Moyes’ side has moved into the bottom half of the table following a chaotic 4-2 loss to Brentford at the weekend. Despite a resilient away win at Nottingham Forest recently, the Toffees have struggled to maintain defensive solidity on their own patch. Moyes will be looking for a response from his senior core to ensure they do not slip further towards the relegation battle.\n\nDavid Moyes manages a significantly thinned squad due to international duty and a growing injury list. Iliman Ndiaye and Idrissa Gana Gueye are both unavailable as they represent Senegal at AFCON. Additionally, defensive mainstays Jarrad Branthwaite and Seamus Coleman remain out with hamstring injuries. Midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall is also a confirmed absentee with a similar issue.\n\nOn a positive note, Michael Keane is fit to continue in the heart of the defence alongside James Tarkowski. Merlin Röhl is pushing for a recall to the starting lineup after dropping to the bench in the previous match. Jack Grealish, who has already provided six assists in his debut campaign for the club, will be the primary creative outlet. He is expected to support a frontline featuring Thierno Barry and potentially Tyler Dibling.\n\nEverton predicted XI: Pickford; O’Brien, Tarkowski, Keane, Mykolenko; Iroegbunam, Garner; McNeil, Röhl, Grealish; Barry\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at the Hill Dickinson Stadium on Wednesday, 7 January 2026.

    "fullText": "Wolves travel to Liverpool tonight while they seek to build on their first victory of the Premier League season.\n\nRob Edwards finally secured three points with a dominant 3-0 win over West Ham at the weekend, snapping a 19-game winless run. While they remain at the bottom of the table, the victory has injected vital confidence into the squad. Edwards must now address his side’s poor away record, as the Old Gold have yet to win on the road this term.\n\nRob Edwards manages several significant absentees but is boosted by some positive fitness updates. Hwang Hee-chan and João Gomes are both expected to be fit after overcoming knocks sustained in the win over West Ham. However, captain Toti remains sidelined, and Emmanuel Agbadou is away on AFCON duty with Ivory Coast. Rodrigo Gomes and Marshall Munetsi are also nearing returns but are unlikely to start tonight.\n\nThe visitors are expected to name a largely unchanged side following their impressive performance at Molineux. Jhon Arias, who scored his first goal for the club last time out, will likely continue in midfield alongside André and Mateus Mane. Notably, Hwang Hee-chan reached 30 Premier League goal involvements for the club at the weekend and will be the focal point of the attack alongside Jorgen Strand Larsen. Edwards will be relying on this pair to end Wolves’ open-play goal drought away from home.\n\nWolves predicted XI: Sá; S. Bueno, Mosquera, Krejčí; Tchatchoua, Arias, André, Mané, H.

    "fullText": "Bournemouth host Tottenham Hotspur tonight while they aim to snap a historic 11-match winless streak.\n\nAndoni Iraola’s side has moved to 15th in the table following a spirited but ultimately unsuccessful 3-2 defeat to Arsenal. Despite the poor run, the Cherries have the motivation of securing a first-ever league double over Spurs. However, the manager must navigate a significant injury crisis that has worsened following the weekend’s action.\n\nThe headline for the hosts is the loss of Justin Kluivert, who requires surgery on a left knee injury. His absence adds to a depleted midfield and attack, with Ryan Christie and Tyler Adams still out. In defence, Ben Gannon-Doak remains sidelined, though Veljko Milosavljević provides a glimmer of hope, having returned to light training.\n\nThe focal point of the attack will once again be Antoine Semenyo. Although a £65m transfer to Manchester City has been agreed, the winger is expected to start in what is likely to be an emotional farewell appearance at the Vitality Stadium. He will be supported by Evanilson and David Brooks as the Cherries look to exploit a Spurs defence that has looked vulnerable in recent weeks.\n\nBournemouth predicted XI: Petrovic; Jimenez, Hill, Senesi, Truffert; Tavernier, Scott; Semenyo, Cook, Brooks; Evanilson\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at the Vitality Stadium on Wednesday, 7 January 2026.

Their away form isn’t nearly as good, which is another sign of how impressive this record is since they sit on thirty points as they occupy seventh in the table – only ahead of us on goal difference.\n\nEveryone thought the bubble had burst when Thomas Frank left to take the Spurs job, but Andrews has defied all of the predictions, although the pressure is firmly on holding their form at hom,e as only the bottom four have lost more than Brentford.\n\nIn all competitions, we’ve only taken on tonight’s opposition on twenty occasions. In the forty years between meetings in the league that ranged from 1947 and 1987, we took them on twice, once in the FA Cup and once in the League Cup and this is only our fourth trip to Griffin Park for a league game in the last forty years – the first in the top flight since 1946.\n\nIn the last four games, Le Bris’ side has shown how hard we are to beat; tonight we may need a similar performance.\n\nThe bookies have the Lads at 16/5 to win the game, while Brentford are priced at 4/5, and the draw is 5/2.\n\n[Yennaris 8’, Jozefzoon 47’, Maupay 78’ – Grabban 13’, Bentley (OG) 40’, Grabban (pen) 45’]\n\nSunderland: Steele, Jones, Kone, O’Shea, Oviedo, Watmore (McManaman), Cattermole, Ndong, McGeady (Vaughan), Honeyman, Grabban (Vaughan) Substitutes not used: Ruiter, Matthews, Gibson, Rodwell\n\nBrentford: Bentley, Dalsgaard, Clarke, Dennaris, Egan, Bjelland, Jozefzoon, Woods, Vibe (Maupay), Sawyers (McEachran), Watkins (Canos) Substitutes not used: Daniels, Barbet, Mepham, Mokotjo\n\nThey’re strong at home, and I think it will come down to the only goal of the game.",

    "description": "Skyridge came back to beat Layton 67-56, with double-digit points from four different seniors.",
    "fullText": "The two halves of Tuesday’s game between Layton and Skyridge couldn’t have been more different, and they showed off two completely different styles of play.\n\nLayton’s slow, defensive style dictated the first half, and the Lancers built up a lead. However, Skyridge’s fast-paced offense ruled supreme after halftime, and the Falcons ran away with the game 67-56.\n\nThe Lancers imposed their will first. It started on the defensive side of the ball as Layton built a quick 9-2 lead.\n\nLayton held Skyridge to only 22 points in the first half and minimized the Falcons’ strong suit, which is transition points. Rebounds and limiting turnovers also played into Layton’s hand and earned it a 29-22 halftime lead.\n\nSkyridge’s Ryder Gentry kept the offense afloat by scoring 10 of the Falcons’ 12 second-quarter points.\n\n“A lot of (the struggle) was because of Layton,” said Skyridge head coach Jeff Gardner. “Coach (Kelby) Miller runs one of the top programs in the state, and they came out and played really well and had us on our heels. They were really hard to score on. They blocked shots, and I felt like Layton really played well, but we made sure to just stay in the game, hanging around.”\n\nThe final 16 minutes couldn’t have looked much different from the first 16, and it all started in transition. Skyridge completely flipped the game’s pace by pushing the ball quickly after rebounds.\n\nSkyridge then took that opportunity to work the ball around and get open shots on the perimeter that it didn’t get in the first half. The Falcons’ Carson Mosteller hit two 3-pointers in the third quarter, with Zach Gagon and Gentry each adding another.\n\nThe quick pace and open shots led to a 20-4 run in the third quarter. In total, Skyridge outscored Layton 25-7.\n\n“We wanted to keep the pace, and we wanted to keep attacking the rim,” Gardner said. “We didn’t do a great job in the first half finishing at the rim, but we felt like if we kept attacking the rim, it would open up our threes.”\n\nLayton was down, but it certainly wasn’t out. The Lancers’ Karter Miller hit two 3-pointers, including a four-point play, to try to stay in it.\n\nThat fight back wasn’t in the cards for Layton as Skyridge kept making strong basketball plays. Gentry ended with a team-high 19 points, but he also contributed game-winning plays like offensive rebounds and smart extra passes on offense.\n\n“I love that we can come back from a rough first half and play an amazing second half, turn it around, win by 10 when we were down by 10,” Gentry said. “I feel like that just shows that we have really good fight in us and we’re a great team.”\n\nThe senior core of Gentry, Gagon, Mosteller and Joel Gardner each contributed double-digit points in the comeback win, which was the fourth consecutive for the Falcons.\n\n“Our team likes to play fast, and we’ve got this group of seniors who have been together since second grade, and they love to play with each other, and they believe in each other,” Gardner said. “I think just offensively, our whole message is attack the basket and then kick out when you can’t get to the rim. They did that masterfully.”",

    "fullText": "SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Alex Wennberg had a goal and an assist against his former team, and the San Jose Sharks bounced back from a frustrating loss three days earlier and beat the Columbus Blue Jackets 5-2 on Tuesday night.\n\nZack Ostapchuk also had a goal while Macklin Celebrini and Mario Ferraro added empty-netters to help the Sharks win their fourth in five games. Alex Nedeljkovic stopped 34 shots for San Jose, which was coming off a 7-3 loss to Tampa Bay on Saturday night.\n\nWennberg, the Blue Jackets’ first-round pick in 2013, assisted on Pavol Regenda’s goal in the first period then scored on a power play early in the second for his eighth goal of the season. That moved the 31-year-old within two points of reaching 400 for his career.\n\nCelebrini’s goal was his 23rd of the season and extended the 19-year-old’s career-high point streak to 11 games.\n\nZach Werenski scored his team-leading 16th goal for Columbus, and Sean Monahan also had a goal. Jet Greaves finished with 31 saves.\n\nSan Jose broke through moments after Nedeljkovic stopped Charlie Coyle’s wrist shot. Regenda responded quickly and broke free to score his sixth of the season on a cross-ice pass from Wennberg with 49 seconds left.\n\nWennberg made it 2-0 with a power-play goal at 4:14 of the second when he fired the puck between Greaves' legs. It gave Wennberg his seventh multi-point game of the season.\n\nWerenski trimmed San Jose’s lead to 2-1 with his goal late in the second. He has five points in three games since returning from an ankle injury.\n\nOstapchuk’s second goal of the season made it 3-1 before Monahan pulled the Blue Jackets within one with 3:55 to go.\n\nFerraro and Celebrini scored into the empty net 45 seconds apart to seal San Jose's win.\n\nBlue Jackets: At Vegas on Thursday night.\n\nSharks: At Los Angeles on Wednesday night.\n\nAP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES -- Coming off the heels of a 34-point loss to crosstown rival UCLA, the USC Women of Troy looked to etch a positive note in their first game back at the Galen Center in 2026 against the Oregon Ducks Tuesday night, but had, arguably, suffered an even greater loss. A contest that was surely in their hands from the jump, slipped away in a matter of minutes as the Ducks rallied back down by 16 points at the half and conjured up a 14-0 run to end the game, coming away with the 71-66 comeback win.\n\nFollowing the stunning turn of events for USC, Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb gave credit where it was due to Oregon.\n\n“Credit to Oregon. They were poised. I’m not surprised they hung in there when they were down… about as upsetting a loss as we’ve had in this building. We have a lot of potential to be really good, but not if we don’t figure some things out,\" coach Gottlieb said.\n\nBefore tip-off, USC had announced that defensive guru Kennedy Smith would be out Tuesday with a lower leg injury and listed as day-to-day. The absence of Smith was not felt until later down the stretch for the Women of Troy.\n\nUSC got off to a slow start offensively to begin the contest, mirroring their style of play at the Pauley Pavilion last Saturday, unable to score within the first four minutes of the game. The tides soothed for the Trojans as they would conclude the first quarter on an impressive 16-0 run, led by Kara Dunn's team-high 12 first-quarter points, and take a 23-9 lead to the second quarter.\n\nThe offensive production continued for the Women of Troy heading into the half, as Jazzy Davidson began her impressive performance on the floor, and by the end of regulation, notched the third double-double of her collegiate career with a final stat line of 14 points, 13 rebounds, 5 assists, 2 blocks, and two steals. Kara Dunn would lead the team with 21 points, but was more focused on the team's headspace and how they could improve on it moving forward, especially after back-to-back demoralizing losses.\n\n\"I think it's time that we make a change,\" Dunn said. \"Coming off a loss like that, we need to be as hungry as we can be, and going into the next game, we have to have a change of heart.\"\n\nCoach Gottlieb then voiced her view on the current status of her team's headspace and gave a clear reality check on what she saw shift from her team's first-half performance play, compared to the second half, which echoed through the media room in a frenzy.\n\n\"I thought we came out in the second half like we have arrived,\" coach Gottlieb said. \"That's why I called such a quick timeout in the third quarter because I did not like our demeanor. I did not like how it felt. I felt we weren't pressuring them as much.\"\n\nThe headspace has to change for the Women of Troy as they gave up 50 second-half points to the Ducks, including the 14-0 run that Oregon would eventually go on in the final four minutes of the fourth quarter that inevitably decided the Trojans' fate.\n\nWith back-to-back losses like this, it would be hard to find the big red reset button needed as the new year gets going, but the Women of Troy have a few days to clear their head of their worst losses of the season before traveling to Minnesota on Sunday.",

He finished the game with 16 points and 10 rebounds to help New Berlin and first-year coach Neil Holderread beat Pawnee 42-39 in a nonconference game and spoil Lucas’ return to the school where he coached for nine seasons and had a 165-102 record, plus two regional titles.\n\n“As a coach, he was good,” Hepperly said of Lucas. “He pushed us real hard. Playing against him just gives us extra motivation. Losing a coach, I mean, it sucks, but playing hard to beat him, it just felt good.”\n\nHepperly said he was hyped for the game all day.\n\n“I was ready to go. All day at school, I was just waiting,” Hepperly said. “And then I came out here and did my best.”\n\nMore: Bailey Leach, Plains girls basketball sink SHS comeback | Top performers\n\nDespite Lucas’ prompt return to the school, it was his first time coaching in the Pretzel Arena, which opened this school year to replace the Pretzel Dome as the Pretzels’ home gym. Lucas mostly dodged answering questions about his return.\n\n“You coach a group for several years and now you coach somewhere else,” he said. “God protects us. I'm thankful to be in Pawnee.”\n\nAbout the new gym, he said, “It's a nice gym.”\n\nGabe Molloy, one of two New Berlin seniors, had back-to-back layups to start the fourth quarter and pull the Pretzels into a 33-33 tie with 6 minutes, 58 seconds left. After a nearly two-minute lull in the scoring, Hepperly’s layup with 4:39 left gave New Berlin the lead for good.\n\n“Gabe's a really good player,” Holderread said. “He sets the tone defensively, he gets everything organized offensively. Things that don't show up in the stat sheet all the time.\n\n“He's not scoring a ton of points, (but) he's knocking down free throws when he needs to, he's getting us easy bucket after easy bucket. Gabe is a luxury to have, for sure.”\n\nIt was certainly a turnaround from how cold the Pretzels were in the second and third quarters. New Berlin began the game with a 14-9 lead after the first quarter but struggled to score in the middle periods: 3-for-16 in the second and 2-for-8 in the third. That allowed Pawnee (5-9) to establish its game and take a 28-21 lead before Carson Dodd connected on a 3-pointer with 3:21 left in the third. Ty Lederbrand, who was in foul trouble for most of the first half, scored in the paint and connected on a corner 3 for five quick points in the middle of that Pawnee run.\n\nNew Berlin didn’t want to lose twice to Pawnee in less than two weeks. Pawnee beat the Pretzels 47-35 in the first round of the Waverly Holiday Tournament on Dec. 26.\n\n“Last week we attacked their pressure and tonight, we just played a little hesitant,” Lucas said. “Because of that, we're on the other side of the win-loss column.”\n\nSophomore Gavin Greer led Pawnee with 15 points while Ryder Smith finished with 10. Pawnee shot 16-for-37 overall, including two of seven in the fourth. Pawnee was also outrebounded on the offensive glass 12-4 (New Berlin had a 30-26 rebounding edge overall).\n\n“We told our kids you can't expect just to come in and play the same way and expect the same result,” Lucas said. “You've got to bring it. Tonight was different: a little bit lesser stage here in the regular season where Waverly is about as good as it gets besides the postseason. We told our kids you had to come and even play better than you did. We just missed some free throws (2-for-8) and didn't rebound well enough to win tonight.”\n\nWith 3:13 remaining, Max Pointer hit a transition layup for a 37-33 lead and Hepperly followed that with a layup 49 seconds later.\n\n“He's a big body,” Holderread said of Hepperly. “He can do a lot of things for us. He's good on the boards, he's good in the post, he can shoot the 3.\n\n“He's a tough matchup for any team that we play. When he's able to do that early in the game, it kind of sets the tone for the rest of us, and we take advantage of that.”\n\nMore: North Mac boys basketball soaks up elusive Waverly Holiday title\n\nLederbrand then snapped the Pawnee scoring drought that lasted 7:02, from a Randy Schutt 3 with 1:16 left in the third until the layup by Lederbrand with 2:14 left in regulation. Jace Jankousky and Smith then split a pair of free throws to pull Pawnee within 39-37 with 1:10 left. Molloy had the final New Berlin field goal for a 41-37 lead and Greer hit a turnaround fadeaway shot with 26 seconds left. Pawnee’s hopes were ended on a turnover that became a jump ball to New Berlin with 2.4 remaining.\n\n“We're a veteran group,” Dodd said. “We have a lot of seniors and juniors, too, that stepped up this year. We practice hard, we know what we're doing in that situation; we were prepared.”\n\nHolderread reiterated Dodd’s sentiment.\n\n“We are veterans, but we're continuing to learn,” Holderread said. “That's our goal. We want to get better every single day. That's what we're trying to do.\n\n“I actually mentioned that at the end of the game here. We've kind of reversed roles. At the beginning of the season, it was me talking about how we're a veteran team, and we need to be able to close games when we lost a couple in the fourth quarter.\n\n“Now it's the opposite. We're doing those things where we have a lull in the middle of the game, and we're smart enough and veteran enough to make the right plays at the right time.\"\n\nContact Ryan Mahan: 788-1546, ryan.mahan@sj-r.com, Twitter.com/RyanMahanSJR.\n\nThis article originally appeared on State Journal-Register: IHSA boys basketball: New Berlin takes Round 2 meeting with Pawnee",

    "description": "EL SEGUNDO, Calif.",
    "fullText": "EL SEGUNDO, Calif. — The rise of another young star on the South Bay Lakers is grooming right in front of our eyes once again.\n\nMeanwhile, down in Southbay…\n\nKobe Bufkin w/ another:\n\n27 pts | 8 reb | 8 ast | 4 stls | 2 blks pic.twitter.com/Po1vn6zXEr\n\n— Lakers Legacy (@LakersLegacyPod) January 7, 2026\n\nIf history has taught us anything, it’s that South Bay is more than just a G League stop—it’s a proving ground. Alex Caruso carved his path here. Austin Reaves refined his game here. Scottie Pippen Jr. rebuilt momentum here. Time and time again, the South Bay Lakers have developed players who either make it back to the NBA or force an NBA team’s hand.\n\nKobe Bufkin looks like the next name on that list.\n\nBufkin poured in 27 points to lead South Bay to a 113–101 win over the Memphis Hustle, putting together another all-around performance that continues to turn heads around the league. At just 22 years old, Bufkin is playing with the confidence, poise, and edge of someone who knows this opportunity won’t last forever.\n\nDrafted 15th overall by the Atlanta Hawks in 2023 out of Michigan, Bufkin entered the league with high expectations. But as is often the case with young guards, things didn’t pan out the way either side envisioned early on. A new chapter opened on November 13, 2025, when Bufkin was traded from the Motor City Cruise, Detroit’s G League affiliate, and landed in South Bay.\n\nThere’s a certain poetry to it.\n\nBufkin was named after the late, great Kobe Bryant, and now finds himself wearing purple and gold in the organization most synonymous with the Mamba legacy.\n\n“Kobe is my favorite player,” Bufkin said. “Just seeing his name on the wall, his pictures of him, it’s cool.”\n\nThat connection isn’t just symbolic. Bufkin often laces up Kobe Bryant signature shoes, occasionally switching to Jayson Tatum’s JT line, but the influence is clear in the way he plays—fearless, aggressive, and relentlessly competitive.\n\nJack Haslett -- The Sporting Tribune\n\nSouth Bay Lakers guard Kobe Bufkin (6) waits for his teammates to help him up during a G-League basketball game between the South Bay Lakers and Memphis Hustle Tuesday, January 6, 2026 at UCLA Health Training Center in El Segendo, Calif.\n\nSince arriving in South Bay, Bufkin has been lighting up the scoreboard, averaging 28.3 points, 5.0 assists, and 4.3 rebounds through his first four regular-season games. Against Memphis, he set the tone early.\n\nBufkin scored 10 points in the first quarter, igniting a Lakers offense that jumped out to a double-digit lead and stretched it to as many as 15 points in the first half. Every time the Hustle tried to close the gap, Bufkin answered.\n\nThe defining sequence came late in the third quarter. Bufkin took an offensive foul on a moving screen, popped right back up, demanded the ball, attacked the lane, floated in a tough finish, absorbed contact, and calmly knocked down the free throw to complete the three-point play for his 20th point of the night. It was a sequence that embodied his mindset—toughness, urgency, and zero hesitation.\n\nBufkin finished with 27 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists in 39 minutes, stuffing the stat sheet while controlling the game’s biggest moments.\n\n“Taking advantage of that, getting my teammates involved,” Bufkin said. “When they weren’t down there protecting the rim, I’m taking it to the rim and making shots.”\n\nThe backcourt pairing of Bufkin and RJ Davis proved overwhelming for Memphis. Davis controlled the pace, organized the offense, and complemented Bufkin’s scoring punch, finishing with 17 points. Together, they kept the Hustle off balance all night.\n\nSouth Bay also received strong contributions across the board. Anton Watson scored 18 points, Tevian Jones added 14, and Kylor Kelley chipped in 13, as all five starters finished in double figures. Off the bench, Arthur Kaluma provided an immediate spark, scoring nine points in the first quarter alone and finishing with 16 points, knocking down all three of his attempts from beyond the arc.\n\nDespite committing 28 turnovers, the Lakers found ways to score, shooting an impressive 16-for-35 (45.7%) from three-point range and building a lead that grew to 16 points in the second half. Defensively, South Bay protected the paint, swatting away 14 shots in the win.\n\n“Something me and RJ gotta talk about,” Bufkin said of the turnovers. “Slowing down, getting to our reads—but yeah, that’s on us.”\n\nEven in victory, accountability remains part of Bufkin’s approach—another trait reminiscent of the name stitched across his chest.\n\nSouth Bay now heads to Austin, Texas for a two-game road trip before returning home to host the San Diego Clippers on January 14. If Bufkin continues on this trajectory, it won’t be long before NBA teams start circling once again.\n\n“There’s been a lot of things that I’ve seen around the league, learning to keep your head down and keep working,” Bufkin said on the noise surrounding his name around the league.\n\nAnother Kobe is rising in South Bay—and this one looks ready for his next shot.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea’s new head coach, Liam Rosenior is expected to be in attendance but will not leading the team just yet as the Blues make the short trip down the road to Craven Cottage, to take on friendly rivals Fulham. Instead of Rosenior, it will be interim head coach Calum McFarlane calling the shots, and hopefully just as effectively as he did over the weekend, when he engineered a very credible 1-1 draw away against Manchester City.\n\nAlas, the only team to truly benefit from that draw were Arsenal, who now have a six point lead at the top of the table, just past the halfway mark of the season.\n\nFor Chelsea, it’s now just one win in our last eight Premier League matches, collecting just eight points from the 24 on offer. Somehow we’re still in fifth, but we’re going to have to start picking up points if we want to remain in the Champions League places by season’s end.\n\nDate / Time: Wednesday, January 7, 19.30 GMT; 2:30pm EST; 1am IST (next day)\nVenue: Craven Cottage, SW6\nReferee: Peter Bankes (on pitch); John Brooks (VAR)\nForecast: Partly sunny and a slight breeze; no more snow sadly\n\nOn TV: Sky Sports Football (UK); none (USA); Star Sports Select HD2 (India); none (NGA); elsewhere\nStreaming: Sky Go (UK); Peacock (USA); JioHotstar (India); DStv Now, SuperSport GOtv (NGA)\n\nFulham team news: It’s been a decent festive period for midtable (as usual) Fulham, getting draws against Liverpool and Crystal Palace and wins against West Ham and Nottingham Forest. Their draw against Liverpool, last time out, saw both teams score in added-on time, with Fulham equalizing on a most unlikely Goal of the Season worldie from Harrison Reed: just his fourth goal in over 200 appearances for the club.\n\nHARRISON REED GOAL FROM ALL OF THE ANGLES WHAT A GOAL 😮‍💨👏🏻pic.twitter.com/DZGfsF6Srw\n\n— KinG £ (@xKGx__) January 4, 2026\n\nAnd they’ve done all that despite losing a trio of key players to Nigeria at the Africa Cup of Nations (Alex Iwobi, Calvin Bassey, and Samuel Chukwueze), and missing a few others through injury (Josh King, Kenny Tete, and Rodrigo Muniz). In better news for them, Ryan Sessegnon looks set to return from a hamstring problem.\n\nManager Marco Silva is weary of the mental and physical tolls these games have taken on his players, though such concerns can fall by the wayside when it comes to special derbies (even friendly ones), especially when one side may feel wronged by a certain decision (i.e. Josh King’s goal getting ruled in the reverse fixture at the Bridge earlier this season).\n\n“It’s special. It’s special, because we know what’s happened. […] It really hurt ourselves, our fans, this football club, the way we were not able to win the game at Stamford Bridge. The way the team performed almost perfectly first half, in a really tough game against a top, top side, the way the team performed, and everything that happened in that game, really hurt this football club. I’m not talking about one or two persons, or just the players – us, the football club, the way that things happened that Saturday morning.\n\n“It is what it is – now it’s another opportunity for us to enjoy, to embrace a big challenge with our fans to play a derby like a derby should be played. Simple as that. It’s a new game, a new story. I don’t want anyone to think about the past, we have to look for the future, and what’s going to be most important is the next one. It’s a special game.”\n\n-Marco Silva; \n\nChelsea team news: Robert Sánchez and Wesley Fofana were both late scratches over the weekend, with injury and illness, respectively, but they are both back in training and in contention to start. Same goes for Marc Cucurella, who’s barely ever injured, but has missed the last couple games with a hamstring concern. We also welcome back Moisés Caicedo from his latest suspension.\n\nLevi Colwill, Dário Essugo, and Roméo Lavia remain out. The club recently wished Mykhailo Mudryk a happy birthday on social media, so we should probably mention the suspended winger here as well. How’s the appeals process going, Misha?\n\nMcFarlane will be hoping to hand over the reigns to Rosenior with the team back on the right path.\n\n“[This is a] really talented group, young, hungry, have shown they can play at the top top level against top top sides. Anyone associated with the club should be proud of their performance on Sunday and moving forward, this team has massive, massive potential so we should all be excited.”\n\n-Calum McFarlane; \n\nPreviously: Last season, we went to Craven Cottage on a low and came back on an absolute high. Tyrique George’s late equalizer and Pedro Neto’s even-later winner galvanized the team into a scorching hot run of form and results, culminating in not only a top-four finish but winning the FIFA Club World Cup later that summer.",

    "description": "Juve’s most maligned player was key as Juve coasted to a win at an old bogey ground.",
    "fullText": "All of three days ago, Juventus dominated their opponent, but didn’t use that dominance properly and ended up dropping points when they couldn’t convert that dominance to goals.\n\nFor a while, Tuesday night’s game against Sassuolo looked like it would be similar. Juve had at least managed to take score first after Pierre Kalulu’s cross was redirected by former Juve NextGen prospect Tarik Muharemovic into his own net 15 minutes in. But, despite once again sealing their opponents into their own half and refusing to let them out, Juventus once again couldn’t put the ball back into the net, seemingly leaving themselves open to paying a heavy price for a single mistake the way they had against Lecce.\n\nThe fact that they were at the Mapei Stadium — a place that Juve had lost two straight years before the Neroverdi spent last year in Serie B — jangled the nerves all the more.\n\nBut there were two big differences between Tuesday and Saturday. The first is that Juve didn’t make any boneheaded mistakes. The second was that Jonathan David — their most maligned player after his catastrophic penalty miss over the weekend — had his first true big game in a Juventus shirt, capping off an effective performance with an assist and a goal within two minutes of each other to propel the Bianconeri to a 3-0 victory to end the andata and match Roma and Como, who had both won earlier in the day, in order to stay ahead in the race for fourth place.\n\nLuciano Spalletti was unable to carry the 4-2-3-1 formation he used against Lecce over to Tuesday’s match because of injuries at the back. Lloyd Kelly and Francisco Conceição had taken minor knocks on Saturday and weren’t risked on the short turnaround, while Daniele Rugani, Federico Gatti, Jonas Rouhi, Dusan Vlahovic, and Arkadiusz Milik all joined them on the treatment table. With the defense stretched thin, Spalletti was forced to return to the 3-4-2-1. Michele Di Gregorio started in goal, fronted by Kalulu, Bremer, and Teun Koopmeiners. Weston McKennie and Andrea Cambiaso played at wing-back, sandwiching the usual midfield of Manuel Locatelli and Khéphren Thuram. Fabio Miretti joined Kenan Yildiz backing up David in attack.\n\nSassuolo was managed by former Juve defender and Italy legend Fabio Grosso, who was marking his 400th game as a first-team manager. He was missing a couple of his more recongnizable names, chief among them Domenico Berardi. Cristian Volpato, Filippo Romagna, Daniele Boloca, and Edoardo Pierangolo were also injured, and Woyo Coulibaly was playing for Mali at AFCON. Grosso deployed a 4-3-3, backstopped by goalkeeper Arijanet Muric. Sebastian Walukeiwicz, Jay Idzes, Muharemovic, and Josh Doig made up the back four. Ismaël Koné, Edoardo Iannoni, and Nemanja Matic made up the midfield, while Kristian Thorstvedt and Armand Laurienté flanked Andrea Pinamonti in the attacking trident.\n\nIt was actually Sassuolo who registered the first two shots of the game after Juve started fairly sloppily. Walukeiwicz poked a corner over less than two minutes in, and Thorstvedt jumped a bad pass only to fire wide two minutes after that. But soon the general flow of the game became quite clear: Juve going forward, Sassuolo struggling to break out.\n\nIn the ninth minute Yildiz stole the ball from Walukeiwicz at the corner of the box and tried to surprise Muric at the near post, but the keeper was able to parry before Cambiaso put the rebound into the side netting from a tight angle. David found Thuram for the first of his six (six!) key passes on the night a few minutes later, but the Frenchman’s shot went righ at Muric.\n\nBut the Kosovar keeper could do nothing just after the quarter-hour mark, when Kalulu came forward to aid the attack and sent in a cross. He was looking for the run of Miretti in the middle, but his ball was met by the head of Muharemovic, who was trying to clear but instead glanced it into his own net, far from anywhere where Muric could hope to intervene. The promising young center-back’s mistake gave Juve what they’d never managed at the Allianz over the weekend: a lead.\n\nThe next task was to consolidate that lead — which the team had problems doing. David tried to twist a ball in at a tight angle from the right but couldn’t beat Muric, while Yildiz had two shots denied sandwiched around the half-hour mark. The young Turk had another opportunity five minutes before the break, this time hitting a powerful shot across goal that Muric again had to parry, lucky to hit it right at Idzes, who reacted well to clear.\n\nJuve came out of the gate looking to kill the game off, but were still having issues doing just that. Locatelli must have thought he’d spotted Muric off his line a few minutes after kickoff, because he hit a long-distance lob that flew well over the goal, beforee Thuram was sent down the left channel but elected to go himself instead of feeding one of three runners to his right, forcing a relatively easy save out of Muric. Miretti joined the effort and stabbed a square pass from David over from inside the box, and it looked as though the frustration might be starting to mount.\n\nBut only two minutes later, David connected with Miretti again, to much better results. McKennie chested a long ball down and passed it to David, who quickly side-footed the ball into the path of Miretti. He tore past Muharemovic and into the right channel, then ripped the ball past Muric and into the far side of the net. It was his first goal in 10 months and his first goal for Juventus in nearly two years.\n\nWithin 109 seconds, David had stomped out any chance the hosts might’ve had for a comeback. Pressure from the Canadian forced Idzes into a horrific back pass that the striker pounced on. He dribbled the ball around Muric and kept his cool as he slotted home past Walukeiwicz’s feeble attempt to swipe it off the line. The unity of the team then showed out. After so much criticism—as well as reports that David was an outsider in the locker room—the entire team, on the field and on the bench, mobbed him. Even Spalletti ran downfield to celebrate with the man he’d shown a vote of confidence by starting him again.\n\nHe almost added another seconds later when another bad turnover in the Sassuolo box fell to him, but this time he fired high. But at that point it mattered little—the game was well and truly over. Both sides knew they were simply playing out the stretch, and the rhythm of the game reflected it. Sassuolo did finally put a shot on target in the 84th minute when Nicholas Pierini tested Di Gregorio from a direct free kick, then Luca Lipani added another on the ensuing corner that Juve’s keeper again met with a parry.\n\nThere was little to do for the defense besides that, and as the final whistle blared out across the Mapei Stadium, the Bianconeri walked toward the traveling fans to celebrate their first win at the ground since 2022, and to closing out the andata in style.",

    "fullText": "Arizona women’s basketball won its first Big 12 game of the Becky Burke era Tuesday night by taking down BYU at McKale Center. For a team that had dropped its first three conferences games, the victory was much-needed.\n\nWhat changed Tuesday? Burke credited the performance to the team’s all-around effort level.\n\n“BYU plays extremely hard. We played harder,” Burke said. “We’re capable of it. We’ve shown it now. Now that’s the standard.”\n\nNow that Arizona has its first Big 12 win in the bag, Burke believes her team is capable of playing with the same type of energy on a nightly basis.\n\n“Because I think this is a group that when they when they do something well, and get rewarded for it and see the fruits of their labor, I think they then want to do more of it,” Burke said.“\n\nOur recap of the game can be found here. Below is what Burke, Nora Francois, Sumayah Sugapong and Tanyuel Welch had to say after the game.\n\nBurke on her overall thoughts on the win: “I am overjoyed. I’m so excited for our group. You know, we needed this. We worked our butts off for this. That’s a really, really, really good team. I’ve played, I’ve won games, I’ve done it. Like I am so happy for them. For a lot of these, literally, all three of these guys to win their first Power 4 games, especially here in Arizona, it’s really special. And we were just talking through the first three games of big 12 play. We just got to keep battling, stay the course, and when we get our first one, what that is going to do for this team, to just rejuvenate them and build that confidence, that they can go win games if we play the way that we play today. So shout out to our staff and coach Julie game plan was absolutely phenomenal. Shout out to them for executing it to perfection and pairing that with being the hardest game. You know, our effort that was, that was they’ve played the hardest they’ve played all season tonight. So I could not be more happy for these guys.”\n\nOn Arizona’s defensive intensity: “Well we forced them into 27 turnovers. I didn’t think it was going to be that high, but, like, I knew we could turn them over. Oheir offense is very, very, very ball screen oriented. There’s one, two, maybe three on every possession. A lot of people have just been letting them use ball screens this year, and they’re so good at picking you apart. They’ll take anything you give them off ball screens. So we just said we’re gonna shake some stuff up. We’re not gonna let them use ball screens and do what they want. We’re going to dictate defensively. Our ball pressure, and then Nora hedged ball screens for 40 minutes like I’ve never seen before, you know. So it was just a tremendous effort by them, but to force a minute 27 turnovers, it’s really hard to win when you turn the ball over that many times. So just just credit to our group for doing that and causing those.”\n\nOn asking Francois to hedging ball screens, and what Francois brought offensively: “We had a horrible trip back from Texas Tech, and we’re getting off the plane, and we prepped on the airplane for the next one, and Nora is getting off. And I’m like, Nora, can you hedge a ball screen? She’s like, ‘Very well, actually.’ I’m like, okay, so she proved herself right today. What she did on the defensive end, I think, like, had just helped her flow offensively. I mean, she was very effective on the defensive end. It’s easy when you guard and you do what you’re supposed to do on that end, to have some juice and to have, like, to go sprint to screens. It was really nice to see. And our guards fed her the ball, like, extremely well. She created for herself some. Our guards created for her some. And then she was finishing today, which is the most encouraging thing, you know, because she’s gonna make a couple, she’s gonna miss a couple. That’s kind of what we’ve been living with all year. But she was making them today, and the focus was there. She would say the same thing, and she probably will, but like, credit to the guards too. Nora was screening, rolling and posting, and we were feeding her. like we just kept going to what was working. And that’s just like, such, such high IQ by our players, without me having to like, walk them through every little thing.”\n\nOn getting Sugapong back in the lineup: “Yeah, a lot of it’s been like game plan. size of opponents. I told Sumayah the other day, it’s really hard to have you and Lani on the floor at the same time, given this game plan and how aggressive we were going to be and how they’re very guard oriented. We knew Sumayah could play a ton of this game, and she did, you know. So it’s really not a Sumayah thing, it’s a game plan, personnel on the other teams thing, you know. So it was, it was nice to see her go out there and just pick up where she left off. And the tight rotation today, I told everybody in practice like I’m going with who’s going to do what I’m asking him to do at a really high level. So if it’s five or six, the rest of the way, we’ll call plenty of timeouts, we’ll get plenty of treatment, and we’ll see what these guys got. But the five or six that played the heavy minutes tonight were the ones that were getting it done. So if it’s not broke, I’m not going to fix it.”\n\nOn the number of hustle plays and playing with a higher effort level: “Yeah, the chart is in my brain. When I see our players on the floor, left and right, it fires me up. Like that is who we have to be. Our slogan is sleeves up. They rolled their sleeves up today. Got dirty like there was no question that we played harder. And BYU plays extremely hard. We played harder. We’re capable of it. We’ve shown it now. Now that’s the standard. Like, we have to be that team. We’ve proven, like we did tonight, that if we’re that team and we can play that hard every night, we’ll give ourselves a chance every single time. These kind of 50/50 games we’ll win. These will sneak a couple that we’re not supposed to win, you know, but we have to play this hard and harder the rest of the way. You know, you saw a little two, two minute stretch. We didn’t play super hard. What happened? Boom, 14 to 4 run. We have to play hard the rest of the season. They can rest in April, like, we have to play hard. So, but I like, to your point, there was a zero question. And the fans love it. I mean, I loved, like, I loved doing that stuff, because I love the fans cheering for me like that on the floor. You want them to, like, cheer for you, right? Like, you want to feel good. You want like, yeah, we got it. We got to do that stuff, especially in the atmosphere that we have here. It just fires everybody up.”\n\nOn the support of the fanbase and the significance of beating BYU: “This is how special this place is. I mean, we just started conference play 0-3 and this might have been one of our biggest crowds. That is why I took this job there. We’re obviously going to battle and fight this year and make everybody proud and do a great job and have a lot of momentum. But like, we want to recruit the best players in the country here. We want to win a national championship here. Why would somebody not want to come to a place that, when we’re 0-3 in the Big 12, you still get to play in front of 8,000 people? It is an incredibly unique place when it comes to that. I was excited. I knew we were going to get one. It was a matter of when it was. Because I think this is a group that when they when they do something well, and get rewarded for it and see the fruits of their labor, I think they then want to do more of it. And I think they then want to continue what they did to have that success. Yeah, it was really hard for us to get it right? Three games. But like now that they’ve got it, I think they’re going to be locked in for the UCF game plan the same way that they were for this one. I think they’re going to trust us a little bit more than if we do exactly what we’re asking them to do, that, hey, it actually worked. That’s what type of group this is. So if they needed one to go get two or three in these next few, then I’m glad we kind of got the monkey off our back a little bit. But I told them, if you get even a little bit complacent and you think because you beat BYU that we’ve arrived, you’re gonna drop one on Saturday. This is an every night league, and we can’t take our foot off the gas at all.”\n\nOn how the team can offset rebounding struggles: “We’re boxing out. It’s the pursuit to go get it after we box out. There wasn’t a whole lot of shot, like we turned them over 27 times. So that’s 27 shots. They didn’t take for us to rebound it. So I think some of those stats are a little bit skewed sometimes. Don’t get me wrong, we’re not a great rebounding team ever, but yeah, I’d rather live steals than rebounds in this game, particularly, T goes and snatches a bunch. But we have to be better at hitting and going and pursuing the ball.”\n\nOn preparing for UCF: “I don’t talk or think about the next team until we take care of business with the first team. You look at scores in the league, it’s just what we do, right? But no, I don’t have to know anything about them to know that we need to bring our best on Saturday. We need to play high level basketball. We need to build off this momentum. We need to be extremely locked in.”\n\nOn the possibility of starting Big 12 play 2-3: “It would be huge. These are so hard earned and hard to get. They know how hard that win was out there? Like, I’m glad they have an off day tomorrow, because they need it, you know? So it’s big, but we could also be 1-4, so they got to be locked.”\n\nFrancois on executing on defense, particularly hedges: “So actually, on the plane leaving our last game, coach asked me, she’s like, ‘Nora, do you know how to hedge?’ I was like, ‘This is my time to shine. This is my time.’ Definitely very familiar with hard hedging, soft hedging, anything. Drop coverage is fine, but just being prepared for that, going into practice, knowing that I’m gonna have my moments. That was really the biggest adjustment.”\n\nOn knocking the ball away in late defensive stand: “I read the inbounder’s eyes, and she was trying so hard not to look at my person. So I was like, All right, it’s coming to her. So I just got her arm up, tipped it, thankfully. Sumayah turned around, secured it and yeah.”\n\nOn her chemistry with Lani Cornfield: “I had to make an adjustment. I’m used to picking and rolling and putting my hand up to get the ball up here, but with Lani, it’s a lot of bounce passes, so making sure you know your hands are ready. Yeah, because she’ll find you. She’ll find you.”\n\nSugapong on going 9-9 from the free throw line: “My teammates trusts me with the ball down this stretch, which does a lot for my confidence. And then, you know, all the hours in the gym, just getting a free throws and free throws, that’s what gave me the confidence to step up those shots and knock them down.“\n\nOn staying ready when she wasn’t playing as much: “Yeah, just mentally staying locked in. I mean, I trust the coaches their game plan going into every game. So just for sure just staying locked in, being ready when my number’s called.”\n\nWelch on the importance of the home crowd: “One thing I can say, after being on the road for two games, we definitely missed being at home and having those fans. It don’t matter what’s going on in the game. We could be down, we could be up, we could be having, like, a bad stretch, the other team could have a stretch, but they really helped change the momentum for us. You know, we get a little stop and they’ll make it seem like we just won the championship. So a little stuff like that really, really helps our team.”\n\nOn being healthy and having six straight games in double figures: “The beginning the season, I had a concussion. You know, I had to work my way back in, work back from my spot. So I just took pride and wanted to be on the floor. I do whatever it takes to help my team. As you can see, I rebounded really well tonight, and I feel like that’s what we needed the most. BYU is really good at crashing the boards as far as offenses, so I made sure I secured it. And as far as my performance go, I just feel like I play a big role for this team, whether I’m scoring or not. On both ends of the floor, offensively and defensively, I set the tone. So with that being said, I have to be there. I have to be present for my team. Also like to use my voice and keep us together and huddle and all that. So yeah, just using that energy and letting my hard work show.”\n\nOn staying locked in: “I mean, now that we got our first one, I feel like it would give us a lot more momentum going into these next ones. I feel like we all can agree that tonight was fun. We enjoyed the game. So why wouldn’t we want to just keep growing from here, you know, making it exciting and growing together and just learning throughout the season. So I feel like this win tonight would really help.”\n\nOn what it takes to maintain defensive energy: “Well, you got to do it or you’re coming out the game. So I feel like that’s the first part of it. And I mean, those are the type of plays that, if we’re not going offensively, those turn into transition points. There’s just type of plays we need to win games, and everybody wants to win so everybody’s out there playing 100%.”",

    "fullText": "It’s been another frustrating season for Federico Chiesa.\n\nAlthough the Italian winger has made himself a crowd favourite throughout his short time at Anfield he has been unable to win over Arne Slot decisively.\n\nUsed sparingly during the 2024/25 Premier League title-winning campaign, Chiesa has admittedly played more this term.\n\nHe fought back during the summer to become a first-team option for Slot - but he has only managed one Premier League start in the season to this point.\n\nAs a result of his lack of game time, it’s been suggested that the 28-year-old could be moving back to Serie A.\n\nRoma have been mentioned as possible suitors but now it seems that Liverpool could be willing to do business with Juventus over a potential deal.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nSporting director Richard Hughes signed Chiesa from Juventus for £12m back in September 2024 with the Italy international inking a deal until 2028.\n\nAnd according to a report on Sky Sports the Anfield club would be willing to offload Chiesa this January - but there is one condition attached.\n\nThe English side will NOT entertain a loan move for Chiesa but would like to sell him on a permanent basis instead.\n\n“Juventus has inquired with the player's representatives to see if there are any opportunities to bring him back to Italy on loan. Liverpool has been open to the move, but only on a permanent basis,” the report reads.\n\nThe source also mentions that Napoli have been in touch about a loan move.\n\nAnd according to Gazzetta dello Sport Chiesa has now responded to Juventus’ transfer interest - and WOULD be willing to move back to Turin this winter.\n\n“After hearing the Italian winger's openness to a possible return to the Bianconeri, Juventus officials have expressed their interest in welcoming the player back to Continassa, exploring whether the Reds would be willing to open negotiations in the second half of January,” the report reads.\n\nA deal could be concluded in the second half of the month owing to Liverpool’s shortage up top right now.\n\nHugo Ekitike has been carrying an injury, Alexander Isak is out following a broken leg and Mohamed Salah is away at AFCON. But once those issues begin to resolve we could see an exit for Chiesa materialise very rapidly.",

    "title": "'Yamagata is ramen': Japan's city of noodle fiends revels in 'capital' status",
    "description": "Noodle dish is nation’s favourite comfort food and source of civic pride – but it has health risks",
    "fullText": "Noodle dish is nation’s favourite comfort food and source of civic pride – but it has health risks\n\nThe road to ramen paradise ends in the unlikeliest of places. At Men Endo, located in a suburban street, next to a school and a low-rise apartment block, bowls of noodles disappear in a flurry of slurps, gulps and hurried but heartfelt exchanges of appreciation between customer and chef.\n\nOn a cold afternoon in Yamagata, a city in Japan’s northeast, the wait for a seat at Men Endo’s counter is mercifully short. Inside the door, a ticket dispenser lists myriad options, from regular shoyu (soy sauce) ramen – in small, medium or large portions – to maji soba, a soupless symphony of toppings, sauce and noodles that diners are invited to mix together with their chopsticks, along with a spoonful of spicy miso.\n\nThat Men Endo – men is from menrui, the Japanese word for noodles, and Endo is a family name – has managed to secure a loyal clientele – which today includes construction workers, couples and a solo diner from the Guardian – is no mean feat.\n\nIn Yamagata, 340km north of Tokyo, noodle fiends have around 230 establishments to choose from, with several opening their doors early for those craving comfort food.\n\n“People here don’t ask each other where they want to go for dinner, but which ramen restaurant to go to,” says Osamu Higuchi, assistant manager in Yamagata’s brand strategy section.\n\nIt is that level of dedication to eating at restaurants – as opposed to making ramen at home or grabbing a lunchtime cup of the instant variety – that has earned Yamagata, a modestly sized city of 240,000, the title of Japan’s ramen capital.\n\nThe accolade is a source of pride, its current reign the result of an aggressive campaign to outperform its closest rival, Niigata, which shocked the ramen world by taking the title in 2021.\n\nLast year, Yamagata’s households each spent an average of ¥22,389 [£106] on ramen – well ahead of second-placed Niigata on ¥16,292, according to the internal affairs ministry, which will soon announce the winner for 2025. Only the annual ranking for gyoza consumption generates similar levels of anticipation. That title currently belongs to Hamamatsu in central Japan.\n\n“When Niigata won it was a huge shock,” says Higuchi. “Eating ramen is a big part of daily life here … to be honest it hurt our feelings.”\n\nBut the city’s appetite for ramen has its drawbacks. Frequent consumption can increase health risks, mainly due to the soup’s high salt content, according to a study of almost 7,000 people aged 40 and over led by Yamagata University. People who have the dish three or more times a week have a mortality risk 1.52 times higher than those who eat it once or twice a week, according to the four-year study published in October in the Journal of Nutrition, Health and Aging.\n\nThe experts added, however, that the statistics did not mean regular consumption was a “definite danger”, given that those most at risk possibly indulged in other habits “common among frequent ramen” eaters, such as excessive overall salt intake, drinking and smoking.\n\n“I’ve been trying not to drink all of the soup, but it’s very moreish, and the chefs go to a lot of effort to make it so it feels rude to leave any,” says Higuchi who, after consulting a smartphone app, announces he has polished off 225 bowls of ramen so far this year. “That said, households here spend an average of about ¥2,000 a month on ramen … it’s not that much when you think about it.”\n\nHealth risks aside, no Japanese dish commands as much loyalty, or generates as much discussion, as ramen. Popularised in Japan after the second world war – thanks to returning soldiers who fondly recalled how it had sustained them in Japanese-occupied China – it became a symbol of recovery and resilience.\n\nRamen critic Rikiya Yamaji believes Yamagata has perfected the art of adapting what was originally a Chinese dish to suit the Japanese palate. “Ramen has been around in Japan since the Meiji era [1868-1912], but became particularly popular when it was served at food stalls after the war,” said Yamaji, who gets through 30 bowls a month and has been known to visit several ramen shops a day.\n\n“A distinctive feature of Japanese food culture is its ability to ‘localise’ dishes introduced from overseas … curry rice is a good example. In the same way, ramen has evolved into new food culture with a uniquely Japanese approach, like Tex-Mex cuisine in the US. It used to be considered cheap and filling, and it’s still convenient and inexpensive, but these days there is more emphasis on quality and fusion ingredients.”\n\nThe noodle dish with humble origins is now the yardstick by which Japan’s regions measure their culinary caché, triggering fierce rivalries and competing claims to have achieved the perfect marriage of soup, noodles and toppings. Varieties range from miso ramen in the far north, to those sitting in a pale but pungent pork-based broth in the deep south.\n\nThe roots of Yamagata’s obsession lie in the aftermath of the 1923 Great Kantō Earthquake, which killed more than 100,000 people in the Tokyo area. Ramen chefs who fled the destroyed capital to work at soba restaurants in Yamagata shared their ramen-making skills and found a population with an appetite for steaming hot noodles to get them through the city’s bitterly cold winters. Households would order ramen, rather than trays of sushi, to serve to guests – a custom that gave children an early introduction to a dish they continued to eat into adulthood.\n\nAfter it ceded its title to Niigata a few years ago, ramen shop owners and officials in Yamagata teamed up to create an organisation dedicated to re-establishing the city as Japan’s “ramen kingdom”.\n\nHiguchi is confident Yamagata will retain the title when the government announces the 2025 results in early February. “If our ramen businesses do well, then so does the local economy – farmers and soy sauce manufacturers, even the companies that produce hot towels for restaurants,” he says. “I don’t think it’s going too far to say that Yamagata is ramen.”",

    "fullText": "Deal indicates Venezuelan government is responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention\n\nDonald Trump has said Venezuela will be “turning over” $2bn worth of Venezuelan crude to the United States, a flagship negotiation that would divert supplies from China while helping Venezuela avoid deeper oil production cuts.\n\n“This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!” Trump said in a post online.\n\nVenezuelan government officials and state company PDVSA did not provide comment.\n\nVenezuela has millions of barrels of oil loaded on tankers and in storage tanks that it has been unable to ship due to the blockade imposed by Trump, as part of the pressure campaign that culminated in the toppling of Nicolás Maduro who was seized from his country by US forces over the weekend.\n\nTop Venezuelan officials have called Maduro’s capture a kidnapping and accused the US of trying to steal the country’s vast oil reserver, however Tuesday’s agreement is a strong sign that the government is responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention.\n\nTrump has said he wants interim president Delcy Rodríguez to give the US and private companies “total access” to Venezuela’s oil industry.\n\nUS energy secretary Chris Wright is in charge of executing the deal, Trump said, adding that the oil will be taken from ships and sent directly to US ports. Supplying the trapped crude to the US could initially require reallocating cargoes originally bound for China, two sources had told Reuters earlier on Tuesday.\n\nChina has been Venezuela’s top buyer in the last decade and especially since the United States imposed sanctions on companies involved in oil trade with Venezuela in 2020.\n\nUS crude prices fell more than 1.5% after Trump’s announcement, with the agreement expected to increase the volume of Venezuelan oil exported to the US. That flow of oil is currently controlled entirely by Chevron, PDVSA’s main joint venture partner, under a US authorisation.\n\nChevron, which has been exporting between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan oil to the US, is the only company that has been loading and shipping crude without interruption from the South American country in recent weeks under the blockade.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Venezuela would have any access to proceeds from the supply. Sanctions mean PDVSA is excluded from the global financial system, its bank accounts are frozen and it is blocked from executing transactions in US dollars\n\nHours before Trump’s announcement on Tuesday, Rodríguez hardened her tone against the US, saying in a televised address that “no external agent governs Venezuela” – a clear rebuttal to the US president’s claim that, after the capture of Maduro, the US would now run the South American country.\n\nIt marked another shift in tone from Maduro’s former vice-president. After being sworn in as president by Venezuela’s supreme court on Saturday, Rodríguez released a conciliatory statement late on Sunday in which she “invited the US government to work together on an agenda of cooperation”.\n\nIn Tuesday’s address, however, Rodríguez reverted to harsher language, describing Saturday’s strike – the first large-scale US military operation on South American soil – as a “terrible military aggression” and a “criminal attack” whose “absolutely illegal outcome, in violation of international law”, was the “kidnapping” of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.\n\n“We are a people who do not surrender, who do not give up, and we are here, governing together with the people. The government of Venezuela rules in our country – no one else. There is no external agent governing Venezuela. It is Venezuela, its constitutional government, and the consolidated power of the people,” said Rodríguez, who had served as Maduro’s vice-president since 2018.",

    "title": "Bill to Eliminate H-1B Visa Program Introduced in Congress",
    "description": "The bill introduced by Marjorie Taylor Greene would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to eliminate the H-1B visa program.",
    "fullText": "A bill that would \"eliminate the H-1B program,\" which helps U.S. companies hire highly skilled foreign workers, was among Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene's final two final pieces of proposed legislation, new records show.\n\nThe Republican of Georgia introduced the bill and another to mandate \"photo identification and proof of United States citizenship to vote in Federal elections\" on Friday.\n\nShe served her final day in Congress for Georgia's 14th district on Monday, following her a high-profile break with President Donald Trump over issues such as health care, the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files and foreign policy.\n\nThe H1-B visa program has been under heavy scrutiny during President Trump's second term.\n\nIn September, Trump ordered a controversial $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas, sparking ongoing legal challenges. In court papers, Trump's administration argued the substantial increase is necessary to protect American jobs and fund border security, while critics—including some business groups, educators and state governments—warned it would stifle innovation, competitiveness, and specialized fields like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and medicine.\n\nGreene's bill goes one step further than the government's position, seeking to end the program entirely.\n\nThe clash brings to the forefront the challenges Trump faces as he seeks to balance economic pragmatism with the “America First” sentiments of his political base, which Greene has argued are being ignored by Trump's administration.\n\nThe H-1B visa program allows employers to sponsor foreign professionals for jobs that require specialized skills, most commonly in technology, engineering, and science.\n\nEach year, the government issues 85,000 new H-1B visas, including 20,000 reserved for workers with advanced degrees from U.S. universities. Demand for the visas regularly exceeds supply, triggering an annual lottery. Indian nationals make up a large share of recipients.\n\nGreene first touted a H-1B program ban in September, writing on X: \"I am introducing a bill to END the mass replacement of American workers by aggressively phasing out the H1B program. Big Tech, AI giants, hospitals, and industries across the board have abused the H-1B system to cut out our own people. Americans are the most talented people in the world, and I have full faith in the American people. I serve Americans only, and I will ALWAYS put Americans first.\"\n\nRepresentative Beth Van Duyne, the Republican of Texas, last month also called for a total ban on the visas as part of a broader push to overhaul the U.S. immigration system, telling conservative commentator Benny Johnson politicians had overlooked the “unintended consequences” of programs like H-1B.\n\nMeanwhile, a federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration may proceed with imposing a $100,000 fee on new H1B visa applications. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which brought a legal challenge over concerns the fee would disrupt the framework established by Congress and impose high costs on U.S. businesses, last week launched an appeal over the ruling.\n\n\"These harms to American businesses will also be a boon to America’s economic rivals, who will surely welcome the talent no longer able to accept work in the United States,\" the business group said in its initial October lawsuit. \"That is a competitive edge that foreign employers might never cede back.\"\n\nSeparately, a coalition of 20 states, spearheaded by Washington Attorney General Nick Brown and California and Massachusetts' Attorneys General, challenged the fee’s legality under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), arguing the required notice-and-comment process was bypassed, and the fee was arbitrarily set unrelated to administrative costs.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State expanded its screening process for H-1B applicants and their dependents last month, requiring applicants to make social media accounts publicly accessible as part of routine vetting. Officials said the move was aimed at preventing abuse of the system.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has finalized new rules that will reshape the H-1B visa lottery. Beginning in 2027, applicants would no longer have equal chances of selection; instead, the system would prioritize higher-paid workers within each occupation. Federal officials said the change is intended to favor highly skilled applicants and respond to concerns about visa misuse and the displacement of U.S. workers.\n\nRepresentative Beth Van Duyne, the Republican of Texas, told conservative commentator Benny Johnson on December 17: “That H-1B visa program has got to either stop right now until we understand the amount of just how it’s being taken advantage of, or redone so it doesn't exist.\"\n\nStuart Anderson, executive director at the National Foundation for American Policy, responding to a decline in the number of H-1B visas approved for Indian-based companies, according to a National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) analysis of government data, told Newsweek: \"H-1B visas are important because they are typically the only way to hire a high-skilled foreign national long term in the United States, and approximately 70% of full-time graduate students in key science and technology fields at U.S. schools are international students.”\n\nUnited States Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesperson Matthew Tragesser, in a December 23 press release announcing H-1B lotttery changes: \"The new weighted selection will better serve Congress’ intent for the H-1B program and strengthen America’s competitiveness by incentivizing American employers to petition for higher-paid, higher-skilled foreign workers. With these regulatory changes and others in the future, we will continue to update the H-1B program to help American businesses without allowing the abuse that was harming American workers.”\n\nGreen's amendment has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee, along with the Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means committees.",

    "description": "Mammals aren’t known for the ocular regenerative powers, but a new study shows that nature has a few tricks up its sleeve.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this study:\n\nBillions of people globally experience some kind of vision impairment, with many millions living with near or total blindness. With such an astounding number of people functionally lacking our most primary sense for navigating through the world, scientists have eagerly pursued methods to restore human vision. But while other members of the animal kingdom display remarkable methods of vision regeneration, mammals largely lack these restorative powers.\n\nHowever, we might not be completely without biological advantages, and scientists hope that understanding the ways our body does restore some level of vision after injury could lead to therapies for vision-based maladies.\n\nWithin the human body, it’s mostly seen as a given that neurons do not regenerate once damage. But this didn’t explain how people appeared to regain some ability, including vision, after a traumatic injury. To investigate, scientists from Johns Hopkins University in Maryland explored what happens between connections of cells in the visual system and neurons in the brain in mice after an injury. While neurons didn’t regrow, the researchers did notice that surviving cells increased branching, allowing for more connections in the brain. Eventually, this branching process—known as “sprouting”—resulted in nearly the same number of connections as before the injury. The results of this study were published in the journal JNeurosci.\n\n“The central nervous system is characterized by its limited regenerative potential, yet striking examples of functional recovery after injury in animal models and humans highlight its capacity for repair,” the authors wrote. “Here we […] explore, for the first time, the evolution of structural and functional changes in the terminal fields of the injured visual system.”\n\nWhile the mice in the study did recover to an extent, the scientists were surprised to see that recovery wasn’t uniform across sexes. Male mice showed enhanced recuperative abilities, while female mice experienced slower and incomplete repair by comparison. While an unexplained discovery, the phenomenon isn’t wholly unexpected.\n\n“Women experience more lingering symptoms from concussion or brain injury than men,” Johns Hopkins University’s Athanasios Alexandris, the lead author of the study, said in a press statement. “Understanding the mechanism behind the branch sprouting we observed—and what delays or prevents this mechanism in females—could eventually point toward strategies to promote recovery from traumatic or other forms of neural injury.”\n\nWhile the mammalian body offers effective strategies for restoring vision, scientists are looking across the entire animal kingdom for methods of ocular regeneration. In August of 2025, scientists reported on the inner genetic workings of the apple snail’s eye-restoring abilities, and a few months prior, another team achieved partial vision restoration in mice by leveraging the evolutionary strategies of zebrafish.\n\nFor now, humans lack methods for fully regenerating cells that can completely restore our much-needed vision. But scientists are eagerly hunting for clues to unlock this biological secret—whether in far-flung phylums or within our own bodies.\n\nDarren lives in Portland, has a cat, and writes/edits about sci-fi and how our world works.

    "description": "\"Projected to face severe climatic challenges.\"",
    "fullText": "New research has found that birds that have adapted to mountainous regions may be at risk amid a shifting climate, but hybridized birds with genes from multiple species could have a better chance of adapting.\n\nA study led by researchers at the Institute of Zoology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and published in the journal Nature Climate Change, analyzed three closely related bird species that live in the Sino-Himalayan mountains, as detailed in an academy report posted by Phys.org.\n\nThe researchers ran simulations and found that if these birds mate and produce hybrid offspring, it could reduce their vulnerability to climate change over several generations. This could help them adapt to harsher conditions and future climate shifts.\n\nThese bird species began diverging 220,000 years ago, according to the study, and live in distinct niches within the same region. Because of those contrasting environments, they have adapted unique survival mechanisms — yet they are all still under threat.\n\n\"Despite these specializations, all three species are projected to face severe climatic challenges, potentially losing 44% to 69% of their suitable habitats,\" the authors said, per Phys.org, sharing the academy report.\n\nThe birds have been mostly geographically isolated, but some contact zones exist that could make hybridization possible.\n\nEven with their adaptations to their environments and the potential for hybrid species to carry multiple beneficial genetic traits, they are still vulnerable to climate shifts — though hybrid birds are projected as less so than nonhybridized counterparts.\n\nThe rapid warming of the planet is changing human beings, wildlife, and the environment as we know it. This research provides another example of how animals are being forced to adapt to changing conditions.\n\nWarmer temperatures are melting ice in the Arctic and on mountains, shrinking habitats, and depleting resources for wildlife.\n\nAnimals can change their migration patterns and venture outside their normal regions to search for food and habitable climates, throwing off ecological balance in the process.\n\nDo you worry about the longevity of EV batteries?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"Climate change is rapidly driving environmental shifts, posing an increasing threat to global biodiversity,\" the authors said in the study.\n\nIt's not a good sign that mountainous birds may have to use hybridization to survive the effects of climate change over the long term, but it's important for researchers to know what's possible in order to save vital ecosystems.\n\nThe study urged better preservation of migration corridors and contact zones for these birds, which help to facilitate \"interspecific genetic material exchange\" for \"restoring population fitness.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "\"A higher ratio than generally reported.\"",
    "fullText": "It was shorts weather for Santa as parts of Iceland set record high temperatures this past Christmas Eve. Air that originated in the tropics swept across the country, helping temperatures in places surge to nearly 70 degrees on December 24.\n\nSeyðisfjörður, on the east coast of Iceland, reached a record high of 19.8 degrees Celsius (about 67.6 degrees Fahrenheit) the day before Christmas, reported The Guardian. It broke the previous record for Iceland, set on December 2, 2019, when the high reached 19.7 Celsius (about 67.5 Fahrenheit) in Öræfi, about 125 miles to the southwest of Seyðisfjörður, as the crow flies.\n\n\"This is incredibly warm for winter,\" meteorologist Einar Sveinbjörnsson posted on Facebook, per RÚV, Iceland's national public broadcasting service. \"Another station in Seyðisfjörður, located north of the head of the fjord in Vestdalur, recorded 19.4 C [about 66.9 F]. There is no reason to question these measurements.\"\n\nA \"foehn wind\" contributed to the unusual holiday heat records in Iceland, RÚV detailed. \"Foehn winds represent a special type of local wind associated with mountain systems,\" explains the National Weather Service in an online publication. \"In most mountainous areas, local winds are observed that blow over the mountain ranges and descend the slopes on the leeward side. If the down-flowing wind is warm and dry, it is called a foehn wind.\"\n\nWhile a foehn wind played a part in setting a new record high for December 24 in Iceland, a warming climate at high northern latitudes is making it easier to break records.\n\nRecords fell in Iceland this past spring too, as temperatures in some areas climbed by as much as 3 to 4 degrees Celsius (roughly 5 to 7 degrees Fahrenheit) higher than normal in May, according to The Guardian. The temperature peaked at 26.6 Celsius (about 79.9 Fahrenheit) at Egilsstaðir Airport in East Iceland on May 15.\n\nIndividual temperature records aren't alone proof of historical trends, but scientific consensus holds that human activities have raised average temperatures worldwide — and continue to do so. The effects of this warming include amplified extreme weather events that can endanger lives and livelihoods.\n\nOnly part of Iceland is north of the Arctic Circle, but our overheating planet is also having a huge impact on the Arctic, with effects spilling out into other parts of the world. Scientists say the region is warming rapidly compared to the rest of the planet.\n\n\"In recent decades, the warming in the Arctic has been much faster than in the rest of the world, a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification,\" concluded a 2022 study on the warming observed in the Arctic since 1979.\n\n\"Numerous studies report that the Arctic is warming either twice, more than twice, or even three times as fast as the globe on average,\" added the authors of that research. \"[We] show, by using several observational datasets which cover the Arctic region, that during the last 43 years the Arctic has been warming nearly four times faster than the globe, which is a higher ratio than generally reported in literature.\"\n\nAccording to the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Information's November global climate report, the Arctic had its fifth-warmest November on record, with temperatures more than 6 degrees Fahrenheit above average. At just over 5 degrees Fahrenheit above average, the period from January through November was the second-warmest such period on record for the region.\n\nHow worried are you about rising ocean levels?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nNOAA's 2025 Arctic report card highlighted several ways our warming world is impacting the region, including \"permafrost thaw influencing river chemistry, northward ocean heat transport reshaping Arctic marine ecosystems, and widespread warming leading to borealization of Arctic waters and landscapes.\"\n\n\"Transformations over the next twenty years will reshape Arctic environments and ecosystems, impact the wellbeing of Arctic residents, and influence the trajectory of the global climate system itself, which we all depend on,\" warned the authors of the report card.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "A Caracas highway is choked with cars.",
    "fullText": "A Caracas highway is choked with cars.\n\nBut far from typical rush hour traffic, Avenida Boyacá, a highway running alongside El Avila National Park in Venezuela’s capital, has ground to a halt because masked men holding Kalashnikovs are stopping drivers and demanding to search their phones and cars.\n\nThe gangs of armed men, part of pro-Maduro militias known as Colectivos, scoured vehicles at hastily erected checkpoints following a government directive to root out Venezuelans in support of the US’s brazen capture of Nicolás Maduro.\n\nDays after the sudden decapitation of the Maduro regime, Venezuelans have been left fearing what could come next as mobs of men dressed in civilian clothes with assault rifles slung over their shoulders roam the streets.\n\n“The future is uncertain, the Colectivos have weapons, the Colombian guerrilla is already here in Venezuela, so we don’t know what’s going to happen, time will tell,” Oswaldo, a 69-year-old Venezuelan shop owner, told The Telegraph.\n\nA state of emergency decree published on Monday has sought to crack down on any public celebration of the US operation. It ordered police to “immediately begin the national search and capture of everyone involved in the promotion or support for the armed attack by the United States”.\n\nOne Venezuelan, who wished to remain anonymous, said she would no longer leave the house with her phone over fears it could be scoured for anti-Maduro texts or photographs, which could lead to her imprisonment.\n\nThe paramilitaries have already arrested 14 journalists and media workers – 11 from foreign news outlets – for hours before releasing some of them. The whereabouts of other journalists are unknown.\n\nThe presence of Colectivos, armed men who ride around on motorcycles and are used as an unofficial government arm of repression, suggests that Maduro loyalists are desperately attempting to maintain their grip on the country.\n\nVideos circulating on social media shows armed men declaring they would not allow Donald Trump and US “pigs” to come in and plunder the country’s natural resources.\n\nAnother video shows interior minister Diosdado Cabello, Mr Maduro’s closest ally, posing with a crowd of the armed militia as they shouted: “Always loyal, never traitors.”\n\nMr Cabello, who has a $50m bounty on his head for drug trafficking charges, largely controls the Colectivos.\n\nAs Mr Maduro pleaded his innocence and claimed he was a “prisoner of war” during his arraignment at Manhattan Federal Court, armed supporters said his heart and soul remained in Venezuela.\n\n“There’s enough people here, there’s enough balls here to fight for this revolution, to fight for this motherland,” said a man who identified himself as Freddy Rodriguez, a member of Cupaz, a network set up by Maduro in 2019 to control protests.\n\nOn Monday morning, most shops and businesses had reopened in Caracas and the long queues of panicked Venezuelans trying to buy provisions had dissipated.\n\nPolice and intelligence officers lined the streets in the centre of Caracas, with two main avenues closed as Delcy Rodriguez, Mr Maduro’s vice president, was sworn in by her brother, National Assembly leader Jorge Rodrigue.\n\n“I come with sorrow for the suffering inflicted upon the Venezuelan people following an illegitimate military aggression against our homeland,” she said while holding up her right hand.\n\n“I come with sorrow for the kidnapping of two heroes.”\n\nHer comments struck a different tone than on Sunday when she said she had “invited the US government to work together on an agenda of co-operation” in the wake of Mr Trump’s warning that she would pay a “very big price” should she not do as instructed.\n\nIn Caracas, Venezuelans who had initially welcomed Maduro’s capture, hoping it would lead to real change in the country, were left feeling deflated by Ms Rodriguez’s ascension and the continuation of Mr Maduro’s regime.\n\nThe country’s constitution requires an election within 30 days whenever the president becomes “permanently unavailable” to serve. However, the Supreme Court declared Mr Maduro’s absence a “temporary” one.\n\nIn such a scenario, the vice president takes over for up to 90 days – a period that can be extended to six months with a vote of the National Assembly.\n\nMaría Corina Machado, the Venezuelan Opposition leader and recent winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, said the crackdown by the militia was “really alarming” and that the country’s transition to democracy needed to happen.\n\n“Delcy Rodriguez, as you know, is one of the main architects of torture, persecution, corruption, narco-trafficking,” Ms Machado told Fox News. “She’s a main ally and liaison of ‍Russia, China, Iran, certainly not an individual who could be trusted by international investors and she’s really rejected by the Venezuelan people.”\n\nThere has been no discussion of holding democratic elections and the future of the country still hangs in the balance.\n\n“I wanted a change in government because these people have done a lot of damage to the country; they forgot they were public servants, they thought they owned the country,” shopkeeper Oswaldo said.\n\n“But now we’re at the same point, he has left and another has replaced him – Delcy Rodriguez, Diosdado Cabello and Vladimir Padrino López – they’re all still here.”\n\nSpeaking to The Telegraph in Plaza Altamira while she waited for a job interview, Aurora said she had hoped for a regime change but said her main concern was putting food on the table.\n\n“Most international leaders don’t agree with what happened, but it happened.\n\n“We saw it coming, everybody saw it coming, but nobody imagined it would happen like this, so violent. Some wished for it and others not, but there is not one country in the world that can interfere in the government and say the oil is mine, no, this is a lie, this belongs to the Venezuelan people.”\n\nWhile she pushed back at Mr Trump’s suggestion he would “run” Venezuela, Aurora, a care worker from Petare, said: “We needed a change and it was necessary and now we need a transition.”\n\n“Every birth involves pain and now we have to move forward,” she added.\n\nOthers were less accepting of the current situation.\n\n“Honestly, I think this should not have happened; he [Maduro] should be in his country governing his country,” a 59-year-old sports coach, who requested to remain anonymous, said.\n\n“All I wish for Venezuela is for things to be calm, we’ve been through so much already... I know that we weren’t well, but emotionally and physically we were more at peace.”\n\nThe thought of Mr Trump deciding what comes next for Venezuelans, as opposed to holding fair elections, has left many concerned.\n\n“I don’t agree with what Trump said, he said he was coming to run our country – I want a transition, I want elections,” Oswaldo said.\n\n“If the majority of people are in favour of Delcy, fine, if it is a transparent election and we will recognise the results peacefully – if the Chavismo wins, then ok, but if the opposition wins, they will have to recognise their defeat.”\n\nJournalists in Caracas contributed to this report but asked to withhold their names for fear of reprisals from the regime\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "For retirees, moving abroad can sound like a dream.\n\nImagine beaches, cobblestone streets and a cost of living that stretches your Social Security check further than it ever could at home. However, finding a place that’s both affordable and safe is harder than it looks.\n\nSo, I asked ChatGPT to run the numbers: Which countries offer the best balance of low cost of living and personal security?\n\nUsing the 2025 Global Peace Index, Numbeo’s Cost of Living Index, and U.S. State Department travel advisories, the AI highlighted a handful of countries that might make sense for a stress-free retirement overseas.\n\nPortugal remains one of Europe’s safest destinations. However, it’s not as inexpensive as it once was. Rising housing prices and new residency rules mean retirees need a realistic budget and proof of income.\n\nThe D7 visa still works for retirees with passive income. Applicants will have to prove they consistently earn about €870 per month (roughly $900 USD) and provide evidence of stable finances and housing, according to the residency consultancy Global Citizen Solutions.\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, smaller inland towns can offer a comfortable lifestyle for $1,500 to $2,000 per month, while Lisbon or Algarve coastal areas often cost $2,500 to $3,500. Even with higher prices, Portugal’s healthcare, safety and walkability make it appealing for retirees seeking European quality of life.\n\nTrending Now: I Asked ChatGPT for Safe and Beautiful Retirement Spots on $2.5K a Month — These 7 Surprised Me\n\nConsider This: 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up To $1K per Month From Home\n\nAI said Malaysia delivers one of the best cost-to-quality ratios in Asia. In Kuala Lumpur or Penang, a couple can live well on $1,500 to $2,000 per month and enjoy modern healthcare at a fraction of U.S. costs.\n\nThe Malaysia My Second Home (MM2H) program allows long-term residency for those meeting income or savings requirements, making it a leading pick for safety and affordability.\n\nSlovenia offers postcard landscapes, European healthcare and high safety rankings at a lower cost of living than Western Europe.\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, a retiree can live modestly on about $2,000 a month, enjoy a high standard of public services, and easily travel throughout Europe.\n\nChatGPT said Uruguay stands out in South America for its political stability, low violent-crime rate and well-run healthcare system.",

    "fullText": "Shasta Lake, the largest reservoir in California, rose more than 30 feet over the past two weeks as a series of winter storms pounded the state, according to state data.\n\nThe heavy inflow over the holidays, with Shasta Lake rising 10 feet alone between Friday and Monday, pushed water levels at the sprawling Northern California reservoir to nearly 80% of capacity, which is well above what it typically holds this early in the rainy season. And the runoff is still coming in, albeit at a slower rate.\n\nCalifornia reservoir levels: Charts show water supply across the state\n\nWhile winter is still young and California's water picture won't be clear for months, the recent replenishment of Shasta Lake, as well as other major reservoirs, is welcome news for cities and farms across the state, which rely on the water that fills these giant storage facilities between fall and spring.\n\n\"Reservoirs on the whole are running ahead of average, which is good,\" said Michael Anderson, state climatologist at the California Department of Water Resources, in a report Tuesday to the State Water Resources Control Board.\n\nPrior to the holidays, water managers were getting nervous after a mostly dry start to the state's peak wet season, which runs from December to March. But starting just before Christmas, an extremely wet pattern locked in, bringing more than a foot of rain and several feet of snow to parts of California over a two-week period.\n\n\"Right around the Christmas holiday, we had over 100 hours of atmospheric river conditions in the state,\" Anderson said.\n\nAs a result, water storage at Shasta Lake climbed to 132% of average for the date, as of Monday. Storage at Lake Oroville, the state's second-largest reservoir, rose to 135% of average. Storage at Trinity Lake, the state's third-largest reservoir, hit 137% of average.\n\nHetch Hetchy Reservoir in Yosemite, which is San Francisco's primary storage facility, meanwhile, held 130% of the water it typically holds on this date.\n\nMany reservoirs have been making releases to ensure adequate space for the lingering precipitation and continuing runoff. Shasta Lake's waters were about 35 feet below the rim of the reservoir.\n\n\"We are on the receding limb of inflows with these latest systems,\" said Levi Johnson, an operations manager at the federal Bureau of Reclamation, which manages Shasta Lake. \"This will be a dynamic operation in terms of what kind of releases we have.\"\n\nThe storms appear to be mostly on their way out. The National Weather Service is forecasting dry conditions for at least the next two weeks.\n\nWhile California's water picture remains strong, water managers will be watching to see how long it is before the next rain and snow arrives and whether it's enough to maintain robust reservoir storage.\n\nAnother factor that water managers are monitoring is snowfall in the state's far north. While California's total snowpack stands at 90% of average for the date, the northern Sierra and southern Cascades are at just 67%.\n\nSnow is important, particularly in Northern California where the state's biggest reservoirs are located, because it melts and provides a source of water for reservoirs after the rainy season ends.\n\n\"We've had a lot more rain than snow,\" Anderson said.\n\nThis article originally published at California's largest reservoir surges 30 feet after recent storms.",

Police have impounded the vehicle and are serving search warrants on it as part of the ongoing investigation into the accident, Erie Police Chief Rick Lorah said Jan. 6.\n\nPolice have not identified a suspected driver, and no one had been charged in the accident as of Jan. 6.\n\nErie police have searched for the vehicle since the evening of Dec. 9, when 66-year-old Richard Gaska was struck while riding a bicycle in the area of West Eighth and Liberty streets. Investigators said the vehicle that struck Gaska was believed to have been traveling east on West Eighth Street.\n\nThe driver of the vehicle did not stop and drove off after the accident, which police said was reported at 6:53 p.m. Dec. 9.

    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS, Nevada, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Tuesday he does not believe China's government will make a formal declaration that it has allowed Chinese firms to import the U.S. company's ​H200 chips but that evidence will come through purchase orders.\n\n\"My expectation is that we're not expecting any press releases or ‌any large declarations,\" Huang said, after saying that demand for the H200 chips was strong among Chinese customers.\n\n\"It's just going to be purchase orders. If the purchase ‌orders come, it's because they're able to place purchase orders,\" Huang said during a press conference at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump last year reversed a longstanding ban on shipping advanced artificial intelligence chips to China, saying he would allow Nvidia to sell the H200, which was the predecessor to its current flagship \"Blackwell\" chips.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday in an interview with a JPMorgan analyst, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress ⁠said that the U.S. government is \"working feverishly\" ‌on license applications for Nvidia to ship its H200 chips to China, but that the company still does not know when they will be approved.\n\n\"We're going to wait and see what will happen,\" Kress said ‍of the applications.\n\nAt the press conference, Huang said that Nvidia is ramping up H200 chips for Chinese firms.\n\n\"The customer demand is high - quite high,\" Huang said. \"We've fired up our supply chain, and H200s are flowing through the line.\"\n\nOn Monday, Nvidia showed a sextet of new chips that it said are in ​full production to form the next \"Vera Rubin\" generation of its AI computing systems. Kress declined to say whether Nvidia was facing any ‌specific bottlenecks as it ramps up production but said \"we feel very solid\" about the state of its supply chain.\n\nNvidia has called for $500 billion in sales from its current \"Blackwell\" generation as well as the forthcoming Vera Rubin chips by the end of this year. Kress said there have \"already been discussions\" about data center buildouts with customers for 2027 but did not give sales guidance.\n\nHuang said demand is high for Nvidia products across the board.\n\n\"I'm fully expecting a really giant year for our business with TSMC,\" Huang said, referring to Taiwan Semiconductor ⁠Manufacturing Co, which makes most of Nvidia's chips.\n\nHuang also said that he plans ​a visit soon to Israel, where the company has 5,000 employees and is ​looking to double its workforce. Local media reported last month that Nvidia is in talks to buy Israeli firm AI21 Labs.",

The funds returned 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively, in December.\n\nThe firm's smaller Emerging Markets strategy was a bright spot, returning more than 15% over the year after a 1.6% gain in December, the person added. That strategy manages roughly $1 billion in assets. Brevan declined to comment.\n\nLast year was a banner year for many macro-oriented firms. Bridgewater generated the most profits in its decades of trading, a person close to the Connecticut-based fund told Business Insider, as its flagship Pure Alpha fund was up 33% in 2025. Additionally, the manager's All Weather fund was up more than 20% for the year.\n\nDiscovery Capital, the macro fund run by former Tiger Management investor Rob Citrone, returned 35.6% in 2025, a person close to the manager said. D.E. Shaw's macro-oriented fund Oculus was up more than 28% in 2025, an individual familiar with the New York-based giant said.\n\nThe managers declined to comment.\n\nMacro investors had plenty of geopolitical turmoil to trade off of in 2025. Ripple effects from President Donald Trump's tariff policies, conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, and central bank decisions provided both stress and opportunities for funds.\n\nThis year is expected to be more of the same following Trump's decision to invade Venezuela and extradite the country's president, Nicolás Maduro, at the start of the year.",

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comments.\n\nThe current interim leader of Venezuela is Delcy Rodríguez, who was sworn in as acting president on January 5, 2026, after the US captured and detained the country's former President Nicolás Maduro, alongside his wife. Rodríguez is a longtime Maduro loyalist and originally served as the Vice President of Venezuela. She has so far not spoken out on whether she would cooperate with Trump's plan.\n\nTrump's comments build on his previous remarks that he would \"take back\" Venezuela's oil reserves and revive the country's battered energy sector, which has faced sanctions and mismanagement.\n\nTrump also previously said in an interview with NBC News that the US could reimburse American oil companies for expanding their operations in Venezuela, but he did not have an estimate on how much the subsidy would cost.\n\nEven though a larger supply could lead to lower costs for American consumers, the downward pressure on prices could disincentivize large oil companies from investing in Venezuela. It could also take years to build functioning infrastructure.\n\nVenezuela's oil production currently accounts for less than 1% of the global oil output, despite possessing the world's largest known oil reserves.",

    "fullText": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang seems like he's not losing sleep over California's proposed wealth tax.\n\nWhen Bloomberg TV's Ed Ludlow asked Huang about California's proposed 5% billionaire wealth tax in an interview that aired on Tuesday, Huang said that the potential levy hasn't crossed his mind once and that he is \"trying to build the future of AI.\"\n\n\"I've got to tell you, I have not even thought about it once,\" Huang told Ludlow. \"We chose to live in Silicon Valley, and whatever taxes they would like to apply, so be it. I'm perfectly fine with it.\"\n\n\"We work in Silicon Valley because that's where the talent pool is,\" Huang added.\n\nHuang is the eighth-wealthiest person in the world according to Forbes, which estimated his net worth at approximately $162.6 billion as of January 6. Most of Huang's wealth comes from his around 3% stake in Nvidia, which just showed off its new Vera Rubin chips at the Consumer Electronics Show.\n\nBased on his net worth as reported by Forbes, a 5% tax on his total wealth would amount to more than $8 billion, to be paid over five years, according to the proposed plan.\n\nThe California wealth tax was proposed by the SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West in order to offset anticipated budget cuts to healthcare, education, and food assistance.\n\nA wealth tax is different from an income tax and is a levy on an individual's entire net worth instead of annual income. The union estimates that the one-time tax will bring in $100 billion over five years for the state and apply to the around 200 billionaires who are residents of California.\n\nThe proposal is still very far from reality and would need 870,000 signatures to even make it to the ballot in November 2026, where it would then be voted on or rejected by California voters.\n\nBillionaires from Palmer Luckey to David Sacks have already voiced their full-throated disapproval.\n\nAccording to filings viewed by Business Insider, Larry Page, the Google cofounder, converted many of his assets from California to Delaware in December to derisk them from the potential wealth tax. His departure meets an end-of-2025 deadline, since the tax, if passed, would only apply to billionaires who are still residents of California on January 1, 2026.\n\nCelebrity attorney Alex Spiro wrote a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom on behalf of his wealthy clients and warned that they would \"permanently relocate\" if the California billionaire tax comes to pass.\n\nNvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "The companies behind some of tech's least glamorous products — hard drives and storage — are powering a sharp rally on Wall Street.\n\nThe surge comes after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at CES 2026 on Monday that the AI boom isn't just about chips, but about where vast amounts of data live.\n\nSanDisk, the flash-memory company spun out of Western Digital last year, has been the standout. Its shares surged about 28% on Tuesday, marking their strongest intraday performance since February. The stock is already up more than 40% just days into January, making SanDisk the top performer in the S&P 500 on Tuesday.\n\nWestern Digital and Seagate Technology, two of the world's largest makers of hard-disk drives, are also seeing a boost. Western Digital's shares jumped about 17% on Tuesday, while Seagate rose about 14%.\n\nHuang described the memory storage market as a \"completely unserved market today.\"\n\n\"This market will likely be the largest storage market in the world, basically holding the working memory of the world's AIs,\" he said at CES with analysts on Monday.\n\n\"The amount of context memory, the amount of token memory that we process, KB cache we process, is now just way too high,\" he added, referring to AI storage needs.\n\nMemory prices have been rising. Korea Economic Daily reported on Monday that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are pushing for server DRAM price increases of 60% to 70% in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter.\n\nMarket analysis firm Counterpoint said last week that memory prices could rise by 40% through the second quarter of 2026, as AI-driven demand continues to strain supply.\n\nThe AI race has largely been about chips, data centers, and power. But data storage is coming into focus as a key bottleneck.\n\nDriven largely by AI workloads, the volume of stored global data was expected to top 200 zettabytes in 2025 — the equivalent of 200 billion terabytes.\n\nAnalysts have predicted that demand for data storage could run ahead of supply.\n\n\"The memory market is at an unprecedented inflexion point, with demand materially outpacing supply,\" an analyst from global market intelligence firm International Data Corporation wrote in a December note.\n\n\"For an industry that has long been characterized by boom-and-bust cycles, this time is different,\" the analyst said, citing the rapid build-out of AI infrastructure and workloads as a shift that is straining the memory ecosystem.\n\n\"For consumers and enterprises alike, this signals the end of an era of cheap, abundant memory and storage, at least in the medium term,\" the analyst added.",

So, I used to do anything and everything not to say the thing that would make the waters choppy,\" Paltrow told host Amy Poehler.\n\nOver time, the Goop founder said she realized the approach was causing more problems than it prevented.\n\n\"When you don't say what needs to be said in the moment to spare somebody else's feelings, first of all, like, you're rejecting the truest part of yourself,\" Paltrow said.\n\n\"And then it's going to come out another way. And that's like, you'll end up being dishonest. You'll end up not saying what needs to be said. You'll end up stringing out some lame relationship for eight extra months and treating them not so nicely because you have stuck yourself in something, you know, you just make a mess,\" she said.\n\nThe \"Marty Supreme\" actor said she eventually reached a point where she knew she had to do something differently, and that was around the time she turned 40.\n\n\"I worked with a coach on how to hold the uncomfortable feelings of disappointing somebody else,\" Paltrow said. \"I really had a problem with men.

    "fullText": "Elon Musk says China is on track to outpace every other country in the computing power needed to run AI.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO said in an episode of the \"Moonshots with Peter Diamandis\" podcast published Tuesday that \"China's going to have more power than anyone else and probably will have more chips.\"\n\n\"Based on current trends, China will far exceed the rest of the world in AI compute,\" he added.\n\nMusk said China's decisive advantage in the AI race lies in its ability to scale electricity generation. He estimated that China could reach about three times the electricity output of the US by 2026, giving it the capacity to support energy-hungry AI data centers.\n\nElectricity generation is the limiting factor to scaling AI systems, Musk said.\n\n\"People are underestimating the difficulty of bringing electricity online,\" he added.\n\nWhile the US has focused on restricting China's access to advanced semiconductors, Musk suggested those constraints may matter less over time. China will \"figure out the chips,\" he said.\n\nMusk added that diminishing returns at the cutting edge of chip performance might make it easier for China to catch up, even without access to the most advanced designs.\n\nMusk has previously pointed to China as a model in areas beyond AI infrastructure.\n\nIn an episode of the \"People by WTF\" podcast published in November, Musk said he wants to turn his social media platform X into \"WeChat++,\" referencing China's dominant super app.\n\n\"I also like the idea of sort of having a unified app or website or whatever, where you can do anything you want there,\" he said. \"China has this with WeChat.\"\n\nMusk's comments come as energy supply and data infrastructure emerge as key constraints in scaling AI, rather than chips or algorithms.\n\nCompanies worldwide have rushed to build AI data centers, many of which require as much electrical power as small cities.\n\nA report from Goldman Sachs in November said that an electricity shortage could slow US progress in the AI race.\n\n\"As AI demands massive power, a reliable and ample power supply is likely to be a key factor shaping this race, especially because power infrastructure bottlenecks can be slow to solve,\" wrote Goldman's analysts.\n\nThe report added that while pressure on the US power grid is increasing, China has been steadily expanding its energy capacity.\n\n\"We expect China's spare capacity to remain sufficient to accommodate data center power demand growth while supporting demand in other industries,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nIn his annual New Year's address last week, Chinese leader Xi Jinping praised his country's progress in AI in 2025, saying China had \"integrated science and technology deeply with industries, and made a stream of new innovations.\"\n\n\"Many large AI models have been competing in a race to the top, and breakthroughs have been achieved in the research and development of our own chips,\" he said in his speech in Beijing.\n\n\"All this has turned China into one of the economies with the fastest-growing innovation capabilities,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "Not all American energy companies stand to benefit from a potential revival of Venezuela's oil industry following the US's capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.\n\nEnergy stocks rose on Monday as investors priced in potential gains from renewed US access to Venezuela's massive oil reserves. But analysts say smaller companies could struggle to benefit from a recovery in the country's energy sector.\n\nAdditional Venezuelan oil supply over the coming years could be \"negative for shale producers\" that don't have a footprint in Venezuela, Daan Struyven, the head of oil research at Goldman Sachs, said on the firm's \"Exchanges\" podcast, published on Tuesday.\n\nThat's because prices and volumes could come under pressure if supply growth over the next five to 10 years comes from Venezuela rather than from US shale, he added.\n\nThe potential strain on shale reflects a key difference in oil quality. Venezuelan crude is heavy and sulfur-rich, while US shale production is dominated by lighter oil. Many US Gulf Coast refineries were originally designed to process heavier crude, making Venezuelan barrels a better fit.\n\nGreater access to Venezuelan crude could therefore benefit refiners while undermining demand for lighter shale barrels.\n\nWhile light shale oil and heavy crude like Venezuela's are not directly interchangeable, increased supplies of heavy oil can still reshape refinery demand and pricing across the broader market. That kind of change would indirectly pressure US shale producers, who have long been the engine of America's shale revolution.\n\n\"In the US, the first casualties would likely be some oil producers, particularly smaller shale firms with high debt and thin margins,\" Philippe Le Billon, a professor at the University of British Columbia who studies the political economy of natural resources, wrote in The Conversation on Sunday.\n\nFurthermore, oil prices have already been under pressure in recent years due to ample supply and sluggish demand growth.\n\nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude futures are trading around $56 a barrel, while Brent futures are around $60 a barrel. Both are down around 2% so far this year after falling 20% last year.\n\nEven an increase in Venezuela's oil production in the medium term could put downward pressure on oil prices, making it harder for higher-cost US shale producers to justify new drilling, researchers at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy said in a Sunday post.\n\nThat dynamic could intensify the pressure on US shale producers.\n\n\"This complicates the notion that the US would unambiguously 'win' from a Venezuelan oil revival. Energy geopolitics creates winners and losers on all sides,\" wrote Le Billon.",

    "title": "CES 2026: This Tiny Computer Is like a Mac Mini for PC Users",
    "description": "Lenovo's Yoga Mini i actually has a useful power button.",
    "fullText": "Mini PCs are great for people who want minimal desk setups, but aside from the Mac Mini, they're not really something that appeals to the average user. Most are boring and still-slightly-chunky boxes, come from lesser-known companies like Geekom, and are built either for enterprise or thrifty gamers. What's a Windows user who doesn't want to swap to Apple to do? This year, Lenovo's launching a new Mini PC with some of that Apple sleekness, to try to fill that niche.\n\nUnveiled at CES, the Lenovo Yoga Mini i is a cute little circle that fits in the palm of your hand and weighs just about 1.3 pounds (with small variations depending on how you configure it). A slightly textured, silvery-gray paint job covers the entirety of the device, and ports are generous but stay in dedicated areas on either the rear or side of the device. The rear's got slots for an ethernet port, a USB-A cable, an HDMI cable, and three USB-C cables, with one set aside for power, one for Thunderbolt 4 accessories, and one for all the rest. The side has a 3.5mm headphone jack (thank goodness) and another Thunderbolt 4 port.\n\nIt's an overall attractive appearance, which is important when you're selling something based on form factor, but the kicker is that the power button is actually on the side of the device. It sounds simple, but that's bound to drive people who bought the latest Mac Mini, which has its power button underneath the computer, crazy with envy. Better yet? That power button also doubles as a fingerprint reader for easy sign-ins.\n\nSpecs wise, it comes decked out with the latest Intel Core Ultra X series AI chips, up to 32GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of storage. It also features a WiFi 7 adapter, two speakers, and even a microphone built-in, for zippy internet connectivity and easy audio calls. That's more than enough performance for the average person, and probably even outclasses my years-old full-size desktop. Don't expect to play the latest games at max settings on it, but this should be roughly equivalent to a high-end productivity laptop if you go for its most powerful configuration options.\n\nTo push it over the edge, the Yoga Mini i also has its own \"one more thing.\" There's actually an accelerometer with a touch sensor inside this thing, so it can work with Lenovo's Smart Connect ecosystem. The company says you can use this to take calls by tapping on the PC, use certain touch gestures to adjust the Yoga Mini's performance mode, or use a customizable double tap to do other actions, like calling up an AI chatbot.\n\nTaken all together, the smooth appearance, user-friendly design tweaks, and tiny size make for probably the closest thing I've seen to a Windows version of the Mac Mini yet—and that goes for the pricing, too. The Yoga Mini i will start at $700, which is $100 more than the base Mac Mini, but is still pretty affordable for those kind of specs in the middle of a memory shortage. Lenovo hasn't said how expensive it could get if you go for extra storage or RAM, too, and it's possible its mid-range configurations could come in at less expensive or around the same price as the Mac Mini's.\n\nPersonally, I was seriously considering downsizing to a Mac Mini for my next computer, but with the Lenovo Yoga Mini i, maybe I'll stick to Windows for at least a little bit longer. If you're in the same boat, Lenovo expects to release the Yoga Mini i sometime this June.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Nvidia's Updated DLSS Makes Games Run Worse on Older GPUs",
    "description": "The most commonly uses Nvidia graphics cards are starting to get left in the dust.",
    "fullText": "Unless you run an AI data center, Nvidia's announcements this CES have been more on the quiet end. There were updates to GeForce Now cloud streaming and its DLSS upscaling tech, but no new graphic cards. That's fine—it's normal for Nvidia to have a quiet year on consumer tech every now and then, and the RTX 50-series GPUs just came out last year. Unfortunately, it turns out those DLSS updates are actually making games run worse on older GPUs.\n\nThe new version of DLSS, called DLSS 4.5, is pretty great when it works. It already makes lighting appear far more realistic even when ray tracing or HDR isn't being used, and in the spring, it will introduce dynamic frame generation, which can adjust how many AI frames are inserted into your game on the fly, so that it doesn't waste compute producing more frames than necessary, or than your monitor can produce. I saw examples of both of these use cases in person at CES, and as someone who mostly plays without upscaling when I can, I was impressed enough that I might want to get a new GPU and make the swap.\n\nAnd I stress that \"new GPU\" part. Unfortunately, DLSS 4.5 only seems to work best on Nvidia's newest cards. It released in beta for all Nvidia GeForce RTX cards yesterday, but gamers on older RTX 3000-series cards are already reporting issues. According to a report from X user Mostly Positive Reviews (via Tom's Hardware), users on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU could see up to a 24% dip in performance in Cyberpunk 2077, and a 14% drop in The Last of Us Part 2. Those are just a few examples, but others in the comments posted their own headaches, as did users on Reddit.\n\nThat's not a small issue. The RTX 3080 Ti might be a few generations behind, but it was near the top of the line when it was current. More importantly, according to Steam's own data, the RTX 3060 is currently the most common graphics card on Steam, and it's weaker than the RTX 3080 Ti. And technically, DLSS 4.5 is available for the even weaker RTX 2000-series, which are bound to run into even more severe problems.\n\nSo where's this massive performance loss coming from, and what can you do about it? Likely, it has to do with the new AI transformer model powering DLSS, which Nvidia said was built with RTX 40-series and RTX 50-series cards in mind. While you can use DLSS 4.5 with an older GPU, it doesn't seem like it's intended.\n\nThankfully, if you decided to try out DLSS 4.5 on an older card and you don't like what you're seeing, you're not stuck with it. Currently, public DLSS 4.5 implementation is in beta, and needs to be applied to games by choosing either the \"Model M\" or \"Model L\" preset in the Nvidia app (under \"Latest\" and \"Custom,\" respectively). Choosing another model, like Model K, should get you back to normal. When DLSS 4.5 gets a full release on January 13, I assume this will get even simpler.\n\nStill, it's not a great look that most Nvidia gamers can't use its exciting new feature. Because it can be reversed, it doesn't break anything, but it also shows that Nvidia is starting to leave all but its most loyal GPU customers behind. And as someone who mostly only uses upscaling while on weaker hardware like the Steam Deck, what I find especially weird is that upscaling is already all about using software to improve performance when you're lacking raw power. That should theoretically make gamers with weaker cards the target audience.\n\nBut it's not all doom-and-gloom for my fellow cheap gamers. Alongside DLSS 4.5, Nvidia also announced a native Linux client for Nvidia GeForce Now, alongside a native Amazon Fire TV app. That extends the cloud gaming platform to even more users, and because GeForce Now has a free tier, it's a pretty sweet deal. Play it right, say by getting a Fire TV on sale and loading up a free game, and you could game using Nvidia's latest GPUs on the big screen while spending less than $20. Sure, you might have to deal with some latency and video compression while doing it—as is the tradeoff with cloud gaming—but as DLSS 4.5 shows, even using local hardware comes with its own problems.",

    "title": "CES 2026: This Lenovo Gaming Laptop Can Stretch From 16:9 to ‘Ultrawide’ With the Push of a Button",
    "description": "It's the best of both worlds.",
    "fullText": "Choosing a gaming monitor is a tough choice. Do you want a standard, 16:9 monitor that takes up a small amount of desk space, or a larger 21:9 or even 32:9 ultrawide monitor that takes up more space, but will also show you more of your game? This goes double for laptops, where ultrawide models are few-and-far between, and are absolutely gigantic. Lenovo's new concept for CES, the Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable, aims to give you the best of both worlds.\n\nWhen the laptop is closed, or when you first open it up, the Legion Pro Rollable looks like any other gaming laptop. It's a little thick, with RGB keys and a full numpad, but otherwise isn't notable. It's also got a bog standard, 16:9 aspect ratio. But with the press of a button, it can extend to a 21:9 ultrawide screen. And while it's not quite as fancy as the 32:9 screens the most spoiled gamers use, you can actually extend it further to a 24:9 screen if you want.\n\nThat trick is possible thanks to a rollable OLED panel, something Lenovo's shown off and even released before, but for laptops that extend vertically, and aren't meant for gamers. The transformation is quick and quiet, and Windows doesn't even need time to adjust to match your new aspect ratio. It kind of feels like you're unfurling a scroll.\n\nIn total, the screen space can extend from 16-inches in 16:9 (or \"Focus\") mode to 21-inches in 21:9 (or \"Tactical\") mode to 24-inches in 24:9 (or \"Arena\" mode). Aspect ratio numbers don't always match screen space measurements that neatly, but hey, they're easy to keep track of here.\n\nHaving up to 24 inches of screen space on-the-go could be a life changer, and not just for gamers. Currently, I'm writing this article while traveling, which means I'm stuck with just my laptop screen. I'm sorely missing the second monitor I have at home, and being able to swap my screen into an ultrawide mode could easily fix that issue. Plus, I could just shrink it back down to a more standard form factor when it comes time to pack it away.\n\nThe only real catches would be weight and price. I don't have specific numbers for how heavy this is, but it didn't feel too different from any other gaming laptop in my hands. Beefy, but not back-breaking.\n\nAs for price, here's the kicker. Because this is just a concept, there's no pricing or availability info, since it's not guaranteed to come out. Lenovo does say the unit I saw is based on a top-specced Lenovo Legion Pro 7i, though, which currently goes for around $3,000.\n\nThat would be a lot to pay, especially because the extending screen would probably add a couple hundred dollars to the price tag. I wouldn't put too much stock into the demo unit right now, though—if this does make it to market, you'll probably be able to configure it to better match your needs.\n\nPersonally, though, I might be willing to pay that $3,000. Not only is this truly unique in the space, but it also conveniently solves one of my biggest pain points when I have to use my laptop, which is the lack of a two-screen setup. It could even be useful for desktop gamers looking to make the transition to portable gaming—no more having to choose which type of monitor you want.",

One product in particular caught my eye because it’s focused on a single important function—preventing kitchen fires caused by a person wandering away from the stove.\n\niGuardStove is essentially a smart shutoff for a stove or cooktop. Its new, radar-equipped version costs $399 and can work on gas or electric stoves. (For gas, you’ll need to have a plumber install a shutoff valve.) If you leave the kitchen while cooking, a five-minute timer starts. If you don’t return by the time it goes off, the device either cuts the power to your electric stove, or shuts off the supply line to your gas stove. It can also notify a caregiver that a shutoff event occurred.\n\nA big theme in smart tech this year is aging-in-place. Most older adults would prefer to live at home as long as they can, but health challenges can make that difficult. When it comes to cooking or other activities that require a sharp mind, mental health issues like dementia come into play, as do medications that can have cognitive side effects. With all that in mind, caregivers often worry about a parent leaving the kitchen while cooking, forgetting that the stove is on.\n\nThe National Fire Protection Association reports that cooking fires are the top cause of home fires, the top cause of fire-related injuries, and the number three cause of fire-related deaths. Unattended cooking equipment causes half of those deaths. Older adults are overrepresented as fire casualties compared to younger and middle-aged people.\n\nThe device has a five-minute timer, specifically, because that was a safety margin the company developed with safety organization UL, chief marketing officer Jon Landers told me. You can also override the five-minute timer if you’re roasting a turkey or preparing a slow-simmered sauce. In this case you tell the device how long the food is expected to cook, and it lets this cook time complete before resetting to the usual five-minute timer behavior.\n\nA previous version of the iGuardStove used motion detectors, but if you’ve ever worked in an office that had lights on motion sensors, you know why that wasn’t a great solution: sit still at a table for too long, and the lights go off. The older version of the device could potentially shut off while you're just waiting for your dinner to cook, and could be triggered by motion from pets. Radar solves those problems, since it can more accurately identify when a person is in the room.\n\nI’ve been seeing radar in a number of aging-in-place products at CES this year. The Silver Shield from PontoSense uses radar to monitor a person’s presence and movement in a room, reporting movement and potential falls to a caregiver’s app. Luna, a conversation and reminder device from Cairns Health, includes radar that can monitor heart rate and breathing (even through blankets!) when positioned near a person’s bed. The iGuardStove has some monitoring features in common with those devices, but it stays focused on its main task of ensuring stoves aren’t left running unattended.\n\nRadar can “see” a lot, but it doesn’t feel quite as privacy-invading as a camera. Having a device in the kitchen is also a bit less intrusive than in a bedroom, for those who would feel creeped out knowing that a tech device is watching them sleep.\n\nBesides shutting off the stove, the iGuardStove can report to a caregiver (via an app, of course) things like what time each day a person first enters the kitchen. It can catch nighttime wandering if the person visits the kitchen at night; it can also send an alert if the person doesn’t seem to be up and active at their usual time. For example, if your mom usually makes coffee around 9:00 every morning, you can ask the app to notify you if the kitchen is still empty at 10:00.\n\nBesides shutting off the stove and reporting on the presence of a person in the kitchen, the iGuardStove has a few other clever features. The version of the device made for gas stoves can detect unburned gas, in case somebody left it on without a burner running.\n\nThe device can also be configured to keep the stove from being turned on by pets or children, or it can be locked to not allow cooking during certain hours or days (say, at night). The app can also alert a caregiver if temperatures get too hot or cold, prompting them to check in if a heat wave or a cold snap is bad enough to affect indoor temperatures.\n\nWhile a lot of products I’ve seen at CES are speculative or hopeful in their use cases—I often find myself asking “who would actually use this?”—the iGuardStove seems thoughtfully designed and has a concrete use case and benefit. I was impressed! The new device is expected to ship later this year.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Lenovo's New 'AI Frame' Gaming Monitor Might Actually Just Be Cheating",
    "description": "Is it OK to use AI to zoom in on your reticle in a shooter?",
    "fullText": "It's easy to take this for granted, but not everyone is able to immediately look at a shooting or strategy game and find the reticle or map. Gaming UIs can get complicated, and for less-seasoned gamers, they can be pretty intimidating, too. Lenovo's new concept \"AI Frame\" monitor, shown off at CES 2026, aims to make some games a bit more approachable, although experts might consider it cheating.\n\nHardware-wise, this is a normal 21:9 ultrawide gaming monitor, but it's not actually meant to be used like that. Instead, you play your game in a left-justified 16:9 rectangle that takes up most of the screen, and in the remaining space, the AI will automatically zoom in on part of your gameplay and show a blown-up version of it. For instance, it might show you a zoomed-in map in a MOBA, so you don't have to look at the tiny mini-map in your main gameplay to know where you or your team are. Or, it might zoom in on your reticle in a shooter, letting you better see your targets. There's even enough space left over for you to pull up an internet browser and look up some help.\n\nIt worked pretty well for me in-person. Again, it doesn't actually generate any visuals, but instead just blows up the most important parts of your game screen so you can more easily glance at them or see them in more detail. That does mean resolution can suffer a little, but that's what your main gameplay screen is for. For getting across information, it's a good option.\n\nPlus, while some games will automatically know what to zoom in on, there's also a generic zoom mode that will just blow up whatever your mouse is hovering over, so it can work with any content. The AI Frame is being pitched for games, but you could also use it like a digital magnifying glass on an article in your browser, for instance.\n\nThe catch? It's maybe not exactly \"fair\" to play this way. While a bigger map in a MOBA might just save you some eyestrain, an AI-assisted zoom on a shooting reticle basically lets anyone act like a sniper, regardless of what character you're playing or gun you have equipped. For me, characters in the distance that were basically ants became immediately visible on the AI Frame, which made gunfights much easier to handle.\n\nI suppose we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. The AI Frame is just a proof-of-concept for now, so there's no hard specs sheet or pricing or release date as of yet. But if this does ever actually make it to market, Lenovo might have to contend with companies like Valve. The developer has banned similar \"this is arguably cheating\" peripherals from its games before, and the AI Frame could be the next battlefront in an ongoing war between peripheral makers (who want to sell you on the idea that buying their products can make you a better player) and developers (who, at least theoretically, want all of their players to be on an even playing field).",

    "fullText": "on January 6, 2026 at 9:24PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nIn early 2021, an unknown game called Valheim burst onto the survival games scene after exploding in player count on Steam. For many players, there's still not a game like Valheim that truly captures what it has to offer. From the architecturally sound base building to the Viking atmosphere and the different map environments teeming with new resources and bosses, there's a reason why Valheim is still considered one of the best survival games in the genre.\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean there aren't other games that share many similarities with Valheim. You can play a variety of survival titles that offer a comparable experience in at least one way. If you've been searching for a new game of Valheim's caliber, then we have you covered. We have compiled a list of the 11 best games like Valheim, which are all easily playable in 2026 and share one or more gameplay aspects with the Viking survival game.\n\nThe RuneScape franchise is most well-known in the MMO genre, as the default RuneScape and its counterpart, Old School RuneScape, are both some of the most successful MMOs on the market. However, developer Jagex took a long-awaited step outside that genre with its newest release, RuneScape: Dragonwilds. This is a survival game that has clearly taken some inspiration from Valheim, just like Valheim initially took inspiration from the RuneScape MMO. Dragonwilds features a similar aesthetic, the same kind of precise base building, and several unique skills you can level up by performing actions in the world. Dragonwilds is still unfinished, but the developer is delivering frequent updates to expand the skilling system, add to the story, and design new parts of the map. It's arguably the closest 1:1 experience of Valheim to be found.\n\nSons of the Forest is what you get when you add horror and a more brutal survival experience to Valheim. In terms of gameplay, Sons of the Forest and Valheim are fairly different; Sons of the Forest is a first-person shooter that emphasizes survivability and a more open-ended exploration path. The game begins with you crash-landing on an island filled with dangerous and mysterious creatures that all want you dead. You'll have to scavenge in deep and dark caves and other areas to find tools and weapons you need to survive on the island. A couple of companions can help you out, especially when building your base, but you're mostly on your own as you traverse the island looking for new resources. Sons of the Forest isn't for the faint of heart, as there are intense moments, jump scares, and other horror elements around every corner. However, it's another terrific survival game that shares Valheim's hard-to-master combat and multi-environment map.\n\nIf there's one thing you're taught early on in Valheim, it's to not go into the sea unless you're prepared to face what lies beneath. Well, in Raft, you don't have a choice but to head into the sea. Raft is a survival game that starts you off floating on a small wooden platform surrounded by nothing but water. Through finding resources underwater and eventually finding land formations, you can transform your raft into a luxurious boat that can stand against any threat the game has to offer. However, this doesn't mean danger isn't lurking, as you have to fend for yourself when you dive underwater to look for more supplies. If the resource-gathering and base-building elements of Valheim are what you enjoy most, then you'll find immediate satisfaction with Raft.\n\nWe're headed back to the water with this entry, and Subnautica redefines a fear of the open ocean. If you weirdly enjoyed the sea monster and its appearances in Valheim, then you'll be thrilled with what Subnautica has to offer. You're the lone survivor of a spaceship crash that winds up in the middle of an unknown planet, which is almost entirely made up of water. Your job is to explore the ocean, find other missing members of your crew, and unravel the true nature of the planet's origin and power. Subnautica features some of the best open-world exploration of any game, and its survival elements will test you for your entire playthrough. You'll have to fend off sea creatures of all shapes and sizes, and this includes some truly terrifying leviathan-sized monsters that can eat you in a second if you're not prepared. Subnautica offers a similar style of character and map progression as Valheim, as you need to explore different environments to access new resources that are required to progress to further areas. You'll also partake in fantastic base building that offers the ability to craft underwater submarines.\n\nIf you ever looked at the Valheim map and thought to yourself, \"I could create something better,\" then The Planet Crafter might just be the next game for you. This survival game allows you to completely terraform an entire planet, giving you full control over what kind of fauna, flora, and environments are found in your new home. You'll initially scavenge the planet for supplies so you can get a base set up, but then you can explore and make the planet hospitable for human life. The terraforming process includes maintaining heat, oxygen, and pressure levels, as well as deciding the terrain of a given area. The Planet Crafter doesn't offer the combat or in-depth base building of Valheim, but it does offer the same level of exploration and resource-gathering.\n\nEnshrouded is another survival game that shares plenty of aspects with Valheim. It features deep exploration and has a focus on combat, with the map holding several bosses you can fight to earn unique rewards that will aid you in advancing through other parts of the map. Enshrouded also has a substantial base-building system that allows you to make massive forts in multiple locations across the world. One thing that sets Enshrouded apart from Valheim is its RPG mechanics that offer new upgrades and abilities for your character as you level up. Enshrouded is a great survival experience that can be played solo or in co-op with up to 16 players on a single world.\n\nThe unique parts of Valheim are what make it such a fun survival game, and V Rising offers plenty of new gameplay elements that aren't seen elsewhere. For starters, the game sees you play as a vampire who's just awoken from a long hibernation period. You have to rebuild your kingdom, but to do so you need to brave the outside elements, which aren't kind to vampires. At all times, you need to avoid the sun and other light, or you'll take severe damage. This adds an entirely new layer to the general gameplay loop you see in most survival games. V Rising also has in-depth combat with varied enemies, bosses, and even some PvP if you choose to play on a multiplayer server.\n\nThe original Grounded had various Valheim influences that shone throughout its life cycle, and now the sequel is building off those influences. Grounded 2 is a step-up from the original in just about every way, featuring a more explorable map, new enemy types, and a smoother crafting system. The basic gameplay loop in Grounded 2 is very similar to its prequel, as you still play as a character that's been shrunken down to 1/4th the size of a blade of grass. As this character, you need to survive in a park that's full of different areas and environments, all of which offer resources and items that you can use to build a base and upgrade your character's gear and abilities. The exploration and differently-scaled areas of the map in Grounded 2 are very reminiscent of Valheim, and there's plenty more for fans to enjoy in this fantastic addition to the survival genre.\n\nWhen it comes to difficulty, Valheim certainly doesn't hold your hand through some of the challenging combat engagements or survival aspects. If you're looking for an increased level of difficulty compared to Valheim, though, check out Green Hell. Green Hell is a far tougher survival game that places you right in the middle of the unforgiving Amazon rainforest. You'll have to always monitor your character's vitals and watch out for the different environments that all pose a new kind of threat. In addition to the challenging environments, you'll also face off against difficult enemies who inhabit the rainforest, and they're always lurking nearby. Green Hell features some expansive base building, terrific yet arduous exploration, and a difficulty level that's not often found in a survival game.\n\nPalworld is a survival game that combines elements from Valheim and Pokémon. The game allows you to catch creatures known as Pals that all have different types, levels, locations, and attacks. With your Pals, you can either keep them in a storage system, place them in your party, or put them to work at your base. Pals are especially helpful with base building and management, as some of them have unique abilities that can be utilized to upkeep stations, harvest materials, and build new structures. If you decide to take some Pals with you in your party, you can use them to battle other Pals, including a selection of bosses. Your character can also battle Pals using weapons that are crafted with resources you find in the world. The more you progress, the higher-level resources you can access, which gives you the ability to craft better weapons, gear, and tools. It's all a seamless experience that focuses on the grind of exploring the map to find new Pals and resources. Like in Valheim, Palworld also features fairly strict survival elements, as you have to constantly manage health, hunger, and thirst.\n\nConan Exiles is one of the OG survival games that laid a foundation for many popular games in the genre that followed it. It's set in the Conan the Barbarian universe, and offers a lot of what Valheim fans have come to know and love in the Viking survival game. Conan Exiles offers an in-depth base-building system that allows players to construct a variety of unique and expansive structures. While the combat is fairly limited at the start, Conan Exiles has added sorcery and other combat mechanics over the years, allowing you to utilize plenty of different weapons to take down the enemies that are scattered across the large, open world map. One aspect of Conan Exiles that differs from Valheim is that it offers more multiplayer elements, as there's online PvP and online co-op, both of which add more replayability.",

    "description": "Plenty of games have come out in the years since Unknown Worlds Entertainment released Subnautica that aim to offer a similar experience to the survival title.

    "fullText": "on January 6, 2026 at 9:27PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nPlenty of games have come out in the years since Unknown Worlds Entertainment released Subnautica that aim to offer a similar experience to the survival title. However, only a handful of games are truly like Subnautica enough where you get some of the same feelings while playing them as you did while roaming the open ocean of Planet 4546B for the first time. While few games can totally replicate the complete experience of Subnautica, some are great alternatives that expand upon the gameplay elements or mechanics present in the underwater adventure.\n\nToday, we'll be listing 16 games to play if you're a fan of Subnautica and looking for something else to scratch that survival/horror itch. Of course, there are other elements to Subnautica, including a robust crafting system, vast exploration, and a unique setting, and some of the entries on the list will prominently feature those aspects instead of simply being another survival game with horror elements.\n\nNaturally, we have to kick off this list with the successor to the original Subnautica. Subnautica: Below Zero is a direct sequel to the first game and takes place on the same planet, but in a completely different area. You also play as a new protagonist, a scientist who has come to the planet along with dozens of others to study its fascinating flora and fauna. Below Zero offers more of a story than the original, but your overall goal is still to explore every inch of the ocean and surface. While you'll see some familiar creatures, plants, and craftable structures, Below Zero offers new leviathans and other deadly creatures as well as brand new objects to craft at your base.\n\nOne of the biggest changes in Below Zero is more of an emphasis on land travel, and there's even a new vehicle you can craft to traverse the icy landscapes that are above the ocean. If you loved the original Subnautica, you'll love Below Zero, but we must warn you, the horror elements have been cranked up slightly in the sequel.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nThe Planet Crafter doesn't feature too many water elements like Subnautica, and it doesn't have many formidable creatures to avoid. However, it does allow you to completely terraform an entire planet from the ground up, giving you the chance to dictate every part of how the planet is designed. At the start of the game, your goal is to simply survive the harsh conditions of the planet and build a small base to start the terraforming process. Over time, though, you can begin to tone down the weather conditions and form the planet in whatever image you want. You're able to go through different stages of terraforming, which include creating sustainable resources, to even terraforming insects, plants, and animals. The world is your oyster in The Planet Crafter, and while there are survival elements present, your main job is to transform your planet into a livable environment. It's great for any Subnautica player who enjoyed the base building or perhaps wanted to change certain parts about how the ocean is laid out.\n\nWe've talked about games that take place in the water and on the surfaces of a planet, so how about we combine those settings? No Man's Sky is a game that allows you to explore an entire universe. It gives you a spaceship, some tools to gather resources, and then tells you to head out and explore a nearly infinite, procedurally-generated universe. The universe has more planets than you could ever hope to explore, and though the planets aren't all that different from one another, it's what you can accomplish on the planets that matters.\n\nRecent updates in No Man's Sky give you the chance to create an entire space station on a planet, head underwater into the depths of oceans, and even mine for prehistoric fossils that you can use to further expand your journey. When you're not spending time on a planet, you can meet other players in a central hub and customize your spaceship. It's a fantastic experience that truly never ends if you don't want it to.\n\nRaft is a natural choice for players who are hoping to find a similar experience to Subnautica. Raft is another survival game where you, or you and some friends, are stuck on a small raft in the middle of a vast ocean. Your goal is to survive and expand your raft so you can avoid the perils of the ocean and everything that calls it home, including great white sharks. Over time, you'll eventually scavenge resources to be able to build a large, wooden houseboat that houses different crafting stations to aid your survival. Eventually, you'll even be able to reach different land masses and explore those as well.\n\nWhile Raft places more of an emphasis on staying out of the water than exploring it, you still need to head underwater to secure the resources you need to build more structures on your raft. Sharks and other creatures are lurking nearby, but you're used to that feeling if you've played any Subnautica.\n\nGrounded 2 is the sequel to the hit survival game of the same name, both of which are developed by Obsidian Entertainment, the studio behind The Outer Worlds and Fallout: New Vegas. The sequel to Grounded takes much of the same gameplay design from the original, as you still play as characters that have been shrunken down to the size of a grain of sand. However, Grounded 2 features an entirely new map, fresh content to unlock, and a much more rewarding gameplay loop. You'll fight bosses, explore for new research that can be turned into gear, and build a staggering base to keep out all of those pesky insects.\n\nWe don't have to spend a lot of time on this entry. Minecraft is the game that paved the way for most modern survival games, crafting a blueprint for the genre that has been followed and altered since 2009. While there aren't too many horror elements of Minecraft that might attract leviathan-loving Subnautica fans, everything else is a survival player's dream. You have a randomly generated map that goes on far beyond what you're able to explore, hundreds of crafting resources, and the ability to build whatever kind of base your mind can dream up. If you want a different kind of Minecraft experience, you can also access thousands of mods or custom servers that completely change the gameplay.\n\nAstroneer is another survival game that allows you to terraform planets, but on a much larger scale. Instead of getting a single planet to manage, you can bounce between five different planets, changing each one the way you see fit. Each planet houses various resources for you to gather that unlock new crafting recipes that you can use to upgrade your base or increase the production of other resources. In addition to base building and terraforming, Astroneer also offers expansive exploration, with planets housing several different environments and secret locations to discover.\n\nPerhaps the most noticeable aspect of Astroneer, though, is its graphics; the visuals are extremely vibrant and feature a distinct art style that looks like everything on your screen was hand-painted. Astroneer is an experience similar to Subnautica in some ways, but it offers much \n\nStranded Deep offers an extremely similar premise to Subnautica. It starts off with you being the survivor of a plane crash and stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. You need to find a way to survive the ocean's elements and creatures before eventually finding land, which comes with its own challenges. Luckily, Stranded Deep offers a skills system that allows you to upgrade your character in various ways as you progress. This gives you the chance to unlock fresh crafting recipes to use on your base or even different vehicles that allow you to explore more areas of the map, which is procedurally generated.\n\nIn addition to the basic survival and base-building gameplay loops, Stranded Deep also offers a robust combat system. You can eventually challenge three different bosses to earn uber-important rewards. There are also a slew of other creatures you can hunt for food or sport. Stranded Deep offers perhaps the closest experience to Subnautica on this list, but it does offer \n\nForever Skies is a recent game that takes clear inspiration from the Subnautica series, but does add several of its own twists. The game is set on a post-apocalyptic Earth that has been ravaged ecologically, leaving you with very little in terms of resources to gather. Fortunately, you're able to construct a massive airship that can travel across the map so you can find new areas to explore. Your airship acts as your main base, and you can place different crafting stations and structures on board that help you survive. When you're not flying high above the clouds, you can also head underneath the various bodies of water on the map, which house important resources, but massive leviathans as well. There are also large enemies on land as well, but Forever Skies equips you with some weapons to fight off these foes. It's an interesting spin on the Subnautica style of survival games, and it's worth checking out for the airship aspect alone.\n\nIf you particularly enjoy the horror elements of Subnautica, then Sons of the Forest might be the perfect game to follow it up. However, Sons of the Forest cranks the survival and horror aspects to another level. The game begins with you and a companion named Kelvin crash-landing on a seemingly deserted island. You, along with your now deaf companion Kelvin, need to find a way to stay alive and figure out exactly where you are. As you explore the island in Sons of the Forest, you'll quickly learn you're not alone. There are monsters everywhere you turn, and the only way to survive is by venturing into dark caverns and other locations to find the tools and gear you need.\n\nJump-scares are a common sight in Sons of the Forest, but when you're not exploring the dangerous caverns of the island, you can construct a decent-sized base and craft a number of other objects. This includes weapons and even vehicles, making exploration much easier and safer. Sons of the Forest is able to match the sheer terror of Subnautica while also maintaining the same sense of exploration and harsh survival scenarios.\n\nOuter Wilds has perhaps the most compelling premise and gameplay loop out of any game on this list. It's another space exploration survival game, but instead of maintaining a persistent base and inventory of resources, you have a completely different goal than to simply survive. Instead, Outer Wilds forces you to explore several unique planets, all of which house secrets and dangerous environments. The game's twist is that you're caught in a time loop, which only gives you a set amount of time to explore before you're sent back to your original starting point. When you start over, you have to go out and explore everything again. However, every time you venture out on a new journey, you're armed with the knowledge you gained from the previous explorations. It's a totally different experience from Subnautica, but one that still matches the same sense of wonder you get from exploring Planet 4546B's ocean.\n\nValheim is widely regarded as one of the best modern survival games. Like Subnautica, Valheim has inspired a number of recent survival titles. While Valheim and Subnautica mainly share a survival aspect, both games offer extremely difficult elements that need to be constantly managed in order to stay alive. In Valheim, you play as a banished Viking who needs to prove their worth to escape banishment. Your primary task is to defeat five bosses, who are located in five different zones across the map. In order to progress to each boss, you need to fully explore every subsequent zone, unlocking the specific crafting resources each one offers. With those crafting resources, you have to make tools and weapons to defeat the zone's boss.\n\nValheim offers a randomly-generated map, architecturally-sound base building, and excellent combat that makes you think about every move you make. You can also cross oceans and encounter some large enemies along the way if you're really craving some Subnautica-like gameplay.\n\nGreen Hell is a survival game that was likely inspired by the original The Forest. However, there are Subnautica elements present that will appeal to fans. Green Hell is set in the Amazon rainforest and tasks you with simply surviving the harsh elements of South America. The game features some of the most difficult survival elements in any game on this list, as you have to contend with constant weather conditions, lethal inhabitants, and various animals that all want you dead. Fortunately, Green Hell offers expansive base-building and crafting systems, giving you the ability to construct a fortress in the jungle complete with defenses and stations to make new objects.\n\nWhile Green Hell takes place on land, its map is just as dangerous as Subnautica's ocean. You have to carefully wade into every new zone in the Amazon, or else you risk dying to a new threat.\n\nArk: Survival Evolved is one of the longer-running survival games, and it has built up quite a massive player base since its release in 2015. Ark takes place on land and in the water, where you have to contend with prehistoric dinosaurs at every turn. Most of the dinos you encounter can be tamed, but you'll be running from them or fighting them the majority of the time. When you're not taming or fighting a prehistoric creature, you spend your time exploring a huge map that houses dozens of points of interest and places to build a base. You need to scavenge for resources to unlock an arsenal of weapons that can be used to fight against dinosaurs or other players if you join a PvP server.\n\nThe bases that are possible to build in Ark, along with the amount of flora and fauna you can encounter, are truly staggering. It's one of the largest-scale survival games on the market, and can easily match the thrills of Subnautica, especially if you're a fan of the leviathans.\n\nThe Long Dark is another decade-old survival game that features some of the most realistic survival elements out of any game in the genre. It's a truly solo experience that places a massive emphasis on strategizing exactly how to survive in the Canadian wilderness. You won't encounter too many enemies to fight or people to talk to; all you have is your mind and abilities. The Long Dark forces you to carefully manage hunger, thirst, stamina, and warmth while trying to scavenge for the resources to keep yourself healthy. You're able to stumble across tools and gear that make survival easier, but you'll never truly be safe from Mother Nature.\n\nYou won't take part in any base building in The Long Dark, but you will find a true sense of exploration and the terror of failing to survive. The Long Dark features permadeath in the survival mode, meaning if you die, you're dead for good.\n\nYou can think of Breathedge as like Subnautica, but in space. Breathedge places you, a character simply known as \"The Man,\" in the center of a galaxy after your spaceship breaks down while on the way to a funeral. Don't fret, though, as you have an immortal chicken by your side and plenty of items to scavenge from the various space stations in your vicinity. You'll be able to find and drive vehicles, craft new gear, and uncover some hidden truths about the galaxy around you. While Breathedge doesn't feature the heart-pounding exploration that Subnautica does, it's still a game that's begging to be explored and offers hours of seamless gameplay.",

    "fullText": "Booed off the pitch after conceding a late winner at home against their relegation rivals and on a 10-game winless run - these are desperate times for West Ham.\n\nThe Hammers have been in the Premier League in every campaign since 2012-13, but that stretch is under threat.\n\nOn Tuesday, they let a 1-0 lead slip before losing 2-1 to fellow strugglers Nottingham Forest - a result that leaves the Hammers seven points adrift of safety with 17 games to go.\n\n\"We will look to the mirror and know the position we are in, and nobody from the squad wants to play second division next season,\" said West Ham midfielder Tomas Soucek.\n\n\"We have to show the honesty between each other. The truth of who cares and who not.\"\n\nWest Ham, who won a European trophy as recently as 2023, have had a wretched campaign, but their fans would have been hoping for some late presents with an attractive post-Christmas fixture list.\n\nHome games against Fulham, Brighton and Nottingham Forest and a trip to bottom-of-the-table Wolves were a chance for the Hammers to get themselves out of trouble.\n\nOf those 12 points available, West Ham picked up just one - and even that came after they had twice thrown away the lead before drawing 2-2 with Brighton.\n\nThey conceded a late winner against Fulham, were humiliated 3-0 by Wolves and then again managed to lose after scoring first against Forest, with Morgan Gibbs-White converting a decisive 89th-minute penalty.\n\nAt half-time, the Hammers were one point from safety - now they are cut adrift and left facing a huge battle to stay up.\n\nWith four draws and six losses, it is the first time West Ham have gone 10 Premier League games without a win since a run of 11 between December 2006 and March 2007.\n\nOnly Bournemouth with 16 have dropped more top-flight points from winning positions than the Hammers' 15, while West Ham have also failed to win any of their past five matches when scoring first.\n\nBoss Nuno Espirito Santo, who guided Nottingham Forest to Europe last season before being dismissed three games into 2025-26, has now picked up 11 points from 16 matches since he replaced the sacked Graham Potter in September.\n\nThat is the worst start from any West Ham boss in the Premier League era, with the back-to-back wins over Newcastle and Burnley in November - Nuno's only two successes - quickly fading from memory.\n\nFormer West Ham and England goalkeeper Rob Green, speaking on Sky Sports, feels change is needed at London Stadium.\n\n\"Ten games without a win you're wondering, where is the answer now? Where do West Ham go now? Where does Nuno go from here? You can't see things continuing much longer with results like this,\" said Green.\n\n\"They need at least 30 points to have any chance of staying up and they're not going to get close at this rate.\n\n\"I don't see Nuno staying. I just can't see it how you can go this long without winning a game. Tonight wasn't the worst performance by a long shot and they still didn't get a result.\n\n\"It's heartbreaking but I don't see another answer. It's looking more and more an impossible task.\"\n\nWest Ham, with just 14 points all season, have London derbies at Tottenham and Chelsea either side of a tough game at home against Sunderland coming up.\n\nNuno, who handed a debut to Argentina striker Valentin 'Taty' Castellanos and brought on another January signing in Brazilian forward Pablo Felipe, remained defiant.\n\n\"It's not over yet. We keep on going,\" he said. \"We need to keep believing and sticking together.\n\n\"We have to keep going, keep believing and keep working. It is not over. Sometimes you have good moments and bad moments but you need to be resilient enough to understand this is the game.\n\n\"We understand the fans' frustration and the sadness - we are all the same.\"\n\nSoucek insisted Nuno still had the players' backing and added: \"We have to be behind the manager always, until the end.\n\n\"He can be a big help for us because he did a lot through the Premier League already.\n\n\"Especially for him I want to keep going and do the maximum, we don't want them to lose their jobs. All of us, even for the fans, we need to stick together.\"\n\nNuno Espírito Santo's position as West Ham head coach is heavily under the microscope.\n\nSupporters and pundits have already written off the Portuguese's chances of keeping the club in the Premier League. But the real question to ask is: what do the owners think of the job Nuno is doing?\n\nWell, there is certainly disappointment at the results which have left them rooted in the bottom three.\n\nThere is similar sentiment towards the performance of the team and thus the manager.\n\nBut the club's hierarchy are desperate to make Nuno's appointment a success.\n\nThey are actively backing him in the transfer market. The signings of Pablo Felipe and Taty Castellanos were both players selected by Nuno.\n\nSo to pull the rug from under him, having made signings on the manager's recommendation, would seem nonsensical. But the threat of relegation can radically change the direction of travel.\n\nWest Ham are seven points adrift from safety. That scenario will really test the board's backing of their under-pressure boss.\n\nPremier League: Gibbs-White scores late Forest winner at West Ham\n\nLatest West Ham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about West Ham - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "No. 9 BYU hosts rebuilt Arizona State on Wednesday at the Marriott Center before first matchup with rival Utah on Saturday in Salt Lake City.",
    "fullText": "One of the best things about playing basketball in the Big 12 is that there is no such thing as a trap game, even when a matchup with your fiercest rival is on the horizon.\n\nThat has been BYU coach Kevin Young’s message to his team this week as it prepares for a Wednesday night showdown (7 p.m. MST, Peacock), its Big 12 home opener, at the Marriott Center with reimagined Arizona State (0-1, 9-5), a team that features three explosive scorers and a savvy, experienced and fiery coach, Bobby Hurley.\n\nBYU (1-0, 13-1) finishes the week playing at rival Utah (0-1, 8-6) on Saturday, but Young said there will be no looking ahead. The Sun Devils have too much talent to overlook, and they were one of the better 3-point shooting teams in the country until their last three games, losses at UCLA and at home to Oregon State and Colorado.\n\nUtah (0-1, 8-6) will play at Colorado on Wednesday night before hosting BYU in the Huntsman Center on Saturday night in what will be the first coaching meeting of Young and Alex Jensen, who also came to the college ranks from the NBA.\n\n“To be honest, I haven’t even thought about Utah,” Young said Tuesday afternoon. “We’re extremely locked in on Arizona State and trying to make sure we are dialed in for them. They are a good team, much better than they were last year.”\n\nThe Cougars swept the Sun Devils last year, winning 76-56 in Provo and 91-81 in Tempe.\n\nYoung said Arizona State is “totally different” than it was last year, with sophomore guard Trevor Best the only holdover from a squad that went 4-16 in league play and 13-20 overall. Another familiar face on the ASU roster is 6-foot-8 redshirt sophomore Marcus Adams Jr., who played sparingly for BYU in 2023-24 before Young arrived in Provo. He’s averaging 3.6 points and 2.4 rebounds off the bench.\n\nPacific/Pepperdine transfer Maurice “Moe” Odum leads them in scoring with a 16.6 average, while NAIA University of the Cumberlands transfer Anthony “Pig” Johnson chips in 14.1 points per game and 7-foot-1 freshman Massamba Diop of Senegal averages 13.6 per outing.\n\nArizona State’s best wins were over Texas and Washington State at the Maui Invitational and over Oklahoma and Santa Clara in December.\n\n“They are talented. They did a good job finding good players. I am really impressed with several of their guys,” Young said. “They are obviously super long, starting 6-10, 6-11, 7-1 (players) inside. And then the guard, Moe Odum, he’s as dynamic of a guard as we’ve seen to date.”\n\nDefense and 3-point shooting has abandoned Hurley’s bunch in the three-game skid. They are shooting 19.2% from beyond the arc during that stretch, after shooting 45.3% from deep in the three games before that, against lesser competition.\n\n“We are in a tailspin right now from behind the 3-point line, and we have made a lot of those shots,” Hurley said after the Colorado loss. “… We have to solve our rebounding, and we have to solve our interior defense.”\n\nMeanwhile, BYU enters its first home game since Dec. 22 as one of the hottest teams in the country, and unbeaten in Big 12 play after its 83-73 win at Kansas State last Saturday. The Cougars have won 10-straight games for the first time since the 2010-11 season (when they did that twice) and have won nine-straight Big 12 regular-season games dating back to last year.\n\nStar wing AJ Dybantsa leads the country in scoring (23.1 ppg.) and sophomore guard Rob Wright III, a transfer from Baylor, has been “unbelievable as well,” Young said.\n\n“Rob’s experience in our league is also something that I think I’ve not only relied on, but will rely on even more as we move forward in conference play,” Young said.\n\nThe Cougars last won nine-straight regular-season conference games in 2020, when they were in the West Coast Conference.\n\n“We are fairly happy with where we are at,” said senior wing Richie Saunders after he, Dybantsa and Wright combined to score 52 points against KSU. “There are so many things we are still growing at, still getting better at. I feel good about where we are at, but we still need to grow more. … We want to peak at or near the end of conference play. But I like where we are currently at.”",

    "description": "Jackson's greatness didn't lead to late-game rallies or playoff win streaks. John Harbaugh was judged on that. His successor will be, too.",
    "fullText": "John Harbaugh was a very good and occasionally great NFL head coach. But with Lamar Jackson in tow, he trended squarely toward the former.\n\nAfter missing the playoffs in 2025 and with a 3-5 postseason record with the two-time MVP in tow, the Baltimore Ravens decided they'd seen enough. Harbaugh made it past Black Monday. He didn't last beyond Tuesday; the Ravens fired him two days after Baltimore's season ended with a missed 44-yard field goal in Pittsburgh.\n\n2025 was a perfect storm for the Ravens, who managed to stave off postseason elimination until the very last second of the regular season anyway. The defense fell apart under former rising star coordinator Zach Orr. An undermanned receiving corps was effectively a one-man show. And, most importantly, Lamar Jackson didn't look anything like the best version of himself.\n\nInjuries played a part. Jackson was, per usual, as banged up as you'd expect a running quarterback to be. He missed four starts due to injury and left two other games with hamstring and back injuries. But when he did play, he was a fraction of the quarterback he once was in every facet of the game.\n\nHis passing output dropped from 245 yards per game to 196. His sack rate exploded from 4.6 percent to 10.6. Negative plays compounded while explosive ones dwindled. His expected points added (EPA) per dropback fell from 0.29 in last year's first-team All-Pro campaign (best in the NFL) to -0.04 (22nd, just behind a 42-year-old Aaron Rodgers). His average target distance, deep ball and tight window rates all remained roughly the same but the delivery changed, leading to a significant dropoff. His 72.4 percent on-target throw rate was the lowest of his career.\n\nTJ WATT PICKS OFF LAMAR ON THE DEFLECTED PASS.\n\nBALvsPIT on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/ViXTN12C7G\n\nThat threatened to make him the run-to-paper-over-bad-throws quarterback detractors falsely accused him of being early in his career. Instead, his ground game shrank in lock step with his aerial regression.\n\nJackson went from 8.2 rushing attempts per game in 2024 -- then a career-low -- to 5.2, running less often than nine other NFL quarterbacks including Justin Fields and Jaxson Dart. His success rate, measured by how often a play gains at least 40 percent of yards required on first down, 60 percent of yards required on second down, and 100 percent on third or fourth down, ranked first in the NFL at 64.3 percent in 2022.\n\nIn 2024, it hit 56.1 to rank fifth among all qualified runners and second only to Jayden Daniels among quarterbacks. In 2025, his 5.2 yards per carry came with a career-low 47.8 percent success rate. That's the first time it's dipped below 50 percent and good for 48th place among all players and seventh among QBs.\n\nThere is hope this was all injury related and a rebound is near. But cracks began to show even before injury turned the offense over to Cooper Rush (horrible) and Tyler Huntley (mostly fine). He dazzled through the air in Weeks 1 through 4 and still went 1-3 in those games. He was sacked 15 times in those games, including seven times by the Detroit Lions -- something that's only ever happened once before in 116 regular season starts. He ran the ball fewer than four times per game. While he was efficient through the air, it was in a way that didn't swing games.\n\nThat leads us back to a problem that's persisted throughout his career. Jackson traditionally tends to come up short in close battles. He has 13 career game-winning drives in 115 regular season and postseason starts. He had five such drives in 62 games since 2022. Bo Nix, on the other hand, had seven game-winning drives in 2025 alone. Caleb Williams had six.\n\nBack in Week 1, he couldn't sustain the late drives to keep the Buffalo Bills from coming back from a 40-25 deficit in the final four minutes (obviously Baltimore's deficient defense deserves some blame as well). Early fourth quarter stall-outs kept him from delivering a home win against Detroit in Week 3.\n\nWeek 18 saw him dazzle late to keep the Ravens punching in a sloppy heavyweight de facto playoff game in Pittsburgh.\n\nLAMAR. ZAY. WOW.\n\nRAVENS TAKE THE LEAD.\n\nBALvsPIT on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/RLFrGLddRj\n\nWhile Tyler Loop's missed kick wasn't his fault, the previous loss to the Steelers -- 27-22 after Jackson led four different fourth quarter drives into Steeler territory at home and came away with exactly two field goals and nothing else -- kinda is.\n\nThat was Harbaugh's problem with Jackson. He couldn't turn his quarterback's dazzling heroics into the wins that mattered. Baltimore is 76-31 with its star quarterback at the helm in the regular season. It's 3-5 in the playoffs with a single trip beyond the Divisional Round, zero postseason win streaks and zero Super Bowl appearances to show for it.\n\nJackson's passer rating drops from an NFL-best (ever!) 102.2 in the regular season to 84.6. His sack rate goes from 7.3 to 10.4. Even though he improves a bit as a runner in January, it's not enough to cover his failings.\n\nThe Ravens took all this in. They decided good was, in fact, the enemy of great. They opted to venture into the unknown rather than head back to the playoffs with a sinking feeling of failure enveloping them.\n\nRestoring Jackson isn't the only pressing issue Baltimore's new coach will face. The defensive identity of one of the league's hardest-hitting teams has been cracked and needs to be rebuilt. Derrick Henry is 31 years old and can only keep this up for another one, two decades tops.\n\nBut ultimately, Harbaugh's replacement will be judged on his ability to turn Jackson into something more than a regular season award magnet. Improvement may be easy to come by once the dynamic quarterback is healthy again. It won't mean anything until he starts stringing together comeback wins or rallying Baltimore to multiple playoff victories.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Whomever replaces John Harbaugh as Ravens coach has to fix Lamar Jackson",

    "fullText": "USC has beefed up its defensive line room once again, landing Penn State defensive end transfer Zuriah Fisher out of the NCAA Transfer Portal.\n\nFisher, a fifth-year redshirt senior, appeared in 11 games this season for the Nittany Lions and had his best statistical season yet. The 6-foot-3, 265-pounder totaled 19 tackles, 3.5 TFLs and a pair of sacks while also forcing a fumble.\n\n“I think internally within our program, I think there is a lot of confidence that Fish has got a chance to have a big year,” former head coach James Franklin said of Fisher prior to this season. “He’s like one of those guys that I don’t think anybody’s talking about right now, outside of the program, based on just not seeing him recently, but there’s a lot of excitement internally, with our players, with our staff. I think those things are really apparent.”\n\nThat came after sitting out the 2024 campaign due to injury, giving him a medical redshirt that season. In 2023, Fisher played in all 13 of the team’s games, notching 16 tackles, 3.5 tackles for loss and three sacks. Prior to that, he appeared in 10 games over his first three seasons with PSU.\n\nA member of the Class of 2020, he is expected to have one year of eligibility remaining with the Trojans. As a high schooler, Fisher was a four-star prospect and tabbed as the nation’s No. 320 overall recruit and No. 20 EDGE in his class.\n\nNow, after finishing his sixth year at the college level this fall, he’ll look for a breakout opportunity in Los Angeles. The Trojans are expected to bring back their top three pass rushers in underclassmen Kameryn Crawford, Jide Abasiri and Braylan Shelby.\n\nThe young trio totaled 13.5 sacks last season, and USC also brings in one of the nation’s premier defensive end recruits in five-star Luke Wafle. With so much young talent, a veteran presence like Fisher could elevate the Trojans into one of the best pass-rushing groups in the country next year.",

    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks are looking like victims of their own success. While the players are getting an extra week of rest due to the No. 1 seed, their coaches are busier than ever... even with non-Seahawks related matters. Offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak is already getting plenty of requests from teams around the league to be their head coach, such as the Atlanta Falcons, but he isn't the only Seahawks coach drawing interest.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, NFL insider Ian Rapoport broke the news the Cleveland Browns have officially requested to interview Seahawks defensive coordinator Aden Durde for their open head coach position. Although head coach Mike Macdonald is the one who calls the plays on defense, Seattle's success on that side of the ball can certainly be attributed to help from Durde as well.\n\nThe #Browns have requested permission to interview #Seahawks DC Aden Durde for their vacant HC job, source said.\n\nThe native of England came to the NFL as a #Cowboys coaching intern and has risen quickly.\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 6, 2026\n\nDurde has been the Seahawks' defensive coordinator for the last two seasons. Personally, I had some hope with Macdonald being the one who calls the plays, Durde might've remained a well-kept secret in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nNFL organizations cannot deny a coach from interviewing for a position that is an upgrade, so if Durde is interested in throwing his hat in the ring with the Browns, it will be up to him.\n\nAs for Kubiak, several other teams in the league have joined the Falcons in asking permission to interview him for their vacant head coaching spots. However, according to Albert Breer, Kubiak is still figuring out what to do with the requests.\n\nSeahawks OC Klint Kubiak has gotten requests to interview for the Giants, Cardinals, Raiders and Falcons head coaching jobs, per source. His focus is on the playoffs, so he'll take a day or two and figure out a plan to balance all of it.\n\nSeattle is on a bye as the NFC's 1 seed.\n\n— Albert Breer (@AlbertBreer) January 6, 2026\n\nBoth of Seattle's coordinators getting interview requests is a challenge the Seahawks will have to navigate during the bye week. Teams can often lose focus during this time if they are not careful, which often results in catastrophic losses. Seattle needs to find a way to balance everything, as Breer mentioned in the tweet above, in order to maximize this rare opportunity for a potential Super Bowl run.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Cleveland Browns request to interview Seattle Seahawks DC Aden Durde",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Chicago Bulls made a roster move Tuesday, bringing back fan favorite Yuki Kawamura on a two-way deal.\n\nAfter an impressive run in the 2025 NBA Summer League with Chicago, it seemed certain that Kawamura would compete for minutes deep into the rotation. In five Summer League games, Kawamura averaged 10.2 points, 6.2 assists, 2.4 rebounds and 2.2 steals while showcasing impressive vision in 23.9 minutes per game.\n\nThat said, it never worked out that way, as Chicago's roster was stacked with guards like Josh Giddey, Coby White, Kevin Huerter, Tre Jones and Jevon Carter.\n\nAs a result, the Bulls waived Kawamura prior to the season.\n\nHowever, they've brought him back now, waiving Trentyn Flowers to complete the move.\n\nThis will give Kawamura his first opportunity of the season to earn NBA minutes. Last year with the Memphis Grizzlies, Kawamura only appeared in 22 games, averaging 4.2 minutes per contest. In limited action he averaged 1.6 points and 0.9 assists. In the G-League for Memphis, Kawamura averaged a double-double with 13.7 points and 10.7 assists per game.\n\nAlthough, he could earn an opportunity sooner rather than later as Giddey remains sidelined with a hamstring injury. Additionally, White has been listed as questionable for Chicago's next matchup against Detroit.\n\nKawamura will have his first chance to suit up against the Pistons Wednesday and again Thursday versus the Miami Heat on the second night of a back-to-back.\n\nVJ Edgecombe reaches stats unseen by a rookie since LeBron in 2003\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander praises Chet Holmgren for OKC's success\n\nLeBron James breaks another scoring record in win over Grizzlies\n\nTyrese Maxey: 'Joel Embiid was really the first person to believe in me'\n\nOne of the NBA's most efficient players is on a two-way contract\n\nCam Thomas' most recent dispute with Brooklyn ignites trade rumors\n\nMiami reveals the status of Tyler Herro, Bam Adebyao and more ahead of Saturday's game\n\nGuerschon Yabusele addresses his future with the Knicks following trade rumors",

That remains to be seen, but they are a top contender for Temecula (Calif.) Chaparral four-star Dane Weber.\n\nThe 6-foot signal-caller made multiple trips to Lawrence in 2025. He’s gotten familiar with the KU staff, and on Monday, he was visited by offensive analyst Eric Terrazas:\n\nAppreciate your time and effort @CoachTraz \n\nAmazing home Visit!!! @KU_Football@Kotelnicki @KUCoachZ @CoachLeipold #ROCKCHALK pic.twitter.com/Am9v9krdT6\n\n— Dane Weber (@DaneWeber08) January 5, 2026\n\nWhen speaking with Rivals’ Greg Biggins around New Year’s Day, Weber tabbed Kansas as one of two schools pushing the hardest entering 2026. The Jayhawks have clearly made Weber a priority and he’s feeling the love.\n\nCincinnati, Colorado and Washington have all made their presence felt in Weber’s recruitment to this point, too. There’s other programs that he expects to come and see him throw ahead of the busy spring period, including Oregon and Auburn.\n\n“It will be good to connect with those coaches and see where I’m at on their boards,” Weber told Biggins. “The transfer portal is opening up and I’m interested to see where everyone ends up. By end of January, I want to cut it down and then set up trips. The plan will be to take my visits and then make my decision in late Spring.”\n\nWeber is the No. 357 overall prospect and No. 25 QB in the 2027 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all major recruiting media companies. He’s also the No. 35 recruit in California.\n\nBiggins writes this of Weber, who put together a nice campaign in 2025:\n\n“Weber had a big junior season and is one of the nation’s true dual-threat quarterbacks. He’s a pocket guy who can carve up a defense and threw for 3,645 yards and 41 touchdowns while completing 70% of his throws. He can take off and run at any time and rushed for 688 yards and 14 touchdowns on the ground and is the type of signal caller who can stress a defense with his arm and his legs.”\n\nKU is currently without a commitment in its 2027 class. Last month, it inked 17 prospects, compiling the No. 54 class in the nation, according to the Rivals Industry Team Recruiting Rankings.\n\nHead coach Lance Leipold and Co. did sign a QB as Maize (Kan.) Northwest three-star Jaylen Mason opted to stay home. He’s now Rivals’ No. 49 QB and No. 6 recruit in the Sunflower State.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Chicago Bulls have been dealing with a plethora of injuries since the start of the 2025-2026 campaign. Josh Giddey will be out due to a hamstring injury for two weeks. Zach Collins is out with a sprained right toe, but is expected to return on January 10th. Jalen Smith is out with a concussion, while Matas Buzelis is down with an illness, despite both being listed as day-to-day.\n\nCoby White joined the fray after reinjuring his right calf during his game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on December 29th. He would miss the next three games against the New Orleans Pelicans, Orlando Magic, and Charlotte Hornets. He would return to play against the Boston Celtics, but came off the bench while being placed on a 25-minute restriction.\n\nAlthough he had an off-night, scoring just 5 points while going 2-7 from the field and 1-5 from the three-point line, it’s clear the Bulls are taking precautionary measures to slowly ease White into the rotation. With Josh Giddey out, the team will depend on White to carry out his offensive responsibilities along with veteran Nikola Vucevic. However, it’s only possible if White remains healthy as he finally gets over the stagnant calf injury that sidelined him for most of the season.\n\nMORE:Bulls sign 5-foot-7 fan-favorite guard, cut ties with second-year wing\n\nWith this in mind, White is questionable for his matchup on Wednesday against the Detroit Pistons. This is the first game of a back-to-back before the Bulls would go on to play the Miami Heat on Thursday for the second night. The franchise might limit White to play just one game while resting for the other due to injury management.

    "fullText": "Football is theatre. For someone who has chosen journalism as a career, it's easy to appreciate a good story. One of the most important of Tuesday's news cycle involves a former Philadelphia Eagles assistant. John Harbaugh has been fired. He leaves the Baltimore Ravens after leading them for nearly two decades.\n\nAround these parts, we've been busy talking about the Birds in Philadelphia, but The Flock in Baltimore has been equally fascinating. Their story involves a 30th-anniversary campaign, disappointment, and ultimately a loss in the NFL's final regular-season game. That eliminates them from postseason contention.\n\nHarbaugh has been on the hot seat all season and is now unemployed, but he won't be for long. ESPN's top NFL insider Adam Schefter reports that at least seven teams have inquired about his services. That includes one team that hasn't fired its head coach yet.\n\nWhat does this have to do with the NFC East, you ask? We appreciate the question. Lines are being drawn connecting the dots representing John Harbaugh and the New York Giants. Schefter released his report on that also.\n\nSources: John Harbaugh is expected to emerge as a favorite for the head coaching job of the New York Giants.\n\nHarbaugh will be in demand for many teams, not just the Giants.\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 6, 2026\n\nJohn Harbaugh comes from Andy Reid's coaching tree. He spent ten seasons as the Eagles' special teams coordinator and defensive backs coach. It's sad that his tenure in Baltimore ends partially because of a special teams miscue.\n\nAfter having spent so much time here, it isn't shocking to find an Eagles fan who still loves him. That all goes out of the window however if he lands in Gotham as the leader of the hated Giants.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: John Harbaugh is the favorite for the New York Giants job",

It feels like he's got untapped upside.\n\nAnd with QB-needy teams around the league, someone is going to pay Willis. At this point, it's not even a matter of how much, because a payday is coming.

    "fullText": "Which team suits Jeremiyah Love in this years upcoming NFL draft originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAs the 2026 NFL Draft approaches, one name rising quickly on scouts’ boards is Notre Dame’s dynamic running back, Jeremiyah Love. Considered a top prospect and projected as a potential first-round pick, Love is generating significant buzz due to his rare combination of size, speed, and versatility. Mock drafts frequently link him to teams like the New Orleans Saints, Kansas City Chiefs, and Minnesota Vikings, with other franchises such as the New York Giants, Jets, and Arizona Cardinals also reportedly interested.\n\nStanding out at 6-foot-1 and around 220 pounds, Love combines downhill power running with breakaway speed, making him a threat between the tackles and in the open field. His 2025 season was remarkable; he set Notre Dame’s single-season touchdown record, proving his ability to find the end zone with consistency.\n\nBut Love isn’t just a runner. He’s a polished receiver out of the backfield, frequently lining up as a wide option and showing great hands and route-running ability. This dual-threat skill set is essential in today’s NFL, where running backs must impact the passing game as much as the ground game. Love’s willingness and ability as a pass protector further increase his value, showing he can handle the complexities of NFL blocking schemes.\n\nOne of the teams most commonly associated with Love in mock drafts is the New Orleans Saints. The Saints have a strong quarterback in place and a talented receiving corps, including Chris Olave, but lack a true star running back. Love would bring a new dimension to their offense with his downhill running style and receiving skills. The Saints also need to bolster their offensive line, but Love’s versatility would allow them to maximize their existing weapons.\n\nSimilarly, the Kansas City Chiefs could be an ideal landing spot. Pairing Love with Patrick Mahomes would provide a dynamic, multi-dimensional offensive threat capable of creating mismatches against defenses. The Minnesota Vikings, looking to rejuvenate their backfield, also make sense given Love’s potential to be a long-term solution in their offense.\n\nThe debate about drafting running backs in the first round remains lively. While some analysts are cautious due to the importance of offensive line play, recent first-round backs like Bijan Robinson and Jahmyr Gibbs have proven how impactful the position can be with the right supporting cast. Saquon Barkley, another top-10 running back pick, demonstrated his full potential only after moving to Philadelphia, highlighting how situational fit is crucial.\n\nLove fits the mold of a first-round back who can immediately influence a team’s offensive identity. His combination of power, speed, and receiving ability offers a unique weapon that can change the way defenses prepare.\n\nUltimately, Jeremiyah Love is more than just a running back; he is a multi-faceted offensive weapon ready to make an immediate impact in the NFL. While some teams may hesitate to use a first-round pick on a running back due to positional value debates, Love’s talent and fit with teams in need could see him selected in the top 15 or even top 10.\n\nIf the Saints or Chiefs decide to prioritize offense in the early rounds, Love’s name will be among the first called a player who can bring explosiveness and versatility to an NFL offense hungry for game-changers. His draft stock continues to rise, and many believe he could redefine the value of the running back position in 2026.\n\nOregon's Dan Lanning rips College Football Playoff, calls for major changes\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nTop 2026 NFL Draft prospect suffers broken rib in CFP quarterfinal loss\n\nESPN's grade for LSU hiring Lane Kiffin will make Ole Miss fans even more mad\n\nDabo Swinney fires Clemson coaches immediately after loss to Penn State\n\nOhio State's Ryan Day faces backlash after Cotton Bowl",

He made his first career start against Central Michigan at right guard following an injury to initial starter Brady Norton, and Guarnera started at that spot the rest of the year.\n\nHe was the highest-graded Michigan offensive lineman on Pro Football Focus (69.5 overall grade) in 2025 and is now expected to have a major role for Kyle Whittingham’s first squad in Ann Arbor.\n\nThe interesting part about Guarnera hopping in the portal in the first place is that he told reporters down in Orlando during the week of the Citrus Bowl that he intended to stay with the program, but then entered the portal just a few days later anyways.\n\nRegardless of the exact circumstances that led him to the portal, it’s good to have him officially back in the mix for the 2026 season.

    "fullText": "Ohio State wide receiver Quincy Porter plans to enter the NCAA transfer portal, according to On3’s Hayes Fawcett. Porter wound up spending just one season with the program after being a big-time recruit. He will soon be on the open market and presumably have a ton of suitors waiting on the other end.\n\nPorter played high school football at Oradell (NJ) Bergen Catholic, where he was a five-star prospect. He was the No. 22 overall recruit in the 2025 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies.\n\nOnly two wide receivers were ranked ahead of Porter. Oregon‘s Dakorien Moore was one of them, followed by Kaliq Lockett of the Texas Longhorns.\n\nRivals was higher on Porter than the rest of the industry. He came in as the No. 13 overall prospect in the Rivals300. Only one other service ranked him as a five-star. Expectations for what Porter can become certainly are high.\n\nFew in the college game are better than Brian Hartline at recruiting wide receivers. Hartline got Porter into the mix back in June 2024, holding onto the verbal all the way through National Signing Day. Schools such as Alabama, Michigan, and Penn State were considered other contenders at the time.\n\nHartline is no longer in Columbus, though, after leaving to become USF‘s next head coach. Ohio State did hire Cortez Hankton to replace him as the wide receivers coach. But Porter is still going to at least entertain the idea of continuing his playing days elsewhere.\n\nAs for his on-field production, Porter played in four games this season. Only four catches came his way for a total of 59 yards. Wide receiver is a loaded position at Ohio State, making playing time hard to come by, even for somebody as talented as Porter.\n\nLooking at the future, four years of eligibilty should remain. Porter only playing in four games means a redshirt can be taken by him.\n\nOhio State just saw its season end on New Year’s Eve in the Cotton Bowl. Miami was on the right side of a College Football Playoff quarterfinal, taking down the reigning national champions. Day and the entire Buckeyes staff now work toward building a roster capable of getting back to the top in 2026.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire. The On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.",

It’s expected that the Harbaugh would be the top candidate, hurdling former Browns coach Kevin Stefanski.\n\nWhile nothing has been announced yet, Harbaugh could be scheduled for am immediate in-person interview as an unemployed candidate.\n\nThe Ravens have become the seventh team to have a head coaching vacancy after firing Harbaugh. The Giants have widely been regarded as having the top opening, but the Ravens are clear competition for the top candidates — save Harbaugh.\n\nThere does appear to be a mutual interest between the Giants and Harbaugh. Ian O’Connor of The Athletic is reporting that Harbaugh is likely the Giants’ top target, and the Giants are likely the top opening for Harbaugh.\n\nJohn Harbaugh has a high regard for the Giants job and for Jaxson Dart. Of the six HC openings, I believe he might have the Giants at No. 1, or damn close to it. As I wrote yesterday, I believe he hurdles Kevin Stefanski as the leader in the clubhouse. https://t.co/VQDooMaV74\n\n— Ian O'Connor (@Ian_OConnor) January 6, 2026\n\nHarbaugh will be sought after, per Adam Schefter.\n\nIn the first 45 minutes after John Harbaugh was fired this afternoon, his agent Bryan Harlan said he received calls from seven NFL teams expressing interest in his client. \n\nThere currently are seven NFL head coach openings, including Baltimore’s. pic.twitter.com/ey5vYsLcrZ\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 6, 2026\n\nStefanski will interview in-person on Wednesday, which he is allowed to do because he is not currently employed by a team. Harbaugh would now also fit into that category.\n\nThe Giants have also either requested or are expected to request interviews with Denver Broncos defensive coordinator Vance Joseph, Indianapolis Colts defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo, former Washington Commanders offensive coordinator and Arizona Cardinals head coach Kliff Kingsbury, Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak and Giants interim head coach Mike Kafka.\n\nWriters at SB Nation’s Baltimore Beatdown are trying to process Harbaugh no longer being the Ravens’ coach.",

Wright wrote that, similarly to the recovery process of Wembanyama's calf strain earlier in the season, which resulted in missing 12 games, the 22-year-old will come off San Antonio's bench and play with a minutes restriction.\n\nThe Spurs are hoping that the big man can put the injuries behind him and stay healthy for the rest of the season.\n\nDevin Vassell (adductor) will miss his fourth straight game.\n\nFor the Grizzlies, they have a long list of players missing Tuesday's matchup. Ja Morant (calf), Cedric Coward (ankle), Zach Edey (ankle), Ty Jerome (calf), Brandon Clarke (calf), Scotty Pippen Jr. (toe), and John Konchar (thumb) are all listed as out.\n\nVince Williams Jr. (patellar tendinitis) will be available and most likely be in the starting lineup with all of the injuries to Memphis.\n\nMitch Johnson urges the San Antonio Spurs to start games on the right foot\n\nSteve Kerr admits the Thunder and the Spurs are long-term championship contenders\n\nJulian Champagnie reflects on working hard as an undrafted player\n\nLuke Kornet found success by letting go: Inside Spurs big man's evolution away from 3-point specialist",

    "fullText": "Nebraska football finally has its transfer portal quarterback after some trials and tribulations.\n\nThe Cornhuskers landed a commitment from former UNLV quarterback Anthony Colandrea on Jan. 6, a day after former Notre Dame quarterback Kenny Minchey flipped his pledge from Nebraska to Kentucky. Minchey committed to Nebraska on Jan. 4 before changing his mind Jan. 5.\n\nColandrea was the Mountain West Player of the Year in 2025 after passing for 3,459 yards with 23 touchdowns to nine interceptions, also rushing for 649 yards and 10 scores. He was a two-year starter at Virginia before transferring to UNLV, where he starred for first-year coach Dan Mullen.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Day after committing to Nebraska, Notre Dame QB Kenny Minchey signs with Kentucky\n\nThe 6-foot signal caller is the No. 175-ranked player and No. 21 quarterback, according to 247Sports' transfer portal ratings. He's listed as a three-star recruit, per the recruiting service, and also took a visit to Florida State. Minchey was listed as a four-star recruit and No. 12 quarterback.\n\nColandrea is tasked with replacing two-year starter Dylan Raiola, who entered the transfer portal after suffering a season-ending injury. Raiola, a former five-star recruit, is still uncommitted.\n\nNebraska finished 7-6 in 2025 despite entering the season with lofty expectations. Raiola's injury didn't help, of course, leaving the program with true freshman TJ Lateef, who made four starts. The Cornhuskers went 1-4 in their last five games.\n\nColandrea is looking to bring some much-needed dual-threat ability to an offense that's losing star running back Emmett Johnson to the NFL draft, along with veteran receiver Dane Key.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Nebraska football lands UNLV transfer Anthony Colandrea as next QB",

    "description": "As a child-free couple with remote jobs, we choose not to spend Christmas and New Year's gathering with family. Instead, we travel somewhere new.",
    "fullText": "When most of us think of the holidays, we picture spending them with family — and that's exactly what my husband and I did for over 20 years.\n\nOur tradition was to stay in Los Angeles to be with my parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins, who all lived within driving distance of our home.\n\nIt was always fun eating tamales, dancing to traditional ranchero music, and laughing at my dad's nonsensical jokes. However, as time has passed, things have changed.\n\nOld relationships ended, and new ones began, and loved ones passed away, including my dad and grandparents. Life also took a big turn once my husband and I both started working remotely in 2020.\n\nSince then, we've become much more spontaneous and creative about how we spend the holidays. We never really know where we'll be, and that's part of what makes it so exciting.\n\nMy husband and I are close to our families, so sometimes it still feels a little weird not to spend the holidays with them. But they're supportive of our travels, and we see them throughout the year.\n\nBecause we have no children or pets, we try to make the most of our flexibility and freedom. This is especially true during the holidays, when we usually have one to two weeks off from work.\n\nIt's a chance for us to rest (and reset) our minds, and enjoy each other's company without worrying about deadlines and meetings.\n\nFor the first couple of trips on our own, we stayed within driving distance of home.\n\nAfter several days in Phoenix during the 2021 Christmas holiday break, we rented a condo in the Catalina Foothills of Tucson. It had the most magnificent views of the city, and that trip remains one of my all-time favorites.\n\nAside from our daily walks among the saguaro cactuses, we didn't do anything major, which was exactly the point.\n\nIt was enough to take in the views, bask in the sunshine, and visit a couple of fantastic local spots — Coronet, a top-notch restaurant-bar with a charming outdoor patio, and Motosonora Brewing Company, a cool tap room and beer garden.\n\nThe following year, we continued the relaxed desert theme and spent the holidays in Palm Springs and Joshua Tree, where a couple of friends met up with us. We loved the wide-open skies, stunning natural landscapes, and the overall slower pace.\n\nIn 2023, we wanted to go bigger, so we splurged on a 10-day vacation to Isla Mujeres, a tiny island off the coast of Cancún.\n\nThough this wasn't our favorite trip — and we made a few mistakes planning it — swimming in the warm turquoise waters of the Caribbean was incredible, and we don't regret the experience.\n\nMost recently, we spent the 2025 to 2026 holiday season in Paris, a trip we didn't even plan until the last minute.\n\nMy husband grew up on the East Coast and has missed having a wintry Christmas ever since we've been together, so we figured we may as well go to our favorite city.\n\nIt was magical. From the gorgeous store decorations and festive street lights to the outdoor Christmas markets and cafés serving vin chaud (mulled hot wine), it felt like we were living in a holiday movie — one that we didn't want to end.\n\nFortunately, it didn't have to. Although the holidays are officially over, we were able to extend our stay in Paris through February, where we'll continue working remotely.\n\nThough we absolutely love to travel, we're not wealthy, so we're always mindful of our expenses. But when we feel it's worth it, we don't hesitate because we know life is short, nothing lasts forever, and we want to follow our bliss while we can.",

    "description": "Unnecessary characters, replacing the main star, and adding ridiculous plots are just some of the signs that it's time to call it quits.",
    "fullText": "For every show that we've mourned getting canceled prematurely, there are others chugging along on season eight that have become unwatchable.\n\nWe've compiled a list of 35 shows that didn't need to last as long as they did, whether that's because they should've stayed a limited series, the writers were running out of ideas, or simply because it took too long for the show to come out.\n\nHere are 35 shows that we think overstayed their welcome.\n\nWe were never going to be mad about more \"Stranger Things,\" but we are mad it took a decade to wrap up … and that the finale was on the underwhelming side.\n\nThis is more of a calendar problem than a content problem. When this show started, the \"Stranger Things\" kids were still actually kids. But just five seasons — and a whopping nine years later — these \"kids\" are adults. Like, \"Millie Bobby Brown is a wife and mother\" adults. Maybe that's why it was a bit laughable that the show concluded with its main characters graduating from high school.\n\nIt also became clear during the finale that perhaps this show was never suited to becoming as huge as it did. There's something to be said for seasoned franchise filmmakers knowing how to build an entire universe. The Duffer Brothers, the creators of \"Stranger Things,\" were never that.\n\nSo, was it worth the wait? We'd argue no. We're begging for shows like \"Severance\" to get a more traditional release schedule to avoid wearing out the audience's welcome.\n\nDid \"Suits\" really need to continue after Meghan Markle and Patrick J. Adams left in season seven?\n\nThe show's premise — that Adams' character Mike would be able to stay at a top law firm without a law degree for years without anyone important finding out — was always ridiculous, but the banter between Mike, his boss Harvey (Gabriel Macht), Harvey's secretary Donna (Sarah Rafferty), and paralegal Rachel (Markle), was impossible not to like.\n\nBut when real-life circumstances forced Markle to leave the show — like a royal wedding — Rachel and Mike were written off in the finale of season seven.\n\nAs the relationship between Mike and Harvey was the beating heart of \"Suits,\" it was never the same after they were gone, and the show only lasted two more seasons.\n\nThe 22nd season of \"Grey's Anatomy\" returns this month, but it has overstayed its welcome.\n\nMillions of people watch \"Grey's Anatomy,\" even after 21 years of deaths, breakups, and every natural disaster you could think of — and this show was just supposed to be about a group of surgical interns and their relationship drama!\n\nIt's hard to pinpoint when the saga of Seattle Grace Mercy West/Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital should have ended. After season five, when Katherine Heigl and T. R. Knight left? Or after season eight, when Chyler Leigh and Eric Dane decided to flee Seattle? It almost definitely should have been done after Sandra Oh left in season 10. Or you could argue that it should've been when Justin Chambers, aka the heart of the show, Alex Karev, left in season 16.\n\nHowever, now that Meredith Grey herself, Ellen Pompeo, has decided that it's time to leave Grey Sloan, it's time to pack it up.\n\nThe point is, \"Grey's Anatomy\" has been on the air way too long.\n\n\"Westworld\" was unceremoniously canceled by HBO in 2021 after four seasons, even though the show had at one point been a prestige hit and only needed one more season to wrap up its sprawling story, according to its creators.\n\nAnd now that \"Westworld\" will never get to finish its story, there's an argument to be made that it should've been a one-season limited series.\n\nBut as Business Insider's Kim Renfro pointed out, being a \"Westworld\" fan has been exhausting since season two's extremely confusing, aspect ratio-changing, time-jumping story premiered.\n\nThe first season, now, remains a perfectly entertaining season about a theme park version of the Wild West for the mega-rich who thrived off hurting the park's android population. There was much to dissect about AI, what it means to be human, and how much darkness one person can carry without losing their mind.\n\nRIP, \"Westworld,\" we barely knew you … because we had no idea what was going on half the time.\n\n\"Homeland\" is another example of a show that could've been a limited series but dragged on for eight seasons total.\n\nSpoilers ahead for a show that wrapped up its eighth and final season in 2020. And we're going to tell you a hard truth: Damian Lewis' Nicholas Brody should've died at the end of season one, and that should've been the conclusion of his and CIA case officer Carrie Mathison's story.\n\nInstead, Lewis' chemistry with Claire Danes, who played Carrie Mathison, was so strong that the show kept putting off the inevitable, spinning its wheels until his death in season three.\n\nThen, even though their relationship was the heart of the show, \"Homeland\" went on for five more seasons, each with diminishing returns.\n\n\"The Big Bang Theory\" mercifully pulled the plug after 12 seasons in 2019 and approximately one million \"Bazingas.\"\n\n\"TBBT\" was a pleasant enough show about a group of nerds (and one \"dumb\" woman), but it became way too hacky as the years went by.\n\nSheldon was reduced to a sentient pile of catchphrases (Bazinga, the soft kitty song, to name a couple), and the on/off relationship of Penny and Leonard lost its spark.\n\nThat it went on for 12 seasons, while other underrated comedies got canceled way too soon — looking at you \"Party Down,\" \"Selfie,\" and \"Happy Endings\" — is probably its biggest crime.\n\nWhile we could all use a little more President Bartlet in our lives, it's undeniable that the show lost its true magic when Sorkin, who essentially wrote every script, left after the fourth season in 2003.\n\nThat season could have been a logical endpoint to the series, with Bartlet securing a second term, and the rest of his staff living to see another day.\n\nInstead, the show soldiered on for another three seasons. None of them are bad, but they failed to achieve the same transcendence of Sorkin's episodes, before ending in 2006.\n\n\"Scrubs\" is frequently cited by medical professionals as the most realistic medical show portraying life as a doctor in a hospital, as Slate reported.\n\nIt also provided us with many laughs — and almost as many tears — across its seven seasons on NBC. The network canceled it, and ABC swooped in to pick it up for season eight in 2008.\n\nCreator Bill Lawrence provided fans with a beautiful finale that saw all of our favorite characters riding off into the sunset. Or so it seemed.\n\nABC commissioned one more season of \"Scrubs,\" known unofficially as \"Scrubs Med.\" The show was moved from a hospital to a medical school, only three of the original cast continued to star, and a bunch of new characters were introduced, much to the chagrin of audiences.\n\nThankfully, the show was really canceled after that in 2010, and many fans don't even acknowledge it as canon.\n\nBut, guess what? In 2026, we're heading back to Sacred Heart for a 10th season with Zach Braff, Donald Faison, Sarah Chalke, John C. McGinley, and Judy Reyes, so maybe we'll be taking this show off the list soon.\n\n\"Friends\" is one of the most beloved TV shows of all time, which is why it's painful to admit that it lasted at least one season too long.\n\nGranted, the show revolved around a group of six friends, so storylines were in short supply. But when Rachel and Joey started dating in season 10, after nine seasons of having no interest in each other whatsoever, it became clear that the writers had run out of material.\n\nAdditionally, the characters became loud, obnoxious caricatures of themselves. Try watching an episode from the first season of \"Friends,\" and then one from the 10th season — the differences are startling.\n\nWhen Variety reported in 2015 that HBO was adapting Liane Moriarty's best-selling novel \"Big Little Lies,\" starring Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Shailene Woodley, Laura Dern, and Zoë Kravitz, the expectations could not have been higher.\n\nAnd when it premiered in 2017, it lived up to all of them. The cast had amazing chemistry, the story was well-paced and sufficiently ominous, and the soundtrack was superb.\n\nWhen \"Big Little Lies\" won multiple Emmys in the limited-series category, it became clear that there were no plans to artificially extend the story past what Moriarty had written in the book.\n\nBut two years later, we were back in Monterey. Even though season two gave us Meryl Streep's screaming, \"Big Little Lies\" should've stayed a limited series.\n\nHollywood, stop doing this! If your show was based on a single book, it almost never pays off to extend the story — there's a reason the author didn't write a sequel.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the long-threatened third season will actually happen.\n\nThere are some who argue that there shouldn't have even been one season of \"13 Reasons Why,\" a Netflix show based on the novel of the same name. Critics claimed the show, which premiered in 2017, \"glorified\" suicide and sent the wrong message to teens.\n\nBut whether you agree with it or not, even the biggest fans of the show have to admit that the story after season one went completely off the rails.\n\nThis show started as the story of Hannah Baker (Katherine Langford), a teenager struggling with anxiety and depression, who recorded 13 tapes, each dedicated to a different person she blamed for her eventual suicide.\n\nBut by the time season four rolled around in 2020, Hannah was long forgotten, and the show had turned into a murder-mystery thriller with extra trauma thrown in for no discernible reason, as NME wrote.\n\nIf you were on Twitter (now X) during an episode of \"Pretty Little Liars,\" you might remember how captivating this show about a group of friends getting terrorized by an anonymous stalker named \"A\" used to be — it was a phenomenon.\n\nBut the show's runaway success led to it promising to reveal who the real \"A\" was every single season. Even though the identity of \"A\" was revealed in season two, more \"As\" popped up every season.\n\nHow many \"As\" could there be? The show only got more confusing as it went on, and mercifully ended after season seven in 2017 — though there were also two spinoffs.\n\n\"The Vampire Diaries\" probably should have called it quits after the show's star, Nina Dobrev, left in season six. It finally ended two years later.\n\n\"The Vampire Diaries\" originally started as a love triangle between Elena (played by Dobrev) and two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon, but as seasons went on, the show lost focus.\n\nStill, it kept going and doubled down on the (polarizing) romance between Damon and Elena. Arguably, it was never able to recreate its storytelling highs of season two.\n\nThe show's sixth season ended with Elena in a coma, and curiously continued without her for another two unnecessary seasons.\n\nWithout Elena, the main character, the show struggled, and finally came to an end after season eight in 2017 — though you could continue some characters' journeys on \"The Originals\" and \"Legacies\" until they ended in 2018 and 2022, respectively.\n\n\"One Tree Hill,\" a show about a group of high school friends in a small North Carolina town called Tree Hill, would have been great if it had said goodbye after high school graduation.\n\nThe post-high school stretch of \"OTH\" just had way too much going on, becoming confusing and soap opera-esque.\n\nThe show attempted to bypass the college problem that many high school TV shows encounter by jumping four years into the future, which was inventive at first, but became sort of ridiculous: the high level of success and fame this one group of friends had achieved was unbelievable.\n\nIt ended in 2012 after season nine, arguably five years after its prime.\n\nIn 2024, Variety reported that stars Sophia Bush and Hilarie Burton were working on an \"OTH\" revival with Netflix, so there might be more yet.\n\n\"Scandal\" became increasingly ridiculous and soapy as time went on, ultimately concluding in 2018.\n\nIt could be argued that the show never recovered from the introduction of the all-knowing, super-scary Black-Ops intelligence organization, B-613.\n\nThat's when \"Scandal\" pivoted from a political case-of-the-week drama with an ongoing love story between political \"fixer\" Olivia Pope and the US president to a frankly unwatchable soap opera in which every character either became a murderer or died, and spent most of their time yelling at someone.\n\n\"Once Upon a Time\" was rightfully canceled in 2018 after its low-rated seventh season. The show had tried to continue after ditching six of its main characters, but it would have made more sense to pull the plug.\n\nThe premise of \"Once Upon a Time\" — that fairytale characters are all real and living in a fictional town in Maine — was interesting for a season or two, but as the show went on, the connections between characters became more and more unbelievable. Plus, by the end, basically every character on the show was somehow related.\n\n\"Family Guy's\" creator, Seth MacFarlane, admitted that he has conflicting ideas about his show. In 2011, MacFarlane told The Hollywood Reporter, \"Part of me thinks that 'Family Guy' should have already ended. I think seven seasons is about the right lifespan for a TV series.\"\n\nIt's hard to argue with that, especially since the misadventures of the Rhode Island-dwelling Griffin family are wearing a little thin these days.\n\nHowever, season 24 is set to kick off in February, and as Variety reported, the show is guaranteed to air through season 29.\n\n\"Glee\" really started to go off the rails when some of the original characters graduated high school.\n\nThinking about \"Glee\" in 2023 is difficult, considering the tragedy of Cory Monteith's overdose, Naya Rivera's unexpected death, and the death of Mark Salling, who was charged with the possession of child-sexual-abuse material.\n\nBut the show probably should have taken its final bow after a couple of seasons. In a review of the 2015 series finale for Vox, one critic even wrote that the show \"got bad\" in its second episode.\n\nThe novelty of turning popular songs into show choir performances wore off quickly, and the show's replacement characters in season four, after much of the Glee Club graduated from high school, never quite worked.\n\nMany people claim that the 2012 reveal that Dan Humphrey, resident New York City \"Lonely Boy,\" was actually Gossip Girl ruined the show for them … but the show was pretty ruined long before that.\n\n\"Gossip Girl\" is an example of a show not being sustainable after the high school years. It didn't make sense that all of the main characters went to college in Manhattan: Blair, Serena, Nate, and Dan had all expressed their desire to leave the city for college.\n\nPlus, by season four, it didn't make sense for any of them to still be hanging out together. They all openly hated each other.\n\nIf there's one thing fans can agree on, it's that the final season of \"Gilmore Girls\" — a show about a young mother-daughter pair in small-town Connecticut — is a mess, due to the show's heart and soul, writer and producer Amy Sherman-Palladino, leaving in 2006.\n\nBut some argue that the mediocrity of season seven is actually her fault. Season six was a radical departure from the hijinks of perpetually happy town \"Stars Hollow,\" and instead focused on Rory and her mom not speaking, and the slow, painful demise of Luke and Lorelai's engagement.\n\nThe 2016 Netflix reboot \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" somehow made it even worse, showing that Rory had gone through little to no personal growth since the show ended, and that Lorelai and Luke had made no progress on their communication issues that had been present since their romance first began in season five.\n\n\"24\" had an innovative premise: Each week's episode was in real time, and each season covered a single day. But it definitely didn't need eight seasons, a 2008 TV movie, a 2014 revival, and a 2017 spin-off.\n\nRealistically, how many seasons of CTU (Counter Terrorist Unit) agent Jack Bauer saving the world, getting betrayed, torturing someone, and getting chased by the federal government can you watch? At least nine, its creators thought.\n\n\"24,\" which was initially praised for its inventive structure and its willingness to kill main characters and take big risks, got old pretty quickly.\n\nBut the show became formulaic after a couple of years, and the amount of pain and suffering each \"day\" put Jack through became unnecessary — his wife, four girlfriends, father, and brother are all killed over the course of the show.\n\nOne of the pillars of the Superman canon is that Clark becomes Superman when he moves to Metropolis from his small town of, well, Smallville.\n\nBut \"Smallville\" didn't get that memo, because Clark moves to Metropolis in season five with no red cape in sight. He didn't even wear the suit until the 2011 series finale (which is also when he finally learned to fly).\n\nYes, it took \"Smallville\" an excruciating 10 seasons for Clark Kent to finally become Superman.\n\nTo be fair, the creators of \"Smallville\" probably had no idea that the show would last for 10 seasons when they instituted their \"No tights, no flights\" policy, but that doesn't make it any less annoying.\n\n\"That '70s Show\" took place from 1976 to 1979, but the show lasted for eight seasons. It took five years for the core crew to graduate high school, so naturally, the show began to drag. You can only watch a group of friends sit in a basement and get stoned for so long.\n\nBut the show should have ended for good when Topher Grace, who played the main character Eric Forman, chose to leave after season seven in 2005.\n\nThen, Ashton Kutcher, who played Kelso, left after the first four episodes of season eight — and was replaced by an almost universally hated character named Randy (sorry, Josh Meyers!).\n\nFans were also angry when Fez and Jackie began a relationship, seemingly out of nowhere, effectively ending the fan-favorite relationship between Jackie and Hyde.\n\nEven though the 2023 sequel series \"That '90s Show\" (which was canceled after two seasons) confirmed that Jackie and Kelso got back together and brought back Eric, we'd be fine without it.\n\nIt became apparent that \"The Office\" was running out of stories to tell after Jim and Pam finally got married in the show's sixth season. The writers kept throwing unrealistic obstacles at them, such as a random cameraman who was suddenly in love with Pam. Adding such a melodramatic plot to a workplace sitcom like \"The Office\" (about a paper company in Pennsylvania) didn't make any sense.\n\nBut the final nail in the coffin of \"The Office\" was Steve Carell's decision to exit after seven seasons as the lovably incompetent Michael Scott.\n\nSeason eight was the first season of the sitcom to achieve a rotten score on Rotten Tomatoes. It would have been better to go out on a high note.\n\nUrban Dictionary defines jumping the shark as \"a term to describe a moment when something that was once great has reached a point where it will now decline in quality and popularity.\"\n\nWhere did such an oddly specific expression come from? Look no further than the season five premiere of \"Happy Days,\" in which Fonzie, played by Henry Winkler, literally jumps over a shark on water-skis. This stunt left people confused — wasn't this supposed to be a show about small-town '50s nostalgia?\n\n\"Happy Days\" lasted for 11 seasons from 1974 to 1984, but many people cite the jumping of the shark as a turning point in \"Happy Days\" history.\n\n\"Weeds,\" a show about a suburban single mom who grows and sells marijuana to support her family, started with such promise. It was a fascinating look at what goes on behind closed doors in suburbia — until it became more focused on drug cartels, murder, and generally unpleasant subject matter.\n\nSeasons one and two, in which Nancy (Mary-Louise Parker) is a low-level marijuana dealer in the small California town of Agrestic, are nearly perfect.\n\nBut when the show crossed the border into Mexico? Not so much.\n\nIt's borderline impossible to find someone who watched \"Weeds\" all the way until the end in 2012, when it became way too dark to enjoy.\n\n\"True Blood\" kicked off the vampire craze in 2008, a month before \"Twilight\" hit the big screen, and a year before \"The Vampire Diaries\" premiered on The CW.\n\nAnd for three seasons, it was a campy, bloody, sexy show about Sookie, a psychic waitress, her complicated relationships with hot vampires, and the lives of her family and friends.\n\nBut \"True Blood\" went downhill after it was revealed that Sookie was a fairy. She described it best when she found out the news: \"I'm a fairy? How ... lame.\"\n\nAfter this reveal, the writers scrambled to find more ways to integrate other mythological creatures, with little success.\n\nOriginal showrunner Alan Ball abandoned ship after season five, according to The Hollywood Reporter, and \"True Blood\" should have gone down with him.\n\nThe show ended on a low note in 2014, which is something that fans are still angry about to this day.\n\n\"How I Met Your Mother\" should not have gone on for nine years, simply because taking nine seasons to tell one story is almost cruel to viewers — especially the eagle-eyed, devoted fans who spent years dissecting every episode looking for clues and Easter eggs as to the identity of the titular mother.\n\nThe slow pace of the story angered both Ted's kids and fans, and the show became less funny over time.\n\nMaybe if the show had spent only four or five years building up the mother, as opposed to almost an entire decade, fans would have been able to swallow Ted and Robin (his ex-girlfriend and best friend's ex-wife) ending up together, instead of raging that it was one of the worst endings of all time.\n\nDexter was a serial killer who trained himself to only kill bad guys, but the show became less appealing, and more unrealistic, especially when writers increasingly tried to humanize Dexter.\n\nEven if you were rooting for Dexter, it became impossible to watch him face no consequences for his actions — every time someone came close to exposing him, someone else killed the threat, instead of Dexter being forced to abandon his moral code to kill an innocent person.\n\nAdditionally, the 2013 series finale has become widely regarded as one of the worst ever, although it was slightly redeemed by the subsequent revivals and prequel: \"Dexter: New Blood,\" \"Dexter: Original Sin,\" and \"Dexter: Resurrection.\"\n\nWhen \"Modern Family\" premiered in 2009, it was universally loved by fans and critics, as evidenced by high Rotten Tomatoes scores.\n\nIn fact, it was nominated for best comedy series at the Emmys seven years in a row, winning five consecutive years. It was a true 21st-century comedy, telling the story of a giant family that includes a gay couple, an interracial couple, divorce, and adoption.\n\nHowever, when it lost the award for the first time in 2015, it should've been a clue that it was probably time to start wrapping things up. Yet, the show continued, and even though it wasn't nominated for anything in 2018, it soldiered on for a 10th season.\n\nThe show finally ended in April 2020.\n\n\"Desperate Housewives\" began in 2004 as an intriguing mystery about a group of friends who were rocked by their friend Mary Alice's shocking suicide.\n\nBut as the years went by, characters became more unlikable and plots more nonsensical — remember when Edie was electrocuted after surviving a car crash? Eight seasons were just too much time to invest in the ladies of Wisteria Lane.\n\nOne of the show's titular two-and-a-half men, Charlie Sheen, left the show after eight seasons in 2011. He was dismissed after insulting the show and its creator, Chuck Lorre, Deadline reported, amongst other things, during a public meltdown.\n\nThe sitcom — about a wimpy chiropractor Alan, his underachieving son Jake, and his ladies' man brother Charlie — soldiered on for four more seasons by replacing Charlie with a depressed billionaire, Walden, who was played by Ashton Kutcher.\n\nThe show ended on a low note in 2015, with IGN writing \"don't think [we] could come up with a worse ending.\"\n\nThe truth is, the show was already in a downward spiral before Sheen left, but his departure should have been the final nail in the coffin.\n\nIn the end, it turns out \"Supernatural\" isn't immortal, like so many of its characters.\n\nThe show dealt with all sorts of otherworldly creatures, such as angels, demons, vampires, werewolves, and leprechauns, among others, and two brothers (Dean and Sam Winchester) were tasked with eradicating the world from these evils.\n\nNot many, if any, shows can remain fresh for 300 episodes. There's only so many times someone can go to hell and back before it loses its oomph, which is probably why the show ended after 15 years.\n\nIt's always a risky move when shows finally let their central couple be together — the romantic tension is usually much more fun.\n\n\"Castle\" started in 2009 as a procedural about a smarmy mystery novelist, the titular Castle, tagging along with a no-nonsense homicide detective, Beckett. The two had chemistry, and for four seasons, they danced around their obvious feelings for each other.\n\nBut when the two finally got together, the show lost some of its mojo. The show had to twist itself into knots to inject conflict into their relationship instead of letting them be happy, frustrating fans to no end throughout the next four seasons until its end in 2016.",

    "description": "Taylor Swift's new single \"The Fate of Ophelia\" debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, joining hits like \"Blank Space\" and \"Anti-Hero.\"",
    "fullText": "Despite writing ubiquitous hits like \"You Belong With Me\" and \"Love Story\" earlier in her career (which peaked at No. 2 and No. 4, respectively), \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" was Swift's first-ever song to top the Hot 100.\n\nThe country-pop crossover smash was released as the lead single from Swift's fourth album, \"Red.\" It rose from No. 72 to No. 1 in its second week of tracking and remained atop the chart for two more weeks.\n\n\"Shake It Off\" was released as the lead single from Swift's fifth album, \"1989.\" It became her first No. 1 debut on the Hot 100.\n\n\"Blank Space,\" the second single from \"1989,\" debuted at No. 18 on the Hot 100.\n\nIt rose to No. 13 before soaring to No. 1 in its third week — dethroning \"Shake It Off\" and making Swift the first woman in history to replace herself in the chart's top spot.\n\n\"Blank Space\" went on to become one of Swift's biggest hits, reigning atop the chart for nearly two months.\n\nDespite mixed reactions from critics, Swift's lead single from \"Reputation\" rose to No. 1 after its first full week of tracking, breaking the weekly streaming record for a song by a woman.\n\nOnce again, Swift's music video broke the record for most views within 24 hours, racking up 43.2 million views in its first day.\n\nSwift announced the arrival of her eighth album, \"Folklore,\" just one day in advance. The second track, \"Cardigan,\" was released at the same time as the album and promoted with a whimsical music video.\n\n\"Folklore\" debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 while \"Cardigan\" simultaneously debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, making Swift the first artist in history to open atop both charts in the same week.\n\nJust five months after \"Folklore,\" Swift repeated her pandemic-era strategy and surprise-released her ninth album, \"Evermore,\" alongside its lead single.\n\nAgain, \"Willow\" debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100 while \"Evermore\" simultaneously debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.\n\n\"Red (Taylor's Version)\" was the second rerecorded album Swift released. It was accompanied by the long-awaited 10-minute version of \"All Too Well,\" a fan-favorite track from the original album.\n\n\"All Too Well (Taylor's Version)\" was promoted with a self-directed short film and plenty of theories about the song's most likely muse.\n\nIt debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, becoming the longest song in history to top the chart. The record was previously held by Don McLean's \"American Pie (Parts I & II)\" at 8 minutes and 37 seconds.\n\n\"Anti-Hero\" was released alongside Swift's 10th album, \"Midnights,\" and promoted as the lead single.\n\nIt dominated the Hot 100 for eight weeks, surpassing the high-water mark set by \"Blank Space.\"\n\nThe same week that \"Anti-Hero\" debuted at No. 1, Swift became the first and only artist in history to occupy the entire top 10 on the Hot 100. The hit single was flanked by \"Lavender Haze\" (No. 2), \"Maroon\" (No. 3), \"Snow on the Beach\" (No. 4), \"Midnight Rain\" (No. 5), \"Bejeweled\" (No. 6), \"Question...?\" (No. 7), \"You're On Your Own, Kid\" (No. 8), \"Karma\" (No. 9), and \"Vigilante Shit\" (No. 10).\n\n\"Cruel Summer\" was originally released as the second track on Swift's 2019 album \"Lover.\"\n\nAlthough it was identified early as a fan favorite, the song was never promoted as a single and debuted modestly at No. 29 on the Hot 100.\n\nFour years later, Swift transformed \"Cruel Summer\" into a showstopping spectacle on the Eras Tour. Streams of the song began to surge, and it reigned atop Billboard's Pop Airplay chart for two months. Swift's label sent the song to pop radio in June 2023.\n\nFinally, following the release of \"The Cruelest Summer\" EP — which includes a live version of the song and a remix by LP Giobbi — the song reached No. 1 on the Hot 100, marking Swift's milestone 10th chart-topper.\n\n\"Is It Over Now?\" was released as the final vault track on \"1989 (Taylor's Version),\" a rerecording of her beloved fifth album.\n\nAlthough it wasn't initially slated as a single, its enthusiastic reception from fans pushed Swift's team to serve the song to pop radio.\n\n\"Is It Over Now?\" debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, dethroning \"Cruel Summer.\" Swift remains the only woman in history to replace herself in the top spot, a feat she's now achieved twice.\n\n\"Fortnight,\" a duet with Post Malone, was released alongside \"The Tortured Poets Department\" and promoted as the album's lead single.\n\nThe song debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100 while \"Poets\" simultaneously debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.\n\nFor the second time in her career, Swift managed to occupy the entire top 10 of the Hot 100. In fact, the top 14 positions on the chart were occupied by \"Poets\" tracks, including \"Down Bad\" (No. 2) and \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart\" (No. 3), all the way through to \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\" (No. 14).\n\n\"Fortnight\" returned to No. 1 on the Hot 100 for a second consecutive week.\n\n\"The Fate of Ophelia\" was released alongside Swift's 12th studio album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" and promoted as the lead single.\n\nThe Shakespeare-inspired pop song debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, while \"Showgirl\" simultaneously debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, breaking a record for the biggest sales week of all time.\n\nAll 12 tracks on the album debuted within the Hot 100's top 12 spots, making Swift the first and only artist to dominate the chart's top 10 on three separate occasions. \"The Fate of Ophelia\" was joined in the top five by \"Opalite\" (No. 2), \"Elizabeth Taylor\" (No. 3), \"Father Figure\" (No. 4), and \"Wood\" (No. 5).\n\n\"The Fate of Ophelia\" remained atop the Hot 100 for eight straight weeks after its release. After falling to lower positions during the holiday season, it returned to No. 1 for its ninth week, surpassing \"Anti-Hero\" as Swift's longest-leading hit to date.",

    "description": "Shareholders voted down a takeover bid for Core Scientific late last year because it wasn't rich enough. Here's why they think the bet will pay off.",
    "fullText": "The investment manager who helped scuttle one of the biggest data center acquisitions of 2025 believes that his bet against the multibillion-dollar buyout is about to pay off in the new year.\n\nTrip Miller, the founder and managing partner of the Memphis-based investment firm Gullane Capital Partners, believes that Core Scientific, a data center developer and operator, is on the cusp of large new customer deals that will boost its value.\n\n\"I think over the next 90 days, you'll see them announce greater than a hundred megawatts of deals,\" Miller said. \"It would show that there was a lot more value to be tapped there than we were getting paid for under the CoreWeave deal.\"\n\nIn October, Miller, a major shareholder in Core Scientific, opposed an offer by the artificial intelligence cloud firm CoreWeave to acquire Core Scientific in a stock conversion deal that he felt undervalued the company. The purchase was originally valued at around $9 billion when it was announced in July, but fell to almost half of that when shares of CoreWeave dipped in the ensuing months. Shareholders in the firm rejected the deal in a vote on October 30 that reflected the concerns over the deal's weakened economics.\n\nMiller said that his expectation for the roughly 100 megawatts of near-term commitments was based on conversations he has had with knowledgeable parties outside of the company's management. He projected that the company will find takers for a total of roughly 400 megawatts this year, citing strong demand for AI computing power.\n\nAsked about the potential for upcoming leasing, a spokeswoman for Core Scientific said the company \"does not comment on market rumors or speculation.\"\n\nThe commitments, if they materialize, would show that data center developers with a runway for growth are increasingly valuable in an energy-constrained building boom.\n\nCore Scientific has disclosed that it has about 1 gigawatt of data center capacity and another 1.5 gigawatts of power for expansion, according to an October investor presentation.\n\nIt would also offer a competing view that the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent on data centers, computer chips, and power infrastructure are in support of a durable AI boom, not a bubble.\n\n\"We are in a situation where we're likely to be systematically short compute —where the demand for compute will outstrip the supply,\" Stephen Byrd, Morgan Stanley's global head of thematic research and sustainability research, said.\n\nIn a report published in December, Morgan Stanley suggested that one of the most significant hurdles for the AI industry will be the gargantuan loads of power required to drive its computing.\n\nMorgan Stanley projects that data centers, the vast facilities that handle the training for large language AI models and the inference computations that put them to work in everyday applications, face a 47 gigawatt shortfall of electricity from the grid nationally by 2028 — a gap almost 10 times the size of New York City's energy footprint on an average day.\n\nAmong the chief beneficiaries are crypto mining firms that have access to in-place power and utility contracts to light up new facilities quickly.\n\nBoth Core Scientific and CoreWeave were former crypto mining companies before repurposing their businesses to focus on AI in recent years.\n\nAmid the mounting shortage of power — along with headwinds in the crypto mining business — more of the industry is turning to data center computing.\n\nByrd said Morgan Stanley anticipates that about 12 gigawatts of mining facilities, about 60% the mining industry's current gigawattage, will convert over to AI and high-performance computing in the next three years.\n\nIn September, Cipher Mining announced it would build a data center in Colorado City, Texas, with 168 megawatts of computing capacity that will be leased to the AI cloud company, Fluidstack. Cipher's stock, which had been trading in August for around $5 a share, jumped as high as roughly $25 in November after the announcement.\n\nIren, another mining firm, announced a recent $9.7 billion AI cloud computing deal with Microsoft. Last month, Hut 8, said it had signed a deal to lease a 245-megawatt data center it is developing in Louisiana to Fluidstack.\n\n\"Our view is that crypto miners, by and large, are likely to pivot for the most part to delivering high-performance compute infrastructure solutions and services,\" Paul Golding, an analyst at Macquarie who covers the crypto mining industry, said.\n\nIn July 2025, CoreWeave said it had reached an agreement to acquire Core Scientific in a stock conversion. But in the months after the announcement, CoreWeave's shares declined and Core Scientific's rose, effectively reducing the value of CoreWeave's offer.\n\nSince the deal's collapse, shares of Core Scientific have traded as low as below $14 a share — less than the $17 per share price that the CoreWeave deal would have amounted to.\n\nGolding covers Core Scientific and has set a $34 target for the company's stock in October, more than double its current market price — upside that he sees stemming from its ability to tap power in a constrained utility market. That estimate is \"based on a sum of the parts that evaluated potential value for the uncontracted megawatts in the portfolio, the megawatt pipeline in load study phase, and the existing co-location deal with CoreWeave,\" Golding said.\n\nCoreWeave is Core Scientific's only data center customer, outside of legacy crypto mining facilities it operates. Core Scientific leases 590 megawatts to CoreWeave, worth roughly $10 billion in revenue over the next 12 years, according to a spokeswoman for the company. It plans to repurpose 400 megawatts of its crypto mining operations over to high-performance computing in the next three years, the spokeswoman said.\n\nMiller said that the upcoming leases he expects Core Scientific to announce will be with new customers.\n\n\"I expect them to announce deals for AI with third parties other than CoreWeave,\" Miller said.",

Mahoney, a former senior Microsoft legal executive and onetime Trump administration official, as its next chief legal officer, Axios reported.\n\nMahoney will replace Jennifer Newstead, who announced in December that she would leave Meta after more than five years to become Apple's general counsel. Mahoney is set to start on Wednesday and will report directly to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the Axios report said.\n\n\"I'm excited to join Meta as it leads the way in AI innovation and continues to connect people around the world,\" Mahoney said in a statement that Meta shared with Business Insider. \"As I close an incredible chapter at Microsoft and begin a new one at Meta, I'm grateful for the trust Mark and the Board have placed in me.\"\n\n\"C.J. brings world-class legal expertise, passion for frontier technology, and deep insight into the global regulatory challenges facing our industry,\" said Zuckerberg in a statement shared with Business Insider. \"I'm looking forward to working with him to advance Meta's mission to build the future of human connection.\"\n\nMahoney previously served as Microsoft's corporate vice president and deputy general counsel and earlier worked as deputy US trade representative during President Donald Trump's first term.\n\nIn his new role, he will oversee Meta's global legal strategy as the company continues to face scrutiny over antitrust, data privacy, online safety, and the protection of children and teenagers.\n\nNewstead's departure marked the end of a consequential period for Meta's legal team. During her tenure, the company secured a major win against the Federal Trade Commission when a federal judge rejected the agency's attempt to force Meta to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nMahoney's appointment comes as Meta continues to navigate intensifying regulatory pressure worldwide, including debates over artificial intelligence, social media governance, and data protection.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Amazon's Prime Video and MrBeast debut 'Beast Games' Season 2, offering copyright-free reactions to maximize promotion.",
    "fullText": "MrBeast is blurring the lines between YouTube and TV in a new way with the release of season two of his reality TV hit, \"Beast Games,\" on Amazon's Prime Video.\n\nThe superstar YouTuber, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, announced that the first episode will be copyright-free. That'll enable people to share reaction clips to their heart's content without fear of repercussions on platforms like Google's YouTube and Amazon's Twitch. The show kicks off on Wednesday.\n\nIt's only for one episode, but it gives MrBeast a way to have his TV cake and eat it, too — and for Amazon to juice exposure for the show.\n\nThe Amazon deal exposed MrBeast to a new audience and enabled him to create a big-budget spectacle that would have been difficult to make economically viable if it ran on YouTube. However, a potential risk was that MrBeast's fans might not follow him to Prime Video, which is behind a paywall requiring a Prime membership.\n\nLast year, MrBeast uploaded part of the first season to YouTube to ensure his fans on that platform were aware of it. MrBeast is YouTube's top creator, with over 450 million subscribers, and regularly receives more than 100 million views and numerous comments on his YouTube videos.\n\nTraditional media companies, such as Netflix and Fox, have been trying to stay relevant with younger viewers by striking deals with YouTube creators. The loss of fan interaction and decreased reach are concerns for some creators, though. In negotiating deals with podcasters, Netflix has told talent agents that it's exploring how to replicate community features for podcast hosts that it brings onto its platform.\n\nSeason 2 of \"Beast Games,\" which features 100 \"strong\" and 100 \"smart\" contestants competing for more than $10 million in prizes, blends elements of TV and digital platforms in other ways.\n\nIt'll include a crossover episode with \"Survivor,\" the famous reality TV show that \"Beast Games\" took inspiration from. And Twitch is promoting the season kickoff with a VIP screening on Tuesday featuring streamers alongside MrBeast.",

    "fullText": "Satellite imagery released in the aftermath of US airstrikes launched in support of the operation to apprehend Nicolás Maduro shows damage beyond a major military base.\n\nA satellite photo taken on Saturday by the US commercial imaging company Planet Labs PBC and obtained by Business Insider shows damage at the Higuerote Airport on Venezuela's northern coast, several dozen miles east of the capital Caracas.\n\nA crater or burn mark can be seen adjacent to the eastern end of the runway, and another on the apron near a collection of buildings.\n\nVideo shared on social media appeared to show explosions and fires at Higuerote Airport during the surprise US operation, Absolute Resolve, which began late Friday night and continued for several more hours into Saturday morning.\n\nVenezuela's air defenses are primarily comprised of Russian-made technology. US fighter jets, surveillance planes, bombers, and drones targeted these systems at the beginning of the raid, effectively clearing a path for low-flying helicopter apprehension forces to locate and capture the former president, Maduro, and his wife.\n\n\"Seems those Russian air defenses didn't quite work so well, did they?\" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said during remarks at the Newport News Shipyard in Virginia on Monday.\n\nIn addition to the damage seen at Higuerote Airport, satellite imagery taken by the US spatial intelligence firm Vantor revealed significant damage to buildings and equipment at Fuerte Tiuna, a major military installation in Caracas that houses defense ministries, critical commands, official residences, and other strategic infrastructure.\n\nConflict analysts at the Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank, said that geolocated footage indicated American forces also targeted port infrastructure, telecommunication towers, and an airbase in and around Caracas.\n\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment on the targets struck during Operation Absolute Resolve. The White House directed BI to the Saturday press briefing on the mission.\n\nMore than 150 US aircraft participated in the mission to capture Maduro, which relied on months of extensive planning and rehearsal, including building a replica of Maduro's compound that American personnel stormed. US intelligence agencies had mapped out details and patterns of his life in advance.\n\nThe operation marked a dramatic culmination of months of rising tensions between the Trump administration and Maduro, whom the US has accused of facilitating drug trafficking and other criminal activity. The ousted leader is now in New York facing narco-terrorism charges. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe US established a large military presence in the Caribbean over the past few months, deploying an aircraft carrier strike group, cruisers, destroyers, advanced fighter jets, and thousands of troops.\n\nSince early September, the US has carried out dozens of airstrikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, killing more than 100 people in a campaign that drew sharp criticism from lawmakers and legal experts.\n\nIt is unclear how long the US will maintain this force presence in the region. President Donald Trump issued warnings to several neighboring countries over the weekend — including Cuba, Colombia, and Mexico — raising concerns of additional military action. He has also threatened Venezuela with follow-on strikes if it doesn't cooperate.",

These networks and their websites will display data from Kalshi that shows what its users think are the probabilities of different market and economic outcomes. For example, CNN could show Kalshi prediction data about which political party users think will control the Senate after the 2026 midterm elections.",

    "description": "Business Insider is on the ground at Las Vegas CES 2026. Here's everything we learned on self-driving cars and robotaxis,",
    "fullText": "Business Insider is taking on CES 2026.\n\nI'm on the ground in Las Vegas from Tuesday to Thursday, taking in all there is to know about the latest in the driverless space.\n\nRobotaxis and self-driving cars have already had an outsize presence at the tech conference, especially in the previous hype cycle of the late 2010s and early 2020s.\n\nThings have changed since then. The industry has largely moved on from mere concepts and technology validation to: How are we going to realistically scale autonomy?\n\nIt's day one of the conference, and there's already a lot to take in.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang unveiled the Alpamayo family, which will serve as an autonomous-driving stack for OEMs to deal with those stubborn edge cases — or the \"long tail\" of self-driving.\n\nUber and Nuro showed off an early look at the Lucid Gravity SUV that the companies hope public riders will be able to take by late 2026.\n\nI'll be spending less time at keynotes and speaker events and more on real-life demonstrations and meetings with industry leaders and commentators in autonomy\n\nThink of this as my personal notebook, where I jot down everything I've learned and seen at the conference.\n\nCheck back in for more updates.\n\nThis is the first year Zoox, an Amazon-backed robotaxi company, will be giving live demonstrations of its service during CES.\n\nI got to take a ride in one on Monday night in front of Resorts World. (The company tagline that I saw from an ad at the Harry Reid International Airport was: \"Don't just do the Strip. Zoox it.\")\n\nMy immediate thoughts were that Zoox feels unlike any other robotaxi or pseudo-robotaxi on the market. It felt more like I was on a theme park ride than in an everyday car we're familiar with.\n\nUnlike Waymo's robotaxis, Zoox is not a regular car you could buy that's been retrofitted with sensors. The Zoox car is bi-directional — meaning there's no real front or back of the car — and the inside has no steering wheel, just seats.\n\nThe robotaxis were clearly a great tourist attraction from what I saw. My Uber driver wasn't too happy about them.\n\nUber, Lucid, and Nuro had a swanky cocktail hour at Fontainebleau Las Vegas, where they quite literally wined and dined a room full of reporters, analysts, and investors: endless glasses of wine and an open bar, lobster tails, jumbo shrimp, too many appetizers to count, and a giant charcuterie board — the works.\n\nMaybe understandably so? 2026 will be a big year for the three companies.\n\nUber's plan is to roll out a robotaxi service by late 2026. The first market is San Francisco, where Uber will directly compete with Waymo. These two companies are partners in other markets, like Austin.\n\n\"We've been moving very, very quickly,\" Nuro's co-CEO and cofounder Dave Ferguson said. \"We signed this partnership last July. We're already testing the production-intent vehicles on public roads. And very soon, we're going to have tens of thousands of them worldwide.\"",

These will then be delivered to US, allied, and partner forces.\n\nGlobal demand for capable air defenses and interceptors has surged in recent years in response to the large missile attacks seen in Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine and in Middle East conflicts. The American-made MIM-104 Patriot air defense system has been at the center of both.\n\nThe surface-to-air missile system has served as the backbone of Ukraine's defense against Russian missile strikes, functioning as the top layer of an air defense network largely supported by Western-made technology. And the US military has relied on the Patriot to intercept Iranian attacks.\n\nThe high expenditure rate for Patriot interceptors over the last few years has raised concerns about future stockpiles for US and allied arsenals.\n\nJim Taiclet, Lockheed's chairman and CEO, said in a statement that the defense prime \"will create unprecedented capacity for PAC-3 MSE production, delivering at the speed our nation and allies demand.\"\n\nLockheed said that it had boosted PAC-3 MSE production by more than 60% over the past two years and delivered 620 missile interceptors in 2025, a 20% increase from 2024.\n\nThe contractor supplies 17 countries with its PAC-3 interceptors. It considers the MSE variant a \"cornerstone\" of US and European missile defense.\n\nThe Pentagon said that the agreement announced on Tuesday is a result of its new Acquisition Transformation Strategy, which Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth revealed in November and calls for increased production capacity for key weapons and munitions, among other priorities.\n\nHegseth said at the time that the Pentagon would award companies bigger and longer contracts for \"proven systems\" so that they could invest \n\nThe framework agreement announced on Tuesday \"establishes the basis for negotiating a seven-year supply contract\" that will still need Congressional approval, the Pentagon said.\n\n\"This framework agreement marks a fundamental shift in how we rapidly expand munitions production and magazine depth, and how we collaborate with our industry partners,\" said Michael Duffey, the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, in a statement.",

    "fullText": "Seven US service members were injured during the covert raid to apprehend Nicolás Maduro over the weekend, a defense official told Business Insider on Tuesday, sharing the latest update on their condition.\n\nFive of the wounded troops have already returned to duty, while two others are still recovering from their injuries, the official said.\n\n\"They are receiving excellent medical care and are well on their way to recovery,\" they said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump initially revealed Saturday morning, several hours after the operation had wrapped up, that \"a couple of guys were hit\" as US forces stormed Maduro's compound to apprehend Venezuela's now-former president and his wife, Cilia Flores.\n\nTrump later shared that all the injured service members were in \"good shape.\" He added that no US troops were killed, and no equipment was lost in this operation. A helicopter took a hit but remained operational.\n\n\"The fact that this extremely complex and grueling mission was successfully executed with so few injuries is a testament to the expertise of our joint warriors,\" the defense official said.\n\nIt's unclear what kind of injuries the troops sustained during the mission or how they were hurt. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, said on Monday that nearly 200 US personnel entered \"downtown Caracas\" as part of the operation.\n\nThe surprise US operation, called Absolute Resolve, followed months of extensive planning and rehearsal, including building a replica of Maduro's compound. On Saturday, Trump described the facility as a \"highly guarded\" building, \"like a fortress.\"\n\nLow-flying helicopters brough in apprehension teams, which included law enforcement officers and special operations forces, while dozens of other aircraft — from fighter jets and bombers to drones — cleared a path for them by striking Venezuela's air defenses.\n\nDan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters on Saturday that \"those in the air over Caracas last night were willing to give their lives for those on the ground and in the helicopters.\"\n\nAmerican forces stormed the compound under heavy fire. At some point during the operation, which began late Friday night and continued for several hours into Saturday morning, the troops were wounded. The US said everyone made it out though.\n\nDozens of Venezuelan and Cuban security personnel were killed during the US raid, according to the two militaries.",

    "description": "Many Greenlanders are interested in working with the US, but they all bristle at the idea of being bought or taken by force.",
    "fullText": "If Greenlanders weren't concerned by President Donald Trump's threats to annex the territory in his first term, many of them are now.\n\nIn the days since the United States' surprise raid into Venezuela, there's been a renewed focus on Trump's interest in the island, sparking fear among locals.\n\n\"I don't know what he's able to do. Most of me is trying to tell myself, 'Don't worry, everything's going to be fine,' but still I'm worried,\" Tupaarnaq Kreutzmann Kleist, a sheep farmer in South Greenland, told Business Insider's Sarah Andersen on Tuesday.\n\nCasper Frank Møller, CEO and cofounder of Greenland tourist company Raw Arctic, echoed Kleist's concerns, saying that he and many of his peers are worried about how the situation may affect their finances.\n\n\"We've made investments into developing our tourism aspects of our company, and it comes with risk now because of the geopolitical situation and the threats by Trump, so of course, yeah, we're all really worried,\" he told Business Insider on Tuesday.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider on Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Trump and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue Greenland, including \"utilizing the US Military.\"\n\nTrump's had his sights set on the Arctic island, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, since his first term in office. He has argued that Greenland's location makes it strategically important, as the melting of Arctic ice opens up new shipping routes and intensifies competition with Russia and China. The island is also rich in critical minerals and already hosts a key US military base, which American officials say is vital to missile defense and Arctic security.\n\nWhen Trump initially raised the topic of buying Greenland in 2019, Greenlandic influencer and engineer Qupanuk Olsen told Business Insider she and other locals thought it was a joke, and said she still didn't take it seriously when Trump resurfaced talks in late 2024.\n\nThat changed when Donald Trump Jr. visited Nuuk in January 2025. \"That's when we realized that Trump's words were no longer just words,\" Olsen said in June. \"They are real, and he means what he says.\" Business Insider wasn't able to reach Olsen this week for a follow-up.\n\nIn the wake of the raid on Venezuela, Møller said on Tuesday that Trump's threats to annex Greenland feel \"much more realistic that it will actually happen\" than when he spoke with Business Insider in January 2025.\n\nUS interest had at least one positive effect, Olsen said in June: It pushed Greenlanders to think more seriously about their place in the world and the need to speak for themselves.\n\n\"It was such a huge wake-up call for everyone in Greenland because suddenly we needed to have an opinion whether we still want to stay under Denmark, whether we should become independent, or whether we should become a state under the United States,\" she said. \"We certainly had options. So those options were helpful in the beginning for the independence movement.\"\n\nThat mindset may be shifting. Kleist said she's worried that \"we as the local indigenous Greenlandic people are slowly going against each other now,\" she told Business Insider on Tuesday. Some want to stand with America, others with Denmark, she said. Ultimately, though, the dream is for Greenland to become its own independent country, she added.\n\n\"We want Greenland to be the Greenlanders, and we're not for sale. We are not to be taken over,\" Møller said.\n\nNaaja Nathanielsen, Greenland's minister of natural resources, business, energy, justice, and gender equality, said in June that she sees much of the American administration's interest in Greenland as an opportunity for collaboration. But she said the way Trump is going about it is wrong.\n\n\"I think if we take the temperature down a bit and de-escalate the conflict level and the rhetoric, I think we can, in agreement with each other, find many paths forward that are mutually beneficial for both the US and for us,\" Nathanielsen said in June. \"But we don't appreciate being talked about as a commodity, as something you can buy or sell or acquire or take. That is, of course, offensive to all people.\"\n\nIn an email on Tuesday, Nathanielsen told Business Insider that she stands by what she said in June.\n\n\"The people of Greenland find the current situation unsettling, and it causes a great deal of anxiety,\" she wrote. \"We will continuously promote the idea of alliances and partnerships over colonialism. We have had our share of that.\"\n\nDenmark, Trump has argued, is not doing enough to safeguard Greenland. \"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security,\" Trump told a group of reporters on Air Force One on Sunday.\n\nThe same day, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen urged the US in a statement to \"stop the threats against a historically close ally.\" Frederiksen has previously rejected Trump's suggestions outright, telling him that Greenland is not for sale and that any idea of annexation is \"absurd.\"\n\nFrederiksen has warned that any US military action against Greenland would severely damage NATO unity, raising questions about whether the alliance could withstand such a conflict between allies.\n\nOn Tuesday, major European leaders, including those from France, Germany, the UK, Italy, Spain, Poland, and Denmark, released a joint statement defending Greenland. \"Greenland belongs to its people,\" the statement said. \"It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"",

    "description": "The Google cofounder has severed ties between California and several of his business entities, including his family office.",
    "fullText": "Billionaire Larry Page is peacing out of California.\n\nThe Google cofounder has cut ties between California and many of his assets that risked exposing him to a proposed new wealth tax in the state, meeting an end-of-2025 deadline, according to filings reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nPage's family office, Koop, was converted out of California in late December and incorporated in Delaware, per filings with both states. Page converted several other entities to Delaware, including Flu Lab LLC — a vehicle he has used to fund research on tackling influenza and lists its principal office address in Nevada — and another entity named One Aero, which has funded his flying car ventures and lists its principal office address in Florida.\n\nA filing was also made to convert Dynatomics, LLC from California to Delaware with a new principal address in Keller, Texas. Page launched Dynatomics, a new startup focused on applying AI to aircraft manufacturing, in 2023, Business Insider previously reported. A source close to Page said that the team, run by Chris Anderson, continues to work out of California.\n\nAnderson and representatives for Page's family office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe New York Times reported in December that Page had told people he was considering moving to Florida because of a proposed ballot measure that would tax the state's wealthiest residents. The proposal, if passed successfully, would mean that any California resident worth more than $1 billion would be taxed 5% of their assets.\n\nUnder California law, residency is determined by the nature of a person's ties to the state, with factors such as the time spent in the state and the maintenance of substantial business ties taken into account. If the ballot measure is approved in November, it would take effect retroactively for residents living in California as of January 1, 2026.\n\nA source close to Page said the Google cofounder had already left the state. Whether Page's move is temporary could not be learned.\n\nPage is ranked the second-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nBesides his family office and funding vehicles, Page converted out an LLC that Business Insider previously identified as being used to purchase islands in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, from California to Delaware, with a new address listed in Florida.\n\nA separate LLC Page used to purchase an Island in Fiji was also converted out to Delaware.\n\nPage's wife, the scientist Lucinda Southworth, founded a marine-conservation charity named Oceankind. Filings show that Oceankind converted out of California to Delaware in December.\n\nDelaware has become a popular state for businesses to incorporate due to its favorable tax structure, privacy, and its home to a court system specifically designed to handle corporate disputes. The state does not require LLCs to disclose the names and addresses of directors when incorporating, providing them with an extra layer of privacy.\n\nPrivacy is especially important to Page, whose family office is shrouded in a level of secrecy unparalleled by most and carefully managed by its CEO, Wayne Osborne.\n\nCristina Rosado, an attorney who handles many of Page and Southworth's assets, signed several of the California filings.\n\nPage incorporated three entities in Florida last year, as previously reported by The New York Times. A Koop LLC was incorporated in Florida in January 2025, per filings reviewed by Business Insider. It could not be confirmed if it belongs to Page.\n\nThe California billionaire tax proposal faced some opposition from leaders in venture capital and politics. In a post on X in December, venture capitalist Vinod Khosla said the proposed measure would mean California would lose its most important taxpayers and \"net off much worse.\"\n\n\"Long term damage unless legislature bans wealth taxes,\" he added. \"Easier to equalize taxes on work income and capital gains at the national level.\n\nMatt Mahan, Democratic mayor of San Jose, California, on Monday described the tax as \"a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy.\"\n\nWhite House AI czar David Sacks has criticized the proposal and said it will backfire. He has also said he believes Miami and Austin will overtake New York and San Francisco for finance and tech, respectively. He announced this month that his venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, had opened an office in Austin.\n\nLast month, celebrity lawyer Alex Spiro wrote a letter to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, warning that the proposed billionaire tax would \"trigger an exodus of capital and innovation from California,\" Business Insider previously reported.\n\nHave something to share?

    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

    "description": "It took creativity (and money), but now I can cook in my little kitchen.",
    "fullText": "Last year, one of my New Year's resolutions was to overhaul my apartment and turn it into a cleaner, more comfortable, more organized, and more efficient space. Knowing that a messy space can negatively impact your productivity and overall mental health, I reasoned that this would actually serve the purpose of making me a more efficient, peaceful person, so I took it seriously. One major issue was quickly apparent: My kitchen is tiny, which meant it was disorganized and more or less useless when it came to its primary function, which is to facilitate my cooking. It took some creativity (and money), but I figured out what to do—and now I'm learning to cook and bake better for one of this year's resolutions.\n\nMy kitchen is a little over three feet wide and five feet long. (I live in NYC, where this is the norm.) There is no counter space; all there is along one side is a sink and an oven. The first thing I had to do was manufacture counter space, which I did by adding cubed storage shelving. (I did this years ago, but only truly organized the cubes last year. We're getting to that.) It looks like this:\n\nThe main things I thought of, besides organizing the cubed storage, were how I could better utilize what space I did have, which is why anything and everything possible is now hanging vertically on under-cabinet wine glass racks, utensil holders, or a towel rack, plus hooks all over. What I'm most excited for is the impending delivery of this big peg board, which is going to allow me to hang more utensils and cookware on the wall.\n\nOther, smaller improvements became more obvious to me as I worked through organizing the big stuff. Once I cleared out and designated a suitable spot for my Nespresso, I figured out I needed a vertical, adhesive-backed holder for the pods, since there wasn't enough room in the cubes to hold them in their retail boxes. I finally bought a big ladder so I could actually use my cupboards. I then set about organizing the cupboards with acrylic risers, the same way I organized my perfume and makeup. For the area under the sink, I bought a pull-out shelf to give me easy access to cleaning materials. The boxes containing my various grains and oats were too unwieldy to keep in my cupboards, which led me to a rotating rice dispenser. It went on that way for a while, with me paying tribute to the Amazon gods every few days, but it was all because I had a bigger plan.\n\nYou may not want a giant peg board or need to hang all your spatulas upside-down. Maybe you have lots of drawers. That's cool. You still need a plan for organizing whatever you've got and a plan for figuring out what you, specifically, need.\n\nThroughout the organizing process, I kept a key principle in mind. It's called the Organizational Triangle and it's a set of three rules: Everything needs a place, similar items must be stored together, and for every new thing that comes in, one should go out. I ignored the last rule, for the most part, because what I was bringing in was meant to store what was already there better, but those first two were crucial. Prior to using the OT, not everything had a place. Some bowls and mugs lived in the sink. Not everything was stored together, either, which made it a pain to attempt to cook. By grouping similar items and designating each of them a spot, I could assess the volume of each category, get rid of what I didn't need, and better organize everything. By organizing smaller batches of things that would fit into one cube or on one hanging rack, I ended up organizing the whole thing, big-picture-style.\n\nOther cleaning and organizing techniques, like SIMPLE and Core 4, were also instrumental. Both of these advise that you need containers for your things. Again, this helps you assess actual volume and make sharper decluttering choices, but it also keeps everything neat. I got a little abstract in my interpretation, considering my hanging organizers \"containers,\" but also used boxes and the aforementioned grain dispenser to meet those requirements.",

    "fullText": "Anker launched a pair of \"2-in-1\" earbuds under its Soundcore brand at CES 2026, and it has a unique feature: They can be worn in two ways by adjusting the ear hooks. When you want active noise cancellation, you can wear it in-ear, and when you don't, you can adjust the hooks for an open-ear design. This quirky product is called the Soundcore Aerofit 2 Pro—and you can already buy it for $150, which includes a launch discount of $30.\n\nWhen it comes to CES announcements, I'm always wary of vaporware, aka products that are announced but never shipped. That's why I keep an eye out for products with a shorter launch window so you can actually get your hands on the things you're excited about. The Soundcore Aerofit 2 Pro is one of those products. As Anker itself admits on the product page, the Aerofit 2 Pro isn't for everyone. The biggest quirk of this product is its size. It's a lot bigger than most ANC earbuds, and the ear hooks go all the way around your ears, which isn't a fit that works for everyone. The charging case is also quite large, when compared with other ANC earbuds: It's 4.23 inches (11cm) wide, and it supports wireless charging.\n\nMost noise-cancelling headphones let you switch to a listening mode that allows ambient sounds via software, but the Aerofit 2 Pro lets you do this by physically twisting the earbuds. This adjustment seems quite seamless based on the demo video on the product page, but I haven't tested it in-person, so I'll reserve my judgment until I do. There are five levels of adjustment for the ear hooks, with levels 1 and 2 reserved for open-ear listening, and 4 and 5 for noise cancellation. Level 3 maintains your previous listening mode to prevent accidentally switching to a different mode.",

    "fullText": "My Canadian in-laws include a famous (I'm told) ice hockey star, and yet I've still spent more time engaging with hockey via the HBO Max streaming sensation Heated Rivalry than from the stands of any actual court or rink or whatever it is you call the place where people pass around their pucks. Not that I know any more about the game after watching, because frankly, that's not why we're here, nor is that what the buzz is all about.\n\nHeated Rivalry is all about the very horny relationship between Japanese-Canadian team captain Shane (Hudson Williams) and Ilya (Connor Storrie), a headstrong Russian playing for a different team (not a euphemism). Even as their public relationship remains contentious over a period of years, the two develop a casual (at least at first) sexual relationship that grows increasingly sweaty and romantic, ice notwithstanding. Not to be outdone, the show also traces the complicated relationship between an American team captain and a smoothie barista.\n\nIn the increasingly backward-looking world of streamer programming, Heated Rivalry managed to draw eyes and a renewal by being the horniest, gayest show out there. Once you've binged it, you can follow up with one of these steamy streamalikes.\n\nIt's a short flight from horny gay ice hockey in Canada to horny gay figure skating in Japan and, yet, Yuri on Ice has just been sitting there waiting to be rediscovered. One of the best-reviewed anime of the last decade or so, the show finds defeated 23-year-old skater Yuri Katsuki returning to his hometown in Kyushu before an impromptu routine goes viral and draws the attention of Victor, a former champ who hopes to coach Yuki to revive his own career. The developing relationship is complex and compellingly twisty, and the animation is gorgeous; the show also gets a lot of credit for accuracy from both figure skaters...and pole dancers. Stream Yuri on Ice on Hulu and Crunchyroll.\n\nA standout of its year that, of course, got cancelled, the show expands on the 1992 film of the same name, diving further into the real-life story of the Rockford Peaches, women's professional baseball team in 1943. Abbi Jacobson, Chanté Adams, and D'Arcy Carden star as Carson, Max, and Greta, all three characters queer, either comfortably or in a process of exploration. Lest that sounds like some kind of ultra-woke revisionism, the show, while highly fictionalized, approaches the LGBTQ+ makeup of the Peaches far more accurately than did the earlier movie (despite including both Rosie O'Donnell and Madonna among its cast). Stream A League of Their Own on Prime Video.\n\nSex, desire, and queer longing in the high-pressure world of competitive sports? Sounds like a theme. This Spanish-language show involves young athletes at the Pirineos Center of High Performance (better them than me), battling to be the best in their respective sports and, with a bit of luck, earning sponsorship deals with the global fashion brand of the title. The central, steamy, but secretive relationship is between Roque Pérez (Agustín Della Corte) and Sebas Senghor (Juan Perale)—think Heated Rivalry, but in Spanish and with rugby. Stream Olympo on Netflix.\n\nLena Waithe created this comedy following Hattie, an aspiring screenwriter and queer Black woman navigating life and work in LA with her straight besties, Marie (Christina Elmore) and Nia (Gabrielle Graham). The tone is loose and funny, involving friends who spend as much time trash-talking as they do working, but there's still a sense of young people in a hyper-competitive industry fighting to make it. Stream Twenties on Paramount+ and BET+.\n\nTonally, this time-jumping survival drama is a total mismatch, but I'm throwing it in the mix for its blend of sports and queer characters, especially leads Taissa (Jasmin Savoy Brown) and Van (Liv Hewson). The show is about a group of teenage girls becoming stranded in the wilderness on the way to a soccer match in 1996 and doing terrible things to survive—the extent of which we only learn about via flashbacks from the present, where the events of those 19 months continue to have an impact. There are ambiguous teases of the supernatural, and plenty of horror unfolds in a past that we're still seeing fleshed out going into the fourth and final season. The show rather cynically posits that there's a huge difference between the version of the past we talk about and the one that really happened. Stream Yellowjackets on Paramount+ and Netflix (for the first two seasons).\n\nSteamy soap Young Royals follows Wilhelm (Edvin Ryding), the fictional prince of Sweden, as he embarks on a romance with another student, Simon Eriksson (Omar Rudberg), at their elite boarding school—it's not hockey, but there's no shortage of intense competition among these attractive young queers and their classmates. While possessed of all the addictive qualities of the teen drama genre, Young Royals takes itself a bit more seriously than some, and feels remarkably fresh in its commitment to casting age-appropriate actors in all the key roles. Stream Young Royals on Netflix.\n\nA fun comedy-drama set during the 1980s, GLOW’s ensemble is lead by Alison Brie as Ruth Wilder, a serious yet very out-of-work actor who signs on with Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling, a fictionalized version of the real sports organization of the same name. The show’s heightened drama, period detail, and willingness to be a little silly were highlights, as were the multiple queer characters: the growing relationship between Yolanda (Shakira Barrera) and Arthie (Sunita Mani) is a prominent focus; menwhile, Bash, the wrestling producer, explores his own sexuality amid the Reagan-era AIDS crisis. Stream GLOW on Netflix.\n\nLet's say that you're into Heated Rivalry for the hockey. Which: sure. To each their own. If so, you could do a lot worse than this (largely standalone) Letterkenny spin-off, starring and created by Jared Keeso, who also plays the title character. The veteran player moves to the small-ish city of Sudbury, Ontario after making a bet that he can save the struggling Sudbury Bulldogs. The comedy is simultaneously raunchy and sweet (think Ted Lasso), with some solid queer rep among some of the secondary characters. More to the point, perhaps, is the involvement of executive producer and frequent director Jacob Tierney, who just happens to have also created Heated Rivalry. Stream Shoresy on Hulu.\n\nComedian Benito Skinner plays himself, kinda, in this buzzy comedy that sees a former high school jock facing his freshman year in college while desperately trying to convince himself and everyone else that he's as straight as they come (relatable, except for the jock part). Much of the appeal is in its deft blending of tones: It's a frequently raunchy college comedy, and simultaneously a sweet coming-of-age story about accepting yourself without worrying about what everyone else thinks. The cast includes Adam DiMarco (The White Lotus) and Rish Shah (Ms. Marvel) and, just like Heated Rivalry, it's a streaming show with queer leads that's actually been renewed. Stream Overcompensating on Prime Video.\n\nAnother BL anime (as in \"Boy's Love,\" a significant sub-genre), Given follows four adults who come together to form the titular rock band, with music connecting the characters while also helping them to navigate past trauma. The manga on which the show is based interweaves several gay storylines, but the anime puts a focus on the growing relationship between Ritsuka and Mafuyu, whose guitarist boyfriend died by suicide. In common with Heated Rivalry, it's about navigating a complicated relationship in a high-pressure environment. Stream Given on Crunchyroll or buy it from Prime Video.\n\nThere were a few impressive LGBTQ+ shows this past season, with Boots generating buzz and predating both Pluribus and Heated Rivalry by just about a month. Alas, while those two survived the (more than) annual streaming purge, Boots didn't make it out of camp. Based on a memoir from Greg Cope White, the Netflix series stars Miles Heizer as Cameron Cope, a closeted gay teen who follows his bestie into the Army in the era before \"Don't ask, don't tell,\" and well before serving in the open was a possibility. Stream Boots on Netflix.\n\nThe affirming coming-of-age/queer teen love story that we all kinda need right about now, Heartstopper is more about kisses and significant glances than it is about the hot, illicit sex of Heated Rivalry—and do with that what you will. While it never soft-peddles the dangers of homophobia, it likewise doesn’t wallow in tragedy. Kit Connor and Joe Locke deliver sensitive (and often very funny) performances in a show that’s nearly all smiles without feeling treacly. Stream Heartstopper on Netflix.",

    "title": "This Is the Best Free Mac Cleanup Tool I've Found",
    "description": "Forget overpriced cleaner apps—Mole does it all for free.",
    "fullText": "There are a lot of apps on the market that claim to \"clean up\" your Mac—for a price. Some offer subscriptions, some cost a lot up front, but for the most part, they offer the same few features—wiping things like caches and logs, completely uninstalling apps, and monitoring system health. These apps all tend to be a little on the bloated side, with a lot of animations and graphics.\n\nThe free, open source, Terminal-based Mole is the opposite of those applications. Running entirely from the command line, Mole couldn't possibly look less flashy, but it combines a number of different tools that can free up hard drive space on your Mac while also keeping things running smoothly.\n\nTo get started, you'll need to install Mole. The simplest way to do this is by using Homebrew, which any Mac user interested in a Terminal-based application should probably do anyway. There is, alternatively, a script you can use to install Mole on the download page.\n\nTo use the application, just type \"mole\" in the Terminal and hit enter—you'll be presented with the five main tools offered: Clean, Uninstall, Optimize, Analyze, and Status. (You can, alternatively, type \"mole\" followed by the tool you want to use—more on that later.)\n\nThe first, Clean, scans your hard drive for caches and temporary files, then deletes them. The application explains what it's doing every step of the way, and you can always do a dry run using the command mole clean --dry-run if you'd like to see an overview before affecting any system files.\n\nThe second tool, Uninstall, presents you with a list of applications installed on your computer and lets you know how much storage space they're using. You can select as many applications as you want with the spacebar, then hit enter in order to completely remove them. This doesn't just uninstall the application itself—it also removes all associated files, including settings.\n\nThe third tool, Optimize, performs a number of routine maintenance tasks such as flushing the DNS cache, optimizing databases, and refreshing the Finder. I find this useful when my Mac is hanging for seemingly no reason.\n\nThe fourth tool, Analyze, lets you see which folders are taking up the most space on your hard drive—useful if you're trying to free up disk space on your Mac. You'll see a list of folders alongside how much space they're taking up. Open a folder to see a breakdown of the folders and files inside it. I was able to find a number of large files using this tool, some of which I didn't need anymore.\n\nThe final tool, Status, is a simple dashboard with stats including CPU, memory, and hard drive usage alongside an animated ascii-art cat. It's simple.\n\nIt's all very straight forward to use, and there are generally instructions on the screen telling you what to do next. One thing I do want to point out is that you can run most of these tools directly from the Terminal, without the initial menu. You can, for example, type mole clean to run the cleaner or mole status to open the dashboard. You can",

    "title": "CES 2026: I Tried a Gaming Headset That Can Read Your Mind",
    "description": "Lock in before you drop in.",
    "fullText": "Before this CES, I thought gaming headsets had gotten about as complex as they ever would. How many improvements can you possibly make on speakers and microphones? Well, forget all that. Apparently, the future of gaming headsets is mind reading.\n\nIn a private demo with a colleague from IGN, I tested out a collaboration between HP's HyperX gaming brand and brain-computer interface company Neurable. Neurable's been at CES before, but most of its work has been in the defense and enterprise sectors. The brand is specifically aimed at helping you nail down your focus, and now, Neurable thinks it can use that to help gamers.\n\nBefore trying on the Neurable x HyperX headset, I did a quick run-through in a target shooting game, where I shot down 30 targets with a 547ms response time. Then, I was guided through a focus program called Prime. This showed a cloud of dots on the screen, and I was told to do whatever I needed to do to focus up. I decided to stare into the distance and count, and in about 90 seconds, the dots had shrunken down into a small orb and I was \"primed.\" Neurable also suggested focusing techniques like repeating a word in your head over and over, or following one of the dots as it moved about the screen, but these didn't work for me.\n\nThen, I did the shooting test again. Theoretically, I should have been better, but I actually scored slightly worse this time—a 559ms response time. Still, that response time isn't terrible, and your mileage may vary. I might have already been locked in before priming. In contrast, my colleague actually reduced her response time by about 40ms after priming. If all of that optimization sounds really nitty-gritty, it is. This is aimed at esports players and streamers, where every millisecond counts.\n\nThat's probably where the headset's coolest feature comes in for me. Alongside Prime, Neurable and HyperX are also working on an overlay plugin for streamers that can show their focus levels on screen. You can display this as a speedometer, or as that cloud of dots, or even as a progress bar that shows whether you're \"on tilt\" or not. It should make for some pretty fun interactions with viewers, and play well with existing plug-ins, like eye trackers that show where a streamer is looking.\n\nPlus, my slightly worse response time after priming wasn't totally useless. Neurable said the headset could be used to help you \"practice choking,\" where you psych yourself up shortly after locking in and end up worse off. I thought that sounded like marketing spin, but my colleague, a high-level raider in World of Warcraft, said it would have real use for her.\n\nIt's still just a concept for now, but it's exciting to see this kind of tech getting ready to hit the mass market. What also sets Neurable apart is how portable it is. Unlike other brain-computer interfaces, this just looks like a normal headset, and all the contacts are just stored in the ear cups. There's no need for a giant helmet with discs and wires attached to it, thanks to Neurable's expertise in AI. The company says that using such a compact form factor does result in getting a small amount of data (and a lot of junk data, at that), but thanks to an on-device AI model, it's easily able to detect trends in your focus and translate them into something usable.\n\nThat seemed to be true in my demo, which at the end of the day, kind of felt like a guided meditation with real-time feedback. You could use this for more than gaming, but it's a clever use case for digital mind-reading, and the streaming plugins really take the cake, helping solidify the concept into a clear product with a concrete goal and target audience.\n\nIt'll take a while for the gaming version of Neurable's tech to be ready, although the company said it hopes to get it out this year. In the meantime, you can buy an ultra-luxury headset with Neurable's mind-reading built in, although it's currently on pre-order and will set you back $500. It also won't come with Prime or that streaming plugin, although because those are based in software, that could change in the future.",

    "title": "CES 2026: XREAL's New Gaming Glasses Put a Huge, Fast Gaming Monitor Right on Your Face",
    "description": "Asus and XREAL are working together to make the big screen better for gaming, and smaller than ever before.",
    "fullText": "I've been a fan of XREAL for a while, but outside of people who are really into AR, it's still a lesser-known company. Lifehacker has given XREAL's glasses stellar reviews before, but in the company's new collaboration with Asus, it's aiming to expand its market. The new ROG XREAL R1 AR glasses are the first XREAL glasses aimed specifically at gaming (though its other models aren't exactly bad for gaming), and they basically put the best gaming monitor you could ever want right in front of your face.\n\nYou wear these like a normal pair of sunglasses, and you get a massive 171-inch virtual TV floating in a black void right in front of you. It's an OLED, so there are crisp colors and high contrast, and the resolution is a respectable 1080p. Most importantly, the glasses max out at a 240Hz refresh rate, meaning they can display up to 240 frames per second.\n\nTaken all together, that's better than pretty much all of the full-size desktop monitors I have at home, but these are portable. They're barely heavier than my reading glasses, too, and you can set your virtual screen to either be anchored in one spot (meaning it won't follow your head) or stay in front of your eyes at all times. I prefer the former, since it shakes around less.\n\nI also didn't get any of the usual problems I have with AR or VR, like light bleed or fuzzy graphics. Aside from the black void, this really did feel like looking at a real-life screen. And you don't even have to use the full 171 inches, if you prefer something smaller.\n\nAside from the glasses, Asus is also shipping these with a dock, to help you better use them with your various devices. It has two HDMI ports and one DisplayPort connection, so you can have up to three devices ready to go at one time. It's probably the most realistic way to simulate gaming on a movie theater screen, and it's only set to improve down the line. Asus told me these glasses will eventually support XREAL's 2D-to-3D conversion tech, which just came out on the new XREAL 1S glasses and automatically converts any image to 3D. The effect uses AI to determine how to split the image between your eyes, but it was so convincing to me when I tried it with Mario Kart World that it felt like it was officially developed by Nintendo.\n\nAnd on that end, I have confirmation from XREAL that the ROG XREAL R1 glasses are compatible with the XREAL Neo mobile dock and battery pack. This is much more compact than the dock that comes with the headset, and, if you plug the glasses and the Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 into it at the same time, it will allow you to play your Nintendo console in AR. Even Asus' dock can't do that without another Switch dock acting as an intermediary first. Plus, this will charge whatever device you're playing at the same time.\n\nThe ROG XREAL R1 AR glasses will release later this year, although pricing isn't available quite yet. They're expected to release in the first half of this year.",

It is structural - the future of French club football is at stake.\"\n\nIn November, Strasbourg president Marc Keller argued that owners BlueCo have been positive for the club, having invested more than £100m in the summer transfer window, with multi-club ownership now a common reality in modern football. He pointed to investment in the stadium, women's team and academy.\n\nKeller and new sporting director David Weir, who joined the French side after leaving Brighton in the summer, oversaw O'Neil's appointment.",

I think he deserves that respect.\n\n\"I wanted to run it by him and he echoed my thoughts. When you're an employee of the club, it's your job to do your best for Manchester United. It is something I try and live and believe every day, so it was comforting for me for him to say that.\"",

That being said, you'll need to extract with the Magnetron and Flow Controller items once you find them, so it's probably best to bring in an augment that has a safe pocket or two to ensure you don't accidentally lose these precious items if you find them during your raid.",

For Harry Potter fans, Hogwarts Legacy is one of the best RPGs on the market, and it's largely based on lore from the Wizarding World. So, while it's difficult to get that same exact experience if you're looking to be in the world of Harry Potter, you can find similar gameplay elements and deep lore-rich stories in other games.\nBelow, we'll be listing 17 games that feature some sort of similarity to Hogwarts Legacy. That similarity could come in the form of one specific gameplay feature or an all-encompassing experience that gives you the same thrills as you had when walking the halls of Hogwarts.",
    "fullText": "on January 6, 2026 at 12:01PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nWhether Hogwarts Legacy was another RPG in your backlog of games or your first foray into video games, there are plenty of games like it that you can play once you've rolled the credits on WB Games' magical open-world title. For Harry Potter fans, Hogwarts Legacy is one of the best RPGs on the market, and it's largely based on lore from the Wizarding World. So, while it's difficult to get that same exact experience if you're looking to be in the world of Harry Potter, you can find similar gameplay elements and deep lore-rich stories in other games.\n\nBelow, we'll be listing 17 games that feature some sort of similarity to Hogwarts Legacy. That similarity could come in the form of one specific gameplay feature or an all-encompassing experience that gives you the same thrills as you had when walking the halls of Hogwarts. If you haven't had a chance to pick up Hogwarts Legacy yet, it is available on Nintendo Switch 2.\n\nHogwarts Legacy was embroiled in controversy due to transphobic remarks from Harry Potter author JK Rowling. Although she was not personally involved with its development, she stands to profit from its success. For more, read our in-depth article on how Rowling's comments have impacted the trans community.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was one of the more important RPGs ever made due to its revolutionary open world map and quest design, two core pillars of Hogwarts Legacy. While you can still play the original, Oblivion Remastered is a better product in almost every single way. The 2006 masterpiece has been completely remastered, featuring overhauled graphics, character models, dialogue, and mechanics. The core game is still intact, though, as you start your adventure on an epic quest to uncover the mystery of why your emperor was murdered.\n\nAlong the way, you'll encounter five distinct guilds, each with its own questlines, several sprawling cities teeming with life, and an open world that features dozens of unique locations. Also, if you're a fan of the magical combat in Hogwarts Legacy, Oblivion Remastered lets you become a full-blown mage who can use a variety of different magic attacks. It doesn't officially support them, but a collection of Oblivion Remastered mods have also begun to pop up that can further improve the experience.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nImmortals Fenyx Rising is an action-adventure game in the mold of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild that places a large emphasis on combat, but still has many qualities that appeal to Hogwarts Legacy fans. You'll get to explore the world right from the start of the game, and when you're not fighting enemies, you can solve a number of challenging puzzles that lead to rewards or other areas within the world. As for combat, you'll get to challenge mythological beasts such as Medusa as well as a plethora of other smaller enemies. The combat in Immortals Fenyx Rising is quite faster than in Hogwarts Legacy, but it's easy to pick up once you understand the controls.\n\nIf the lore and story were your favorite parts about Hogwarts Legacy, then why not hop over to another beloved pop culture franchise? Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is an original story in the Star Wars universe that takes place between the events of the prequel trilogy and the new trilogy movies. It's a sequel to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, but you don't need to play that game to understand what's happening in Survivor.\n\nThe game continues to follow protagonist Cal Kestis as he attempts to lead a rebellion against the Empire with a band of outlaws. Survivor sees you visit several planets that are somewhat open world and all have different enemies to face, puzzles to solve, and collectibles to find. As you progress, you'll unlock more attack types, including additional Force abilities and lightsaber forms. The combat in Survivor can be fairly difficult, especially against the late-game bosses, but you have plenty of tools at your disposal to take down enemies. For newer video game players, you can simply set the difficulty level to its lowest setting and take in one of the best Star Wars tales told in recent memory.\n\nLA Noire might not be the first game you think of when you think of Hogwarts Legacy. However, the two games have \n\nIf you enjoyed the outskirt areas of Hogwarts Legacy that extended beyond the castle grounds, then Ghost of Tsushima might be right up your alley. This open-world RPG is set in 13th-century Japan during the Mongol invasion and features extremely detailed and beautiful landscapes outside of the war-torn towns and fields. Ghost of Tsushima sees you play as a samurai who's trying to navigate the invasion and protect their island from the Mongols. When you're not actively doing story missions, you can explore a huge world filled with real-life locations that are still standing in Japan today. You'll come across your fair share of enemies while exploring, but the combat in Ghosts of Tsushima is beginner-friendly while still being difficult to master as you unlock more weapons and skills. A sequel, Ghost of Yotei, is on the way in 2025.\n\nThe Horizon series features perhaps the closest games to Hogwarts Legacy. The first game in the series is Horizon Zero Dawn, but you can also play its sequel, Horizon Forbidden West, for an equally thrilling adventure. We recommend playing Zero Dawn first, though, as there's so much lore you need to understand before you can fully appreciate Forbidden West.\n\nIn Horizon Zero Dawn, you play as Aloy, an orphan born in the midst of a post-apocalyptic period in an alternate version of the United States in the 31st century. In this version of the US, man-made machines have taken over the planet, and tribes of hunter-gatherers and warriors try to survive without antagonizing them. Throughout Zero Dawn, you'll uncover the origins of Aloy's story, which is deeply entangled with how this future came to be and what happened to the humans before the machines took over. It's an epic adventure with a huge open world, combat centered around a bow and arrow, and plenty of secrets to discover.\n\nThe Dragon Age franchise is one that Hogwarts Legacy fans should find enjoyable. They're RPGs with an emphasis on narrative elements and exploration through a large, open world. There's also plenty of magic at play, both in combat and with basic mechanics. In The Veilguard, you play as Rook, who's tasked with stopping a pair of corrupt gods who have escaped their imprisonment. At the beginning of the game, you'll be by yourself, but over time, you can recruit a number of companions to join your party and fight alongside you for the duration of the adventure. Magic, an open world, and a mysterious story all make Dragon Age: The Veilguard an enticing option for any Hogwarts fan. You also don't have to play any of the original Dragon Age games to understand the story, so feel free to hop right in regardless of your experience.\n\nSpeaking of a franchise with some deep lore, the Marvel universe is a natural stepping stone for any Hogwarts Legacy player to dive into. While some fantastic Marvel games have been released in the past several years, Spider-Man was the game that marked Marvel's revival in the video game industry. This is an original story for the webbed hero that follows Peter Parker trying to navigate a day job while also being a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. The story starts off relatively slow, but develops into a thriller with all sorts of twists and turns.\n\nThe setting for Marvel's Spider-Man is an open-world New York City, and swinging through its skyscrapers or Central Park is one of the best feelings you can experience in a video game. The swinging mechanics along with the Arkham-style combat are thoroughly crisp, leading you to feel like you really are Spider-Man.\n\nIf puzzles were one of your favorite parts of Hogwarts Legacy, but you still want some exploration, then look no further than The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Breath of the Wild is one of the most celebrated video games of all time, combining a staggeringly massive open world with fantastic puzzles that actually require you to use different parts of your console to solve. Some puzzles can simply be solved using the joysticks on your Switch, while others use the console's gyro controls and both Joy-Cons. The puzzles can be surprisingly difficult to get through, but they might not even be the hardest part of the game.\n\nInstead, the combat and gear degradation systems in Breath of the Wild will likely have you more challenged than the puzzles. Combat can be difficult if you run into a boss or enemy that outlevels you, but even easy fights have the potential to turn difficult if your favorite sword breaks from too much use. While all of this sounds overly challenging, Breath of the Wild allows you to play at your own pace, and players of all skill levels can pick it up and immediately enjoy what it has to offer. An enhanced Switch 2 Edition of Breath of the Wild and its excellent sequel, Tears of the Kingdom, are out now and boast some very nice upgrades.\n\nNow, your first thought when you see a game like Baldur's Gate 3 might be that you're not a fan of turn-based combat. After all, if you liked Hogwarts Legacy, going from fast-paced wand fights to slow, turn-based moves in every encounter could be jarring. However, if you can get past the shift to turn-based combat and really sink your teeth into Baldur's Gate 3, you'll discover why it's considered one of the best RPGs ever made.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 is an epic tale of your character, who can either be a preset character or completely your design, trying to stop an alien force from taking over an entire continent's minds. The game isn't necessarily open world, as it features distinct zones that are a part of the different story acts, but the zones themselves are very large. Within these zones, you'll be able to pick up new party members, who you can completely control, go on winding side quests that feel like their own mini-story, and explore the beautiful and dangerous landscapes that make up each one of the maps. Baldur's Gate 3 also features cross-play and is fully co-op, so you can partake in the adventure with a friend or two.\n\nThe Assassin's Creed franchise is somewhat divisive, as many fans seem to either love or hate the different styles of games in the series. If you were to pick one to play to scratch your Hogwarts Legacy itch, though, make it Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Set in 400 BC Greece, Odyssey sees you take control of either a male or female protagonist who comes from humble beginnings. However, over the course of the game, you'll take part in a war between Athens and Sparta, command a ship across high seas, and explore perhaps the biggest open-world map on this list. The story in Odyssey has a few different branches that all clash by the end of the 50-hour-plus campaign, and it's one of the most memorable in the Assassin's Creed franchise. Hogwarts Legacy fans should find the combat easy to pick up, and exploration on a much larger scale than they find in the Wizarding World.\n\nFable III is one of the few games on this list that's somewhat difficult to play in 2025. However, if you're subscribed to Game Pass, then you shouldn't have any trouble on Xbox or PC. Fable III is the most recent game in the Fable series, but the next entry, currently known simply as Fable, is coming sometime in 2026. The Fable series is widely beloved in the gaming community thanks to the charm of its characters and gameplay. Fable III specifically sees you embark on a quest to take down an unruly leader and manage the kingdom for the people of your country.\n\nWhile the story in Fable III isn't especially long, it does offer you a plethora of choices to make that drastically impact how the narrative plays out. During your adventure in the main story, you'll come across a slew of combat engagements, which play out in real time and feature melee, ranged, and magic attacks. The combat can be a little clunky in Fable III, but the world and characters will keep you enthralled throughout the entire game.\n\nIf we're recommending games like Hogwarts Legacy, let's go with one of the only other Wizarding World titles on the market that's easily playable in 2025. Lego Harry Potter: Years 1-4 allows you to play through the first four years of the Harry Potter series as Harry himself. You'll get to explore a slimmed-down version of Hogwarts Castle and meet the cast of characters that you know and love. The game doesn't play out exactly like the movies or books, so there will be some different events that take place. Of course, you'll still get to partake in the classic Harry Potter events, such as playing Quidditch, sneaking around after dark, and even battling the Basilisk. Given the Lego nature of these games, they're meant to appeal to a more casual gaming audience, but any Harry Potter fan should find something to enjoy in Years 1-4.\n\nLife is Strange is strictly a game for Hogwarts Legacy players who value the story above anything else. Life is Strange doesn't feature any sort of combat or an open-world map to explore. Instead, the game takes place over a series of episodes that follow Max Caulfield, a high school senior who discovers that she can rewind time. Using this ability, Max tries to save her best friend, but altering the past can come with severe consequences. Your job is to find a way to navigate the pitfalls of time travel to try and get as happy an ending as possible. The story is gripping throughout every episode of Life is Strange, and there is some puzzle-solving along the way.\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the most well-reviewed games ever and easily a top 10 RPG of all time. If the lore and world of Hogwarts Legacy are something that appeals to you, there's arguably no better game to turn to than The Witcher 3. Don't be intimidated by the \"3\" in the title, as it helps to know the lore of the first two games, but it's not imperative whatsoever.\n\nThe Witcher 3 sees you take control of Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter who possesses unnatural abilities and strengths. Geralt begins the game on the hunt for his adopted daughter, Ciri, as he's having dreams of an undead army called \"The Wild Hunt\" coming for him and Ciri. While this is the premise of the game, The Witcher 3 is so much more than its initial plotline. The game takes you across an incredibly detailed and large open world where quests and new locations are waiting around every corner. The Witcher 3 even features its own card-based minigame, Gwent, which is now a full-fledged game in its own right.\n\nThe Tomb Raider reboot in 2013 kicked off one of the best gaming trilogies of the modern era. Consisting of Tomb Raider, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider, these games are extremely well-done and provide you with a very similar experience to that of Hogwarts Legacy. You play as Lara Croft, a world explorer who comes from a wealthy family but finds herself constantly embroiled in some controversies with rival explorers. The Tomb Raider games offer fast-paced and stealthy combat, where you can use a variety of weapons, but you'll also be tasked with solving puzzles, or \"tombs,\" as you progress through the story. With a solid mix of combat, storytelling, and puzzles, you should find yourself right at home as a Hogwarts Legacy fan.\n\nIf you want to step into another established franchise with a cast of iconic characters and villains, then look no further than the Batman Arkham trilogy. Consisting of Batman Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight, these games revolutionized an entire generation of action-adventure and RPG titles with their \"Arkham-style\" combat. Naturally, you play as Batman in these games, and each title offers a new story for the Caped Crusader. The stories often revolve around the villains of the game, and the second and third titles allow you to explore an open-world Gotham City. While there's crime around every corner in Gotham, there are also puzzles you can solve that are doled out by none other than The Riddler. There's a slice of gameplay for all Hogwarts Legacy fans, but the Arkham games lean more on the side of combat than puzzles.",

    "description": ": Workers face new mental health pressures as they shift from doing tasks to babysitting agentic AI",
    "fullText": "A report on occupational health warns that AI adoption may paradoxically increase workplace burdens rather than reduce them. As AI automates routine tasks, workers will shoulder new responsibilities: overseeing AI systems, catching their errors, and managing the resulting complexity – potentially triggering mental health pressures.\n\nResearchers from Imperial College London and Microsoft argue the real impact won't be mass job replacement, but a fundamental shift in work demands. Human roles will evolve from performing tasks to stewarding AI agents across workflows, including briefing them, reviewing outputs, and correcting errors.\n\n\"As AI absorbs routine tasks, human roles may shift toward stewardship, problem-solving, or emotional labor, all with their own psychological demands,\" said Dr Lara Shemtob, who led the research published in the Society of Occupational Medicine's (SOM) journal Occupational Medicine.\n\nThis effectively transforms workers into managers of AI systems – a role not everyone is suited for. The report warns AI may \"paradoxically increase the knowledge worker's burden of handling complex tasks while simultaneously exerting downward pressure on compensation.\" This means more responsibility and less pay, because AI supposedly makes work \"easier.\"\n\nAll of this could introduce novel occupational hazards, some familiar in form but different in scale and complexity, raising stress levels.\n\nEvidence already supports this concern. A 2024 study found AI coding tools actually slowed developers down due to time spent checking and correcting AI-generated errors. As AI systems become more autonomous, problems like \"hallucinations\" (false or inaccurate outputs) may escalate and become harder to detect.\n\nUntil now, much of the debate over AI has centred on the extent to which it will (or maybe won't) replace people's jobs.\n\nThe report urges quantifying AI supervision demands and building them into job descriptions to avoid hidden workloads that negate automation benefits.\n\nResearchers don't yet know the exact impact on human employees from having to work more closely with AI, the report concludes, but they say occupational health should be part of the dialog and analysis of how AI changes expectations of workers.\n\nWhether this scenario materializes remains uncertain. Recent reports show companies have invested tens of billions in generative AI with little return, and many projects fail due to underestimated deployment complexity.\n\nThe question isn't just how AI will change work, it's whether widespread adoption will happen at all. ®",

This community has taken it upon themselves to create thousands of mods for Ark, and some of these improve the game in ways that fans would have never expected. From adding entirely new maps to creating more dangerous and unique dinosaurs to making your life easier with quality-of-life changes, the best Ark mods can fundamentally alter how you play the game.\n\nDown below, you’ll find the top mods that Ark has to offer. These are all searchable and downloadable via the game's Steam Workshop section. The modding community for Ark began on Steam and never migrated over to Nexus Mods, which is a shift from how many other survival games handle mods. However, with the mods being directly on Steam, this should make it simpler for you to download your favorite mods and immediately boot them up in Ark.\n\nStructures Plus is a gigantic mod that's completely centered around building in Ark. A bulk of the mod focuses on quality of life fixes and changes for building mode to make your life much easier. However, the best part about Structures Plus is the ability to snap your structures into place, so there's no more guessing where they might fit. You'll also see new materials included with the mod to spice up base life and give you more objects to build and play around with.\n\nOne of the more tedious aspects of Ark is having to travel everywhere. While you do get access to dinosaurs, both on the ground and in the air, being able to quickly travel somewhere is a benefit many Ark players wish they had. Well, it's no longer a wish with the Awesome Teleporters mod. This mod adds three new items into the game, and one of them is a teleporter that you can place anywhere on the map in whatever quantity you want. You can then quickly teleport to the locations you've placed them at. The mod also adds another teleport that transports you to a public teleporter on the map and a Dino Tracker, which allows you to teleport directly to a dino you're currently tracking.\n\nThere are very few worse things than dying in Ark, as you usually tend to lose whatever you had in your inventory. However, with the Death Recovery Mod, that won't happen ever again. The mod adds a personal gravestone to a set location of your choosing. If you die, you can return to this gravestone to retrieve any items that you lost upon death. You can basically place this gravestone down near your bed or respawn point so that when you die, you'll immediately be able to get your items and go on like nothing happened.\n\nWhile capturing all sorts of different dinosaurs and seeing them roam out in the wilderness is one of the best parts about Ark, it can also make dinosaur management a real hassle. Fortunately, with the Dino Storage v2 mod, you can safely and quickly store your captured dinosaurs in a safe place. This mod is basically like the PC system in Pokémon or a personal chest in Minecraft. Once you capture a dinosaur, you can choose to store it in the Dino Storage box until you're ready to take it back out. This allows you to easily track the dinosaurs you've caught and saves a ton of space on your part of the island in Ark.\n\nThe Upgrade Station mod allows you to fully improve the quality of any item in Ark. You can upgrade your gear, weapons, and tools from their most basic form all the way to the highest level possible (Ascendant). You can even upgrade the TEK armor set and items that have been modded into Ark. This means both your vanilla and modded weapons and armor can be upgraded using the new Upgrade Station that you can easily place at your base. You're even able to quickly salvage items at the station, giving you more resources to upgrade your gear.\n\nA tedious, but necessary, part of the progression in Ark is dealing with Engrams. You need them to access more advanced content throughout the game, but working through the system can be overwhelming and time-consuming. Luckily, the Auto Engrams mod aims to make the system more automatic and less taxing on the player. The mod automatically unlocks Engrams every time you level up and ignores the point restrictions on Engrams. This means you'll be able to take advantage of new Engrams without having to manually unlock them yourself.\n\nHunting normal dinosaurs is always an adrenaline rush in Ark, but what if there were a way to up the ante? The Improved Dinos mod adds rarer dinos into the game and gives them the ability to roam across a vast area, so there's some legwork when it comes to hunting them. If you manage to kill one of these rare dinosaurs, you're guaranteed to receive some rare blueprints that otherwise would have taken you hours to get from hunting other dinos across the island. The mod adds three dinos, with each one having unique traits: Raptor Elite, Alpha Dilo, and Obsidian Carno. You can read about their traits on the mod's Steam Workshop page.\n\nPrimal Fears is one of the biggest mods to come to Ark, and it adds hours of specifically-designed PvE content to the game. The mod adds different tameable tiers for every dinosaur in the game, as well as boss dinos that are incredibly difficult to kill. Each tameable tier of a dinosaur makes it more challenging to capture, and the tiers come with different challenges you'll have to overcome. In addition to all of that, Primal Fears also places brand new items into the game that aid players in capturing or killing the new dinosaurs. You can see more about the new dinos and items on the mod's Workshop page.\n\nThe normal SpyGlass in Ark certainly has its uses, but the Awesome SpyGlass mod makes it seem irrelevant. This mod turns your vanilla SpyGlass into a beacon of information, allowing you to point it at anything and receive a slew of details about whatever you're targeting. This includes dinos, eggs, supply crates, and just about anything else you can find on your island. You can also customize the SpyGlass with a variety of options that are available right from the mod's menu in-game.\n\nIf you've played Pokémon or even Palworld, then you probably know about the Shiny forms of creatures in those games. Well, the Shiny! Dinos mod brings that mechanic to Ark, giving you extremely rare and differently-colored dinos to track and tame. Dinos with different colors possess special abilities that you can harness if they're tamed, but they can also be killed to receive some unique rewards. These Shiny dinos have the chance to be a beefed-up version of themselves as well, so don't be surprised if you run into an Aberrant or X variant.\n\nThe taming system in the vanilla version of Ark is certainly in-depth, but it can get old after a while. We do have some mods on this list that help improve the taming system, but none are as advanced as the Immersive Taming mod. This mod adds a slew of new taming methods to the game, including giving certain dinos new food, protecting the dino, attacking a dino's target, caring for them, and more. There's also a trust meter with each dino you tame, allowing you to build real bonds with the dinos you capture. This also plays a factor in how hostile dinos act towards you, so the mod really changes up your gameplay when it comes to dino interactions.\n\nVanilla Ark features a degradable gear system that forces you to constantly replenish certain tools and weapons in your inventory after they've been used enough. While this adds to the difficulty of Ark, sometimes you just don't want to worry about an item degrading. Fortunately, the Reusable Plus mod does exactly that, making it so a number of items no longer degrade after they've been created. This includes the grappling hook, spear, parachute, flare gun, and bola.\n\nIf you're playing Ark just for the vibes, the dinos, and the exploration, then you might want a way to make your day-to-day life a little easier. The Simpler Spawners mod aims to give you that easier life. The mod makes it so you can immediately spawn in any creature, resource, nest, or crate wherever you want. While some of the spawns do require you to exchange something else, you can pretty much spawn in whatever you want at any time. This allows you to fully customize your base as well as the entire map. Create a new biome, diversify other areas, and expand your base to be as big as your imagination allows for.\n\nMap mods have become extremely popular in the Ark community over the years. Perhaps the most infamous map mod of them all is the Dome of Death, which spawns you in on a terrifyingly difficult map. The Dome of Death is a small island map that locks you in with some of the most dangerous creatures Ark has to offer. Your goal in the dome is to find valuables that are scattered around the map, but there are creatures guarding them with their lives. You can't enter the dome with any tamed creatures by your side, so it's just you against nature.\n\nThe Auto Torch mod is all about adding some automation to your Ark life. The mod allows you to place timers on all light sources in the game and makes it so they no longer require any fuel. Basically, you're adding the ability to turn lights on and off whenever you want without having to manually go to each light source every day. You can also add some unique colors to the light sources by adding specific resources to them.\n\nDespite the name of this mod, it doesn't actually add any sort of bird creatures into Ark. Instead, what it does is optimize a variety of the game's elements and adds a slew of new creatures for you to kill, capture, or tame. The mod mostly accomplishes this by combining two other very popular mods, the Saurophaganax Mod and the Giant Spino Mod.\n\nWeapons are never in short supply when you're playing Ark, but the Primal Blades mod adds in three highly unique katanas that you can add to your inventory. The mod also adds extra dinos to the game, which drop the special crafting resources you need to create the three individual katanas. However, before the resources drop, you'll have to defeat waves of dinos, so there's much more depth to this mod than simply adding in a few new weapons that you can use.",

Below you'll find the best games that are most like Fallout 4 in one way or the other. If you're more interested in RPGs as a whole, you can check out our list of the best RPGs to play in 2025, or refresh your Fallout experience with the best Fallout 4 mods.\n\nIf you're looking for a game similar to Fallout 4, why not play the RPG by the same developer that preceded it by three years? Skyrim is one of the best-selling RPGs of all time and features plenty of the same gameplay elements and mechanics as the Fallout franchise does. You're given a massive map to explore right from the start, there are several factions to join and complete quests for, and the story can take several twists and turns depending on your choices. Skyrim might be a fantasy game without any guns or grenades, but it still has that classic Bethesda RPG feel to it that's so prevalent in Fallout 4.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nWhile Fallout 4 isn't necessarily considered a scary game, there are some parts that can make you jump in your seat a smidge. If you're looking for more of that feeling, then Metro Exodus is the next post-apocalyptic world you want to dive into. Metro Exodus is a first-person shooter that's set in 2023's Russia after a series of devastating nuclear attacks all across the planet. You play as Artyom, a survivor who's trying to establish contact with other survivors, while also trying not to get killed by the newly formed creatures and harsh environment of the Russian wilderness. Metro Exodus features large, open zones, a story that spans one year through different events, and superb, realistic gunplay. The game can be seen as more of a survival/horror experience, but it still has the FPS and open-world elements that all Fallout fans know and love.\n\nAtomfall is a game that takes clear inspiration from the Fallout franchise. It's a first-person shooter set in a post-apocalyptic world where certain technologies have advanced far beyond what we have today. While the start of the game feels like Fallout, as you continue to play through Atomfall, it becomes clear that it has put several different spins on the experience.\n\nFor starters, Atomfall is a survival game that forces you to manage your hunger, thirst, stamina, and health at all times across a map with several large, open zones. Where Atomfall really shines is in its quest design and storytelling. The game offers you several different quest lines to reach the end credits, and you need to decide which quests to complete to achieve the ending that you think is the best.\n\nWe have another Bethesda RPG, and this time it's the game that Bethesda director Todd Howard referred to as \"Fallout in space.\" Starfield captures that Bethesda Fallout feeling across nearly all facets of the game. There's smooth gunplay, booming and interactive cities, several factions that offer complete questlines, and a story that forces you to explore all across a galaxy of planets.\n\nStarfield also offers you the ability to build a base on any planet you want, which is one of the best parts about Fallout 4. In addition to the base building, Starfield also lets you customize your own spaceship. You can deck out your craft with all sorts of different parts that offer pros and cons for exploration, combat, and aesthetics.\n\nIf Starfield is referred to as \"Skyrim, but in space,\" then The Outer Worlds franchise could be referred to as \"Fallout 4, but in space.\" The Outer Worlds isn't developed by Bethesda, but it is developed by Obsidian Entertainment, the studio behind Fallout: New Vegas. In late 2025, we got The Outer Worlds 2, a sequel to the original game that built a terrific world in a faraway and futuristic galaxy. The Outer Worlds 2 builds on its predecessor while keeping the charm of its characters, rewarding loot system, and fantastic map design. The game allows you to take command of a spaceship, recruit a cast of misfits, and make choices that impact the story and world around you as you solve a conspiracy that will have ramifications on the entire galaxy.\n\nMad Max is arguably one of the most underrated games of the last decade. It features an original story set in the post-apocalyptic world of the film franchise, and, as you might expect, places a large emphasis on vehicles and trying to survive the arid climate of the wasteland. You play as Max, who starts the game barely coming out alive after a conflict with the primary antagonist, Scabrous Scrotus. Scrotus takes Max's prized vehicle, the Magnum Opus, and you spend the entire game trying to retrieve the car from his clutches.\n\nMad Max features a huge open world that you'll traverse with different vehicles you acquire throughout your adventure. You can take down enemy camps, run dangerous quests for different characters, and participate in Death Run races to earn special rewards.\n\nDying Light 2 Stay Human is a game that can be seen as one of the closest experiences to Fallout 4 on this list. Of course, that's if Fallout 4 had parkour, slick movement abilities, and zombies instead of ghouls. The main gameplay element that Dying Light 2 focuses on is its parkour, which affects map traversal in almost every single way. You have access to a huge, post-apocalyptic city, and the entire map is set up for parkour moves and abilities. You also need these parkour elements to escape the hundreds of ravenous zombies that only come out during Dying Light 2's frightening nights.\n\nFallout 4 is set in a post-apocalyptic version of Boston, where nuclear war has ravaged the landscape. While Cyberpunk 2077 doesn't feature a post-apocalyptic world, it does feature an alternate version of San Diego that's set 50 years in the future.\n\nWhile the setting of Cyberpunk 2077 is certainly fascinating, it's the backdrop to one of the best RPG experiences on the market. Cyberpunk 2077 offers a highly interactive and content-filled open world that's dazzling to look at, regardless of where you are. The game offers you multiple ways to engage in combat, and you can enhance your preferred playstyle with unlockable skills and craft technological mods to upgrade your character.\n\nThe Last of Us only shares one or two aspects with Fallout 4, but it's still a game that's absolutely worth playing. It begins with a zombie-style outbreak and fast-forwards several years to a post-apocalyptic future. While The Last of Us uses a third-person perspective and features linear gameplay, it also tells one of the most gripping tales in video game history, which has since been turned into a major TV series on HBO. It might not be an open-world RPG like Fallout 4, but the world and story are all the reasons you need to pick it up.\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn takes the post-apocalypse theme and turns it upside down, as the game takes place more than 1,000 years into the future. During this 1,000-year period, man-made machines have taken over the planet after their AI went rogue during humanity's peak in the 21st century. Horizon Zero Dawn offers a huge open world to explore, hours and hours of lore to listen to and read, and engaging combat that mixes in archery, traps, and melee weapons. If you enjoyed Fallout 4 for the design of the Commonwealth or the mystery behind the story, Horizon Zero Dawn is a perfect game to play next.\n\nThe Division 2 is an online tactical shooter that takes place in the war-torn downtown district of Washington, D.C. after a viral outbreak has brought the nation to its knees. Your objective in The Division 2 is to fend off enemy factions trying to take control of the city. To do that, you and a group of real players need to work together to scavenge loot and supplies across an open map that's split up into zones. You can encounter both AI enemies and other players, but some areas are solely designated for PvP fights. The Division 2 features some elements of an RPG, but it's a multiplayer game at its core that requires you to improve your skills and gear, unless you want an enemy team to bulldoze through you.\n\nBioShock might be one of the older titles on this list, but few games can match the overall immersion that it brings to the table. It's set in the underwater city of Rapture, which was created by a man named Andrew Ryan to escape the ever-changing world above the surface. Through the course of the game, you'll explore every inch of the now-ruined city. Along your way, you can attain new powers and abilities, discover secrets about Rapture and its downfall, and fight off some of the most iconic enemies in video game history. BioShock might not have the freedom of Fallout 4, but it has the exact kind of vibe that you want as a fan of the game.\n\nWe're back with another RPG from Obsidian Entertainment. This time it's the studio's most recent entry, Avowed, which is set in a fictional fantasy land that's engulfed in conflict and intrigue. Avowed features four different large open zones that are almost big enough to be their own open world maps. These zones hold dozens of quests to complete, collectibles to find, and hidden locations that could alter how the story plays out if you find them early enough. Perhaps the best part of Avowed is its combat system and skills menu, which allow you to fight enemies using smooth gunplay, crisp melee weapons, or long-range magic spells or guns. It's a fantastic game from top to bottom that feels like a blend of both Fallout and Skyrim.\n\nWhile you might not initially think Borderlands is a lot like Fallout, the franchise has come a long way in the RPG genre. Borderlands 4, the most recent installment, features a large open world that you can explore as you progress the story. Unlike previous games, there are no loading zones between separate maps, so the entire thing is seamless. You also get to interact with a variety of characters, some of whom act as companions, and take on a plethora of side quests and other objectives throughout the world. The looting aspect of Borderlands 4 is different from Fallout, and the gameplay is much faster-paced, but both are terrific RPGs with large worlds to uncover.\n\nProject Zomboid is a survival sandbox game that's unlike many of the single-player experiences included on this list. What might make Project Zomboid enjoyable for a Fallout 4 fan is the open-world exploration and expansive base building elements. The game forces you to deal with swarms of zombies all across the open map, and to fend them off, you need to scrounge for resources that you can use to craft weapons, gear, and other items at your base. While the base-building in Project Zomboid is quite different from Fallout 4, you can make immensely large bases that allow you to sustain yourself in the post-apocalypse.\n\nIf the exploration and story are your favorite parts of Fallout 4, then Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden is a great addition to your game library. The game is set in a post-human version of Earth where different creatures have risen up to dominate the planet. You control a party of these creatures and can explore a slew of unique environments that all present different challenges. At the heart of Mutant Year Zero is turn-based combat, which is akin to something like XCOM. The combat might throw off FPS fans at first, but after you get used to it, you'll be engaged and start strategizing various ways to win fights by controlling your entire party of mutants.\n\nThe Warhammer 40000 franchise is known for its narrative-driven gameplay and engaging RPGs. Rogue Trader is another RPG that centers around turn-based combat and assembling a party of different characters for you to control. You can recruit a plethora of characters to join you, and each of them have various attacking styles, weapons, and abilities. When you're not in combat, you can explore a large world where the story plays a major role in everything you do. The choices you make throughout the story affect what happens later in the game and your eventual ending. It's an excellent RPG that blends the exploration and narrative parts of Fallout 4 with strategic, turn-based combat.\n\nWe've already mentioned The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, but pound for pound, its predecessor, Oblivion, might be the better overall RPG. While you can still go back and play the original, Bethesda released a fully remastered version of Oblivion at the start of 2025. The remaster is done wonderfully, as bugs have been fixed, graphics have been improved, and quality-of-life updates are live, including the ability to sprint. At its core, though, Oblivion Remastered is the same premier RPG that showcases Bethesda at its best in terms of gameplay design and world-building.",

    "fullText": "and \n Joey Carr\n on January 6, 2026 at 11:58AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nSometimes, it's nice to sit down on a quiet day and figure out a puzzle. Crosswords, jumbles, and other word-based puzzle games have appeared in newspapers for dozens of years, and the evolution of that premise--the puzzle video game--has created the same sort of brain-teasing brilliance on our TV screens.\n\nBelow are some of the best puzzle games available today: 22 games that challenge your critical-thinking skills in ways other games simply cannot manage. Some of these are newer games--including one indie darling that's recently taken the world by storm--while others have been around for quite a long time. Puzzle games offer some of the most engaging gameplay experiences in video games, and these 22 currently sit at the top of the puzzler pile.\n\nFor the best of the best in other genres, check out our rundowns of the best RPGs, best open-world games, and best racing games currently available.\n\nThe most recent puzzle game on this list has become the apple of the entire gaming industry's eye since it launched in April. Blue Prince follows a teenage boy named Simon as he tries to find a hidden 46th room in a mansion with 45 rooms--but no two visits are the same. Simon must \"draft\" a room with different properties, items, and configurations in order to reach Room 46 and complete his task, but doing so is no small task … and for every question you answer along the way, two more are asked in its place. Oh, and when you do reach Room 46 and the credits roll, well, that's when the game actually begins.\n\nIf you dig the game, be sure to check our some other great games like Blue Prince.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nThe Outer Wilds is an intriguing experiment of a game, with time serving as the central conceit--how much can you explore in only 22 real-world minutes? The unnamed spacefarer starts in the same location during each run, and after 22 minutes--or if the spacefarer should die--the cycle repeats itself. In that limited time--and across multiple runs, you'll gather clues, make discoveries, and solve the mystery of the Nomai, an extinct race that built the space stations hovering overhead. The Outer Wilds is a truly unique experience, and one with a fascinating puzzle to solve at its core.\n\nA merchant ship, lost at sea for five years, suddenly appears off the English coast, but with none of its crew aboard. As an investigator for the East India Company, it's your job to find out what happened to the crew and the Obra Dinn itself through the Memento Mortem, a pocketwatch-like item that can recreate the moment of someone's death. With it, you must solve the massive puzzle in front of you, while determining the interconnected fates of all 60 known crew members. Return of the Obra Dinn is a remarkable game, with a distinct low-resolution graphical style and a few \"a ha!\" moments that other games simply cannot replicate.\n\nTetris's classic line-clearing gameplay has been delighting players for decades now, but there's something about the way Enhance's take on the puzzler with Tetris Effect completely enhances the experience, especially in VR. Ethereal wisps flying across the screen, lights pulsing to the beat of the incredible soundtrack, and flashes of brilliant light at key moments make Tetris Effect--and its expansion, Connected--one of the best ways to play Tetris available today.\n\nIn The Talos Principle, an android solves a series of puzzles and becomes the progenitor of a new robotic civilization, after the death of humanity from global warming. Talos Principle 2 continues that story, but adds on a layer of political intrigue and tension that drives you to solve the puzzles even more. Croteam has devised some of the most thought-provoking challenges on this list, and the reward for solving them is a story rooted in real-world issues despite being told through the eyes of robots.\n\nBaba Is You is a puzzle game where you push blocks, but the blocks are words that represent certain actions. It's also a game that plays by its own rules--specifically, it allows you to change the rules as you progress, solving puzzles through the new rules you create. By shifting the words around the stage, you can fundamentally change how the world works around you, which creates some truly baffling challenges that stay with you long after you've completed them. This one has flown under the radar for most players, but those that have played Baba Is You cannot say enough about it.\n\nImagine finding an old photo book and holding one of the photos inside to your eye level, only to find that the image has somehow superimposed itself on the real-world and you can walk into it to explore. That's Viewfinder at its core, and puzzles are solved by strategically placing photos in this manner all over the world to create paths and access teleporters that take you to the next stage. It's a novel approach to the puzzle genre, as each picture warps the world in cool and interesting ways that it's always surprising to see how things turn out.\n\nRemaking one of the best puzzle games in the world is no small task, but Cyan did an incredible job bringing Riven--the sequel to the massively influential PC puzzler Myst--into the modern age with the 2023 remake. Riven is a sprawling adventure in the mystical world of D'Ni, where an ancient race hides its secret behind massive, mind-bending puzzles. Nothing about what made Riven so magical in the first place--from the unique puzzles to the always-foreboding atmosphere--is lost in translation through Riven's modernization, and the result is the new best way to relive this absolute classic.\n\nSpeaking of Myst, The Witness plays a lot like the early-'90s classic--you're thrown into a mysterious island, filled with puzzles littering the entire landscape, and the more progress you make, the more you learn about the world around you. This is also one for the completionists; though it's not required to finish the game's story, there are 650 puzzles scattered around The Witness's world. See if you can solve them all.\n\nBotany Manor might be the most \"zen\" game on this list, as its go-at-your-own-pace structure and relaxing vibes make it a great way to find some calm at the end of the day. The point-and-click game tasks you with growing magical flowers, called Forgotten Flora, and you must find clues on how to do so, as well as the items needed, scattered throughout the manor. Once you have the parameters for each plant, you must create the correct environment in the greenhouse, and then you'll have your Forgotten Flora. If you want to cozy up on the couch with a low-stakes game, Botany Manor fits the bill.\n\nThe original Portal bent your mind into a pretzel with its first-person, physics-based, portal-powered puzzle solving fueled by the sarcastic and sadistic AI GlaDOS, all within a tidy package that could be wrapped up in a few hours. Portal 2 ups the ante with a much longer campaign, as it also adds lasers, tractor beams, colored paints with different properties, and a new AI named Wheatley with a devious side of his own. Portal 2 is simply a classic, and a game that everyone should try for themselves at least once.\n\nA lot of the puzzle games we've seen so far use environmental aspects to challenge your mind, but none of them are centered around translating fictional languages, writing systems, and other word-based mechanics in order to more fully understand the world around them. Chants of Sennaar does this incredibly well, all while telling a tale about language barriers and their ability to separate the world around us. Chants of Sennaar was a big surprise hit when it launched in 2023, and you'll understand why the first time you boot up the game--no words required.\n\nThat The Room--which began as a mobile title over a decade ago--still ranks as one of the best puzzle games ever made should give you an idea of just how enjoyable it is. The presentation is as simple as it gets--it's a box with puzzles, and as you solve them, the larger box disappears and a smaller box is revealed--but the solutions are dastardly clever, and the accompanying letters add an interesting bit of world-building to the puzzle-solving experience. There have been many Room games released since 2012, but you never forget your first.\n\nLorelei and the Laser Eyes is the kind of puzzle game where taking notes is paramount, as the game's 150 puzzles can be solved in any order you prefer, so if you have to backtrack, you'll want to remember what you've done. It's also the kind of puzzle game that will make you want to solve \"one more puzzle\" to learn more about what's going on in this weird house and who's behind it all. A puzzle game and an interesting mystery? Say no more.\n\nA stream of humans are walking down a path, and you have to lead them to a specific destination. What better way to do this than with a cute little doggo made of light? You'll assign certain actions to humans in the mob as you progress, with strategically placed actions being essential to the overall goal of getting these people where they're going. Humanity hearkens back to the days of Lemmings in a fun and interesting way, and best of all, cute little doggo!\n\n\"MATCH DNA BUBBLES IN AN UNDERGROUND LAB TO KEEP YOUR PSYCHIC CLONE FROM INVADING YOUR MIND AND TURNING YOU INTO A CANNIBAL.\" That's the game's official description on its Steam page, and frankly it sets the tone pretty well. Battling the many dinos and rednecks in the creepy mansion is done through a match-3 puzzle system, and the wacky enemies keep a smile on your face while you're doing it. The story is a commentary on video games as a whole too, which explains the \"3\" in the title--don't go looking for Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 1 or 2 … they don't actually exist.\n\nRise of the Golden Idol couples stellar storytelling with a simple point-and-click system, where finding names, actions, and other important terms through investigation allows you to (literally) fill in the blanks on what's going down in the scene in front of you. The overarching story has a lot of interesting twists and turns, and you'll never actually know what's coming next, but that's part of the fun. Color Gray Games has a true hit on their hands with the Golden Idol series.\n\nPuzzle Quest 2 frames a high fantasy story with elves, orcs, and magic within a match-3 format, and it was a big inspiration to similar games that followed--like the previously mentioned Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3. Each colored gem holds a specific attribute when matched--red, for example, increases the chance of a critical hit on the next attack--and your abilities rely on the class you choose at the beginning of the game--Barbarian, Sorcerer, Assassin, and Templar. There have been sequels and spin-offs, but for the peak Puzzle Quest experience, Puzzle Quest 2 is the one to check out.\n\nAnimal Well is a pixelated and atmospheric puzzle game that sees you dive down into the depths of a dark and mysterious world. You'll need to solve a variety of puzzles, interact with the environment, and deal with dozens of different creatures to find a path forward and progress to a new level. As you move along, you can place candles on the ground to light up your surroundings so you can attempt to uncover some secrets or potentially a new item to aid you in your journey. Animal Well is completely nonlinear as well, so you can explore the game at your own pace and follow whichever path you want.\n\nAntichamber is an older puzzle game, but it's one that still holds up extremely well today. It's clearly inspired by the Portal series, but it's much different from those experiences. For starters, the graphics look like they were drawn onto your screen with a pencil, which takes some time to adjust to. Once you do, you have to somehow navigate your way through mind-bending halls that all connect in some shape or fashion. You'll also encounter a number of geometric objects that don't obey the laws of physics in any way. To deal with everything in your path, you're given a matter gun that can manipulate objects and space around you, and this tool is imperative to solving the numerous puzzles that emerge as you try and explore more of the areas Antichamber offers.\n\nLingo 2 is an in-depth puzzle game that has a little something for every player. It features a wide array of different kinds of puzzles, ranging from word puzzles to geometry problems. The entire map in Lingo 2 unfolds as you explore it, and that only happens as you solve more puzzles that you come across. The game only features puzzles, so don't worry about any jump scares or tricky combat to interrupt your puzzle-solving flow.\n\nWhen it comes to traditional puzzle games, Split Fiction doesn't fall as neatly into the genre as others on this list. However, there are a large number of puzzles to solve throughout this co-op action-adventure game that should satisfy any puzzle fan's craving. Split Fiction needs to be played with another person, and with your partner, you'll enter different levels brought to life by two authors, who are the characters you control in split-screen action. The game features action-packed combat, heart-warming storytelling, and plenty of puzzles featured in both the main story and side activities. If you have someone to play with, Split Fiction will surprise you even if you don't traditionally play these types of games.",

    "fullText": "and \n Joey Carr\n on January 6, 2026 at 11:54AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nIt was Ultima creator Richard Garriott who first coined the term MMORPG--massively multiplayer online role-playing game--to describe 1997's Ultima Online. Flash-forward to 2026, and many of the best MMORPGs to play today are ones that embody the same elements that made early classics like EverQuest, Asheron's Call, and Ultima Online so popular: namely, long-term character progression and persistent online worlds filled with hundreds or even thousands of other players to meet, compete against, or interact with.\n\nWorld of Warcraft helped break MMORPGs into the mainstream when it first released in 2004, making many of the genre's signature ideas more appealing to a wider audience. For a few years after its release, it seemed like every major video game publisher wanted to copy Blizzard's formula (and monthly subscription-based revenue), and MMORPGs became a hot new genre.\n\nUnfortunately, few of the games that chased WoW's success found much of their own. Publishers soured on the genre before too long, resulting in a draught of new MMORPGs over the last decade when compared to other popular game genres (even if many of them, like some of the best survival games or multiplayer shooters, now borrow heavily from MMORPGs). As a result, many of the most popular games MMORPGs today are the same titles that were popular in the early-mid 2000s. Some have existed for decades and require subscriptions to play, even as others have more recently shifted to a free-to-play model.\n\nThere's never been a better time to get lost in a living, breathing online world, something only the best MMORPGs can provide. Below you'll find a list, in no particular order, of some of the top MMORPGs to play in 2026, ranging from tried-and-true classics of the genre to hybrids that combine the best of traditional fantasy-themed MMOs with elements of shooters, space exploration, and more. Some of the games below also happen to be some of the best free-to-play games available.\n\nBlizzard might not have invented the MMORPG, but it certainly popularized it, as it took a genre known for having a steep learning curve and made it more approachable than ever before with streamlined mechanics, punchy combat, instanced dungeons and raids, and its signature level of polish. As a result, WoW is still going strong today and remains one of the best PC MMORPGs to play, having received nine expansions to date (with a 10th on the way). In WoW, players choose a faction--the Alliance or the Horde--as well as a race and class, and from there embark on an adventure to defend the fantasy world of Azeroth from all manner of threats. Each of the game's 13 classes feels distinct, with multiple sub-classes to choose from, and there's an ever-expanding list of fantasy races to play as and customize.\n\nWoW celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2024, as Blizzard kicked-off a three-expansion storyline called The Worldsoul Saga with the release of the game's excellent and approachable The War Within expansion. Blizzard celebrated WoW's big anniversary by dropping some big news as well--after two decades, WoW will finally receive player housing as part of its next expansion, and in a recent preview made clear that unlike in some MMOs, housing in WoW will be available for everyone.\n\nWhile the main version of WoW has continued to evolve over the last 20 years, a large and vocal contingent of fans yearned for the early days of the MMO, before more-recent expansions forever transformed the game's world and Blizzard updated much of its visuals, gameplay, and classes. Blizzard finally listened in 2019 with the release of WoW Classic, a return to the game's earliest, pre-expansion days.\n\nWoW Classic's release proved to be a huge success, and Blizzard now offers multiple different flavors of old-school WoW all under one subscription price, one that also grants access to the modern version of WoW. Players can still check out the 2004-era version of Azeroth (which received new servers to start fresh on in November 2024 for the game's 20th anniversary), or move forward in time and play one of the game's older expansions, like 2010's Cataclysm (soon to be 2012's Mists of Pandaria). There are even seasonal servers, like the still ongoing Season of Discovery, which adds new items, raid content, and class changes to the original version of Blizzard's genre-defining title.\n\nSince the genre's inception, many MMORPGs have featured familiar sword-and-sorcery trappings. It only makes sense then that the granddaddy of the modern fantasy genre, The Lord of the Rings, was a prime candidate to get the MMO treatment following the massive success of WoW. Enter The Lord of the Rings Online, a game that couldn't have come from a more veteran MMORPG team, with developer Turbine having been responsible for MMO classics like 1999's Asheron's Call and its sequel. The Lord of the Rings Online has since changed developers, but its current developer, Standing Stone Games, is composed of many former Turbine developers. Better yet, it still receives new content updates and expansions, with its most recent, Legacy of Morgoth, having arrived in November 2024.\n\nThough very much following in the footsteps of WoW, it fittingly places a much larger emphasis on story than Blizzard's MMO and delivers a painstakingly detailed version of JRR Tolkien's Middle-earth for players to explore and immerse themselves in.\n\nFinal Fantasy is one of the biggest RPG franchises of all time, and as such has not one, but two MMORPGs to its name. Though 2002's Final Fantasy XI is still playable, it's Square Enix's more-recent MMO, Final Fantasy XIV, that has blossomed into one of the best MMORPGs of all time. When it was first released, it was a critical and commercial failure. But several years and many updates later, the game was re-released as Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, completely reworking many of the original game's systems, story, and structure. Now, Final Fantasy XIV is one of the top MMORPG games today and one of the best PS5 and Xbox MMORPGs available, having long been playable on PlayStation and more recently launching on Xbox Series X|S.\n\nIts flexible job system means players don't need to create a new character every time they want to try a new role, and despite being a MMORPG with a massive shared world to explore, its main story, over-the-top boss battles, and excellent music all deliver on what RPG fans expect from a game sharing the Final Fantasy name. Its latest expansion, Dawntrail, released in July 2024.\n\nFuncom is no stranger to MMORPGs, having previously made titles like Anarchy Online and Age of Conan. The studio's latest foray into the genre is its most ambitious yet, adapting author Frank Herbert's sci-fi Dune saga into a massive survival MMORPG where players battle to survive on the harsh desert world of Arakkis. Dune: Awakening is definitely a survival game first and foremost, with players needing to gather resources, manage their water levels, build shelter, and advance their gear to progress.\n\nHowever, MMO staples like faction reputation, class-skill trees, open-world dungeons, and a massive, ever-changing endgame PvP zone that brings together hundreds of players also firmly make Dune: Awakening a MMORPG. Its unique mix of third-person shooting, melee, and vehicular combat helps to further distinguish it from the many fantasy-themed MMOs on the market, making for an enticing combination of genres, gameplay, and aesthetics. Just keep in mind that getting killed by one of the desert's massive sandworms means losing everything on your character at that moment--the desert claims the weak.\n\nOne of the first big new MMORPGs in years, Amazon's New World made quite a splash when it released in 2021, breaking concurrent player records on Steam. The hype has since died down quite a bit, but New World is still an extremely solid MMORPG that received a major overhaul on PC and launched on consoles in the form of New World: Aeternum in October 2024. In New World: Aeternum, players wash up the mysterious island from which the game takes its name, one that has trapped various civilizations and explorers from throughout human history. From there they join one of three different factions, each with their own idea of what to do with the mystical land they now call home. Instead of classes, players instead can equip two different weapon types, which define what skills can be used and what stats a player may want to strive for when gearing their character.\n\nThe New World: Aeternum update bundled in the game's sole expansion, and in the process significantly reworked much of the game's story and its early-game questing, two of its biggest weaknesses prior to the update. Amazon also recently debuted seasonal servers that change up New World: Aeternum's normal gameplay in major ways, ranging from servers that put a heavy focus on open-world PvP to \"hardcore\" servers with faster progression where the goal is to never die even once.\n\nThe developer behind the Halo series took many of the ideas popularized in MMORPGs like WoW--dungeons, raids, classes, special abilities, color-coated loot--and applied it to a smaller-scale, sci-fi FPS. The result was Destiny and its sequel, Destiny 2. Bungie has proven it's still king when it comes to making a great-feeling shooter, and it never gets old blasting ancient aliens or genocidal robots with all manner of Destiny's 2 powerful Exotic weapons. When combined with the social elements of MMOs like shared worlds to explore, larger-scale public events, and multiplayer dungeons and raids filled with complex puzzles and mechanics, Destiny 2 forms an impressive genre cocktail that can be hard to put down.\n\nEverything Bungie has been building towards for over a decade may have culminated in 2024's The Final Shape expansion, but Destiny 2 is still receiving new updates and expansions, with the new Edge of Fate expansion releasing July 15. Destiny 2 is also widely available, making it both one of the best cross-platform games to play with friends and one of the best PS5 and Xbox MMORPG games out there.\n\nGuild Wars 2 was a breath of fresh air when it released in 2012, and for good reason. It put a new spin on many of the tried-and-true tropes and systems seen in popular MMORPGs like WoW, with an emphasis on open-world content. Combined with its flashy movement, impressive visuals compared to many other MMOs, and engaging combat that combines class skills with unique weapon abilities, Guild Wars 2 still stands out from the competition as one of the top MMORPG games available on PC.\n\nIn 2025, Guild Wars 2 is still regularly receiving new updates and expansions, in part thanks to a recent restructuring of how developer ArenaNet develops new content. Its latest expansion, Janthir Wilds, introduced several new big features, including player housing and the spear weapon-type. Unlike many of the biggest MMORPGs, Guild Wars 2 doesn't require a subscription to play, making it an appealing choice for aspiring MMO players on a budget.\n\nOne of the more popular Korean MMORPGs, Lost Ark came to the West with the help of Amazon Games and quickly set itself apart thanks to its isometric perspective and lack of a box price or mandatory subscription fee. In Lost Ark, players choose a class and then embark on a quest to discover the titular lost Arks scattered throughout the fantasy world of Arkesia. It's a journey that takes players to both huge, story-heavy new continents and to small, one-off islands that are home to some truly fun minigame events, all which players sail to on their own personal boat.\n\nSprinkle in some truly fantastic endgame raids and impressive Monster Hunter-like boss battles, and Lost Ark is well worth playing for those looking for a MMORPG that plays closer to some of the best Diablo-like games than it does WoW, albeit minus the fountains of loot. Three years later, the game is still receiving frequent updates, with a new class, the shapeshifting Wildsoul, debuting in February 2025.\n\nFallout 76 didn't exactly have a smooth start in 2018, with players criticizing it for a laundry list of bugs, performance issues, lack of NPC characters, and more. But Bethesda never gave up on its multiplayer Fallout experiment, and in 2025, Fallout 76 is a great way to experience one of gaming's best RPG universes alongside dozens of other players.\n\nLike traditional Fallout games, players scrounge their way through an apocalyptic wasteland on the hunt for supplies and gear. Unlike single-player entries in the franchise, however, dozens of players in Fallout 76 can team up to fend off waves of Super Mutants, battle massive monsters as part of the game's numerous public events, or even drop nukes on one another. Bethesda added Expeditions to the list of things to do in Fallout 76 back in 2022. These allow players to team up and venture outside the game's Appalachian Wasteland to other scenic locales, like Fallout 3's The Pitt, for dungeon-like missions, further giving the FPS RPG a distinct MMO flavor.\n\nFallout 76 has seen a resurgence in interest thanks to the launch of the TV show adaptation, making this a great time to jump in. Its most recent content update, Gone Fission, added fishing as a new activity, with players able to complete various fishing-themed quests and upgrade their fishing pole to tackle new challenges. For more on the franchise, check out our look at the best Fallout games.\n\nStar Wars: The Old Republic will feel familiar to anyone who has played WoW but is no less worthy a time investment for those looking to dive deeper into the Star Wars universe. Originally developed by BioWare, a studio known for its RPG storytelling, Star Wars: The Old Republic unsurprisingly puts its story front and center, with dialogue wheels, fully voiced characters, and impactful narrative choices that feel right at home in a single-player RPG. It also features unique storylines for each of the game's eight classes, meaning there is plenty of replay value for players who can't make up their mind on which class to play. As much as it emulates WoW in its gameplay, Star Wars: The Old Republic does include features that have yet to come to Blizzard's MMO, including player housing and NPC companions.\n\nThough the game recently changed developers (with some former members of BioWare joining Broadsword, which also oversees classic MMORPGs owned by EA like Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot), it still receives new story content and events, making it the top MMORPG game for Star Wars fans and one of the best Star Wars games of all time.\n\nWhile it may still be quite some time until The Elder Scrolls 6, those longing for a return to Tamriel will find plenty to enjoy in The Elder Scrolls Online, which celebrated its 10th anniversary last year. The MMORPG spin on Bethesda's popular RPG series will feel familiar to those who have played single-player entries in the franchise, with the ability to play in first or third-person, NPC companions, various guilds to join, options to steal from NPCs, and more. Players choose an assortment of skills both from their chosen weapon and armor type but also their class in order to make unique builds that can be used to conquer dungeons and raids with other players. Compared to other, more-traditional MMORPGs playable on consoles, its smaller number of skills and easy-to-read user interface make ESO one of the top Xbox and PS5 MMORPG games, even if it sadly doesn't support cross-play or cross-progression across platforms.\n\nIn 2025, developer ZeniMax Online is making some big changes to ESO's content schedule. It's forgoing the yearly expansion model used for almost a decade and instead focusing on smaller, more frequent seasonal updates that will help to deliver on efforts to improve the game across the board. Those efforts include major experiments like Cyrodiil Champions meant to improve the MMO's open-world PvP and a renewed focus on the new and returning player experience. Its current season, Seasons of the Worm Cult, continues the base game's main storyline, while a free update for all players in June added the ability to subclass, allowing for the mixing and matching of abilities from different classes in order to create entirely new playstyles.\n\nIt may not look like much, but Runescape, which is now in its 23rd year and comes in both its slightly-more-modern Runescape 3 form as well as Old School Runescape, is still one of the best MMORPG games of all time. It may be simple by modern standards, but there is a certain joy to be found in its point-and-click gameplay and its monotonous, yet satisfying, crafting skill grind.\n\nLike all great sandbox MMORPGs, Runescape largely leaves players to decide for themselves what interests to pursue, whether it's completing quests, mastering their crafting skills, or player-killing out in the Wilderness. It's one of the few great mobile MMORPG games available, complete with cross-play and cross-progression across platforms. Those who want to get the full Runescape experience will likely want to Jagex recently announced the first new skill in Old School Runescape history, sailing, will be added later in 2025.\n\nFor those who want a little more Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (with a large dose of anime) in their MMORPG, Tower of Fantasy is exactly what the doctor ordered. It shares plenty of DNA with the more-popular (but also largely single-player) Genshin Impact, but distinguishes itself with its shared open world, public events, co-op dungeons and a more sci-fi aesthetic. There's always something to explore, and it's easy to climb any mountain or glide to any distant spot that sparks interest. Similar to Genshin, its character-swapping action combat combined with each character's various elemental affinities keeps Tower of Fantasy's moment-to-moment gameplay interesting, especially as players earn new characters, form teams, and create new combos.\n\nThough players are more than capable of playing through its main story and many of its challenges with the game's various free characters, be warned that this is a gacha game, and many of its best characters will be inaccessible without spending large sums of money on the premium currency used to make luck-of-the-draw pulls.\n\nLike Destiny 2, Warframe isn't what many players would think of when it comes to a traditional MMORPG, but it has so many elements of the genre--shared spaces with large numbers of players, instanced dungeons and raids, high levels of customizability, crafting, guilds, etc.--that it's an MMO in all but name. Warframe has been around for over a decade, and in that time has continued to deliver best-in-class third-person-shooter gameplay alongside game-changing updates that have introduced spaceship combat, large-scale open worlds, and new story content to its sci-fi, cyber-ninja-filled universe.\n\nWith a \"Very Positive\" average user review score after over half a million reviews and counting on Steam, Warframe continues to impress, and features cross-play and cross-progression across PC, iOS, and consoles. It's also available on Nintendo Switch, making it one of the best Switch MMORPG games. A fantasy-themed successor, Soulframe, is slated to receive an open pre-alpha playtest this year.\n\nA top-down fantasy MMORPG that will look and feel familiar to Runescape fans, Albion Online takes its sandbox gameplay even further, with an almost entirely player-run economy, classless combat, and a focus on full-loot PvP with large-scale guild battles over territory. With PvP being such a large part of the endgame, and the high stakes of losing one's items when dying in PvP, Albion Online won't be for everyone.\n\nThere is PvE as well, with dungeons to explore and bosses to slay. For more farming or crafting-minded players, there is also the ability to build a home or even buy a private island and transform it into a farm, too. Few MMORPGs in the modern age truly commit to a sandbox approach like Albion Online, making it more than worth checking out, but those who have no interest in PvP or are easily frustrated by setbacks may want to look elsewhere.\n\nFor those who want to live out a superhero (or villain) fantasy instead of the sword-and-sorcery kind, there's DC Universe Online. Players can create their character, choose from a number of different powers, customize their costume, and then fight alongside iconic DC characters while exploring locations like Gotham City, Metropolis, and Arkham Asylum. DC Universe Online has been going steady for 14 years now and still receives multiple new episodic story updates for free each year. The latest episode, the Lantern Corp-focused Fearful Day, released in May\n\nAll of DCUO's new story content is free, though those with an optional subscription will be able to enjoy more rewards, character slots, and powers to choose from. DCUO isn't the only superhero MMORPG on the block, but its wide availability on both consoles and PC (and cross-play between PlayStation and PC players) does make it an easy choice for this list.\n\nThrone and Liberty's gameplay will instantly feel familiar to anyone who has played an MMORPG in the last two decades, with tab-targeting combat that heavily evokes WoW's gameplay. Where Throne and Liberty differs is in its impressive graphical fidelity, focus on open-world PvP, skills defined by weapon type instead of classes, and the use of players' animal-shapeshifting forms in order to sprint, glide, and swim around its world of Solisium instead of traditional mounts. Though much of its endgame focus is on large guild vs. guild castle sieges, there is still plenty of PvE content as well, including world events and dungeons.\n\nGiven its free-to-play nature, its endgame can become a bit grindy, but those looking for a satisfying MMORPG without a subscription could do much worse than Throne and Liberty. It's also one of the few MMORPGs on consoles, and, unlike other console MMOs like ESO, supports cross-play between platforms. Its first free expansion, Wilds of Talandre, releases in March 2025 and will introduce a new zone to explore, solo dungeons for players to conquer, and a revamp of its weapon mastery system.\n\nKnown for its massive spaceship battles with thousands of players, EVE Online is still one of the best MMORPGs available after two decades on the market. A true sandbox MMO where players are largely left to pursue their own interests--whether that's engaging in PvP battles or starting a trade empire--the entirety of its player base plays on a single server, and the actions its players take leave a lasting impact both on its in-game universe and its bustling player-driven economy.\n\nEven if its actual gameplay isn't quite as exciting as it might sound on paper (get used to looking at lots of menus and going AFK while your ship completes assigned actions), it's the stakes behind each action that give everything in EVE Online's world meaning. EVE Online can certainly be confusing for new players, but for those who stick with it and get involved with its various player-run communities, it's easy to see why the game is still being played 20 years later.\n\nThe original superhero MMO, 2004's City of Heroes, has found new life after having been taken offline by NCSoft in 2012. A fan server called City of Heroes: Homecoming received an official license to operate the game in 2024, and now City of Heroes is once again playable completely for free, with a volunteer team keeping the game running and updated thanks to player donations.\n\nCity of Heroes stands out thanks to its detailed character creator, where players get to choose not only their powers, but their origin story, costume, and even backstory. From there it's up to players to protect Paragon City as a hero or join the forces of villainy on The Rogues Isle, battling foes and joining Supergroups of other players along the way. Though City of Heroes is somewhat dated by today's standards, there is a reason many players have fond memories of their time with the MMO, as it offers a unique experience that can't be found in other games within the genre, even as games like DC Universe Online and Cryptic's spiritual successor, Champions Online, have since looked to follow in City of Heroes' footsteps.\n\nBlack Desert is a highly in-depth MMORPG that places a major emphasis on combat systems and customization. You might have heard that Black Desert has one of the steepest learning curves of any MMO, and that statement wouldn't be inaccurate. There are over a dozen classes to pick from in Black Desert, and each one offers a totally different way of approaching combat. You'll mostly engage in combat with real players and AI enemies, both of which require the utmost precision and lightning-fast reflexes to defeat. However, Black Desert also offers siege combat, allowing you to participate in large-scale wars in PvE or PvP.\n\nIf combat isn't your main interest, Black Desert features a massively open world with a slew of content to explore. You can complete quests, level up a slew of skills, and hunt for new gear. You'll also be able to customize your character in truly staggering ways, as the game has hundreds of clothing and appearance options.\n\nOnce Human isn't your traditional World of Warcraft-type MMORPG, but it's still a massive role-playing game nonetheless. The game starts by you joining a server and going through a tutorial for how its various mechanics work. Then, you'll be on your own in a huge map that features differently-scaled areas. Each area is available for you to venture into from the start, but the enemies in an area will all be at a specific level. To successfully navigate the areas, you need to level up your character by completing main story quests, which mainly involve the same gameplay loop, and jobs for various NPCs at the hub center of each area.\n\nCombat in Once Human involves guns as well as melee and long-range weapons, and all of the weapons in the game can be crafted at your base. Base-building plays a major role in Once Human, as it's how you unlock a majority of the game's usable content and helps to level up your character. When you venture outside your base, though, you'll have to keep your character healthy, as Once Human is also a survival game that has a hunger, thirst, and stamina bar, all of which need to be constantly maintained. It's a unique MMO experience that relies less on multiplayer elements, but other real players are still packed into a server with you.\n\nThe First Descendant is a game that falls somewhere in between a few different genres. However, by definition, it's a massively multiplayer online game that features role-playing elements. At its core, however, The First Descendant is a looter shooter that allows you to team up with other players to complete PvE objectives and defeat bosses. There is no PvP combat, but there's certainly enough content to keep you invested. The looting, which comes from defeating enemies and quests, is mostly RNG, so you'll often have to grind for hours to unlock a piece of content for your character or weapons. The gameplay is extremely enjoyable, though, so you'll often have no quarrel with grinding out gear.\n\nPalia is one of the very few MMORPGs that doesn't feature any sort of combat. Instead, you're placed in a world where you're tasked with building your dream home. Set in a fantasy world, Palia also falls into the life-simulator genre, allowing you to build and create anything your imagination can cook up. Of course, not everything is handed to you, as you'll have to venture out into the world to explore the various towns and other environments. Everywhere in Palia is teeming with life, and you'll even meet other players in the various hub areas, or you can visit them at the home they've built. Palia also offers plenty of lore that you learn as you explore, making it feel like you're a part of a real community.",

    "title": "The Invisible Commons: An Open Source History in the Style of Kenneth Clark",
    "description": "A speculative ‘Episode 14’ of 'Civilisation' in the spirit of Kenneth Clark, observing how courtesy, discipline, curiosity, conscience, and patience shaped the invisible civic infrastructure of the digital age.",
    "fullText": "When this series last ended in 1969, Kenneth Clark left behind an unease. The modern world possessed immense energy and extraordinary technical power, yet what earlier civilisations had assumed almost instinctively — a centre — was no longer obvious.\n\nIn the decades since, progress has only accelerated. Communication has become global, calculation instantaneous, and information pervasive. These achievements are remarkable. But power alone does not create civilisation. Energy, however abundant, does not by itself produce order. Without shared forms — without agreement about how knowledge is shaped, preserved, and handed on — progress becomes empty motion.\n\nAnd yet civilisation did not collapse.\n\nWe did not abandon the physical world — we still enjoy good food, need sleep, and seek shelter from the cold. But the centre of our shared life began to shift. Increasingly, what mattered most was not the mass of things we possessed, but the structures through which we cooperated: the ways knowledge was recorded, shared, corrected, and carried forward. In these invisible arrangements, civilisation found new means of continuity.\n\nIt is this reconfiguration — subtle, incomplete, and still fragile — that I want to consider here.\n\nThis development was not, in truth, without precedent. Civilisation has never been sustained by authority alone. Even in periods of strong government or settled belief, its real work has relied on voluntary association — on people choosing to cooperate around a shared purpose worth sustaining.\n\nIn the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, this impulse found expression in what came to be known as the Republic of Letters. It was a territory defined not by borders, but by ink. Ideas travelled slowly between desks and studies, often ignoring the wars of their kings. A philosopher in Paris could dispute first principles with a mathematician in Cambridge; a writer in exile could remain part of a continental conversation.\n\nThey shared no ruler and acknowledged no single doctrine. They differed sharply in temperament and belief, yet understood themselves to be citizens of the same country. What bound them were standards: of evidence, of argument, and of courtesy. Knowledge, in this world, was not a possession to be hoarded, but a light to be shared.\n\nFor a long time, this spirit receded from view. The industrial age taught us the virtues of enclosure. We built fences around land, walls around factories, and increasingly, legal barriers around ideas. Where value was material, scarce, and costly to produce, ownership became the principal means by which it was recognised and protected — and it still serves us well.\n\nBut toward the end of the twentieth century, a curious pattern re-emerged. Among scientists, engineers, and students working at the edges of a new digital machinery, the established forms of enclosure proved inadequate. To build systems of great complexity with unprecedented reach, one could not behave solely as a proprietor. One had to act, instead, as a participant.\n\nGradually, and without central direction, new commons took shape. Spaces in which the work of one person was offered to the use of many; in which contribution mattered more than possession; and in which rules were sustained not by decree, but by shared understanding. These arrangements relied on a quiet optimism — the belief that human beings, given the opportunity, would prefer to build together rather than to destroy alone.\n\nThey remain fragile. They are easily misunderstood, and easily neglected. Yet upon this assumption — modest, generous, and profoundly human — much of our contemporary civilisation has come to rest.\n\nThe reordering of our digital world began, fittingly, not in a marketplace, but in a place of inquiry. By the late 1980s, computers were already powerful and networks increasingly widespread, yet information remained confined within isolated systems. To move from one to another required a change of language, protocol, or machine. Knowledge existed, but it did not yet flow.\n\nTim Berners-Lee, then working as a physicist and engineer, recognised in this fragmentation something deeper than technical inconvenience: an obstacle to the exchange of ideas. He proposed a simple remedy: a way for documents on different computers to be linked together, addressed through common rules, and retrieved by anyone connected to the network. The means were spare—uniform addresses, shared protocols, plain documents.\n\nAt the time, the prevailing logic was clear. New technologies were enclosed, patented, licensed. They became assets, and then territories. This approach had shaped much of the modern world, and often served it well. But Berners-Lee declined it. He did not claim ownership of the Web, nor place it behind fees or permissions. Instead, he released its protocols openly, allowing anyone to use and build upon them.\n\nThe decision appeared almost administrative. In retrospect, it was decisive. A system intended to connect the world could not begin by demanding entry. By refusing to own the Web, Berners-Lee allowed it to function as neutral ground — a public space without a gatekeeper.\n\nClark once described courtesy as the discipline by which we restrain our own claims in order to make room for others. In this sense, the Web was an act of courtesy expressed in technology. Its enduring power lies as much in its refusals as in its capabilities.\n\nFrom that restraint flowed much that followed.\n\nIf the Web was founded on an act of courtesy, the system that made it durable was built on something more bracing: an uncompromising respect for how things actually work.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Linus Torvalds, then a student at the University of Helsinki, began writing the core of an operating system. The impulse was practical rather than ideological. His professor, Andrew S. Tanenbaum, had created MINIX—an elegant, Unix-inspired teaching system—so that students could study the anatomy of an operating system. But MINIX was not intended for everyday use, and it did not run on Torvalds’s own machine in the way he required.\n\nOut of a mixture of curiosity and irritation, he decided to build something that would.\n\nWhat is striking, even in hindsight, is how complete that decision already was. The earliest public release of Linux was not a sketch or a manifesto. It was a working kernel: multitasking, memory-managed, architecturally coherent. It revealed, from the outset, a deep and practical understanding of how operating systems behave under real constraints. Authority, in this case, did not need to be asserted. It was visible in the code.\n\nWhen the system reached a point where others might find it useful, Torvalds released it with a plain invitation: use it, improve it, tell me what breaks.\n\nThere was no manifesto and no appeal to higher ideals. There was simply work to be done.\n\nHe did not come to this characteristic pragmatism from a vacuum. He had begun programming at the age of eleven, and grew up in a household where intellectual argument was neither rare nor intimidating. His parents were journalists, his grandfather a statistician. Ideas, facts, and disagreement were part of ordinary conversation, not marks of authority.\n\nHe was named, with ambiguity, after the scientist and peace activist Linus Pauling—or, as he later remarked, perhaps equally after the Linus from Peanuts. The joke is revealing. It suggests a temperament comfortable with seriousness, but resistant to solemnity; respectful of ideas, but impatient with reverence.\n\nThat impatience would become legendary. Torvalds was blunt, intolerant of sloppy reasoning, and openly dismissive of work that failed to meet clear standards. In another setting, such a manner might have proved destructive. In this one, it served a clarifying purpose.\n\nWhat emerged around Linux surprised almost everyone. Programmers from across the world began to contribute—not because they were commanded to, and not because they were paid, but because the standards were unmistakable and the results visible. Authority arose where competence was demonstrated. Disputes were frequent, sometimes fierce, but they were settled not by rank, but by the quality of the work itself.\n\nLinux showed that order need not depend on hierarchy. It could arise from shared standards, rigorous review, and a willingness to reject what did not meet them. The collaboration endured not because everyone agreed, but because disagreement was channelled into improvement rather than paralysis.\n\nToday, the result of that discipline is so pervasive that it has become effectively invisible. Linux runs the watch on a wrist and the rocket in the void; it governs the flow of global finance and the monitors of intensive care. The banker, the surgeon, and the statesman rely upon it every second of their lives, yet few could name it—or the man who began it. It has become the silent, universal substrate of modern civilisation.\n\nAs the project grew, a new problem appeared. The accumulation of changes—branching paths, conflicting versions, overlapping experiments—threatened to overwhelm its own history. Torvalds’s response was direct. He built a tool to address the problem properly, from first principles, in a matter of days.\n\nIt is an obstinate word for an obstinate tool. Torvalds explained the choice with a certain wry self-knowledge: “I’m an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself.” This joke was a refusal to pretend otherwise.\n\nGit altered the way collective memory was handled. Instead of a single, authorised record guarded at the centre, it allowed every participant to hold a complete and inspectable history. Experiments could diverge without endangering the whole, and failures could be acknowledged without erasure. Continuity was preserved without supervision, and responsibility without humiliation.\n\nIn civilisational terms, this was no small matter. Git provided what large institutions have always struggled to maintain: a reliable memory that tolerates error while remaining accountable. It made cooperation at scale possible, and more importantly, sustainable.\n\nTorvalds rarely spoke of these achievements in elevated language, and perhaps that is part of their strength. He distrusted abstraction and disliked ceremony. Yet through an insistence on standards—sometimes uncomfortable, often demanding—he demonstrated that order can emerge without command.\n\nIf Berners-Lee’s restraint made room for others to enter, Torvalds’s discipline made it possible for them to stay—and to build.\n\nWe have spoken of individuals, but civilisation does not advance by solitary effort alone. Ideas endure only when they are taken up, tested, corrected, and carried forward by others. What followed the release of the Web and Linux was therefore not an anomaly, but an ascent — collective, distributed, and largely unplanned.\n\nOut of this discipline grew structures capable of sustaining effort at scale. Organisations such as the Linux Foundation, the Apache Software Foundation, and the Eclipse Foundation did not command creativity so much as shelter it—providing neutral ground where competing firms, independent developers, and public institutions could collaborate without surrendering control to any single interest.\n\nThese great foundations, joined by a constellation of individual efforts, quietly became both the backbone and the surface of the modern world. They supplied the invisible servers and operating systems upon which industry depends, extending that order to the programming languages, development tools, and utility applications that weave through the texture of daily life.\n\nEarlier civilisations had known voluntary scholarship and shared intellectual purpose. What they lacked were the means to sustain such efforts beyond a narrow elite. The Republic of Letters relied on slow correspondence and fragile memory. Here, by contrast, the technical conditions had fallen into place. The Web offered a common space of address; Git provided a disciplined way to coordinate distributed work while preserving the history of every path taken; and systems like Linux supplied a stable, universal substrate at the machine level.\n\nTogether, these tools did not create generosity — but they gave it form, continuity, and reach. Contribution could be preserved rather than lost, disagreement recorded rather than erased, and improvement accumulated without dissolving into chaos. For the first time, cooperation among strangers could be both rigorous and durable.\n\nWhat emerged was neither a utopia nor a rebellion against institutions. It was a practice — demanding, sometimes severe, but remarkably productive. Authority arose where competence was demonstrated, and responsibility where work was accepted. In this way, the invisible commons acquired not only energy, but memory.\n\nIt was a modest beginning, and an unfinished one. But it marked something new in the history of civilisation: a means by which collective effort could outlast enthusiasm, survive disagreement, and leave behind structures strong enough to build upon.\n\nA way, at last, toward permanence.\n\nCivilisations have always faltered not for lack of knowledge, but for lack of finding it. The great library of Alexandria held its wealth in scrolls; the digital commons held it in billions of fragments, scattered and multiplying. The crisis was one of orientation.\n\nIt required a particular kind of genius to address this: not the genius of the poet, who creates new worlds, but the genius of the librarian, who imposes order upon the old.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, then students at Stanford University,approached this problem with an engineer’s impatience with chaos. They recognised that within the tangled mess of the Web, there lay a hidden structure. Links were more than mere decorations; they were judgments. Every reference implied trust, relevance, and attention. If these signals could be measured, the cacophony of human knowledge might order itself, without the need for a central censor.\n\nPage and Brin set out to implement this theory with their own hands. Much of the early system—from the crawling of pages to the ranking of results—was coded by them, tested against the crushing weight of the real Web, and refined through sleepless nights. Their authority rested on a simple, undeniable premise: they had made the thing work.\n\nTheir ambition, expressed with an engineer’s disarming simplicity, was among the broadest in human history:\n\nBasically, our goal is to organize the world’s information and to make it universally accessible and useful.\n\nFew statements have carried such consequence with so little ornament.\n\nWhat emerged was more profound than a commercial search engine — and more consequential than its creators could fully foresee. It was a new cognitive infrastructure, the likes of which had never existed. Questions that once required travel, training, or immense patience could now be answered in moments. Curiosity ceased to be a privilege of the leisured class. It became a habit of the multitude.\n\nThe organisation they built, Google, quickly outgrew its original function. To organise the world’s information at planetary scale required inventions far beyond indexing. It required a new kind of architecture: distributed computation, fault-tolerant systems, and coordination at unprecedented scale. In solving its own problems, Google was forced to become a builder of new civic infrastructure.\n\nHere, the spirit of the commons reasserted itself in an unexpected form. Having built their edifice upon the open foundations of Linux, Page and Brin began to return the scaffolding to the world. They released Android, placing a general-purpose operating system into billions of hands; they gifted Kubernetes, providing a common language for managing complexity across industries.\n\nThese were acts of calculated necessity. They understood that no single organisation—not even one as vast as theirs—could sustain such complex systems alone.\n\nThis created a productive tension. Google became both a citadel of proprietary power and a primary engine of open infrastructure. It demonstrated that in the modern age, collaboration is more than an ideal; it is a structural necessity.\n\nSuch power inevitably casts shadows. To control the map is to influence how others move, and the risks of such centralisation are real. Yet the original impulse remains unmistakable: a belief that knowledge, once organised, should belong to everyone — and that the tools required to manage this complexity should not be locked behind walls.\n\nPage and Brin belong, in Clark’s sense, among the God-given geniuses who realised their own ambitious visions. They recognised a crisis of confusion in the civilisational record, and with their own craft, built a working answer.\n\nCuriosity, once given structure, became infrastructure.\n\nWhat followed would test how the use of such infrastructure should be judged — and at what human cost.\n\nIf the story ended with the triumph of the Web and the ordering of the map, we might be tempted to call it a victory. But history suggests otherwise. When the pace of civilisation accelerates, it often leaves its institutions behind. And in that widening gap, there are casualties.\n\nAaron Swartz stood squarely in that gap.\n\nBorn in 1986 near Chicago, Swartz was a prodigy, a builder, and — in a deeper sense — a conscience. He belonged naturally to the world of the commons we have been describing, fluent in its technical languages and serious about its moral claims. For him, openness was a principle to be acted upon.\n\nHis contributions began with something deceptively modest. He helped create Markdown, a syntax that appears, at first glance, to be nothing more than plain text. Yet this simplicity was a philosophical choice. By stripping away the complex, fragile interfaces of modern word processing, Markdown liberated the writer to focus on the hierarchy of ideas rather than their ornamentation. It restored a necessary discipline to the act of writing, ensuring that the structure of an argument remained visible, honest, and distinct from its display.\n\nBut the implications of this choice extended far beyond the quiet of the study. Swartz understood that for knowledge to endure, it must be separable from the tools used to create it. Because Markdown treated text as structured data, a document was no longer a dead artifact, but an active component of a system. A specification written in this way could be transformed, by the simplest of scripts, into a website, a technical manual, or even executable code. It opened the way for streamlining the chaotic passage from abstract policy to concrete production, creating an unbroken chain between intention and execution.\n\nIn this sense, Markdown pointed toward a form of civic legibility: a way in which the vast records of society—its laws, its data, its history—might remain intelligible to both human eyes and machine logic, safe from the rot of proprietary obsolescence. It was a small tool, but it became the essential mortar for a civilisation built on code.\n\nBut Swartz’s concern for access did not end with tools. He saw that while the machinery of the commons had become open, many of the great storehouses of human knowledge remained closed. Scholarly research — much of it publicly funded — was locked behind paywalls, accessible primarily to those already inside the gates. To Swartz, this inefficiency rose to the level of moral error.\n\nHis response was literal and uncompromising. In 2011, he attempted to make available a large body of academic work, not for profit, but as an assertion of principle. It was an act of civil disobedience, closer in spirit to the old librarians than to the modern hacker stereotype. Where the digital world saw a custodian of knowledge, the institution saw a violator of rules.\n\nThe collision was severe. Swartz encountered a legal and prosecutorial machinery calibrated for deterrence rather than judgment, and example rather than proportion. The weight of the response far exceeded the scale of the act. What followed is well known, and remains difficult to contemplate.\n\nIt would be easy, at this point, to simplify the story — to assign villains and heroes, to turn tragedy into rhetoric. That would be a mistake. The institutions acted from procedure, Swartz from conviction. What failed here was something more elusive: a shared understanding of how ideals, once embedded in technology, should be reflected in law.\n\nClark once insisted that civilisation depends not only on knowledge, but on sympathy — on the capacity to recognise ourselves in others. The tragedy took the form of a collision: between a commons that had learned to move, and institutions that had not yet learned how to follow. Swartz’s life and death force an uncomfortable question: whether a society that builds its future on openness can afford to treat its most literal adherents as adversaries.\n\nHis story marks the point at which the invisible commons ceased to be merely a technical achievement, and became a moral test. It revealed that access, order, and power cannot be aligned by engineering alone. They require judgment and restraint — and, above all, a sense of proportion.\n\nIn the years that followed, the shock of this failure was not entirely absorbed in silence. Laws were re-examined, prosecutorial practices questioned, and the assumption that access could be criminalised without consequence began, slowly, to weaken. Institutions did not become wiser overnight — but they became more aware.\n\nCivilisation learns unevenly, and often at great cost — usually after the fact. Its progress has rarely depended on perfect obedience, and still less on moral comfort. Again and again, it has been forced forward by individuals willing to test the distance between what is lawful and what is just — and to bear the consequences of that test.\n\nAny consolation that remains lies in memory. Swartz’s insistence did not vanish with him. It entered the moral consciousness of the commons itself, where future generations may yet recognise that law, like technology, cannot remain untouched by human consequence.\n\nIn February 2025, a bust of Aaron Swartz was unveiled in the lobby of the Internet Archive in San Francisco — an institution dedicated to preserving the world’s knowledge and keeping it accessible. Its placement is telling: among readers, archives, and use, rather than courts or seats of power. It marks no victory, announces no verdict, and offers no absolution.\n\nIt simply reminds those who pass beneath it that the commons was not built by compliance alone — and that civilisation, if it is to endure, must always leave room for conscience to speak before the law has learned how to listen.\n\nAfter the moral strain of collision, it is necessary to return to first principles — this time of learning itself. Civilisation, after all, is not preserved by systems alone. It is preserved by transmission: by one mind taking the time to explain something carefully to another.\n\nIn 2004, Sal Khan began without a grand design to reform education. He was tutoring a cousin through the web. The subject was mathematics, and the medium he chose was austere: a black screen, a trail of coloured digital ink, and a voice. This created an aesthetic of pure concentration. The learner watched the thought itself unfolding in real time. Unencumbered by institutional theories or the language of disruption, the work relied entirely on the clarity of the explanation.\n\nFrom this modest beginning grew Khan Academy — an online platform that functioned as a repository of patience. Its distinguishing quality lay in its tone. Concepts were broken down slowly, without embarrassment, and rebuilt step by step, treating the learner simply as an unfinished mind requiring only time and method to complete itself.\n\nThis approach addressed a failure that Clark had observed long before. He remarked that the so-called “top people” of earlier generations were often charming but poorly informed, while students in provincial universities were sharper, more curious, and more alert. The barrier between them was access—specifically, access to explanation.\n\nKhan Academy demonstrated that high culture could be shared in its full complexity. Calculus, physics, economics, and history could be made intelligible while remaining rigorous. Explanation, when offered with care, became a form of respect.\n\nHere, the tools of the invisible commons reached their most humane expression. The Web provided reach; search made discovery possible; open infrastructure kept costs low. Yet the motive force was the act of explanation itself. The teacher stood alongside the learner, treating the student as a capable mind, and making learning an act of invitation rather than one of ranking, filtering, or exclusion. This restoration of dignity remains one of the most consequential achievements of the digital age.\n\nIt is striking that a platform of this global reach and massive utility was founded on a single voice, repeated patiently thousands of times. Even as the project expanded, it retained this intimacy. While traditional schools carry responsibilities far beyond explanation, Khan proved that the continuity of knowledge operates independently of hierarchy. It advances most reliably where the responsibility for clarity is personal, continuous, and owned by a human voice.\n\nIn the end, his contribution reminds us of a truth often obscured by scale and abstraction: that alongside genius and conscience, civilisation depends upon explanation—offered freely, received humbly, and carried forward, one mind at a time.\n\nWe have traced a lineage defined less by doctrine than by a series of human gestures: restraint at the beginning, discipline in the making, generosity in collaboration, conscience under strain, and patience in explanation. Taken together, they suggest that the digital age grew around a distinct, if quiet, centre.\n\nThat centre resides beyond the reach of institutions, ideologies, or markets. It lives in a set of practices—ways of working, judging, and explaining—through which knowledge is made durable and meaning carried forward. They are largely invisible, easily neglected, yet without them the energy of an age leaves nothing that lasts.\n\nCivilisation, as Clark understood, is defined by what it chooses to preserve. Permanence emerges through restraint; through the refusal to enclose what could be enclosed; through standards maintained without command; through explanations offered again, for the sake of someone still learning. Far from the habits of conquest, these are the gestures by which civilisation endures.\n\nYet they remain fragile. Tools may embody values, yet judgment cannot be automated. Institutions can preserve order, yet adaptation lags behind change. Genius may illuminate a path, yet sympathy and proportion determine how far that path can be followed. Again and again, endurance depends less on intelligence than on moral habit.\n\nThe digital world now shapes how we learn, how we work, how we remember, and how we judge one another. Whether it will lift civilisation — or merely accelerate it — remains an open question. The answer lies in the care with which these systems are used, extended, and restrained.\n\nCivilisation has always been a provisional achievement. It must be built, maintained, and renewed by each generation. The invisible commons will endure only if it is treated as a trust.\n\nAnd that, perhaps, is the measure of our moment: not whether we can build systems of astonishing complexity, but whether we can give them the forms, the sympathy, and the permanence required to make them worthy of civilisation itself.",

    "description": "An exploration in using Passkeys as generalized cryptographic seed material to address new use cases, while inheriting the benefits of cross-device synced keys with native biomentric UX.",
    "fullText": "In my time at Microsoft, I worked on the team responsible for the development and standardization of Passkeys. Passkeys have made standard, secure, cryptographic authentication accessible to all users, but the model is tightly restricted to website/app login.\n\nEven with a deep, code-level understanding of passkeys and WebAuthn, it wasn’t until now, six years later, that I realized a set of properties and behaviors present within Passkeys could be hijacked to make this post possible. This ‘feature’ was sitting right there and feels so obvious in retrospect. It just goes to show if you remain curious and turn over every rock, you can bend technology to do new and interesting things.\n\nPassSeeds is a hack that explores this question: can we hijack the capabilities and UX of passkeys for use cases that stretch beyond their rigid login model and limited key-type support? The status quo of many Web-based use cases involving long-held cryptographic keys is often users pasting key material into sites/apps or buying special hardware devices that are difficult for less technical folks to use.\n\nTo understand PassSeeds, it helps to have some awareness of the underlying Passkey technology they are based on.\n\nPasskeys are asymmetric key pairs formatted as WebAuthn credentials, typically used to replace passwords for website logins. A key pair is created on the user’s device for a website and stored in a secure hardware module. Access to and usage of these key pairs is scoped to the origin of the site they were created on (for example: example.com, other.example.com, test.com). Passkeys are replicated across a user’s devices by the platform (iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager, Windows Hello, etc.) via an end-to-end encrypted sync process. Below is a basic overview of the two primary UX flows for generating a passkey and using one for login:\n\nThere are several attributes of Passkeys to keep in mind that are critical to the PassSeed mechanism detailed in this post:\n\nGiven these attributes of the Passkey model, even public keys in the system behave like a natively provisioned, hardware-secured, synced secret, even though cryptography does not require them to be secret. This is a rare and valuable set of properties many products, services, and protocols find highly desirable.\n\nPasskeys provide biometrically gated use of cryptographic keys, but they were created specifically for authentication signing in centralized website login flows. Meanwhile, web apps that need cryptographic material and curves that passkeys don’t support (secp256k1 for Bitcoin, BLS12-381 for ZKPs, etc.) remain primitive and convoluted. Users copy 12–24 words, stash JSON keystores, or paste raw keys across apps. PassSeeds introduces a novel approach: treat the passkey’s P‑256 public key itself as seed material and retrieve it on demand through ECDSA public‑key recovery. The authenticator still keeps the private key and user‑verification requirements, but the recovered public‑key bytes become the deterministic PassSeed that can serve as the foundation for other cryptographic use cases.\n\n(If you don’t want to understand how it works, you can skip to the DEMO)\n\nAssumptions: you have created a passkey, did not export the public key anywhere at generation time, and do not allow any signatures from the passkey outside of the generating origin’s local boundary.\n\nRegeneration via ECDSA Key Recovery\n\nRecovery / Rotation\n\nIf a device is lost, but other devices with the passkey that backs the PassSeed are still available, any new device added to the accout of the user will have their PassSeed automatically synced upon device enrollment, which is a process handled by the native platform. If all devices with the backing passkey are lost, you can still access and control whatever was tied to your PassSeed via the exported mnemonic phrase, if you elected to do that (which is strongly recommeded). Because PassSeeds and their backing Passkeys cannot be imported into the Passkey mechanism, if you lose all devices with the backing Passkey, you will need to transfer anything tied to the old PassSeed to a new one on your active devices (again, assuming you backed up your PassSeed via exporting its mnemonic phrase).\n\nTo make the PassSeed user-friendly, the implementation converts the 32-byte PassSeed into a standard BIP-39 mnemonic. In practice, the PassSeed is the SHA-256 hash of the recovered public key, represented as 32 bytes. Users can write down the phrase to ensure that even if something happens to their PassSeed (e.g. they accidentially delete it), they can retain access to the keys it is capable of producing. Rerunning the ECDSA recovery process with the same passkey deterministically yields the same phrase.\n\nOnce you have the PassSeed (public key bytes or its mnemonic-derived entropy), you can deterministically derive other cryptographic material:\n\nThe following are the code snippets for the core methods from the PassSeed TypeScript implementation, avaiable in the PassSeed Github repo. Some of the methods reference helpers that are contained in the module, but are not shown here, for brevity.\n\nThis method orchestrates the complete WebAuthn credential creation flow, extracts the credential’s P-256 public key from the CBOR attestation object, and returns a hex-encoded SHA-256 hash of the public key bytes.\n\nThis method retrieves an existing passkey (optionally by credential ID), performs two WebAuthn signatures over the same challenge, reconstructs the public key via ECDSA recovery by intersecting candidate points from both signatures, and returns the hex-encoded PassSeed string.\n\nThis method converts a 32-byte PassSeed (as bytes or hex) into a human-readable BIP-39 mnemonic phrase for backup and recovery, optionally truncating to 16 bytes for a 12-word phrase before handing entropy to bip39.entropyToMnemonic with the English wordlist.\n\nThe authenticator still enforces RP binding and user verification before issuing signatures, so phishing resistance mirrors standard passkeys. The host page sees two signatures and the recovered public key, values one must assume the host can exfiltrate. Because the same message is signed twice, replay risk is mitigated by including nonces, RP ID, and a strict prefix so signatures cannot be repurposed. Syncable passkeys inherit the platform’s end-to-end encrypted sync features.\n\nThe WebAuthn specification has defined a PRF extension for deterministically generating per-credential secrets, and a Large Blob extension, which can be used to encrypt and save a randomly generated secret that is synced across the user’s devices, both of which could achieve the desired ends. The problem is API support: PRF and Large Blob features are not implemented across browsers today, and there is no signal that either will be in the near future. That makes it hard to rely on in production if you need your app to work everywhere.\n\nPassSeeds can even be used to create a polyfill for the PRF feature: by deterministically recovering a stable cryptographic value from the passkey signature flow (the public key), you can use that value to generate deterministic, cryptographic values based on input values, which will regenerate the same value for the same input, every time. If the tradeoffs of PassSeeds are acceptable, you can integrate PRF-reliant use cases in apps today, across all browsers. I plan on writing a PRF polyfill soon, so stay tuned.\n\nThe following is a demo page that allows you to create PassSeeds, reload the page to test regeneration (via the ECDSA recovery process), and view the Mnemonic phrase of PassSeeds you’ve created: PassSeeds Demo\n\nYou can also include PassSeeds in your Web apps via NPM: PassSeeds NPM Package",

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — Pamela Smart, who is serving life in prison for orchestrating the murder of her husband by her teenage student in 1990, is seeking to overturn her conviction over what her lawyers claim were several constitutional violations.\n\nThe petition for habeas corpus relief was filed Monday in New York, where she is being held at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women, and, in New Hampshire, where the murder happened.\n\n“Ms. Smart’s trial unfolded in an environment that no court had previously confronted — wall-to-wall media coverage that blurred the line between allegation and evidence,” Jason Ott, who is part of Smart’s legal team, said in a statement. “This petition challenges whether a fair adversarial process took place.”\n\nThe move comes about seven months after New Hampshire Gov. Kelly Ayotte rejected a request for a sentence reduction hearing. Ayotte said she reviewed the case and decided it was not deserving of a hearing.\n\nA spokesman for the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision said it would have no comment about the petition.\n\nA spokeman for New Hampshire’s attorney general said it would not comment on pending litigation “other than to note that the State maintains Ms. Smart received a fair trial and that her convictions were lawfully obtained and upheld on appeal.”\n\nIn their petition, lawyers for the 57-year-old Smart argue that prosecutors misled the jury by providing them with inaccurate transcripts of surreptitiously recorded conversations of Ms. Smart that included words that were not audible on the recordings. Among the words they claim weren't audible but in the transcript were the word killed in the sentence “you had your husband killed,\" the word busted in the sentence “I'm gonna be busted\" and the word murder in the sentence “this would have been the perfect murder.”\n\n“Modern science confirms what common sense has always told us: when people are handed a script, they inevitably hear the words they are shown,” Smart’s attorney, Matthew Zernhelt, said in a statement. “Jurors were not evaluating the recordings independently — they were being directed toward a conclusion, and that direction decided the verdict.”\n\nLawyers also argued the conviction should be overturned because the verdict was tainted by the media attention and due to faulty instructions to the jury. They argued jurors were told they must find that Smart acted with premeditation, not told they must consider only evidence presented at trial.\n\nThey also argued the trial court gave her a mandatory life sentence without parole for being an accomplice to first-degree murder, despite New Hampshire not mandating that sentence for the charge.\n\nSmart was a 22-year-old high school media coordinator when she began an affair with a 15-year-old boy who later fatally shot her husband, Gregory Smart, in Derry. The shooter was freed in 2015 after serving a 25-year sentence. Although Smart denied knowledge of the plot, she was convicted of being an accomplice to first-degree murder and other crimes and sentenced to life without parole.\n\nIt took until 2024 for Smart to take full responsibility for her husband’s death. In a video released in June, she said she spent years deflecting blame “almost as if it was a coping mechanism.”\n\nSmart’s trial was a media circus and one of America’s first high-profile cases about a sexual affair between a school employee and a student. The student, William Flynn, testified that Smart told him she needed her husband killed because she feared she would lose everything if they divorced and that she threatened to break up with him if he didn't kill her husband. Flynn and three other teens cooperated with prosecutors and all have since been released.\n\nFlynn and 17-year-old Patrick Randall entered the Smarts’ Derry condominium and forced Gregory Smart to his knees in the foyer. As Randall held a knife to the man’s throat, Flynn fired a hollow-point bullet into his head. Both pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and were sentenced to 28 years to life. They were granted parole in 2015. Two other teenagers served prison sentences and have been released.\n\nThe case inspired Joyce Maynard’s 1992 book “To Die For” and the 1995 film of the same name, starring Nicole Kidman and Joaquin Phoenix.",

    "description": "If you want to doomscroll less this year, try these realistic tips from screen time...",
    "fullText": "If you want to doomscroll less this year, try these realistic tips from screen time coaches\n\nSimple daily rituals for building fun, calm and play into your days in 2026\n\nI wish time travel were real. If it were, I’d go back to 2006 – the year before the release of the first iPhone. A time when doomscrolling didn’t exist, and the thought of a phone call didn’t cause me a rush of anxiety.\n\nAnd many Americans agree. On social media, some are already labeling 2026 “the age of analog”, swapping Spotify for a record player and a smartphone lens for a film camera.\n\nPlenty of advice already exists out there on how to reduce screen time. But we were on the hunt for unique tips that went beyond silencing phone notifications or setting time limits.\n\nI asked for advice from a slew of experts who study addiction and digital detoxing and have written best-selling books on managing screen time (we’ve shared them in a reading list below). From putting a rubber band around your phone to writing a breakup letter to it, below are realistic 15 strategies that might actually help cut down on scrolling.\n\nIf you’re feeling very brave, make sure to read our last (and most vulnerable) tip. Then, at the very end, get some inspiration for screen-free activities from the Filter team.\n\nPower On: Managing Screen Time to Benefit the Whole Family by Ash Brandin\n\nDopamine Nation by Dr Anna Lembke\n\nThe Official Dopamine Nation Workbook by Dr Anna Lembke\n\nHow to Break Up with Your Phone by Catherine Price\n\nThe Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in a High-Tech World by Adam Gazzaley and Dr Larry Rosen\n\nBefore doing anything, view how much you’re currently averaging in your smartphone’s stats.\n\nIt also helps to become mindful of when you choose to pick up your phone – and what you’re feeling at the time. Bored? Stressed? “Sometimes it just helps me to ask: what need is this meeting? What is it I’m seeking? What am I trying to get from this?” said Ash Brandin, an educator and author of Power On.\n\nYou can also try a physical reminder to pause. “One thing I often suggest is that you put a rubber band or a hair tie around your phone for a couple of days,” said health journalist Catherine Price, the author of How to Break Up with Your Phone and The Power of Fun. “When you reach for your phone on autopilot, you think: why is that on my phone?”\n\nYou could set a time limit for using an app, but that often doesn’t work – and can even increase your screen time, according to a study conducted by Dr Jordan Etkin, a Duke University professor who researches how people set goals. Instead, she recommended setting “hard limits”, which means a limit that can’t be changed once set.\n\nTo set a “hard limit”, Price suggested apps such as Opal and Freedom, which allow you to put apps and websites on a “block list” and schedule focus sessions. Freedom (which offers a free trial) also lets you sync multiple devices and offers a “locked” mode to help you resist ending a session early.\n\nThis turns your phone into “a tool that helps you do the things you want to do, that doesn’t suck away at your life”, she said. Price is also a fan of Brick, a physical tool that locks you out of distracting apps of your choosing until you use your phone to unlock them.\n\nIf the mere sight of your phone leaves you with the urge to scroll, try putting it somewhere that makes you have to look for it.\n\n“If you’re at work and you want to focus, keep your phone in your bag or in your jacket,” said Dr Kostadin Kushlev, who has researched the benefits of “digital detoxing” at Georgetown University.\n\nAt night, Price recommended leaving your phone outside of your bedroom and swapping your smartphone’s alarm for a physical alarm clock. (Price’s husband uses this retro table clock.) Otherwise, after seeing all your notifications, “you’re guaranteed that you’re going to start your day on someone else’s terms,” she said.\n\nIf you find yourself doomscrolling in your free time, try taking up a screen-free activity or hobby.\n\n“Make it less about trying to cut back and more about filling our lives with things that we enjoy,” said Price, who enjoys jamming out on the drums in her spare time.\n\nAnd if you aren’t sure where to start, Brandin advised figuring out what purpose your phone is fulfilling and translating it to offline hobbies. For instance, if you resort to task-oriented games such as Candy Crush for a mindless distraction, try a crochet kit.\n\nIt can feel too easy to pick up your phone when you have a free second.\n\nTo make it less convenient to scroll, Lembke advised offloading tempting apps and powering your phone off between uses.\n\nOr if you’re feeling brave, you can take a page from Lembke, who leaves her house without her phone and keeps any necessary apps on her laptop, “so that it’s not quite so accessible and quite so mobile”.\n\nLembke advised turning on “grayscale” mode in your phone’s display settings, which “is a good way to make it less potent”. And if you’re worried that you won’t remember how to switch it back to color, Price has shared how to create an accessibility shortcut that allows you to easily toggle between the two modes.\n\nYou can also try decreasing your algorithm’s power. If you often fall down YouTube rabbit holes, turn off its “recommendations” feature. That way, you have to manually search for every new video, Lembke said.\n\nIf you need a physical reminder of why you’d like to make a change to your screen time, Price advises you to write a “breakup” letter to your phone.\n\n“Truly think about your phone as a partner in a relationship. What do you love about it, but what’s not working? How has it helped you? How is it hurting you?” Price said.\n\nMany of the experts advised taking planned time away from your phone.\n\nDr Larry Rosen, co-author of The Distracted Mind and a research psychologist, recommended “tech breaks”, consisting of two minutes of screen time, followed by 15 to 30 minutes of focused, distraction-free work. “Then you’re controlling the break,” he said.\n\nIf you’re up for a challenge, you can also try taking an extended break. “You do feel better,” Lembke said. It also forces you to connect with people in your life. “In the face of boredom and discomfort, people typically reach out to other people.”\n\nIf you don’t want to go without a smartphone completely, try swapping with a loved one.\n\nOn the weekends, Etkin, the Duke professor, trades phones with her partner. “That way we can get a hold of each other if we need to, and we could check something if we need to. But we can’t be on our own media streams,” she said.\n\nLooking for more tips? Consider subscribing to the Guardian’s Reclaim your brain newsletter for more ways to reduce your screen time in 2026.\n\nRecently, I’ve been trying a whole slew of hobbies to replace scrolling on TikTok. A few of my favorites are watercoloring and reading on my Kindle. And despite the chilly weather, I love going for a run. I also asked my Filter colleagues about screen-free things they liked to do, and here’s what they said.\n\nNick Mokey, Filter editor: Now that I work from home, I actually miss the days of commuting into an office by bike every day, and I find myself inventing excuses to run errands on two wheels: buying groceries, getting a haircut, meeting friends for a beer.\n\nI’ve never arrived anywhere in a worse mood after biking there, and when I catch clear skies in the winter, a bike commute can become the highlight of an otherwise mundane day. With both no screen and no earbuds for safety, it’s a total disconnect from all things digital.\n\nKaren Yuan, Filter US commissioning editor: Is it a cop-out to say my favorite screen-free activity is taking a walk? Especially very long walks.\n\nA couple years ago, I fell in love with solo backpacking, and since then I’ve hiked through forests and dirt roads in Spain, France and Japan with my trusty Osprey Mira 32L. I love taking these walking tours of new places because they force me to just take in and enjoy what’s around me.\n\nAnd because I can’t always up and leave my everyday life, I try to keep that mindset at home, too – by taking long evening walks around my Brooklyn neighborhood that help me view all my familiar sights anew.",

A 0→1 builder who doesn’t just ideate, but ships. You’ll create great content, run scrappy experiments, and build product growth loops that compound. This is a hands-on role: you’ll set strategy, execute a rapid experiment cadence, measure results, and turn wins into repeatable playbooks.\n\nYou’ll focus primarily on non-advertising channels: organic social, influencer/creator collaborations, channel partners, and product growth loops.

Bonus points for mentioning other companies and campaigns you think are relevant.\n\nOur founders met while building competing consumer startups. We launched multiple products across consumer and SaaS and talked to thousands of fans and creators in the process. In 2020, we realized one of the biggest pain points artists and events face is actually driving their audience from socials into their own CRM.\n\nIn 2020, we joined Y Combinator’s summer batch and began building a product that quickly gained strong early traction. We raised from top-tier investors like Eldridge and Sony and have since grown into a team of 24 exceptional individuals spanning product, sales, and operations.\n\nWe have a strong written documentation culture. We try to do as much as possible asynchronously to move quickly and efficiently. We have a daily 30 minute standup and team-specific meetings throughout the week.",

    "fullText": "As Venezuelans attempt to regain a semblance of normalcy after the US capture of President Nicolás Maduro, authorities in the country are cracking down on any show of support to the beleaguered leader’s removal.\n\nAs Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as Venezuela’s acting leader on Monday, rights group warned of escalating repression, with checkpoints being erected around the country, amid reports of price gouging and growing hunger.\n\nOfficials imposed a decree on Monday, which grants broad powers to the presidency and orders security forces to capture “any person involved in the promotion or support” of the weekend attack by the US.\n\nThat same day, Venezuelan security forces temporarily detained 14 journalists, including reporters who were covering the swearing-in of the country’s national assembly, according to the national press union. No explanation was given for their detention.\n\nIt also emerged that political prisoners had their visiting rights suspended and are being prevented from communicating with the outside world, according to the Committee for the Liberation of Political Prisoners in Venezuela.\n\nThe committee added that checkpoints have been going up in cities around the country, with people being searched and detained for possessing “digital material” linked to the US military action.\n\nVenezuela’s Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello posted two videos on Instagram showing security forces in the capital. In one video, a group of armed men can be heard shouting: “Loyal always, traitors never!”\n\nSilence and anxiety grip the capital Caracas, caused by the shock of the January 3 attack and the fear of the government’s heavy-handed response.\n\nThere is still a heavy police presence in Caracas, even if there are fewer soldiers patrolling the streets.\n\nThere has been little sign of public dissent or even anti-government posts on social media. The fear of reprisal looms large under a regime notorious for punishing dissent, especially given the officials in charge of past crackdowns, Cabello and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López, remain in their roles.\n\nSince Sunday, pro-government groups have taken to the streets to demand the release of Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores. But these types of demonstrations have been limited in size and scope.\n\nEven in the face of uncertainty, Venezuelans seem ready to move forward.\n\nMore civilians were seen milling out on the streets of Caracas today. Public offices are operating, the Metro is running, the nearby airport is receiving domestic flights, and supermarkets are still selling produce to customers.\n\nSome services are not yet operating at full capacity, due in part to a public holiday, Día de los Reyes (Three Kings’ Day), which has kept many at home.\n\nBut over the next few days, schools are due to reopen, and employees are expected to report back to work full-time. Padrino López told people Sunday to “resume their economic activities, work, and all other types of activities, including educational activities, in the coming days.”\n\nThe government’s focus seems to be shifting toward restarting the economy, which has been flashing warning signs this week.\n\nVenezuela’s currency, the Bolívar, has suffered a sharp devaluation. Yesterday, there were areas in the city of Maracaibo where stores and shops only accepted cash, and the exchange rate was 900 to 1,000 Bolívares to the US dollar (it is normally around 300).\n\nAmid reports of price gouging, some shelves across the country have started to empty.\n\nReports of hunger are relentless in areas farther from the city. In the east of the country, businesses in smaller cities have removed prices altogether.\n\nThe challenges plaguing the country are abundant. But Venezuelans, having endured years of crises, know how to tackle adversity.\n\nCaracas merchant Douglas Sanchez told Reuters Monday that in the midst of the chaos and desperation, “those of us who work day to day, who eat day to day” have to keep making money. “Because if you don’t go out to work, you don’t have anything.”\n\nCNN’s Jack Guy, Gonzalo Zegarra and Germán Padinger contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "An El Paso high school graduate was remembered for having the \"kindest soul, a beautiful smile, and a heart that cared deeply for everyone\" after she was killed by a driver who allegedly ran a red light, marking El Paso's first traffic-related death of 2026.\n\nAngelique Diaz De Leon, 18, died as she was a passenger in a 2013 Chevrolet Camaro that was hit by a 2023 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck about 2 a.m. on Thursday, Jan.1, on Gateway North Boulevard and Sean Haggerty Drive in the Northeast, El Paso Police Department spokesman Officer Adrian Cisneros said in a news release.\n\nOfficers responding to a two-vehicle crash found Diaz De Leon dead at the scene. An investigation revealed the Silverado driven by 48-year-old Abel Garcia of Chaparral, New Mexico, allegedly failed to stop at a red light and t-boned the Camaro, the news release states.\n\n\"On January 1, 2026, our family lost a piece of our hearts,\" her family wrote on a GoFundMe page. \"Our beautiful Angelique was taken from us far too soon and our world will never be the same without her.\n\n\"Angelique is pure love. She had the kindest soul, a beautiful smile, and a heart that cared deeply for everyone around her. She was smart beyond her years, funny without even trying, and never held anger in her heart. She always helped us, always showed up, and always gave more love than she ever asked for in return.\"\n\nNicholas Jasay Ramirez, 19, of Chaparral, was driving the Camaro and suffered minor injuries. He was taken to a hospital for treatment.\n\nEl Paso police investigators determined that Garcia's failure to stop at the red light was the contributing factor to the wreck. Alcohol is also suspected as a contributing factor, police said, but no further information was released on whether Garcia is facing criminal charges. He is not listed in jail records as of Tuesday, Jan. 6.\n\nEl Paso Independent School District's Transmountain Early College High School officials posted a statement on their website stating Diaz De Leon \"was traveling home when an intoxicated driver collided with the vehicle she was in.\"\n\nDiaz De Leon graduated as part of the early college's Spring class of 2025.\n\n\"Angelique joined TMECHS after applying in the Fall of 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" the statement said. \"She returned to campus at a time filled with uncertainty and became part of the first group of students to attend the in-person Summer Bridge program in Summer 2021. From the beginning, she showed determination, focus, and resilience as she worked toward earning both her high school diploma and an Associate of Science degree.\"\n\nMore: 1 person dies in El Paso's first reported fatal crash of 2026\n\nShe was remembered as a hard worker who was always helping her fellow students.\n\n\"Angelique carried a strong work ethic throughout her years at TMECHS,\" the statement said. \"She supported her peers, stepped up when others needed help, and treated those around her with care and respect. Students and staff knew her as dependable, kind, and uplifting. She brought light to our campus.\n\n\"She embraced the academic rigor of the early college program. Angelique completed four years of high school coursework while taking college classes at El Paso Community College. In Spring 2025, she graduated from both EPCC and TMECHS, earning her associate degree and high school diploma.\"\n\nDiaz De Leon enrolled at Pima Medical Institute, where she planned to pursue a career in occupational therapy, the statement said.\n\n\"We honor Angelique,\" the statement ends. \"We remember her.

He has also spoken up when he believes lawyers are not ⁠best serving their clients.\n\nIn a 2013 law review article, ‌he wrote that some lawyers were \"outraged\" and accused him of \"arrogation of power\" when he rejected a $675 million settlement negotiated between New York City and injured first responders who raced to the World Trade Center after the attacks of ‍September 11, 2001.\n\nHellerstein concluded that, while no statute or rule clearly addressed whether the deal needed his blessing, he had inherent authority to reject it as inadequate.\n\nThe attorneys ended up presenting Hellerstein with a new settlement that added $125 million for victims.\n\nHellerstein \"is a man of strongly held convictions and he seeks to find a way to harmonize ​the law with his understanding of justice,\" said Mitchell Epner, a former federal prosecutor who has observed Hellerstein on the bench.\n\nHellerstein has spoken ‌candidly about how his Jewish values affect his decision-making.\n\n\"As a judge, and as a Jew, I consider that everything I do reflects God and affects His image,\" he wrote in the 2013 article.\n\nIn the 2020 podcast, Hellerstein said he believes he was \"the first Orthodox boy employed by a gentile or Jewish firm in New York City.\"\n\n\"I'm pleased to say that after me there were others, and some credited me with having broken the precedent,\" Hellerstein said.\n\nHellerstein already had a long career before President Bill Clinton nominated him to the federal bench in 1998.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1960, Hellerstein served in the ⁠Judge Advocate General's Corps, the legal arm of the United States Army.\n\nIn 1960, Hellerstein ​joined the now-defunct firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, where he ended up practicing for much ​of his career.\n\nA HISTORY OF REBUKING TRUMP'S LEGAL GAMBITS\n\nIn a high-profile case in 2020, Hellerstein ordered the release of former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen, after Trump's Justice Department tried to revoke his home confinement and return him to jail.\n\nHellerstein ‍concluded Trump's administration was retaliating against Cohen ⁠for writing a book.\n\nIn 2023, Hellerstein denied a request by Trump to move to federal court his New York criminal case relating to a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Trump was tried in state court and found guilty of 34 felony ⁠counts.\n\nIn May 2025, Hellerstein rejected an effort by the Trump administration to use a wartime law to send alleged gang members to Venezuela, saying the men had been improperly denied ‌their day in court.\n\n“This is the United States of America,\" he said. \"People are being thrown out of the country because of ‌their tattoos.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Republicans must win the 2026 midterm elections or else he will get impeached by Democrats.\n\n\"You gotta win the midterms 'cause, if we don't win the midterms, it's just gonna be - I mean, they'll find a reason to impeach me,\" Trump said at a retreat for House Republican lawmakers in Washington. \"I'll get impeached.\"\n\nThe president urged his fellow Republicans to fight in a more unified fashion on issues ranging from gender politics to healthcare and election reforms, and to sell his policies to a public angry about cost of living issues.\n\nTrump's agenda is on the line in November's elections, when all the seats in the House of Representatives and a third of the Senate's seats will be contested.\n\nDuring the speech, Trump predicted an epic win for Republicans in the elections but also expressed concerns about historical precedent that the party of the sitting president usually fares poorly.\n\n\"They say that when you win the presidency, you lose the midterm,\" Trump said at the Kennedy Center, a Washington performing arts center that was recently renamed to include a mention of Trump. \"I wish you could explain to me what the hell's going on with the mind of the public,\" Trump said.\n\nHouse Republicans have shown enormous deference to Trump so far, ceding much of Congress' authority over spending and other matters to his administration. But they have started to show glimmers of independence. The House could vote this week to override a veto Trump issued last month that canceled water projects in Colorado and Utah, though it is not clear whether the effort will get the two-thirds majority needed.\n\nTrump was impeached twice by the Democratic-led House of Representatives during his 2017-2021 term in office, faulting him for what they said were abuses of power involving Ukraine and ahead of the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. The Republican-controlled Senate voted to acquit him in both cases.\n\nReporting by Steve Holland, Trevor Hunnicutt, Bo Erickson, Andy Sullivan and Richard Cowan, Editing by Franklin Paul and Alistair Bell",

    "fullText": "It's only been days since an audacious U.S. raid snatched Nicolás Maduro from a Venezuelan military base and sped him to a Brooklyn prison, yet Detroit-area Trump supporter Aaron Tobin can already see it all playing out on the big screen.\n\nIt'll be the subject of movies for years to come, he predicts. “I am thrilled.” Plenty of others who voted for President Donald Trump and spoke to The Associated Press about the raid are applauding, too — at least for now.\n\nThe seizure of Venezuela's authoritarian leader and his wife has forced another reckoning on the “Make America Great Again” coalition, already rocked by the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files and strained by rising health insurance premiums and living costs.\n\nTrump promised his voters that “America First” would stand against more foreign entanglements. Instead, he intervened with force and without congressional approval in a new frontier, a South American capital so far from Washington that Google Maps says it “can't seem to find a way there.”\n\nThe geopolitical action film that Tobin sees in his mind is only at its opening scene, before all the complexities of uprooting a foreign government by a U.S. president's fiat come rushing in. U.S. forces entered and exited swiftly. But what happens next?\n\nTrump finds early but not endless support\n\nEarly on, the pushback from congressional Republicans and Trump's core constituencies has been guarded, in contrast to their uproar over the Epstein episode or the tensions coursing through Republican politics over the now-expired health insurance subsidies.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Trump voters interviewed by AP journalists around the country praised the operation and expressed faith in Trump's course. But not always limitless faith. They did not all back up Trump's claim that those who “voted for me are thrilled. They said, ‘This is what we voted for.’”\n\n“I support him so far,” Paul Bonner, 67, told AP while browsing at a Trump merchandise store in Bensalem, Pennsylvania. “Until he messes up, I support him.”\n\nTrump's apparent willingness to stay involved in Venezuela and his intensifying rhetoric about expanding U.S. power elsewhere in the hemisphere are making some of his die-hard supporters nervous.\n\nNot all of them are reaching for the popcorn yet.\n\nIn Mississippi, a conflicted Trump voter\n\nChase Lewis, 24, of Philadelphia, Mississippi, said the move caught him off guard and he still isn’t sure whether he supports it. “It’s good that they’re finally freed from that dictatorship,” he said of Venezuelans, “but I don’t know what it’s going to cost us.”\n\nHe added: “I don’t want my friends that are serving right now to be dragged into a war because we went and stuck our nose in Venezuela’s business.” He noted that Trump had campaigned against starting new wars. “Depending on how you look at it,” he said, “this was an act of war.”\n\nAn electrician apprentice who gave up his delivery job because he needed to make more money, Lewis said he wants to see the Trump administration focus on bringing down costs for young people like himself. He also wants the president to make life better for veterans and worries about plunging the country into more conflicts.\n\nIn Colorado, cheers and caution from Trump voters\n\nTo Trump voter Travis Garcia, leaning against his red pickup truck on a chilly evening in Castle Rock, Colorado, it’s a slam-dunk. “Of course I’m going to be happy that they captured a dictator that’s constantly sending drugs our way,” he said, “If we’re not gonna do it, who’s gonna do it?”\n\nThe 45-year-old, who works in remodeling, said the operation reinforces Trump's stature as “a powerful man who follows through on his word and isn’t going to be shy and timid and let other countries run the rules.”\n\nMary Lussier, 48, a flight attendant from the town of Larkspur, was so amazed by the success of the mission in Venezuela that she would be OK with more such operations. She recalled videos of Venezuelans tearfully celebrating Maduro's removal and said fewer bad leaders “would make the world a little bit lesser of a bad place.”\n\nStill, Lussier wouldn’t want U.S. soldiers stuck in a prolonged conflict, and much of her admiration for the operation hinged less on the possible benefits to the U.S. than on the smooth efficiency and bravado of the raiders.\n\nOutside a Safeway grocery store in Castle Rock, Patrick McCans, 66, said delicately that Trump's intervention was “a little contrary to what he campaigned on.”\n\n“I would like to see more of a diplomatic way of making change,” said the retired engineer. Still, he said, pondering for a moment, “I think in this case it might have been warranted.”\n\nInstead of playing ball, Maduro was “playing chicken with Trump, and Trump doesn’t like chicken,” he said, chuckling from beneath a Baltimore Ravens baseball cap.\n\nThe Colorado Trump supporters interviewed by AP all applauded the military operation’s smoothness and “class,” as one described it. But that support could waver if the U.S. is drawn into a longer conflict, which none of them would support.\n\nFew mentioned Trump’s plans for Venezuela’s oil, but thought Maduro's removal would benefit citizens and slow the drug trade and immigration to the U.S.\n\nFrom Pennsylvania: Good riddance to Maduro\n\nAt the Golden Dawn Diner in Levittown, Pennsylvania, Ron Soto, 88, expressed unreserved faith in the president's ability to manage what comes next. The retired tractor-trailer driver regularly visits the diner to meet friends, drink coffee and catch up.\n\nMaduro is an “awful man,” he said. But should U.S. forces go into other countries, like Cuba, as it did in Venezuela? “I don’t think they’ll have to,” he said. “Because he (Trump) put the fear in them.”\n\nAs for Trump's comment at one point that his administration would “run” Venezuela, Soto said the president will “straighten that country out and make it into a democracy if he can. I don’t know if he can.”\n\nAt the Neshaminy Mall, in Bensalem, retired firefighter Kevin Carey, 62, pronounced himself supportive of what Trump did but aware of the risks.\n\n“I wouldn’t say thrilled but I’m cautiously optimistic,” he said. Carey recalled the seizing of U.S. hostages by Iranian revolutionaries in 1979 as an indication of what might happen if the conflict escalates. But “he'll take all actions to avoid that, I believe,” he said of Trump.\n\nOn any further foreign intervention, Carey broke out laughing when he said: “He wants Greenland to be part of America!”\n\nAt the Trump merchandise store where Bonner shopped, banners and other items proclaiming “Trump 2028” are on display. Trump is constitutionally prohibited from running in 2028.\n\n“I know he can’t run for president” in 2028, said Bonner, a propane company worker. Still, he wanted a lawn sign “just to irritate people” but didn't find one.\n\nThe crisp military operation plainly left him impressed. “They got in and they got out, did what they had to do,” he said. Of Maduro, he said: “He’s an enemy of the United States so I support Trump 100%.”\n\nExiting a Walmart in Martinsville, Indiana, Mark Edward Miller, 75, from nearby Mooresville, said the only thing that surprised him about Trump's intervention was that word of it did not leak in advance. The consistent Trump voter was an aircraft maintenance specialist in the Air Force before his retirement.\n\n“I don’t feel like he’s actually taken over a country,” Miller said. “I believe that he’s doing exactly what our country should be doing — supporting, especially in our hemisphere, governments that are friendly with us” and challenging those that are hostile.\n\nTobin, the man in Michigan who sees a cinematic future for the raid, not only approved of the operation but wants more of them.\n\n“Especially if they were as successful as this last one where we didn’t lose any troops, we didn’t lose any planes or ships,” Tobin said during a visit to the Oakland County Republican Party headquarters, where he was surrounded by Trump and GOP memorabilia. “I am thrilled and surprised” by what happened.\n\n“Cuba’s very nervous right now,” he said. “And the Cuban people are suffering immensely from their horrible situation and their economy. Iran might be next.”\n\nThe three-time Trump voter is an active member of the local Republican Party, a certified firearms instructor and head of a bicycling group in his hometown of Oak Park, Michigan.\n\nHis takeaway: “President Trump does not speak idly. If he says he’s going to do something, he does something.”\n\nBedayn reported from Colorado, Catalini from Pennsylvania, Householder from Michigan, Bates from Mississippi, Lamy from Indiana and Woodward from Washington.",

    "description": "\"Can you imagine if a Pringles distributor paid full retail to Pringles and then sold to grocery stores for full retail, and then the grocery stores had to wait for a rebate?\"",
    "fullText": "Mark Cuban has an idea for how to stop the runaway train that is the $38 trillion national debt, and it has a lot to do with the online pharmacy company he founded in January 2022. On Christmas Eve, the billionaire investor posted on X about his frustrations with the insurance market.\n\nInsurers and providers, according to Cuban, “play on the fear and information asymmetry that exists in healthcare.” He advocated for them to be broken up, so as to “make the markets efficient again.”\n\nWhile Cuban’s proposal focused on $100 fines for insurers that over-bill or deny care, the broader thrust of his argument is dismantling opaque middlemen and forcing transparent pricing—as he does with his Cost Plus Drugs pharmacy—could help tame one of the biggest drivers of America’s fiscal strain.​\n\nAmerica’s national debt surged past $38 trillion in October, adding roughly $1 trillion in just over two months in 2025—twice the pace of typical growth since 2000, according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a leading fiscal watchdog. Annual interest payments are already around $1 trillion and could total as much as $14 trillion over the coming decade, a trajectory the watchdog warns is “no way for a great nation like America to run its finances.” A closer look at health insurance and over-billing doesn’t exactly find fixing the issue would fix the debt or deficit​, but Cuban is right that something is definitely off in this space.\n\nCost Plus Drugs sells medications at their manufacturing cost, plus a flat 15% markup, a small pharmacy fee, and a posted shipping charge. The company cuts out traditional pharmacy benefit managers and negotiates directly with manufacturers, publishing acquisition costs and formulas so customers can see exactly how their prices are built.​\n\nFortune and other outlets have reported Cost Plus Drugs can slash the price of some generics from thousands of dollars a month to double‑digit sums, especially for patients who are uninsured or stuck with high deductibles. Cuban argues if similar transparency and direct‑to‑consumer models were applied across health care—combined with rules like letting cash prices count toward insurance deductibles—the country could strip out layers of waste that burden both families and, ultimately, public budgets.",
