    "fullText": "Booed off the pitch after conceding a late winner at home against their relegation rivals and on a 10-game winless run - these are desperate times for West Ham.\n\nThe Hammers have been in the Premier League in every campaign since 2012-13, but that stretch is under threat.\n\nOn Tuesday, they let a 1-0 lead slip before losing 2-1 to fellow strugglers Nottingham Forest - a result that leaves the Hammers seven points adrift of safety with 17 games to go.\n\n\"We will look to the mirror and know the position we are in, and nobody from the squad wants to play second division next season,\" said West Ham midfielder Tomas Soucek.\n\n\"We have to show the honesty between each other. The truth of who cares and who not.\"\n\nWest Ham, who won a European trophy as recently as 2023, have had a wretched campaign, but their fans would have been hoping for some late presents with an attractive post-Christmas fixture list.\n\nHome games against Fulham, Brighton and Nottingham Forest and a trip to bottom-of-the-table Wolves were a chance for the Hammers to get themselves out of trouble.\n\nOf those 12 points available, West Ham picked up just one - and even that came after they had twice thrown away the lead before drawing 2-2 with Brighton.\n\nThey conceded a late winner against Fulham, were humiliated 3-0 by Wolves and then again managed to lose after scoring first against Forest, with Morgan Gibbs-White converting a decisive 89th-minute penalty.\n\nAt half-time, the Hammers were one point from safety - now they are cut adrift and left facing a huge battle to stay up.\n\nWith four draws and six losses, it is the first time West Ham have gone 10 Premier League games without a win since a run of 11 between December 2006 and March 2007.\n\nOnly Bournemouth with 16 have dropped more top-flight points from winning positions than the Hammers' 15, while West Ham have also failed to win any of their past five matches when scoring first.\n\nBoss Nuno Espirito Santo, who guided Nottingham Forest to Europe last season before being dismissed three games into 2025-26, has now picked up 11 points from 16 matches since he replaced the sacked Graham Potter in September.\n\nThat is the worst start from any West Ham boss in the Premier League era, with the back-to-back wins over Newcastle and Burnley in November - Nuno's only two successes - quickly fading from memory.\n\nFormer West Ham and England goalkeeper Rob Green, speaking on Sky Sports, feels change is needed at London Stadium.\n\n\"Ten games without a win you're wondering, where is the answer now? Where do West Ham go now? Where does Nuno go from here? You can't see things continuing much longer with results like this,\" said Green.\n\n\"They need at least 30 points to have any chance of staying up and they're not going to get close at this rate.\n\n\"I don't see Nuno staying. I just can't see it how you can go this long without winning a game. Tonight wasn't the worst performance by a long shot and they still didn't get a result.\n\n\"It's heartbreaking but I don't see another answer. It's looking more and more an impossible task.\"\n\nWest Ham, with just 14 points all season, have London derbies at Tottenham and Chelsea either side of a tough game at home against Sunderland coming up.\n\nNuno, who handed a debut to Argentina striker Valentin 'Taty' Castellanos and brought on another January signing in Brazilian forward Pablo Felipe, remained defiant.\n\n\"It's not over yet. We keep on going,\" he said. \"We need to keep believing and sticking together.\n\n\"We have to keep going, keep believing and keep working. It is not over. Sometimes you have good moments and bad moments but you need to be resilient enough to understand this is the game.\n\n\"We understand the fans' frustration and the sadness - we are all the same.\"\n\nSoucek insisted Nuno still had the players' backing and added: \"We have to be behind the manager always, until the end.\n\n\"He can be a big help for us because he did a lot through the Premier League already.\n\n\"Especially for him I want to keep going and do the maximum, we don't want them to lose their jobs. All of us, even for the fans, we need to stick together.\"\n\nNuno Espírito Santo's position as West Ham head coach is heavily under the microscope.\n\nSupporters and pundits have already written off the Portuguese's chances of keeping the club in the Premier League. But the real question to ask is: what do the owners think of the job Nuno is doing?\n\nWell, there is certainly disappointment at the results which have left them rooted in the bottom three.\n\nThere is similar sentiment towards the performance of the team and thus the manager.\n\nBut the club's hierarchy are desperate to make Nuno's appointment a success.\n\nThey are actively backing him in the transfer market. The signings of Pablo Felipe and Taty Castellanos were both players selected by Nuno.\n\nSo to pull the rug from under him, having made signings on the manager's recommendation, would seem nonsensical. But the threat of relegation can radically change the direction of travel.\n\nWest Ham are seven points adrift from safety. That scenario will really test the board's backing of their under-pressure boss.\n\nPremier League: Gibbs-White scores late Forest winner at West Ham\n\nLatest West Ham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about West Ham - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "No. 9 BYU hosts rebuilt Arizona State on Wednesday at the Marriott Center before first matchup with rival Utah on Saturday in Salt Lake City.",
    "fullText": "One of the best things about playing basketball in the Big 12 is that there is no such thing as a trap game, even when a matchup with your fiercest rival is on the horizon.\n\nThat has been BYU coach Kevin Young’s message to his team this week as it prepares for a Wednesday night showdown (7 p.m. MST, Peacock), its Big 12 home opener, at the Marriott Center with reimagined Arizona State (0-1, 9-5), a team that features three explosive scorers and a savvy, experienced and fiery coach, Bobby Hurley.\n\nBYU (1-0, 13-1) finishes the week playing at rival Utah (0-1, 8-6) on Saturday, but Young said there will be no looking ahead. The Sun Devils have too much talent to overlook, and they were one of the better 3-point shooting teams in the country until their last three games, losses at UCLA and at home to Oregon State and Colorado.\n\nUtah (0-1, 8-6) will play at Colorado on Wednesday night before hosting BYU in the Huntsman Center on Saturday night in what will be the first coaching meeting of Young and Alex Jensen, who also came to the college ranks from the NBA.\n\n“To be honest, I haven’t even thought about Utah,” Young said Tuesday afternoon. “We’re extremely locked in on Arizona State and trying to make sure we are dialed in for them. They are a good team, much better than they were last year.”\n\nThe Cougars swept the Sun Devils last year, winning 76-56 in Provo and 91-81 in Tempe.\n\nYoung said Arizona State is “totally different” than it was last year, with sophomore guard Trevor Best the only holdover from a squad that went 4-16 in league play and 13-20 overall. Another familiar face on the ASU roster is 6-foot-8 redshirt sophomore Marcus Adams Jr., who played sparingly for BYU in 2023-24 before Young arrived in Provo. He’s averaging 3.6 points and 2.4 rebounds off the bench.\n\nPacific/Pepperdine transfer Maurice “Moe” Odum leads them in scoring with a 16.6 average, while NAIA University of the Cumberlands transfer Anthony “Pig” Johnson chips in 14.1 points per game and 7-foot-1 freshman Massamba Diop of Senegal averages 13.6 per outing.\n\nArizona State’s best wins were over Texas and Washington State at the Maui Invitational and over Oklahoma and Santa Clara in December.\n\n“They are talented. They did a good job finding good players. I am really impressed with several of their guys,” Young said. “They are obviously super long, starting 6-10, 6-11, 7-1 (players) inside. And then the guard, Moe Odum, he’s as dynamic of a guard as we’ve seen to date.”\n\nDefense and 3-point shooting has abandoned Hurley’s bunch in the three-game skid. They are shooting 19.2% from beyond the arc during that stretch, after shooting 45.3% from deep in the three games before that, against lesser competition.\n\n“We are in a tailspin right now from behind the 3-point line, and we have made a lot of those shots,” Hurley said after the Colorado loss. “… We have to solve our rebounding, and we have to solve our interior defense.”\n\nMeanwhile, BYU enters its first home game since Dec. 22 as one of the hottest teams in the country, and unbeaten in Big 12 play after its 83-73 win at Kansas State last Saturday. The Cougars have won 10-straight games for the first time since the 2010-11 season (when they did that twice) and have won nine-straight Big 12 regular-season games dating back to last year.\n\nStar wing AJ Dybantsa leads the country in scoring (23.1 ppg.) and sophomore guard Rob Wright III, a transfer from Baylor, has been “unbelievable as well,” Young said.\n\n“Rob’s experience in our league is also something that I think I’ve not only relied on, but will rely on even more as we move forward in conference play,” Young said.\n\nThe Cougars last won nine-straight regular-season conference games in 2020, when they were in the West Coast Conference.\n\n“We are fairly happy with where we are at,” said senior wing Richie Saunders after he, Dybantsa and Wright combined to score 52 points against KSU. “There are so many things we are still growing at, still getting better at. I feel good about where we are at, but we still need to grow more. … We want to peak at or near the end of conference play. But I like where we are currently at.”",

    "description": "Jackson's greatness didn't lead to late-game rallies or playoff win streaks. John Harbaugh was judged on that. His successor will be, too.",
    "fullText": "John Harbaugh was a very good and occasionally great NFL head coach. But with Lamar Jackson in tow, he trended squarely toward the former.\n\nAfter missing the playoffs in 2025 and with a 3-5 postseason record with the two-time MVP in tow, the Baltimore Ravens decided they'd seen enough. Harbaugh made it past Black Monday. He didn't last beyond Tuesday; the Ravens fired him two days after Baltimore's season ended with a missed 44-yard field goal in Pittsburgh.\n\n2025 was a perfect storm for the Ravens, who managed to stave off postseason elimination until the very last second of the regular season anyway. The defense fell apart under former rising star coordinator Zach Orr. An undermanned receiving corps was effectively a one-man show. And, most importantly, Lamar Jackson didn't look anything like the best version of himself.\n\nInjuries played a part. Jackson was, per usual, as banged up as you'd expect a running quarterback to be. He missed four starts due to injury and left two other games with hamstring and back injuries. But when he did play, he was a fraction of the quarterback he once was in every facet of the game.\n\nHis passing output dropped from 245 yards per game to 196. His sack rate exploded from 4.6 percent to 10.6. Negative plays compounded while explosive ones dwindled. His expected points added (EPA) per dropback fell from 0.29 in last year's first-team All-Pro campaign (best in the NFL) to -0.04 (22nd, just behind a 42-year-old Aaron Rodgers). His average target distance, deep ball and tight window rates all remained roughly the same but the delivery changed, leading to a significant dropoff. His 72.4 percent on-target throw rate was the lowest of his career.\n\nTJ WATT PICKS OFF LAMAR ON THE DEFLECTED PASS.\n\nBALvsPIT on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/ViXTN12C7G\n\nThat threatened to make him the run-to-paper-over-bad-throws quarterback detractors falsely accused him of being early in his career. Instead, his ground game shrank in lock step with his aerial regression.\n\nJackson went from 8.2 rushing attempts per game in 2024 -- then a career-low -- to 5.2, running less often than nine other NFL quarterbacks including Justin Fields and Jaxson Dart. His success rate, measured by how often a play gains at least 40 percent of yards required on first down, 60 percent of yards required on second down, and 100 percent on third or fourth down, ranked first in the NFL at 64.3 percent in 2022.\n\nIn 2024, it hit 56.1 to rank fifth among all qualified runners and second only to Jayden Daniels among quarterbacks. In 2025, his 5.2 yards per carry came with a career-low 47.8 percent success rate. That's the first time it's dipped below 50 percent and good for 48th place among all players and seventh among QBs.\n\nThere is hope this was all injury related and a rebound is near. But cracks began to show even before injury turned the offense over to Cooper Rush (horrible) and Tyler Huntley (mostly fine). He dazzled through the air in Weeks 1 through 4 and still went 1-3 in those games. He was sacked 15 times in those games, including seven times by the Detroit Lions -- something that's only ever happened once before in 116 regular season starts. He ran the ball fewer than four times per game. While he was efficient through the air, it was in a way that didn't swing games.\n\nThat leads us back to a problem that's persisted throughout his career. Jackson traditionally tends to come up short in close battles. He has 13 career game-winning drives in 115 regular season and postseason starts. He had five such drives in 62 games since 2022. Bo Nix, on the other hand, had seven game-winning drives in 2025 alone. Caleb Williams had six.\n\nBack in Week 1, he couldn't sustain the late drives to keep the Buffalo Bills from coming back from a 40-25 deficit in the final four minutes (obviously Baltimore's deficient defense deserves some blame as well). Early fourth quarter stall-outs kept him from delivering a home win against Detroit in Week 3.\n\nWeek 18 saw him dazzle late to keep the Ravens punching in a sloppy heavyweight de facto playoff game in Pittsburgh.\n\nLAMAR. ZAY. WOW.\n\nRAVENS TAKE THE LEAD.\n\nBALvsPIT on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/RLFrGLddRj\n\nWhile Tyler Loop's missed kick wasn't his fault, the previous loss to the Steelers -- 27-22 after Jackson led four different fourth quarter drives into Steeler territory at home and came away with exactly two field goals and nothing else -- kinda is.\n\nThat was Harbaugh's problem with Jackson. He couldn't turn his quarterback's dazzling heroics into the wins that mattered. Baltimore is 76-31 with its star quarterback at the helm in the regular season. It's 3-5 in the playoffs with a single trip beyond the Divisional Round, zero postseason win streaks and zero Super Bowl appearances to show for it.\n\nJackson's passer rating drops from an NFL-best (ever!) 102.2 in the regular season to 84.6. His sack rate goes from 7.3 to 10.4. Even though he improves a bit as a runner in January, it's not enough to cover his failings.\n\nThe Ravens took all this in. They decided good was, in fact, the enemy of great. They opted to venture into the unknown rather than head back to the playoffs with a sinking feeling of failure enveloping them.\n\nRestoring Jackson isn't the only pressing issue Baltimore's new coach will face. The defensive identity of one of the league's hardest-hitting teams has been cracked and needs to be rebuilt. Derrick Henry is 31 years old and can only keep this up for another one, two decades tops.\n\nBut ultimately, Harbaugh's replacement will be judged on his ability to turn Jackson into something more than a regular season award magnet. Improvement may be easy to come by once the dynamic quarterback is healthy again. It won't mean anything until he starts stringing together comeback wins or rallying Baltimore to multiple playoff victories.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Whomever replaces John Harbaugh as Ravens coach has to fix Lamar Jackson",

    "fullText": "USC has beefed up its defensive line room once again, landing Penn State defensive end transfer Zuriah Fisher out of the NCAA Transfer Portal.\n\nFisher, a fifth-year redshirt senior, appeared in 11 games this season for the Nittany Lions and had his best statistical season yet. The 6-foot-3, 265-pounder totaled 19 tackles, 3.5 TFLs and a pair of sacks while also forcing a fumble.\n\n“I think internally within our program, I think there is a lot of confidence that Fish has got a chance to have a big year,” former head coach James Franklin said of Fisher prior to this season. “He’s like one of those guys that I don’t think anybody’s talking about right now, outside of the program, based on just not seeing him recently, but there’s a lot of excitement internally, with our players, with our staff. I think those things are really apparent.”\n\nThat came after sitting out the 2024 campaign due to injury, giving him a medical redshirt that season. In 2023, Fisher played in all 13 of the team’s games, notching 16 tackles, 3.5 tackles for loss and three sacks. Prior to that, he appeared in 10 games over his first three seasons with PSU.\n\nA member of the Class of 2020, he is expected to have one year of eligibility remaining with the Trojans. As a high schooler, Fisher was a four-star prospect and tabbed as the nation’s No. 320 overall recruit and No. 20 EDGE in his class.\n\nNow, after finishing his sixth year at the college level this fall, he’ll look for a breakout opportunity in Los Angeles. The Trojans are expected to bring back their top three pass rushers in underclassmen Kameryn Crawford, Jide Abasiri and Braylan Shelby.\n\nThe young trio totaled 13.5 sacks last season, and USC also brings in one of the nation’s premier defensive end recruits in five-star Luke Wafle. With so much young talent, a veteran presence like Fisher could elevate the Trojans into one of the best pass-rushing groups in the country next year.",

    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks are looking like victims of their own success. While the players are getting an extra week of rest due to the No. 1 seed, their coaches are busier than ever... even with non-Seahawks related matters. Offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak is already getting plenty of requests from teams around the league to be their head coach, such as the Atlanta Falcons, but he isn't the only Seahawks coach drawing interest.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, NFL insider Ian Rapoport broke the news the Cleveland Browns have officially requested to interview Seahawks defensive coordinator Aden Durde for their open head coach position. Although head coach Mike Macdonald is the one who calls the plays on defense, Seattle's success on that side of the ball can certainly be attributed to help from Durde as well.\n\nThe #Browns have requested permission to interview #Seahawks DC Aden Durde for their vacant HC job, source said.\n\nThe native of England came to the NFL as a #Cowboys coaching intern and has risen quickly.\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 6, 2026\n\nDurde has been the Seahawks' defensive coordinator for the last two seasons. Personally, I had some hope with Macdonald being the one who calls the plays, Durde might've remained a well-kept secret in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nNFL organizations cannot deny a coach from interviewing for a position that is an upgrade, so if Durde is interested in throwing his hat in the ring with the Browns, it will be up to him.\n\nAs for Kubiak, several other teams in the league have joined the Falcons in asking permission to interview him for their vacant head coaching spots. However, according to Albert Breer, Kubiak is still figuring out what to do with the requests.\n\nSeahawks OC Klint Kubiak has gotten requests to interview for the Giants, Cardinals, Raiders and Falcons head coaching jobs, per source. His focus is on the playoffs, so he'll take a day or two and figure out a plan to balance all of it.\n\nSeattle is on a bye as the NFC's 1 seed.\n\n— Albert Breer (@AlbertBreer) January 6, 2026\n\nBoth of Seattle's coordinators getting interview requests is a challenge the Seahawks will have to navigate during the bye week. Teams can often lose focus during this time if they are not careful, which often results in catastrophic losses. Seattle needs to find a way to balance everything, as Breer mentioned in the tweet above, in order to maximize this rare opportunity for a potential Super Bowl run.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Cleveland Browns request to interview Seattle Seahawks DC Aden Durde",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots went to battle last Sunday with a limited wide receiver room.\n\nVeteran pass catcher Mack Hollins missed his second consecutive game. Hollins went on the injured reserve after an injury suffered in Week 16. He will be on the sideline until at least the AFC Conference Championship Game.\n\nUndrafted rookie receiver Efton Chism III played in 44% of the offense’s snaps against the Miami Dolphins, just one week after logging a career-high 41 snaps played in the blowout win over the New York Jets.\n\nChism was the team’s sixth receiver all season, but has had to step up in Hollins’ absence.\n\nAs such, there is room for one more receiver on New England’s practice squad as a post-season insurance policy.\n\nThe Patriots hosted two free-agent wide receivers on Tuesday to potentially fill this vacancy, ESPN’s Mike Reiss reported on X.\n\nThe first was former Division II standout Cole Burgess. Burgess recorded 3,133 yards in his four-year career for the Cortland Red Dragons. He tallied 87 receptions for 1,375 yards and 16 touchdowns as a senior. He has spent the last two seasons on the Cincinnati Bengals’ practice squad.\n\nThe other receiver is the New York Jets undrafted free agent rookie signing Dymere Miller. Miller was a practice squad player for the Patriots’ AFC East rival, and he, too, took a unique route to the NFL.\n\nHe began his college career playing for FCS Monmouth in New Jersey. In his third year at Monmouth, he was a Walter Payton Award finalist (the FCS version of the Heisman Trophy). In that historic season, he set school records for single-season receptions with 90, single-season receiving yards with 1,293 and a single-game record when he recorded 333 receiving yards in a loss to UNH.\n\nMiller then transferred to Rutgers, where he played a more than respectable senior season that earned him a spot on an NFL roster.\n\nNo signings have been made, but the Patriots have remained diligent in pursuing potential roster-strengthening opportunities.\n\nPatriots Rumors: Assistant To Interview For Head Coaching Vacancy",

    "fullText": "Yuki Kawamura's path to playing time after signing with Bulls originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Chicago Bulls made a roster move Tuesday, bringing back fan favorite Yuki Kawamura on a two-way deal.\n\nAfter an impressive run in the 2025 NBA Summer League with Chicago, it seemed certain that Kawamura would compete for minutes deep into the rotation. In five Summer League games, Kawamura averaged 10.2 points, 6.2 assists, 2.4 rebounds and 2.2 steals while showcasing impressive vision in 23.9 minutes per game.\n\nThat said, it never worked out that way, as Chicago's roster was stacked with guards like Josh Giddey, Coby White, Kevin Huerter, Tre Jones and Jevon Carter.\n\nAs a result, the Bulls waived Kawamura prior to the season.\n\nHowever, they've brought him back now, waiving Trentyn Flowers to complete the move.\n\nThis will give Kawamura his first opportunity of the season to earn NBA minutes. Last year with the Memphis Grizzlies, Kawamura only appeared in 22 games, averaging 4.2 minutes per contest. In limited action he averaged 1.6 points and 0.9 assists. In the G-League for Memphis, Kawamura averaged a double-double with 13.7 points and 10.7 assists per game.\n\nAlthough, he could earn an opportunity sooner rather than later as Giddey remains sidelined with a hamstring injury. Additionally, White has been listed as questionable for Chicago's next matchup against Detroit.\n\nKawamura will have his first chance to suit up against the Pistons Wednesday and again Thursday versus the Miami Heat on the second night of a back-to-back.\n\nVJ Edgecombe reaches stats unseen by a rookie since LeBron in 2003\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander praises Chet Holmgren for OKC's success\n\nLeBron James breaks another scoring record in win over Grizzlies\n\nTyrese Maxey: 'Joel Embiid was really the first person to believe in me'\n\nOne of the NBA's most efficient players is on a two-way contract\n\nCam Thomas' most recent dispute with Brooklyn ignites trade rumors\n\nMiami reveals the status of Tyler Herro, Bam Adebyao and more ahead of Saturday's game\n\nGuerschon Yabusele addresses his future with the Knicks following trade rumors",

Assuming he returns to full health, there is no reason to think that team could not return to form in 2026.\"\n\nMore:Todd Bowles gives outstanding response over Buccaneers future\n\nThey can. But one thing must be done for that to happen.\n\nThe franchise has to get on top of its crippling injuries.\n\nIn the back-to-back seasons, the Buccaneers suffered mightily with injuries. In 2024, they were lucky enough to overcome it. In 2025? Not so much.\n\nThe offense has enough key pieces for the Buccaneers to bounce back with ease. But the defense for most is where the problems are, and that's Bowles' department.\n\nWe have seen the Baltimore Ravens move on from John Harbaugh, and for some Bucs fans, Bowles should follow suit.\n\nBut the key to a 2026 revival lies with Baker and this star-studded offense.\n\nBuccaneers get what they deserve after Week 18 disaster\n\nBuccaneers 'break that spell' in Week 18, but too little, too late?\n\nNo Week 18 pity party for Buccaneers' Todd Bowles\n\nWhy Buccaneers' 'main focus' is an odd aspect of Week 18",

    "fullText": "Kansas last signed a blue-chip quarterback prospect in the 2011 cycle when four-star Brock Berglund landed in Lawrence — albeit for a short period of time.\n\nCould the Jayhawks land a top QB in the 2027 cycle? That remains to be seen, but they are a top contender for Temecula (Calif.) Chaparral four-star Dane Weber.\n\nThe 6-foot signal-caller made multiple trips to Lawrence in 2025. He’s gotten familiar with the KU staff, and on Monday, he was visited by offensive analyst Eric Terrazas:\n\nAppreciate your time and effort @CoachTraz \n\nAmazing home Visit!!! @KU_Football@Kotelnicki @KUCoachZ @CoachLeipold #ROCKCHALK pic.twitter.com/Am9v9krdT6\n\n— Dane Weber (@DaneWeber08) January 5, 2026\n\nWhen speaking with Rivals’ Greg Biggins around New Year’s Day, Weber tabbed Kansas as one of two schools pushing the hardest entering 2026. The Jayhawks have clearly made Weber a priority and he’s feeling the love.\n\nCincinnati, Colorado and Washington have all made their presence felt in Weber’s recruitment to this point, too. There’s other programs that he expects to come and see him throw ahead of the busy spring period, including Oregon and Auburn.\n\n“It will be good to connect with those coaches and see where I’m at on their boards,” Weber told Biggins. “The transfer portal is opening up and I’m interested to see where everyone ends up. By end of January, I want to cut it down and then set up trips. The plan will be to take my visits and then make my decision in late Spring.”\n\nWeber is the No. 357 overall prospect and No. 25 QB in the 2027 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all major recruiting media companies. He’s also the No. 35 recruit in California.\n\nBiggins writes this of Weber, who put together a nice campaign in 2025:\n\n“Weber had a big junior season and is one of the nation’s true dual-threat quarterbacks. He’s a pocket guy who can carve up a defense and threw for 3,645 yards and 41 touchdowns while completing 70% of his throws. He can take off and run at any time and rushed for 688 yards and 14 touchdowns on the ground and is the type of signal caller who can stress a defense with his arm and his legs.”\n\nKU is currently without a commitment in its 2027 class. Last month, it inked 17 prospects, compiling the No. 54 class in the nation, according to the Rivals Industry Team Recruiting Rankings.\n\nHead coach Lance Leipold and Co. did sign a QB as Maize (Kan.) Northwest three-star Jaylen Mason opted to stay home. He’s now Rivals’ No. 49 QB and No. 6 recruit in the Sunflower State.",

Josh Giddey will be out due to a hamstring injury for two weeks. Zach Collins is out with a sprained right toe, but is expected to return on January 10th. Jalen Smith is out with a concussion, while Matas Buzelis is down with an illness, despite both being listed as day-to-day.\n\nCoby White joined the fray after reinjuring his right calf during his game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on December 29th. He would miss the next three games against the New Orleans Pelicans, Orlando Magic, and Charlotte Hornets. He would return to play against the Boston Celtics, but came off the bench while being placed on a 25-minute restriction.\n\nAlthough he had an off-night, scoring just 5 points while going 2-7 from the field and 1-5 from the three-point line, it’s clear the Bulls are taking precautionary measures to slowly ease White into the rotation. With Josh Giddey out, the team will depend on White to carry out his offensive responsibilities along with veteran Nikola Vucevic. However, it’s only possible if White remains healthy as he finally gets over the stagnant calf injury that sidelined him for most of the season.\n\nMORE:Bulls sign 5-foot-7 fan-favorite guard, cut ties with second-year wing\n\nWith this in mind, White is questionable for his matchup on Wednesday against the Detroit Pistons. This is the first game of a back-to-back before the Bulls would go on to play the Miami Heat on Thursday for the second night. The franchise might limit White to play just one game while resting for the other due to injury management. Expect to hear more closer to gametime with the Pistons on his availability.\n\nClippers linked to Trae Young in bid to replace franchise legend\n\nWarriors' Jonathan Kuminga linked to blockbuster trade with Mavericks\n\nSixers' Tyrese Maxey earns high praise from LeBron James\n\nKnicks receive tough update on Josh Hart before Clippers game\n\nHeat not expected to waive Terry Rozier ahead of Wednesday's deadline",

    "fullText": "Football is theatre. For someone who has chosen journalism as a career, it's easy to appreciate a good story. One of the most important of Tuesday's news cycle involves a former Philadelphia Eagles assistant. John Harbaugh has been fired. He leaves the Baltimore Ravens after leading them for nearly two decades.\n\nAround these parts, we've been busy talking about the Birds in Philadelphia, but The Flock in Baltimore has been equally fascinating. Their story involves a 30th-anniversary campaign, disappointment, and ultimately a loss in the NFL's final regular-season game. That eliminates them from postseason contention.\n\nHarbaugh has been on the hot seat all season and is now unemployed, but he won't be for long. ESPN's top NFL insider Adam Schefter reports that at least seven teams have inquired about his services. That includes one team that hasn't fired its head coach yet.\n\nWhat does this have to do with the NFC East, you ask? We appreciate the question. Lines are being drawn connecting the dots representing John Harbaugh and the New York Giants. Schefter released his report on that also.\n\nSources: John Harbaugh is expected to emerge as a favorite for the head coaching job of the New York Giants.\n\nHarbaugh will be in demand for many teams, not just the Giants.\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 6, 2026\n\nJohn Harbaugh comes from Andy Reid's coaching tree. He spent ten seasons as the Eagles' special teams coordinator and defensive backs coach. It's sad that his tenure in Baltimore ends partially because of a special teams miscue.\n\nAfter having spent so much time here, it isn't shocking to find an Eagles fan who still loves him. That all goes out of the window however if he lands in Gotham as the leader of the hated Giants.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: John Harbaugh is the favorite for the New York Giants job",

His running has remained dangerous, but he's also improved his accuracy and game processing in such a way that makes him an all-around threat.\n\nGiven that it's not often that new, exciting QBs spring out of nowhere, Willis will be tempting for a lot of teams to try. It feels like he's got untapped upside.\n\nAnd with QB-needy teams around the league, someone is going to pay Willis. At this point, it's not even a matter of how much, because a payday is coming.

    "fullText": "Which team suits Jeremiyah Love in this years upcoming NFL draft originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAs the 2026 NFL Draft approaches, one name rising quickly on scouts’ boards is Notre Dame’s dynamic running back, Jeremiyah Love. Considered a top prospect and projected as a potential first-round pick, Love is generating significant buzz due to his rare combination of size, speed, and versatility. Mock drafts frequently link him to teams like the New Orleans Saints, Kansas City Chiefs, and Minnesota Vikings, with other franchises such as the New York Giants, Jets, and Arizona Cardinals also reportedly interested.\n\nStanding out at 6-foot-1 and around 220 pounds, Love combines downhill power running with breakaway speed, making him a threat between the tackles and in the open field. His 2025 season was remarkable; he set Notre Dame’s single-season touchdown record, proving his ability to find the end zone with consistency.\n\nBut Love isn’t just a runner. He’s a polished receiver out of the backfield, frequently lining up as a wide option and showing great hands and route-running ability. This dual-threat skill set is essential in today’s NFL, where running backs must impact the passing game as much as the ground game. Love’s willingness and ability as a pass protector further increase his value, showing he can handle the complexities of NFL blocking schemes.\n\nOne of the teams most commonly associated with Love in mock drafts is the New Orleans Saints. The Saints have a strong quarterback in place and a talented receiving corps, including Chris Olave, but lack a true star running back. Love would bring a new dimension to their offense with his downhill running style and receiving skills. The Saints also need to bolster their offensive line, but Love’s versatility would allow them to maximize their existing weapons.\n\nSimilarly, the Kansas City Chiefs could be an ideal landing spot. Pairing Love with Patrick Mahomes would provide a dynamic, multi-dimensional offensive threat capable of creating mismatches against defenses. The Minnesota Vikings, looking to rejuvenate their backfield, also make sense given Love’s potential to be a long-term solution in their offense.\n\nThe debate about drafting running backs in the first round remains lively. While some analysts are cautious due to the importance of offensive line play, recent first-round backs like Bijan Robinson and Jahmyr Gibbs have proven how impactful the position can be with the right supporting cast. Saquon Barkley, another top-10 running back pick, demonstrated his full potential only after moving to Philadelphia, highlighting how situational fit is crucial.\n\nLove fits the mold of a first-round back who can immediately influence a team’s offensive identity. His combination of power, speed, and receiving ability offers a unique weapon that can change the way defenses prepare.\n\nUltimately, Jeremiyah Love is more than just a running back; he is a multi-faceted offensive weapon ready to make an immediate impact in the NFL. While some teams may hesitate to use a first-round pick on a running back due to positional value debates, Love’s talent and fit with teams in need could see him selected in the top 15 or even top 10.\n\nIf the Saints or Chiefs decide to prioritize offense in the early rounds, Love’s name will be among the first called a player who can bring explosiveness and versatility to an NFL offense hungry for game-changers. His draft stock continues to rise, and many believe he could redefine the value of the running back position in 2026.\n\nOregon's Dan Lanning rips College Football Playoff, calls for major changes\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nTop 2026 NFL Draft prospect suffers broken rib in CFP quarterfinal loss\n\nESPN's grade for LSU hiring Lane Kiffin will make Ole Miss fans even more mad\n\nDabo Swinney fires Clemson coaches immediately after loss to Penn State\n\nOhio State's Ryan Day faces backlash after Cotton Bowl",

He made his first career start against Central Michigan at right guard following an injury to initial starter Brady Norton, and Guarnera started at that spot the rest of the year.\n\nHe was the highest-graded Michigan offensive lineman on Pro Football Focus (69.5 overall grade) in 2025 and is now expected to have a major role for Kyle Whittingham’s first squad in Ann Arbor.\n\nThe interesting part about Guarnera hopping in the portal in the first place is that he told reporters down in Orlando during the week of the Citrus Bowl that he intended to stay with the program, but then entered the portal just a few days later anyways.\n\nRegardless of the exact circumstances that led him to the portal, it’s good to have him officially back in the mix for the 2026 season.

    "fullText": "Ohio State wide receiver Quincy Porter plans to enter the NCAA transfer portal, according to On3’s Hayes Fawcett. Porter wound up spending just one season with the program after being a big-time recruit. He will soon be on the open market and presumably have a ton of suitors waiting on the other end.\n\nPorter played high school football at Oradell (NJ) Bergen Catholic, where he was a five-star prospect. He was the No. 22 overall recruit in the 2025 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies.\n\nOnly two wide receivers were ranked ahead of Porter. Oregon‘s Dakorien Moore was one of them, followed by Kaliq Lockett of the Texas Longhorns.\n\nRivals was higher on Porter than the rest of the industry. He came in as the No. 13 overall prospect in the Rivals300. Only one other service ranked him as a five-star. Expectations for what Porter can become certainly are high.\n\nFew in the college game are better than Brian Hartline at recruiting wide receivers. Hartline got Porter into the mix back in June 2024, holding onto the verbal all the way through National Signing Day. Schools such as Alabama, Michigan, and Penn State were considered other contenders at the time.\n\nHartline is no longer in Columbus, though, after leaving to become USF‘s next head coach. Ohio State did hire Cortez Hankton to replace him as the wide receivers coach. But Porter is still going to at least entertain the idea of continuing his playing days elsewhere.\n\nAs for his on-field production, Porter played in four games this season. Only four catches came his way for a total of 59 yards. Wide receiver is a loaded position at Ohio State, making playing time hard to come by, even for somebody as talented as Porter.\n\nLooking at the future, four years of eligibilty should remain. Porter only playing in four games means a redshirt can be taken by him.\n\nOhio State just saw its season end on New Year’s Eve in the Cotton Bowl. Miami was on the right side of a College Football Playoff quarterfinal, taking down the reigning national champions. Day and the entire Buckeyes staff now work toward building a roster capable of getting back to the top in 2026.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire. The On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs (25-10) are traveling to Memphis to take on the Grizzlies (15-20) in a battle of Western Conference teams on Jan. 6.\n\nBoth teams are coming into the matchup having lost previous games, but the Grizzlies are currently on a four-game losing streak. On the other hand, the Spurs are coming off losing to the Portland Trail Blazers after winning the two before.\n\nHeading into the matchup, the game's injury report had some convincing news on Spurs superstar Victor Wembanyama.\n\nAccording to the NBA's latest injury report, the Spurs listed Victor Wembanyama (knee) as available for Tuesday against the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nESPN's Michael C. Wright wrote that, similarly to the recovery process of Wembanyama's calf strain earlier in the season, which resulted in missing 12 games, the 22-year-old will come off San Antonio's bench and play with a minutes restriction.\n\nThe Spurs are hoping that the big man can put the injuries behind him and stay healthy for the rest of the season.\n\nDevin Vassell (adductor) will miss his fourth straight game.\n\nFor the Grizzlies, they have a long list of players missing Tuesday's matchup. Ja Morant (calf), Cedric Coward (ankle), Zach Edey (ankle), Ty Jerome (calf), Brandon Clarke (calf), Scotty Pippen Jr. (toe), and John Konchar (thumb) are all listed as out.\n\nVince Williams Jr. (patellar tendinitis) will be available and most likely be in the starting lineup with all of the injuries to Memphis.\n\nMitch Johnson urges the San Antonio Spurs to start games on the right foot\n\nSteve Kerr admits the Thunder and the Spurs are long-term championship contenders\n\nJulian Champagnie reflects on working hard as an undrafted player\n\nLuke Kornet found success by letting go: Inside Spurs big man's evolution away from 3-point specialist",

    "fullText": "Nebraska football finally has its transfer portal quarterback after some trials and tribulations.\n\nThe Cornhuskers landed a commitment from former UNLV quarterback Anthony Colandrea on Jan. 6, a day after former Notre Dame quarterback Kenny Minchey flipped his pledge from Nebraska to Kentucky. Minchey committed to Nebraska on Jan. 4 before changing his mind Jan. 5.\n\nColandrea was the Mountain West Player of the Year in 2025 after passing for 3,459 yards with 23 touchdowns to nine interceptions, also rushing for 649 yards and 10 scores. He was a two-year starter at Virginia before transferring to UNLV, where he starred for first-year coach Dan Mullen.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Day after committing to Nebraska, Notre Dame QB Kenny Minchey signs with Kentucky\n\nThe 6-foot signal caller is the No. 175-ranked player and No. 21 quarterback, according to 247Sports' transfer portal ratings. He's listed as a three-star recruit, per the recruiting service, and also took a visit to Florida State. Minchey was listed as a four-star recruit and No. 12 quarterback.\n\nColandrea is tasked with replacing two-year starter Dylan Raiola, who entered the transfer portal after suffering a season-ending injury. Raiola, a former five-star recruit, is still uncommitted.\n\nNebraska finished 7-6 in 2025 despite entering the season with lofty expectations. Raiola's injury didn't help, of course, leaving the program with true freshman TJ Lateef, who made four starts. The Cornhuskers went 1-4 in their last five games.\n\nColandrea is looking to bring some much-needed dual-threat ability to an offense that's losing star running back Emmett Johnson to the NFL draft, along with veteran receiver Dane Key.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Nebraska football lands UNLV transfer Anthony Colandrea as next QB",

    "description": "As a child-free couple with remote jobs, we choose not to spend Christmas and New Year's gathering with family. Instead, we travel somewhere new.",
    "fullText": "When most of us think of the holidays, we picture spending them with family — and that's exactly what my husband and I did for over 20 years.\n\nOur tradition was to stay in Los Angeles to be with my parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins, who all lived within driving distance of our home.\n\nIt was always fun eating tamales, dancing to traditional ranchero music, and laughing at my dad's nonsensical jokes. However, as time has passed, things have changed.\n\nOld relationships ended, and new ones began, and loved ones passed away, including my dad and grandparents. Life also took a big turn once my husband and I both started working remotely in 2020.\n\nSince then, we've become much more spontaneous and creative about how we spend the holidays. We never really know where we'll be, and that's part of what makes it so exciting.\n\nMy husband and I are close to our families, so sometimes it still feels a little weird not to spend the holidays with them. But they're supportive of our travels, and we see them throughout the year.\n\nBecause we have no children or pets, we try to make the most of our flexibility and freedom. This is especially true during the holidays, when we usually have one to two weeks off from work.\n\nIt's a chance for us to rest (and reset) our minds, and enjoy each other's company without worrying about deadlines and meetings.\n\nFor the first couple of trips on our own, we stayed within driving distance of home.\n\nAfter several days in Phoenix during the 2021 Christmas holiday break, we rented a condo in the Catalina Foothills of Tucson. It had the most magnificent views of the city, and that trip remains one of my all-time favorites.\n\nAside from our daily walks among the saguaro cactuses, we didn't do anything major, which was exactly the point.\n\nIt was enough to take in the views, bask in the sunshine, and visit a couple of fantastic local spots — Coronet, a top-notch restaurant-bar with a charming outdoor patio, and Motosonora Brewing Company, a cool tap room and beer garden.\n\nThe following year, we continued the relaxed desert theme and spent the holidays in Palm Springs and Joshua Tree, where a couple of friends met up with us. We loved the wide-open skies, stunning natural landscapes, and the overall slower pace.\n\nIn 2023, we wanted to go bigger, so we splurged on a 10-day vacation to Isla Mujeres, a tiny island off the coast of Cancún.\n\nThough this wasn't our favorite trip — and we made a few mistakes planning it — swimming in the warm turquoise waters of the Caribbean was incredible, and we don't regret the experience.\n\nMost recently, we spent the 2025 to 2026 holiday season in Paris, a trip we didn't even plan until the last minute.\n\nMy husband grew up on the East Coast and has missed having a wintry Christmas ever since we've been together, so we figured we may as well go to our favorite city.\n\nIt was magical. From the gorgeous store decorations and festive street lights to the outdoor Christmas markets and cafés serving vin chaud (mulled hot wine), it felt like we were living in a holiday movie — one that we didn't want to end.\n\nFortunately, it didn't have to. Although the holidays are officially over, we were able to extend our stay in Paris through February, where we'll continue working remotely.\n\nThough we absolutely love to travel, we're not wealthy, so we're always mindful of our expenses. But when we feel it's worth it, we don't hesitate because we know life is short, nothing lasts forever, and we want to follow our bliss while we can.",

    "description": "Unnecessary characters, replacing the main star, and adding ridiculous plots are just some of the signs that it's time to call it quits.",
    "fullText": "For every show that we've mourned getting canceled prematurely, there are others chugging along on season eight that have become unwatchable.\n\nWe've compiled a list of 35 shows that didn't need to last as long as they did, whether that's because they should've stayed a limited series, the writers were running out of ideas, or simply because it took too long for the show to come out.\n\nHere are 35 shows that we think overstayed their welcome.\n\nWe were never going to be mad about more \"Stranger Things,\" but we are mad it took a decade to wrap up … and that the finale was on the underwhelming side.\n\nThis is more of a calendar problem than a content problem. When this show started, the \"Stranger Things\" kids were still actually kids. But just five seasons — and a whopping nine years later — these \"kids\" are adults. Like, \"Millie Bobby Brown is a wife and mother\" adults. Maybe that's why it was a bit laughable that the show concluded with its main characters graduating from high school.\n\nIt also became clear during the finale that perhaps this show was never suited to becoming as huge as it did. There's something to be said for seasoned franchise filmmakers knowing how to build an entire universe. The Duffer Brothers, the creators of \"Stranger Things,\" were never that.\n\nSo, was it worth the wait? We'd argue no. We're begging for shows like \"Severance\" to get a more traditional release schedule to avoid wearing out the audience's welcome.\n\nDid \"Suits\" really need to continue after Meghan Markle and Patrick J. Adams left in season seven?\n\nThe show's premise — that Adams' character Mike would be able to stay at a top law firm without a law degree for years without anyone important finding out — was always ridiculous, but the banter between Mike, his boss Harvey (Gabriel Macht), Harvey's secretary Donna (Sarah Rafferty), and paralegal Rachel (Markle), was impossible not to like.\n\nBut when real-life circumstances forced Markle to leave the show — like a royal wedding — Rachel and Mike were written off in the finale of season seven.\n\nAs the relationship between Mike and Harvey was the beating heart of \"Suits,\" it was never the same after they were gone, and the show only lasted two more seasons.\n\nThe 22nd season of \"Grey's Anatomy\" returns this month, but it has overstayed its welcome.\n\nMillions of people watch \"Grey's Anatomy,\" even after 21 years of deaths, breakups, and every natural disaster you could think of — and this show was just supposed to be about a group of surgical interns and their relationship drama!\n\nIt's hard to pinpoint when the saga of Seattle Grace Mercy West/Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital should have ended. After season five, when Katherine Heigl and T. R. Knight left? Or after season eight, when Chyler Leigh and Eric Dane decided to flee Seattle? It almost definitely should have been done after Sandra Oh left in season 10. Or you could argue that it should've been when Justin Chambers, aka the heart of the show, Alex Karev, left in season 16.\n\nHowever, now that Meredith Grey herself, Ellen Pompeo, has decided that it's time to leave Grey Sloan, it's time to pack it up.\n\nThe point is, \"Grey's Anatomy\" has been on the air way too long.\n\n\"Westworld\" was unceremoniously canceled by HBO in 2021 after four seasons, even though the show had at one point been a prestige hit and only needed one more season to wrap up its sprawling story, according to its creators.\n\nAnd now that \"Westworld\" will never get to finish its story, there's an argument to be made that it should've been a one-season limited series.\n\nBut as Business Insider's Kim Renfro pointed out, being a \"Westworld\" fan has been exhausting since season two's extremely confusing, aspect ratio-changing, time-jumping story premiered.\n\nThe first season, now, remains a perfectly entertaining season about a theme park version of the Wild West for the mega-rich who thrived off hurting the park's android population. There was much to dissect about AI, what it means to be human, and how much darkness one person can carry without losing their mind.\n\nRIP, \"Westworld,\" we barely knew you … because we had no idea what was going on half the time.\n\n\"Homeland\" is another example of a show that could've been a limited series but dragged on for eight seasons total.\n\nSpoilers ahead for a show that wrapped up its eighth and final season in 2020. And we're going to tell you a hard truth: Damian Lewis' Nicholas Brody should've died at the end of season one, and that should've been the conclusion of his and CIA case officer Carrie Mathison's story.\n\nInstead, Lewis' chemistry with Claire Danes, who played Carrie Mathison, was so strong that the show kept putting off the inevitable, spinning its wheels until his death in season three.\n\nThen, even though their relationship was the heart of the show, \"Homeland\" went on for five more seasons, each with diminishing returns.\n\n\"The Big Bang Theory\" mercifully pulled the plug after 12 seasons in 2019 and approximately one million \"Bazingas.\"\n\n\"TBBT\" was a pleasant enough show about a group of nerds (and one \"dumb\" woman), but it became way too hacky as the years went by.\n\nSheldon was reduced to a sentient pile of catchphrases (Bazinga, the soft kitty song, to name a couple), and the on/off relationship of Penny and Leonard lost its spark.\n\nThat it went on for 12 seasons, while other underrated comedies got canceled way too soon — looking at you \"Party Down,\" \"Selfie,\" and \"Happy Endings\" — is probably its biggest crime.\n\nWhile we could all use a little more President Bartlet in our lives, it's undeniable that the show lost its true magic when Sorkin, who essentially wrote every script, left after the fourth season in 2003.\n\nThat season could have been a logical endpoint to the series, with Bartlet securing a second term, and the rest of his staff living to see another day.\n\nInstead, the show soldiered on for another three seasons. None of them are bad, but they failed to achieve the same transcendence of Sorkin's episodes, before ending in 2006.\n\n\"Scrubs\" is frequently cited by medical professionals as the most realistic medical show portraying life as a doctor in a hospital, as Slate reported.\n\nIt also provided us with many laughs — and almost as many tears — across its seven seasons on NBC. The network canceled it, and ABC swooped in to pick it up for season eight in 2008.\n\nCreator Bill Lawrence provided fans with a beautiful finale that saw all of our favorite characters riding off into the sunset. Or so it seemed.\n\nABC commissioned one more season of \"Scrubs,\" known unofficially as \"Scrubs Med.\" The show was moved from a hospital to a medical school, only three of the original cast continued to star, and a bunch of new characters were introduced, much to the chagrin of audiences.\n\nThankfully, the show was really canceled after that in 2010, and many fans don't even acknowledge it as canon.\n\nBut, guess what? In 2026, we're heading back to Sacred Heart for a 10th season with Zach Braff, Donald Faison, Sarah Chalke, John C. McGinley, and Judy Reyes, so maybe we'll be taking this show off the list soon.\n\n\"Friends\" is one of the most beloved TV shows of all time, which is why it's painful to admit that it lasted at least one season too long.\n\nGranted, the show revolved around a group of six friends, so storylines were in short supply. But when Rachel and Joey started dating in season 10, after nine seasons of having no interest in each other whatsoever, it became clear that the writers had run out of material.\n\nAdditionally, the characters became loud, obnoxious caricatures of themselves. Try watching an episode from the first season of \"Friends,\" and then one from the 10th season — the differences are startling.\n\nWhen Variety reported in 2015 that HBO was adapting Liane Moriarty's best-selling novel \"Big Little Lies,\" starring Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Shailene Woodley, Laura Dern, and Zoë Kravitz, the expectations could not have been higher.\n\nAnd when it premiered in 2017, it lived up to all of them. The cast had amazing chemistry, the story was well-paced and sufficiently ominous, and the soundtrack was superb.\n\nWhen \"Big Little Lies\" won multiple Emmys in the limited-series category, it became clear that there were no plans to artificially extend the story past what Moriarty had written in the book.\n\nBut two years later, we were back in Monterey. Even though season two gave us Meryl Streep's screaming, \"Big Little Lies\" should've stayed a limited series.\n\nHollywood, stop doing this! If your show was based on a single book, it almost never pays off to extend the story — there's a reason the author didn't write a sequel.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the long-threatened third season will actually happen.\n\nThere are some who argue that there shouldn't have even been one season of \"13 Reasons Why,\" a Netflix show based on the novel of the same name. Critics claimed the show, which premiered in 2017, \"glorified\" suicide and sent the wrong message to teens.\n\nBut whether you agree with it or not, even the biggest fans of the show have to admit that the story after season one went completely off the rails.\n\nThis show started as the story of Hannah Baker (Katherine Langford), a teenager struggling with anxiety and depression, who recorded 13 tapes, each dedicated to a different person she blamed for her eventual suicide.\n\nBut by the time season four rolled around in 2020, Hannah was long forgotten, and the show had turned into a murder-mystery thriller with extra trauma thrown in for no discernible reason, as NME wrote.\n\nIf you were on Twitter (now X) during an episode of \"Pretty Little Liars,\" you might remember how captivating this show about a group of friends getting terrorized by an anonymous stalker named \"A\" used to be — it was a phenomenon.\n\nBut the show's runaway success led to it promising to reveal who the real \"A\" was every single season. Even though the identity of \"A\" was revealed in season two, more \"As\" popped up every season.\n\nHow many \"As\" could there be? The show only got more confusing as it went on, and mercifully ended after season seven in 2017 — though there were also two spinoffs.\n\n\"The Vampire Diaries\" probably should have called it quits after the show's star, Nina Dobrev, left in season six. It finally ended two years later.\n\n\"The Vampire Diaries\" originally started as a love triangle between Elena (played by Dobrev) and two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon, but as seasons went on, the show lost focus.\n\nStill, it kept going and doubled down on the (polarizing) romance between Damon and Elena. Arguably, it was never able to recreate its storytelling highs of season two.\n\nThe show's sixth season ended with Elena in a coma, and curiously continued without her for another two unnecessary seasons.\n\nWithout Elena, the main character, the show struggled, and finally came to an end after season eight in 2017 — though you could continue some characters' journeys on \"The Originals\" and \"Legacies\" until they ended in 2018 and 2022, respectively.\n\n\"One Tree Hill,\" a show about a group of high school friends in a small North Carolina town called Tree Hill, would have been great if it had said goodbye after high school graduation.\n\nThe post-high school stretch of \"OTH\" just had way too much going on, becoming confusing and soap opera-esque.\n\nThe show attempted to bypass the college problem that many high school TV shows encounter by jumping four years into the future, which was inventive at first, but became sort of ridiculous: the high level of success and fame this one group of friends had achieved was unbelievable.\n\nIt ended in 2012 after season nine, arguably five years after its prime.\n\nIn 2024, Variety reported that stars Sophia Bush and Hilarie Burton were working on an \"OTH\" revival with Netflix, so there might be more yet.\n\n\"Scandal\" became increasingly ridiculous and soapy as time went on, ultimately concluding in 2018.\n\nIt could be argued that the show never recovered from the introduction of the all-knowing, super-scary Black-Ops intelligence organization, B-613.\n\nThat's when \"Scandal\" pivoted from a political case-of-the-week drama with an ongoing love story between political \"fixer\" Olivia Pope and the US president to a frankly unwatchable soap opera in which every character either became a murderer or died, and spent most of their time yelling at someone.\n\n\"Once Upon a Time\" was rightfully canceled in 2018 after its low-rated seventh season. The show had tried to continue after ditching six of its main characters, but it would have made more sense to pull the plug.\n\nThe premise of \"Once Upon a Time\" — that fairytale characters are all real and living in a fictional town in Maine — was interesting for a season or two, but as the show went on, the connections between characters became more and more unbelievable. Plus, by the end, basically every character on the show was somehow related.\n\n\"Family Guy's\" creator, Seth MacFarlane, admitted that he has conflicting ideas about his show. In 2011, MacFarlane told The Hollywood Reporter, \"Part of me thinks that 'Family Guy' should have already ended. I think seven seasons is about the right lifespan for a TV series.\"\n\nIt's hard to argue with that, especially since the misadventures of the Rhode Island-dwelling Griffin family are wearing a little thin these days.\n\nHowever, season 24 is set to kick off in February, and as Variety reported, the show is guaranteed to air through season 29.\n\n\"Glee\" really started to go off the rails when some of the original characters graduated high school.\n\nThinking about \"Glee\" in 2023 is difficult, considering the tragedy of Cory Monteith's overdose, Naya Rivera's unexpected death, and the death of Mark Salling, who was charged with the possession of child-sexual-abuse material.\n\nBut the show probably should have taken its final bow after a couple of seasons. In a review of the 2015 series finale for Vox, one critic even wrote that the show \"got bad\" in its second episode.\n\nThe novelty of turning popular songs into show choir performances wore off quickly, and the show's replacement characters in season four, after much of the Glee Club graduated from high school, never quite worked.\n\nMany people claim that the 2012 reveal that Dan Humphrey, resident New York City \"Lonely Boy,\" was actually Gossip Girl ruined the show for them … but the show was pretty ruined long before that.\n\n\"Gossip Girl\" is an example of a show not being sustainable after the high school years. It didn't make sense that all of the main characters went to college in Manhattan: Blair, Serena, Nate, and Dan had all expressed their desire to leave the city for college.\n\nPlus, by season four, it didn't make sense for any of them to still be hanging out together. They all openly hated each other.\n\nIf there's one thing fans can agree on, it's that the final season of \"Gilmore Girls\" — a show about a young mother-daughter pair in small-town Connecticut — is a mess, due to the show's heart and soul, writer and producer Amy Sherman-Palladino, leaving in 2006.\n\nBut some argue that the mediocrity of season seven is actually her fault. Season six was a radical departure from the hijinks of perpetually happy town \"Stars Hollow,\" and instead focused on Rory and her mom not speaking, and the slow, painful demise of Luke and Lorelai's engagement.\n\nThe 2016 Netflix reboot \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" somehow made it even worse, showing that Rory had gone through little to no personal growth since the show ended, and that Lorelai and Luke had made no progress on their communication issues that had been present since their romance first began in season five.\n\n\"24\" had an innovative premise: Each week's episode was in real time, and each season covered a single day. But it definitely didn't need eight seasons, a 2008 TV movie, a 2014 revival, and a 2017 spin-off.\n\nRealistically, how many seasons of CTU (Counter Terrorist Unit) agent Jack Bauer saving the world, getting betrayed, torturing someone, and getting chased by the federal government can you watch? At least nine, its creators thought.\n\n\"24,\" which was initially praised for its inventive structure and its willingness to kill main characters and take big risks, got old pretty quickly.\n\nBut the show became formulaic after a couple of years, and the amount of pain and suffering each \"day\" put Jack through became unnecessary — his wife, four girlfriends, father, and brother are all killed over the course of the show.\n\nOne of the pillars of the Superman canon is that Clark becomes Superman when he moves to Metropolis from his small town of, well, Smallville.\n\nBut \"Smallville\" didn't get that memo, because Clark moves to Metropolis in season five with no red cape in sight. He didn't even wear the suit until the 2011 series finale (which is also when he finally learned to fly).\n\nYes, it took \"Smallville\" an excruciating 10 seasons for Clark Kent to finally become Superman.\n\nTo be fair, the creators of \"Smallville\" probably had no idea that the show would last for 10 seasons when they instituted their \"No tights, no flights\" policy, but that doesn't make it any less annoying.\n\n\"That '70s Show\" took place from 1976 to 1979, but the show lasted for eight seasons. It took five years for the core crew to graduate high school, so naturally, the show began to drag. You can only watch a group of friends sit in a basement and get stoned for so long.\n\nBut the show should have ended for good when Topher Grace, who played the main character Eric Forman, chose to leave after season seven in 2005.\n\nThen, Ashton Kutcher, who played Kelso, left after the first four episodes of season eight — and was replaced by an almost universally hated character named Randy (sorry, Josh Meyers!).\n\nFans were also angry when Fez and Jackie began a relationship, seemingly out of nowhere, effectively ending the fan-favorite relationship between Jackie and Hyde.\n\nEven though the 2023 sequel series \"That '90s Show\" (which was canceled after two seasons) confirmed that Jackie and Kelso got back together and brought back Eric, we'd be fine without it.\n\nIt became apparent that \"The Office\" was running out of stories to tell after Jim and Pam finally got married in the show's sixth season. The writers kept throwing unrealistic obstacles at them, such as a random cameraman who was suddenly in love with Pam. Adding such a melodramatic plot to a workplace sitcom like \"The Office\" (about a paper company in Pennsylvania) didn't make any sense.\n\nBut the final nail in the coffin of \"The Office\" was Steve Carell's decision to exit after seven seasons as the lovably incompetent Michael Scott.\n\nSeason eight was the first season of the sitcom to achieve a rotten score on Rotten Tomatoes. It would have been better to go out on a high note.\n\nUrban Dictionary defines jumping the shark as \"a term to describe a moment when something that was once great has reached a point where it will now decline in quality and popularity.\"\n\nWhere did such an oddly specific expression come from? Look no further than the season five premiere of \"Happy Days,\" in which Fonzie, played by Henry Winkler, literally jumps over a shark on water-skis. This stunt left people confused — wasn't this supposed to be a show about small-town '50s nostalgia?\n\n\"Happy Days\" lasted for 11 seasons from 1974 to 1984, but many people cite the jumping of the shark as a turning point in \"Happy Days\" history.\n\n\"Weeds,\" a show about a suburban single mom who grows and sells marijuana to support her family, started with such promise. It was a fascinating look at what goes on behind closed doors in suburbia — until it became more focused on drug cartels, murder, and generally unpleasant subject matter.\n\nSeasons one and two, in which Nancy (Mary-Louise Parker) is a low-level marijuana dealer in the small California town of Agrestic, are nearly perfect.\n\nBut when the show crossed the border into Mexico? Not so much.\n\nIt's borderline impossible to find someone who watched \"Weeds\" all the way until the end in 2012, when it became way too dark to enjoy.\n\n\"True Blood\" kicked off the vampire craze in 2008, a month before \"Twilight\" hit the big screen, and a year before \"The Vampire Diaries\" premiered on The CW.\n\nAnd for three seasons, it was a campy, bloody, sexy show about Sookie, a psychic waitress, her complicated relationships with hot vampires, and the lives of her family and friends.\n\nBut \"True Blood\" went downhill after it was revealed that Sookie was a fairy. She described it best when she found out the news: \"I'm a fairy? How ... lame.\"\n\nAfter this reveal, the writers scrambled to find more ways to integrate other mythological creatures, with little success.\n\nOriginal showrunner Alan Ball abandoned ship after season five, according to The Hollywood Reporter, and \"True Blood\" should have gone down with him.\n\nThe show ended on a low note in 2014, which is something that fans are still angry about to this day.\n\n\"How I Met Your Mother\" should not have gone on for nine years, simply because taking nine seasons to tell one story is almost cruel to viewers — especially the eagle-eyed, devoted fans who spent years dissecting every episode looking for clues and Easter eggs as to the identity of the titular mother.\n\nThe slow pace of the story angered both Ted's kids and fans, and the show became less funny over time.\n\nMaybe if the show had spent only four or five years building up the mother, as opposed to almost an entire decade, fans would have been able to swallow Ted and Robin (his ex-girlfriend and best friend's ex-wife) ending up together, instead of raging that it was one of the worst endings of all time.\n\nDexter was a serial killer who trained himself to only kill bad guys, but the show became less appealing, and more unrealistic, especially when writers increasingly tried to humanize Dexter.\n\nEven if you were rooting for Dexter, it became impossible to watch him face no consequences for his actions — every time someone came close to exposing him, someone else killed the threat, instead of Dexter being forced to abandon his moral code to kill an innocent person.\n\nAdditionally, the 2013 series finale has become widely regarded as one of the worst ever, although it was slightly redeemed by the subsequent revivals and prequel: \"Dexter: New Blood,\" \"Dexter: Original Sin,\" and \"Dexter: Resurrection.\"\n\nWhen \"Modern Family\" premiered in 2009, it was universally loved by fans and critics, as evidenced by high Rotten Tomatoes scores.\n\nIn fact, it was nominated for best comedy series at the Emmys seven years in a row, winning five consecutive years. It was a true 21st-century comedy, telling the story of a giant family that includes a gay couple, an interracial couple, divorce, and adoption.\n\nHowever, when it lost the award for the first time in 2015, it should've been a clue that it was probably time to start wrapping things up. Yet, the show continued, and even though it wasn't nominated for anything in 2018, it soldiered on for a 10th season.\n\nThe show finally ended in April 2020.\n\n\"Desperate Housewives\" began in 2004 as an intriguing mystery about a group of friends who were rocked by their friend Mary Alice's shocking suicide.\n\nBut as the years went by, characters became more unlikable and plots more nonsensical — remember when Edie was electrocuted after surviving a car crash? Eight seasons were just too much time to invest in the ladies of Wisteria Lane.\n\nOne of the show's titular two-and-a-half men, Charlie Sheen, left the show after eight seasons in 2011. He was dismissed after insulting the show and its creator, Chuck Lorre, Deadline reported, amongst other things, during a public meltdown.\n\nThe sitcom — about a wimpy chiropractor Alan, his underachieving son Jake, and his ladies' man brother Charlie — soldiered on for four more seasons by replacing Charlie with a depressed billionaire, Walden, who was played by Ashton Kutcher.\n\nThe show ended on a low note in 2015, with IGN writing \"don't think [we] could come up with a worse ending.\"\n\nThe truth is, the show was already in a downward spiral before Sheen left, but his departure should have been the final nail in the coffin.\n\nIn the end, it turns out \"Supernatural\" isn't immortal, like so many of its characters.\n\nThe show dealt with all sorts of otherworldly creatures, such as angels, demons, vampires, werewolves, and leprechauns, among others, and two brothers (Dean and Sam Winchester) were tasked with eradicating the world from these evils.\n\nNot many, if any, shows can remain fresh for 300 episodes. There's only so many times someone can go to hell and back before it loses its oomph, which is probably why the show ended after 15 years.\n\nIt's always a risky move when shows finally let their central couple be together — the romantic tension is usually much more fun.\n\n\"Castle\" started in 2009 as a procedural about a smarmy mystery novelist, the titular Castle, tagging along with a no-nonsense homicide detective, Beckett. The two had chemistry, and for four seasons, they danced around their obvious feelings for each other.\n\nBut when the two finally got together, the show lost some of its mojo. The show had to twist itself into knots to inject conflict into their relationship instead of letting them be happy, frustrating fans to no end throughout the next four seasons until its end in 2016.",

    "description": "Taylor Swift's new single \"The Fate of Ophelia\" debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, joining hits like \"Blank Space\" and \"Anti-Hero.\"",
    "fullText": "Despite writing ubiquitous hits like \"You Belong With Me\" and \"Love Story\" earlier in her career (which peaked at No. 2 and No. 4, respectively), \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" was Swift's first-ever song to top the Hot 100.\n\nThe country-pop crossover smash was released as the lead single from Swift's fourth album, \"Red.\" It rose from No. 72 to No. 1 in its second week of tracking and remained atop the chart for two more weeks.\n\n\"Shake It Off\" was released as the lead single from Swift's fifth album, \"1989.\" It became her first No. 1 debut on the Hot 100.\n\n\"Blank Space,\" the second single from \"1989,\" debuted at No. 18 on the Hot 100.\n\nIt rose to No. 13 before soaring to No. 1 in its third week — dethroning \"Shake It Off\" and making Swift the first woman in history to replace herself in the chart's top spot.\n\n\"Blank Space\" went on to become one of Swift's biggest hits, reigning atop the chart for nearly two months.\n\nDespite mixed reactions from critics, Swift's lead single from \"Reputation\" rose to No. 1 after its first full week of tracking, breaking the weekly streaming record for a song by a woman.\n\nOnce again, Swift's music video broke the record for most views within 24 hours, racking up 43.2 million views in its first day.\n\nSwift announced the arrival of her eighth album, \"Folklore,\" just one day in advance. The second track, \"Cardigan,\" was released at the same time as the album and promoted with a whimsical music video.\n\n\"Folklore\" debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 while \"Cardigan\" simultaneously debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, making Swift the first artist in history to open atop both charts in the same week.\n\nJust five months after \"Folklore,\" Swift repeated her pandemic-era strategy and surprise-released her ninth album, \"Evermore,\" alongside its lead single.\n\nAgain, \"Willow\" debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100 while \"Evermore\" simultaneously debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.\n\n\"Red (Taylor's Version)\" was the second rerecorded album Swift released. It was accompanied by the long-awaited 10-minute version of \"All Too Well,\" a fan-favorite track from the original album.\n\n\"All Too Well (Taylor's Version)\" was promoted with a self-directed short film and plenty of theories about the song's most likely muse.\n\nIt debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, becoming the longest song in history to top the chart. The record was previously held by Don McLean's \"American Pie (Parts I & II)\" at 8 minutes and 37 seconds.\n\n\"Anti-Hero\" was released alongside Swift's 10th album, \"Midnights,\" and promoted as the lead single.\n\nIt dominated the Hot 100 for eight weeks, surpassing the high-water mark set by \"Blank Space.\"\n\nThe same week that \"Anti-Hero\" debuted at No. 1, Swift became the first and only artist in history to occupy the entire top 10 on the Hot 100. The hit single was flanked by \"Lavender Haze\" (No. 2), \"Maroon\" (No. 3), \"Snow on the Beach\" (No. 4), \"Midnight Rain\" (No. 5), \"Bejeweled\" (No. 6), \"Question...?\" (No. 7), \"You're On Your Own, Kid\" (No. 8), \"Karma\" (No. 9), and \"Vigilante Shit\" (No. 10).\n\n\"Cruel Summer\" was originally released as the second track on Swift's 2019 album \"Lover.\"\n\nAlthough it was identified early as a fan favorite, the song was never promoted as a single and debuted modestly at No. 29 on the Hot 100.\n\nFour years later, Swift transformed \"Cruel Summer\" into a showstopping spectacle on the Eras Tour. Streams of the song began to surge, and it reigned atop Billboard's Pop Airplay chart for two months. Swift's label sent the song to pop radio in June 2023.\n\nFinally, following the release of \"The Cruelest Summer\" EP — which includes a live version of the song and a remix by LP Giobbi — the song reached No. 1 on the Hot 100, marking Swift's milestone 10th chart-topper.\n\n\"Is It Over Now?\" was released as the final vault track on \"1989 (Taylor's Version),\" a rerecording of her beloved fifth album.\n\nAlthough it wasn't initially slated as a single, its enthusiastic reception from fans pushed Swift's team to serve the song to pop radio.\n\n\"Is It Over Now?\" debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, dethroning \"Cruel Summer.\" Swift remains the only woman in history to replace herself in the top spot, a feat she's now achieved twice.\n\n\"Fortnight,\" a duet with Post Malone, was released alongside \"The Tortured Poets Department\" and promoted as the album's lead single.\n\nThe song debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100 while \"Poets\" simultaneously debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.\n\nFor the second time in her career, Swift managed to occupy the entire top 10 of the Hot 100. In fact, the top 14 positions on the chart were occupied by \"Poets\" tracks, including \"Down Bad\" (No. 2) and \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart\" (No. 3), all the way through to \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\" (No. 14).\n\n\"Fortnight\" returned to No. 1 on the Hot 100 for a second consecutive week.\n\n\"The Fate of Ophelia\" was released alongside Swift's 12th studio album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" and promoted as the lead single.\n\nThe Shakespeare-inspired pop song debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, while \"Showgirl\" simultaneously debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, breaking a record for the biggest sales week of all time.\n\nAll 12 tracks on the album debuted within the Hot 100's top 12 spots, making Swift the first and only artist to dominate the chart's top 10 on three separate occasions. \"The Fate of Ophelia\" was joined in the top five by \"Opalite\" (No. 2), \"Elizabeth Taylor\" (No. 3), \"Father Figure\" (No. 4), and \"Wood\" (No. 5).\n\n\"The Fate of Ophelia\" remained atop the Hot 100 for eight straight weeks after its release. After falling to lower positions during the holiday season, it returned to No. 1 for its ninth week, surpassing \"Anti-Hero\" as Swift's longest-leading hit to date.",

    "title": "The investor who blocked a $9 billion AI deal expects that bet to soon pay off",
    "description": "Shareholders voted down a takeover bid for Core Scientific late last year because it wasn't rich enough. Here's why they think the bet will pay off.",
    "fullText": "The investment manager who helped scuttle one of the biggest data center acquisitions of 2025 believes that his bet against the multibillion-dollar buyout is about to pay off in the new year.\n\nTrip Miller, the founder and managing partner of the Memphis-based investment firm Gullane Capital Partners, believes that Core Scientific, a data center developer and operator, is on the cusp of large new customer deals that will boost its value.\n\n\"I think over the next 90 days, you'll see them announce greater than a hundred megawatts of deals,\" Miller said. \"It would show that there was a lot more value to be tapped there than we were getting paid for under the CoreWeave deal.\"\n\nIn October, Miller, a major shareholder in Core Scientific, opposed an offer by the artificial intelligence cloud firm CoreWeave to acquire Core Scientific in a stock conversion deal that he felt undervalued the company. The purchase was originally valued at around $9 billion when it was announced in July, but fell to almost half of that when shares of CoreWeave dipped in the ensuing months. Shareholders in the firm rejected the deal in a vote on October 30 that reflected the concerns over the deal's weakened economics.\n\nMiller said that his expectation for the roughly 100 megawatts of near-term commitments was based on conversations he has had with knowledgeable parties outside of the company's management. He projected that the company will find takers for a total of roughly 400 megawatts this year, citing strong demand for AI computing power.\n\nAsked about the potential for upcoming leasing, a spokeswoman for Core Scientific said the company \"does not comment on market rumors or speculation.\"\n\nThe commitments, if they materialize, would show that data center developers with a runway for growth are increasingly valuable in an energy-constrained building boom.\n\nCore Scientific has disclosed that it has about 1 gigawatt of data center capacity and another 1.5 gigawatts of power for expansion, according to an October investor presentation.\n\nIt would also offer a competing view that the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent on data centers, computer chips, and power infrastructure are in support of a durable AI boom, not a bubble.\n\n\"We are in a situation where we're likely to be systematically short compute —where the demand for compute will outstrip the supply,\" Stephen Byrd, Morgan Stanley's global head of thematic research and sustainability research, said.\n\nIn a report published in December, Morgan Stanley suggested that one of the most significant hurdles for the AI industry will be the gargantuan loads of power required to drive its computing.\n\nMorgan Stanley projects that data centers, the vast facilities that handle the training for large language AI models and the inference computations that put them to work in everyday applications, face a 47 gigawatt shortfall of electricity from the grid nationally by 2028 — a gap almost 10 times the size of New York City's energy footprint on an average day.\n\nAmong the chief beneficiaries are crypto mining firms that have access to in-place power and utility contracts to light up new facilities quickly.\n\nBoth Core Scientific and CoreWeave were former crypto mining companies before repurposing their businesses to focus on AI in recent years.\n\nAmid the mounting shortage of power — along with headwinds in the crypto mining business — more of the industry is turning to data center computing.\n\nByrd said Morgan Stanley anticipates that about 12 gigawatts of mining facilities, about 60% the mining industry's current gigawattage, will convert over to AI and high-performance computing in the next three years.\n\nIn September, Cipher Mining announced it would build a data center in Colorado City, Texas, with 168 megawatts of computing capacity that will be leased to the AI cloud company, Fluidstack. Cipher's stock, which had been trading in August for around $5 a share, jumped as high as roughly $25 in November after the announcement.\n\nIren, another mining firm, announced a recent $9.7 billion AI cloud computing deal with Microsoft. Last month, Hut 8, said it had signed a deal to lease a 245-megawatt data center it is developing in Louisiana to Fluidstack.\n\n\"Our view is that crypto miners, by and large, are likely to pivot for the most part to delivering high-performance compute infrastructure solutions and services,\" Paul Golding, an analyst at Macquarie who covers the crypto mining industry, said.\n\nIn July 2025, CoreWeave said it had reached an agreement to acquire Core Scientific in a stock conversion. But in the months after the announcement, CoreWeave's shares declined and Core Scientific's rose, effectively reducing the value of CoreWeave's offer.\n\nSince the deal's collapse, shares of Core Scientific have traded as low as below $14 a share — less than the $17 per share price that the CoreWeave deal would have amounted to.\n\nGolding covers Core Scientific and has set a $34 target for the company's stock in October, more than double its current market price — upside that he sees stemming from its ability to tap power in a constrained utility market. That estimate is \"based on a sum of the parts that evaluated potential value for the uncontracted megawatts in the portfolio, the megawatt pipeline in load study phase, and the existing co-location deal with CoreWeave,\" Golding said.\n\nCoreWeave is Core Scientific's only data center customer, outside of legacy crypto mining facilities it operates. Core Scientific leases 590 megawatts to CoreWeave, worth roughly $10 billion in revenue over the next 12 years, according to a spokeswoman for the company. It plans to repurpose 400 megawatts of its crypto mining operations over to high-performance computing in the next three years, the spokeswoman said.\n\nMiller said that the upcoming leases he expects Core Scientific to announce will be with new customers.\n\n\"I expect them to announce deals for AI with third parties other than CoreWeave,\" Miller said.",

    "fullText": "Meta has hired C.J. Mahoney, a former senior Microsoft legal executive and onetime Trump administration official, as its next chief legal officer, Axios reported.\n\nMahoney will replace Jennifer Newstead, who announced in December that she would leave Meta after more than five years to become Apple's general counsel. Mahoney is set to start on Wednesday and will report directly to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the Axios report said.\n\n\"I'm excited to join Meta as it leads the way in AI innovation and continues to connect people around the world,\" Mahoney said in a statement that Meta shared with Business Insider. \"As I close an incredible chapter at Microsoft and begin a new one at Meta, I'm grateful for the trust Mark and the Board have placed in me.\"\n\n\"C.J. brings world-class legal expertise, passion for frontier technology, and deep insight into the global regulatory challenges facing our industry,\" said Zuckerberg in a statement shared with Business Insider. \"I'm looking forward to working with him to advance Meta's mission to build the future of human connection.\"\n\nMahoney previously served as Microsoft's corporate vice president and deputy general counsel and earlier worked as deputy US trade representative during President Donald Trump's first term.\n\nIn his new role, he will oversee Meta's global legal strategy as the company continues to face scrutiny over antitrust, data privacy, online safety, and the protection of children and teenagers.\n\nNewstead's departure marked the end of a consequential period for Meta's legal team. During her tenure, the company secured a major win against the Federal Trade Commission when a federal judge rejected the agency's attempt to force Meta to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nMahoney's appointment comes as Meta continues to navigate intensifying regulatory pressure worldwide, including debates over artificial intelligence, social media governance, and data protection.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "MrBeast is blurring the lines between YouTube and TV in a new way with the release of season two of his reality TV hit, \"Beast Games,\" on Amazon's Prime Video.\n\nThe superstar YouTuber, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, announced that the first episode will be copyright-free. That'll enable people to share reaction clips to their heart's content without fear of repercussions on platforms like Google's YouTube and Amazon's Twitch. The show kicks off on Wednesday.\n\nIt's only for one episode, but it gives MrBeast a way to have his TV cake and eat it, too — and for Amazon to juice exposure for the show.\n\nThe Amazon deal exposed MrBeast to a new audience and enabled him to create a big-budget spectacle that would have been difficult to make economically viable if it ran on YouTube. However, a potential risk was that MrBeast's fans might not follow him to Prime Video, which is behind a paywall requiring a Prime membership.\n\nLast year, MrBeast uploaded part of the first season to YouTube to ensure his fans on that platform were aware of it. MrBeast is YouTube's top creator, with over 450 million subscribers, and regularly receives more than 100 million views and numerous comments on his YouTube videos.\n\nTraditional media companies, such as Netflix and Fox, have been trying to stay relevant with younger viewers by striking deals with YouTube creators. The loss of fan interaction and decreased reach are concerns for some creators, though. In negotiating deals with podcasters, Netflix has told talent agents that it's exploring how to replicate community features for podcast hosts that it brings onto its platform.\n\nSeason 2 of \"Beast Games,\" which features 100 \"strong\" and 100 \"smart\" contestants competing for more than $10 million in prizes, blends elements of TV and digital platforms in other ways.\n\nIt'll include a crossover episode with \"Survivor,\" the famous reality TV show that \"Beast Games\" took inspiration from. And Twitch is promoting the season kickoff with a VIP screening on Tuesday featuring streamers alongside MrBeast.",

    "fullText": "Satellite imagery released in the aftermath of US airstrikes launched in support of the operation to apprehend Nicolás Maduro shows damage beyond a major military base.\n\nA satellite photo taken on Saturday by the US commercial imaging company Planet Labs PBC and obtained by Business Insider shows damage at the Higuerote Airport on Venezuela's northern coast, several dozen miles east of the capital Caracas.\n\nA crater or burn mark can be seen adjacent to the eastern end of the runway, and another on the apron near a collection of buildings.\n\nVideo shared on social media appeared to show explosions and fires at Higuerote Airport during the surprise US operation, Absolute Resolve, which began late Friday night and continued for several more hours into Saturday morning.\n\nVenezuela's air defenses are primarily comprised of Russian-made technology. US fighter jets, surveillance planes, bombers, and drones targeted these systems at the beginning of the raid, effectively clearing a path for low-flying helicopter apprehension forces to locate and capture the former president, Maduro, and his wife.\n\n\"Seems those Russian air defenses didn't quite work so well, did they?\" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said during remarks at the Newport News Shipyard in Virginia on Monday.\n\nIn addition to the damage seen at Higuerote Airport, satellite imagery taken by the US spatial intelligence firm Vantor revealed significant damage to buildings and equipment at Fuerte Tiuna, a major military installation in Caracas that houses defense ministries, critical commands, official residences, and other strategic infrastructure.\n\nConflict analysts at the Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank, said that geolocated footage indicated American forces also targeted port infrastructure, telecommunication towers, and an airbase in and around Caracas.\n\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment on the targets struck during Operation Absolute Resolve. The White House directed BI to the Saturday press briefing on the mission.\n\nMore than 150 US aircraft participated in the mission to capture Maduro, which relied on months of extensive planning and rehearsal, including building a replica of Maduro's compound that American personnel stormed. US intelligence agencies had mapped out details and patterns of his life in advance.\n\nThe operation marked a dramatic culmination of months of rising tensions between the Trump administration and Maduro, whom the US has accused of facilitating drug trafficking and other criminal activity. The ousted leader is now in New York facing narco-terrorism charges. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe US established a large military presence in the Caribbean over the past few months, deploying an aircraft carrier strike group, cruisers, destroyers, advanced fighter jets, and thousands of troops.\n\nSince early September, the US has carried out dozens of airstrikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, killing more than 100 people in a campaign that drew sharp criticism from lawmakers and legal experts.\n\nIt is unclear how long the US will maintain this force presence in the region. President Donald Trump issued warnings to several neighboring countries over the weekend — including Cuba, Colombia, and Mexico — raising concerns of additional military action. He has also threatened Venezuela with follow-on strikes if it doesn't cooperate.",

These types of programs have become particularly important to sportsbooks, which compete fiercely with each other for VIPs.\n\n\"Similar to other financial markets, brokerages, and large consumer brands, we're piloting a program that offers priority support and other benefits to some of our most loyal customers,\" a Kalshi spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nKalshi and its top rival, Polymarket, have become popular by allowing users to make money by trading contracts about the outcomes of events like elections, world events, and sports games. Kalshi announced that it had reached an $11 billion valuation in early December.\n\nUnlike sportsbooks, Kalshi operates in all 50 states and is regulated by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. However, some state regulators have targeted prediction markets like Kalshi, arguing that parts of their businesses should be overseen by gaming authorities. Kalshi disputes that notion. The company has received cease-and-desist orders from several state agencies.\n\nKalshi has recently raised its profile through data integration deals with CNBC and CNN. These networks and their websites will display data from Kalshi that shows what its users think are the probabilities of different market and economic outcomes. For example, CNN could show Kalshi prediction data about which political party users think will control the Senate after the 2026 midterm elections.",

    "description": "Business Insider is on the ground at Las Vegas CES 2026. Here's everything we learned on self-driving cars and robotaxis,",
    "fullText": "Business Insider is taking on CES 2026.\n\nI'm on the ground in Las Vegas from Tuesday to Thursday, taking in all there is to know about the latest in the driverless space.\n\nRobotaxis and self-driving cars have already had an outsize presence at the tech conference, especially in the previous hype cycle of the late 2010s and early 2020s.\n\nThings have changed since then. The industry has largely moved on from mere concepts and technology validation to: How are we going to realistically scale autonomy?\n\nIt's day one of the conference, and there's already a lot to take in.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang unveiled the Alpamayo family, which will serve as an autonomous-driving stack for OEMs to deal with those stubborn edge cases — or the \"long tail\" of self-driving.\n\nUber and Nuro showed off an early look at the Lucid Gravity SUV that the companies hope public riders will be able to take by late 2026.\n\nI'll be spending less time at keynotes and speaker events and more on real-life demonstrations and meetings with industry leaders and commentators in autonomy\n\nThink of this as my personal notebook, where I jot down everything I've learned and seen at the conference.\n\nCheck back in for more updates.\n\nThis is the first year Zoox, an Amazon-backed robotaxi company, will be giving live demonstrations of its service during CES.\n\nI got to take a ride in one on Monday night in front of Resorts World. (The company tagline that I saw from an ad at the Harry Reid International Airport was: \"Don't just do the Strip. Zoox it.\")\n\nMy immediate thoughts were that Zoox feels unlike any other robotaxi or pseudo-robotaxi on the market. It felt more like I was on a theme park ride than in an everyday car we're familiar with.\n\nUnlike Waymo's robotaxis, Zoox is not a regular car you could buy that's been retrofitted with sensors. The Zoox car is bi-directional — meaning there's no real front or back of the car — and the inside has no steering wheel, just seats.\n\nThe robotaxis were clearly a great tourist attraction from what I saw. My Uber driver wasn't too happy about them.\n\nUber, Lucid, and Nuro had a swanky cocktail hour at Fontainebleau Las Vegas, where they quite literally wined and dined a room full of reporters, analysts, and investors: endless glasses of wine and an open bar, lobster tails, jumbo shrimp, too many appetizers to count, and a giant charcuterie board — the works.\n\nMaybe understandably so? 2026 will be a big year for the three companies.\n\nUber's plan is to roll out a robotaxi service by late 2026. The first market is San Francisco, where Uber will directly compete with Waymo. These two companies are partners in other markets, like Austin.\n\n\"We've been moving very, very quickly,\" Nuro's co-CEO and cofounder Dave Ferguson said. \"We signed this partnership last July. We're already testing the production-intent vehicles on public roads. And very soon, we're going to have tens of thousands of them worldwide.\"",

    "fullText": "Lockheed Martin plans to dramatically ramp up production of Patriot missile interceptors, aiming to more than triple its annual output to 2,000, the defense contractor said on Tuesday.\n\nLockheed said that it had reached an agreement with the US Department of Defense to \"rapidly accelerate\" the production and delivery of its PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) interceptors over a seven-year period.\n\nThe new agreement will increase the annual production capacity of PAC-3, or Patriot Advanced Capability, interceptors from roughly 600 to 2,000. These will then be delivered to US, allied, and partner forces.\n\nGlobal demand for capable air defenses and interceptors has surged in recent years in response to the large missile attacks seen in Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine and in Middle East conflicts. The American-made MIM-104 Patriot air defense system has been at the center of both.\n\nThe surface-to-air missile system has served as the backbone of Ukraine's defense against Russian missile strikes, functioning as the top layer of an air defense network largely supported by Western-made technology. And the US military has relied on the Patriot to intercept Iranian attacks.\n\nThe high expenditure rate for Patriot interceptors over the last few years has raised concerns about future stockpiles for US and allied arsenals.\n\nJim Taiclet, Lockheed's chairman and CEO, said in a statement that the defense prime \"will create unprecedented capacity for PAC-3 MSE production, delivering at the speed our nation and allies demand.\"\n\nLockheed said that it had boosted PAC-3 MSE production by more than 60% over the past two years and delivered 620 missile interceptors in 2025, a 20% increase from 2024.\n\nThe contractor supplies 17 countries with its PAC-3 interceptors. It considers the MSE variant a \"cornerstone\" of US and European missile defense.\n\nThe Pentagon said that the agreement announced on Tuesday is a result of its new Acquisition Transformation Strategy, which Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth revealed in November and calls for increased production capacity for key weapons and munitions, among other priorities.\n\nHegseth said at the time that the Pentagon would award companies bigger and longer contracts for \"proven systems\" so that they could invest \n\nThe framework agreement announced on Tuesday \"establishes the basis for negotiating a seven-year supply contract\" that will still need Congressional approval, the Pentagon said.\n\n\"This framework agreement marks a fundamental shift in how we rapidly expand munitions production and magazine depth, and how we collaborate with our industry partners,\" said Michael Duffey, the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, in a statement.",

    "fullText": "Seven US service members were injured during the covert raid to apprehend Nicolás Maduro over the weekend, a defense official told Business Insider on Tuesday, sharing the latest update on their condition.\n\nFive of the wounded troops have already returned to duty, while two others are still recovering from their injuries, the official said.\n\n\"They are receiving excellent medical care and are well on their way to recovery,\" they said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump initially revealed Saturday morning, several hours after the operation had wrapped up, that \"a couple of guys were hit\" as US forces stormed Maduro's compound to apprehend Venezuela's now-former president and his wife, Cilia Flores.\n\nTrump later shared that all the injured service members were in \"good shape.\" He added that no US troops were killed, and no equipment was lost in this operation. A helicopter took a hit but remained operational.\n\n\"The fact that this extremely complex and grueling mission was successfully executed with so few injuries is a testament to the expertise of our joint warriors,\" the defense official said.\n\nIt's unclear what kind of injuries the troops sustained during the mission or how they were hurt. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, said on Monday that nearly 200 US personnel entered \"downtown Caracas\" as part of the operation.\n\nThe surprise US operation, called Absolute Resolve, followed months of extensive planning and rehearsal, including building a replica of Maduro's compound. On Saturday, Trump described the facility as a \"highly guarded\" building, \"like a fortress.\"\n\nLow-flying helicopters brough in apprehension teams, which included law enforcement officers and special operations forces, while dozens of other aircraft — from fighter jets and bombers to drones — cleared a path for them by striking Venezuela's air defenses.\n\nDan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters on Saturday that \"those in the air over Caracas last night were willing to give their lives for those on the ground and in the helicopters.\"\n\nAmerican forces stormed the compound under heavy fire. At some point during the operation, which began late Friday night and continued for several hours into Saturday morning, the troops were wounded. The US said everyone made it out though.\n\nDozens of Venezuelan and Cuban security personnel were killed during the US raid, according to the two militaries.",

    "title": "Greenlanders tell us Trump's talk of buying the island crossed a line",
    "description": "Many Greenlanders are interested in working with the US, but they all bristle at the idea of being bought or taken by force.",
    "fullText": "If Greenlanders weren't concerned by President Donald Trump's threats to annex the territory in his first term, many of them are now.\n\nIn the days since the United States' surprise raid into Venezuela, there's been a renewed focus on Trump's interest in the island, sparking fear among locals.\n\n\"I don't know what he's able to do. Most of me is trying to tell myself, 'Don't worry, everything's going to be fine,' but still I'm worried,\" Tupaarnaq Kreutzmann Kleist, a sheep farmer in South Greenland, told Business Insider's Sarah Andersen on Tuesday.\n\nCasper Frank Møller, CEO and cofounder of Greenland tourist company Raw Arctic, echoed Kleist's concerns, saying that he and many of his peers are worried about how the situation may affect their finances.\n\n\"We've made investments into developing our tourism aspects of our company, and it comes with risk now because of the geopolitical situation and the threats by Trump, so of course, yeah, we're all really worried,\" he told Business Insider on Tuesday.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider on Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Trump and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue Greenland, including \"utilizing the US Military.\"\n\nTrump's had his sights set on the Arctic island, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, since his first term in office. He has argued that Greenland's location makes it strategically important, as the melting of Arctic ice opens up new shipping routes and intensifies competition with Russia and China. The island is also rich in critical minerals and already hosts a key US military base, which American officials say is vital to missile defense and Arctic security.\n\nWhen Trump initially raised the topic of buying Greenland in 2019, Greenlandic influencer and engineer Qupanuk Olsen told Business Insider she and other locals thought it was a joke, and said she still didn't take it seriously when Trump resurfaced talks in late 2024.\n\nThat changed when Donald Trump Jr. visited Nuuk in January 2025. \"That's when we realized that Trump's words were no longer just words,\" Olsen said in June. \"They are real, and he means what he says.\" Business Insider wasn't able to reach Olsen this week for a follow-up.\n\nIn the wake of the raid on Venezuela, Møller said on Tuesday that Trump's threats to annex Greenland feel \"much more realistic that it will actually happen\" than when he spoke with Business Insider in January 2025.\n\nUS interest had at least one positive effect, Olsen said in June: It pushed Greenlanders to think more seriously about their place in the world and the need to speak for themselves.\n\n\"It was such a huge wake-up call for everyone in Greenland because suddenly we needed to have an opinion whether we still want to stay under Denmark, whether we should become independent, or whether we should become a state under the United States,\" she said. \"We certainly had options. So those options were helpful in the beginning for the independence movement.\"\n\nThat mindset may be shifting. Kleist said she's worried that \"we as the local indigenous Greenlandic people are slowly going against each other now,\" she told Business Insider on Tuesday. Some want to stand with America, others with Denmark, she said. Ultimately, though, the dream is for Greenland to become its own independent country, she added.\n\n\"We want Greenland to be the Greenlanders, and we're not for sale. We are not to be taken over,\" Møller said.\n\nNaaja Nathanielsen, Greenland's minister of natural resources, business, energy, justice, and gender equality, said in June that she sees much of the American administration's interest in Greenland as an opportunity for collaboration. But she said the way Trump is going about it is wrong.\n\n\"I think if we take the temperature down a bit and de-escalate the conflict level and the rhetoric, I think we can, in agreement with each other, find many paths forward that are mutually beneficial for both the US and for us,\" Nathanielsen said in June. \"But we don't appreciate being talked about as a commodity, as something you can buy or sell or acquire or take. That is, of course, offensive to all people.\"\n\nIn an email on Tuesday, Nathanielsen told Business Insider that she stands by what she said in June.\n\n\"The people of Greenland find the current situation unsettling, and it causes a great deal of anxiety,\" she wrote. \"We will continuously promote the idea of alliances and partnerships over colonialism. We have had our share of that.\"\n\nDenmark, Trump has argued, is not doing enough to safeguard Greenland. \"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security,\" Trump told a group of reporters on Air Force One on Sunday.\n\nThe same day, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen urged the US in a statement to \"stop the threats against a historically close ally.\" Frederiksen has previously rejected Trump's suggestions outright, telling him that Greenland is not for sale and that any idea of annexation is \"absurd.\"\n\nFrederiksen has warned that any US military action against Greenland would severely damage NATO unity, raising questions about whether the alliance could withstand such a conflict between allies.\n\nOn Tuesday, major European leaders, including those from France, Germany, the UK, Italy, Spain, Poland, and Denmark, released a joint statement defending Greenland. \"Greenland belongs to its people,\" the statement said. \"It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"",

    "title": "Larry Page is officially moving business out of California ahead of a proposed billionaire's tax",
    "description": "The Google cofounder has severed ties between California and several of his business entities, including his family office.",
    "fullText": "Billionaire Larry Page is peacing out of California.\n\nThe Google cofounder has cut ties between California and many of his assets that risked exposing him to a proposed new wealth tax in the state, meeting an end-of-2025 deadline, according to filings reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nPage's family office, Koop, was converted out of California in late December and incorporated in Delaware, per filings with both states. Page converted several other entities to Delaware, including Flu Lab LLC — a vehicle he has used to fund research on tackling influenza and lists its principal office address in Nevada — and another entity named One Aero, which has funded his flying car ventures and lists its principal office address in Florida.\n\nA filing was also made to convert Dynatomics, LLC from California to Delaware with a new principal address in Keller, Texas. Page launched Dynatomics, a new startup focused on applying AI to aircraft manufacturing, in 2023, Business Insider previously reported. A source close to Page said that the team, run by Chris Anderson, continues to work out of California.\n\nAnderson and representatives for Page's family office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe New York Times reported in December that Page had told people he was considering moving to Florida because of a proposed ballot measure that would tax the state's wealthiest residents. The proposal, if passed successfully, would mean that any California resident worth more than $1 billion would be taxed 5% of their assets.\n\nUnder California law, residency is determined by the nature of a person's ties to the state, with factors such as the time spent in the state and the maintenance of substantial business ties taken into account. If the ballot measure is approved in November, it would take effect retroactively for residents living in California as of January 1, 2026.\n\nA source close to Page said the Google cofounder had already left the state. Whether Page's move is temporary could not be learned.\n\nPage is ranked the second-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nBesides his family office and funding vehicles, Page converted out an LLC that Business Insider previously identified as being used to purchase islands in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, from California to Delaware, with a new address listed in Florida.\n\nA separate LLC Page used to purchase an Island in Fiji was also converted out to Delaware.\n\nPage's wife, the scientist Lucinda Southworth, founded a marine-conservation charity named Oceankind. Filings show that Oceankind converted out of California to Delaware in December.\n\nDelaware has become a popular state for businesses to incorporate due to its favorable tax structure, privacy, and its home to a court system specifically designed to handle corporate disputes. The state does not require LLCs to disclose the names and addresses of directors when incorporating, providing them with an extra layer of privacy.\n\nPrivacy is especially important to Page, whose family office is shrouded in a level of secrecy unparalleled by most and carefully managed by its CEO, Wayne Osborne.\n\nCristina Rosado, an attorney who handles many of Page and Southworth's assets, signed several of the California filings.\n\nPage incorporated three entities in Florida last year, as previously reported by The New York Times. A Koop LLC was incorporated in Florida in January 2025, per filings reviewed by Business Insider. It could not be confirmed if it belongs to Page.\n\nThe California billionaire tax proposal faced some opposition from leaders in venture capital and politics. In a post on X in December, venture capitalist Vinod Khosla said the proposed measure would mean California would lose its most important taxpayers and \"net off much worse.\"\n\n\"Long term damage unless legislature bans wealth taxes,\" he added. \"Easier to equalize taxes on work income and capital gains at the national level.\n\nMatt Mahan, Democratic mayor of San Jose, California, on Monday described the tax as \"a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy.\"\n\nWhite House AI czar David Sacks has criticized the proposal and said it will backfire. He has also said he believes Miami and Austin will overtake New York and San Francisco for finance and tech, respectively. He announced this month that his venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, had opened an office in Austin.\n\nLast month, celebrity lawyer Alex Spiro wrote a letter to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, warning that the proposed billionaire tax would \"trigger an exodus of capital and innovation from California,\" Business Insider previously reported.\n\nHave something to share?

    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

    "title": "The Space-Saving Tools and Tricks That Made My Tiny Kitchen Usable",
    "description": "It took creativity (and money), but now I can cook in my little kitchen.",
    "fullText": "Last year, one of my New Year's resolutions was to overhaul my apartment and turn it into a cleaner, more comfortable, more organized, and more efficient space. Knowing that a messy space can negatively impact your productivity and overall mental health, I reasoned that this would actually serve the purpose of making me a more efficient, peaceful person, so I took it seriously. One major issue was quickly apparent: My kitchen is tiny, which meant it was disorganized and more or less useless when it came to its primary function, which is to facilitate my cooking. It took some creativity (and money), but I figured out what to do—and now I'm learning to cook and bake better for one of this year's resolutions.\n\nMy kitchen is a little over three feet wide and five feet long. (I live in NYC, where this is the norm.) There is no counter space; all there is along one side is a sink and an oven. The first thing I had to do was manufacture counter space, which I did by adding cubed storage shelving. (I did this years ago, but only truly organized the cubes last year. We're getting to that.) It looks like this:\n\nThe main things I thought of, besides organizing the cubed storage, were how I could better utilize what space I did have, which is why anything and everything possible is now hanging vertically on under-cabinet wine glass racks, utensil holders, or a towel rack, plus hooks all over. What I'm most excited for is the impending delivery of this big peg board, which is going to allow me to hang more utensils and cookware on the wall.\n\nOther, smaller improvements became more obvious to me as I worked through organizing the big stuff. Once I cleared out and designated a suitable spot for my Nespresso, I figured out I needed a vertical, adhesive-backed holder for the pods, since there wasn't enough room in the cubes to hold them in their retail boxes. I finally bought a big ladder so I could actually use my cupboards. I then set about organizing the cupboards with acrylic risers, the same way I organized my perfume and makeup. For the area under the sink, I bought a pull-out shelf to give me easy access to cleaning materials. The boxes containing my various grains and oats were too unwieldy to keep in my cupboards, which led me to a rotating rice dispenser. It went on that way for a while, with me paying tribute to the Amazon gods every few days, but it was all because I had a bigger plan.\n\nYou may not want a giant peg board or need to hang all your spatulas upside-down. Maybe you have lots of drawers. That's cool. You still need a plan for organizing whatever you've got and a plan for figuring out what you, specifically, need.\n\nThroughout the organizing process, I kept a key principle in mind. It's called the Organizational Triangle and it's a set of three rules: Everything needs a place, similar items must be stored together, and for every new thing that comes in, one should go out. I ignored the last rule, for the most part, because what I was bringing in was meant to store what was already there better, but those first two were crucial. Prior to using the OT, not everything had a place. Some bowls and mugs lived in the sink. Not everything was stored together, either, which made it a pain to attempt to cook. By grouping similar items and designating each of them a spot, I could assess the volume of each category, get rid of what I didn't need, and better organize everything. By organizing smaller batches of things that would fit into one cube or on one hanging rack, I ended up organizing the whole thing, big-picture-style.\n\nOther cleaning and organizing techniques, like SIMPLE and Core 4, were also instrumental. Both of these advise that you need containers for your things. Again, this helps you assess actual volume and make sharper decluttering choices, but it also keeps everything neat. I got a little abstract in my interpretation, considering my hanging organizers \"containers,\" but also used boxes and the aforementioned grain dispenser to meet those requirements.",

    "description": "And you can already buy them.",
    "fullText": "Anker launched a pair of \"2-in-1\" earbuds under its Soundcore brand at CES 2026, and it has a unique feature: They can be worn in two ways by adjusting the ear hooks. When you want active noise cancellation, you can wear it in-ear, and when you don't, you can adjust the hooks for an open-ear design. This quirky product is called the Soundcore Aerofit 2 Pro—and you can already buy it for $150, which includes a launch discount of $30.\n\nWhen it comes to CES announcements, I'm always wary of vaporware, aka products that are announced but never shipped. That's why I keep an eye out for products with a shorter launch window so you can actually get your hands on the things you're excited about. The Soundcore Aerofit 2 Pro is one of those products. As Anker itself admits on the product page, the Aerofit 2 Pro isn't for everyone. The biggest quirk of this product is its size. It's a lot bigger than most ANC earbuds, and the ear hooks go all the way around your ears, which isn't a fit that works for everyone. The charging case is also quite large, when compared with other ANC earbuds: It's 4.23 inches (11cm) wide, and it supports wireless charging.\n\nMost noise-cancelling headphones let you switch to a listening mode that allows ambient sounds via software, but the Aerofit 2 Pro lets you do this by physically twisting the earbuds. This adjustment seems quite seamless based on the demo video on the product page, but I haven't tested it in-person, so I'll reserve my judgment until I do. There are five levels of adjustment for the ear hooks, with levels 1 and 2 reserved for open-ear listening, and 4 and 5 for noise cancellation. Level 3 maintains your previous listening mode to prevent accidentally switching to a different mode.",

    "title": "12 Shows Like 'Heated Rivalry' You Should Watch Next",
    "description": "The cottage has wi-fi now.",
    "fullText": "My Canadian in-laws include a famous (I'm told) ice hockey star, and yet I've still spent more time engaging with hockey via the HBO Max streaming sensation Heated Rivalry than from the stands of any actual court or rink or whatever it is you call the place where people pass around their pucks. Not that I know any more about the game after watching, because frankly, that's not why we're here, nor is that what the buzz is all about.\n\nHeated Rivalry is all about the very horny relationship between Japanese-Canadian team captain Shane (Hudson Williams) and Ilya (Connor Storrie), a headstrong Russian playing for a different team (not a euphemism). Even as their public relationship remains contentious over a period of years, the two develop a casual (at least at first) sexual relationship that grows increasingly sweaty and romantic, ice notwithstanding. Not to be outdone, the show also traces the complicated relationship between an American team captain and a smoothie barista.\n\nIn the increasingly backward-looking world of streamer programming, Heated Rivalry managed to draw eyes and a renewal by being the horniest, gayest show out there. Once you've binged it, you can follow up with one of these steamy streamalikes.\n\nIt's a short flight from horny gay ice hockey in Canada to horny gay figure skating in Japan and, yet, Yuri on Ice has just been sitting there waiting to be rediscovered. One of the best-reviewed anime of the last decade or so, the show finds defeated 23-year-old skater Yuri Katsuki returning to his hometown in Kyushu before an impromptu routine goes viral and draws the attention of Victor, a former champ who hopes to coach Yuki to revive his own career. The developing relationship is complex and compellingly twisty, and the animation is gorgeous; the show also gets a lot of credit for accuracy from both figure skaters...and pole dancers. Stream Yuri on Ice on Hulu and Crunchyroll.\n\nA standout of its year that, of course, got cancelled, the show expands on the 1992 film of the same name, diving further into the real-life story of the Rockford Peaches, women's professional baseball team in 1943. Abbi Jacobson, Chanté Adams, and D'Arcy Carden star as Carson, Max, and Greta, all three characters queer, either comfortably or in a process of exploration. Lest that sounds like some kind of ultra-woke revisionism, the show, while highly fictionalized, approaches the LGBTQ+ makeup of the Peaches far more accurately than did the earlier movie (despite including both Rosie O'Donnell and Madonna among its cast). Stream A League of Their Own on Prime Video.\n\nSex, desire, and queer longing in the high-pressure world of competitive sports? Sounds like a theme. This Spanish-language show involves young athletes at the Pirineos Center of High Performance (better them than me), battling to be the best in their respective sports and, with a bit of luck, earning sponsorship deals with the global fashion brand of the title. The central, steamy, but secretive relationship is between Roque Pérez (Agustín Della Corte) and Sebas Senghor (Juan Perale)—think Heated Rivalry, but in Spanish and with rugby. Stream Olympo on Netflix.\n\nLena Waithe created this comedy following Hattie, an aspiring screenwriter and queer Black woman navigating life and work in LA with her straight besties, Marie (Christina Elmore) and Nia (Gabrielle Graham). The tone is loose and funny, involving friends who spend as much time trash-talking as they do working, but there's still a sense of young people in a hyper-competitive industry fighting to make it. Stream Twenties on Paramount+ and BET+.\n\nTonally, this time-jumping survival drama is a total mismatch, but I'm throwing it in the mix for its blend of sports and queer characters, especially leads Taissa (Jasmin Savoy Brown) and Van (Liv Hewson). The show is about a group of teenage girls becoming stranded in the wilderness on the way to a soccer match in 1996 and doing terrible things to survive—the extent of which we only learn about via flashbacks from the present, where the events of those 19 months continue to have an impact. There are ambiguous teases of the supernatural, and plenty of horror unfolds in a past that we're still seeing fleshed out going into the fourth and final season. The show rather cynically posits that there's a huge difference between the version of the past we talk about and the one that really happened. Stream Yellowjackets on Paramount+ and Netflix (for the first two seasons).\n\nSteamy soap Young Royals follows Wilhelm (Edvin Ryding), the fictional prince of Sweden, as he embarks on a romance with another student, Simon Eriksson (Omar Rudberg), at their elite boarding school—it's not hockey, but there's no shortage of intense competition among these attractive young queers and their classmates. While possessed of all the addictive qualities of the teen drama genre, Young Royals takes itself a bit more seriously than some, and feels remarkably fresh in its commitment to casting age-appropriate actors in all the key roles. Stream Young Royals on Netflix.\n\nA fun comedy-drama set during the 1980s, GLOW’s ensemble is lead by Alison Brie as Ruth Wilder, a serious yet very out-of-work actor who signs on with Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling, a fictionalized version of the real sports organization of the same name. The show’s heightened drama, period detail, and willingness to be a little silly were highlights, as were the multiple queer characters: the growing relationship between Yolanda (Shakira Barrera) and Arthie (Sunita Mani) is a prominent focus; menwhile, Bash, the wrestling producer, explores his own sexuality amid the Reagan-era AIDS crisis. Stream GLOW on Netflix.\n\nLet's say that you're into Heated Rivalry for the hockey. Which: sure. To each their own. If so, you could do a lot worse than this (largely standalone) Letterkenny spin-off, starring and created by Jared Keeso, who also plays the title character. The veteran player moves to the small-ish city of Sudbury, Ontario after making a bet that he can save the struggling Sudbury Bulldogs. The comedy is simultaneously raunchy and sweet (think Ted Lasso), with some solid queer rep among some of the secondary characters. More to the point, perhaps, is the involvement of executive producer and frequent director Jacob Tierney, who just happens to have also created Heated Rivalry. Stream Shoresy on Hulu.\n\nComedian Benito Skinner plays himself, kinda, in this buzzy comedy that sees a former high school jock facing his freshman year in college while desperately trying to convince himself and everyone else that he's as straight as they come (relatable, except for the jock part). Much of the appeal is in its deft blending of tones: It's a frequently raunchy college comedy, and simultaneously a sweet coming-of-age story about accepting yourself without worrying about what everyone else thinks. The cast includes Adam DiMarco (The White Lotus) and Rish Shah (Ms. Marvel) and, just like Heated Rivalry, it's a streaming show with queer leads that's actually been renewed. Stream Overcompensating on Prime Video.\n\nAnother BL anime (as in \"Boy's Love,\" a significant sub-genre), Given follows four adults who come together to form the titular rock band, with music connecting the characters while also helping them to navigate past trauma. The manga on which the show is based interweaves several gay storylines, but the anime puts a focus on the growing relationship between Ritsuka and Mafuyu, whose guitarist boyfriend died by suicide. In common with Heated Rivalry, it's about navigating a complicated relationship in a high-pressure environment. Stream Given on Crunchyroll or buy it from Prime Video.\n\nThere were a few impressive LGBTQ+ shows this past season, with Boots generating buzz and predating both Pluribus and Heated Rivalry by just about a month. Alas, while those two survived the (more than) annual streaming purge, Boots didn't make it out of camp. Based on a memoir from Greg Cope White, the Netflix series stars Miles Heizer as Cameron Cope, a closeted gay teen who follows his bestie into the Army in the era before \"Don't ask, don't tell,\" and well before serving in the open was a possibility. Stream Boots on Netflix.\n\nThe affirming coming-of-age/queer teen love story that we all kinda need right about now, Heartstopper is more about kisses and significant glances than it is about the hot, illicit sex of Heated Rivalry—and do with that what you will. While it never soft-peddles the dangers of homophobia, it likewise doesn’t wallow in tragedy. Kit Connor and Joe Locke deliver sensitive (and often very funny) performances in a show that’s nearly all smiles without feeling treacly. Stream Heartstopper on Netflix.",

    "description": "Forget overpriced cleaner apps—Mole does it all for free.",
    "fullText": "There are a lot of apps on the market that claim to \"clean up\" your Mac—for a price. Some offer subscriptions, some cost a lot up front, but for the most part, they offer the same few features—wiping things like caches and logs, completely uninstalling apps, and monitoring system health. These apps all tend to be a little on the bloated side, with a lot of animations and graphics.\n\nThe free, open source, Terminal-based Mole is the opposite of those applications. Running entirely from the command line, Mole couldn't possibly look less flashy, but it combines a number of different tools that can free up hard drive space on your Mac while also keeping things running smoothly.\n\nTo get started, you'll need to install Mole. The simplest way to do this is by using Homebrew, which any Mac user interested in a Terminal-based application should probably do anyway. There is, alternatively, a script you can use to install Mole on the download page.\n\nTo use the application, just type \"mole\" in the Terminal and hit enter—you'll be presented with the five main tools offered: Clean, Uninstall, Optimize, Analyze, and Status. (You can, alternatively, type \"mole\" followed by the tool you want to use—more on that later.)\n\nThe first, Clean, scans your hard drive for caches and temporary files, then deletes them. The application explains what it's doing every step of the way, and you can always do a dry run using the command mole clean --dry-run if you'd like to see an overview before affecting any system files.\n\nThe second tool, Uninstall, presents you with a list of applications installed on your computer and lets you know how much storage space they're using. You can select as many applications as you want with the spacebar, then hit enter in order to completely remove them. This doesn't just uninstall the application itself—it also removes all associated files, including settings.\n\nThe third tool, Optimize, performs a number of routine maintenance tasks such as flushing the DNS cache, optimizing databases, and refreshing the Finder. I find this useful when my Mac is hanging for seemingly no reason.\n\nThe fourth tool, Analyze, lets you see which folders are taking up the most space on your hard drive—useful if you're trying to free up disk space on your Mac. You'll see a list of folders alongside how much space they're taking up. Open a folder to see a breakdown of the folders and files inside it. I was able to find a number of large files using this tool, some of which I didn't need anymore.\n\nThe final tool, Status, is a simple dashboard with stats including CPU, memory, and hard drive usage alongside an animated ascii-art cat. It's simple.\n\nIt's all very straight forward to use, and there are generally instructions on the screen telling you what to do next. One thing I do want to point out is that you can run most of these tools directly from the Terminal, without the initial menu. You can, for example, type mole clean to run the cleaner or mole status to open the dashboard. You can",

    "title": "CES 2026: I Tried a Gaming Headset That Can Read Your Mind",
    "description": "Lock in before you drop in.",
    "fullText": "Before this CES, I thought gaming headsets had gotten about as complex as they ever would. How many improvements can you possibly make on speakers and microphones? Well, forget all that. Apparently, the future of gaming headsets is mind reading.\n\nIn a private demo with a colleague from IGN, I tested out a collaboration between HP's HyperX gaming brand and brain-computer interface company Neurable. Neurable's been at CES before, but most of its work has been in the defense and enterprise sectors. The brand is specifically aimed at helping you nail down your focus, and now, Neurable thinks it can use that to help gamers.\n\nBefore trying on the Neurable x HyperX headset, I did a quick run-through in a target shooting game, where I shot down 30 targets with a 547ms response time. Then, I was guided through a focus program called Prime. This showed a cloud of dots on the screen, and I was told to do whatever I needed to do to focus up. I decided to stare into the distance and count, and in about 90 seconds, the dots had shrunken down into a small orb and I was \"primed.\" Neurable also suggested focusing techniques like repeating a word in your head over and over, or following one of the dots as it moved about the screen, but these didn't work for me.\n\nThen, I did the shooting test again. Theoretically, I should have been better, but I actually scored slightly worse this time—a 559ms response time. Still, that response time isn't terrible, and your mileage may vary. I might have already been locked in before priming. In contrast, my colleague actually reduced her response time by about 40ms after priming. If all of that optimization sounds really nitty-gritty, it is. This is aimed at esports players and streamers, where every millisecond counts.\n\nThat's probably where the headset's coolest feature comes in for me. Alongside Prime, Neurable and HyperX are also working on an overlay plugin for streamers that can show their focus levels on screen. You can display this as a speedometer, or as that cloud of dots, or even as a progress bar that shows whether you're \"on tilt\" or not. It should make for some pretty fun interactions with viewers, and play well with existing plug-ins, like eye trackers that show where a streamer is looking.\n\nPlus, my slightly worse response time after priming wasn't totally useless. Neurable said the headset could be used to help you \"practice choking,\" where you psych yourself up shortly after locking in and end up worse off. I thought that sounded like marketing spin, but my colleague, a high-level raider in World of Warcraft, said it would have real use for her.\n\nIt's still just a concept for now, but it's exciting to see this kind of tech getting ready to hit the mass market. What also sets Neurable apart is how portable it is. Unlike other brain-computer interfaces, this just looks like a normal headset, and all the contacts are just stored in the ear cups. There's no need for a giant helmet with discs and wires attached to it, thanks to Neurable's expertise in AI. The company says that using such a compact form factor does result in getting a small amount of data (and a lot of junk data, at that), but thanks to an on-device AI model, it's easily able to detect trends in your focus and translate them into something usable.\n\nThat seemed to be true in my demo, which at the end of the day, kind of felt like a guided meditation with real-time feedback. You could use this for more than gaming, but it's a clever use case for digital mind-reading, and the streaming plugins really take the cake, helping solidify the concept into a clear product with a concrete goal and target audience.\n\nIt'll take a while for the gaming version of Neurable's tech to be ready, although the company said it hopes to get it out this year. In the meantime, you can buy an ultra-luxury headset with Neurable's mind-reading built in, although it's currently on pre-order and will set you back $500. It also won't come with Prime or that streaming plugin, although because those are based in software, that could change in the future.",

    "title": "CES 2026: XREAL's New Gaming Glasses Put a Huge, Fast Gaming Monitor Right on Your Face",
    "description": "Asus and XREAL are working together to make the big screen better for gaming, and smaller than ever before.",
    "fullText": "I've been a fan of XREAL for a while, but outside of people who are really into AR, it's still a lesser-known company. Lifehacker has given XREAL's glasses stellar reviews before, but in the company's new collaboration with Asus, it's aiming to expand its market. The new ROG XREAL R1 AR glasses are the first XREAL glasses aimed specifically at gaming (though its other models aren't exactly bad for gaming), and they basically put the best gaming monitor you could ever want right in front of your face.\n\nYou wear these like a normal pair of sunglasses, and you get a massive 171-inch virtual TV floating in a black void right in front of you. It's an OLED, so there are crisp colors and high contrast, and the resolution is a respectable 1080p. Most importantly, the glasses max out at a 240Hz refresh rate, meaning they can display up to 240 frames per second.\n\nTaken all together, that's better than pretty much all of the full-size desktop monitors I have at home, but these are portable. They're barely heavier than my reading glasses, too, and you can set your virtual screen to either be anchored in one spot (meaning it won't follow your head) or stay in front of your eyes at all times. I prefer the former, since it shakes around less.\n\nI also didn't get any of the usual problems I have with AR or VR, like light bleed or fuzzy graphics. Aside from the black void, this really did feel like looking at a real-life screen. And you don't even have to use the full 171 inches, if you prefer something smaller.\n\nAside from the glasses, Asus is also shipping these with a dock, to help you better use them with your various devices. It has two HDMI ports and one DisplayPort connection, so you can have up to three devices ready to go at one time. It's probably the most realistic way to simulate gaming on a movie theater screen, and it's only set to improve down the line. Asus told me these glasses will eventually support XREAL's 2D-to-3D conversion tech, which just came out on the new XREAL 1S glasses and automatically converts any image to 3D. The effect uses AI to determine how to split the image between your eyes, but it was so convincing to me when I tried it with Mario Kart World that it felt like it was officially developed by Nintendo.\n\nAnd on that end, I have confirmation from XREAL that the ROG XREAL R1 glasses are compatible with the XREAL Neo mobile dock and battery pack. This is much more compact than the dock that comes with the headset, and, if you plug the glasses and the Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 into it at the same time, it will allow you to play your Nintendo console in AR. Even Asus' dock can't do that without another Switch dock acting as an intermediary first. Plus, this will charge whatever device you're playing at the same time.\n\nThe ROG XREAL R1 AR glasses will release later this year, although pricing isn't available quite yet. They're expected to release in the first half of this year.",

    "description": "If you're working your way through Stella Montis, Arc Raiders' first post-launch map, you may have the Snap and Salvage quest. This multi-step quest requires you to find multiple spots of interaction, as well as recover some specific pieces of loot. It can take some time to figure all of this out on your own, so we've put together a step-by-step process to get you through it.\nNote that each part of this quest can be completed across multiple runs, so there's no need to wrap it all up in a single raid. That being said, you'll need to extract with the Magnetron and Flow Controller items once you find them, so it's probably best to bring in an augment that has a safe pocket or two to ensure you don't accidentally lose these precious items if you find them during your raid.",

    "description": "Whether Hogwarts Legacy was another RPG in your backlog of games or your first foray into video games, there are plenty of games like it that you can play once you've rolled the credits on WB Games' magical open-world title. For Harry Potter fans, Hogwarts Legacy is one of the best RPGs on the market, and it's largely based on lore from the Wizarding World. So, while it's difficult to get that same exact experience if you're looking to be in the world of Harry Potter, you can find similar gameplay elements and deep lore-rich stories in other games.\nBelow, we'll be listing 17 games that feature some sort of similarity to Hogwarts Legacy. That similarity could come in the form of one specific gameplay feature or an all-encompassing experience that gives you the same thrills as you had when walking the halls of Hogwarts.",

For Harry Potter fans, Hogwarts Legacy is one of the best RPGs on the market, and it's largely based on lore from the Wizarding World. So, while it's difficult to get that same exact experience if you're looking to be in the world of Harry Potter, you can find similar gameplay elements and deep lore-rich stories in other games.\n\nBelow, we'll be listing 17 games that feature some sort of similarity to Hogwarts Legacy. That similarity could come in the form of one specific gameplay feature or an all-encompassing experience that gives you the same thrills as you had when walking the halls of Hogwarts. If you haven't had a chance to pick up Hogwarts Legacy yet, it is available on Nintendo Switch 2.\n\nHogwarts Legacy was embroiled in controversy due to transphobic remarks from Harry Potter author JK Rowling. Although she was not personally involved with its development, she stands to profit from its success. For more, read our in-depth article on how Rowling's comments have impacted the trans community.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was one of the more important RPGs ever made due to its revolutionary open world map and quest design, two core pillars of Hogwarts Legacy. While you can still play the original, Oblivion Remastered is a better product in almost every single way. The 2006 masterpiece has been completely remastered, featuring overhauled graphics, character models, dialogue, and mechanics. The core game is still intact, though, as you start your adventure on an epic quest to uncover the mystery of why your emperor was murdered.\n\nAlong the way, you'll encounter five distinct guilds, each with its own questlines, several sprawling cities teeming with life, and an open world that features dozens of unique locations. Also, if you're a fan of the magical combat in Hogwarts Legacy, Oblivion Remastered lets you become a full-blown mage who can use a variety of different magic attacks. It doesn't officially support them, but a collection of Oblivion Remastered mods have also begun to pop up that can further improve the experience.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nImmortals Fenyx Rising is an action-adventure game in the mold of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild that places a large emphasis on combat, but still has many qualities that appeal to Hogwarts Legacy fans. You'll get to explore the world right from the start of the game, and when you're not fighting enemies, you can solve a number of challenging puzzles that lead to rewards or other areas within the world. As for combat, you'll get to challenge mythological beasts such as Medusa as well as a plethora of other smaller enemies. The combat in Immortals Fenyx Rising is quite faster than in Hogwarts Legacy, but it's easy to pick up once you understand the controls.\n\nIf the lore and story were your favorite parts about Hogwarts Legacy, then why not hop over to another beloved pop culture franchise? Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is an original story in the Star Wars universe that takes place between the events of the prequel trilogy and the new trilogy movies. It's a sequel to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, but you don't need to play that game to understand what's happening in Survivor.\n\nThe game continues to follow protagonist Cal Kestis as he attempts to lead a rebellion against the Empire with a band of outlaws. Survivor sees you visit several planets that are somewhat open world and all have different enemies to face, puzzles to solve, and collectibles to find. As you progress, you'll unlock more attack types, including additional Force abilities and lightsaber forms. The combat in Survivor can be fairly difficult, especially against the late-game bosses, but you have plenty of tools at your disposal to take down enemies. For newer video game players, you can simply set the difficulty level to its lowest setting and take in one of the best Star Wars tales told in recent memory.\n\nLA Noire might not be the first game you think of when you think of Hogwarts Legacy. However, the two games have \n\nIf you enjoyed the outskirt areas of Hogwarts Legacy that extended beyond the castle grounds, then Ghost of Tsushima might be right up your alley. This open-world RPG is set in 13th-century Japan during the Mongol invasion and features extremely detailed and beautiful landscapes outside of the war-torn towns and fields. Ghost of Tsushima sees you play as a samurai who's trying to navigate the invasion and protect their island from the Mongols. When you're not actively doing story missions, you can explore a huge world filled with real-life locations that are still standing in Japan today. You'll come across your fair share of enemies while exploring, but the combat in Ghosts of Tsushima is beginner-friendly while still being difficult to master as you unlock more weapons and skills. A sequel, Ghost of Yotei, is on the way in 2025.\n\nThe Horizon series features perhaps the closest games to Hogwarts Legacy. The first game in the series is Horizon Zero Dawn, but you can also play its sequel, Horizon Forbidden West, for an equally thrilling adventure. We recommend playing Zero Dawn first, though, as there's so much lore you need to understand before you can fully appreciate Forbidden West.\n\nIn Horizon Zero Dawn, you play as Aloy, an orphan born in the midst of a post-apocalyptic period in an alternate version of the United States in the 31st century. In this version of the US, man-made machines have taken over the planet, and tribes of hunter-gatherers and warriors try to survive without antagonizing them. Throughout Zero Dawn, you'll uncover the origins of Aloy's story, which is deeply entangled with how this future came to be and what happened to the humans before the machines took over. It's an epic adventure with a huge open world, combat centered around a bow and arrow, and plenty of secrets to discover.\n\nThe Dragon Age franchise is one that Hogwarts Legacy fans should find enjoyable. They're RPGs with an emphasis on narrative elements and exploration through a large, open world. There's also plenty of magic at play, both in combat and with basic mechanics. In The Veilguard, you play as Rook, who's tasked with stopping a pair of corrupt gods who have escaped their imprisonment. At the beginning of the game, you'll be by yourself, but over time, you can recruit a number of companions to join your party and fight alongside you for the duration of the adventure. Magic, an open world, and a mysterious story all make Dragon Age: The Veilguard an enticing option for any Hogwarts fan. You also don't have to play any of the original Dragon Age games to understand the story, so feel free to hop right in regardless of your experience.\n\nSpeaking of a franchise with some deep lore, the Marvel universe is a natural stepping stone for any Hogwarts Legacy player to dive into. While some fantastic Marvel games have been released in the past several years, Spider-Man was the game that marked Marvel's revival in the video game industry. This is an original story for the webbed hero that follows Peter Parker trying to navigate a day job while also being a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. The story starts off relatively slow, but develops into a thriller with all sorts of twists and turns.\n\nThe setting for Marvel's Spider-Man is an open-world New York City, and swinging through its skyscrapers or Central Park is one of the best feelings you can experience in a video game. The swinging mechanics along with the Arkham-style combat are thoroughly crisp, leading you to feel like you really are Spider-Man.\n\nIf puzzles were one of your favorite parts of Hogwarts Legacy, but you still want some exploration, then look no further than The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Breath of the Wild is one of the most celebrated video games of all time, combining a staggeringly massive open world with fantastic puzzles that actually require you to use different parts of your console to solve. Some puzzles can simply be solved using the joysticks on your Switch, while others use the console's gyro controls and both Joy-Cons. The puzzles can be surprisingly difficult to get through, but they might not even be the hardest part of the game.\n\nInstead, the combat and gear degradation systems in Breath of the Wild will likely have you more challenged than the puzzles. Combat can be difficult if you run into a boss or enemy that outlevels you, but even easy fights have the potential to turn difficult if your favorite sword breaks from too much use. While all of this sounds overly challenging, Breath of the Wild allows you to play at your own pace, and players of all skill levels can pick it up and immediately enjoy what it has to offer. An enhanced Switch 2 Edition of Breath of the Wild and its excellent sequel, Tears of the Kingdom, are out now and boast some very nice upgrades.\n\nNow, your first thought when you see a game like Baldur's Gate 3 might be that you're not a fan of turn-based combat. After all, if you liked Hogwarts Legacy, going from fast-paced wand fights to slow, turn-based moves in every encounter could be jarring. However, if you can get past the shift to turn-based combat and really sink your teeth into Baldur's Gate 3, you'll discover why it's considered one of the best RPGs ever made.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 is an epic tale of your character, who can either be a preset character or completely your design, trying to stop an alien force from taking over an entire continent's minds. The game isn't necessarily open world, as it features distinct zones that are a part of the different story acts, but the zones themselves are very large. Within these zones, you'll be able to pick up new party members, who you can completely control, go on winding side quests that feel like their own mini-story, and explore the beautiful and dangerous landscapes that make up each one of the maps. Baldur's Gate 3 also features cross-play and is fully co-op, so you can partake in the adventure with a friend or two.\n\nThe Assassin's Creed franchise is somewhat divisive, as many fans seem to either love or hate the different styles of games in the series. If you were to pick one to play to scratch your Hogwarts Legacy itch, though, make it Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Set in 400 BC Greece, Odyssey sees you take control of either a male or female protagonist who comes from humble beginnings. However, over the course of the game, you'll take part in a war between Athens and Sparta, command a ship across high seas, and explore perhaps the biggest open-world map on this list. The story in Odyssey has a few different branches that all clash by the end of the 50-hour-plus campaign, and it's one of the most memorable in the Assassin's Creed franchise. Hogwarts Legacy fans should find the combat easy to pick up, and exploration on a much larger scale than they find in the Wizarding World.\n\nFable III is one of the few games on this list that's somewhat difficult to play in 2025. However, if you're subscribed to Game Pass, then you shouldn't have any trouble on Xbox or PC. Fable III is the most recent game in the Fable series, but the next entry, currently known simply as Fable, is coming sometime in 2026. The Fable series is widely beloved in the gaming community thanks to the charm of its characters and gameplay. Fable III specifically sees you embark on a quest to take down an unruly leader and manage the kingdom for the people of your country.\n\nWhile the story in Fable III isn't especially long, it does offer you a plethora of choices to make that drastically impact how the narrative plays out. During your adventure in the main story, you'll come across a slew of combat engagements, which play out in real time and feature melee, ranged, and magic attacks. The combat can be a little clunky in Fable III, but the world and characters will keep you enthralled throughout the entire game.\n\nIf we're recommending games like Hogwarts Legacy, let's go with one of the only other Wizarding World titles on the market that's easily playable in 2025. Lego Harry Potter: Years 1-4 allows you to play through the first four years of the Harry Potter series as Harry himself. You'll get to explore a slimmed-down version of Hogwarts Castle and meet the cast of characters that you know and love. The game doesn't play out exactly like the movies or books, so there will be some different events that take place. Of course, you'll still get to partake in the classic Harry Potter events, such as playing Quidditch, sneaking around after dark, and even battling the Basilisk. Given the Lego nature of these games, they're meant to appeal to a more casual gaming audience, but any Harry Potter fan should find something to enjoy in Years 1-4.\n\nLife is Strange is strictly a game for Hogwarts Legacy players who value the story above anything else. Life is Strange doesn't feature any sort of combat or an open-world map to explore. Instead, the game takes place over a series of episodes that follow Max Caulfield, a high school senior who discovers that she can rewind time. Using this ability, Max tries to save her best friend, but altering the past can come with severe consequences. Your job is to find a way to navigate the pitfalls of time travel to try and get as happy an ending as possible. The story is gripping throughout every episode of Life is Strange, and there is some puzzle-solving along the way.\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the most well-reviewed games ever and easily a top 10 RPG of all time. If the lore and world of Hogwarts Legacy are something that appeals to you, there's arguably no better game to turn to than The Witcher 3. Don't be intimidated by the \"3\" in the title, as it helps to know the lore of the first two games, but it's not imperative whatsoever.\n\nThe Witcher 3 sees you take control of Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter who possesses unnatural abilities and strengths. Geralt begins the game on the hunt for his adopted daughter, Ciri, as he's having dreams of an undead army called \"The Wild Hunt\" coming for him and Ciri. While this is the premise of the game, The Witcher 3 is so much more than its initial plotline. The game takes you across an incredibly detailed and large open world where quests and new locations are waiting around every corner. The Witcher 3 even features its own card-based minigame, Gwent, which is now a full-fledged game in its own right.\n\nThe Tomb Raider reboot in 2013 kicked off one of the best gaming trilogies of the modern era. Consisting of Tomb Raider, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider, these games are extremely well-done and provide you with a very similar experience to that of Hogwarts Legacy. You play as Lara Croft, a world explorer who comes from a wealthy family but finds herself constantly embroiled in some controversies with rival explorers. The Tomb Raider games offer fast-paced and stealthy combat, where you can use a variety of weapons, but you'll also be tasked with solving puzzles, or \"tombs,\" as you progress through the story. With a solid mix of combat, storytelling, and puzzles, you should find yourself right at home as a Hogwarts Legacy fan.\n\nIf you want to step into another established franchise with a cast of iconic characters and villains, then look no further than the Batman Arkham trilogy. Consisting of Batman Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight, these games revolutionized an entire generation of action-adventure and RPG titles with their \"Arkham-style\" combat. Naturally, you play as Batman in these games, and each title offers a new story for the Caped Crusader. The stories often revolve around the villains of the game, and the second and third titles allow you to explore an open-world Gotham City. While there's crime around every corner in Gotham, there are also puzzles you can solve that are doled out by none other than The Riddler. There's a slice of gameplay for all Hogwarts Legacy fans, but the Arkham games lean more on the side of combat than puzzles.",

    "description": ": Workers face new mental health pressures as they shift from doing tasks to babysitting agentic AI",
    "fullText": "A report on occupational health warns that AI adoption may paradoxically increase workplace burdens rather than reduce them. As AI automates routine tasks, workers will shoulder new responsibilities: overseeing AI systems, catching their errors, and managing the resulting complexity – potentially triggering mental health pressures.\n\nResearchers from Imperial College London and Microsoft argue the real impact won't be mass job replacement, but a fundamental shift in work demands. Human roles will evolve from performing tasks to stewarding AI agents across workflows, including briefing them, reviewing outputs, and correcting errors.\n\n\"As AI absorbs routine tasks, human roles may shift toward stewardship, problem-solving, or emotional labor, all with their own psychological demands,\" said Dr Lara Shemtob, who led the research published in the Society of Occupational Medicine's (SOM) journal Occupational Medicine.\n\nThis effectively transforms workers into managers of AI systems – a role not everyone is suited for. The report warns AI may \"paradoxically increase the knowledge worker's burden of handling complex tasks while simultaneously exerting downward pressure on compensation.\" This means more responsibility and less pay, because AI supposedly makes work \"easier.\"\n\nAll of this could introduce novel occupational hazards, some familiar in form but different in scale and complexity, raising stress levels.\n\nEvidence already supports this concern. A 2024 study found AI coding tools actually slowed developers down due to time spent checking and correcting AI-generated errors. As AI systems become more autonomous, problems like \"hallucinations\" (false or inaccurate outputs) may escalate and become harder to detect.\n\nUntil now, much of the debate over AI has centred on the extent to which it will (or maybe won't) replace people's jobs.\n\nThe report urges quantifying AI supervision demands and building them into job descriptions to avoid hidden workloads that negate automation benefits.\n\nResearchers don't yet know the exact impact on human employees from having to work more closely with AI, the report concludes, but they say occupational health should be part of the dialog and analysis of how AI changes expectations of workers.\n\nWhether this scenario materializes remains uncertain. Recent reports show companies have invested tens of billions in generative AI with little return, and many projects fail due to underestimated deployment complexity.\n\nThe question isn't just how AI will change work, it's whether widespread adoption will happen at all. ®",

This community has taken it upon themselves to create thousands of mods for Ark, and some of these improve the game in ways that fans would have never expected. From adding entirely new maps to creating more dangerous and unique dinosaurs to making your life easier with quality-of-life changes, the best Ark mods can fundamentally alter how you play the game.\n\nDown below, you’ll find the top mods that Ark has to offer. These are all searchable and downloadable via the game's Steam Workshop section. The modding community for Ark began on Steam and never migrated over to Nexus Mods, which is a shift from how many other survival games handle mods. However, with the mods being directly on Steam, this should make it simpler for you to download your favorite mods and immediately boot them up in Ark.\n\nStructures Plus is a gigantic mod that's completely centered around building in Ark. A bulk of the mod focuses on quality of life fixes and changes for building mode to make your life much easier. However, the best part about Structures Plus is the ability to snap your structures into place, so there's no more guessing where they might fit. You'll also see new materials included with the mod to spice up base life and give you more objects to build and play around with.\n\nOne of the more tedious aspects of Ark is having to travel everywhere. While you do get access to dinosaurs, both on the ground and in the air, being able to quickly travel somewhere is a benefit many Ark players wish they had. Well, it's no longer a wish with the Awesome Teleporters mod. This mod adds three new items into the game, and one of them is a teleporter that you can place anywhere on the map in whatever quantity you want. You can then quickly teleport to the locations you've placed them at. The mod also adds another teleport that transports you to a public teleporter on the map and a Dino Tracker, which allows you to teleport directly to a dino you're currently tracking.\n\nThere are very few worse things than dying in Ark, as you usually tend to lose whatever you had in your inventory. However, with the Death Recovery Mod, that won't happen ever again. The mod adds a personal gravestone to a set location of your choosing. If you die, you can return to this gravestone to retrieve any items that you lost upon death. You can basically place this gravestone down near your bed or respawn point so that when you die, you'll immediately be able to get your items and go on like nothing happened.\n\nWhile capturing all sorts of different dinosaurs and seeing them roam out in the wilderness is one of the best parts about Ark, it can also make dinosaur management a real hassle. Fortunately, with the Dino Storage v2 mod, you can safely and quickly store your captured dinosaurs in a safe place. This mod is basically like the PC system in Pokémon or a personal chest in Minecraft. Once you capture a dinosaur, you can choose to store it in the Dino Storage box until you're ready to take it back out. This allows you to easily track the dinosaurs you've caught and saves a ton of space on your part of the island in Ark.\n\nThe Upgrade Station mod allows you to fully improve the quality of any item in Ark. You can upgrade your gear, weapons, and tools from their most basic form all the way to the highest level possible (Ascendant). You can even upgrade the TEK armor set and items that have been modded into Ark. This means both your vanilla and modded weapons and armor can be upgraded using the new Upgrade Station that you can easily place at your base. You're even able to quickly salvage items at the station, giving you more resources to upgrade your gear.\n\nA tedious, but necessary, part of the progression in Ark is dealing with Engrams. You need them to access more advanced content throughout the game, but working through the system can be overwhelming and time-consuming. Luckily, the Auto Engrams mod aims to make the system more automatic and less taxing on the player. The mod automatically unlocks Engrams every time you level up and ignores the point restrictions on Engrams. This means you'll be able to take advantage of new Engrams without having to manually unlock them yourself.\n\nHunting normal dinosaurs is always an adrenaline rush in Ark, but what if there were a way to up the ante? The Improved Dinos mod adds rarer dinos into the game and gives them the ability to roam across a vast area, so there's some legwork when it comes to hunting them. If you manage to kill one of these rare dinosaurs, you're guaranteed to receive some rare blueprints that otherwise would have taken you hours to get from hunting other dinos across the island. The mod adds three dinos, with each one having unique traits: Raptor Elite, Alpha Dilo, and Obsidian Carno. You can read about their traits on the mod's Steam Workshop page.\n\nPrimal Fears is one of the biggest mods to come to Ark, and it adds hours of specifically-designed PvE content to the game. The mod adds different tameable tiers for every dinosaur in the game, as well as boss dinos that are incredibly difficult to kill. Each tameable tier of a dinosaur makes it more challenging to capture, and the tiers come with different challenges you'll have to overcome. In addition to all of that, Primal Fears also places brand new items into the game that aid players in capturing or killing the new dinosaurs. You can see more about the new dinos and items on the mod's Workshop page.\n\nThe normal SpyGlass in Ark certainly has its uses, but the Awesome SpyGlass mod makes it seem irrelevant. This mod turns your vanilla SpyGlass into a beacon of information, allowing you to point it at anything and receive a slew of details about whatever you're targeting. This includes dinos, eggs, supply crates, and just about anything else you can find on your island. You can also customize the SpyGlass with a variety of options that are available right from the mod's menu in-game.\n\nIf you've played Pokémon or even Palworld, then you probably know about the Shiny forms of creatures in those games. Well, the Shiny! Dinos mod brings that mechanic to Ark, giving you extremely rare and differently-colored dinos to track and tame. Dinos with different colors possess special abilities that you can harness if they're tamed, but they can also be killed to receive some unique rewards. These Shiny dinos have the chance to be a beefed-up version of themselves as well, so don't be surprised if you run into an Aberrant or X variant.\n\nThe taming system in the vanilla version of Ark is certainly in-depth, but it can get old after a while. We do have some mods on this list that help improve the taming system, but none are as advanced as the Immersive Taming mod. This mod adds a slew of new taming methods to the game, including giving certain dinos new food, protecting the dino, attacking a dino's target, caring for them, and more. There's also a trust meter with each dino you tame, allowing you to build real bonds with the dinos you capture. This also plays a factor in how hostile dinos act towards you, so the mod really changes up your gameplay when it comes to dino interactions.\n\nVanilla Ark features a degradable gear system that forces you to constantly replenish certain tools and weapons in your inventory after they've been used enough. While this adds to the difficulty of Ark, sometimes you just don't want to worry about an item degrading. Fortunately, the Reusable Plus mod does exactly that, making it so a number of items no longer degrade after they've been created. This includes the grappling hook, spear, parachute, flare gun, and bola.\n\nIf you're playing Ark just for the vibes, the dinos, and the exploration, then you might want a way to make your day-to-day life a little easier. The Simpler Spawners mod aims to give you that easier life. The mod makes it so you can immediately spawn in any creature, resource, nest, or crate wherever you want. While some of the spawns do require you to exchange something else, you can pretty much spawn in whatever you want at any time. This allows you to fully customize your base as well as the entire map. Create a new biome, diversify other areas, and expand your base to be as big as your imagination allows for.\n\nMap mods have become extremely popular in the Ark community over the years. Perhaps the most infamous map mod of them all is the Dome of Death, which spawns you in on a terrifyingly difficult map. The Dome of Death is a small island map that locks you in with some of the most dangerous creatures Ark has to offer. Your goal in the dome is to find valuables that are scattered around the map, but there are creatures guarding them with their lives. You can't enter the dome with any tamed creatures by your side, so it's just you against nature.\n\nThe Auto Torch mod is all about adding some automation to your Ark life. The mod allows you to place timers on all light sources in the game and makes it so they no longer require any fuel. Basically, you're adding the ability to turn lights on and off whenever you want without having to manually go to each light source every day. You can also add some unique colors to the light sources by adding specific resources to them.\n\nDespite the name of this mod, it doesn't actually add any sort of bird creatures into Ark. Instead, what it does is optimize a variety of the game's elements and adds a slew of new creatures for you to kill, capture, or tame. The mod mostly accomplishes this by combining two other very popular mods, the Saurophaganax Mod and the Giant Spino Mod.\n\nWeapons are never in short supply when you're playing Ark, but the Primal Blades mod adds in three highly unique katanas that you can add to your inventory. The mod also adds extra dinos to the game, which drop the special crafting resources you need to create the three individual katanas. However, before the resources drop, you'll have to defeat waves of dinos, so there's much more depth to this mod than simply adding in a few new weapons that you can use.",

    "fullText": "on January 6, 2026 at 11:50AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nFallout 4 continues to be a well-regarded and popular RPG in 2026, but there are plenty of games like it that offer a similar experience or combine some of its best elements. At its core, Fallout 4 is an RPG with that classic Bethesda feel to it. However, it's also a game with several layers that have been separated and expanded upon in other titles.\n\nSo whether it's the RPG systems, world design, gunplay, or base-building of Fallout 4 that you enjoy, there's a game out there for you to play after you roll credits. Below you'll find the best games that are most like Fallout 4 in one way or the other. If you're more interested in RPGs as a whole, you can check out our list of the best RPGs to play in 2025, or refresh your Fallout experience with the best Fallout 4 mods.\n\nIf you're looking for a game similar to Fallout 4, why not play the RPG by the same developer that preceded it by three years? Skyrim is one of the best-selling RPGs of all time and features plenty of the same gameplay elements and mechanics as the Fallout franchise does. You're given a massive map to explore right from the start, there are several factions to join and complete quests for, and the story can take several twists and turns depending on your choices. Skyrim might be a fantasy game without any guns or grenades, but it still has that classic Bethesda RPG feel to it that's so prevalent in Fallout 4.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nWhile Fallout 4 isn't necessarily considered a scary game, there are some parts that can make you jump in your seat a smidge. If you're looking for more of that feeling, then Metro Exodus is the next post-apocalyptic world you want to dive into. Metro Exodus is a first-person shooter that's set in 2023's Russia after a series of devastating nuclear attacks all across the planet. You play as Artyom, a survivor who's trying to establish contact with other survivors, while also trying not to get killed by the newly formed creatures and harsh environment of the Russian wilderness. Metro Exodus features large, open zones, a story that spans one year through different events, and superb, realistic gunplay. The game can be seen as more of a survival/horror experience, but it still has the FPS and open-world elements that all Fallout fans know and love.\n\nAtomfall is a game that takes clear inspiration from the Fallout franchise. It's a first-person shooter set in a post-apocalyptic world where certain technologies have advanced far beyond what we have today. While the start of the game feels like Fallout, as you continue to play through Atomfall, it becomes clear that it has put several different spins on the experience.\n\nFor starters, Atomfall is a survival game that forces you to manage your hunger, thirst, stamina, and health at all times across a map with several large, open zones. Where Atomfall really shines is in its quest design and storytelling. The game offers you several different quest lines to reach the end credits, and you need to decide which quests to complete to achieve the ending that you think is the best.\n\nWe have another Bethesda RPG, and this time it's the game that Bethesda director Todd Howard referred to as \"Fallout in space.\" Starfield captures that Bethesda Fallout feeling across nearly all facets of the game. There's smooth gunplay, booming and interactive cities, several factions that offer complete questlines, and a story that forces you to explore all across a galaxy of planets.\n\nStarfield also offers you the ability to build a base on any planet you want, which is one of the best parts about Fallout 4. In addition to the base building, Starfield also lets you customize your own spaceship. You can deck out your craft with all sorts of different parts that offer pros and cons for exploration, combat, and aesthetics.\n\nIf Starfield is referred to as \"Skyrim, but in space,\" then The Outer Worlds franchise could be referred to as \"Fallout 4, but in space.\" The Outer Worlds isn't developed by Bethesda, but it is developed by Obsidian Entertainment, the studio behind Fallout: New Vegas. In late 2025, we got The Outer Worlds 2, a sequel to the original game that built a terrific world in a faraway and futuristic galaxy. The Outer Worlds 2 builds on its predecessor while keeping the charm of its characters, rewarding loot system, and fantastic map design. The game allows you to take command of a spaceship, recruit a cast of misfits, and make choices that impact the story and world around you as you solve a conspiracy that will have ramifications on the entire galaxy.\n\nMad Max is arguably one of the most underrated games of the last decade. It features an original story set in the post-apocalyptic world of the film franchise, and, as you might expect, places a large emphasis on vehicles and trying to survive the arid climate of the wasteland. You play as Max, who starts the game barely coming out alive after a conflict with the primary antagonist, Scabrous Scrotus. Scrotus takes Max's prized vehicle, the Magnum Opus, and you spend the entire game trying to retrieve the car from his clutches.\n\nMad Max features a huge open world that you'll traverse with different vehicles you acquire throughout your adventure. You can take down enemy camps, run dangerous quests for different characters, and participate in Death Run races to earn special rewards.\n\nDying Light 2 Stay Human is a game that can be seen as one of the closest experiences to Fallout 4 on this list. Of course, that's if Fallout 4 had parkour, slick movement abilities, and zombies instead of ghouls. The main gameplay element that Dying Light 2 focuses on is its parkour, which affects map traversal in almost every single way. You have access to a huge, post-apocalyptic city, and the entire map is set up for parkour moves and abilities. You also need these parkour elements to escape the hundreds of ravenous zombies that only come out during Dying Light 2's frightening nights.\n\nFallout 4 is set in a post-apocalyptic version of Boston, where nuclear war has ravaged the landscape. While Cyberpunk 2077 doesn't feature a post-apocalyptic world, it does feature an alternate version of San Diego that's set 50 years in the future.\n\nWhile the setting of Cyberpunk 2077 is certainly fascinating, it's the backdrop to one of the best RPG experiences on the market. Cyberpunk 2077 offers a highly interactive and content-filled open world that's dazzling to look at, regardless of where you are. The game offers you multiple ways to engage in combat, and you can enhance your preferred playstyle with unlockable skills and craft technological mods to upgrade your character.\n\nThe Last of Us only shares one or two aspects with Fallout 4, but it's still a game that's absolutely worth playing. It begins with a zombie-style outbreak and fast-forwards several years to a post-apocalyptic future. While The Last of Us uses a third-person perspective and features linear gameplay, it also tells one of the most gripping tales in video game history, which has since been turned into a major TV series on HBO. It might not be an open-world RPG like Fallout 4, but the world and story are all the reasons you need to pick it up.\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn takes the post-apocalypse theme and turns it upside down, as the game takes place more than 1,000 years into the future. During this 1,000-year period, man-made machines have taken over the planet after their AI went rogue during humanity's peak in the 21st century. Horizon Zero Dawn offers a huge open world to explore, hours and hours of lore to listen to and read, and engaging combat that mixes in archery, traps, and melee weapons. If you enjoyed Fallout 4 for the design of the Commonwealth or the mystery behind the story, Horizon Zero Dawn is a perfect game to play next.\n\nThe Division 2 is an online tactical shooter that takes place in the war-torn downtown district of Washington, D.C. after a viral outbreak has brought the nation to its knees. Your objective in The Division 2 is to fend off enemy factions trying to take control of the city. To do that, you and a group of real players need to work together to scavenge loot and supplies across an open map that's split up into zones. You can encounter both AI enemies and other players, but some areas are solely designated for PvP fights. The Division 2 features some elements of an RPG, but it's a multiplayer game at its core that requires you to improve your skills and gear, unless you want an enemy team to bulldoze through you.\n\nBioShock might be one of the older titles on this list, but few games can match the overall immersion that it brings to the table. It's set in the underwater city of Rapture, which was created by a man named Andrew Ryan to escape the ever-changing world above the surface. Through the course of the game, you'll explore every inch of the now-ruined city. Along your way, you can attain new powers and abilities, discover secrets about Rapture and its downfall, and fight off some of the most iconic enemies in video game history. BioShock might not have the freedom of Fallout 4, but it has the exact kind of vibe that you want as a fan of the game.\n\nWe're back with another RPG from Obsidian Entertainment. This time it's the studio's most recent entry, Avowed, which is set in a fictional fantasy land that's engulfed in conflict and intrigue. Avowed features four different large open zones that are almost big enough to be their own open world maps. These zones hold dozens of quests to complete, collectibles to find, and hidden locations that could alter how the story plays out if you find them early enough. Perhaps the best part of Avowed is its combat system and skills menu, which allow you to fight enemies using smooth gunplay, crisp melee weapons, or long-range magic spells or guns. It's a fantastic game from top to bottom that feels like a blend of both Fallout and Skyrim.\n\nWhile you might not initially think Borderlands is a lot like Fallout, the franchise has come a long way in the RPG genre. Borderlands 4, the most recent installment, features a large open world that you can explore as you progress the story. Unlike previous games, there are no loading zones between separate maps, so the entire thing is seamless. You also get to interact with a variety of characters, some of whom act as companions, and take on a plethora of side quests and other objectives throughout the world. The looting aspect of Borderlands 4 is different from Fallout, and the gameplay is much faster-paced, but both are terrific RPGs with large worlds to uncover.\n\nProject Zomboid is a survival sandbox game that's unlike many of the single-player experiences included on this list. What might make Project Zomboid enjoyable for a Fallout 4 fan is the open-world exploration and expansive base building elements. The game forces you to deal with swarms of zombies all across the open map, and to fend them off, you need to scrounge for resources that you can use to craft weapons, gear, and other items at your base. While the base-building in Project Zomboid is quite different from Fallout 4, you can make immensely large bases that allow you to sustain yourself in the post-apocalypse.\n\nIf the exploration and story are your favorite parts of Fallout 4, then Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden is a great addition to your game library. The game is set in a post-human version of Earth where different creatures have risen up to dominate the planet. You control a party of these creatures and can explore a slew of unique environments that all present different challenges. At the heart of Mutant Year Zero is turn-based combat, which is akin to something like XCOM. The combat might throw off FPS fans at first, but after you get used to it, you'll be engaged and start strategizing various ways to win fights by controlling your entire party of mutants.\n\nThe Warhammer 40000 franchise is known for its narrative-driven gameplay and engaging RPGs. Rogue Trader is another RPG that centers around turn-based combat and assembling a party of different characters for you to control. You can recruit a plethora of characters to join you, and each of them have various attacking styles, weapons, and abilities. When you're not in combat, you can explore a large world where the story plays a major role in everything you do. The choices you make throughout the story affect what happens later in the game and your eventual ending. It's an excellent RPG that blends the exploration and narrative parts of Fallout 4 with strategic, turn-based combat.\n\nWe've already mentioned The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, but pound for pound, its predecessor, Oblivion, might be the better overall RPG. While you can still go back and play the original, Bethesda released a fully remastered version of Oblivion at the start of 2025. The remaster is done wonderfully, as bugs have been fixed, graphics have been improved, and quality-of-life updates are live, including the ability to sprint. At its core, though, Oblivion Remastered is the same premier RPG that showcases Bethesda at its best in terms of gameplay design and world-building.",

    "fullText": "and \n Joey Carr\n on January 6, 2026 at 11:58AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nSometimes, it's nice to sit down on a quiet day and figure out a puzzle. Crosswords, jumbles, and other word-based puzzle games have appeared in newspapers for dozens of years, and the evolution of that premise--the puzzle video game--has created the same sort of brain-teasing brilliance on our TV screens.\n\nBelow are some of the best puzzle games available today: 22 games that challenge your critical-thinking skills in ways other games simply cannot manage. Some of these are newer games--including one indie darling that's recently taken the world by storm--while others have been around for quite a long time. Puzzle games offer some of the most engaging gameplay experiences in video games, and these 22 currently sit at the top of the puzzler pile.\n\nFor the best of the best in other genres, check out our rundowns of the best RPGs, best open-world games, and best racing games currently available.\n\nThe most recent puzzle game on this list has become the apple of the entire gaming industry's eye since it launched in April. Blue Prince follows a teenage boy named Simon as he tries to find a hidden 46th room in a mansion with 45 rooms--but no two visits are the same. Simon must \"draft\" a room with different properties, items, and configurations in order to reach Room 46 and complete his task, but doing so is no small task … and for every question you answer along the way, two more are asked in its place. Oh, and when you do reach Room 46 and the credits roll, well, that's when the game actually begins.\n\nIf you dig the game, be sure to check our some other great games like Blue Prince.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nThe Outer Wilds is an intriguing experiment of a game, with time serving as the central conceit--how much can you explore in only 22 real-world minutes? The unnamed spacefarer starts in the same location during each run, and after 22 minutes--or if the spacefarer should die--the cycle repeats itself. In that limited time--and across multiple runs, you'll gather clues, make discoveries, and solve the mystery of the Nomai, an extinct race that built the space stations hovering overhead. The Outer Wilds is a truly unique experience, and one with a fascinating puzzle to solve at its core.\n\nA merchant ship, lost at sea for five years, suddenly appears off the English coast, but with none of its crew aboard. As an investigator for the East India Company, it's your job to find out what happened to the crew and the Obra Dinn itself through the Memento Mortem, a pocketwatch-like item that can recreate the moment of someone's death. With it, you must solve the massive puzzle in front of you, while determining the interconnected fates of all 60 known crew members. Return of the Obra Dinn is a remarkable game, with a distinct low-resolution graphical style and a few \"a ha!\" moments that other games simply cannot replicate.\n\nTetris's classic line-clearing gameplay has been delighting players for decades now, but there's something about the way Enhance's take on the puzzler with Tetris Effect completely enhances the experience, especially in VR. Ethereal wisps flying across the screen, lights pulsing to the beat of the incredible soundtrack, and flashes of brilliant light at key moments make Tetris Effect--and its expansion, Connected--one of the best ways to play Tetris available today.\n\nIn The Talos Principle, an android solves a series of puzzles and becomes the progenitor of a new robotic civilization, after the death of humanity from global warming. Talos Principle 2 continues that story, but adds on a layer of political intrigue and tension that drives you to solve the puzzles even more. Croteam has devised some of the most thought-provoking challenges on this list, and the reward for solving them is a story rooted in real-world issues despite being told through the eyes of robots.\n\nBaba Is You is a puzzle game where you push blocks, but the blocks are words that represent certain actions. It's also a game that plays by its own rules--specifically, it allows you to change the rules as you progress, solving puzzles through the new rules you create. By shifting the words around the stage, you can fundamentally change how the world works around you, which creates some truly baffling challenges that stay with you long after you've completed them. This one has flown under the radar for most players, but those that have played Baba Is You cannot say enough about it.\n\nImagine finding an old photo book and holding one of the photos inside to your eye level, only to find that the image has somehow superimposed itself on the real-world and you can walk into it to explore. That's Viewfinder at its core, and puzzles are solved by strategically placing photos in this manner all over the world to create paths and access teleporters that take you to the next stage. It's a novel approach to the puzzle genre, as each picture warps the world in cool and interesting ways that it's always surprising to see how things turn out.\n\nRemaking one of the best puzzle games in the world is no small task, but Cyan did an incredible job bringing Riven--the sequel to the massively influential PC puzzler Myst--into the modern age with the 2023 remake. Riven is a sprawling adventure in the mystical world of D'Ni, where an ancient race hides its secret behind massive, mind-bending puzzles. Nothing about what made Riven so magical in the first place--from the unique puzzles to the always-foreboding atmosphere--is lost in translation through Riven's modernization, and the result is the new best way to relive this absolute classic.\n\nSpeaking of Myst, The Witness plays a lot like the early-'90s classic--you're thrown into a mysterious island, filled with puzzles littering the entire landscape, and the more progress you make, the more you learn about the world around you. This is also one for the completionists; though it's not required to finish the game's story, there are 650 puzzles scattered around The Witness's world. See if you can solve them all.\n\nBotany Manor might be the most \"zen\" game on this list, as its go-at-your-own-pace structure and relaxing vibes make it a great way to find some calm at the end of the day. The point-and-click game tasks you with growing magical flowers, called Forgotten Flora, and you must find clues on how to do so, as well as the items needed, scattered throughout the manor. Once you have the parameters for each plant, you must create the correct environment in the greenhouse, and then you'll have your Forgotten Flora. If you want to cozy up on the couch with a low-stakes game, Botany Manor fits the bill.\n\nThe original Portal bent your mind into a pretzel with its first-person, physics-based, portal-powered puzzle solving fueled by the sarcastic and sadistic AI GlaDOS, all within a tidy package that could be wrapped up in a few hours. Portal 2 ups the ante with a much longer campaign, as it also adds lasers, tractor beams, colored paints with different properties, and a new AI named Wheatley with a devious side of his own. Portal 2 is simply a classic, and a game that everyone should try for themselves at least once.\n\nA lot of the puzzle games we've seen so far use environmental aspects to challenge your mind, but none of them are centered around translating fictional languages, writing systems, and other word-based mechanics in order to more fully understand the world around them. Chants of Sennaar does this incredibly well, all while telling a tale about language barriers and their ability to separate the world around us. Chants of Sennaar was a big surprise hit when it launched in 2023, and you'll understand why the first time you boot up the game--no words required.\n\nThat The Room--which began as a mobile title over a decade ago--still ranks as one of the best puzzle games ever made should give you an idea of just how enjoyable it is. The presentation is as simple as it gets--it's a box with puzzles, and as you solve them, the larger box disappears and a smaller box is revealed--but the solutions are dastardly clever, and the accompanying letters add an interesting bit of world-building to the puzzle-solving experience. There have been many Room games released since 2012, but you never forget your first.\n\nLorelei and the Laser Eyes is the kind of puzzle game where taking notes is paramount, as the game's 150 puzzles can be solved in any order you prefer, so if you have to backtrack, you'll want to remember what you've done. It's also the kind of puzzle game that will make you want to solve \"one more puzzle\" to learn more about what's going on in this weird house and who's behind it all. A puzzle game and an interesting mystery? Say no more.\n\nA stream of humans are walking down a path, and you have to lead them to a specific destination. What better way to do this than with a cute little doggo made of light? You'll assign certain actions to humans in the mob as you progress, with strategically placed actions being essential to the overall goal of getting these people where they're going. Humanity hearkens back to the days of Lemmings in a fun and interesting way, and best of all, cute little doggo!\n\n\"MATCH DNA BUBBLES IN AN UNDERGROUND LAB TO KEEP YOUR PSYCHIC CLONE FROM INVADING YOUR MIND AND TURNING YOU INTO A CANNIBAL.\" That's the game's official description on its Steam page, and frankly it sets the tone pretty well. Battling the many dinos and rednecks in the creepy mansion is done through a match-3 puzzle system, and the wacky enemies keep a smile on your face while you're doing it. The story is a commentary on video games as a whole too, which explains the \"3\" in the title--don't go looking for Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 1 or 2 … they don't actually exist.\n\nRise of the Golden Idol couples stellar storytelling with a simple point-and-click system, where finding names, actions, and other important terms through investigation allows you to (literally) fill in the blanks on what's going down in the scene in front of you. The overarching story has a lot of interesting twists and turns, and you'll never actually know what's coming next, but that's part of the fun. Color Gray Games has a true hit on their hands with the Golden Idol series.\n\nPuzzle Quest 2 frames a high fantasy story with elves, orcs, and magic within a match-3 format, and it was a big inspiration to similar games that followed--like the previously mentioned Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3. Each colored gem holds a specific attribute when matched--red, for example, increases the chance of a critical hit on the next attack--and your abilities rely on the class you choose at the beginning of the game--Barbarian, Sorcerer, Assassin, and Templar. There have been sequels and spin-offs, but for the peak Puzzle Quest experience, Puzzle Quest 2 is the one to check out.\n\nAnimal Well is a pixelated and atmospheric puzzle game that sees you dive down into the depths of a dark and mysterious world. You'll need to solve a variety of puzzles, interact with the environment, and deal with dozens of different creatures to find a path forward and progress to a new level. As you move along, you can place candles on the ground to light up your surroundings so you can attempt to uncover some secrets or potentially a new item to aid you in your journey. Animal Well is completely nonlinear as well, so you can explore the game at your own pace and follow whichever path you want.\n\nAntichamber is an older puzzle game, but it's one that still holds up extremely well today. It's clearly inspired by the Portal series, but it's much different from those experiences. For starters, the graphics look like they were drawn onto your screen with a pencil, which takes some time to adjust to. Once you do, you have to somehow navigate your way through mind-bending halls that all connect in some shape or fashion. You'll also encounter a number of geometric objects that don't obey the laws of physics in any way. To deal with everything in your path, you're given a matter gun that can manipulate objects and space around you, and this tool is imperative to solving the numerous puzzles that emerge as you try and explore more of the areas Antichamber offers.\n\nLingo 2 is an in-depth puzzle game that has a little something for every player. It features a wide array of different kinds of puzzles, ranging from word puzzles to geometry problems. The entire map in Lingo 2 unfolds as you explore it, and that only happens as you solve more puzzles that you come across. The game only features puzzles, so don't worry about any jump scares or tricky combat to interrupt your puzzle-solving flow.\n\nWhen it comes to traditional puzzle games, Split Fiction doesn't fall as neatly into the genre as others on this list. However, there are a large number of puzzles to solve throughout this co-op action-adventure game that should satisfy any puzzle fan's craving. Split Fiction needs to be played with another person, and with your partner, you'll enter different levels brought to life by two authors, who are the characters you control in split-screen action. The game features action-packed combat, heart-warming storytelling, and plenty of puzzles featured in both the main story and side activities. If you have someone to play with, Split Fiction will surprise you even if you don't traditionally play these types of games.",

    "fullText": "and \n Joey Carr\n on January 6, 2026 at 11:54AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nIt was Ultima creator Richard Garriott who first coined the term MMORPG--massively multiplayer online role-playing game--to describe 1997's Ultima Online. Flash-forward to 2026, and many of the best MMORPGs to play today are ones that embody the same elements that made early classics like EverQuest, Asheron's Call, and Ultima Online so popular: namely, long-term character progression and persistent online worlds filled with hundreds or even thousands of other players to meet, compete against, or interact with.\n\nWorld of Warcraft helped break MMORPGs into the mainstream when it first released in 2004, making many of the genre's signature ideas more appealing to a wider audience. For a few years after its release, it seemed like every major video game publisher wanted to copy Blizzard's formula (and monthly subscription-based revenue), and MMORPGs became a hot new genre.\n\nUnfortunately, few of the games that chased WoW's success found much of their own. Publishers soured on the genre before too long, resulting in a draught of new MMORPGs over the last decade when compared to other popular game genres (even if many of them, like some of the best survival games or multiplayer shooters, now borrow heavily from MMORPGs). As a result, many of the most popular games MMORPGs today are the same titles that were popular in the early-mid 2000s. Some have existed for decades and require subscriptions to play, even as others have more recently shifted to a free-to-play model.\n\nThere's never been a better time to get lost in a living, breathing online world, something only the best MMORPGs can provide. Below you'll find a list, in no particular order, of some of the top MMORPGs to play in 2026, ranging from tried-and-true classics of the genre to hybrids that combine the best of traditional fantasy-themed MMOs with elements of shooters, space exploration, and more. Some of the games below also happen to be some of the best free-to-play games available.\n\nBlizzard might not have invented the MMORPG, but it certainly popularized it, as it took a genre known for having a steep learning curve and made it more approachable than ever before with streamlined mechanics, punchy combat, instanced dungeons and raids, and its signature level of polish. As a result, WoW is still going strong today and remains one of the best PC MMORPGs to play, having received nine expansions to date (with a 10th on the way). In WoW, players choose a faction--the Alliance or the Horde--as well as a race and class, and from there embark on an adventure to defend the fantasy world of Azeroth from all manner of threats. Each of the game's 13 classes feels distinct, with multiple sub-classes to choose from, and there's an ever-expanding list of fantasy races to play as and customize.\n\nWoW celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2024, as Blizzard kicked-off a three-expansion storyline called The Worldsoul Saga with the release of the game's excellent and approachable The War Within expansion. Blizzard celebrated WoW's big anniversary by dropping some big news as well--after two decades, WoW will finally receive player housing as part of its next expansion, and in a recent preview made clear that unlike in some MMOs, housing in WoW will be available for everyone.\n\nWhile the main version of WoW has continued to evolve over the last 20 years, a large and vocal contingent of fans yearned for the early days of the MMO, before more-recent expansions forever transformed the game's world and Blizzard updated much of its visuals, gameplay, and classes. Blizzard finally listened in 2019 with the release of WoW Classic, a return to the game's earliest, pre-expansion days.\n\nWoW Classic's release proved to be a huge success, and Blizzard now offers multiple different flavors of old-school WoW all under one subscription price, one that also grants access to the modern version of WoW. Players can still check out the 2004-era version of Azeroth (which received new servers to start fresh on in November 2024 for the game's 20th anniversary), or move forward in time and play one of the game's older expansions, like 2010's Cataclysm (soon to be 2012's Mists of Pandaria). There are even seasonal servers, like the still ongoing Season of Discovery, which adds new items, raid content, and class changes to the original version of Blizzard's genre-defining title.\n\nSince the genre's inception, many MMORPGs have featured familiar sword-and-sorcery trappings. It only makes sense then that the granddaddy of the modern fantasy genre, The Lord of the Rings, was a prime candidate to get the MMO treatment following the massive success of WoW. Enter The Lord of the Rings Online, a game that couldn't have come from a more veteran MMORPG team, with developer Turbine having been responsible for MMO classics like 1999's Asheron's Call and its sequel. The Lord of the Rings Online has since changed developers, but its current developer, Standing Stone Games, is composed of many former Turbine developers. Better yet, it still receives new content updates and expansions, with its most recent, Legacy of Morgoth, having arrived in November 2024.\n\nThough very much following in the footsteps of WoW, it fittingly places a much larger emphasis on story than Blizzard's MMO and delivers a painstakingly detailed version of JRR Tolkien's Middle-earth for players to explore and immerse themselves in.\n\nFinal Fantasy is one of the biggest RPG franchises of all time, and as such has not one, but two MMORPGs to its name. Though 2002's Final Fantasy XI is still playable, it's Square Enix's more-recent MMO, Final Fantasy XIV, that has blossomed into one of the best MMORPGs of all time. When it was first released, it was a critical and commercial failure. But several years and many updates later, the game was re-released as Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, completely reworking many of the original game's systems, story, and structure. Now, Final Fantasy XIV is one of the top MMORPG games today and one of the best PS5 and Xbox MMORPGs available, having long been playable on PlayStation and more recently launching on Xbox Series X|S.\n\nIts flexible job system means players don't need to create a new character every time they want to try a new role, and despite being a MMORPG with a massive shared world to explore, its main story, over-the-top boss battles, and excellent music all deliver on what RPG fans expect from a game sharing the Final Fantasy name. Its latest expansion, Dawntrail, released in July 2024.\n\nFuncom is no stranger to MMORPGs, having previously made titles like Anarchy Online and Age of Conan. The studio's latest foray into the genre is its most ambitious yet, adapting author Frank Herbert's sci-fi Dune saga into a massive survival MMORPG where players battle to survive on the harsh desert world of Arakkis. Dune: Awakening is definitely a survival game first and foremost, with players needing to gather resources, manage their water levels, build shelter, and advance their gear to progress.\n\nHowever, MMO staples like faction reputation, class-skill trees, open-world dungeons, and a massive, ever-changing endgame PvP zone that brings together hundreds of players also firmly make Dune: Awakening a MMORPG. Its unique mix of third-person shooting, melee, and vehicular combat helps to further distinguish it from the many fantasy-themed MMOs on the market, making for an enticing combination of genres, gameplay, and aesthetics. Just keep in mind that getting killed by one of the desert's massive sandworms means losing everything on your character at that moment--the desert claims the weak.\n\nOne of the first big new MMORPGs in years, Amazon's New World made quite a splash when it released in 2021, breaking concurrent player records on Steam. The hype has since died down quite a bit, but New World is still an extremely solid MMORPG that received a major overhaul on PC and launched on consoles in the form of New World: Aeternum in October 2024. In New World: Aeternum, players wash up the mysterious island from which the game takes its name, one that has trapped various civilizations and explorers from throughout human history. From there they join one of three different factions, each with their own idea of what to do with the mystical land they now call home. Instead of classes, players instead can equip two different weapon types, which define what skills can be used and what stats a player may want to strive for when gearing their character.\n\nThe New World: Aeternum update bundled in the game's sole expansion, and in the process significantly reworked much of the game's story and its early-game questing, two of its biggest weaknesses prior to the update. Amazon also recently debuted seasonal servers that change up New World: Aeternum's normal gameplay in major ways, ranging from servers that put a heavy focus on open-world PvP to \"hardcore\" servers with faster progression where the goal is to never die even once.\n\nThe developer behind the Halo series took many of the ideas popularized in MMORPGs like WoW--dungeons, raids, classes, special abilities, color-coated loot--and applied it to a smaller-scale, sci-fi FPS. The result was Destiny and its sequel, Destiny 2. Bungie has proven it's still king when it comes to making a great-feeling shooter, and it never gets old blasting ancient aliens or genocidal robots with all manner of Destiny's 2 powerful Exotic weapons. When combined with the social elements of MMOs like shared worlds to explore, larger-scale public events, and multiplayer dungeons and raids filled with complex puzzles and mechanics, Destiny 2 forms an impressive genre cocktail that can be hard to put down.\n\nEverything Bungie has been building towards for over a decade may have culminated in 2024's The Final Shape expansion, but Destiny 2 is still receiving new updates and expansions, with the new Edge of Fate expansion releasing July 15. Destiny 2 is also widely available, making it both one of the best cross-platform games to play with friends and one of the best PS5 and Xbox MMORPG games out there.\n\nGuild Wars 2 was a breath of fresh air when it released in 2012, and for good reason. It put a new spin on many of the tried-and-true tropes and systems seen in popular MMORPGs like WoW, with an emphasis on open-world content. Combined with its flashy movement, impressive visuals compared to many other MMOs, and engaging combat that combines class skills with unique weapon abilities, Guild Wars 2 still stands out from the competition as one of the top MMORPG games available on PC.\n\nIn 2025, Guild Wars 2 is still regularly receiving new updates and expansions, in part thanks to a recent restructuring of how developer ArenaNet develops new content. Its latest expansion, Janthir Wilds, introduced several new big features, including player housing and the spear weapon-type. Unlike many of the biggest MMORPGs, Guild Wars 2 doesn't require a subscription to play, making it an appealing choice for aspiring MMO players on a budget.\n\nOne of the more popular Korean MMORPGs, Lost Ark came to the West with the help of Amazon Games and quickly set itself apart thanks to its isometric perspective and lack of a box price or mandatory subscription fee. In Lost Ark, players choose a class and then embark on a quest to discover the titular lost Arks scattered throughout the fantasy world of Arkesia. It's a journey that takes players to both huge, story-heavy new continents and to small, one-off islands that are home to some truly fun minigame events, all which players sail to on their own personal boat.\n\nSprinkle in some truly fantastic endgame raids and impressive Monster Hunter-like boss battles, and Lost Ark is well worth playing for those looking for a MMORPG that plays closer to some of the best Diablo-like games than it does WoW, albeit minus the fountains of loot. Three years later, the game is still receiving frequent updates, with a new class, the shapeshifting Wildsoul, debuting in February 2025.\n\nFallout 76 didn't exactly have a smooth start in 2018, with players criticizing it for a laundry list of bugs, performance issues, lack of NPC characters, and more. But Bethesda never gave up on its multiplayer Fallout experiment, and in 2025, Fallout 76 is a great way to experience one of gaming's best RPG universes alongside dozens of other players.\n\nLike traditional Fallout games, players scrounge their way through an apocalyptic wasteland on the hunt for supplies and gear. Unlike single-player entries in the franchise, however, dozens of players in Fallout 76 can team up to fend off waves of Super Mutants, battle massive monsters as part of the game's numerous public events, or even drop nukes on one another. Bethesda added Expeditions to the list of things to do in Fallout 76 back in 2022. These allow players to team up and venture outside the game's Appalachian Wasteland to other scenic locales, like Fallout 3's The Pitt, for dungeon-like missions, further giving the FPS RPG a distinct MMO flavor.\n\nFallout 76 has seen a resurgence in interest thanks to the launch of the TV show adaptation, making this a great time to jump in. Its most recent content update, Gone Fission, added fishing as a new activity, with players able to complete various fishing-themed quests and upgrade their fishing pole to tackle new challenges. For more on the franchise, check out our look at the best Fallout games.\n\nStar Wars: The Old Republic will feel familiar to anyone who has played WoW but is no less worthy a time investment for those looking to dive deeper into the Star Wars universe. Originally developed by BioWare, a studio known for its RPG storytelling, Star Wars: The Old Republic unsurprisingly puts its story front and center, with dialogue wheels, fully voiced characters, and impactful narrative choices that feel right at home in a single-player RPG. It also features unique storylines for each of the game's eight classes, meaning there is plenty of replay value for players who can't make up their mind on which class to play. As much as it emulates WoW in its gameplay, Star Wars: The Old Republic does include features that have yet to come to Blizzard's MMO, including player housing and NPC companions.\n\nThough the game recently changed developers (with some former members of BioWare joining Broadsword, which also oversees classic MMORPGs owned by EA like Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot), it still receives new story content and events, making it the top MMORPG game for Star Wars fans and one of the best Star Wars games of all time.\n\nWhile it may still be quite some time until The Elder Scrolls 6, those longing for a return to Tamriel will find plenty to enjoy in The Elder Scrolls Online, which celebrated its 10th anniversary last year. The MMORPG spin on Bethesda's popular RPG series will feel familiar to those who have played single-player entries in the franchise, with the ability to play in first or third-person, NPC companions, various guilds to join, options to steal from NPCs, and more. Players choose an assortment of skills both from their chosen weapon and armor type but also their class in order to make unique builds that can be used to conquer dungeons and raids with other players. Compared to other, more-traditional MMORPGs playable on consoles, its smaller number of skills and easy-to-read user interface make ESO one of the top Xbox and PS5 MMORPG games, even if it sadly doesn't support cross-play or cross-progression across platforms.\n\nIn 2025, developer ZeniMax Online is making some big changes to ESO's content schedule. It's forgoing the yearly expansion model used for almost a decade and instead focusing on smaller, more frequent seasonal updates that will help to deliver on efforts to improve the game across the board. Those efforts include major experiments like Cyrodiil Champions meant to improve the MMO's open-world PvP and a renewed focus on the new and returning player experience. Its current season, Seasons of the Worm Cult, continues the base game's main storyline, while a free update for all players in June added the ability to subclass, allowing for the mixing and matching of abilities from different classes in order to create entirely new playstyles.\n\nIt may not look like much, but Runescape, which is now in its 23rd year and comes in both its slightly-more-modern Runescape 3 form as well as Old School Runescape, is still one of the best MMORPG games of all time. It may be simple by modern standards, but there is a certain joy to be found in its point-and-click gameplay and its monotonous, yet satisfying, crafting skill grind.\n\nLike all great sandbox MMORPGs, Runescape largely leaves players to decide for themselves what interests to pursue, whether it's completing quests, mastering their crafting skills, or player-killing out in the Wilderness. It's one of the few great mobile MMORPG games available, complete with cross-play and cross-progression across platforms. Those who want to get the full Runescape experience will likely want to Jagex recently announced the first new skill in Old School Runescape history, sailing, will be added later in 2025.\n\nFor those who want a little more Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (with a large dose of anime) in their MMORPG, Tower of Fantasy is exactly what the doctor ordered. It shares plenty of DNA with the more-popular (but also largely single-player) Genshin Impact, but distinguishes itself with its shared open world, public events, co-op dungeons and a more sci-fi aesthetic. There's always something to explore, and it's easy to climb any mountain or glide to any distant spot that sparks interest. Similar to Genshin, its character-swapping action combat combined with each character's various elemental affinities keeps Tower of Fantasy's moment-to-moment gameplay interesting, especially as players earn new characters, form teams, and create new combos.\n\nThough players are more than capable of playing through its main story and many of its challenges with the game's various free characters, be warned that this is a gacha game, and many of its best characters will be inaccessible without spending large sums of money on the premium currency used to make luck-of-the-draw pulls.\n\nLike Destiny 2, Warframe isn't what many players would think of when it comes to a traditional MMORPG, but it has so many elements of the genre--shared spaces with large numbers of players, instanced dungeons and raids, high levels of customizability, crafting, guilds, etc.--that it's an MMO in all but name. Warframe has been around for over a decade, and in that time has continued to deliver best-in-class third-person-shooter gameplay alongside game-changing updates that have introduced spaceship combat, large-scale open worlds, and new story content to its sci-fi, cyber-ninja-filled universe.\n\nWith a \"Very Positive\" average user review score after over half a million reviews and counting on Steam, Warframe continues to impress, and features cross-play and cross-progression across PC, iOS, and consoles. It's also available on Nintendo Switch, making it one of the best Switch MMORPG games. A fantasy-themed successor, Soulframe, is slated to receive an open pre-alpha playtest this year.\n\nA top-down fantasy MMORPG that will look and feel familiar to Runescape fans, Albion Online takes its sandbox gameplay even further, with an almost entirely player-run economy, classless combat, and a focus on full-loot PvP with large-scale guild battles over territory. With PvP being such a large part of the endgame, and the high stakes of losing one's items when dying in PvP, Albion Online won't be for everyone.\n\nThere is PvE as well, with dungeons to explore and bosses to slay. For more farming or crafting-minded players, there is also the ability to build a home or even buy a private island and transform it into a farm, too. Few MMORPGs in the modern age truly commit to a sandbox approach like Albion Online, making it more than worth checking out, but those who have no interest in PvP or are easily frustrated by setbacks may want to look elsewhere.\n\nFor those who want to live out a superhero (or villain) fantasy instead of the sword-and-sorcery kind, there's DC Universe Online. Players can create their character, choose from a number of different powers, customize their costume, and then fight alongside iconic DC characters while exploring locations like Gotham City, Metropolis, and Arkham Asylum. DC Universe Online has been going steady for 14 years now and still receives multiple new episodic story updates for free each year. The latest episode, the Lantern Corp-focused Fearful Day, released in May\n\nAll of DCUO's new story content is free, though those with an optional subscription will be able to enjoy more rewards, character slots, and powers to choose from. DCUO isn't the only superhero MMORPG on the block, but its wide availability on both consoles and PC (and cross-play between PlayStation and PC players) does make it an easy choice for this list.\n\nThrone and Liberty's gameplay will instantly feel familiar to anyone who has played an MMORPG in the last two decades, with tab-targeting combat that heavily evokes WoW's gameplay. Where Throne and Liberty differs is in its impressive graphical fidelity, focus on open-world PvP, skills defined by weapon type instead of classes, and the use of players' animal-shapeshifting forms in order to sprint, glide, and swim around its world of Solisium instead of traditional mounts. Though much of its endgame focus is on large guild vs. guild castle sieges, there is still plenty of PvE content as well, including world events and dungeons.\n\nGiven its free-to-play nature, its endgame can become a bit grindy, but those looking for a satisfying MMORPG without a subscription could do much worse than Throne and Liberty. It's also one of the few MMORPGs on consoles, and, unlike other console MMOs like ESO, supports cross-play between platforms. Its first free expansion, Wilds of Talandre, releases in March 2025 and will introduce a new zone to explore, solo dungeons for players to conquer, and a revamp of its weapon mastery system.\n\nKnown for its massive spaceship battles with thousands of players, EVE Online is still one of the best MMORPGs available after two decades on the market. A true sandbox MMO where players are largely left to pursue their own interests--whether that's engaging in PvP battles or starting a trade empire--the entirety of its player base plays on a single server, and the actions its players take leave a lasting impact both on its in-game universe and its bustling player-driven economy.\n\nEven if its actual gameplay isn't quite as exciting as it might sound on paper (get used to looking at lots of menus and going AFK while your ship completes assigned actions), it's the stakes behind each action that give everything in EVE Online's world meaning. EVE Online can certainly be confusing for new players, but for those who stick with it and get involved with its various player-run communities, it's easy to see why the game is still being played 20 years later.\n\nThe original superhero MMO, 2004's City of Heroes, has found new life after having been taken offline by NCSoft in 2012. A fan server called City of Heroes: Homecoming received an official license to operate the game in 2024, and now City of Heroes is once again playable completely for free, with a volunteer team keeping the game running and updated thanks to player donations.\n\nCity of Heroes stands out thanks to its detailed character creator, where players get to choose not only their powers, but their origin story, costume, and even backstory. From there it's up to players to protect Paragon City as a hero or join the forces of villainy on The Rogues Isle, battling foes and joining Supergroups of other players along the way. Though City of Heroes is somewhat dated by today's standards, there is a reason many players have fond memories of their time with the MMO, as it offers a unique experience that can't be found in other games within the genre, even as games like DC Universe Online and Cryptic's spiritual successor, Champions Online, have since looked to follow in City of Heroes' footsteps.\n\nBlack Desert is a highly in-depth MMORPG that places a major emphasis on combat systems and customization. You might have heard that Black Desert has one of the steepest learning curves of any MMO, and that statement wouldn't be inaccurate. There are over a dozen classes to pick from in Black Desert, and each one offers a totally different way of approaching combat. You'll mostly engage in combat with real players and AI enemies, both of which require the utmost precision and lightning-fast reflexes to defeat. However, Black Desert also offers siege combat, allowing you to participate in large-scale wars in PvE or PvP.\n\nIf combat isn't your main interest, Black Desert features a massively open world with a slew of content to explore. You can complete quests, level up a slew of skills, and hunt for new gear. You'll also be able to customize your character in truly staggering ways, as the game has hundreds of clothing and appearance options.\n\nOnce Human isn't your traditional World of Warcraft-type MMORPG, but it's still a massive role-playing game nonetheless. The game starts by you joining a server and going through a tutorial for how its various mechanics work. Then, you'll be on your own in a huge map that features differently-scaled areas. Each area is available for you to venture into from the start, but the enemies in an area will all be at a specific level. To successfully navigate the areas, you need to level up your character by completing main story quests, which mainly involve the same gameplay loop, and jobs for various NPCs at the hub center of each area.\n\nCombat in Once Human involves guns as well as melee and long-range weapons, and all of the weapons in the game can be crafted at your base. Base-building plays a major role in Once Human, as it's how you unlock a majority of the game's usable content and helps to level up your character. When you venture outside your base, though, you'll have to keep your character healthy, as Once Human is also a survival game that has a hunger, thirst, and stamina bar, all of which need to be constantly maintained. It's a unique MMO experience that relies less on multiplayer elements, but other real players are still packed into a server with you.\n\nThe First Descendant is a game that falls somewhere in between a few different genres. However, by definition, it's a massively multiplayer online game that features role-playing elements. At its core, however, The First Descendant is a looter shooter that allows you to team up with other players to complete PvE objectives and defeat bosses. There is no PvP combat, but there's certainly enough content to keep you invested. The looting, which comes from defeating enemies and quests, is mostly RNG, so you'll often have to grind for hours to unlock a piece of content for your character or weapons. The gameplay is extremely enjoyable, though, so you'll often have no quarrel with grinding out gear.\n\nPalia is one of the very few MMORPGs that doesn't feature any sort of combat. Instead, you're placed in a world where you're tasked with building your dream home. Set in a fantasy world, Palia also falls into the life-simulator genre, allowing you to build and create anything your imagination can cook up. Of course, not everything is handed to you, as you'll have to venture out into the world to explore the various towns and other environments. Everywhere in Palia is teeming with life, and you'll even meet other players in the various hub areas, or you can visit them at the home they've built. Palia also offers plenty of lore that you learn as you explore, making it feel like you're a part of a real community.",

    "description": "A speculative ‘Episode 14’ of 'Civilisation' in the spirit of Kenneth Clark, observing how courtesy, discipline, curiosity, conscience, and patience shaped the invisible civic infrastructure of the digital age.",
    "fullText": "When this series last ended in 1969, Kenneth Clark left behind an unease. The modern world possessed immense energy and extraordinary technical power, yet what earlier civilisations had assumed almost instinctively — a centre — was no longer obvious.\n\nIn the decades since, progress has only accelerated. Communication has become global, calculation instantaneous, and information pervasive. These achievements are remarkable. But power alone does not create civilisation. Energy, however abundant, does not by itself produce order. Without shared forms — without agreement about how knowledge is shaped, preserved, and handed on — progress becomes empty motion.\n\nAnd yet civilisation did not collapse.\n\nWe did not abandon the physical world — we still enjoy good food, need sleep, and seek shelter from the cold. But the centre of our shared life began to shift. Increasingly, what mattered most was not the mass of things we possessed, but the structures through which we cooperated: the ways knowledge was recorded, shared, corrected, and carried forward. In these invisible arrangements, civilisation found new means of continuity.\n\nIt is this reconfiguration — subtle, incomplete, and still fragile — that I want to consider here.\n\nThis development was not, in truth, without precedent. Civilisation has never been sustained by authority alone. Even in periods of strong government or settled belief, its real work has relied on voluntary association — on people choosing to cooperate around a shared purpose worth sustaining.\n\nIn the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, this impulse found expression in what came to be known as the Republic of Letters. It was a territory defined not by borders, but by ink. Ideas travelled slowly between desks and studies, often ignoring the wars of their kings. A philosopher in Paris could dispute first principles with a mathematician in Cambridge; a writer in exile could remain part of a continental conversation.\n\nThey shared no ruler and acknowledged no single doctrine. They differed sharply in temperament and belief, yet understood themselves to be citizens of the same country. What bound them were standards: of evidence, of argument, and of courtesy. Knowledge, in this world, was not a possession to be hoarded, but a light to be shared.\n\nFor a long time, this spirit receded from view. The industrial age taught us the virtues of enclosure. We built fences around land, walls around factories, and increasingly, legal barriers around ideas. Where value was material, scarce, and costly to produce, ownership became the principal means by which it was recognised and protected — and it still serves us well.\n\nBut toward the end of the twentieth century, a curious pattern re-emerged. Among scientists, engineers, and students working at the edges of a new digital machinery, the established forms of enclosure proved inadequate. To build systems of great complexity with unprecedented reach, one could not behave solely as a proprietor. One had to act, instead, as a participant.\n\nGradually, and without central direction, new commons took shape. Spaces in which the work of one person was offered to the use of many; in which contribution mattered more than possession; and in which rules were sustained not by decree, but by shared understanding. These arrangements relied on a quiet optimism — the belief that human beings, given the opportunity, would prefer to build together rather than to destroy alone.\n\nThey remain fragile. They are easily misunderstood, and easily neglected. Yet upon this assumption — modest, generous, and profoundly human — much of our contemporary civilisation has come to rest.\n\nThe reordering of our digital world began, fittingly, not in a marketplace, but in a place of inquiry. By the late 1980s, computers were already powerful and networks increasingly widespread, yet information remained confined within isolated systems. To move from one to another required a change of language, protocol, or machine. Knowledge existed, but it did not yet flow.\n\nTim Berners-Lee, then working as a physicist and engineer, recognised in this fragmentation something deeper than technical inconvenience: an obstacle to the exchange of ideas. He proposed a simple remedy: a way for documents on different computers to be linked together, addressed through common rules, and retrieved by anyone connected to the network. The means were spare—uniform addresses, shared protocols, plain documents.\n\nAt the time, the prevailing logic was clear. New technologies were enclosed, patented, licensed. They became assets, and then territories. This approach had shaped much of the modern world, and often served it well. But Berners-Lee declined it. He did not claim ownership of the Web, nor place it behind fees or permissions. Instead, he released its protocols openly, allowing anyone to use and build upon them.\n\nThe decision appeared almost administrative. In retrospect, it was decisive. A system intended to connect the world could not begin by demanding entry. By refusing to own the Web, Berners-Lee allowed it to function as neutral ground — a public space without a gatekeeper.\n\nClark once described courtesy as the discipline by which we restrain our own claims in order to make room for others. In this sense, the Web was an act of courtesy expressed in technology. Its enduring power lies as much in its refusals as in its capabilities.\n\nFrom that restraint flowed much that followed.\n\nIf the Web was founded on an act of courtesy, the system that made it durable was built on something more bracing: an uncompromising respect for how things actually work.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Linus Torvalds, then a student at the University of Helsinki, began writing the core of an operating system. The impulse was practical rather than ideological. His professor, Andrew S. Tanenbaum, had created MINIX—an elegant, Unix-inspired teaching system—so that students could study the anatomy of an operating system. But MINIX was not intended for everyday use, and it did not run on Torvalds’s own machine in the way he required.\n\nOut of a mixture of curiosity and irritation, he decided to build something that would.\n\nWhat is striking, even in hindsight, is how complete that decision already was. The earliest public release of Linux was not a sketch or a manifesto. It was a working kernel: multitasking, memory-managed, architecturally coherent. It revealed, from the outset, a deep and practical understanding of how operating systems behave under real constraints. Authority, in this case, did not need to be asserted. It was visible in the code.\n\nWhen the system reached a point where others might find it useful, Torvalds released it with a plain invitation: use it, improve it, tell me what breaks.\n\nThere was no manifesto and no appeal to higher ideals. There was simply work to be done.\n\nHe did not come to this characteristic pragmatism from a vacuum. He had begun programming at the age of eleven, and grew up in a household where intellectual argument was neither rare nor intimidating. His parents were journalists, his grandfather a statistician. Ideas, facts, and disagreement were part of ordinary conversation, not marks of authority.\n\nHe was named, with ambiguity, after the scientist and peace activist Linus Pauling—or, as he later remarked, perhaps equally after the Linus from Peanuts. The joke is revealing. It suggests a temperament comfortable with seriousness, but resistant to solemnity; respectful of ideas, but impatient with reverence.\n\nThat impatience would become legendary. Torvalds was blunt, intolerant of sloppy reasoning, and openly dismissive of work that failed to meet clear standards. In another setting, such a manner might have proved destructive. In this one, it served a clarifying purpose.\n\nWhat emerged around Linux surprised almost everyone. Programmers from across the world began to contribute—not because they were commanded to, and not because they were paid, but because the standards were unmistakable and the results visible. Authority arose where competence was demonstrated. Disputes were frequent, sometimes fierce, but they were settled not by rank, but by the quality of the work itself.\n\nLinux showed that order need not depend on hierarchy. It could arise from shared standards, rigorous review, and a willingness to reject what did not meet them. The collaboration endured not because everyone agreed, but because disagreement was channelled into improvement rather than paralysis.\n\nToday, the result of that discipline is so pervasive that it has become effectively invisible. Linux runs the watch on a wrist and the rocket in the void; it governs the flow of global finance and the monitors of intensive care. The banker, the surgeon, and the statesman rely upon it every second of their lives, yet few could name it—or the man who began it. It has become the silent, universal substrate of modern civilisation.\n\nAs the project grew, a new problem appeared. The accumulation of changes—branching paths, conflicting versions, overlapping experiments—threatened to overwhelm its own history. Torvalds’s response was direct. He built a tool to address the problem properly, from first principles, in a matter of days.\n\nIt is an obstinate word for an obstinate tool. Torvalds explained the choice with a certain wry self-knowledge: “I’m an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself.” This joke was a refusal to pretend otherwise.\n\nGit altered the way collective memory was handled. Instead of a single, authorised record guarded at the centre, it allowed every participant to hold a complete and inspectable history. Experiments could diverge without endangering the whole, and failures could be acknowledged without erasure. Continuity was preserved without supervision, and responsibility without humiliation.\n\nIn civilisational terms, this was no small matter. Git provided what large institutions have always struggled to maintain: a reliable memory that tolerates error while remaining accountable. It made cooperation at scale possible, and more importantly, sustainable.\n\nTorvalds rarely spoke of these achievements in elevated language, and perhaps that is part of their strength. He distrusted abstraction and disliked ceremony. Yet through an insistence on standards—sometimes uncomfortable, often demanding—he demonstrated that order can emerge without command.\n\nIf Berners-Lee’s restraint made room for others to enter, Torvalds’s discipline made it possible for them to stay—and to build.\n\nWe have spoken of individuals, but civilisation does not advance by solitary effort alone. Ideas endure only when they are taken up, tested, corrected, and carried forward by others. What followed the release of the Web and Linux was therefore not an anomaly, but an ascent — collective, distributed, and largely unplanned.\n\nOut of this discipline grew structures capable of sustaining effort at scale. Organisations such as the Linux Foundation, the Apache Software Foundation, and the Eclipse Foundation did not command creativity so much as shelter it—providing neutral ground where competing firms, independent developers, and public institutions could collaborate without surrendering control to any single interest.\n\nThese great foundations, joined by a constellation of individual efforts, quietly became both the backbone and the surface of the modern world. They supplied the invisible servers and operating systems upon which industry depends, extending that order to the programming languages, development tools, and utility applications that weave through the texture of daily life.\n\nEarlier civilisations had known voluntary scholarship and shared intellectual purpose. What they lacked were the means to sustain such efforts beyond a narrow elite. The Republic of Letters relied on slow correspondence and fragile memory. Here, by contrast, the technical conditions had fallen into place. The Web offered a common space of address; Git provided a disciplined way to coordinate distributed work while preserving the history of every path taken; and systems like Linux supplied a stable, universal substrate at the machine level.\n\nTogether, these tools did not create generosity — but they gave it form, continuity, and reach. Contribution could be preserved rather than lost, disagreement recorded rather than erased, and improvement accumulated without dissolving into chaos. For the first time, cooperation among strangers could be both rigorous and durable.\n\nWhat emerged was neither a utopia nor a rebellion against institutions. It was a practice — demanding, sometimes severe, but remarkably productive. Authority arose where competence was demonstrated, and responsibility where work was accepted. In this way, the invisible commons acquired not only energy, but memory.\n\nIt was a modest beginning, and an unfinished one. But it marked something new in the history of civilisation: a means by which collective effort could outlast enthusiasm, survive disagreement, and leave behind structures strong enough to build upon.\n\nA way, at last, toward permanence.\n\nCivilisations have always faltered not for lack of knowledge, but for lack of finding it. The great library of Alexandria held its wealth in scrolls; the digital commons held it in billions of fragments, scattered and multiplying. The crisis was one of orientation.\n\nIt required a particular kind of genius to address this: not the genius of the poet, who creates new worlds, but the genius of the librarian, who imposes order upon the old.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, then students at Stanford University,approached this problem with an engineer’s impatience with chaos. They recognised that within the tangled mess of the Web, there lay a hidden structure. Links were more than mere decorations; they were judgments. Every reference implied trust, relevance, and attention. If these signals could be measured, the cacophony of human knowledge might order itself, without the need for a central censor.\n\nPage and Brin set out to implement this theory with their own hands. Much of the early system—from the crawling of pages to the ranking of results—was coded by them, tested against the crushing weight of the real Web, and refined through sleepless nights. Their authority rested on a simple, undeniable premise: they had made the thing work.\n\nTheir ambition, expressed with an engineer’s disarming simplicity, was among the broadest in human history:\n\nBasically, our goal is to organize the world’s information and to make it universally accessible and useful.\n\nFew statements have carried such consequence with so little ornament.\n\nWhat emerged was more profound than a commercial search engine — and more consequential than its creators could fully foresee. It was a new cognitive infrastructure, the likes of which had never existed. Questions that once required travel, training, or immense patience could now be answered in moments. Curiosity ceased to be a privilege of the leisured class. It became a habit of the multitude.\n\nThe organisation they built, Google, quickly outgrew its original function. To organise the world’s information at planetary scale required inventions far beyond indexing. It required a new kind of architecture: distributed computation, fault-tolerant systems, and coordination at unprecedented scale. In solving its own problems, Google was forced to become a builder of new civic infrastructure.\n\nHere, the spirit of the commons reasserted itself in an unexpected form. Having built their edifice upon the open foundations of Linux, Page and Brin began to return the scaffolding to the world. They released Android, placing a general-purpose operating system into billions of hands; they gifted Kubernetes, providing a common language for managing complexity across industries.\n\nThese were acts of calculated necessity. They understood that no single organisation—not even one as vast as theirs—could sustain such complex systems alone.\n\nThis created a productive tension. Google became both a citadel of proprietary power and a primary engine of open infrastructure. It demonstrated that in the modern age, collaboration is more than an ideal; it is a structural necessity.\n\nSuch power inevitably casts shadows. To control the map is to influence how others move, and the risks of such centralisation are real. Yet the original impulse remains unmistakable: a belief that knowledge, once organised, should belong to everyone — and that the tools required to manage this complexity should not be locked behind walls.\n\nPage and Brin belong, in Clark’s sense, among the God-given geniuses who realised their own ambitious visions. They recognised a crisis of confusion in the civilisational record, and with their own craft, built a working answer.\n\nCuriosity, once given structure, became infrastructure.\n\nWhat followed would test how the use of such infrastructure should be judged — and at what human cost.\n\nIf the story ended with the triumph of the Web and the ordering of the map, we might be tempted to call it a victory. But history suggests otherwise. When the pace of civilisation accelerates, it often leaves its institutions behind. And in that widening gap, there are casualties.\n\nAaron Swartz stood squarely in that gap.\n\nBorn in 1986 near Chicago, Swartz was a prodigy, a builder, and — in a deeper sense — a conscience. He belonged naturally to the world of the commons we have been describing, fluent in its technical languages and serious about its moral claims. For him, openness was a principle to be acted upon.\n\nHis contributions began with something deceptively modest. He helped create Markdown, a syntax that appears, at first glance, to be nothing more than plain text. Yet this simplicity was a philosophical choice. By stripping away the complex, fragile interfaces of modern word processing, Markdown liberated the writer to focus on the hierarchy of ideas rather than their ornamentation. It restored a necessary discipline to the act of writing, ensuring that the structure of an argument remained visible, honest, and distinct from its display.\n\nBut the implications of this choice extended far beyond the quiet of the study. Swartz understood that for knowledge to endure, it must be separable from the tools used to create it. Because Markdown treated text as structured data, a document was no longer a dead artifact, but an active component of a system. A specification written in this way could be transformed, by the simplest of scripts, into a website, a technical manual, or even executable code. It opened the way for streamlining the chaotic passage from abstract policy to concrete production, creating an unbroken chain between intention and execution.\n\nIn this sense, Markdown pointed toward a form of civic legibility: a way in which the vast records of society—its laws, its data, its history—might remain intelligible to both human eyes and machine logic, safe from the rot of proprietary obsolescence. It was a small tool, but it became the essential mortar for a civilisation built on code.\n\nBut Swartz’s concern for access did not end with tools. He saw that while the machinery of the commons had become open, many of the great storehouses of human knowledge remained closed. Scholarly research — much of it publicly funded — was locked behind paywalls, accessible primarily to those already inside the gates. To Swartz, this inefficiency rose to the level of moral error.\n\nHis response was literal and uncompromising. In 2011, he attempted to make available a large body of academic work, not for profit, but as an assertion of principle. It was an act of civil disobedience, closer in spirit to the old librarians than to the modern hacker stereotype. Where the digital world saw a custodian of knowledge, the institution saw a violator of rules.\n\nThe collision was severe. Swartz encountered a legal and prosecutorial machinery calibrated for deterrence rather than judgment, and example rather than proportion. The weight of the response far exceeded the scale of the act. What followed is well known, and remains difficult to contemplate.\n\nIt would be easy, at this point, to simplify the story — to assign villains and heroes, to turn tragedy into rhetoric. That would be a mistake. The institutions acted from procedure, Swartz from conviction. What failed here was something more elusive: a shared understanding of how ideals, once embedded in technology, should be reflected in law.\n\nClark once insisted that civilisation depends not only on knowledge, but on sympathy — on the capacity to recognise ourselves in others. The tragedy took the form of a collision: between a commons that had learned to move, and institutions that had not yet learned how to follow. Swartz’s life and death force an uncomfortable question: whether a society that builds its future on openness can afford to treat its most literal adherents as adversaries.\n\nHis story marks the point at which the invisible commons ceased to be merely a technical achievement, and became a moral test. It revealed that access, order, and power cannot be aligned by engineering alone. They require judgment and restraint — and, above all, a sense of proportion.\n\nIn the years that followed, the shock of this failure was not entirely absorbed in silence. Laws were re-examined, prosecutorial practices questioned, and the assumption that access could be criminalised without consequence began, slowly, to weaken. Institutions did not become wiser overnight — but they became more aware.\n\nCivilisation learns unevenly, and often at great cost — usually after the fact. Its progress has rarely depended on perfect obedience, and still less on moral comfort. Again and again, it has been forced forward by individuals willing to test the distance between what is lawful and what is just — and to bear the consequences of that test.\n\nAny consolation that remains lies in memory. Swartz’s insistence did not vanish with him. It entered the moral consciousness of the commons itself, where future generations may yet recognise that law, like technology, cannot remain untouched by human consequence.\n\nIn February 2025, a bust of Aaron Swartz was unveiled in the lobby of the Internet Archive in San Francisco — an institution dedicated to preserving the world’s knowledge and keeping it accessible. Its placement is telling: among readers, archives, and use, rather than courts or seats of power. It marks no victory, announces no verdict, and offers no absolution.\n\nIt simply reminds those who pass beneath it that the commons was not built by compliance alone — and that civilisation, if it is to endure, must always leave room for conscience to speak before the law has learned how to listen.\n\nAfter the moral strain of collision, it is necessary to return to first principles — this time of learning itself. Civilisation, after all, is not preserved by systems alone. It is preserved by transmission: by one mind taking the time to explain something carefully to another.\n\nIn 2004, Sal Khan began without a grand design to reform education. He was tutoring a cousin through the web. The subject was mathematics, and the medium he chose was austere: a black screen, a trail of coloured digital ink, and a voice. This created an aesthetic of pure concentration. The learner watched the thought itself unfolding in real time. Unencumbered by institutional theories or the language of disruption, the work relied entirely on the clarity of the explanation.\n\nFrom this modest beginning grew Khan Academy — an online platform that functioned as a repository of patience. Its distinguishing quality lay in its tone. Concepts were broken down slowly, without embarrassment, and rebuilt step by step, treating the learner simply as an unfinished mind requiring only time and method to complete itself.\n\nThis approach addressed a failure that Clark had observed long before. He remarked that the so-called “top people” of earlier generations were often charming but poorly informed, while students in provincial universities were sharper, more curious, and more alert. The barrier between them was access—specifically, access to explanation.\n\nKhan Academy demonstrated that high culture could be shared in its full complexity. Calculus, physics, economics, and history could be made intelligible while remaining rigorous. Explanation, when offered with care, became a form of respect.\n\nHere, the tools of the invisible commons reached their most humane expression. The Web provided reach; search made discovery possible; open infrastructure kept costs low. Yet the motive force was the act of explanation itself. The teacher stood alongside the learner, treating the student as a capable mind, and making learning an act of invitation rather than one of ranking, filtering, or exclusion. This restoration of dignity remains one of the most consequential achievements of the digital age.\n\nIt is striking that a platform of this global reach and massive utility was founded on a single voice, repeated patiently thousands of times. Even as the project expanded, it retained this intimacy. While traditional schools carry responsibilities far beyond explanation, Khan proved that the continuity of knowledge operates independently of hierarchy. It advances most reliably where the responsibility for clarity is personal, continuous, and owned by a human voice.\n\nIn the end, his contribution reminds us of a truth often obscured by scale and abstraction: that alongside genius and conscience, civilisation depends upon explanation—offered freely, received humbly, and carried forward, one mind at a time.\n\nWe have traced a lineage defined less by doctrine than by a series of human gestures: restraint at the beginning, discipline in the making, generosity in collaboration, conscience under strain, and patience in explanation. Taken together, they suggest that the digital age grew around a distinct, if quiet, centre.\n\nThat centre resides beyond the reach of institutions, ideologies, or markets. It lives in a set of practices—ways of working, judging, and explaining—through which knowledge is made durable and meaning carried forward. They are largely invisible, easily neglected, yet without them the energy of an age leaves nothing that lasts.\n\nCivilisation, as Clark understood, is defined by what it chooses to preserve. Permanence emerges through restraint; through the refusal to enclose what could be enclosed; through standards maintained without command; through explanations offered again, for the sake of someone still learning. Far from the habits of conquest, these are the gestures by which civilisation endures.\n\nYet they remain fragile. Tools may embody values, yet judgment cannot be automated. Institutions can preserve order, yet adaptation lags behind change. Genius may illuminate a path, yet sympathy and proportion determine how far that path can be followed. Again and again, endurance depends less on intelligence than on moral habit.\n\nThe digital world now shapes how we learn, how we work, how we remember, and how we judge one another. Whether it will lift civilisation — or merely accelerate it — remains an open question. The answer lies in the care with which these systems are used, extended, and restrained.\n\nCivilisation has always been a provisional achievement. It must be built, maintained, and renewed by each generation. The invisible commons will endure only if it is treated as a trust.\n\nAnd that, perhaps, is the measure of our moment: not whether we can build systems of astonishing complexity, but whether we can give them the forms, the sympathy, and the permanence required to make them worthy of civilisation itself.",

    "description": "An exploration in using Passkeys as generalized cryptographic seed material to address new use cases, while inheriting the benefits of cross-device synced keys with native biomentric UX.",
    "fullText": "In my time at Microsoft, I worked on the team responsible for the development and standardization of Passkeys. Passkeys have made standard, secure, cryptographic authentication accessible to all users, but the model is tightly restricted to website/app login.\n\nEven with a deep, code-level understanding of passkeys and WebAuthn, it wasn’t until now, six years later, that I realized a set of properties and behaviors present within Passkeys could be hijacked to make this post possible. This ‘feature’ was sitting right there and feels so obvious in retrospect. It just goes to show if you remain curious and turn over every rock, you can bend technology to do new and interesting things.\n\nPassSeeds is a hack that explores this question: can we hijack the capabilities and UX of passkeys for use cases that stretch beyond their rigid login model and limited key-type support? The status quo of many Web-based use cases involving long-held cryptographic keys is often users pasting key material into sites/apps or buying special hardware devices that are difficult for less technical folks to use.\n\nTo understand PassSeeds, it helps to have some awareness of the underlying Passkey technology they are based on.\n\nPasskeys are asymmetric key pairs formatted as WebAuthn credentials, typically used to replace passwords for website logins. A key pair is created on the user’s device for a website and stored in a secure hardware module. Access to and usage of these key pairs is scoped to the origin of the site they were created on (for example: example.com, other.example.com, test.com). Passkeys are replicated across a user’s devices by the platform (iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager, Windows Hello, etc.) via an end-to-end encrypted sync process. Below is a basic overview of the two primary UX flows for generating a passkey and using one for login:\n\nThere are several attributes of Passkeys to keep in mind that are critical to the PassSeed mechanism detailed in this post:\n\nGiven these attributes of the Passkey model, even public keys in the system behave like a natively provisioned, hardware-secured, synced secret, even though cryptography does not require them to be secret. This is a rare and valuable set of properties many products, services, and protocols find highly desirable.\n\nPasskeys provide biometrically gated use of cryptographic keys, but they were created specifically for authentication signing in centralized website login flows. Meanwhile, web apps that need cryptographic material and curves that passkeys don’t support (secp256k1 for Bitcoin, BLS12-381 for ZKPs, etc.) remain primitive and convoluted. Users copy 12–24 words, stash JSON keystores, or paste raw keys across apps. PassSeeds introduces a novel approach: treat the passkey’s P‑256 public key itself as seed material and retrieve it on demand through ECDSA public‑key recovery. The authenticator still keeps the private key and user‑verification requirements, but the recovered public‑key bytes become the deterministic PassSeed that can serve as the foundation for other cryptographic use cases.\n\n(If you don’t want to understand how it works, you can skip to the DEMO)\n\nAssumptions: you have created a passkey, did not export the public key anywhere at generation time, and do not allow any signatures from the passkey outside of the generating origin’s local boundary.\n\nRegeneration via ECDSA Key Recovery\n\nRecovery / Rotation\n\nIf a device is lost, but other devices with the passkey that backs the PassSeed are still available, any new device added to the accout of the user will have their PassSeed automatically synced upon device enrollment, which is a process handled by the native platform. If all devices with the backing passkey are lost, you can still access and control whatever was tied to your PassSeed via the exported mnemonic phrase, if you elected to do that (which is strongly recommeded). Because PassSeeds and their backing Passkeys cannot be imported into the Passkey mechanism, if you lose all devices with the backing Passkey, you will need to transfer anything tied to the old PassSeed to a new one on your active devices (again, assuming you backed up your PassSeed via exporting its mnemonic phrase).\n\nTo make the PassSeed user-friendly, the implementation converts the 32-byte PassSeed into a standard BIP-39 mnemonic. In practice, the PassSeed is the SHA-256 hash of the recovered public key, represented as 32 bytes. Users can write down the phrase to ensure that even if something happens to their PassSeed (e.g. they accidentially delete it), they can retain access to the keys it is capable of producing. Rerunning the ECDSA recovery process with the same passkey deterministically yields the same phrase.\n\nOnce you have the PassSeed (public key bytes or its mnemonic-derived entropy), you can deterministically derive other cryptographic material:\n\nThe following are the code snippets for the core methods from the PassSeed TypeScript implementation, avaiable in the PassSeed Github repo. Some of the methods reference helpers that are contained in the module, but are not shown here, for brevity.\n\nThis method orchestrates the complete WebAuthn credential creation flow, extracts the credential’s P-256 public key from the CBOR attestation object, and returns a hex-encoded SHA-256 hash of the public key bytes.\n\nThis method retrieves an existing passkey (optionally by credential ID), performs two WebAuthn signatures over the same challenge, reconstructs the public key via ECDSA recovery by intersecting candidate points from both signatures, and returns the hex-encoded PassSeed string.\n\nThis method converts a 32-byte PassSeed (as bytes or hex) into a human-readable BIP-39 mnemonic phrase for backup and recovery, optionally truncating to 16 bytes for a 12-word phrase before handing entropy to bip39.entropyToMnemonic with the English wordlist.\n\nThe authenticator still enforces RP binding and user verification before issuing signatures, so phishing resistance mirrors standard passkeys. The host page sees two signatures and the recovered public key, values one must assume the host can exfiltrate. Because the same message is signed twice, replay risk is mitigated by including nonces, RP ID, and a strict prefix so signatures cannot be repurposed. Syncable passkeys inherit the platform’s end-to-end encrypted sync features.\n\nThe WebAuthn specification has defined a PRF extension for deterministically generating per-credential secrets, and a Large Blob extension, which can be used to encrypt and save a randomly generated secret that is synced across the user’s devices, both of which could achieve the desired ends. The problem is API support: PRF and Large Blob features are not implemented across browsers today, and there is no signal that either will be in the near future. That makes it hard to rely on in production if you need your app to work everywhere.\n\nPassSeeds can even be used to create a polyfill for the PRF feature: by deterministically recovering a stable cryptographic value from the passkey signature flow (the public key), you can use that value to generate deterministic, cryptographic values based on input values, which will regenerate the same value for the same input, every time. If the tradeoffs of PassSeeds are acceptable, you can integrate PRF-reliant use cases in apps today, across all browsers. I plan on writing a PRF polyfill soon, so stay tuned.\n\nThe following is a demo page that allows you to create PassSeeds, reload the page to test regeneration (via the ECDSA recovery process), and view the Mnemonic phrase of PassSeeds you’ve created: PassSeeds Demo\n\nYou can also include PassSeeds in your Web apps via NPM: PassSeeds NPM Package",

    "fullText": "Jan 6 (Reuters) - Venezuela was loading crude only for U.S. major Chevron on Tuesday, while operations by state-run oil firm PDVSA to load cargoes for its main customers in China ​remained on hold for a fifth day, shipping data showed.\n\nU.S. forces captured President Nicolas Maduro on ‌Saturday and took him to New York to face drug charges. Interim President Delcy Rodriguez is now running the government, which the U.S. ‌has said it will oversee.\n\nThe United States imposed a blockade on sanctioned oil tankers sailing into and out of Venezuelan waters last month, which halted most exports other than those destined for Chevron.\n\nChevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in the country under a U.S. license that exempts it from sanctions imposed by Washington on Venezuela's oil industry ⁠to choke off revenue that financed Maduro's ‌government.\n\nOn Tuesday, several vessels chartered by Chevron were the only ones loading crude for export at Venezuela's Jose and Bajo Grande ports, ship monitoring data showed.\n\nOther ships were loading ‍either to move oil between domestic ports or to store crude because onshore storage was almost completely full, according to PDVSA's internal documents.\n\nThe last crude cargo that was loaded for an Asian customer at Jose finished loading on January 1, according to ​the data and documents. Without more exports, PDVSA could be forced to deepen production cuts it began in ‌recent days because storage tanks are full.\n\nChevron on Monday resumed exports of Venezuelan oil to the U.S. after a four-day pause and called workers abroad back to its Venezuelan offices as flights to the country restarted. The U.S. firm has emerged in recent weeks as the only company fluidly exporting Venezuela's crude.\n\nAt least a dozen vessels under sanctions that had loaded in December and had been stuck in Venezuela's waters due to the embargo sailed in ⁠early January.\n\nThose vessels were carrying around 12 million barrels of ​crude and fuel. It was unclear where the vessels were heading, ​although they were initially loaded for customers in China. The ships left in \"dark mode,\" which means that transponders that send out their location were switched off. The vessels appeared to break ‍the U.S. tanker blockade.\n\nThe U.S. ⁠government has not commented on the vessels or whether it authorized the departures.

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — Pamela Smart, who is serving life in prison for orchestrating the murder of her husband by her teenage student in 1990, is seeking to overturn her conviction over what her lawyers claim were several constitutional violations.\n\nThe petition for habeas corpus relief was filed Monday in New York, where she is being held at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women, and, in New Hampshire, where the murder happened.\n\n“Ms. Smart’s trial unfolded in an environment that no court had previously confronted — wall-to-wall media coverage that blurred the line between allegation and evidence,” Jason Ott, who is part of Smart’s legal team, said in a statement. “This petition challenges whether a fair adversarial process took place.”\n\nThe move comes about seven months after New Hampshire Gov. Kelly Ayotte rejected a request for a sentence reduction hearing. Ayotte said she reviewed the case and decided it was not deserving of a hearing.\n\nA spokesman for the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision said it would have no comment about the petition.\n\nA spokeman for New Hampshire’s attorney general said it would not comment on pending litigation “other than to note that the State maintains Ms. Smart received a fair trial and that her convictions were lawfully obtained and upheld on appeal.”\n\nIn their petition, lawyers for the 57-year-old Smart argue that prosecutors misled the jury by providing them with inaccurate transcripts of surreptitiously recorded conversations of Ms. Smart that included words that were not audible on the recordings. Among the words they claim weren't audible but in the transcript were the word killed in the sentence “you had your husband killed,\" the word busted in the sentence “I'm gonna be busted\" and the word murder in the sentence “this would have been the perfect murder.”\n\n“Modern science confirms what common sense has always told us: when people are handed a script, they inevitably hear the words they are shown,” Smart’s attorney, Matthew Zernhelt, said in a statement. “Jurors were not evaluating the recordings independently — they were being directed toward a conclusion, and that direction decided the verdict.”\n\nLawyers also argued the conviction should be overturned because the verdict was tainted by the media attention and due to faulty instructions to the jury. They argued jurors were told they must find that Smart acted with premeditation, not told they must consider only evidence presented at trial.\n\nThey also argued the trial court gave her a mandatory life sentence without parole for being an accomplice to first-degree murder, despite New Hampshire not mandating that sentence for the charge.\n\nSmart was a 22-year-old high school media coordinator when she began an affair with a 15-year-old boy who later fatally shot her husband, Gregory Smart, in Derry. The shooter was freed in 2015 after serving a 25-year sentence. Although Smart denied knowledge of the plot, she was convicted of being an accomplice to first-degree murder and other crimes and sentenced to life without parole.\n\nIt took until 2024 for Smart to take full responsibility for her husband’s death. In a video released in June, she said she spent years deflecting blame “almost as if it was a coping mechanism.”\n\nSmart’s trial was a media circus and one of America’s first high-profile cases about a sexual affair between a school employee and a student. The student, William Flynn, testified that Smart told him she needed her husband killed because she feared she would lose everything if they divorced and that she threatened to break up with him if he didn't kill her husband. Flynn and three other teens cooperated with prosecutors and all have since been released.\n\nFlynn and 17-year-old Patrick Randall entered the Smarts’ Derry condominium and forced Gregory Smart to his knees in the foyer. As Randall held a knife to the man’s throat, Flynn fired a hollow-point bullet into his head. Both pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and were sentenced to 28 years to life. They were granted parole in 2015. Two other teenagers served prison sentences and have been released.\n\nThe case inspired Joyce Maynard’s 1992 book “To Die For” and the 1995 film of the same name, starring Nicole Kidman and Joaquin Phoenix.",

    "fullText": "If you want to doomscroll less this year, try these realistic tips from screen time coaches\n\nSimple daily rituals for building fun, calm and play into your days in 2026\n\nI wish time travel were real. If it were, I’d go back to 2006 – the year before the release of the first iPhone. A time when doomscrolling didn’t exist, and the thought of a phone call didn’t cause me a rush of anxiety.\n\nAnd many Americans agree. On social media, some are already labeling 2026 “the age of analog”, swapping Spotify for a record player and a smartphone lens for a film camera.\n\nPlenty of advice already exists out there on how to reduce screen time. But we were on the hunt for unique tips that went beyond silencing phone notifications or setting time limits.\n\nI asked for advice from a slew of experts who study addiction and digital detoxing and have written best-selling books on managing screen time (we’ve shared them in a reading list below). From putting a rubber band around your phone to writing a breakup letter to it, below are realistic 15 strategies that might actually help cut down on scrolling.\n\nIf you’re feeling very brave, make sure to read our last (and most vulnerable) tip. Then, at the very end, get some inspiration for screen-free activities from the Filter team.\n\nPower On: Managing Screen Time to Benefit the Whole Family by Ash Brandin\n\nDopamine Nation by Dr Anna Lembke\n\nThe Official Dopamine Nation Workbook by Dr Anna Lembke\n\nHow to Break Up with Your Phone by Catherine Price\n\nThe Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in a High-Tech World by Adam Gazzaley and Dr Larry Rosen\n\nBefore doing anything, view how much you’re currently averaging in your smartphone’s stats.\n\nIt also helps to become mindful of when you choose to pick up your phone – and what you’re feeling at the time. Bored? Stressed? “Sometimes it just helps me to ask: what need is this meeting? What is it I’m seeking? What am I trying to get from this?” said Ash Brandin, an educator and author of Power On.\n\nYou can also try a physical reminder to pause. “One thing I often suggest is that you put a rubber band or a hair tie around your phone for a couple of days,” said health journalist Catherine Price, the author of How to Break Up with Your Phone and The Power of Fun. “When you reach for your phone on autopilot, you think: why is that on my phone?”\n\nYou could set a time limit for using an app, but that often doesn’t work – and can even increase your screen time, according to a study conducted by Dr Jordan Etkin, a Duke University professor who researches how people set goals. Instead, she recommended setting “hard limits”, which means a limit that can’t be changed once set.\n\nTo set a “hard limit”, Price suggested apps such as Opal and Freedom, which allow you to put apps and websites on a “block list” and schedule focus sessions. Freedom (which offers a free trial) also lets you sync multiple devices and offers a “locked” mode to help you resist ending a session early.\n\nThis turns your phone into “a tool that helps you do the things you want to do, that doesn’t suck away at your life”, she said. Price is also a fan of Brick, a physical tool that locks you out of distracting apps of your choosing until you use your phone to unlock them.\n\nIf the mere sight of your phone leaves you with the urge to scroll, try putting it somewhere that makes you have to look for it.\n\n“If you’re at work and you want to focus, keep your phone in your bag or in your jacket,” said Dr Kostadin Kushlev, who has researched the benefits of “digital detoxing” at Georgetown University.\n\nAt night, Price recommended leaving your phone outside of your bedroom and swapping your smartphone’s alarm for a physical alarm clock. (Price’s husband uses this retro table clock.) Otherwise, after seeing all your notifications, “you’re guaranteed that you’re going to start your day on someone else’s terms,” she said.\n\nIf you find yourself doomscrolling in your free time, try taking up a screen-free activity or hobby.\n\n“Make it less about trying to cut back and more about filling our lives with things that we enjoy,” said Price, who enjoys jamming out on the drums in her spare time.\n\nAnd if you aren’t sure where to start, Brandin advised figuring out what purpose your phone is fulfilling and translating it to offline hobbies. For instance, if you resort to task-oriented games such as Candy Crush for a mindless distraction, try a crochet kit.\n\nIt can feel too easy to pick up your phone when you have a free second.\n\nTo make it less convenient to scroll, Lembke advised offloading tempting apps and powering your phone off between uses.\n\nOr if you’re feeling brave, you can take a page from Lembke, who leaves her house without her phone and keeps any necessary apps on her laptop, “so that it’s not quite so accessible and quite so mobile”.\n\nLembke advised turning on “grayscale” mode in your phone’s display settings, which “is a good way to make it less potent”. And if you’re worried that you won’t remember how to switch it back to color, Price has shared how to create an accessibility shortcut that allows you to easily toggle between the two modes.\n\nYou can also try decreasing your algorithm’s power. If you often fall down YouTube rabbit holes, turn off its “recommendations” feature. That way, you have to manually search for every new video, Lembke said.\n\nIf you need a physical reminder of why you’d like to make a change to your screen time, Price advises you to write a “breakup” letter to your phone.\n\n“Truly think about your phone as a partner in a relationship. What do you love about it, but what’s not working? How has it helped you? How is it hurting you?” Price said.\n\nMany of the experts advised taking planned time away from your phone.\n\nDr Larry Rosen, co-author of The Distracted Mind and a research psychologist, recommended “tech breaks”, consisting of two minutes of screen time, followed by 15 to 30 minutes of focused, distraction-free work. “Then you’re controlling the break,” he said.\n\nIf you’re up for a challenge, you can also try taking an extended break. “You do feel better,” Lembke said. It also forces you to connect with people in your life. “In the face of boredom and discomfort, people typically reach out to other people.”\n\nIf you don’t want to go without a smartphone completely, try swapping with a loved one.\n\nOn the weekends, Etkin, the Duke professor, trades phones with her partner. “That way we can get a hold of each other if we need to, and we could check something if we need to. But we can’t be on our own media streams,” she said.\n\nLooking for more tips? Consider subscribing to the Guardian’s Reclaim your brain newsletter for more ways to reduce your screen time in 2026.\n\nRecently, I’ve been trying a whole slew of hobbies to replace scrolling on TikTok. A few of my favorites are watercoloring and reading on my Kindle. And despite the chilly weather, I love going for a run. I also asked my Filter colleagues about screen-free things they liked to do, and here’s what they said.\n\nNick Mokey, Filter editor: Now that I work from home, I actually miss the days of commuting into an office by bike every day, and I find myself inventing excuses to run errands on two wheels: buying groceries, getting a haircut, meeting friends for a beer.\n\nI’ve never arrived anywhere in a worse mood after biking there, and when I catch clear skies in the winter, a bike commute can become the highlight of an otherwise mundane day. With both no screen and no earbuds for safety, it’s a total disconnect from all things digital.\n\nKaren Yuan, Filter US commissioning editor: Is it a cop-out to say my favorite screen-free activity is taking a walk? Especially very long walks.\n\nA couple years ago, I fell in love with solo backpacking, and since then I’ve hiked through forests and dirt roads in Spain, France and Japan with my trusty Osprey Mira 32L. I love taking these walking tours of new places because they force me to just take in and enjoy what’s around me.\n\nAnd because I can’t always up and leave my everyday life, I try to keep that mindset at home, too – by taking long evening walks around my Brooklyn neighborhood that help me view all my familiar sights anew.",

A 0→1 builder who doesn’t just ideate, but ships. You’ll create great content, run scrappy experiments, and build product growth loops that compound. This is a hands-on role: you’ll set strategy, execute a rapid experiment cadence, measure results, and turn wins into repeatable playbooks.\n\nYou’ll focus primarily on non-advertising channels: organic social, influencer/creator collaborations, channel partners, and product growth loops. We value strong taste, speed, and a rigorous learning cadence.\n\nYou’ll report directly to the CEO and work closely with Product, Engineering, Design, Partnerships, and Sales. You’re likely a good fit if you’re excited to open Adobe/Figma/Notion/PostHog and ship something today.\n\nSend us your first out-of-the-box idea for your first campaign in this role. Bonus points for mentioning other companies and campaigns you think are relevant.\n\nOur founders met while building competing consumer startups. We launched multiple products across consumer and SaaS and talked to thousands of fans and creators in the process. In 2020, we realized one of the biggest pain points artists and events face is actually driving their audience from socials into their own CRM.\n\nIn 2020, we joined Y Combinator’s summer batch and began building a product that quickly gained strong early traction. We raised from top-tier investors like Eldridge and Sony and have since grown into a team of 24 exceptional individuals spanning product, sales, and operations.\n\nWe have a strong written documentation culture. We try to do as much as possible asynchronously to move quickly and efficiently. We have a daily 30 minute standup and team-specific meetings throughout the week.",

    "fullText": "As Venezuelans attempt to regain a semblance of normalcy after the US capture of President Nicolás Maduro, authorities in the country are cracking down on any show of support to the beleaguered leader’s removal.\n\nAs Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as Venezuela’s acting leader on Monday, rights group warned of escalating repression, with checkpoints being erected around the country, amid reports of price gouging and growing hunger.\n\nOfficials imposed a decree on Monday, which grants broad powers to the presidency and orders security forces to capture “any person involved in the promotion or support” of the weekend attack by the US.\n\nThat same day, Venezuelan security forces temporarily detained 14 journalists, including reporters who were covering the swearing-in of the country’s national assembly, according to the national press union. No explanation was given for their detention.\n\nIt also emerged that political prisoners had their visiting rights suspended and are being prevented from communicating with the outside world, according to the Committee for the Liberation of Political Prisoners in Venezuela.\n\nThe committee added that checkpoints have been going up in cities around the country, with people being searched and detained for possessing “digital material” linked to the US military action.\n\nVenezuela’s Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello posted two videos on Instagram showing security forces in the capital. In one video, a group of armed men can be heard shouting: “Loyal always, traitors never!”\n\nSilence and anxiety grip the capital Caracas, caused by the shock of the January 3 attack and the fear of the government’s heavy-handed response.\n\nThere is still a heavy police presence in Caracas, even if there are fewer soldiers patrolling the streets.\n\nThere has been little sign of public dissent or even anti-government posts on social media. The fear of reprisal looms large under a regime notorious for punishing dissent, especially given the officials in charge of past crackdowns, Cabello and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López, remain in their roles.\n\nSince Sunday, pro-government groups have taken to the streets to demand the release of Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores. But these types of demonstrations have been limited in size and scope.\n\nEven in the face of uncertainty, Venezuelans seem ready to move forward.\n\nMore civilians were seen milling out on the streets of Caracas today. Public offices are operating, the Metro is running, the nearby airport is receiving domestic flights, and supermarkets are still selling produce to customers.\n\nSome services are not yet operating at full capacity, due in part to a public holiday, Día de los Reyes (Three Kings’ Day), which has kept many at home.\n\nBut over the next few days, schools are due to reopen, and employees are expected to report back to work full-time. Padrino López told people Sunday to “resume their economic activities, work, and all other types of activities, including educational activities, in the coming days.”\n\nThe government’s focus seems to be shifting toward restarting the economy, which has been flashing warning signs this week.\n\nVenezuela’s currency, the Bolívar, has suffered a sharp devaluation. Yesterday, there were areas in the city of Maracaibo where stores and shops only accepted cash, and the exchange rate was 900 to 1,000 Bolívares to the US dollar (it is normally around 300).\n\nAmid reports of price gouging, some shelves across the country have started to empty.\n\nReports of hunger are relentless in areas farther from the city. In the east of the country, businesses in smaller cities have removed prices altogether.\n\nThe challenges plaguing the country are abundant. But Venezuelans, having endured years of crises, know how to tackle adversity.\n\nCaracas merchant Douglas Sanchez told Reuters Monday that in the midst of the chaos and desperation, “those of us who work day to day, who eat day to day” have to keep making money. “Because if you don’t go out to work, you don’t have anything.”\n\nCNN’s Jack Guy, Gonzalo Zegarra and Germán Padinger contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "An El Paso high school graduate was remembered for having the \"kindest soul, a beautiful smile, and a heart that cared deeply for everyone\" after she was killed by a driver who allegedly ran a red light, marking El Paso's first traffic-related death of 2026.\n\nAngelique Diaz De Leon, 18, died as she was a passenger in a 2013 Chevrolet Camaro that was hit by a 2023 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck about 2 a.m. on Thursday, Jan.1, on Gateway North Boulevard and Sean Haggerty Drive in the Northeast, El Paso Police Department spokesman Officer Adrian Cisneros said in a news release.\n\nOfficers responding to a two-vehicle crash found Diaz De Leon dead at the scene. An investigation revealed the Silverado driven by 48-year-old Abel Garcia of Chaparral, New Mexico, allegedly failed to stop at a red light and t-boned the Camaro, the news release states.\n\n\"On January 1, 2026, our family lost a piece of our hearts,\" her family wrote on a GoFundMe page. \"Our beautiful Angelique was taken from us far too soon and our world will never be the same without her.\n\n\"Angelique is pure love. She had the kindest soul, a beautiful smile, and a heart that cared deeply for everyone around her. She was smart beyond her years, funny without even trying, and never held anger in her heart. She always helped us, always showed up, and always gave more love than she ever asked for in return.\"\n\nNicholas Jasay Ramirez, 19, of Chaparral, was driving the Camaro and suffered minor injuries. He was taken to a hospital for treatment.\n\nEl Paso police investigators determined that Garcia's failure to stop at the red light was the contributing factor to the wreck. Alcohol is also suspected as a contributing factor, police said, but no further information was released on whether Garcia is facing criminal charges. He is not listed in jail records as of Tuesday, Jan. 6.\n\nEl Paso Independent School District's Transmountain Early College High School officials posted a statement on their website stating Diaz De Leon \"was traveling home when an intoxicated driver collided with the vehicle she was in.\"\n\nDiaz De Leon graduated as part of the early college's Spring class of 2025.\n\n\"Angelique joined TMECHS after applying in the Fall of 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" the statement said. \"She returned to campus at a time filled with uncertainty and became part of the first group of students to attend the in-person Summer Bridge program in Summer 2021. From the beginning, she showed determination, focus, and resilience as she worked toward earning both her high school diploma and an Associate of Science degree.\"\n\nMore: 1 person dies in El Paso's first reported fatal crash of 2026\n\nShe was remembered as a hard worker who was always helping her fellow students.\n\n\"Angelique carried a strong work ethic throughout her years at TMECHS,\" the statement said. \"She supported her peers, stepped up when others needed help, and treated those around her with care and respect. Students and staff knew her as dependable, kind, and uplifting. She brought light to our campus.\n\n\"She embraced the academic rigor of the early college program. Angelique completed four years of high school coursework while taking college classes at El Paso Community College. In Spring 2025, she graduated from both EPCC and TMECHS, earning her associate degree and high school diploma.\"\n\nDiaz De Leon enrolled at Pima Medical Institute, where she planned to pursue a career in occupational therapy, the statement said.\n\n\"We honor Angelique,\" the statement ends. \"We remember her. She will always be a Maverick.\"\n\nAaron Martinez covers the criminal justice system for the El Paso Times.

    "fullText": "Jan 6 (Reuters) - The 92-year-old judge overseeing the Nicolas Maduro case has said he displays a Hebrew scripture from the Torah on the wall of his Manhattan chambers: “Tzedek, tzedek tirdof” — “Justice, justice you shall pursue.\"\n\nAn Orthodox Jew who has been ​on the bench for almost three decades, U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein has been outspoken about how he tries to promote fairness ‌and the impact of his faith on his judicial philosophy.\n\nHellerstein opened the court hearing on Monday by saying he wants a fair trial for the ousted Venezuelan leader, who pleaded not ‌guilty on Monday to narco-terrorism charges.\n\n\"That's my job, and that's my intent,\" Hellerstein said.\n\nON THE SEVENTH DAY HE CONTEMPLATES\n\nHellerstein said in a 2020 podcast that he schedules sentencing hearings for Fridays, so that he can spend Shabbat — the Jewish sabbath from Friday sunset to Saturday nightfall — reflecting on whether the prison sentence he handed down was appropriate.\n\nHellerstein has ruled against President Donald Trump in recent years. He has also spoken up when he believes lawyers are not ⁠best serving their clients.\n\nIn a 2013 law review article, ‌he wrote that some lawyers were \"outraged\" and accused him of \"arrogation of power\" when he rejected a $675 million settlement negotiated between New York City and injured first responders who raced to the World Trade Center after the attacks of ‍September 11, 2001.\n\nHellerstein concluded that, while no statute or rule clearly addressed whether the deal needed his blessing, he had inherent authority to reject it as inadequate.\n\nThe attorneys ended up presenting Hellerstein with a new settlement that added $125 million for victims.\n\nHellerstein \"is a man of strongly held convictions and he seeks to find a way to harmonize ​the law with his understanding of justice,\" said Mitchell Epner, a former federal prosecutor who has observed Hellerstein on the bench.\n\nHellerstein has spoken ‌candidly about how his Jewish values affect his decision-making.\n\n\"As a judge, and as a Jew, I consider that everything I do reflects God and affects His image,\" he wrote in the 2013 article.\n\nIn the 2020 podcast, Hellerstein said he believes he was \"the first Orthodox boy employed by a gentile or Jewish firm in New York City.\"\n\n\"I'm pleased to say that after me there were others, and some credited me with having broken the precedent,\" Hellerstein said.\n\nHellerstein already had a long career before President Bill Clinton nominated him to the federal bench in 1998.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1960, Hellerstein served in the ⁠Judge Advocate General's Corps, the legal arm of the United States Army.\n\nIn 1960, Hellerstein ​joined the now-defunct firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, where he ended up practicing for much ​of his career.\n\nA HISTORY OF REBUKING TRUMP'S LEGAL GAMBITS\n\nIn a high-profile case in 2020, Hellerstein ordered the release of former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen, after Trump's Justice Department tried to revoke his home confinement and return him to jail.\n\nHellerstein ‍concluded Trump's administration was retaliating against Cohen ⁠for writing a book.\n\nIn 2023, Hellerstein denied a request by Trump to move to federal court his New York criminal case relating to a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Trump was tried in state court and found guilty of 34 felony ⁠counts.\n\nIn May 2025, Hellerstein rejected an effort by the Trump administration to use a wartime law to send alleged gang members to Venezuela, saying the men had been improperly denied ‌their day in court.\n\n“This is the United States of America,\" he said. \"People are being thrown out of the country because of ‌their tattoos.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Republicans must win the 2026 midterm elections or else he will get impeached by Democrats.\n\n\"You gotta win the midterms 'cause, if we don't win the midterms, it's just gonna be - I mean, they'll find a reason to impeach me,\" Trump said at a retreat for House Republican lawmakers in Washington. \"I'll get impeached.\"\n\nThe president urged his fellow Republicans to fight in a more unified fashion on issues ranging from gender politics to healthcare and election reforms, and to sell his policies to a public angry about cost of living issues.\n\nTrump's agenda is on the line in November's elections, when all the seats in the House of Representatives and a third of the Senate's seats will be contested.\n\nDuring the speech, Trump predicted an epic win for Republicans in the elections but also expressed concerns about historical precedent that the party of the sitting president usually fares poorly.\n\n\"They say that when you win the presidency, you lose the midterm,\" Trump said at the Kennedy Center, a Washington performing arts center that was recently renamed to include a mention of Trump. \"I wish you could explain to me what the hell's going on with the mind of the public,\" Trump said.\n\nHouse Republicans have shown enormous deference to Trump so far, ceding much of Congress' authority over spending and other matters to his administration. But they have started to show glimmers of independence. The House could vote this week to override a veto Trump issued last month that canceled water projects in Colorado and Utah, though it is not clear whether the effort will get the two-thirds majority needed.\n\nTrump was impeached twice by the Democratic-led House of Representatives during his 2017-2021 term in office, faulting him for what they said were abuses of power involving Ukraine and ahead of the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. The Republican-controlled Senate voted to acquit him in both cases.\n\nReporting by Steve Holland, Trevor Hunnicutt, Bo Erickson, Andy Sullivan and Richard Cowan, Editing by Franklin Paul and Alistair Bell",

    "fullText": "It's only been days since an audacious U.S. raid snatched Nicolás Maduro from a Venezuelan military base and sped him to a Brooklyn prison, yet Detroit-area Trump supporter Aaron Tobin can already see it all playing out on the big screen.\n\nIt'll be the subject of movies for years to come, he predicts. “I am thrilled.” Plenty of others who voted for President Donald Trump and spoke to The Associated Press about the raid are applauding, too — at least for now.\n\nThe seizure of Venezuela's authoritarian leader and his wife has forced another reckoning on the “Make America Great Again” coalition, already rocked by the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files and strained by rising health insurance premiums and living costs.\n\nTrump promised his voters that “America First” would stand against more foreign entanglements. Instead, he intervened with force and without congressional approval in a new frontier, a South American capital so far from Washington that Google Maps says it “can't seem to find a way there.”\n\nThe geopolitical action film that Tobin sees in his mind is only at its opening scene, before all the complexities of uprooting a foreign government by a U.S. president's fiat come rushing in. U.S. forces entered and exited swiftly. But what happens next?\n\nTrump finds early but not endless support\n\nEarly on, the pushback from congressional Republicans and Trump's core constituencies has been guarded, in contrast to their uproar over the Epstein episode or the tensions coursing through Republican politics over the now-expired health insurance subsidies.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Trump voters interviewed by AP journalists around the country praised the operation and expressed faith in Trump's course. But not always limitless faith. They did not all back up Trump's claim that those who “voted for me are thrilled. They said, ‘This is what we voted for.’”\n\n“I support him so far,” Paul Bonner, 67, told AP while browsing at a Trump merchandise store in Bensalem, Pennsylvania. “Until he messes up, I support him.”\n\nTrump's apparent willingness to stay involved in Venezuela and his intensifying rhetoric about expanding U.S. power elsewhere in the hemisphere are making some of his die-hard supporters nervous.\n\nNot all of them are reaching for the popcorn yet.\n\nIn Mississippi, a conflicted Trump voter\n\nChase Lewis, 24, of Philadelphia, Mississippi, said the move caught him off guard and he still isn’t sure whether he supports it. “It’s good that they’re finally freed from that dictatorship,” he said of Venezuelans, “but I don’t know what it’s going to cost us.”\n\nHe added: “I don’t want my friends that are serving right now to be dragged into a war because we went and stuck our nose in Venezuela’s business.” He noted that Trump had campaigned against starting new wars. “Depending on how you look at it,” he said, “this was an act of war.”\n\nAn electrician apprentice who gave up his delivery job because he needed to make more money, Lewis said he wants to see the Trump administration focus on bringing down costs for young people like himself. He also wants the president to make life better for veterans and worries about plunging the country into more conflicts.\n\nIn Colorado, cheers and caution from Trump voters\n\nTo Trump voter Travis Garcia, leaning against his red pickup truck on a chilly evening in Castle Rock, Colorado, it’s a slam-dunk. “Of course I’m going to be happy that they captured a dictator that’s constantly sending drugs our way,” he said, “If we’re not gonna do it, who’s gonna do it?”\n\nThe 45-year-old, who works in remodeling, said the operation reinforces Trump's stature as “a powerful man who follows through on his word and isn’t going to be shy and timid and let other countries run the rules.”\n\nMary Lussier, 48, a flight attendant from the town of Larkspur, was so amazed by the success of the mission in Venezuela that she would be OK with more such operations. She recalled videos of Venezuelans tearfully celebrating Maduro's removal and said fewer bad leaders “would make the world a little bit lesser of a bad place.”\n\nStill, Lussier wouldn’t want U.S. soldiers stuck in a prolonged conflict, and much of her admiration for the operation hinged less on the possible benefits to the U.S. than on the smooth efficiency and bravado of the raiders.\n\nOutside a Safeway grocery store in Castle Rock, Patrick McCans, 66, said delicately that Trump's intervention was “a little contrary to what he campaigned on.”\n\n“I would like to see more of a diplomatic way of making change,” said the retired engineer. Still, he said, pondering for a moment, “I think in this case it might have been warranted.”\n\nInstead of playing ball, Maduro was “playing chicken with Trump, and Trump doesn’t like chicken,” he said, chuckling from beneath a Baltimore Ravens baseball cap.\n\nThe Colorado Trump supporters interviewed by AP all applauded the military operation’s smoothness and “class,” as one described it. But that support could waver if the U.S. is drawn into a longer conflict, which none of them would support.\n\nFew mentioned Trump’s plans for Venezuela’s oil, but thought Maduro's removal would benefit citizens and slow the drug trade and immigration to the U.S.\n\nFrom Pennsylvania: Good riddance to Maduro\n\nAt the Golden Dawn Diner in Levittown, Pennsylvania, Ron Soto, 88, expressed unreserved faith in the president's ability to manage what comes next. The retired tractor-trailer driver regularly visits the diner to meet friends, drink coffee and catch up.\n\nMaduro is an “awful man,” he said. But should U.S. forces go into other countries, like Cuba, as it did in Venezuela? “I don’t think they’ll have to,” he said. “Because he (Trump) put the fear in them.”\n\nAs for Trump's comment at one point that his administration would “run” Venezuela, Soto said the president will “straighten that country out and make it into a democracy if he can. I don’t know if he can.”\n\nAt the Neshaminy Mall, in Bensalem, retired firefighter Kevin Carey, 62, pronounced himself supportive of what Trump did but aware of the risks.\n\n“I wouldn’t say thrilled but I’m cautiously optimistic,” he said. Carey recalled the seizing of U.S. hostages by Iranian revolutionaries in 1979 as an indication of what might happen if the conflict escalates. But “he'll take all actions to avoid that, I believe,” he said of Trump.\n\nOn any further foreign intervention, Carey broke out laughing when he said: “He wants Greenland to be part of America!”\n\nAt the Trump merchandise store where Bonner shopped, banners and other items proclaiming “Trump 2028” are on display. Trump is constitutionally prohibited from running in 2028.\n\n“I know he can’t run for president” in 2028, said Bonner, a propane company worker. Still, he wanted a lawn sign “just to irritate people” but didn't find one.\n\nThe crisp military operation plainly left him impressed. “They got in and they got out, did what they had to do,” he said. Of Maduro, he said: “He’s an enemy of the United States so I support Trump 100%.”\n\nExiting a Walmart in Martinsville, Indiana, Mark Edward Miller, 75, from nearby Mooresville, said the only thing that surprised him about Trump's intervention was that word of it did not leak in advance. The consistent Trump voter was an aircraft maintenance specialist in the Air Force before his retirement.\n\n“I don’t feel like he’s actually taken over a country,” Miller said. “I believe that he’s doing exactly what our country should be doing — supporting, especially in our hemisphere, governments that are friendly with us” and challenging those that are hostile.\n\nTobin, the man in Michigan who sees a cinematic future for the raid, not only approved of the operation but wants more of them.\n\n“Especially if they were as successful as this last one where we didn’t lose any troops, we didn’t lose any planes or ships,” Tobin said during a visit to the Oakland County Republican Party headquarters, where he was surrounded by Trump and GOP memorabilia. “I am thrilled and surprised” by what happened.\n\n“Cuba’s very nervous right now,” he said. “And the Cuban people are suffering immensely from their horrible situation and their economy. Iran might be next.”\n\nThe three-time Trump voter is an active member of the local Republican Party, a certified firearms instructor and head of a bicycling group in his hometown of Oak Park, Michigan.\n\nHis takeaway: “President Trump does not speak idly. If he says he’s going to do something, he does something.”\n\nBedayn reported from Colorado, Catalini from Pennsylvania, Householder from Michigan, Bates from Mississippi, Lamy from Indiana and Woodward from Washington.",

    "description": "\"Can you imagine if a Pringles distributor paid full retail to Pringles and then sold to grocery stores for full retail, and then the grocery stores had to wait for a rebate?\"",
    "fullText": "Mark Cuban has an idea for how to stop the runaway train that is the $38 trillion national debt, and it has a lot to do with the online pharmacy company he founded in January 2022. On Christmas Eve, the billionaire investor posted on X about his frustrations with the insurance market.\n\nInsurers and providers, according to Cuban, “play on the fear and information asymmetry that exists in healthcare.” He advocated for them to be broken up, so as to “make the markets efficient again.”\n\nWhile Cuban’s proposal focused on $100 fines for insurers that over-bill or deny care, the broader thrust of his argument is dismantling opaque middlemen and forcing transparent pricing—as he does with his Cost Plus Drugs pharmacy—could help tame one of the biggest drivers of America’s fiscal strain.​\n\nAmerica’s national debt surged past $38 trillion in October, adding roughly $1 trillion in just over two months in 2025—twice the pace of typical growth since 2000, according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a leading fiscal watchdog. Annual interest payments are already around $1 trillion and could total as much as $14 trillion over the coming decade, a trajectory the watchdog warns is “no way for a great nation like America to run its finances.” A closer look at health insurance and over-billing doesn’t exactly find fixing the issue would fix the debt or deficit​, but Cuban is right that something is definitely off in this space.\n\nCost Plus Drugs sells medications at their manufacturing cost, plus a flat 15% markup, a small pharmacy fee, and a posted shipping charge. The company cuts out traditional pharmacy benefit managers and negotiates directly with manufacturers, publishing acquisition costs and formulas so customers can see exactly how their prices are built.​\n\nFortune and other outlets have reported Cost Plus Drugs can slash the price of some generics from thousands of dollars a month to double‑digit sums, especially for patients who are uninsured or stuck with high deductibles. Cuban argues if similar transparency and direct‑to‑consumer models were applied across health care—combined with rules like letting cash prices count toward insurance deductibles—the country could strip out layers of waste that burden both families and, ultimately, public budgets.",

    "fullText": "A South Carolina teenager reported missing late last year has been found safe, and a man has been arrested in the case, authorities said.\n\nThe Lexington County Sheriff’s Office said Mackenzie Dalton, 16, was found in Lexington County following an investigation into her disappearance.\n\nDeputies said there is no indication Dalton was ever held against her will or with someone she did not want to be with.\n\nDalton was reported missing after she was last seen leaving her home in late November, according to a Jan. 2 statement from the sheriff’s office. At the time, authorities said she was considered an endangered juvenile due to her age and the length of the time she had been gone.\n\nTeen Girl Vanishes From South Carolina Home; Police Fear She's In Serious Danger After Monthlong Search\n\nInvestigators previously said they believed Dalton may have been with a man she knew, although authorities did not release the man's identity.\n\nThe sheriff’s office said the vehicle Dalton drove away in and the suitcase she took from her home were recovered during the investigation. The teen was described as 5 feet, 4 inches tall and weighing 118 pounds.\n\nDeputies arrested Mackenzie Keith English Jr., 18, charging him with obstruction of justice, during their investigation.\n\nAuthorities accuse English of lying to investigators about being with Dalton and about his knowledge of her whereabouts.\n\nEnglish is being held at the Lexington County Detention Center, the sheriff’s office said.\n\nOriginal article",
