    "description": "Mayweather vs. Pacquiao 2 is the algorithm's dream and boxing's dilemma. But it's also just par for the course in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao are rematching.\n\nWhat? Did this story pass you by?!\n\nAfter various boxing media outlets teased “unbelievable news” on Monday morning, the frankly believable truth was unfurled later that day that the pair of rival quadragenarians are confirmed to be running it back on Sept. 19 inside Las Vegas’ Sphere. In fact, \"MayPac 2\" landing in 2026 made the fourth spot on our list of predictions for the calendar year. Nostradamus? Not-exactly-us.\n\nSince their first meeting in 2015 — when Mayweather secured a unanimous decision victory — the American bid farewell to the sport with a win over Andre Berto, only to return two years later to sweep aside Conor McGregor in what was, depending on your view, more spectacle than sport.\n\nPacquiao, meanwhile, pressed on after the Mayweather defeat, recording five wins from seven bouts before announcing his retirement in 2021. He later reversed that decision, returning to fight former WBC welterweight world champion Mario Barrios to a draw this past July.\n\nHere we stand in 2026. If their first bout came too long after its perfect moment had passed, what does that say about a sequel arriving more than a decade after their \"Fight of the Century\"?\n\nRetired boxers making comebacks is nothing new. Just ask George Foreman. Muhammad Ali. Mike Tyson. Sugar Ray Leonard. Tyson Fury — repeatedly. And plenty who haven’t that still publicly flirt with the idea. Just ask Joe Calzaghe. Wladimir Klitschko. Andre Ward. Carl Froch — repeatedly.\n\nNo matter how high you climb in boxing’s food chain, saying goodbye to the sport is often the toughest fight of all. Father Time, they say, remains undefeated — but that never stops boxers from challenging him.\n\nIf nothing else, Monday's news only further confirms the appetite for sugar-rush spectacles from new players in the market — in this case, Netflix. The global streaming giant will air the fight free to subscribers, marking the first time a Floyd Mayweather bout has appeared outside the traditional pay-per-view model since his 2005 welterweight clash with Sharmba Mitchell.\n\nIt’s a clear shift toward loud, algorithm-friendly, standalone, industry-disrupting events — the kind designed as much for global headlines and subscriber spikes as for sporting merit. And thus isolating and ignoring the future stars of the sport. Netflix aren’t serious about boxing or building a stable of fighters — why should they be when they can simply pick and choose their events?\n\nEclipsing the staggering $600 million Mayweather and Pacquiao generated in their first meeting is all but a pipe dream 11 years later. But that’s not to say that both men won’t be substantially compensated for their efforts this time around — after all, that’s being widely reported as the sole reason Mayweather has agreed to the 51st fight of his professional career. If there is a \"why\" asked in boxing, the answer is usually simple: Money.\n\nPacquiao won’t turn his nose up at a handsome payday either, but his motivations also lie in revenge against the man who defined years of his career.\n\nBut Mayweather and Pacquiao renewing their vows — in a bout few were truly calling for — sets off a different kind of alarm in a sport that should be straining toward its future, not recycling its past.\n\nBoxing speaks constantly about new eras: The next pound-for-pound king, the next crossover star, the next global face. But when push comes to shove, it still reaches over its own shoulder.\n\nFor boxing’s current generation, the task won’t simply be winning fights this summer — it will be fighting for oxygen while the sport fixates on a Netflix-funded nostalgia act.\n\nWhen the lights dim and the roar ricochets around the Sphere on Sept. 19, there’s no doubt hearts will flutter for a moment. The anticipation will feel rich and intoxicating — like the first bite of an indulgent dessert down the Vegas strip.\n\nBut just as quickly, it will be gone. A sugar rush without sustenance. No depth, no lasting nourishment — and before you know it, six months of breathless hype will dissolve like spun sugar in water, leaving little more than a fleeting aftertaste.",

    "fullText": "Juan Soto is coming for Shohei Ohtani’s MVP crown originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJuan Soto did not tiptoe into the MVP conversation.\n\nWhen asked about competing with Shohei Ohtani for National League MVP, Juan Soto did not hedge or deflect.\n\n“He better keep doing what he’s doing, because I’m coming.”\n\nThat is not offseason filler. That is a superstar publicly setting his target.\n\nOhtani has owned the award the past two seasons in the National League. He has the power numbers, the WAR totals, and now the return to full two-way duty looming. Soto knows all of that. He also knows the only way to beat a player like Ohtani is to put together a season so strong that voters have no choice but to think twice.\n\nOhtani’s offensive production last season was overwhelming.\n\nFifty-five home runs. A 172 wRC+. 7.5 WAR as a hitter alone.\n\nThat is MVP level before even factoring in what he could add on the mound in 2026.\n\nSoto’s stat line was excellent in its own right. Forty-three home runs. A 156 wRC+. 5.8 WAR.\n\nFor most players, that resume is more than enough to win an MVP.\n\nAgainst Ohtani, it finished second.\n\nThat gap is the reality Soto is addressing with his quote. He is not pretending the standard is low. He is acknowledging it and daring himself to meet it.\n\nIf you split Soto’s season in two, the path becomes clearer.\n\nThrough late May, he was solid but not dominant. The power was down. The overall impact was good, not overwhelming.\n\nFrom May 30 through the end of the year, Soto was one of the most productive players in baseball. He led the National League in WAR during that stretch. He hit 35 home runs. He stole 31 bases. His 179 wRC+ topped the league among qualified hitters.\n\nIf that version of Soto shows up from Opening Day forward, we are talking about a legitimate 45 to 50 home run season with elite on-base numbers and high-end run creation.\n\nThat is how you start closing the gap.\n\nOne of the biggest developments in Soto’s game last season was his running.\n\nHe tied for the league lead with 38 stolen bases and was caught only four times. That kind of efficiency changes games. It turns walks into doubles. It forces pitchers into mistakes.\n\nOhtani remains a threat on the bases, but if he is pitching regularly again, it is reasonable to expect his stolen base totals to level out.\n\nIf Soto pushes toward 40 steals again while maintaining elite power, his all around profile becomes impossible to ignore. A hitter who gets on base at a premium rate and then takes extra bases adds value in ways that traditional counting stats do not fully capture.\n\nSoto is not going to win the MVP on defense.\n\nBut he cannot lose it there either.\n\nThe defensive metrics have not always been kind, and that part of his game has been scrutinized. Improvement does not have to mean spectacular. It has to mean steady. It has to mean that his glove is not subtracting from what his bat and legs are adding.\n\nAgainst a player like Ohtani, every margin matters.\n\nMore: Braves lock up starting pitcher entering 17th season in MLB\n\nThe interesting part of Soto’s quote is not the bravado. It is the understanding behind it.\n\nHe knows Ohtani will produce. He knows the highlight moments will come. He knows voters are used to checking Ohtani’s name at the top of the ballot.\n\nSoto is not asking for a stumble.\n\nHe is saying he plans to raise his own level high enough to make it a real debate.\n\nIf he delivers 45 plus home runs, pushes toward 40 steals, posts a wRC+ in the 170 range and plays steady defense over 162 games, the conversation changes.\n\n“He better keep doing what he’s doing, because I’m coming.”\n\nIt is the mission statement for Soto’s 2026 season.\n\nCardinals pitcher gives up homer with the wrong baseball in his hand\n\nBraves lock up starting pitcher entering 17th season in MLB",

    "fullText": "The WNBA generated enough revenue in 2025 to trigger revenue sharing with players for the first time in league history.\n\nUnion leadership confirmed the milestone after the league notified players earlier this month that the required financial benchmark had been reached.\n\nUnder the current collective bargaining agreement, players are entitled to a share of revenue once predetermined thresholds are exceeded.\n\nThe 2020 CBA set revenue targets based on 2019 figures, increasing those benchmarks by 20 percent annually. Revenue losses during the pandemic-affected 2020 and 2021 seasons had previously made those targets appear difficult to reach.\n\nFor the first time, the league has now surpassed the threshold required to activate the revenue-sharing provision.\n\nAccording to the union, $16 million in shared revenue was generated. Of that total, $8 million will be distributed to players who were active during the 2025 season, while the remaining $8 million will be allocated to league marketing agreements.\n\nUnder the terms of the CBA, players receive 50% of shared revenue, defined as revenue above the threshold minus 30% for expenses. The union has 30 days to submit its proposed distribution plan, and payments are due within 60 days of the league issuing its report.\n\nUnion leaders have pointed to the milestone as proof of the league’s financial growth and the players’ expanding value.\n\n“This shows our value and how what we’re fighting for makes sense and how we should keep fighting,” WNBPA treasurer Brianna Turner said.\n\nIn addition, $9.25 million in licensing revenue generated since 2020 is set to be distributed among more than 250 current and former players, with payments based on years played between 2020 and 2025. The union reported that group licensing revenue exceeded $10 million in 2025 alone.\n\nThe 2026 season is scheduled to begin May 8, though a finalized CBA must be agreed upon before then. As negotiations move forward, the revenue-sharing milestone stands as a landmark financial achievement for the league and its players.\n\nKevin Durant can’t choose between Stephen Curry and Russell Westbrook as his best NBA teammate\n\nLeBron James hints his relationship with Jaylen Brown suffered after Bronny James comments\n\nJayson Tatum’s new Amica Insurance ad teases his return to Boston Celtics team after Achilles injury",

    "description": "Lions GM Brad Holmes addressed David Montgomery’s future during his 2026 NFL Scouting Combine press conference amid speculation following his reduced role in 2025.",
    "fullText": "David Montgomery’s future with the Detroit Lions remains one of the quieter but more intriguing storylines of the 2026 offseason.\n\nAfter a 2025 campaign that featured a noticeable reduction in touches, questions began to surface about where Montgomery fits moving forward, especially as Jahmyr Gibbs continued to emerge as one of the NFL’s most dynamic offensive weapons. While Montgomery remained effective when called upon, Detroit’s offensive identity shifted, and that shift inevitably fueled speculation about a potential separation.\n\nOn Tuesday at the 2026 NFL Scouting Combine, Lions general manager Brad Holmes addressed the situation directly.\n\nHolmes made it clear that lines of communication between the Lions and Montgomery’s camp are open and active.\n\n“I’ve been in touch with David’s agent and his representation, and, obviously we love David,” Holmes said. “He’s a great player and we’d love to have him.”\n\nThat statement alone reinforces how highly Montgomery is still regarded inside the organization. His physical running style, professionalism, and leadership have been integral to Detroit’s rise over the past two seasons, even if his role shifted statistically in 2025.\n\nMontgomery’s dip in touches wasn’t about decline, it was about evolution.\n\nWith Gibbs demanding more usage and the Lions leaning heavily into a high-powered passing attack, Detroit prioritized efficiency over volume at running back. Montgomery still handled key short-yardage situations, pass protection duties, and physical late-game carries, but the offense no longer revolved around a traditional workhorse approach.\n\nThat change, however, naturally raised questions about long-term fit.\n\nHolmes acknowledged that both sides must want the same future for a return to make sense.\n\n“We kinda want to put last year in the rear view and move forward, but a player has to want to be at a certain place as well,” Holmes said. “So, those conversations are still fluid.”\n\nThat comment is telling. Detroit appears open to resetting expectations and redefining Montgomery’s role, but the final decision may hinge on whether Montgomery is comfortable with that vision as he enters the next phase of his career.\n\nWith free agency approaching and multiple roster decisions looming, the Lions want clarity without forcing an outcome. Holmes’ comments suggested patience, respect, and realism, three traits that have defined Detroit’s front office under his leadership.\n\nFor now, Montgomery’s future remains unresolved, but the door is clearly not closed. Whether that door stays open will depend on alignment, opportunity, and timing as the Lions continue shaping a roster built to contend in 2026 and beyond.\n\nThe post Brad Holmes Addresses David Montgomery’s Future With Detroit Lions appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

I have a life outside of football that’s very easy for me to slip back into and act as a distraction.\n\n“I don’t know if it’s because of the success I had with club and country over the summer but I was really motivated.\n\n“Sometimes when you get injured you kind of want to remove yourself, it’s easier for you that way because the most important thing is your recovery.\n\n“But this time I was quite present and felt like I had the capacity to do (that), and I’m glad I did it because it’s a lot easier to come back into the fold and be ready at the same level as your team-mates.”\n\nStay up to date with all the latest women’s football news by joining our WhatsApp channel.\n\nWilliamson has twice won the Euros with England, in 2022 and then 2025, but says she hopes she is not done yet.\n\n“After 2022 I know it had fuelled a fire, I suppose, to go and win again,” she explained.\n\n“To have gone and done that, I feel like this time it took a lot out of all of us.\n\n“I didn’t want to be injured but I suppose it provided me with time physically and mentally to reset and process it properly.\n\n“It’s quite a hard thing for an athlete.

    "fullText": "Floyd Mayweather, 49, and Manny Pacquiao, 47, will contest their rematch in a professional bout in Las Vegas on 19 September.\n\nIt is a weird fight, \"a carnival\" as Steve Bunce aptly puts it. It is not one that boxing fans have been clamouring for. Nor were they ever considering how the first fight went in 2015 – delivered five years too late and as stale as feared.\n\n\"Carnival\" boxing events, however, have become Netflix's trademark. The streaming platform values one-off, big impact fights that may have little shelf life but burn bright in the moment.\n\n\"It's not the first carnival fight on Netflix,\" 5 Live Boxing expert Bunce told 5 Live Breakfast.\n\n\"We've had Mike Tyson against Jake Paul. We've had Jake Paul against Anthony Joshua.\n\n\"We're so far down the freak fight road that this one doesn't actually raise any alarms bells.\n\n\"It'll just be two men, way past their best in a legitimate fight that is nothing more than an ego-driven sparring session.\n\n\"This circus just gets deeper and deeper and deeper.\"\n\n'White humiliated Aspinall' - Hearn warns Benn after exit\n\nBoxing has a long history of carefully constructed mismatches. Mayweather championed and perfected the genre, fighting UFC star Conor McGregor in a competitively pointless but massively lucrative bout in 2017.\n\nMcGregor was a novice and Mayweather carried him through ten rounds before bringing an end to the contest.\n\nNormally, exhibitions and \"freak fights\" were confined to the top of some luxury building with the wealthy paying a massive fee to see their favourite boxer up close.\n\nThe great Muhammad Ali reaped the benefit of this custom, fighting Japanese wrestler Antonio Inoki in 1976 in front of 14,00 in Tokyo.\n\nIrish boxer Mick Conlan believes money will be the driving factor for both men.\n\n\"They are two of the greatest of their generation but they are very old and must need money or this fight wouldn't be happening,\" he tells BBC Sport Northern Ireland.\n\nThis is the sell, an anything can happen event where anything is definitely not going to happen.\n\nMayweather brought this tradition to the big stage when he fought McGregor on pay-per-view at the T-Mobile Arena and people have been following his example ever since.\n\nWith Jake Paul turning the art into the biggest industry in boxing with Netflix in recent years, it is perhaps no surprise Mayweather has returned to get in on the act.\n\nBut unlike many of these weird and worrying events - see Paul v 58-year-old Mike Tyson - this contest seems at least from a health point of view, easy to digest.\n\n\"They are both similarly aged,\" Bunce says.\n\n\"One's 49, one's 47. They've had similar amount of fights.\n\n\"In theory, that's a good thing. They are equal in decay or decline. So they're not going in with a young dangerous fighter.\"\n\nIt is yet to be confirmed what exactly the rules will be, but the rematch will be a professional bout and count to each man's record.\n\nPacquiao has been in and out of the ring professionally and in exhibitions for years.\n\nHe was the oldest welterweight champion at the age of 40 in 2019 and came close to making it aged 46 when he drew with WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios in the summer of 2024.\n\nMayweather has not fought professionally since becoming 50-0 by beating McGregor in 2017, but he has competed in eight exhibition bouts since then, including against YouTuber and WWE star Logan Paul.\n\nBoth men will be subject to extra tests as they are over the age of 40, but neither will be expected to fail.\n\n\"The claims are that this will be a real fight,\" Bunce adds.\n\n\"They'll wear 10oz gloves, 12, three-minute rounds and there will be no special rules – allegedly.\"\n\n\"[In boxing] we either have exhibition fights or a real fight. This one is a blend of the two.\"\n\nDespite the fact a fight between two boxers nearing 50 is unlikely to set the sporting world alight, the competitive aspect seems secondary to the product.\n\n\"[The first fight] generated unbelievable sums of money. The gate itself, the tickets, generated $72m,\" Bunce says. \"[But] it was a dreadful fight. It was a stinker.\"\n\nMayweather, however, is a master promoter, Pacquiao is loved by millions – the build-up will be as much the offering as the fight night.\n\nNetflix has over 200m households globally and the bout will take place at the Sphere in Las Vegas which can hold 20,000.\n\nAfter what the UFC achieved visually with their event there in 2024, it could be a completely new kind of viewing experience for a boxing fight.\n\nNetflix has offered a fresh approach to fights, blending a big-show American style broadcasting with big-name expert analysts and presenters and drawing in the entertaiment world.\n\nAnd these are two legends of the sport reviving one of boxing's most famous rivalries of the last 50 years.\n\nThe appetite, as proven by Paul and Netflix's past success, is absolutely there.\n\n\"You wll naturally watch it,\" Bunce says and Conlan agrees.\n\n\"It's unwanted but then people will think, 'it's Pacquiao v Mayweather - of course I will watch',\" Conlan says.\n\n\"I would love Pacquiao to win,\" he adds.\n\n\"If he did, they'll probably do another one.\"\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Victor Osimhen gives an update on his knee injury and warns Galatasaray will ‘take the fight’ to Juventus despite their 5-2 Champions League play-off advantage. ‘Defence starts from the attack.’\n\nIt kicks off on Wednesday at the Allianz Juventus Stadium in Turin at 20.00 GMT (21.00 CET).\n\nThe Bianconeri have a mountain to climb after losing the first leg 5-2 in Istanbul, despite having taken a 2-1 lead going into half-time, as the Juan Cabal red card proved disastrous.\n\nOsimhen did not score in that first leg, but he rested over the weekend due to a knee issue.\n\nISTANBUL, TURKEY – SEPTEMBER 14: Victor Osimhen of Galatasaray looks on during the Turkish Super League match between Galatasaray and Rizespor at Rams Park Stadium on September 14, 2024 in Istanbul, Turkey. (Photo by Ahmad Mora/Getty Images)\n\n“My knee is fine, thank you,” Osimhen told Sky Sport Italia.\n\n“I have a little pain in my knee, that is the reason why I didn’t play the last league game, but thanks to the medical team, I am back with the squad and looking forward to facing Juve.”\n\nGalatasaray are aiming to make history by eliminating Juventus from the Champions League, and Osimhen denies suggestions they are a completely different team in his absence.\n\n“It’s a huge responsibility, but it’s not just about Osimhen. I have to give props to the rest of the squad, as they’ve been really been helpful putting this club where it should be,” continued the Nigeria international.\n\n“This club is huge, we’ve seen multiple times that even with legends in the past who played for this club, it is the only Turkish side that has done really well in Europe. We’ve been doing that for so many years, when you mention a big club, we’ve done so well in the Champions League.\n\n“We also have the opportunity tomorrow to write history for the club, so it’s not just about one player. Of course, I appreciate all the support from the fans, the coach, the confidence he has in me. If I don’t have these guys around my back, I don’t think they can listen to me when I try to charge them forward. Everything can be made possible, kudos to them, we’re going to lead each other hand in hand and try to make sure we get the maximum result.”\n\nISTANBUL, TURKEY – NOVEMBER 7: Victor Osimhen of Galatasaray celebrates victory during the UEFA Europa League 2024/25 League Phase MD4 match between Galatasaray A.S. and Tottenham Hotspur at Rams Park on November 7, 2024 in Istanbul, Turkey. (Photo by Ahmad Mora/Getty Images)\n\nAlthough he did not score in the first leg, his high pressing game saw him steal the ball twice and provide assists, constantly harassing the Juventus defenders.\n\n“One thing about me is if I’m not seeing an opportunity to score, I am trying to help my team,” added Osimhen.\n\n“Juventus always start from the back, so t was important to press them, I try to call my teammates forward too, so we don’t let them start that play from behind. Juventus have a lot of quality, when they manage to get the ball to Kenan Yildiz, he’s a very dangerous player, so is Conceicao, so we must try to block their passes.\n\n“Defence starts from the attack, so me and the other forwards have to start the press. It was just the right thing to do, and of course the instructions from the coach. I did my duty and I’m glad I did it diligently.”\n\nISTANBUL, TURKEY – FEBRUARY 17: Gabriel Sara of Galatasaray A.S. celebrates scoring his team’s first goal with teammates during the UEFA Champions League 2025/26 League Knockout Play-off First Leg match between Galatasaray A.S. and Juventus at Ali Sami Yen Spor Kompleksi on February 17, 2026 in Istanbul, Turkey. (Photo by Burak Kara/Getty Images)\n\nDespite such a big advantage from the first leg, Galatasaray and Osimhen have no intention of sitting back in Turin.\n\n“Tomorrow too I don’t think we’re the kind of squad who is going to lie back, because Juventus are a really big team, but we’ll come out and take the fight to them. It’s going to be a really tough game, I’m looking forward to it.”",

    "fullText": "Viktor Gyokeres is closing in on a notable milestone, just two goals shy of matching Alexandre Lacazette’s debut-season tally for Arsenal back in 2017/18.\n\nLacazette scored 17 times during his first season in North London, while Gyokeres is already on 15 after his double against Spurs.\n\nThe Swede had his best game yet for Arsenal during the North London derby, scoring twice as the Gunners won 4-1 away to Tottenham.\n\nAndrea Berta was a strong advocate for signing Gyokeres last summer. While some of the early performances raised questions, it is hard to argue with the numbers he is putting up now.\n\nAccording to Squawka, Gyokeres is nearing a milestone that could put an end to much of the scepticism surrounding his signing.\n\nThe Swedish striker is now within touching distance of becoming Arsenal’s most prolific debut striker since 2018.\n\nWith plenty of games left in the season, Gyokeres needs just two more goals to match Lacazette’s total from that campaign, and he seems well on track to surpass it.\n\nThe Frenchman had a mixed spell at the Emirates, but 17 goals in his first season remains a solid benchmark.\n\nInterestingly, two more goals would also make Gyokeres the top-scoring striker under Mikel Arteta, overtaking Lacazette’s mark from 2020/21.\n\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored 15 goals in the 2020/21 campaign, a total matched by Kai Havertz last season, while Gabriel Jesus’ highest tally came in 2022/23, finding the net 11 times.\n\nGyokeres’ current tally also makes him Arsenal’s leading scorer across all competitions this term, four ahead of Gabriel Martinelli.\n\nEberechi Eze spoke after the Spurs match, highlighting how Gyokeres’ work ethic has become an inspiration around Arsenal.\n\nThe Swede’s finishing in training has been sharp for a while now, and his opening goal against Spurs looked exactly like what he has been showing at London Colney.\n\nThe 27-year-old set himself up well before drilling his shot past Guglielmo Vicario, putting Arsenal back in front.\n\nGyokeres is well-liked inside the club and there is no doubt his teammates are pleased to see him hitting form. With two goals against Spurs under his belt, the focus now shifts to building on that momentum.\n\nViktor Gyokeres clause could cost Arsenal extra €500k\n\nPiers Morgan makes bold Viktor Gyokeres claim after Arsenal’s 4-1 derby win over Spurs",

    "fullText": "INDIANAPOLIS, Feb. 23 (UPI) -- The Las Vegas Raiders expect to keep defensive end Maxx Crosby in 2026, general manager John Spytek told reporters at the NFL scouting combine Tuesday in Indianapolis.\n\nCrosby, who signed a three-year, $106.5 million contract extension with the Raiders in 2025, totaled 44.5 sacks over the last four seasons.\n\n\"Maxx is an elite player and I've been very upfront from the start when I got here that we're in the business of having really good players on the team, and we need a lot more of them,\" Spytek said at the Indianapolis Convention Center. \"It's hard to build a great team without elite players.\"\n\nCrosby, 28, joined the Raiders as a fourth-round pick in the 2019 NFL Draft. The five-time Pro Bowl selection led the NFL in tackles for a loss in 2022 and 2023. He logged a career-high 14.5 sacks in 2023 and 10 quarterback takedowns in 2025.\n\nSpytek said he maintains \"a great relationship\" with Crosby, including frequent phone calls and text message exchanges.\n\nHe said he is \"comfortable\" in his belief that Crosby wants to stay with the AFC West franchise, but would \"always listen\" to trade offers. He declined to answer in the affirmative when asked if Crosby was \"untradable.\"\n\n\"I learned a long time ago: always listen,\" Spytek said. \"I'm always listening.\"",

    "fullText": "In a rather concerning bit of development, L’Equipe reports that Real Madrid superstar is ‘highly doubtful’ for tomorrow’s UEFA Champions League clash against SL Benfica.\n\nReal Madrid take on the Portuguese giants tomorrow at the Santiago Bernabeu in the second leg of their Champions League knockout playoff tie.\n\nThe Spanish capital heavyweights are already without important players like Jude Bellingham, Eder Militao, and Rodrygo, while Dani Ceballos is also out injured.\n\nNow, it is being suggested that Mbappe’s involvement against Jose Mourinho’s side at the Bernabeu tomorrow is unclear.\n\nThe Frenchman is still dealing with the after-effects of his knee injury that he sustained back in December, with the report claiming that the France captain is still not back at 100% fitness.\n\nIn fact, it is further stated that the 27-year-old superstar was forced to stop training during today’s sessions due to the problem.\n\nStill not fully fit? (Photo by Jose Manuel Alvarez Rey/Getty Images)\n\nWith the pain from his knee injury still persisting, Real Madrid could decide to rest Mbappe tomorrow against Benfica, even though manager Alvaro Arbeloa insisted otherwise in his press conference.\n\n“He’s ready to play tomorrow, which is the most important thing right now. It’s been several weeks and everyone knows that, but I want to highlight his effort and commitment,” he said.\n\nWhile Real Madrid go into the game with a slender 1-0 advantage from the first leg, things will be anything but easy for them tomorrow. And, if Mbappe is unavailable, it will come as a huge blow for the hosts.\n\nThe Frenchman happens to be Real Madrid’s top goalscorer this season, but did put in a lacklustre performance against Osasuna last weekend, suggesting that he could do with a breather.",

    "fullText": "Juventus have added Alisson Becker to their list of summer targets as they look to strengthen in goal.\n\nWith several key figures from the Jurgen Klopp era already gone, Alisson could be the next to move on. Giorgi Mamardashvili was brought in last summer as his eventual replacement, though the Brazilian has remained first choice so far.\n\nMamardashvili’s role was always expected to grow over time, but that transition could be accelerated if Juventus decide to make a formal approach during the upcoming window.\n\nThese links are surfacing because of the poor displays by current Juventus stopper Michele Di Gregorio.\n\nA report from La Gazzetta Dello Sport claims he and Spurs keeper Vicario are the top choices, alongside AC Milan’s Mike Maignan.\n\nThe final decision will come down to their financial situation, with Alisson being seen as a more affordable option compared to some of the alternatives.\n\nThe report names two factors that could see negotiations ‘favour’ the Turin outfit.\n\nFirstly, that Liverpool already have their future starting goalkeeper at Anfield.\n\nSecondly, Alisson’s contract expires at the end of the season. There is an option to extend for a further year, but even then, a 12-month contract wouldn’t be enough to force Juve to break the bank.\n\nThere’s also another factor — a more personal one — that could tempt Alisson into making the move.\n\nAlisson spent time in Italy before establishing himself at Liverpool, and he has previous connections with the current Juventus manager.\n\nThe Brazilian was working under Spalletti during his early days at Roma, where he started to break into the first team.\n\nBack then, Alisson was behind Wojciech Szczesny in the pecking order but played a key role in cup competitions as Roma went on to win silverware.\n\nIt’s still unclear what Alisson wants for his future, but if he is considering a move away from Anfield, a switch to Juve would make sense given his background and ties within Italian football.\n\nHowever, Liverpool may see value in keeping him around. Despite the arrival of Mamardashvili, Alisson isn’t past it yet, and having both compete could benefit Slot’s squad depth.\n\nMan Utd sceptical over surprising links to Alexis Mac Allister\n\nDominik Szoboszlai Real Madrid buzz is no concern for Liverpool fans, says journalist\n\nFlorian Wirtz setback clarified as Liverpool strongly feel absence of £116m star",

This is the Norwegian's 3rd goal in this Champions League after those scored against PSV and Bodo/Glimt.\n\nIn the 36th minute, the equalizer comes from a corner: Tzolis takes the corner, Mechele extends the trajectory and Ordonez scores with a header from close range: it's 1-1 (and 4-4 overall). This is the 8th goal conceded from a set-piece in this Champions League: a negative record in Atletico's history in the Champions League.\n\nSoon after, Oblak saves an almost certain goal: another cross from Tzolis and Vetlesen heads with a sure shot but Atletico's goalkeeper saves with an open hand. A save that is worth 0.80 xGOT (8 times out of 10 it usually becomes a goal).\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence. You can read the original version in 🇮🇹 here.",

    "fullText": "Meta hasn't only got eyes for Nvidia — it just signed a big chip deal with AMD.\n\nThe social network giant has agreed to purchase 6 gigawatts' worth of AMD's artificial intelligence chips, the companies said on Tuesday.\n\nMeta, which last week doubled down on its partnership with Nvidia, said it was entering a multi-year agreement with AMD to support its AI infrastructure buildout.\n\nIt plans to deploy AMD's custom Instinct GPUs, with shipments expected to start in the second half of 2026, the companies said on Tuesday.\n\nAMD's stock was up by as much as nearly 12% premarket following the announcement.\n\nThe deal would also allow Meta to purchase up to 10% of AMD's stock, with the shares vesting based on certain shipping milestones agreed upon by the companies.\n\n\"We're excited to form a long-term partnership with AMD to deploy efficient inference compute and deliver personal superintelligence,\" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement. He added that the deal was an important step for Meta as it diversifies the chips it uses to power its AI bets.\n\nIt's the latest mega-chip deal struck by AMD, with the company agreeing to a multi-year partnership to provide its AI chips to OpenAI in October.\n\nLast week, Meta expanded its partnership with Nvidia with a \"multigenerational\" deal, committing to use millions of Nvidia's current and next-generation chips for its AI buildout.\n\nThe deals continue to underscore the vast amount of infrastructure companies believe is required to meet AI demand. To put Meta and AMD's deal in perspective, 1 gigawatt is roughly equivalent to the power needed to run the homes of a midsize city like San Francisco.",

    "description": "The rowhouse in Washington, DC, was built in 1794, but has some modern flourishes. See the historic home.",
    "fullText": "Surrounded by modern developments along Washington, DC's Southwest waterfront, a slice of 18th-century Federalist America still proudly sits in the nation's capital. The Wheat Row homes, a collection of rowhouses along 4th Street SW, have stood the test of time, and now one of them is up for sale.\n\n1317 4th Street SW has a listing price of $1.3 million and offers the charm of a historic house with more modern touches throughout, according to Eric Stewart, the home's listing agent from Long & Foster Real Estate.\n\n\"It's comfortable for contemporary living and enjoyment, but with the heart of classic colonialism,\" Stewart told Business Insider.\n\nThis colonial heart isn't all talk — the homes are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and were among the first housing developments built in DC after it became America's capital city.\n\nThe property's current seller is a retired history professor with an appreciation for the home's past, according to Stewart. Stewart said the ideal potential buyer would carry this same appreciation.\n\n\"Everybody wants to be able to see something built in that era, but not everybody wants to live in a home from that age,\" Stewart said.\n\nToday, the home is fitted with more modern amenities, sparing potential buyers the conditions the first residents endured before DC had a sewage system.\n\nTake a look inside this historic Wheat Row home.\n\nThough the four-floor home is narrow and compact, the 12-foot ceilings make for a spacious interior.\n\nHardwood floors cover nearly the entire house, including the stairs.\n\nThe home has eye-catching millwork in nearly every room. According to Stewart, the home's wooden moldings date back to the 19th century and possibly earlier.\n\nThis extensive woodworking was common in this era of homes, with moldings and trims produced by skilled artisans influenced by European styles, according to Pebbles & Thorns Woodworking.\n\nIn multiple rooms, there are low-hanging chandeliers or candle-like light fixtures, once again defined by the colonial era.\n\nChandeliers were once a symbol of wealth and extravagance, and while that standard is still reflected in modern design, the introduction of electric lighting in the late 19th century allowed for more affordable chandeliers, per The Examiner News.\n\nEven though the elevator was added in 2005, it has a classic charm, with all-wooden walls inside.\n\nThe home's large kitchen was last renovated over half a century ago, meaning it would need about $100,000 of work to bring it into the modern era, by Stewart's estimates.\n\nAlternatively, a buyer could work to restore the kitchen's true colonial look and feel with classic wooden cabinets and finishes.\n\nThis not only creates the potential for multiple residents, but the home's four different floors also allow for privacy.\n\nThe home's 1950s bathrooms could also be renovated. One quirk is split bathrooms on the third and fourth floors — they have a shower and toilet/sink separated by a wall.\n\nCommon for the time period, the property's centerpieces are its seven fireplaces, which appear on every single floor of the home.\n\nAlthough this defining feature adds to the home's quaintness, it creates hurdles for any buyer considering renovation. Stewart said that the rooms' layout around the fireplaces complicates any attempts at reconfiguration.\n\n\"We're looking for a buyer who likes a home that is older in style and feel and embraces the uniqueness of the property, or somebody that has the vision to restore the majesty of the property, but refresh and renew it into a 21st-century rowhouse,\" Stewart said.\n\nWith lots of opportunities for renovation, the home could appeal to buyers looking for a project.\n\n\"It poses a good value for someone who has a vision,\" Stewart added.\n\nStewart said the housing market in Southwest Washington, DC, has been struggling after a wave of job cuts last year.\n\nHistoric homes like the Wheat Row home could attract outside buyers looking to stake their claim in pieces of American history.\n\nThe Wheat Row homes sit along DC's Washington Channel, running parallel to the Potomac River.\n\nWheat Row residents, as part of the Harbour Square co-op, get access to a rooftop deck, which overlooks the water. Other co-op amenities include a shared heated pool, gardens, and a fitness center.\n\nThe home sits in the middle of a booming modern neighborhood known as The Wharf, which has undergone redevelopment over the past two decades.\n\nThe area is filled with theaters and concert halls, offices, restaurants, and public spaces.",

    "description": "Paramount Skydance just revised its bid for WBD. David Ellison's new offer could put pressure on Netflix to change its own.",
    "fullText": "David Ellison's Paramount Skydance has revised its bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, putting pressure on Netflix to follow suit.\n\nParamount did not publicly share a price for its revised bid, which is its 10th. The company's previous offer was for $30 per share.\n\nWBD told shareholders last week that \"a senior representative\" from Paramount said the company would pay at least $31 per share for WBD, and that its previous bid wasn't the company's \"best and final\" proposal.\n\n\"Following engagement with PSKY during the seven-day limited waiver period, we received a revised PSKY proposal to acquire WBD, which we are reviewing in consultation with our financial and legal advisors,\" WBD said in a statement on Tuesday. \"We will update our shareholders following the Board's review. The Netflix merger agreement remains in effect, and the Board continues to recommend in favor of the Netflix transaction. WBD shareholders are advised not to take any action at this time with respect to the amended PSKY tender offer.\"\n\nIf WBD's board determines that Paramount's latest offer is \"potentially superior or superior\" to Netflix's, then Netflix would have four days to improve its offer, a person familiar with the deal process said.\n\nWBD previously turned down Paramount's offers and decided to sell key assets, including its studio and HBO, to Netflix for $27.75 per share. The Netflix deal doesn't include WBD's cable channels, such as HGTV and TNT, unlike Paramount's bid.\n\nA higher Paramount offer should come as little surprise, despite Ellison saying his previous bid was \"superior to Netflix's.\" Paramount had sweetened its offer several times before this latest one.\n\nThe Paramount head honcho was also overheard saying in mid-December that WBD's board couldn't accept his $30-per-share bid without \"admitting breach of fiduciary duty,\" Business Insider reported. That's because it was the same offer the WBD board — which has a duty to act in the best interest of shareholders — had previously rejected.\n\nAll this suggested that an upgraded bid could be in the works.\n\nWBD had raised several issues with Paramount's previous offers, including that its equity wasn't fully backstopped by Larry Ellison and its termination fee was lower than Netflix's. Paramount addressed both points. WBD then said there would be additional costs it would incur if it accepted Paramount's bid, such as a $2.8 billion breakup fee to Netflix, which Paramount said it had accounted for in its ninth bid.\n\nA key part of Paramount's argument is that WBD's TV networks aren't worth much, if anything, after factoring in debt and the trading price of Versant, a similar company.\n\nNetflix, for its part, is pitching itself as a better option for shareholders and the entertainment industry, and has said that a Netflix-Warner Bros. tie-up would \"create and protect jobs.\"\n\nThe merger would have to go through an antitrust review. One wild card is President Donald Trump. Last week, a White House spokesperson told Business Insider that Trump \"has great relationships with all parties in this potential transaction and remains neutral in this process with no preference for either bidder.\"\n\nThen, on Saturday, Trump called for Netflix to remove Susan Rice from its board \"or pay the consequences.\" During a podcast appearance, Rice, who served in senior roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, had made comments critical of the Trump administration and corporations that \"take a knee.\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos downplayed the president's comments on Monday and added that their bid for Warner Bros. is \"not a political deal.\"\n\nRegardless of who wins between Netflix and Paramount, a bidding war would benefit WBD shareholders. Kevin Mayer, Disney's former top dealmaker, predicted in December that the battle between Netflix and Paramount could raise the cost to buy WBD by $5 billion to $10 billion.\n\nEven if WBD's board rejects Paramount for a 10th time, Ellison can continue to make bids up until WBD's shareholder vote on March 20.",

    "fullText": "As empty nesters who both work from home, my husband and I try our best to choose nutritious food options while keeping our grocery costs low.\n\nLuckily, shopping at Aldi helps us achieve both of these goals. Here are some of our favorite products to buy.\n\nMy husband recently stopped buying Clif Bars and replaced them with the more budget-friendly Elevation energy bars from Aldi.\n\nThese come out to just about $1 per bar, and he says the taste and texture are great.\n\nHe likes to enjoy them as a snack or an afternoon pick-me-up.\n\nThe Simply Nature coconut clusters satisfy my sweet tooth, with only 160 calories per serving.\n\nThese crunchy clusters are made with a mix of pumpkin, sunflower, and hemp seeds.\n\nWhenever I head to Aldi, I like to grab snack-size portions of trail mix. I especially love the Southern Grove version because it doesn't include raisins.\n\nPacked with cranberries, sunflower kernels, almonds, edamame, chocolate, and peanuts, this mix is easy to snack on at home or when we're hiking with our dog.\n\nI'm always hunting for delicious protein options to start my day, and I often find myself craving the egg bites from Starbucks. However, my wallet doesn't love them as much as I do.\n\nSo, I've switched to Aldi's Whole & Simple version, made with bell peppers, uncured ham, and cheddar. I think they taste similar to the Starbucks version and they're easy to heat up at home.\n\nSince we both work from home, my husband and I are always looking for quick lunch options. We like the Happy Farms spreadable cheese wedges, which cost less than $3 each, and taste great on their own or in wraps.\n\nAt only 35 calories per cup, I like to have Simply Nature popcorn with my lunch or as a movie-watching snack when the kids come back home. It's also a good source of fiber and is gluten-free.\n\nWhenever I take a trip to Aldi, I look for the Season's Choice steamed vegetable medleys. These bags of brightly-colored veggies are reasonably priced and easy to make.\n\nInstead of ordering take-out, I like to season my steamed vegetables with Burman's orange or sweet and sour sauces. I just add some chicken to create an easy stir-fry meal.\n\nStaying hydrated while working from home is a necessity, and I love sipping on the Summit Popz prebiotic sodas. I think they're a great alternative to the more expensive Poppi sodas.\n\nClick to keep reading Aldi diaries like this one.",

    "description": "Astelia CEO Alon Noy, a former leader of Israel's National Red Team, said that traditional cybersecurity has \"no chance\" against AI-powered attackers.",
    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence has supercharged the cybersecurity arms race. Attackers are rushing to harness the tech to break into systems, leaving defenders no choice but to adopt it as well to fend them off.\n\nAlon Noy, who previously led an Israeli intelligence unit that tested the nation's cyber defenses, saw that paradigm shift as an irresistible opportunity to wield his cybersecurity skills and \"protect the world,\" he told Business Insider in an exclusive interview this week.\n\nNoy is the CEO and cofounder of Astelia, a cybersecurity startup that uses AI to analyze an enterprise's systems, identify the tiny fraction of vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit, and help plug those holes in its defenses.\n\nAstelia announced on Tuesday that it has raised $35 million in a combined seed and Series A funding round led by Index Ventures and Team8.\n\nNoy spoke to Business Insider about why he thinks Astelia is the perfect bulwark against a new generation of cybersecurity threats, how he plans to use his investors' cash, and how young people can get ahead in the AI era.\n\nHe said that stress-testing Israel's critical infrastructure defenses helped him realize the value of being able to \"think like an attacker.\"\n\nNoy's cofounders, Nadav Ostrovsky and Roy Rajwan, also worked on Israel's National Red Team, mimicking attackers to test the country's critical infrastructure defenses.\n\nNoy explained that advances in AI have dramatically increased the number of vulnerabilities in an enterprise's computer systems and radically reduced the time needed to exploit them.\n\nThat creates a \"bad equation between the attackers and defenders,\" he said. When attackers use AI tools to rapidly identify and exploit vulnerabilities, defenders with only traditional tools \"have no chance to win the race,\" he added.\n\nNoy said a key challenge is that many enterprises have \"endless backlogs of vulnerabilities\" but limited resources to address them. He added that it's close to \"mission impossible\" to find the \"needles in the haystack\" — the vulnerabilities that are truly exploitable.\n\nAstelia combines AI agents with network and environment analysis of a customer's systems to pinpoint the 1% or 2% of vulnerabilities that are genuinely risky, he said.\n\nThe company can preemptively spot holes in a security system before they're ever exploited, which is \"super valuable for customers,\" Noy said.\n\nHe gave the example of a telecoms business that had a few million vulnerabilities in its backlog and no idea how to prioritize them. Astelia pinpointed the few hundred of those that posed genuine threats and helped tackle them, he said.\n\nNoy said he would use the fresh funds to ramp up Astelia's go-to-market team and bolster its R&D team. He said the startup would likely double in headcount by the end of this year, from around 30 people today to between 60 and 70 by December's close.\n\nJuriaan Duizendstraal, a partner at Index Ventures, said in a press release announcing the raise that AI is forcing enterprises to shift from \"assumed risk to provable exposure,\" and Astelia helps them to \"turn vulnerability management from a reactive scramble into a preemptive defense.\"\n\nAmir Zilberstein, a managing partner at Team8, wrote that his firm invested in part because of the Astelia team's \"rare understanding of how security failures emerge in real environments.\"\n\n\"Astelia cuts through vulnerability noise by grounding decisions in real exposure, and we believe this team is redefining how enterprises operationalize security,\" he added.\n\nNoy also spoke to Business Insider about how AI is changing the wider world.\n\nHe said the immense buzz around the tech is justified, but companies won't succeed long-term by simply using AI. They need to have a \"moat\" to fend off competitors, such as access to proprietary data, he said.\n\nNoy cautioned that many people are too relaxed about uploading personal information to ChatGPT and other AI chatbots, as they don't realize their sensitive data could be used to train the models, or consider that it might be leaked.\n\nHe also offered advice to young people worried about an affordability crisis and AI replacing humans in many jobs.\n\nNoy recommended they become \"good friends with AI\" and use it for everything from coding to planning, shopping, messaging, and managing tasks.\n\nHe said that could help them stay updated on the tech's latest abilities and shortcomings, and keep up with a fast-changing market, instead of getting \"left behind.\"",

    "fullText": "I'd be lying if I said I always had a desire to travel.\n\nAs a shy, introverted kid, I never had big dreams of adventures in faraway places. In fact, I didn't even own a passport until my family moved from the US to Ireland for my dad's job when I was 16.\n\nNow, things couldn't be more different. Living abroad opened my eyes to the world, and I was bitten by the travel bug.\n\nAt 23 years old, I've been lucky enough to have visited 25 countries across six continents, and my desire to travel has only grown.\n\nPeople often ask which country is my favorite, but honestly, it feels like an impossible question to answer. Each place I've visited has been vastly different and offered unique experiences.\n\nThat being said, there are a few countries I'll never say no to revisiting. From endless history to diverse landscapes, these three countries are places I'll go back to without a second thought.\n\nAlthough I may be biased, I think Ireland is a magical place to visit. From the friendly people to the breathtaking landscapes, it's a country I always want to come back to. Even after living there and returning almost a dozen times since, there's still so much more I want to see.\n\nIn addition to cultural hubs like Dublin and Cork, which have everything from great museums and distilleries to delicious food, I've loved visiting some of the country's smaller towns. In my opinion, they're the best way to get a taste of true Irish culture.\n\nI always recommend snagging a reservation at one of the top-rated restaurants in Kinsale, taking a boat tour in Dingle, or exploring a castle in Adare.\n\nI've visited Egypt twice now, and it's one of the most culturally rich places I've ever been. I've always found the people to be incredibly welcoming, and I've barely scratched the surface of everything there is to see.\n\nPlus, I love enjoying koshari, a traditional street food made with rice, noodles, lentils, chickpeas, and a tasty tomato garlic sauce. This dish alone is enough for me to want to return again and again.\n\nOn my first trip, I assumed I would cover everything in a week. I centered most of my trip around the Cairo area, seeing the pyramids, visiting museums, and roaming through street markets.\n\nI also checked out the Faiyum Oasis, where I sandboarded on the dunes and relaxed by desert lakes. Then, I explored the historic city of Alexandria, situated in Northern Egypt on the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nAlthough this was a great introduction to Egypt, I quickly realized I would need many more return trips to cover everything I wanted to see.\n\nWith an efficient public transportation system and a wide range of things to do, Germany truly has something for everyone.\n\nI've now visited the country several times, but first went in 2018 when my family went to a Christmas market in Stuttgart. The atmosphere was enchanting, and the food was nothing short of delicious.\n\nOn another trip, I visited a friend who lived in Berlin and I fell in love with the city. Over the course of five days, I took in the art, history, and shopping scene. Berlin also gets major bonus points from me, because I was able to find a lot of great vegetarian food options.\n\nAnother thing I loved doing in Germany was driving through the countryside in a convertible to visit Neuschwanstein Castle.\n\nThe rolling green hills, cows with bells dangling from their necks, and castle in the distance felt like something out of a movie. It was a simple day, but it's probably one of my favorite travel experiences.\n\nThis story was originally published on November 6, 2025, and most recently updated on February 24, 2026.",

    "fullText": "Earlier this month, we wrote about how the software sector had been marked with the scarlet letter of AI disruption. We declared that no matter what it did going forward, it would always have to contend with the perception that it's a sitting duck.\n\nFast-forward a few weeks, and the picture for software has gotten even bleaker. The most popular ETF tracking the sector has tumbled to the lowest since 2023. Wall Street analysts are taking cleavers to their price targets in the space.\n\nWhat's more, software has become the new lightning rod for risk-off AI aversion. If investors are in play-it-safe mode and rotating out of tech, they're dumping the group first and asking questions later. At this point, the sector's reputation precedes it.\n\nThis dynamic played out on Monday as software stocks sold off sharply as the ever-evolving US tariff situation sparked investor uncertainty. Throwing fuel on the flames was a viral blog post from Citrini Research laying out a drastic bearish scenario for the US market and economy.\n\nI won't drag you into the ominous nitty-gritty of the Citrini report, but I will give you a brief summary. The firm lays out a thought-experiment scenario where AI drives large-scale white-collar displacement, which destroys consumer demand and triggers downturns in markets and the economy.\n\nNot exactly the feel-good read of the year. But while the doomsaying was compelling, what struck me the most was how the blog post treated the decline of software as a foregone conclusion — a formative event for a grander AI bubble across many sectors.\n\nAs if the vibes around software weren't negative enough, the sector's narrative is now intersecting with another hot-button topic: private credit. Many of the software companies branded as vulnerable have significant debt loads. And a lot of that debt is due to private credit lenders. Citrini dedicated a whole section of its report to systemic credit risk.\n\nBen McMillan, the chief investment officer at IDX Advisors, told BI recently that he sees lax private-market underwriting as something that could eventually come back to bite.\n\nBigger picture, it's clear that software's role as the ringleader of the so-called AI \"scare trade\" is locked in — but it's far from the only member. Insurance brokers, real estate services companies, and wealth managers have gotten whacked in recent weeks. AI is a fickle, market-value-erasing beast.\n\nBut software should still be monitored closely. Its current role as a punching bag makes it even more important to watch as a bellwether of the AI trade.",

    "description": "My 84-year-old grandpa joined me on my trip to Malta. At first, I was nervous about us traveling together, but I'm so grateful for the experience.",
    "fullText": "To me, Malta had always seemed like a special place.\n\nI'd grown up hearing stories from my dad about the joys of his childhood on the island, from after-school swims to days spent cliff-jumping.\n\nAlthough I'd been there as a kid, I wanted to go back as an adult to see what magic I'd missed on past visits and learn more about some of my family's roots.\n\nSo, last year, I booked a two-week solo trip to Malta. When I told my paternal grandpa about my plans, though, I had no idea he'd take it as an invitation to join me for a week.\n\nBefore I knew it, he'd bought his plane tickets, dug up his 50-year-old translation book, and had a map of Malta unfolded on the table.\n\nMy grandpa and I have always had a close bond thanks to years of weekly FaceTimes with him and my nana, plus our annual trips together.\n\nStill, I couldn't help feeling a little cautious, wondering if we'd drive each other mad (correction, if he'd drive me mad) after spending seven days straight together.\n\nWould we run out of things to talk about? At 84 years old, would he slow me down?\n\nUpon reflection, I feel a bit guilty for ever doubting him. I mean, exploring the streets of Valletta hardly compares to skydiving on his 80th birthday or climbing a mountain on his 83rd.\n\nHe carries an adventurous spirit into everything he does, and visiting Malta together was no exception. From jumping out of boats into crystal clear waters to walking almost 13,000 steps a day in the sun, I was the one who needed power naps — not him.\n\nThroughout our trip, we thoroughly enjoyed each other's company, often ending our busy days by sharing a few glasses of wine.\n\nI'll remember and cherish these moments forever, not because I may have let a few too many secrets about my smoking and drinking habits at university slip, but because at 25 and 84 years old, we never ran out of things to talk about. Our conversations were truly special.\n\nOne of my favorite moments, though, was when we visited his old home in Mtarfa, where the well-known kindness of the Maltese people truly shone.\n\nThe current owners welcomed us inside and allowed us to wander the halls where my dad once ran around as a boy.\n\nHaving lost my nana a few years ago, this experience felt all the more emotional and touching. Seeing her old bedroom and the garden where she used to sunbathe (with her pet duck sitting on her back), it's no surprise that my papa and I found ourselves a little emotional.\n\nAlthough our trip wasn't all smooth sailing — grandparents, please stop zooming in so much when you take photos — I found it to be a gentle reminder that spending time with your loved ones is the most important thing in life.\n\nMy grandpa painted a picture of what Malta was like 50 years ago — a time when life felt simpler, more stripped-back, and fully lived — and sharing this experience gave me a deeper understanding of why it was so special to my dad.\n\nAfter ordering my grandpa an Uber to the airport (his disbelief that you could hire a car through your phone still fresh in my mind), I admittedly felt a little sad.\n\nMaybe it was because I'd now be on my own for another week, but more than anything, it was the overwhelming gratitude for the special week we'd just shared.\n\nIt's a trip we both say we'll always hold close to our hearts, and one we look forward to taking again.\n\nIf you ever needed a sign to visit loved ones, let this be it — life's too short not to spend time with family.",

    "fullText": "In a tearful new video post on Tuesday, Savannah Guthrie acknowledged her missing mother may already be dead as she announced that her family is offering as much as $1 million for her return.\n\nThe \"Today\" show host said in the Instagram video message that her family still believes \"in a miracle,\" but said, \"We also know that she may be lost.\"\n\n\"She may already be gone,\" Guthrie said of her 84-year-old mother, Nancy Guthrie. \"She may have already gone home to the lord that she loves and is dancing in heaven with her mom and her dad and with her beloved brother, Pierce, and with our daddy.\"\n\n\"If this is what is to be, then we will accept it,\" an emotional Savannah Guthrie said.\n\nAuthorities believe Nancy Guthrie was abducted from her Arizona home more than three weeks ago in the middle of the night.\n\nSavannah Guthrie said while her family is confronting the possibility of the worst, \"We need to know where she is.\"\n\n\"We need her to come home,\" she said. \"For that reason, we are offering a family reward of up to $1 million for any information that leads us to her recovery.\"\n\nA post shared by Savannah Guthrie (@savannahguthrie)\n\nThat reward is on top of the $100,000 that the FBI has already offered for information related to Nancy Guthrie's disappearance.\n\nThe FBI's Phoenix field office said in X post on Tuesday that Nancy Guthrie's family is \"offering a private $1 million reward for credible information that directly leads to her return.\"\n\nThe FBI asked the public to contact the agency's tip line at 1-800-CALL-FBI if anyone has firsthand knowledge of the woman's whereabouts.\n\nThis week, the intensive search for Nancy Guthrie entered its fourth week, and key questions about what happened and why remain unanswered.\n\nLocal law enforcement and the FBI are still trying to identify the masked and armed man who was captured on footage from Nancy Guthrie's missing Nest doorbell camera the night she vanished.\n\n\"It is day 24 since our mom was taken in the dark of night from her bed, and every hour and minute and second and every long night has been agony since then of worrying about her and fearing for her, aching for her, and most of all, just missing her,\" Savannah Guthrie said in the Tuesday video post.\n\nThe famed NBC anchor added, \"If you hear this message, if you've been waiting and you haven't been sure, let this be your sign to please come forward, tell what you know, help us bring our beloved mom home so that we can either celebrate a glorious, miraculous homecoming or celebrate the beautiful, brave and courageous and noble life that she has lived.\n\n\"Please be the light in the dark,\" Savannah Guthrie said.\n\nSavannah Guthrie also said her family was donating $500,000 to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a nonprofit, because \"we know there are millions of families that have suffered with this kind of uncertainty.\"\n\n\"We are hoping that the attention that has been given to our mom and our family will extend to all the families like ours who are in need and need prayers and need support,\" she said.",

    "title": "They split a $4,470 RV three ways. Now their food truck makes $240,000 annually.",
    "description": "Three entrepreneurs bought a former mobile dentistry RV for $5,000 and turned it into a food truck that now generates around $240,000 in annual sales.",
    "fullText": "When self-taught private chef Isaac Flomo began posting images of his signature Southern comfort food on social media, he was delighted by the positive feedback.\n\nSome of his clients in his native city of Minneapolis included professional athletes with the Minnesota Timberwolves and Minnesota Vikings. Flomo's popularity soared when players shared photos of his classic recipes, such as chicken wings in Dijon Buffalo sauce and steak-and-cheese fries.\n\nHe worked out of his home kitchen but couldn't keep up with demand.\n\n\"I'd post that a plate would be available within a certain timeframe, but you'd have to pick it up before it was gone,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nFlomo's friends from childhood, JT Tarwai and Eddie Adegeye, saw the potential to build on his success and expand into the restaurant trade. The entrepreneurial trio talked about collaborating when the time was right.\n\nBut they were preoccupied with existing ventures and other plans ranging from wellness consulting and insurance to an assisted living company, a car dealership, and real estate.\n\nOne night in 2019, the friends found themselves hanging out in an RV belonging to Tarwai's uncle, watching TV, playing cards, and eating snacks.\n\nThe laid-back evening got them thinking about their latent idea: instead of the high stakes of investing in a brick-and-mortar restaurant, how about the slow rollout of a mobile food facility?\n\nThe 31-year-olds discreetly questioned people they knew in the Minneapolis nightlife scene who bemoaned the lack of affordable late-night eateries.\n\n\"They confirmed what we already knew,\" Tarwei said. \"There was a good customer base.\"\n\nThe pandemic delayed their business plan, but they tossed around ideas for the kind of vehicle they should use. In 2021, Flomo watched a YouTube video about a man who converted a yellow school bus into a mobile home.\n\n\"I thought it would be the perfect solution for us,\" he said. They looked into buying one, but nothing suitable came up.\n\nThen, they stumbled upon an unusual deal on the auction site, K-bid.com: an ad for a 1996 Winnebago that had been used as a mobile dentistry unit on a native American Indian reservation.\n\nIt had less than 400,000 miles on the clock and had been stripped of most of its specialist equipment, such as dental chairs. It contained office supplies, a bathroom, powerful LED lights in the treatment area, and random items such as examination gloves and a replica of a human jaw with teeth.\n\n\"It needed a bit of TLC, but it was perfect for us,\" Adegeye said.\n\nThe team split the $4,470 purchase three ways before an unexpected setback nearly derailed the project.\n\nThey hadn't bargained for major mechanical issues and soon discovered that the truck's axle needed immediate replacement for a hefty $15,000.\n\nIt prompted discussion about whether they'd made a terrible mistake. Still, the disappointment didn't last long.\n\n\"We're a bunch of optimists,\" Adegeye said. \"It would take more than that to keep us down because the food truck was a dream come true.\"\n\nThe estimated $100,000 renovation took two years to complete, with most of the money spent on labor. Contractors installed everything from stainless steel walls and counters to custom-made kitchen fittings, such as prep coolers.\n\nThe vehicle had to meet strict safety and hygiene codes, including the mandatory installation of an $8,000 fire-suppression system over the griddle.\n\nFlo's Eats LLC — named for Flomo — finally received its operating license on June 6, 2023, ahead of a soft opening near a bar in downtown Minneapolis's North Loop a week later.\n\n\"We knew there was a lot of foot traffic along that particular street,\" Tarwai said. \"Besides, we had to start somewhere.\"\n\nThe experiment was an unmitigated success. The team could barely keep up with demand and risked running out of ingredients.\n\nBusiness has been booming ever since. The truck has made such a name for itself, there is healthy competition among premises owners to have it parked outside their buildings at night.\n\nIt also serves workers during the day who lunch near The Commons, a green space in the heart of Minneapolis.\n\n\"We could never have imagined it would skyrocket in this way,\" Adebeye said. He said the business, which usually operates between March and November, has reached annual sales of $240,000.\n\nThe menu started out as — and has remained — relatively simple. Flomo said the best-sellers include his $17 buttermilk-fried chicken sandwich and $11 grilled cheese on garlic bread. \"Why change what's trusted and most popular?\" he said.\n\nSpecial events are another lucrative side of the enterprise. Flo's Eats has secured dates at large-scale city celebrations, including the Minneapolis Aquatennial over July 4 and the annual Monarch Festival, celebrating the butterfly migration to Mexico.\n\nTarwai said the lines of hundreds of people stretched so far that they couldn't see the end. They cope with the stress, he said, by dividing up the labor as fairly as possible.\n\n\"We can all work the different spots on the truck, whether it's griddle man, cashier, or something else,\" he said, noting that the truck goes out five or six times each week in peak season.\n\nThe biggest challenge for now is deciding on the next steps. The team has invested in a second RV — \"not a dental unit, this time,\" Adebeye said — which is expected to hit the streets this summer.\n\n\"The one thing we don't want to do is spread ourselves too thin and not be able to serve our home community,\" he said. \"In the meantime, we're enjoying the ride.\"",

    "title": "All 43 musicians who have pulled double duty as host and musical guest on 'SNL'",
    "description": "Timothée Chalamet, Harry Styles, and Sabrina Carpenter are the most recent celebs to take on the double-duty challenge at \"Saturday Night Live.\"",
    "fullText": "\"Saturday Night Live\" is in the middle of its 51st season, and with that comes a new drop of host announcements, including that none other than Harry Styles will be returning to Studio 8H just after the release of his fourth album, \"Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Style has been both the musical guest and host. He first hosted and performed in 2019 during season 45.\n\nMany other stars have served as both host and musical guest on \"SNL.\" From Paul Simon to Dolly Parton to MC Hammer, here are all the musicians who've taken a crack at comedy in Studio 8H.\n\nSimon has been both host and musical guest four times over the years.\n\nThe first time he appeared on the show was October 18, 1975 — the second episode ever of \"SNL.\" He brought in multiple musical friends to help, including Art Garfunkel, Randy Newman, and Phoebe Snow.\n\nThe \"Graceland\" singer returned the following season on November 20, 1976. This time, he brought along George Harrison and the two sang a memorable rendition of \"Here Comes the Sun.\"\n\nHe hosted the next two times: on May 10, 1986, during season 11, and on December 19, 1987, during season 13.\n\nIn total, Simon has had \"four hosting stints, nine musical guest appearances, and six cameos,\" according to Vulture.\n\nArnaz was 58 years old when he hosted and performed on the episode that aired on February 21, 1976.\n\nHe invited his son, Desi Arnaz, Jr., onstage to sing \"Cuban Pete\" and \"Babalu.\" His son was just 23 years old at the time.\n\nCharles was both host and musical guest during the season three episode that aired on November 12, 1977.\n\nHe sang more than the now-typical two songs during this episode. He performed \"I Can See Clearly Now,\" \"What'd I Say,\" \"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'\" and a medley of \"I Got a Woman,\" \"I Believe to My Soul,\" \"Them That Got,\" and \"Hit the Road Jack\".\n\nAccording to \"SNL\" lore, Zappa's hosting performance on October 21, 1978, led to him getting barred from Studio 8H forever.\n\nZappa had already been the musical guest prior to his season four appearance, in which he took over hosting duties as well. He sang three songs: \"Dancin' Fool,\" \"The Meek Shall Inherit Nothing,\" and an instrumental version of the unreleased song \"Rollo.\"\n\nHowever, his lackluster hosting didn't go over well. Former \"SNL\" star Don Novello even called Zappa's show \"one of the worst ever\" in the tell-all book \"Live From New York.\"\n\nThe Blondie frontwoman appeared as a solo act on February 14, 1981, while also hosting.\n\nShe hosted an episode during the ill-fated sixth season, which was helmed by Dick Ebersol, instead of creator Lorne Michaels.\n\nHarry hosted the episode five months before her first solo album, \"KooKoo\" would be released. Harry sang \"Love TKO\" and \"Come Back Jonee.\"\n\nNewton-John did double duty on May 22, 1982, successfully reprising her character from \"Grease\" and singing her hit song, \"Physical.\"\n\nArguably, she was equally considered a musician and an actor, which distinguished her from her predecessors on this list.\n\nThe Australian songstress sang \"Physical,\" \"Make a Move on Me,\" and \"Landslide.\"\n\nTomlin hosted as herself, while her male alter-ego Pervis Hawkins was the musical guest on January 22, 1983, during season eight.\n\nIn a musical performance that would never fly today, Tomlin sang as Pervis Hawkins, a Black R&B singer who was clearly modeled on Black musicians like Luther Vandross and Marvin Gaye.\n\nA few months after Lily Tomlin, on May 7, 1983, Stevie Wonder would also take over the hosting and performing gig.\n\nWonder made it publicly known that he would've returned to the \"SNL\" stage once again if he was the musical guest for Eddie Murphy's episode in December 2019.\n\n\"He's a superstar. If he wants me to, I will do it,\" Wonder told TooFab. The honor eventually went to Lizzo instead.\n\nDuring his 1983 appearance, Wonder appeared alongside Murphy, who frequently impersonated him on the show. The two sang \"My Cherie Amour\" during the sketch.\n\nHe also sang \"Overjoyed\" and \"Go Home.\"\n\nWillie Nelson joined the double-duty club on February 21, 1987, during season 12. The legendary stoner sang his songs \"Blue Eyes\" and \"Partners After All,\" and also performed a duet with cast member Victoria Jackson.\n\nJust a few months before she'd appear in \"Steel Magnolias,\" the country icon dropped by Studio 8H to host an episode and to perform \"Why'd You Come in Here Lookin' Like That,\" and \"White Limozeen\" during a season 14 episode that aired on April 15, 1989.\n\nIn season 16, Sting hosted the January 19, 1991, episode without the rest of his Police band members.\n\nPrior to this episode, Sting had appeared as solely the musical guest in a 1987 episode. This time, he took on the hosting gig as well, and performed \"All This Time,\" \"Mad About You\" and a cover of the Jimi Hendrix Experience song, \"Purple Haze.\"\n\nHe'd return to host an episode in 1997, with Veruca Salt as the musical guest.\n\nMC Hammer became the first rapper to host and perform on December 7, 1991, during season 17.\n\nThe flamboyant rapper sang his smash hit \"2 Legit 2 Quit,\" \"This Is the Way We Roll,\" and his song recorded for \"The Addams Family\" movie, \"Addams Groove.\"\n\nChristina Ricci and Jimmy Workman, who played Wednesday and Pugsley Addams respectively, were on hand to introduce him in character.\n\nBrooks has pulled double duty twice, although, during his second episode, he performed as rock alter ego Chris Gaines.\n\nBrooks' first episode during season 23 on February 28, 1998, went by as a pretty run-of-the-mill episode, and he sang \"Two Piña Coladas.\"\n\nWhen he returned two seasons later, on November 13, 1999, Brooks hosted the show as himself but performed as his alt-rock alter ego, Chris Gaines. He performed a song from Gaines' album, \"The Life of Chris Gaines,\" called \"Way of the Girl.\"\n\nSpears has also taken on this responsibility twice: once in season 25 and once in season 27.\n\nWhile she might not seem like the most obvious choice for sketch comedy, she certainly held her own during both episodes she hosted.\n\nDuring her May 13, 2000, episode she was part of the sketch in which Rachel Dratch and Jimmy Fallon's \"Boston Teens\" made their first appearance. She also sang \"Oops!... I Did It Again,\" and \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know.\"\n\nWhen she returned on February 2, 2002, she earned laughs in the \"Inside Barbie's Dreamhouse\" sketch alongside Amy Poehler. Her first performance, \"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman,\" was introduced by then-boyfriend, Justin Timberlake. She also sang \"Boys.\"\n\nLopez made her first appearance on the show on February 10, 2001, during season 26. The New York Daily News reported Lopez was the first Hispanic person to host and perform.\n\nDuring her monologue, she brought her famous Versace Grammys dress out of retirement. She also sang \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" and \"Play.\"\n\nAfter a nine-year hiatus, she made an \"SNL\" comeback on February 27, 2010, during season 35, singing \"Until It Beats No More\" and \"Starting Over.\"\n\nExcluding his appearance with NSYNC, Timberlake made his \"SNL\" debut on October 11, 2003, during season 29.\n\nThis episode saw the beginnings of the epic Justin Timberlake/Jimmy Fallon friendship, and it marked the debut of \"The Barry Gibb Talk Show,\" which remains a staple of Timberlake's appearances on the show (it was brought back yet again in 2024 when Timberlake was just a musical guest in season 49). He also sang \"Rock Your Body,\" \"Señorita,\" and \"Cry Me a River.\"\n\nThree years later, in season 32 on December 16, 2006, Timberlake returned — and this time, won an Emmy for his troubles. A digital short from the episode went viral after the uncensored version was posted on YouTube. He also performed \"My Love\" and \"What Goes Around... Comes Around.\"\n\nTimberlake made it a threepeat on March 9, 2013, during season 38. Besides his third stint as a musical guest/host, it was also his fifth time hosting overall, with other members of \"The Five-Timers Club\" appearing during his monologue, including Tom Hanks, Martin Short, Chevy Chase, and Candice Bergen.\n\nTimberlake performed \"Mirrors\" and his collaboration with Jay-Z, \"Suit & Tie,\" during which the rapper appeared onstage.\n\nJackson made her hosting debut on April 10, 2004, in season 29.\n\nThough she had previously performed as a musical guest, Jackson showed off her comedic chops as a host. During her episode, she reprised her role from the '70s sitcom \"Good Times\" alongside former \"SNL\" cast member Tracy Morgan.\n\nShe sang \"All Nite (Don't Stop)\" and \"Strawberry Bounce.\"\n\nQueen Latifah added her name to the list on October 9, 2004, during the show's 30th season.\n\nThe rapper and actor was there promoting her 2004 film \"Taxi,\" which costarred \"SNL\" alum Jimmy Fallon, and her album \"The Dana Owens Album,\" which was released the week prior.\n\nShe performed \"The Same Love That Made Me Laugh\" and \"Hard Times.\"\n\nJust a few years after Ludacris proved he could act in the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise, he stopped by \"SNL\" on November 18, 2006, during season 32.\n\nLudacris took his talents to Studio 8H right after his album \"Release Therapy\" debuted in September. The rapper performed \"Money Maker\" and \"Runaway Love,\" during which Mary J. Blige appeared as well.\n\nSwift brought music into her monologue with \"The Monologue Song\" on November 7, 2009, in season 35, and used her opportunity as a host to make jokes about what she was best known for in 2009: singing songs about her boyfriends and getting interrupted by Kanye West at the VMAs a few months prior.\n\nBesides her monologue song, she also performed \"You Belong With Me\" and \"Untouchable.\"\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, John's turn at double duty on April 2, 2011, during season 36, was just his second time ever on the show in an official capacity. The first time was during a 1982 episode as a musical guest.\n\nAfter 29 years away from 30 Rock, John made a triumphant return to the \"SNL\" stage. His episode attracted some big names, including cameos from Jake Gyllenhaal, Tom Hanks, Michael Caine, and Carmelo Anthony.\n\nThe legendary singer performed alongside Leon Russell for two songs, \"Hey Ahab\" and \"Monkey Suit,\" and added an encore performance.\n\nLike Elton John before him, Jagger's presence at \"SNL\" during the season 37 finale on May 19, 2012, brought in some big names: Jon Hamm, Steve Martin, the Foo Fighters, Arcade Fire, and Jeff Beck.\n\nHis was a music-heavy episode. The Rolling Stones front-man performed \"The Last Time\" with Arcade Fire, a medley of \"19th Nervous Breakdown\" and \"It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)\" with the Foo Fighters, and \"Tea Party\" alongside Jeff Beck.\n\nAs it was Kristen Wiig's last episode, Arcade Fire also performed a medley of \"She's a Rainbow\" and \"Ruby Tuesday\" to honor the longtime cast member.\n\nMars asked if he \"could be like Timberlake\" on October 20, 2012, during season 38.\n\nMars had appeared as the musical guest two years prior, but this marked the first time he took on hosting duties as well — and like many musicians, Mars chose to do a musical monologue.\n\nHe also performed \"Locked Out of Heaven\" and \"Young Girls.\"\n\nThat same season, Bieber also pulled double duty on February 9, 2013.\n\nHe appeared on the show a few weeks after he released \"Believe Acoustic,\" and he subsequently performed acoustic versions of \"As Long As You Love Me\" and \"Nothing Like Us.\"\n\nCyrus hosted during two distinct eras of her career. Once during \"Bangerz,\" when she was rocking space buns and twerking all the time, and once during the \"Dead Petz\" era when she was only wearing plastic jewelry and neon colors.\n\nCyrus' first appearance on the show was during season 39, on October 5, 2013 — just over a month after her controversial appearance at the VMAs, which earned her backlash for twerking up against Robin Thicke. Of course, she poked fun at the outrage during the show's cold open.\n\nShe went on to perform \"Wrecking Ball\" and an acoustic version of \"We Can't Stop.\"\n\nCyrus returned to \"SNL\" on October 3, 2015, for the season premiere of 41, with a radically different look. This time, she sang \"Karen Don't Be Sad\" and \"The Twinkle Song,\" which brought her to tears.\n\nGaga took on both roles during the November 16, 2013, episode of season 39.\n\nThe native New Yorker brought out R. Kelly for the performance of their song, \"Do What U Want\" — she has since apologized for working with him, per Rolling Stone. She also sang \"Gypsy\" from \"Artpop.\"\n\nDrake is yet another rapper who has performed both duties at \"SNL.\"\n\nHis first \"SNL\" hosting gig came during season 39 (a season heavy on double-duty hosts) on January 18, 2014. He performed a medley of his hits \"Started from the Bottom\" and \"Trophies,\" and he sang his duet with Jhene Aiko, \"From Time.\"\n\nDrake returned for season 41 on May 14, 2016. Chris Rock made a surprise appearance to introduce Drake's first performance, \"One Dance.\" He also sang \"Hype\" — but the highlight of his episode was his sketch, \"Drake's Beef,\" which poked fun at Drake's feud with Meek Mill.\n\nTwo years before he earned the title of People's Sexiest Man Alive, Shelton called himself \"a little troublemakin' cutie\" in his monologue. He also called himself the \"Justin Bieber of country music\" when he hosted on January 24, 2015, during season 40.\n\nThe country star performed \"Neon Light\" and \"Boys 'Round Here.\"\n\nGrande went back to her theater kid roots during her March 12, 2016, episode.\n\nThe singer also poked fun at her Nickelodeon roots alongside fellow Nick alum Kenan Thompson — and had a pretty cute interaction with future ex Pete Davidson — during her monologue.\n\nBesides her musical monologue, she also sang \"Dangerous Woman\" and \"Be Alright.\"\n\nGrande has since returned to the show as the musical guest (March 2024) and as the host (October 2024), but never as both.\n\nGlover hosted, and performed as Childish Gambino, on May 5, 2018.\n\nDuring his monologue, he reminisced on his failed \"SNL\" audition and confused at least a few people by ending it with the customary \"Childish Gambino is here!\"\n\nAs his rapper alter ego, he performed \"This Is America\" and \"Saturday,\" which were introduced by Daniel Kaluuya and Zoë Kravitz, respectively.\n\nAfter performing the year prior, Halsey took on hosting duties as well on February 9, 2019, in season 44.\n\nHalsey gave a shout-out to her home state of New Jersey and praised the female comedians who came before her on the show during her short and sweet monologue.\n\nFor her performances, she sang \"Without Me\" and \"Eastside.\"\n\nChance the Rapper hosted and performed on the October 26, 2019, episode of season 45.\n\nChance was previously a musical guest in 2016 and host in 2017, but he took on both responsibilities during this episode.\n\nThough plenty of people were talking about Jason Momoa's surprise appearance, the rapper held his own during the episode.\n\nCharmingly, he introduced himself in the third person before his first performance, \"Zanies and Fools.\" He also got Megan Thee Stallion to make an appearance during his performance of their song \"Handsome.\"\n\nStyles also pulled double duty during season 45, on the November 16, 2019, episode.\n\nThis was the fifth time Styles performed on \"SNL,\" (twice as a solo act and three times as part of One Direction), but it was the first time he took on hosting duties as well.\n\nAnd though the \"Adore You\" singer had proved his comedic talents in sketches before, nothing could've prepared us for the joy of \"Sara Lee\" or \"Joan Song.\"\n\nStyles also performed \"Lights Up\" and \"Watermelon Sugar\" (the latter introduced by Jon Hamm).\n\nHe'll be back on double duty in season 51 for the episode airing on March 14, 2026.\n\nJonas has appeared three times on \"SNL\" before: twice with the Jonas Brothers in 2009 and 2019, and once as a solo artist in 2016. Like Styles, he had always appeared in at least one sketch, but this was his first time trying his hand at hosting.\n\nThis appearance also kicked off his latest era as a solo artist after the successful comeback of the Jonas Brothers in 2019.\n\nHe performed \"Spaceman\" and \"This Is Heaven,\" introduced by his older brother Kevin on February 27, 2021.\n\nEilish was previously the musical guest for the season 45 premiere on September 28, 2019, with host Woody Harrelson.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, Eilish — then 19 — is only the second-youngest person to both host and perform. The No. 1 spot still goes to Britney Spears, who was just 18 when she pulled it off.\n\nEilish sang \"Happier Than Ever\" and \"Male Fantasy,\" of course accompanied by her brother, Finneas, on December 11, 2021.\n\nLizzo showed off her impressive comedic chops during her season 47 episode on April 16, 2022.\n\nShe poked fun at her equal love of rumors and Chris Evans during her monologue, busted out the flute for her performance of song, \"About Damn Time.\" She also performed \"Special.\"\n\nMegan Thee Stallion was the first person in season 48 to pull double duty, which she did on October 15, 2022.\n\nTwo months after the release of her second album, \"Traumazine,\" the rapper paid a visit to NYC and hosted an episode of \"SNL.\" She performed \"Anxiety\" and a medley of \"NDA\" and \"Plan B.\"\n\nHarlow, fresh off the success of his second album, \"Come Home the Kids Miss You,\" returned to Studio 8H not just to rap but also to host.\n\nAs it was the Halloween episode, Tom Hanks made a highly anticipated cameo to bring back his character David S. Pumpkins, and then stuck around to introduce one of Harlow's performances.\n\nHe performed a medley of \"Lil Secret\" and \"First Class,\" and the song \"State Fair.\"\n\nLipa hosted the show the day after her third album, \"Radical Optimism,\" was released. She performed \"Illusion\" and \"Happy for You,\" which were introduced by Troye Sivan and Jerry Seinfeld, respectively.\n\nCharli XCX, fresh off \"Brat Summer,\" tried her hand at sketch comedy by hosting an episode of \"SNL\" on November 16, 2024.\n\nIn addition to performing \"360\" and \"Sympathy Is a Knife,\" the musician also appeared in the musical Lonely Island Digital Short \"Here I Go.\"\n\nAfter hosting two prior episodes, Chalamet tried his hand at performing live on TV just a few weeks after the release of \"A Complete Unknown,\" in which he plays Bob Dylan.\n\nHe first performed a medley of \"Outlaw Blues\" and \"Three Angels\" accompanied by James Blake on the organ, and then \"Tomorrow Is a Long Time.\" His first performance was introduced by Adam Sandler, closing the loop on a bit first started by Nikki Glaser at the Golden Globes.\n\nCarpenter solidified her comedy chops when she hosted the October 18 episode. She performed \"Manchild\" and \"Nobody's Son\" off her album, \"Man's Best Friend.\"",

    "title": "11 home trends you'll probably regret in a few years, according to interior designers",
    "description": "Interior designers shared popular home trends and decor choices that you'll likely regret because they don't age well or get expensive to replace.",
    "fullText": "Trends come and go, but there are a few you might want to avoid bringing into your home.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to interior designers about which decor choices they think homeowners would be most likely to regret in a few years.\n\nJoe Cangelosi, owner of Joe Cangelosi Design, told BI that marble countertops aren't always the best option — particularly for those who plan to spend a lot of time using their kitchen.\n\n\"They're beautiful, but they also chip and stain easily,\" he said. \"Choose quartz instead — they have options that look just like marble. Or if you want a natural look, choose granite.\"\n\nTrendy patterns and colors are fleeting, but tile can be forever, said Jessica Welling, owner of Jessica Welling Interiors. After all, tile can be really expensive and difficult to replace.\n\n\"I recommend choosing more subdued and neutral-colored tile,\" she said. \"Then, bring in your bold colors and patterns with accent walls, shower curtains, towels, and wall art. These are much easier and less expensive to change out.\"\n\nIf you're set on a trendy patterned tile, you might be better off using it for a small area of backsplash instead of the whole floor or shower, Welling added.\n\nModern furniture can be cheap and convenient to purchase, but pay attention to its measurements, particularly the distance to the ground.\n\n\"Some modern-furniture companies — particularly those from Italy — have seating that is way too low to the ground,\" Cangelosi said.\n\n\"If you or someone you know becomes pregnant, it's virtually impossible to get in or out of the seat without help or rolling to the ground — same thing if you have guests who are elderly or infirm in some way,\" he added.\n\nInstead, look for pieces with a standard 18-inch seat height.\n\nWhite carpet might look clean and classy, but it is nearly impossible to maintain and protect from stains.\n\n\"If you really want that look, skip the wall-to-wall carpeting, get wood floors instead, and get some white area rugs that can be sent out to get cleaned periodically,\" Cangelosi said.\n\nIf you go this route, look for rugs with stain-resistant properties, especially if you have children, pets, or frequent guests.\n\nShiplap, a type of wooden wall siding, had its design moment — but, like many trends, it won't always be in style.\n\n\"Someday in the not-too-distant future, it will look dated. If you've shiplapped your whole house, it's going to be expensive and very time-consuming to change back,\" Welling said said.\n\n\"For those who can't live without shiplap, I recommend installing it on a single accent wall or possibly the fireplace to make a big impact,\" she added. That way, it's easier to remove if you get bored with it.\n\nLisa Modica, owner of Cherry Tree Design Studio, told BI that wood-look laminate flooring wasn't worth installing.\n\n\"It never looks or feels exactly like wood, and it can even get very slippery and dangerous depending on the price point,\" she said. \"Plus, if it gets damaged, it can't be refinished — just replaced.\"\n\nInstead, the designer recommended spending the extra money on real wood floors for better long-term value. If you're looking for a more sustainable option, choose bamboo or reclaimed wood flooring.\n\n\"Step away from the wall-to-wall carpet,\" Modica said. \"Dust, dirt, and allergens all embed themselves into not only the carpet but the padding beneath, where it is impossible to reach.\"\n\nInstead, opt for wood, stone, concrete, or tile floors. You can always achieve a carpet feel with accent rugs.\n\nAlthough open shelving might look nice, it can end up creating more work for you and your guests.\n\n\"No one wants to dust their plates before they use them, and if they are close to the stove, [plates] can collect grease and dirt as well,\" Modica said. \"Plus, if you have cats, you are asking to be woken by a huge crash in the middle of the night.\"\n\nThe designer said cabinets with glass doors are a more practical option for showing off kitchenware while protecting it from excessive grime.\n\nWhen choosing light fixtures, it's essential to consider the height of your ceilings. Low-hanging lights can cause injuries to you or your house guests.\n\n\"You can get away with hanging fixtures a bit lower over kitchen islands and dining tables, but even then, there is a limit,\" Modica said.\n\nIdeally, she said, fixtures should be hung between 7 feet and about 7½ feet from the floor. If they're hanging above a table or counter, they should be no lower than 3 feet above the surface.\n\nJetted tubs can be great to have, but they require a lot of maintenance.\n\n\"They need a ton of water to fill them, and you need to run cleaner through the jets and internal plumbing regularly,\" Modica said. \"A lot of them are also really loud when they run, which is the opposite of the relaxing bath experience you want.\"\n\nIf you really want a comfortable soak, consider purchasing a large, deep tub instead. It's more timeless and much easier to clean.\n\nAlthough it may be having a moment, terrazzo is just another trend to avoid overdoing, said Jennifer Burt, an interior designer and blogger at Mississippi Maximalism.\n\nTerrazzo — which consists of small chips of materials like marble and granite set in concrete — has become more prevalent in recent years.\n\n\"It is gorgeous, but a way to avoid regretting the trend is to invest in accessories, like planters made of terrazzo, instead of installing floors or countertops,\" she said.\n\nThis story was originally published on September 1, 2021, and most recently updated on February 23, 2026.",

    "title": "Career tips for creators from 5 of Steve Jobs' friends, including Tim Cook, Jony Ive, and Bob Iger",
    "description": "Steve Jobs’ legacy is celebrated by friends like Tim Cook, Jony Ive, and Bob Iger sharing their insights in \"Letters to a Young Creator.\"",
    "fullText": "Late Apple cofounder Steve Jobs had a variety of powerful friends, and they're honoring his legacy by sharing their recipes for success.\n\nTo celebrate his birthday on Tuesday, the Steve Jobs Archive released two collections of letters from business leaders, designers, writers, and more.\n\nThe entries were originally distributed to 2023 and 2024 fellows of the SJA program for young creators, and they've been compiled into two volumes titled \"Letters to a Young Creator.\"\n\nThe volumes feature the words of advice from tech trailblazers like Tim Cook and Jony Ive, to successful businessmen Bob Iger and Arthur Rock, to creative minds like Pixar's Pete Docter and filmmaker Jon Chu.\n\nSome wove their lessons together with personal anecdotes about their relationships with Jobs, while others laid out lists to aid in the creative process.\n\nTuesday would've been Jobs' 71st birthday. The former Apple CEO died in 2011 after living with pancreatic cancer for a number of years. Jobs became known for his inspirational public speeches and quotes shared by those who worked closely with him.\n\nVolume one of \"Letters To a Young Creator\" ends with an email Jobs sent to himself in 2010. In the note, he reflected on how his appreciation for human creativity.\n\n\"I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being,\" Jobs wrote.\n\nIn volume two, Jobs referred to himself in a 1984 quote as a student.\n\n\"Don't take it all too seriously,\" he concluded.\n\nHere's what his friends had to say about pursuing success as a young creator.\n\nCook took over as CEO in 2011 after Jobs stepped down to focus on his health. Before his death, the pair worked closely together at Apple. Cook has been with the company since he met Jobs in 1998.\n\nIn his 2024 letter, Cook described the fateful meeting that led to a decadeslong career at one of the biggest tech companies in the world. He said he was warned against taking a job at Apple as the company had been struggling around that time. One conversation with Jobs changed everything.\n\n\"I had never met someone with so much passion and vision,\" Cook wrote. \"I knew I had to be a part of it.\"\n\nHis advice to young creators facing similar decisions on their future career paths was to ask themselves one question.\n\n\"And so when you imagine your future, and the winding path that is laid before you, remember the question you should ask is not 'What will happen?' but 'Who will I be when it does?'\" Cook said.\n\nIve, Apple's former design chief, worked with Jobs for nearly 15 years. The pair would often have lunch together as they came up with ideas that led to successful products like the iPhone.\n\nIve wrote about his relationship with Jobs.\n\n\"His insatiable curiosity was not limited or distracted by his knowledge or expertise, nor was it casual or passive,\" Ive wrote. \"It was ferocious, energetic, and restless.\"\n\nIve and Jobs connected over their shared curiosity. He encouraged people to be like Jobs and show their admiration for humans by being creators themselves. According to Ive, Jobs was focused on ideas rather than the problems that come along with them.\n\n\"Ideas are fragile. If they were resolved, they would not be ideas, they would be products. It takes determined effort not to be consumed by the problems of a new idea,\" Ive wrote.\n\nDocter is the chief creative officer at Pixar, which Jobs owned before Apple's comeback. In recent years, Docter has been vocal about the intersection of tech and animation, saying artificial intelligence won't fully replace humans in filmmaking.\n\nHe's known for directing hit animated movies like \"Monsters, Inc.,\" \"Up,\" \"Inside Out,\" and \"Soul.\"\n\nDocter laid out nine tips that he uses in his own creative process. Here are three of them:\n\nIger has had two stints as Disney's CEO, starting in 2005. The media giant acquired Pixar in 2006. Jobs became a member of Disney's board of directors as part of the deal.\n\nIn true Disney fashion, Iger wrote about \"magic and wonder\" in his letter to creators. He remarked that creativity can't be reduced to math or science.\n\nBeing risk-averse, he said, is the \"death of creativity.\"\n\n\"Second-guessing creative decisions is a perilous endeavor. Learn from creative mistakes, and never second-guess why things were made,\" Iger wrote. \"Instead, ask how they could have been made better.\"\n\nRock is an iconic Silicon Valley investor behind Intel, Xerox, and Apple. The 99-year-old wrote his 2025 letter about what makes a good leader.\n\n\"A good leader chooses good people,\" he said.\n\nExecution outweighs ideas, according to Rock, and finding people who can execute is essential. It's the traits that money can't buy, like \"fire in the belly,\" that Rock learned to identify throughout his decades as a venture capitalist.\n\n\"You want people who know what they can do, and do it. Even more important: You want people who know what they don't know,\" Rock said.",

    "description": "As of February, CEO Sam Altman had 10 direct reports, while CEO of applications Fidji Simo had 13.",
    "fullText": "Who's in charge at one of the most powerful companies in the world?\n\nAs OpenAI races toward an expected IPO, faces mounting pressure to justify its valuation, and tries to fend off its Big Tech rivals, a small circle of executives and researchers is steering the ChatGPT maker through a defining moment.\n\nTo map the power players shaping OpenAI's future, Business Insider looked at the upper ranks of the company's internal organizational chart.\n\nAs of February, CEO Sam Altman had 10 direct reports, including Greg Brockman, president and cofounder; Chief Scientist Jakub Pachocki; and Chief Research Officer Mark Chen.\n\nIn August, Fidji Simo officially joined as the CEO of applications and began reporting to Altman. Simo, the former CEO of Instacart and Facebook app lead at Meta, heads up the company's consumer and enterprise product lines. She's been tasked with scaling the business into a revenue-generating powerhouse.\n\nSince she joined the company, OpenAI has rolled out ads and numerous updates to its enterprise product.\n\nSimo had 13 direct reports, according to the February org chart, including the head of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, and Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Friar. Some of Simo's reports, including Turley, previously reported to Altman.\n\nBarret Zoph, the general manager of B2B, rejoined the company in January and began reporting to Simo. Zoph left OpenAI in February 2025 to help found Thinking Machine Labs alongside former OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati.\n\nBoth Altman and Simo also have administrative staffers who report directly to them.\n\nExecutive shifts at OpenAI are often fast-moving, and its org chart can be fluid. Last week, Instagram's head of partnerships, Charles Porch, announced he had joined OpenAI. Vanity Fair reported that Porch, who is known for bringing celebrities to Instagram, would work directly with Simo.\n\nAltman also announced earlier this month that the company is bringing on Peter Steinberger, the man behind the viral AI agent social media network OpenClaw.\n\nThe number of direct reports isn't necessarily reflective of overall team size. Simo manages nearly two-thirds of the company, according to a source familiar with the structure.\n\nDane Stuckey, the chief information security officer, has more than 20 of his own direct reports, and Peter Welinder, who works on the company's hardware device, has more than 50.\n\nMost of Altman's other direct reports have around a dozen of their own reports.\n\nDo you work for OpenAI or have a tip?

    "description": "The startup is trying to transform its Claude AI model from a coding tool into a much broader workplace technology platform.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic is pushing deeper into the enterprise, embedding its AI model Claude directly into the workplace software employees use every day.\n\nOn Tuesday, the AI startup unveiled \"Cowork & Plugins for the Enterprise,\" a package of AI tools that get Claude operating inside popular work applications, such as Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint. Instead of copying answers from a chatbot into spreadsheets or slide decks, users can now run Claude directly inside those applications, with the system carrying context between programs.\n\n\"Until now, enterprise AI has followed a persistent pattern: you go to the AI, get an answer, then go back to your actual tools to do the work,\" Anthropic wrote in its announcement on Tuesday. \"Now, Claude works inside the tools knowledge workers already use — Excel, PowerPoint, Slack — not as a separate window, but as part of how work actually gets done.\"\n\nThe launch signals Anthropic's clearest attempt yet to challenge Microsoft and OpenAI for control of the digital workplace in the era of AI.\n\nMicrosoft has embedded its own 365 Copilot tool across Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams, while also offering Copilot Studio for enterprises to build custom AI agents. OpenAI, meanwhile, launched Frontier earlier this month, a platform built on its ChatGPT enterprise offerings. Google has integrated its Gemini AI throughout Gmail and its Workplace applications. Amazon also offers a similar service called Quick Suite.\n\nAnthropic is hoping to position itself as the default operational layer across enterprise workflows.\n\nAt the center of the launch are customizable \"plugins,\" or specialized AI agents configured for roles including financial analysis, design, operations, and HR.\n\nAnthropic said the plugins are open-source and portable, allowing companies to modify and deploy them without being locked into a single ecosystem. Several were co-developed with partners, including FactSet, S&P, and Slack.\n\nThe AI startup is also rolling out a slate of new connectors to platforms such as Google Drive, Gmail, and DocuSign, enabling Claude to access live enterprise data with administrative controls. Enterprises can create private plugin marketplaces and manage access at scale.\n\nAnthropic said customers, including L'Oréal, Deloitte, and Thomson Reuters, have already built specialized AI agents using Claude to automate workflows and accelerate internal processes.\n\nWith this launch, Anthropic is making clear that it no longer wants to be known primarily as a tool for developers. It wants Claude embedded across the enterprise, supporting finance teams, HR departments, analysts, and executives alike.\n\n\"In 2025, Claude Code transformed how software gets built,\" Anthropic said in Tuesday's announcement. \"In 2026, we're bringing that transformation to all knowledge work.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "I made hot and iced lattes with chai concentrates from Good & Gather, Oregon Chai, Trader Joe's, Rishi, and Tazo to find the best at-home chai latte.",
    "fullText": "Chai lattes can be tricky to get right since a tasty one needs to balance sweetness and spice. So, I usually just order them from cafés rather than making them at home.\n\nHowever, there are a lot of easy-to-prepare chai concentrates available for days when I'm home and craving a hot tea in the morning or a refreshing iced latte on a warm afternoon.\n\nSo, I tried chai concentrate from five different brands — Good & Gather, Oregon Chai, Trader Joe's, Rishi, and Tazo — to see how they compare when prepared hot and iced.\n\nHere's how they stacked up and which made my favorite chai drinks.\n\nI usually expect some spice in a chai beverage, but Good & Gather's iced chai had just the faintest aftertaste of black pepper.\n\nThe drink, when hot, mostly tasted like sweetened tea. It wasn't particularly heavy in cream or syrup and just tasted a bit watery.\n\nI expected the iced versions of these lattes to lose some of their potency, and that was definitely the case for the Good & Gather chai.\n\nIts hint of black pepper and sweet taste were almost entirely lost when I combined the concentrate and milk over ice. It wasn't bad, but it turned out pretty bland.\n\nI hadn't tried the Oregon Chai brand before, but it looked promising. The label noted its rich and authentic flavors, featuring black tea, spices, and honey for sweetness.\n\nThis container, also 32 ounces, was originally $5, making it about 16 cents an ounce. I got it on sale for $4.\n\nSimilar to Tazo's and Rishi's containers, this design seemed better suited for stocking shelves than pouring.\n\nIt poured out messily as I combined 4 ounces of this concentrate with equal parts milk.\n\nI thought the resulting iced latte from Oregon Chai was simply fine: cold and a little sweet.\n\nIt was refreshing on a hot day, but overall, the flavor was quite bland to me. The earthiness was a little more present, but there was little sweetness and no spice.\n\nThe spiced chai concentrate from Trader Joe's was unique for a lot of reasons.\n\nIt came in a bottle rather than a boxy container, and was the smallest at only 16 ounces, half the size of the other four I tested.\n\nThe rest of the concentrates I tried called for a 1:1 ratio of chai to milk, but this one called for 1 part chai to 2 parts milk. So, I decided to use 4 ounces of the concentrate to 8 ounces of milk.\n\nThis concentrate was the cheapest upfront at $2.80 — but, broken down, it was 18 cents per ounce.\n\nI still combined the 4 ounces of concentrate with 8 ounces of milk for the iced version of the Trader Joe's chai. I found that the addition of ice really balanced out the concentrate.\n\nThe result was a tea with a more balanced profile, since the melting ice helped tame all the spice. I actually ended up loving the Trader Joe's concentrate when combined with milk and ice.\n\nI judged the book by its cover with Rishi, which came in a gorgeously designed container.\n\nIt cost $6 — on sale for $4.80 — for the 32-ounce package. At 19 cents an ounce before the sale, this was pricier than the other brands I tested.\n\nThis concentrate called for a 1:1 concentrate-to-milk ratio, so I used 4 ounces of chai with 4 ounces of milk for both hot and iced, as with most of the previous drinks.\n\nBetween the container's shape and the liquid's consistency, this concentrate was the messiest to serve. It kept spilling out as I tried to pour it.\n\nDespite thoroughly shaking the concentrate, some gritty spice particles ended up floating in the drink — this hadn't been noticeable in its hot counterpart.\n\nThe cinnamon flavor also worked better when served warm, so overall, this iced drink tasted average to me.\n\nI've purchased Tazo's chai concentrate a few times in the past and enjoyed it, but I hadn't realized how pricey it was upfront compared to some other brands.\n\nThis 32-ounce concentrate rang up at $5.19, the most expensive one I tried after sales were factored in. Still, it ultimately cost me 16 cents an ounce, keeping it on par with the other options.\n\nI followed the same one-to-one ratio when preparing the Tazo chai.\n\nI really enjoyed the hot Tazo chai latte. It wasn't too sweet, and the spice was forward, but not overwhelming.\n\nThe concentrate and milk combined to create a creamy consistency rather than a watery texture. This was my favorite hot chai that I tested.\n\nAlthough Tazo took the spot for best hot chai latte, it wasn't my favorite iced chai drink.\n\nIt was delicious, with sweetness and a hint of spice, but I found the super-strong Trader Joe's concentrate was perfect with ice. This one lost some of its flavor, but was my second-favorite iced drink.\n\nThe Tazo concentrate had a perfect blend of spices and sweetness that came through when hot, resulting in a nice, creamy latte. However, a lot of its flavor was subdued when added to cold milk and ice.\n\nAlthough I wasn't a fan of the Trader Joe's chai concentrate when prepared hot, I loved it with cold milk over ice. The extremely strong spices in the concentrate overpowered the other flavors when served warm, but they held up well to ice and offered a much better flavor.\n\nAll of these chai concentrates were good, and I wouldn't mind buying any of them again. However, Tazo is my preferred brand for a hot chai latte, and I'll have to stop at Trader Joe's if I'm craving one iced.\n\nThis story was originally published on May 18, 2023, and most recently updated on February 24, 2026.",

    "description": "The rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage dropped to a multiyear low on Monday. Investors have flocked to safe havens amid fresh fears about the trade war.",
    "fullText": "Mortgage rates dipped below a key threshold this week. That could be a boon for Donald Trump's affordability push, but it's not necessarily for the reason the president wants.\n\nThe average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage in the US dropped to 5.99% on Monday, per the Mortgage News Daily Rate Index. That's the lowest borrowing costs have been for prospective home buyers since 2022. The decline has been driven by the latest decrease in Treasury yields.\n\nHowever, rather than pricing in lower rates in the medium-term, which is what Trump wants to see, government bond yields have dropped because investors are freaked out again about the trade war.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year US Treasury declined in the days since the Supreme Court struck down most of Trump's tariffs, dropping five basis points on Monday alone.\n\nThe president's response to the ruling that he would initiate a new global tariff of 15% has reignited investors' fears about the trade war.\n\nThough most of Trump's tariffs have been struck down, the prospect of a 15% universal tariff, combined with the sell-off in tech driven by AI in recent weeks, has caused investors to flee to safety.\n\nJPMorgan said on Monday that the risk-off move has caused yields to spike. Investors are grasping for safe havens amid a new cocktail of market worries, David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, told Business Insider, pointing to the concurrent rise in hedges like gold. The metal is up about 4% in the last five days.\n\nThe 10-year yield has plummeted to its lowest levels so far this year, and now looks \"very close\" to its low in April 2025, around the time Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs sparked investor panic and a historical sell-off, according to Nicholas Colas, the co-founder of DataTrek Research.\n\n\"We are, in other words, in pretty unusual territory,\" Colas wrote in a recent note.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "title": "I moved to Spain without even knowing basic Spanish. It's been a challenging year, but I hope to stick around.",
    "description": "As an American English speaker who moved to Spain without knowing Spanish, I've had some challenges. Still, a year later, I'm glad I moved here.",
    "fullText": "After visiting Spain several times, I'd absolutely fallen in love with the country. By late 2024, I'd decided to leave the US and move there.\n\nPerhaps I should've been worried since I had no friends or family in the country, and I didn't speak the local language — even basic phrases such as \"¿Cómo estás?\" and \"¿Cómo te llamas?\" were far beyond my scope.\n\nI just figured everything would work itself out, and it mostly has. However, the past year (and change) since I moved has been complicated.\n\nBeing an English speaker in a place where Spanish is the primary language has made me feel like I'm a toddler again, living in a world where everyone holds the magic keys of words … except for me.\n\nDespite everything, though, I don't regret my move.\n\nMy first hurdle? Finding and renting an apartment.\n\nDespite having started Spanish classes at a school near my hotel two weeks before I decided to move, I still had no meaningful language skills.\n\nSo, I initiated my apartment search via email and text, using Google Translate to send and decode any messages with potential landlords.\n\nUnfortunately, I only got one response from my search. Fortunately, that apartment was perfect.\n\nLocated in the heart of Seville's Historic Center, it came complete with a little balcony, high ceilings, marble floors, and a small interior courtyard filled with plants cascading down from the railings.\n\nUsing Google Translate, I told the agent that I wanted it, and she asked if I was sure I didn't have any questions.\n\nI said I didn't even though I probably had a few — you'd be amazed at how quickly a language barrier can knock the desire to ask questions right out of you.\n\nThe rental agency sent me a contract I couldn't understand. So, the bilingual staff at my hotel sat with me, translating and reviewing it line by line. They even called the rental agency on my behalf for a few needed clarifications. It sounded good enough, and I signed.\n\nOther big jumps came early as well. With my language school's help, I navigated the visa paperwork, opened a bank account, and signed up for medical insurance.\n\nI wasn't completely sure what I was signing at any given moment, but I was never too intimidated because I had people walking me through each step. However, support isn't always readily available.\n\nIn the months that followed my move, I relied heavily on pointing and gesturing — but there are times when that won't do you any good.\n\nThough my Spanish lessons continued, I was still ages away from being able to hold a conversation. I found myself sticking with the least complicated option in almost every situation, from restaurants to salons.\n\nFor example, if I needed a haircut, I'd keep it simple by just getting a trim. That way, \"trim\" was the only word I needed to translate and memorize before my visit.\n\nEven the most mundane things, such as purchasing cleaning supplies, would leave me feeling lost.\n\nI couldn't tell disinfectant from glass cleaner or check which product was safe for which surface without pulling out my phone to slowly translate the back of the bottles.\n\nDoctor's visits were harder for me to simplify. Navigating medical appointments is challenging enough in my native language, let alone in a foreign one.\n\nI'm still not entirely sure how to explain symptoms with precision or clearly understand what a doctor is saying back to me. I worry about the nuances that can get lost in translation.\n\nWhile all of the above can be managed, what remains the most frustrating is stumbling through what should be ordinary, spontaneous conversations.\n\nI can't give someone a compliment in passing when I'm missing the one phrase I need. If a neighbor's dog dies and I want to share something kind and meaningful, I have to wait until I can look up how to say it.\n\nClearing up a simple misunderstanding with a waiter? Forget it, I don't have those words yet.\n\nMost frustratingly, in these small, friendly neighborhoods, I see many of the same faces every day. People want to say more than hello to me, and I feel the same.\n\nMy Spanish is rough, but I still try. Simple conversations are beginning to get a tiny bit easier to navigate — but topics can't be stretched beyond the ordinary, and that invariably leads to frustration.\n\nFortunately, many locals have been patient, helpful, and understanding as I've picked up more Spanish.\n\nHowever, there's a limit to the time others have to spend guessing what you're trying to say, and even an octopus wouldn't have enough \"arms\" to charade itself into meaningful communication.\n\nLanguage barriers can be challenging to navigate, and it can feel lonely not to understand so much. Should you make a similar move to mine, you might feel isolated at times.\n\nI do think adapting has been a little easier for me since I'm solitary by nature. However, I know a lot of people really struggle with the isolation and resort to sticking with English-speaking expat groups instead of trying to connect with locals.\n\nI haven't. I chose Spain because I like Spain and its people. I look forward to when I'm able to know them better.\n\nThis adventure has been frustrating at times, but it's been well worth the effort. Even with the language barrier, it still feels like home.",

    "description": "As a new father, I hear many people talk about screen time and how much children should have. But I try to find valuable content for my kids to watch.",
    "fullText": "I didn't know what chocolate ganache was before watching reruns of an old Food Network pre-teen baking championship with my kids. But I did spot an opportunity to talk with them about how one contestant kept building her cake after it crumbled. We talked about the word perseverance.\n\nThat's the thing about \"screen time\" as a modern parenting panic: the same rectangle can either be a sedative or a springboard.\n\nBut my wife and I are still fairly new at this — our kids are under 5 — so we talk with other parents about evolving opinions on the use of phones, tablets, computers, and TVs.\n\nFrom those conversations and our own parenting experience, we're slowly realizing that it's not about screen time, but more about what type of content we're letting our kids watch.\n\nMy wife, kids, and I live in a Philadelphia rowhome. We've kept TV out of our bedrooms and devices out of our daily routine. On trips in the car, bus, and subway, we rely on music and games (I've come to loathe \"I spy\").\n\nIn good weather, we enjoy long walks and frequent visits to our neighborhood rec center. Forced into boredom at home, our kids have developed their own imagined worlds: singing karaoke on the couch, lava-ringed obstacle courses, and preparing elaborate meals in a play kitchen.\n\nBut especially on freezing days, when you're stuck indoors, and everyone's energy is somehow both too high and already spent, screens help. What's become clear to me is that a screen's value depends on what we watch.\n\nIn recent years, the global discourse has turned aggressively anti-screen.\n\nGovernments are now intervening not just in social media but in screens more broadly. France, for example, has prohibited screen exposure for kids under 3 in childcare settings, and Virginia has moved to make schools \"cell phone-free.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the American Academy of Pediatrics has long advocated against the simplistic yardstick of screen time, noting there isn't enough evidence for a single universal time limit, emphasizing family context and habits instead.\n\nIt seems to me that no one can agree on what the maximum screen time should be for children, so that's why I'm focusing less on time and more on the content.\n\nWatching a kids' baking show as a family, especially when we can connect the events to our own lives, can be healthy. I've seen the positive effects of a great show on my own kids.\n\nFor parents of young kids, the difference between cartoons like \"Bluey\" and \"Cocomelon\" is obvious: In one, characters develop over seven to 10 minutes, and in the other, brightly colored, computer-animated characters sing hypnotically rhythmic songs in short bursts.\n\nThis holds true for older kids, too. With the right guardrails, I think that screens can be genuinely social and developmental, like collaborating with friends in a shared Minecraft world, building a Roblox obstacle course over a week, or editing a goofy video together that takes planning and patience.\n\nI see \"good\" screen time often involves characters, cause-and-effect, enough plot for us to talk about it together, and a bonus for when it's social. I don't see why there should be a time limit on any of that.",

    "fullText": "I've been to all 50 states — most several times — and the places that stay with me aren't the big cities.\n\nRather, they're the small towns I stumbled into on long road trips, the places locals insisted I \"had to see,\" and the destinations I only meant to pass through but ended up daydreaming about long after I left.\n\nAfter years of crisscrossing the country, I've realized that much of America's real magic lives in its small towns. Here are five I can't stop thinking about\n\nKennebunkport, Maine, is one of those coastal towns I keep returning to, no matter how many new places I visit.\n\nI've been several times, and each trip reminds me why it's such a favorite — wide, sandy beaches, peaceful inlets that are perfect for kayaking, and that unmistakable Maine charm.\n\nAnd of course, no visit is complete without a classic lobster roll from Mabel's Lobster Claw.\n\nBayfield, Wisconsin, is the gateway to the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, where I've spent hours hiking forested trails and wandering quiet, wild islands.\n\nIn town, a visit to Copper Crow Distillery, the first Indigenous-owned distillery in US, is a must-visit. And dinner downtown at the stylish and historic St. James Social is the perfect way to end a day exploring this charming lakeside town.\n\nAs a Colorado local, Telluride remains my favorite mountain town. Nestled in a stunning canyon surrounded by towering peaks, it combines dramatic scenery with a laid-back, small-town vibe that's hard to beat.\n\nThe free gondola ride offers stunning views of the town (and the San Juan Mountains) from above, and makes getting around town effortless. Plus, in my opinion, the nearby hiking trails are some of the best in the state, ranging from alpine trails to hidden waterfalls.\n\nThe restaurants are top-notch, and the town's remoteness only adds to its charm.\n\nHomer, Alaska, is a beautiful four-and-a-half-hour drive from Anchorage. Although it's easy enough to travel to, visiting feels like being worlds away.\n\nI love wandering the harbor and the \"Homer Spit,\" a long, thin stretch of land reaching into Kachemak Bay. Here, I enjoy watching the fishing boats come and go, and hiking the nearby trails.\n\nStaying right on the water makes mornings feel slow and calm, and the town's laid-back charm shows up in every coffee shop and gallery I visit.\n\nFrom fresh seafood to iconic local spots like the Salty Dawg Saloon — which is famously covered with dollar bills on the ceiling and walls — Homer somehow feels wild and welcoming at the same time.\n\nAbiquiu is a small town with a big personality — where art, history, and adventure converge in unexpected ways.\n\nThe landscape in Abiquiu, New Mexico, inspired many of Georgia O'Keeffe's works, and I can definitely see why. For example, hiking or taking a horseback riding tour at Ghost Ranch is unforgettable, with red cliffs and sweeping mesas around every turn.\n\nI love starting my morning with a breakfast burrito from the historic Bode's General Store, and ending the day with dinner at Café Abiquiu.",

So we're not planning on a lot.\"\n\nHome Depot and its rival Lowe's, which reports earnings Wednesday, have both navigated the stretch of uncertainty with discipline, and both retailers' stock prices were up Tuesday following Home Depot's results.\n\n\"Hopefully we're bouncing along the bottom of turnover,\" Decker said of the housing market.",

    "title": "I'm a New Yorker who went to Vancouver for the first time. 7 things surprised me.",
    "description": "My first trip to Vancouver, British Columbia, was full of surprises, from the lush forests to the floating gas station.",
    "fullText": "When I landed in Vancouver after a six-hour flight, I followed fellow passengers through the international terminal to customs. On the way, we walked through a room that made me stop in my tracks. It looked like a museum exhibit.\n\nKnown as the Pacific Passage, this room was designed by AldrichPears Associates to immerse visitors in the natural wonders of British Columbia upon arrival.\n\nAs I entered, I was entranced by the soundtracks of waves crashing and birds chirping through the overhead speaker. The room had a forest scene on the left, a body of water on the right, and sculptures by indigenous artists on display — a canoe in the water and a gigantic thunderbird suspended in the air, among others.\n\nI've grown accustomed to a lifestyle with limited access to nature in New York. We have plenty of parks, but the skyscrapers and bustling streets dominate the landscape. I long for more natural escapes within my city, but I always assumed the lack of them was the price you pay for a convenient, urban lifestyle.\n\nThat's not the case in Vancouver. From the downtown area to the quieter surrounding neighborhoods, various tree types stood as tall as the buildings, if not taller. There was no shortage of shade, and looking over the city from hilltops and hotel balconies, I could see how forests were embedded throughout the skyline.\n\nAfter seeing Vancouver's forests from a distance, I wanted a closer look. So I wandered Stanley Park and Jericho Beach Park. From the trails, it was easy to forget I was in the middle of a major city.\n\nHiking from one neighborhood to the next rather than walking through the developed streets was a scenic route I never expected to find.\n\nI spent my first night at the Fairmont Hotel Vancouver, a historic hotel that looks like a castle.\n\nI had stayed in a similar Fairmont in the past, Fairmont Le Château Frontenac in Quebec City, where the castle-like structure matched the old-world European-style town. But I was surprised by the Vancouver hotel's location in the middle of the downtown area in a busy city.\n\nThe Fairmont Hotel Vancouver looked like a medieval relic next to modern skyscrapers.\n\nI spent my second night in Vancouver at the Fairmont Pacific Rim, which overlooks Coal Harbour. From my balcony room on the 21st floor, I was astonished to spot a Chevron gas station in the water.\n\nInstalled in 2010, the Chevron Legacy is the only gas station for boats in the harbor. Its placement made sense, since I saw a marina full of yachts nearby, but I'd never previously thought about how boats fuel up.\n\nNYC's Billionaires' Row is world-famous for its ultra-luxury residential buildings with glass facades that tower over Central Park. Vancouver's Billionaires' Row looks vastly different.\n\nThe elite Belmont Avenue in the West Point Grey neighborhood is home to some of the most expensive real estate in the city, including a 10-bedroom, 16-bathroom mansion valued at roughly $72 million, Coast Reporter reported in January 2025.\n\nA 20-minute drive from downtown, Belmont Avenue is lined with mansions with large lots and ocean views. During my visit, I spotted a range of architectural styles, from Victorian to modern.\n\nThe most surprising part of these properties was the landscaping. Perfectly trimmed trees, bushes, and hedges stood above vibrant flower beds. They looked like grounds you'd find at a European palace.\n\nI love living in New York, but don't plan to stay here forever. I've always thought that whenever I decided to leave the city for a place with more space and nature, I'd end up somewhere that left me longing for the urban lifestyle.\n\nBut visiting Vancouver made me realize I can have it all — the mountains, the hikes, and the bustling city streets. On the day of my departure, I daydreamed about what my life would be like if I moved there. And one day, I just might.",

    "fullText": "The Mac Mini is having a moment thanks to the OpenClaw AI agent. And, in a new development, AI enthusiasts in America can now expect a made-in-the-USA version of Apple's small computer.\n\nThe tech giant announced Tuesday that it would be significantly expanding its factory operations to bring some production of the Mac Mini to the US for the first time. Beginning later this year, Mac Mini units will be produced at a new factory at Apple's existing Houston manufacturing site to help fulfill US orders.\n\nThe company said it will also expand advanced its AI server manufacturing at the Houston factory, an effort that it expects to create thousands of job. It's in line with Apple's previous commitment to invest $600 billion into its US facilities and create 20,000 jobs over the next four years.\n\n\"Apple is deeply committed to the future of American manufacturing, and we're proud to significantly expand our footprint in Houston with the production of Mac Mini starting later this year,\" said Apple CEO Tim Cook.\n\nThere's been some hype around the Mac Mini in 2026, as people seek to operate OpenClaw, an open-source autonomous AI agent. The buzzy AI project has renewed interest in the Mac Mini. It's currently produced in Asia, with many models being listed as Vietnam-made. Overseas production of the computer will continue.\n\nApple's 20,000-square-foot advanced manufacturing center is under construction in Houston, and it will be a site where students, supplier employees, and American businesses can receive hands-on training in the company's manufacturing techniques.\n\nIn its announcement, Apple shouted out several milestones its hit since its $600 billion pledge, including sourcing more that 20 billion US-made chips across 12 states, opening its Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit, and being on track to purchase more than 100 million advanced chips produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company at its Arizona facility.\n\nThe Mac Mini announcement is the latest example of Apple leaning into made-in-the-USA messaging and efforts, as Cook navigates a political balancing act in his relationship with President Donald Trump. As a consumer electronics company that sources much of production overseas, Trump's trade tariffs have cost Apple billions in costs in recent quarters. The tech giant has made tweaks to its supply chain, shifting much of the production of US-bound iPhones to India, for example, as part of its efforts to mitigate the tariff impact.",

    "fullText": "A top statistician and markets commentator thinks more pain is coming from the AI-fueled wave of panic that's shaken the tech sector.\n\nNassim Taleb, the author of \"The Black Swan\" and an advisor at Universa Investments, said he believes the disruption will materially affect software firms and will \"definitely\" lead to bankruptcies in the space.\n\nMoreover, Taleb predicts that the gains among the market leaders of the last few years will be erased as the next crop of winners emerge.\n\n\"The previous rally we had was driven by a very small number of names. And now we'll probably have some broadening effects and redistribution, but a lot of the gains in the stock market are going to be eradicated by that,\" he said in an interview on Bloomberg TV.\n\nThe AI scare trade has been in full focus lately as new AI products and updates pummel software stocks. The sell-off in recent weeks has also spilled over to sectors ike trucking, wealth management, and insurers.\n\nTaleb used a historical analogy to further illustrate his take on the tech sector, noting that pioneering companies are not necessarily the most successful in the long run. He cited the automotive and airline industries as examples, as well as the original PC makers.\n\n\"I'm sure someone's going to make a lot of money in both software and hardware related to AI, but [that] doesn't necessarily have to be these companies because you have a lot of instability,\" Taleb added.\n\nAs Black Swan events are, by definition, phenomena that no one sees coming, Taleb could not speculate on what the next one will be. However, that doesn't mean he believes the US market isn't facing major risk as AI disruption continues.\n\nTaleb said that while the market may be behaving as if extreme crashes are unlikely, this isn't the case, and investors shouldn't be lulled into a false sense of security.\n\n\"I would say the tail risks across all sectors are underpriced,\" he said. \"So it's not the risk of drawdown in the stock market, it's a risk of large drawdown.\"",

    "description": "Investors worried that AI will upend the list of winners and losers in markets should look at these internet stocks that are insulated from disruption.",
    "fullText": "AI has gone from Wall Street's favorite trade to bearish catalyst in short order, but not everyone on Wall Street is convinced the panic is warranted.\n\nAfter a viral note from Citrini Research painting a grim picture of a future shaped by AI tanked the market on Monday, Jefferies analysts wrote on Tuesday that they see the ongoing sell-off as unjustified.\n\nInternet stocks have been among the hardest hit, with the S&P Internet Select Industry Index down more than 15% since the start of 2026. While sentiment is negative, Jefferies said that they see the tech subsector as insulated from the panic, and flagged six stocks in particular that are positioned to break out once Wall Street stops erupting in panic with every new AI update.\n\n\"We see two major obstacles to Internet disintermediation: (1) platforms would need to willingly provide the underlying service/ supply for the LLMs; (2) consumer behavior would need to change,\" they wrote.\n\nJefferies explained that they see AI as a potential tailwind for consumer internet stocks, with AI powering better recommendation engines, reduced customer service costs, and improved product velocity, but it will take time for Wall Street to see this perspective.\n\n\"We recommend owning names the market is likely to identify as possessing structural barriers to AI disintermediation, which are likely to outperform first once sentiment improves.\"\n\nHere are six stocks that Jefferies says fit this playbook and quotes from management the analysts say demonstrate the company's ability to weather disruption.\n\nAirbnb stock is down 7% this year.\n\nCEO Brian Chesky said during the company's most recent earnings call that integrating AI into the company's offerings will create a customer experience that is \"impossible to replicate.\"\n\n\"A chatbot can give you a list of homes, but it can't give you the unique ones you find on Airbnb. A chatbot doesn't have our 200 million verified identities or our 500 million proprietary reviews, and it can't message the hosts, which 90% of our guests do. It can't provide global payment processing, customer support, or insurance,\" he added.\n\nCarvana stock has lost 22% in 2026, but Jefferies sees a handful of signs it's in a good spot amid the AI-induced rotation.\n\nCEO Ernie Garcia III highlighted the financing, logistics, and reconditioning parts of the business as protected from AI in the near term.\n\n\"We think that competitively we're incredibly well positioned compared to the rest of our industry. And we think that our business itself is also positioned, to be an AI winner and not something that is disrupted by AI,\" Garcia said on Carvana's earnings call.\n\nDoorDash CEO Tony Xu says that DoorDash is well-positioned despite AI replacement worries.\n\nOn DoorDash's recent earnings call, the CEO said, \"I think DoorDash is really well-positioned because we're actually solving the end-to-end job for a customer, which is to get them some item brought to them in the condition they expect on time every time. That's actually really hard to do. You got to map the physical world, all of which — that information does not exist anywhere on the internet. That's data that DoorDash has to collect in a proprietary way...So the end-to-end job at the end of the day, I think is how customers will ultimately judge where they do their shopping.\"\n\nThe stock is down 28% year to date.\n\nDisney stock has declined more than 7% since the start of 2026.\n\nThe media giant recently announced a deal with OpenAI's Sora, which CEO Bob Iger says will allow the company to better curate short-form video for their streaming services.\n\nIger told investors, \"We view AI as having a number of obviously possible advantages or opportunities for the company. One is as a tool to help the creative process, so creativity. Another is productivity, which is simply being more efficient. And the third I'll call connectivity, which is creating basically a more intimate relationship with the consumer, enabling the consumer and enabling us with the consumer just to have a more engaged more effective relationship.\"\n\nJefferies analysts highlighted comments from Roku CEO Anthony Wood that outline his view that AI is \"very positive\" for the company.\n\n\"We view it as a powerful tailwind to our business. It's not a disruptor for us and we're integrating it across our entire technology stack. We're applying AI across our platform to improve discovery, increase engagement and unlock major new monetization opportunities,\" the CEO said.\n\nRoku stock has fallen 22% in 2026.\n\nSpotify stock is down 20% year to date.\n\nSpotify's co-CEO Gustav Söderström said, \"Significant disruption happens when new technologies enable new asymmetric business models. For example, this is what Spotify did to music downloads. This is what Uber did to taxi service. But the question everyone should be asking is does this evolution create new business models or are we mostly just seeing new technologies?\"\n\nThe executive added AI disruption fears for software are \"reasonable,\" but that the consumer space is better insulated since its business model relies on ads and subscriptions.",

    "fullText": "AI isn't just arranging rides or driving cars at Uber — it's also imitating CEO Dara Khosrowshahi.\n\nSome Uber employees have created an AI version of their company's top executive, Khosrowshahi said on an episode of The Diary of a CEO podcast hosted by Steven Bartlett.\n\n\"One of my team members told me that some teams have built a 'Dara AI,'\" Khosrowshahi said. \"They basically make the presentation to the Dara AI as a prep for making a presentation to me.\"\n\nThe AI clone helps employees then make changes to their slides and other aspects of their presentation, he said. \"They have Dara AI to tune their prep,\" Khosrowshahi said.\n\nWhile it's not clear how widespread the use of the CEO bot is within Uber's corporate offices, it's the latest example of employees using AI in new ways to help prepare for high-pressure moments in the workplace.\n\nIt also raises a question about how high up the organizational chart AI will be able to move as its use expands at major companies. Even some CEOs, such as Google's Sundar Pichai, have said that AI could replace them eventually.\n\n\"Are you concerned that they're going to show Dara AI to the board?\" Bartlett asked on the podcast, eliciting laughter from both men.\n\nWhile AI models can process large amounts of data, Khosrowshahi said that they still struggle to process and make choices based on new information — something that executives like him have to do.\n\n\"When the models can learn in real-time, that is the point at which I'm going to think that, yeah, we are all replaceable,\" he said.\n\nUber relies on AI for much of its business, including helping run its mainstay ride-hailing business. It's also expanding new use cases, such as its AI Solutions division, which pays independent contractors to train AI for clients.\n\nFor Uber's rank-and-file workers, AI could lead to more jobs. About 30% of Uber's coders, for example, are \"power users\" of AI, Khosrowshahi said.\n\nIf AI makes Uber's engineers each 25% more efficient, the CEO said he'd want \"to hire more engineers, because I want to go faster.\"\n\nAI could also limit head count, he added.\n\n\"I may not decide to add engineering headcount,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"At that point, instead of adding an engineer, I should add agents and buy some more GPUs from Nvidia.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "This as-told-to-essay is based on a conversation with Shaun Chavis, 58, who is based in Baltimore. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nSince being laid off last June, I've applied for over 100 jobs, and I'm completely boggled by the responses I've received — or rather, the lack of them.\n\nWith nearly 20 years of experience across journalism, communications, and marketing, I really did not expect to be out of work this long. But the reality is that I've only had one interview — I'm not even getting screening calls.\n\nBecause I'm not the kind of person to just \"spray and pray\" dozens of applications out into the world, I only apply when I genuinely feel I can do the job and would enjoy it.\n\nI thought I'd be a valuable asset. I was very proud of what I did in my previous company. But it hasn't been easy to just hop over to another company and pick up a new opportunity.\n\nI've actually been ghosted by companies I thought I was having promising conversations with. It's been so mentally difficult to keep putting applications out there and getting rejected with no feedback. It's hard to know the real reason, but I have some theories.\n\nIt could be ageism. I have heard from peers that my experience could actually be intimidating to younger hiring managers. Or it could be companies feeling like they can't afford me, given my experience.\n\nI've since moved from Atlanta to Baltimore to be closer to family. I've had to rely on them and dip into my life savings to make ends meet.\n\nI've had to cut out Netflix and luxuries like going to the hairdresser. Not having a disposable income to spend on clothes has also been challenging, as I've lost so much weight, I've been gradually rebuilding my wardrobe. And with Baltimore having a colder winter than Atlanta, I've needed new clothing for the climate.\n\nParticipating in the job market right now just feels like I'm hurting my mental health by continuing, as it's just so terrible. There have been so many roles I've been rejected from that I felt like I was a really strong fit, and I just can't keep doing that to myself.\n\nSo at this point, I really want to lean into consulting. It's better to put my energy into something that I can have more control over.\n\nI love Substack, so I've been building a business called BraveEvelyn that helps companies with their content strategy on Substack. So far, my clients are a concierge medicine company, a femtech client, and a healthtech client. I have some other prospects in the healthtech space, so I'm feeling positive.\n\nLong term, I plan to move to Mexico. I'm hoping to get a digital nomad visa. This is partly driven by the current sociopolitical climate here in the US and by the cost of healthcare. But I also feel I can get a comparable apartment for almost half of what I'm paying now and cut my cost of living while continuing to do my Substack work remotely.\n\nI'll be moving on my own, so I've been intentionally looking for like-minded people already there. For example, I've met a couple of people who travel back and forth between Baltimore and Mexico City, and through WhatsApp groups, I've connected with other Black Americans living in Mexico City.\n\nI think it's going to be really huge for me, as it's just been so hard feeling uncertain about your finances. Being able to turn the tables so that you feel like you're giving yourself space to succeed is so important.",

Over the last month, the firm has continually rolled out new tools and highlighted capabilities for its AI chatbot, Claude, planting the seeds of a panic that's scrambled the hottest trade on Wall Street seemingly overnight.\n\nThe chaos, which began in early February, has sent the software sector into a deep bear market and hit adjacent areas as investors fret over how AI could disrupt businesses across a range of industries.\n\nThe iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF, a proxy for the damage AI panic has visited on the software sector in particular, is down 27% from its peak in early January.\n\nHere are the moments that how Anthropic and Claude have upended the stock market in a matter of weeks:\n\nWhat happened: The bloodbath began when Anthropic added new tools to its Claude Cowork AI agent, which could help users in the legal industry with tasks such as tracking compliance and managing legal documents.\n\nThe additions fueled fears that AI could easily eat up the market for many software-as-a-service companies that exist today, hammering firms with exposure to the legal and publishing sectors in particular.\n\nThe iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF plummeted 11% in the four days after Anthropic unveiled its new suite of tools. Here were some of the other notable moves, ordered by losses in the same time frame:\n\nWhat happened: After a few instances of other companies making waves with AI announcements of their own—including a former karaoke machine company—Anthropic returned with another update that induced a new bout of selling.\n\nThe company unveiled a feature for Claude Code last Friday that scans software for security issues. The broader software sector declined, but cybersecurity stocks were hit particularly hard.\n\nMarket reaction: The reaction came at the start of this week, with cybersecurity stocks and ETFs tumbling in Monday's session and some names extending losses on Tuesday.\n\nHere are some of the other notable moves since February 20:\n\nWhat happened: Anthropic published a post highlighting Claude's ability to modernize code, potentially reducing the cost of many COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) systems used by companies today.\n\n\"Modernizing a COBOL system once required armies of consultants spending years mapping workflows,\" the firm wrote in a blog post on Monday. \"AI changes this.\"\n\nMarket reaction: IBM was the big loser. The stock recorded its worst losses in 26 years as the stock fell 13%.

    "description": "RCS is no longer insecure on iOS—if you're a beta tester.",
    "fullText": "Perhaps the best thing to happen to smartphones in the past five years was Apple's decision to start supporting RCS. Ever since, texting between iPhone and Android hasn't been a nightmare caused by SMS: Group chats function as they should, photos and videos can be sent in high quality, and you can even see when the other person is typing—though the messages are still green.\n\nWhile the experience is miles better than it used to be, it isn't perfect. There are still some key functions missing from RCS on iPhone. For instance, you can't unsend messages, reply to a thread, or edit iPhone messages. The latter can only happen on the Android side, while only iPhones can react with emojis right now. The biggest omission, however, is support for end-to-end encryption (E2EE). This is arguably the most important advantage RCS has over SMS. E2EE \"scrambles\" your messages, and only you and the recipient(s) have the \"keys\" to unscramble them. If a hacker were to remotely access your messages from an untrusted device, they wouldn't be able to read them: The only way to see these messages in plain text is to have access to the trusted device associated with them.\n\nIf you have an Android device, and you text with other Android devices using Google Messages, you likely have this advantage. You may see a small lock icon next to your messages as you send them, indicating that texts are sent with E2EE. iPhones have this advantage when texting other iPhones, as iMessage is E2EE as well. But when you text from an iPhone to an Android, whether or not you're using RCS or SMS, those messages are not protected by encryption, which leaves you vulnerable to hacking.\n\nThat's now changing. Apple is currently testing E2EE support for RCS on iPhone. Not only that, anyone can try it out right now—assuming you're fine taking on the risks of beta software.\n\nThe change comes with the second beta for iOS 26.4, which Apple released on Monday. Apple's first beta for 26.4 added an initial layer of support, but only for iPhones texting each other with iMessage disabled. The second beta now supports E2EE for RCS communications with Android devices. As long as your Android friends are running the latest version of Google Messages, and you're running the second iOS 26.4 beta, you can rest easy knowing your messages are protected by end-to-end encryption.\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean that those of us waiting for the official iOS 26.4 release will enjoy the same. While beta features are always subject to change, Apple explicitly says in its release notes that, \"This feature is not shipping in this release and will be available to customers in future iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS 26 releases.\" It seems the company is getting a jump on testing in anticipation of a future iOS 26.4.1, iOS 26.5, or maybe even an iOS 27 release.\n\nYou'll need to install the latest beta on your iPhone to give this encryption a try—but don't do that without thinking it through. Beta software is in testing, which means there may be bugs and other instabilities you aren't used to dealing with in iOS. If something goes wrong, and you need to uninstall the beta, you'll need to reset your iPhone entirely. Unless you have a full backup of iOS 26.3 on your computer, you could lose data. As such, I never recommend installing betas on your primary device. It's your choice, of course: Just understand the risks.\n\nIf you do decide to try the beta, you'll also have access to other new features in iOS 26.4—namely, a new Apple Music experience with an AI playlist generator, fresh design, and the ability to add songs to multiple playlists at once.",

    "title": "What Is a Strength Training 'Deload,' and When Do You Need One?",
    "description": "Sometimes you need to lift a bit less to give your body a break.",
    "fullText": "Even among professional athletes, nobody works out at 100% effort every single week. There are times to rest and recover, often for a week or more, and you and I can apply this principle to our routines, as well. Scaling back your strength training for a short period is called a deload. Here's how to do one, and how to know when you need it.\n\nGenerally speaking, a deload is a short period of time—maybe a week, but this can vary—in which you do less strength training than usual. That said, people use the word in a few different ways.\n\nFor some people, a deload is a complete break from training, like a vacation. You take the whole week off, and that’s all there is to it. For others, a deload is just a little bit lower in intensity than your usual work. You may be doing just as many sets and reps, but the weights aren’t as heavy. Another way to do this type of deload is to reduce volume, so that you do fewer reps and sets, but the weights may be just as heavy as usual.\n\nWhich type of deload to use will depend on the type of work you’ve been doing up to this point, the reason for the deload, and your (or your coach’s) training philosophy.\n\nA deload allows your body more recovery than you get in your usual training. Every workout incurs a bit of fatigue, and if you're training hard for weeks (or months) at a time, you might be so tired that you can no longer perform as well or do as much work. A little bit of fatigue is normal, but in extreme cases, your health may begin to suffer.\n\nYou don't need to wait until everything falls apart to think about taking a deload. There are several ways strength athletes (and recreational lifters like you and me) plan ahead to include deloads in their training. Here are the main ones:\n\nTo prepare for a competition. To do your best, you’ll need to reduce fatigue without getting rusty. Peaking usually involves a reduction in volume (fewer reps and sets) while keeping the weights heavy.\n\nTo introduce new lifts or goals. You’re more likely to get sore if you’re doing something new and intense, so introducing new exercises or new types of training often makes sense during a week of lighter training (in this context, that’s sometimes called a “pivot week.”)\n\nTo recover after a tough training block. Some programs will have a deload week built in; others times, you may choose to take an extra week after a program finishes and before you start the next one.\n\nAs part of a long-term plan to manage fatigue. Even if your training wasn’t particularly tough, you may want to sprinkle in occasional deload weeks just to be sure you’re not getting unnecessarily fatigued.\n\nIn response to perceived stress. Some programs don’t include planned deload weeks, and it’s up to the lifter to decide when they need a break.\n\nThere are two schools of thought on deloads. One is to use them as-needed: you train hard for as long as you can, and then take a deload when you start to feel beat-up. The other is that deloads should be planned, so that you never find yourself in the position of wondering if it's time to take a deload yet.\n\nI wouldn't say there's a single right answer; both styles of training have succeeded for the right people. But I will say that it's hard to know when is the right time to take a deload if you're doing them as-needed. Some people will want to take a deload as soon as they start to struggle even the tiniest bit, even if their problem isn't something a deload can fix. Meanwhile, a lot of dedicated athletes will keep training long after they should have taken a break. It may be smarter to plan ahead and take those deloads whenever the calendar says it's time.\n\nIf you’re working with a coach, ask them about their big-picture plans for you. The deloads (or lack thereof) should be part of the puzzle, and have a reason for being programmed the way they are.\n\nIf you’re running a program that you’ve found on the Internet or in books, take a moment to think about how your program approaches deloads. Some may include deloads, and some may not. If you’re programming for yourself, you can take inspiration from other programs that are out there, but you should also use some common sense and ask yourself how you are feeling.\n\nDeloads are a common tool for fatigue management, but they aren’t the only tool. Your program may adjust volume from week to week, for example, in a way that keeps you feeling fresh. If that’s the case, you may not need a deload at all. Even if you’re preparing for a competition, a deload is a very common way to reduce fatigue and ensure a good performance, but that doesn’t mean you always need to deload before a competition. (It’s common to “train through” a competition that is low priority, for example.)\n\nA deload is really just a training tool, so make sure you’re matching your choices about deloads to what your body needs.",

    "title": "What People Are Getting Wrong This Week: Is Selena Gomez a Clone?",
    "description": "Spoiler alert: No.",
    "fullText": "I've spend more time than I care to admit researching Selena Gomez today. The 33-year-old pop singer and star of Only Murders in The Building is at the center of an elaborate online conspiracy theory that been building steam all week. Why? In brief, many people online seem to believe Selena Gomez is a clone.\n\nIt started with the Epstein files. Last week, videos started showing up on TikTok claiming Selena Gomez was mentioned in the Epstein files. She was, but Gomez wasn't corresponding with Epstein; her name is mentioned in a July 21, 2017 message between Jeffery Epstein and Lana (NAME REDACTED) in which Epstein writes, \"sorry , you would have had fun. he has diecided [sic] on selena gomez.\"\n\nConspiracy theorists have been using the Epstein files as evidence to confirm basically anything since they were released in January, and that Gomez reference from Epstein is, in their minds, a smoking gun that proves she's a clone. The theory says the real Selena Gomez passed away during a kidney transplant operation in 2017, and the person we think is Selena Gomez is a genetically engineered replica. Interestingly, I can't find anyone talking about why someone would go to the trouble, but maybe it was to keep the Gomez-money-machine printing cash.\n\nTo back up the cloning assertion, believers in the theory are comparing pictures and videos of a pre-2017 Gomez with her current appearance and pointing out all the ways she doesn't look and sound like she did almost a decade ago. She has a rounded face now where here face used to be angular! Her voice is different too; she used to sound bubbly and high-pitched, now she sounds like Madeline Kahn. This has led some to believe she somehow is Madelein Kahn. (Or maybe Geena Davis.)\n\nIt's impossible to prove a negative, but I'm still comfortable saying that Selena Gomez is definitely not a clone. Scientists have cloned all kinds of animals, from sheep to primates, so there's theoretically no reason a human couldn't be cloned. But it hasn't been done (that anyone knows about), because it's so unethical. But even if you put ethics aside, animal cloning has an extremely high failure rate: It took 79 embryos and 42 surrogate mothers to clone two macaque monkeys, for instance, and that was using fetal cells. Attempts to make cloned monkeys from adult cells went worse: 181 embryos were implanted into 42 surrogate mothers, and two baby monkeys were born, but both died within hours. The idea that a small army of doctors and scientists and 40+ surrogate mothers are keeping quiet about that one time they were supposed to give birth to Selena Gomez's clone isn't credible.\n\nLike a lot of conspiracy theories, this one doesn't even hold up to its own logic: if Selena Gomez had been cloned, wouldn't the new version be identical to the old one? Why the changes in voice and appearance? If the clone can be spotted on sight (or upon listening to her sing), why make a clone at all?\n\nMore importantly, you can't clone a full-grown person. You can (theoretically) clone a human embryo, but it would have to be implanted in someone's womb, gestate, and be born. You'd have to raise it too. A Selena Gomez clone wouldn't just pop out of a giant test tube and report to the set of a late-career Woody Allen movie.\n\nSpeaking of Woody Allen, the most reasonable explanation for that email is Jeffery Epstein telling \"Lana\" who Woody Allen had cast in A Rainy Day in New York—a movie shot in 2017 that stars Selena Gomez. The timeline fits perfectly with that movie's pre-production schedule—they announced the casting publicly two weeks later—and Epstein and Allen were longtime acquaintances.\n\nSelena Gomez has lupus, a debilitating disease serious enough to have required her to receive a kidney transplant in 2017. No matter how rich and famous you are, you don't come out of that unmarked. The change in the shape of the face (\"Moon face\" as it's called) and body are well known side effects of the corticosteroids/steroids given to treat Lupus, as well as the immunosuppressants given for organ transplants. Same with her voice: Lupus causes vocal changes in about 80% of sufferers. Inflammation of the cricoarytenoid joint commonly leads to a lower pitched or raspy voice. Gomez even addressed the changes herself, noting that her \"throat kinda swells inside sometimes\" due to her health issues.\n\nIn short, Selena Gomez looks and sounds exactly like someone who has lupus and had a kidney transplant in 2017. Ironically, if she looked the same as she did 10 years ago, it would be much stronger evidence for a conspiracy. It would be totally reasonable to ask, \"did she really have a kidney replaced? Does she really have lupus?\" But she clearly did and does, and you can see it on her face and hear it in her voice.\n\nWhen it comes to cloning conspiracies, we've been her before. In 1969, hippies were convinced that Paul McCartney of the Beatles had died, and been replaced by Billy Shears, the (fictional) winner of a Paul McCartney look-a-like contest. In 2003, Avril Lavigne was said to have been replaced by a body double Melissa Vandella. Gucci Mane came out of prison in 2016 looking slimmer, and fans thought he was a clone. Britney Spears is AI. Eminem is an android. It never ends. I'm not sure why people in parasocial relationships with entertainers love pretending they're fake, but they really do.\n\nI don't think many Selena Gomez fans really believe she's a clone, even if they post about it online. At least, they don't believe it in the same way they believe the sun is going to rise tomorrow. I doubt I could get anyone to put money on it. It feels more like it's half fan-fiction, an exciting (if ghoulish) game of what if?\n\nBelieving in a world where a cabal of Hollywood mad scientists secretly cloned an actress so Hulu could produce more Only Murders in the Building is more exciting than accepting the dull, randomness of actual life. It's hard to accept that anyone, even a celebrity, can be stricken with a debilitating diseases that changes their faces and gives them unfamiliar voice, just because that's how shit goes sometimes. Because that means it could happen to you. In conspiracy-land, at least there's someone in charge of the bad things that happen. We'd rather have someone steering the bus, even with terrible intentions, than accept that there is no driver, and the exit doors are sealed shut.",

    "title": "Why Gamers Are Still Mad About Discord's Age Verification",
    "description": "Discord might have been keeping your data for longer than anticipated.",
    "fullText": "It's been a little over a week since Discord said it will take its age verification mandate global, and despite promises that most users wouldn't need to verify, the company is still in hot water with gamers.\n\nMost recently, Discord's been discovered to have worked with Peter Thiel-backed company Persona, which itself is embroiled in multiple scandals. These include allegations that it was keeping personal identifying data from Discord users longer than was initially stated, and a reveal that the company accidentally left some of its data available to view on the open internet. Discord now says it's backing away from its partnership with Persona, but is it worth sticking around after all this?\n\nWhen Discord announced that it would soon require age verification globally, it actually followed age verification programs that had already started in regions like Australia and the UK. Discord's only known age verification partner in the United States is k-ID, which uses on-device facial scanning, but users discovered that in the UK, the company had also partnered with Persona. Discord's partnership with Persona was for an \"experiment\" that could have seen users submitting information that would have been \"temporarily stored for up to seven days, then deleted.\"\n\nAccording to reporting from PCGamer, the information came to light following reports that some UK-based Discord users had gotten requests to submit information to Persona, which prompted concerns about their facial data leaving their devices despite the initial announcement's promise that only government ID data would go to the cloud, as well as how long any uploaded data would stay in the cloud. In a now-deleted support page, Discord clarified that the partnership was indeed real and part of an experiment, and added the note about the potential seven-day window for deletion, which contradicted statements that uploaded data would be deleted directly after age verification.\n\nIn a post on X, the CEO of Persona, Rick Song, attempted to defend the workflow, saying that \"on-device facial scanning\" is \"unfortunately too easy to bypass today,\" before later adding that uploaded information is still \"processed and then deleted.\" However, Song did not provide a timeline for deletion. And data potentially leaving the user's device despite initial promises that it wouldn't was only one part of the concern.\n\nOver the weekend, a trio of hacktivists also discovered a vulnerability in Persona's data front end, which—according to analysis from independent publication The Rage and anti-malware organization Malwarebytes—left 2,456 files accessible to the open internet. Both the hackers and Persona's CEO, who have been in \"good faith\" communication, say that Persona itself was not hacked, and that the data was accidentally leaked and viewable to anyone with the know-how to find it (it has since been deleted).\n\nThe full report of the findings has been published by one of the hackers, Celeste, and details that the leak was apparently found via a U.S. government-authorized endpoint that had somehow been isolated from its regular work environment. While the hackers did not find personal identifying information in the leaked files, they did find that Persona often performs far more than age verification on data sent to its servers. According to the leaked code, the company uses facial recognition to perform 269 separate verification checks against watchlists across 14 categories (including terrorism and espionage) and tags its reports with codenames related to known public-private partnerships for tracking anything from cannabis distribution to money laundering. Information including collected IP addresses, browser and device fingerprints, phone numbers, names, faces, and more, can be stored for up to three years, according to the hackers' findings.\n\nGranted, it's possible that Persona was not implementing all of these checks on users submitting age verification information via Discord, or keeping data for longer than the seven days mentioned on the now deleted support page. But it has not been a good look for either Persona or Discord.\n\nFollowing user outrage about personal data leaving their devices or staying on the cloud for an unknown period of time, as well as the news that the company responsible for said data had apparently allowed so many of its files to leak to the open internet, Discord has begun damage control.\n\nThe company told Ars Technica that only a \"small number of users was included in the experiment\" involving Persona, and that it \"ran for less than one month.\" More importantly, now that the experiment is purportedly over, Discord told both Ars and The Verge that it is no longer partnering with Persona, and that it will \"keep our users informed as vendors are added or updated.\"\n\nOn Persona's end, the company clarified to Ars that it doesn't have any government contracts. CEO Rick Song also said in communication with the hackers that the leaked information was based on publicly available records, before iterating that Persona does not store data that users send to it. Song also said that Persona does not use AI, and despite being funded in part by Peter Thiel, does not have a relationship with Palantir.\n\nWhile it's unclear the extent to which Persona was storing or analyzing user data, that it came as a surprise to so many users has been enough to see a massive increase in users trying alternatives like Teamspeak, which itself has taken the opportunity to criticize Discord's security.\n\nPersonally, I likely won't uninstall Discord right away (if only because I need it to write stories like this), but I would think twice about uploading information if asked to verify my age. Note, however, that Discord can use metrics like your signup email to guess your age even if you don't send it personal identifying information—that's actually how it's planning to avoid pestering most of its users with age verification prompts.\n\nBut even if you divest from Discord, it should be noted that, depending on the services you use in your life, you might still have to interact with Persona. While Discord will no longer work with the age verification company, Persona still has active relationships with social media sites including Reddit and LinkedIn, games like Roblox, and even payment service Square and access management platform Okta.\n\nMost notable might be Persona's relationship with OpenAI: This appears to be how Persona's code could have leaked in the first place. The hacktivists that discovered the leak found OpenAI signifiers in it—which, according to The Rage, means that OpenAI might have built an internal database for accessing Persona identity checks. This could explain how Persona's data found its way onto a U.S. government computer despite the company supposedly not having any government contracts.\n\nAt any rate, as the internet becomes more connected and age verification becomes more common, flipping one switch, like divesting from a single app, likely isn't enough to fully wipe your online presence anymore. It's worth controlling what you can—Discord lets you delete information like sent messages or server channels—but it's legally obligated to retain purchase information, and also chooses to retain additional information such as database backups as well, even after account deletion. You can see a full list of retained Discord information on the company's website.\n\nIn the meantime, check out these 10 tips from my colleague Pranay Parab for staying secure while online.",

    "title": "This App Will Detect People Wearing Smart Glasses Near You",
    "description": "Smart glasses are inconspicuous, but this app can spot them for you.",
    "fullText": "Smart glasses aren't just the stuff of Hollywood anymore: You can buy a pair right now. Devices like Ray-Ban Metas come equipped with speakers, a microphone, embedded cameras, and connectivity to your smartphone—all in a package that largely looks like a normal pair of glasses. That's great for enthusiasts who want a hands-free smartphone experience when out and about, but not so great for anyone who dislikes the idea of invisible cameras everywhere.\n\nThere are two sides to these privacy worries. One is the personal angle. Many of us don't want the people around us shoving their smartphone cameras in our faces when we're out in public, but at least then we'd know we're being recorded. These embedded cameras are tough to spot unless you know what you're looking for, which means there's a feeling of always being watched by anyone walking past wearing glasses. On the other hand, there's the larger privacy concern that comes with the territory of a huge company like Meta. Just last week, we learned the company plans to bring facial recognition tech to its Ray-Ban and Oakley smart glasses with a feature called \"Name Tag,\" which would give the wearer insights into the people they encounter using Meta AI. Taken together, smart glasses pose an unprecedented privacy and security risk for those of us living our lives, when both our neighbors and law enforcement have the accessibility to spy on us without our knowledge.\n\nOf course, what can you do? If these glasses are legal, and they're relatively inconspicuous, how can you protect yourself from the average Ray-Ban Meta-wearing Joe? By the time you get close enough to tell whether or not they're wearing smart glasses, you're already in view of the camera.\n\nEnter \"Nearby Glasses,\" a new app that spills the beans on smart glasses wearers near your location. As reported by 404 Media, the app is made by developer Yves Jeanrenaud, and scans for smart glasses' \"distinctive Bluetooth signatures\" (also known as \"advertising frames\") to identify them in your immediate area. Jeanrenaud was able to use a directory of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) manufacturers to build a list of smart glasses the app can scan for, including devices from Meta, Luxottica Group S.p.A, and Snap. If the app spots one, it sends you a push notification.\n\nThe app can't currently distinguish between smart glasses and mixed reality headsets, however. As such, you may get an alert saying there are smart glasses nearby, but because the app picked up the Bluetooth signals from a Meta Quest headset. That said, these are much easier to spot than smart glasses, and are far less likely to be worn inconspicuously in public spaces.\n\nNearby Glasses is available for Android today, on both the Play Store as well as Github. Jeanrenaud says an iOS port \"is in the making.\"",

He'll be a real asset for us as a group and I can't wait for him to join us this summer to help shape the squad's development as we head into the Nations Championship.\"\n\nMurchie added: \"The opportunity to move into international rugby with Wales, where there are so many exciting competitions on the horizon, was something that me and my family are hugely excited about.\n\n\"Steve was a huge driver for me, I know he is a world class coach and we have worked together closely before.\"\n\nWales have been operating without a designated defence coach, with Tandy combining the duties alongside his head coach role while being helped on a temporary basis by former Wales flanker Dan Lydiate.\n\nTandy has only Matt Sherratt and Danny Wilson as permanent members in his current backroom staff.\n\nHe has bolstered his management team with Rhys Patchell, Duncan Jones and Paul James on secondment.\n\nTandy's work as defence coach for Scotland impressed enough to earn the same role with the British and Irish Lions last summer, so he was expected to tighten things up for Wales when he took the reins last September.\n\nIn his first seven games in charge - albeit including matches against the world's top four teams in their past five Tests - Wales have conceded 328 points and 46 tries.\n\nThomas among Wales players released and Davies out\n\nAgony and hope for Wales after Scotland loss\n\n'Life in Welsh rugby' but stats show issues remain\n\nMurchie, a former full-back, won three Scotland caps and made 116 appearances for Glasgow.\n\nHe was part of the Warriors' league-winning side of 2015 and retired at the age of 31 in January 2018 on medical grounds.\n\nThe 40-year-old initially cut his coaching teeth with French side Stade Nicois as a player-coach.\n\nHe returned to take charge of Ayr, leading them to a league and cup double in 2018-19, before being named head coach of Ayrshire Bulls for the inaugural Super6 campaign.\n\nMurchie joined Glasgow in March 2021 and became the first man to record 100 matches as a coach and player for the club.\n\nUnder Murchie, the club's defence became one of the meanest in the United Rugby Championship (URC).\n\nHe was a key figure as Glasgow conceded the fewest tries of any team in the competition across the course of the title-winning 2023-24 season.\n\nMurchie was also part of the Scotland A coaching side in November 2024 before leaving the Warriors to join Kobe Steelers following the end of the 2024-25 season.\n\nWRU director of rugby and elite performance Dave Reddin said: \"We're delighted to add Pete to the full-time Wales coaching team alongside Steve, Matt and Danny.\n\n\"As someone who knows and understands Steve's defensive philosophy, I know he will quickly add value as we build towards Rugby World Cup 2027.\"\n\nWales' late loss 'gut-wrenching' - Lake\n\nThe key moment for Scotland's win against Wales\n\nSix Nations: The weekend review with Warburton & Barclay",

    "fullText": "Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye caught the eye again when he wore a pair of bright white leggings for Monday's Premier League match against Manchester United.\n\nIt's certainly not the first time a player has stood out because of their kit choice.\n\nSome of those decisions are because of warmth and comfort - and some are for marginal gains.\n\nBut what are some of football's newer fashion choices - and how acceptable do we think they are to fans?\n\nUndershorts and undershirts are a familiar sight, but full-length leggings like those worn by Gueye are much more unusual.\n\nThe leggings, which must match the colour of the shorts on top, are primarily worn for an additional layer of warmth and - in some cases - comfort.\n\nManchester United legend Ryan Giggs once wore black support leggings as he returned from hamstring injury.\n\nIn principle, the idea of outfield players wearing gloves is fine. But there are certain circumstances when it has been questionable.\n\nIn 1999, Nicolas Anelka scored twice for France during a match against England... while wearing a pair of goalkeeper gloves.\n\nFurther back, in the 1980s former Nottingham Forest defender John Metgod wore brown gloves that looked more suited to gardening than the football pitch.\n\nFor purists, the jury is out on whether wearing gloves with short sleeves is acceptable...\n\nOne of football's more recent fashion trends has been players cutting holes in the back of their socks.\n\nPlayers are doing it to relieve pressure on their calf muscles when running in tight socks.\n\nOne of the rarer football fashion choices is that of tracksuit bottoms, which goalkeepers are allowed to wear.\n\nThey are among the game's more retro fashion choices, though former Crystal Palace No 1 Gabor Kiraly famously wore them throughout his career.\n\n\"I'm a goalie, not a model,\" he once said. \"I've played on clay or grass that's been frozen in winter; it makes your legs hurt when you fall so jogging bottoms seemed obvious.\"\n\nFormer Manchester United goalkeeper Massimo Taibi wore tracksuit bottoms during his short stint at Old Trafford, while former Colombia keeper Rene Higuita was wearing them while making his famous scorpion-kick save against England in 1995.\n\nCaps are a more traditional piece of attire for goalkeepers, who tend to wear them to aid visibility when there is a chance the sun will get in their eyes.\n\nIn recent seasons, Crystal Palace's Dean Henderson and Tottenham's Guglielmo Vicario have both sported club-branded caps during matches.\n\nHeadbands and Alice bands are becoming increasingly popular sights in men's football.\n\nEngland internationals Anthony Gordon and Noni Madueke are regular headband-wearers, while Tottenham midfielder Yves Bissouma wore one during Sunday's north London derby against Arsenal.\n\nThey are largely worn by players with longer hair to stop it falling over their eyes.\n\nFootballers are not allowed to wear branded headbands, though, and in 2022 former Newcastle winger Allan Saint-Maximin was fined by the Football Association for wearing one with a designer branding.\n\nPlayers have been banned from wearing snoods during matches since 2011, but prior to that Carlos Tevez, Samir Nasri and Ashley Young were among those who donned them during fixtures.\n\nPlayers and coaches still wear them frequently during pre-match warm-ups and training for an added layer of warmth.\n\nAnother accessory more commonly worn during colder months, skin-tight undershirts give players an added layer of warmth.\n\nPlayers did used to be able to wear a different coloured undershirt to their kit, but that was outlawed to prevent clashes.\n\nWith a number of shirt manufacturers opting not to make long-sleeved shirts that can be worn in Premier League matches, players often wear either short-sleeved shirts over undershirts or replica long-sleeved shirts that are made for commercial sales to supporters.\n\nPlayers commonly wear wrist tape in matches in order to stabilise their joints and limit the risk of sprains or injuries sustained in collisions or tackles.\n\nAt times, players also wear tape around their fingers for similar reasons.\n\nThe International Football Association Board - the body responsible for making the laws of the game - no longer allows players to wear tape over jewellery, which is not permitted to be worn.\n\nShinpads are very much a necessity - and an Ifab requirement for players - but the size of some has become a talking point.\n\nBurnley winger Marcus Edwards was among those pictured sporting particularly small shinpads during their Premier League defeat by West Ham.\n\nJack Grealish has also previously worn smaller shinpads - designed for increased mobility, comfort and ankle flexibility.\n\nAnother recent trend is for players to wear football socks that do not have 'feet' on them - usually known is footless socks.\n\nPlayers commonly cut the bottom of socks off themselves or buy them pre-made.\n\nInstead, players wear separate ankle socks for comfort and more flexibility in football boots compared to wearing a traditional one-piece sock.\n\nSimilarly to socks, some players have been cutting holes at the back of their football boots to make them more comfortable.\n\nSome footballers have Haglund's deformity - a condition in which people get an enlarged bony bump on the back of their heels which can rub against the inside of football boots.\n\nOther players cut their boots to put less pressure on their feet, with former Brazil internationals Neymar and Philippe Coutinho among those to do this.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nWho is one card away from suspension in the Premier League?\n\nVAR vs TMO – what are the key differences?\n\nWhich club has the most red cards in a Premier League season?\n\n'Who's going to get this fine?' - Arteta on derby technology delays",

    "fullText": "When Everton said a tearful farewell to their atmospheric Goodison Park home after 133 years in the summer, hopes were high that Hill Dickinson Stadium could become the fortress fans dreamed of.\n\nAn unbeaten five-match start at their new ground, inspired by new signing Jack Grealish, raised expectations further.\n\nBut defeat against Manchester United on Monday cemented Everton's status as the latest Premier League team to find the transition to a new stadium tough going.\n\nThe Toffees have failed to win any of their past seven matches at their gleaming 52,769-capacity arena, following in the footsteps of other top-flight sides who have struggled after moving grounds.\n\nBBC Sport takes a closer look at the curse of the new stadium in the Premier League era.\n\nEight clubs - only counting teams who were in the top flight for both their last season at their old ground and first at their new, and excluding temporary homes - have moved stadiums since 1992-93, but only one finished the next season with an improved record.\n\nDerby County went from an average of 1.6 points per game in their last year at the Baseball Ground to an impressive 2.1 as they adapted brilliantly to a debut campaign at Pride Park in 1997-98.\n\nMiddlesbrough had an identical record between Ayresome Park and the Riverside, but the other teams all suffered a drop-off.\n\nTottenham were always unlikely to match their stunning White Hart Lane finale of 17 wins and two draws when they moved to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium after a spell at Wembley.\n\nBut seven years on they are still to establish their arena as a place teams fear to come, with some pundits claiming it is too welcoming for opposition players. Only Wolves have lost more home games in Europe's big five leagues this season than Spurs, with eight.\n\nWest Ham had an immediate drop-off in their first season at London Stadium, dropping half a point per game on average. Their plight at the hugely unpopular and vast former athletics track is well documented, with fans pining for Upton Park's intimidating atmosphere.\n\nIt was a similar story for Southampton after they left the tight confines of the Dell for St Mary's.\n\nEverton are only 0.2 points per game down on their final season at Goodison but, given their most recent win at Hill Dickinson came on 6 December, they have some work to do to reverse the trend given they face Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City before the end of the season.\n\nMonday's loss to United was Everton's sixth at home this season in the league, surpassing their total from the whole of their final campaign at Goodison.\n\nThey are sixth in the away form table, having secured six wins and 21 points on the road, but languish in 14th for home results with only four wins from 14 games.\n\nSince their bright start they have shipped four goals at home to both Newcastle and Brentford and three to Spurs, while a statement win over a big club is yet to materialise.\n\nGoals have also been at a premium in front of their own supporters, with only five scored in their past seven matches in all competitions.\n\nManager David Moyes has increasingly found himself fielding questions as to why his side are finding the transition so tough.\n\n\"There is probably a change - other teams come here and enjoy it,\" he said after the United game.\n\n\"You think of Goodison - narrow tunnel; the players can touch you. It feels a bigger space than Goodison.\n\n\"Tonight we lost a goal when we were a bit wide open. There are things about it which are different and we have to get used to.\n\n\"Our games are better than at Goodison but our team is better. It isn't as though we were winning every game at Goodison.\"\n\nBBC Sport's Everton Fan's Voice writer Briony Bragg has noted that the increased pitch size - 100x68m at Goodison compared to 105x68m at Hill Dickinson - has made a difference.\n\n\"The pitch is five metres longer than Goodison Park, and David Moyes has persisted with James Tarkowski and Michael Keane at centre-half this season,\" she said.\n\n\"They don't have the pace Jarrad Branthwaite and Jake O'Brien do, and statistics prove Everton perform better when either is not being shoehorned in at left- or right-back.\"\n\nEverton have five games to turn their Hill Dickinson form around before the end of the season, but there is work to do for it to feel like home.\n\nLatest Everton news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Everton - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "England captain Leah Williamson says she would \"never rule out\" strike action to get players' messaging across to governing bodies about schedule concerns.\n\nWilliamson, 28, missed five months with injury following England's victory at Euro 2025 as she recovered from knee surgery.\n\nShe returned to action at the start of December, helping Arsenal win the Women's Champions Cup in February, and was selected for this month's World Cup qualifiers.\n\nWilliamson is one of several big-name players who are still returning to full fitness following England's success in Switzerland, alongside Chelsea's Lucy Bronze.\n\nSpeaking before England's game against Ukraine on Tuesday, 3 March (17:00 GMT kick-off), Williamson was asked about the potential causes of injury.\n\n\"We'll never know for sure but I don't think people argue against the scheduling for fun. There's reasons behind it,\" said Williamson.\n\n\"If you listen to the players' group, of course we want to play all the time, but the more successful you are - and this team has been very successful - then the less rest you have and the higher risk of injury there is. It's an accumulation.\n\n\"The players, I'm sure, would love to just turn up and play football, but we use our voice and we try to get involved in conversations with the hierarchy so that they at least have our perspective. Whether they listen to it or not, is out of our control.\"\n\nPlayers' union FifPro released a report, external in November saying that last year was the first time since it started collecting data in 2020 that the top 15 players in the world had all played 50 games or more in a season.\n\nEngland midfielder Keira Walsh previously urged governing bodies to \"listen to the players\" about the congested fixture schedule.\n\nAsked whether Williamson would consider more drastic action, such as players striking, she said: \"I've not had any conversations about this right now, but if a group of people don't feel like they're getting listened to, then history suggests that's the only way they can be heard.\n\n\"I would never take it off the table. I don't think that's where we are now. I think we're still in a place where we can collaborate, listen and educate.\"\n\nWilliamson also revealed players have been \"forthcoming\" with providing stakeholders with training load and female health data.\n\n\"It's mainly around the rest periods and trying to get all governing bodies to align. It always sounds like we're asking for a holiday, but that's not the case,\" she added.\n\n\"I'm a professional footballer and part of my job is also to rest, which I'm encouraged to do so by my managers and the environments we play in.\n\n\"So why is that not prioritised when we're left to our own devices?\"",

    "fullText": "T20 World Cup, Super 8 Group 2, Pallekele\n\nPakistan 164-9 (20 overs): Farhan 63 (45); Dawson 3-24\n\nEngland 166-8 (19.1 overs): Brook 100 (51); Shaheen 4-30\n\nHarry Brook's sensational century under pressure led England into the T20 World Cup semi-finals with a two-wicket victory over Pakistan in Pallekele.\n\nThe England captain promoted himself to number three after Phil Salt was dismissed first ball and made exactly 100 in a chase of 165.\n\nIt was the first time Brook had batted first drop in his T20 international career but he played the situation perfectly, going up and down the gears as wickets fell around him.\n\nJos Buttler failed again - out for three in the third over - while Jacob Bethell fell for eight and Tom Banton two as England slipped to 58-4.\n\nBut Brook hit 10 fours and four sixes - once again delivering on his undeniable talents.\n\nHe was bowled by Shaheen Afridi a ball after reaching his hundred - the first of his T20 international career - in 50 balls but by then only 10 runs were needed from the last three overs.\n\nBrook's team-mates still threatened to throw all of his good work away as the wickets of Will Jacks and Jamie Overton followed, leaving it to Jofra Archer to swing away the winning runs with five balls to spare.\n\nIt means Brook's side return to India for a semi-final on either Wednesday or Thursday next week, with their opponents and the venue still to be confirmed by the remainder of the Super 8 stage.\n\nThey are there without ever really convincing - here they were sloppy in the field when restricting Pakistan to 164-9 - but are the first team to secure their spot in the last four.\n\nPakistan must hope other results go their way and win the final Group 2 game against Sri Lanka at this venue on Saturday.\n\nBrook century blasts England into semi-finals\n\n'Clocked' by a bouncer in Wellington, as culpable as anyone in the dismal Ashes defeat in Australia, pictured drinking in Noosa and found to have lied when apologising in Sydney.\n\nBrook has had quite the winter.\n\nThis, though, was everything good about England's white-ball captain. He batted at his destructive best.\n\nSurprise greeted the sight of Brook walking down the steps rather than Bethell after Salt nicked off to Shaheen but the thinking was smart.\n\nIt kept the right-hander away from Pakistan's five spinners on a turning pitch at the start of his innings and allowed him to take advantage of the powerplay fielding restrictions.\n\nBrook faced three dots in his first five balls but then took left-armer Salman Mirza for a four and six in the second over.\n\nHe muscled a brutal straight six over long-on off while hitting spinner Mohammad Nawaz for 17 in the sixth, before nudging singles after Banton nicked off to Usman Tariq. The mystery spinner was Pakistan's major threat.\n\nAt halfway, Brook kicked on again, crashing leg-spinner Shadab Khan for a perfect straight six. He scored all around the ground but those straight hits and his drives through the covers were particularly eye-catching.\n\nHe reached three figures with two more hits over mid-off - one for six and another a one-bounce four.\n\nIt made him the third man to score centuries in all three formats for England, after Jos Buttler and Dawid Malan, but more importantly it keeps them on course for a third T20 title.\n\nThe win means England qualify before their final Super 8 game against New Zealand on Friday. They can use that match to try and fine tune.\n\nButtler's form remains a major worry. One of England's all-time greats, who has scored 15 runs in his last five innings and got a bottom edge on a cut here, is struggling.\n\nBefore that, England's fielding, which had remained strong through the tight wins against Nepal, Scotland and Italy in the group stage and Sri Lanka on Sunday, faltered.\n\nBethell let two regulation stops through his hands on the boundary and Brook dropped Shadab on four before he made an important 23. There was also the careless moment of a no-ball for one too many fielders outside the 30-yard circle.\n\nSahibzada Farhan was Pakistan's highest scorer with 65 but he and Babar Azam batted too slowly in a partnership of 46 in 44 balls.\n\nLiam Dawson and Jamie Overton did well to restrict Pakistan in the second half of the innings. Left-arm spinner Dawson took three wickets and a fine high catch while Overton bowled Babar and had Farhan lbw, also taking an excellent diving catch of his own.\n\nThey ensured Pakistan did not kick on from their platform and, along with Brook, were the other major plusses for England.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Tottenham's heavy north London derby defeat against Arsenal on Sunday just confirmed what everyone already knew.\n\nIgor Tudor's team are in serious trouble.\n\nPerilously perched just four points above the Premier League relegation zone following the 4-1 home loss, Spurs have a multitude of issues to resolve.\n\nThey have not won a domestic league game in 2026 and only two since 26 October 2025, meaning that - aside from bottom club Wolves - 16th-placed Tottenham have the worst form in the division.\n\nNew interim head coach Tudor has a crippling injury list to contend with, plus a forthcoming Champions League last-16 tie to negotiate.\n\nAnd all this is while he is attempting to implement new ideas and avoid the unthinkable scenario of dropping down into the Championship.\n\nSince 1950, Spurs have only spent one season outside the top flight, which was back in 1977-78.\n\nBBC Sport assesses their precarious situation, what relegation might bring and if they are too good to go down?\n\nIn Tottenham's remaining 11 Premier League games they will visit Wolves and have home fixtures against sides around them in the table - Crystal Palace, Brighton, Nottingham Forest and Leeds.\n\nHowever, their record at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this season is frankly abysmal, so can they expect to turn their form around against fellow strugglers?\n\nWith just two wins and only 10 points accrued from a possible 42, only Wolves have collected fewer points on home soil.\n\nWhile sports analytics and data experts Opta place their chances of relegation at just 4.84%, worryingly for Spurs supporters their team have collected just 0.67 points per game since defeating Everton on 26 October.\n\nAnd unless Tottenham can arrest their slump, that would equate to a further seven points, taking them to 36 on the final day of the season.\n\n\"I would be really surprised if they weren't able to fight their way out of it,\" former Spurs midfielder Danny Murphy told BBC Sport.\n\n\"The games coming up are all huge. I think they will have just enough.\n\n\"The fact we are mentioning Spurs going down is unbelievable. It's absolutely ridiculous really.\n\n\"Whether you blame recruitment or the owners, it would be catastrophic for that club. I have heard some fans suggest going down could be the best thing. I just don't see that.\"\n\nTottenham finished 17th last term, but were never really in danger of relegation as then-boss Ange Postecoglou juggled an injury-hit squad with a focus on Europe.\n\nWhile their league form suffered they still scored 64 times and the silver lining was a Europa League triumph over Manchester United last May, which also secured a coveted place in the Champions League.\n\nHowever, their attacking output this season has been underwhelming and they would need to average 2.45 goals per game in their forthcoming fixtures to match the same tally as the previous campaign.\n\nThe long-term absences of Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison have hardly helped matters and a stretched squad was without a total of 11 players last weekend, considerably more than any other Premier League club.\n\nFormer full-back Stephen Kelly believes the \"only reason\" Tottenham may stay up is that other teams are even worse.\n\n\"You look at the fixtures coming and you feel like they are ones they could absolutely lose,\" he said.\n\n\"They need a mentality to be able to perform at home. If you can get back to winning some games that can make a huge difference, but it just doesn't feel like that is going to change between now and the end of the season.\n\n\"I don't really want to admit it, and still feel there are teams that are really poor and won't get themselves out of it [relegation], but the only reason Spurs will be OK is that other teams will do worse.\n\n\"It is not a great thing to be talking about, but is probably going to be the case. It is not looking very good at all.\"\n\nThere has been a number of media reports, external outlining the calamitous cost that relegation would bring to Spurs.\n\nAnd the club would undoubtedly face a significant financial hit if it was to start 2026-27 in the second tier.\n\nBroadcast, matchday and commercial incomes would all be squeezed, while the most recent wage bill sat at around £254m as opposed to the Championship average of £38m.\n\nThere would also be a knock-on effect on transfers, not only in the quality of players the club could attract but also in paying off £337m in outstanding instalments for current players.\n\nBBC Sport's own analysis points to an estimated fall in annual revenue of around £261m as football finance expert Kieran Maguire said: \"In 2023-24, the most Spurs generated an average of £84 per supporter per match, the highest figure in the Premier League.\n\n\"That figure would face significant downward pressure, not from the size of the crowd, but from what clubs can realistically charge.\n\n\"Corporate clients who pay a premium for a home fixture against Liverpool or Arsenal are unlikely to pay the same for a visit from Swansea.\n\n\"There is also great financial vulnerability around sponsorship. The front-of-shirt deal with AIA, worth around £40m a year almost certainly contains relegation clauses that could halve its value.\n\n\"The kit deal with Nike, estimated at £30m annually, is likely to take a smaller hit.\n\n\"Spurs supporters will still buy replica shirts regardless of division, but a reduction is likely. Broader sponsorship and partner agreements across the club would face similar issues.\"\n\nHe added: \"For a club of Spurs' ambitions and financial scale, relegation would not simply be a short-term sporting setback. The economics of English football make recovery a multi-year project.\"\n\nThe phrase 'too good to go down' was widely banded around about the Forest side that won the first ever televised live Premier League game against Liverpool in August 1992.\n\nThe sales of England pair Des Walker and Teddy Sheringham had significantly weakened a group more accustomed to challenging at the top end of the table and in domestic cup finals.\n\nAnd the two-time former European champions, with a squad containing Stuart Pearce, Roy Keane, Steve Stone and Nigel Clough went down in legendary boss Brian Clough's final season in charge.\n\nThere have also been other high-profile clubs that have gone the same way.\n\nFabricio Coloccini, Obafemi Martins, Michael Owen, Damien Duff and Nicky Butt were part of the Newcastle squad relegated in 2008-09.\n\nOn paper the Magpies also looked relatively strong in the 2015-16 campaign, with Aleksandar Mitrovic, Georginio Wijnaldum and Andros Townsend in their ranks.\n\nAgain, that wasn't enough and they joined another former European Cup-winning club, Aston Villa in going down that year.\n\nThe basic premise appears to be that the scrap for survival takes no account of big names - once you're down there anything can transpire.\n\n\"If you keep losing games and confidence drops, it doesn't matter how many good players you have, it gets hard,\" added Murphy.\n\nSheffield Wednesday have never returned since losing their top-flight spot in 2000, with their sorry plight well documented.\n\nLike the Owls, Leeds United have dropped down as far as the third tier since being crowned English champions in 1992, while former Premier League winners Blackburn are currently fighting to preserve their Championship status.\n\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Tottenham - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Up to fourth in the Premier League after Monday's win at Everton, Champions League qualification would be a big boost to Manchester United's finances after two years outside Europe's elite club competition.",
    "fullText": "As Manchester United's powerbrokers assessed the wreckage from a catastrophic 2024-25 campaign and tried to plot a way forward for the Old Trafford club, they had some targets to aim for.\n\nYear one - secure an immediate return to Europe, probably in the Europa League, via a sixth-placed Premier League finish.\n\nYear two - back in the Champions League, with fourth seen as a realistic finishing spot for the 2026-27 campaign.\n\nThe determination was clear, the rationale obvious.\n\nThanks to two rounds of redundancies, cost-cutting in most departments and more scrutiny on the spending that does take place, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his management team have succeeded in substantially reducing the club's losses, from the eye-watering £113.2m to a £13m profit in its first quarter accounts to 30 September, 2025.\n\nFinishing sixth in the Premier League this season compared to 15th last term would just about cover the revenue hit for missing out on Europe for only the second time since the ban on English clubs participating was lifted by Uefa in 1990.\n\nBut the cash injection that comes through Champions League qualification is there for all to see.\n\nOn Wednesday, United will release their second quarter financial results to 31 December 2025. In their first quarter results, overall revenue for the 2025-26 financial year was predicted to be between £640m and £660m.\n\nHad a Europa League campaign been included in that, there would be an anticipated increase of between £10m and £35m, depending on performance. For the Champions League, the figures would be £50m as a minimum and potentially more than £100m.\n\nIt is why United believe if they follow the desired path, their overall revenues could be more than £800m by 2028.\n\nThat is why Monday's 1-0 win at Everton, which sent them up to fourth place in the current standings, could be so crucial in determining the club's future.\n\nSesko and Lammens allow Man Utd to dream of Champions League\n\nSesko comes off bench to score Man Utd winner at Everton\n\nUnder their new shirt sponsorship agreement with Adidas, United lose £10m for each season they do not compete in the Champions League. They have never gone three years without competing in it since the tournament was launched in 1992.\n\nOn 4 October, before a 2-0 home win against Sunderland, the club's chances of a top-five finish were the lowest this season. Stats experts Opta rated their chances of a top-four finish at 3.1% - and 5.8% to make the top five.\n\nWhen Ruben Amorim was sacked on 5 January after the 1-1 draw at Leeds – either the third match in a current 10-game unbeaten run in the league or the middle result in a sequence of three successive draws against relegation candidates depending on how you view these things - the numbers had risen slightly to 5.9% and 15.7% respectively.\n\nFast forward to the aftermath of their first outing at Hill Dickinson Stadium, and after five wins out of six under interim boss Michael Carrick, it now stands at 44.2% and 72.0%.\n\nWith English clubs so far ahead in the battle to get one of the extra two Champions League slots - after last week's play-off first-leg ties Portuguese clubs were effectively 13 wins behind, Germany 16, Italy 19 and Spain 22 – it is virtually certain already fifth will be enough.\n\nCarrick will not see it like this of course with 11 games left to play.\n\nBut from their current position, three points behind third-placed Aston Villa with a slightly better goal difference, and three ahead of both Chelsea - who visit leaders Arsenal on Sunday - and Liverpool, plus no European distractions, Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher got it right in his assessment of the situation.\n\n\"Manchester United are now virtually guaranteed for one of the Champions League places,\" said the former Liverpool and England defender. \"I can't see them not making it.\"\n\nThe spin-offs would be enormous.\n\nCarrick has also made a compelling case for getting the manager's job on a full-time basis, especially as a couple of the more experienced, successful and Premier League-ready alternatives Thomas Tuchel and Carlo Ancelotti have committed themselves to their international jobs at England and Brazil beyond the summer.\n\nRoberto de Zerbi has been sacked by Marseille, while Oliver Glasner might well suffer the same fate at Crystal Palace before he leaves when his contract expires in the summer. Their credentials wouldn't look quite so attractive against Carrick's if he did get United back into Europe's elite club competition.\n\nThey would also be a more attractive proposition commercially.\n\nAt a time when questions are starting to be asked about the club's ability to do deals and the lack of a training ground or kit sponsor, that is quite important.\n\nIn addition, although it is some way in the future, if United's new stadium plans eventually proceed, funding will be based around a significant percentage of expensive 'premium' seats.\n\nWhile club officials have stressed no decisions around ticket prices have been taken, a document sent to season ticket holders in October placed indicative prices at £4,830 for season tickets on the lower tier of the stand opposite the dugouts, with hospitality prices rising to £424,800 for a 16-seat large private box in the middle tier of the main stand, level with the halfway line.\n\nClearly, supporters are more likely to be willing to pay such figures if they were watching a team competing for major trophies, something that has not happened since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.\n\nThe club's huge debt, way in excess of £1bn including outstanding transfer fee payments, might at least not need to be increased too.\n\nOver the past six weeks, Carrick has repeatedly stressed he is not getting carried away by his side's impressive form. After the Everton win, a question was put to him about the triumph providing belief around Champions League qualification on a weekend when Villa and Chelsea both drew at home and Liverpool needed an injury-time winner at Nottingham Forest.\n\nCarrick's answer bore no relation to the core point he was being asked. There is logic behind this. Results can change narratives very quickly in football.\n\nWhen he took over at Middlesbrough in 2022, Carrick won 15 of his first 20 league games, then only three of the next 12. A potential automatic promotion place turned into a play-off meeting with Coventry, which Middlesbrough lost. They never got as close to promotion again under the former England midfielder.\n\nHe knows his team are well-placed to seal their Champions League return. Completing the job is the task now.\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Benfica winger Gianluca Prestianni trained alongside his team-mates at Real Madrid's stadium on Wednesday, despite being provisionally banned for Wednesday's Champions League match between the sides.",
    "fullText": "Gianluca Prestianni trained alongside his Benfica team-mates at Real Madrid's Bernabeu stadium despite facing a suspension relating to a racism allegation.\n\nThe winger is provisionally banned from Wednesday's Champions League play-off second leg against Real in the Spanish capital.\n\nVinicius Jr alleged that he was racially abused by the Argentine shortly after scoring a stunning goal that earned Real a 1-0 win in the first leg.\n\nPrestianni, who denies racially abusing Vinicius, is set to miss Wednesday's return leg in Madrid after being given a one-game provisional ban by Uefa.\n\nBenfica are appealing against the sanction, despite the belief that it is unlikely to have any \"practical effect\" before Wednesday's match.\n\nBut Prestianni was pictured training with his team-mates on Tuesday in the hope that his ban could be overturned in time to feature.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois said Vinicius Jr's celebration in last week's Champions League tie in Portugal did not \"justify a suspected act of racism\".\n\nVinicius was shown a yellow card for celebrating in front of the Benfica supporters after his goal in Lisbon.\n\nSpeaking after the game, Benfica boss Jose Mourinho said he believed the Brazilian forward had acted disrespectfully and incited the crowd.\n\n\"Unfortunately [he was] not just happy to score that astonishing goal. When you score a goal like that, you celebrate in a respectful way,\" added Mourinho.\n\nAsked about the comments from his former Chelsea manager, Courtois said: \"Mourinho is Mourinho and, as a coach, you'll always defend your club.\n\n\"But it bothers me that Vinicius' celebration is being used against him.\n\n\"Vini didn't do anything bad. He celebrated the same way many rivals have celebrated against us.\n\n\"It happened, and we can't justify a suspected act of racism because of a celebration. I think we have to be less stupid as a society.\"\n\nMourinho, who is suspended for the second leg at the Bernabeu following his dismissal later in the match, said he was told different things by Vinicius and Prestianni regarding the incident.\n\n'It was down to the victim' - is Uefa's racism protocol working?\n\nVinicius: Eight years at Real Madrid, 20 cases of alleged racist abuse\n\nBenfica's Prestianni gets provisional one-match ban\n\nCourtois refused to be drawn on comments from Benfica president Rui Costa, who said Prestianni \"is not racist\" and deserves the club's trust after \"being crucified\", but reiterated his support for his own team-mate.\n\n\"Vini has never said anything like that, so I'm 100% sure he heard it,\" said the Belgian.\n\n\"I believe him completely. Since he's keeping quiet, we'll never know for sure, but there's not much more we can do.\"\n\nThe tie was halted for 10 minutes after Vinicius alerted referee Francois Letexier to the incident, before his team-mates temporarily left the pitch.\n\nCourtois said Real were prepared to \"stand their ground\", but agreed to complete the game after Vinicius said he wanted to continue.\n\nThere were also reports of racist gestures in the stands at Estadio da Luz.\n\n\"The other things that happened in the stands, in my opinion, warrant stopping the match and kicking those people out,\" added Courtois.\n\n\"As footballers, we don't see everything, but it happens when we're focused on the game. There have to be people in charge who see that.\n\n\"There's a Benfica security guard who's two metres away and he has to act. We can keep improving in these areas... and stop being so foolish.\"\n\nUefa has subsequently sanctioned Prestianni, 20, on a provisional basis, pending the result of a full investigation by an ethics and disciplinary inspector.\n\nThe European governing body said further punishment could be handed out once that investigation is completed.\n\nReal manager Alvaro Arbeloa urged Uefa to use this incident as a chance to make a statement.\n\n\"We have a great opportunity to mark a turning point in the fight against racism,\" he said.\n\n\"Uefa, which has always been and has led this fight against racism, now has the chance not to leave it at just a slogan, at just a nice banner before matches, and I hope that they seize this opportunity.\"\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

    "fullText": "The mayor announced that the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection will investigate employers where more than half their workers take no paid time off in a given year.\n\nIn the industrial neighborhood of Maspeth, Queens, Amazon drivers from the nearby DBK4 delivery station often stop at Angelo’s Deli. It’s where drivers gathered in December 2024 before marching to the facility for the first time as union organizers. On Friday, Mayor Zohran Mamdani chose the deli to sit with a dozen drivers who have unionized with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) and announce that New York City will expand protected time off and crack down on employers where workers rarely use sick leave.\n\n“We are going to be looking at every way that an employer is looking to evade accountability,” Mamdani told me. “It’s time to have a rule of law that applies to everyone, and that includes these kinds of corporations that seem to think of themselves as above it.”\n\nMamdani announced that the city’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) will monitor how often workers at each company use their paid leave. If fewer than half of a company’s employees take any time off in a year, the agency will investigate the employer for potential violations.\n\nJerome Sloss, 32, a driver with an Amazon subcontractor, said Mamdani is following through on his campaign promises. He told me, “His entire campaign has been about taxing the rich and helping working class people, and he’s doing what he said he was going to do.”\n\nThe DCWP based the threshold on its analysis of national data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which found that half of private-sector workers with paid sick leave take at least one day off annually for health reasons. The agency said it will also investigate violations based on complaints from workers.\n\nSince 2014, employees in New York City have been entitled to time off for illness, injury, or other urgent personal business.\n\nThe newly expanded Protected Time Off Law, which will come into effect on Sunday, grants private-sector workers a minimum of 32 hours of unpaid time off per year—available immediately upon hire and at the start of each calendar year. This is in addition to 40 to 56 hours of paid time off annually depending on company size. Approximately 3 million New Yorkers are covered under the law.\n\nThe law also expands when employees can use protected time off to include childcare, caring for a family member with a disability, attending benefits or housing hearings, responding to declared emergencies, and addressing workplace violence.\n\nMamdani has previously backed Amazon workers organizing with the Teamsters. On Friday, he sat with a dozen drivers who shared stories about needing time off for medical emergencies and childcare crises. Mamdani said expanding protected time off is central to improving workers’ quality of life: “This kind of legislation is critical to ensuring that a worker can do more than just work—that a worker can also live, that a worker can also take care of their family and themselves.”\n\nJerome Sloss, 32, a driver with an Amazon subcontractor at the DBK1 facility in Woodside, said workers earn paid leave gradually based on hours worked—roughly an hour of leave for every week on the job: “We don’t get it front loaded at the beginning of the year. You accrue it over the time you work.”\n\nMatt Multari, 25, another driver working at the DBK1 facility, said subcontractors can change their schedules up to 8 pm the night before a shift. Multari asked, “How are you supposed to plan your life around it?”\n\nOther workers said that when they request emergency leave without enough advance notice or when managers question whether the emergency is justified, some subcontractors retaliate by canceling scheduled shifts for the rest of the week. These workers are among more than 200 drivers at DBK1 who have unionized with the Teamsters. Nationwide, the union represents between 7,000 and 10,000 Amazon workers.\n\nMamdani, who campaigned on reducing income inequality, said strengthening unions is key to that goal. “The more organized a workforce, the better the lives those workers will be able to live.”\n\n“To be here with Teamsters members who have been on the front lines of fighting for these very kinds of rights and so much",

    "fullText": "A new report from the United Nations shows staggering levels of food waste around the world, especially in India, which is part of a vicious cycle.\n\nAccording to the new report, extreme heatwaves and severe flooding have worsened the food crisis in India.\n\nAccording to one study, 30-40% of all food produced in India is wasted, as noted by Impakter. The publication also reported that the average Indian household discards approximately 121 pounds (55 kilograms) of food each year.\n\nThe nation wastes roughly 87.5 million tons of food, valued at over $10.15 billion (920.7 billion Indian rupees). According to the Shaksham Foundation, over 224 million Indians are undernourished, and one in every three children under five is stunted due to malnutrition.\n\nThe rate of food waste in India is particularly troubling, given how many households suffer from food insecurity. A lack of food isn't the problem; poor infrastructure, agricultural practices, and consumer mindsets are.\n\nThis food waste is part of a brutal cycle. The immense waste drives up grocery costs, making it more difficult for vulnerable communities to access adequate nutrition.\n\nA different UN report found that India is the world's third-largest methane emitter, according to DownToEarth. Methane is a gas that worsens air pollution and is produced by waste.\n\nThe excessive methane pollution from India are driven by a combination of burning crop residue to make room for new crops and loading up landfills with food waste.\n\nMuch of the waste stems from climate-driven weather, such as heatwaves and floods. But food waste created by extreme weather events then emits methane, which worsens pollution and leads to more weather disasters.\n\nThe cycle is leaving millions of Indians hungry or undernourished, and creating a feedback loop of dangerous weather conditions and severe air pollution. Without intervention, the problem will only grow more dire. People and the planet are suffering, and good food is going to waste.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nThe report included strategies for managing food waste. These included protecting vulnerable populations from rising food costs, aligning policies to stabilize markets, investing in data collection and analysis, and prioritizing industry-wide measures with lasting impact.\n\nInvesting in resilient agrifood systems and new technologies is also recommended. Luckily, scientists are developing exciting new approaches to farming that aim to tackle severe food waste.\n\nInnovative tactics, such as soilless farming, crop evaluation using artificial intelligence, and flood-resistant materials, can improve crop yields in the face of a changing climate.\n\nFood waste must be tackled on multiple levels. From policy implementation and farm production to grocery infrastructure and household habits, solving this food waste problem requires everyone's participation and care.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

Four cats owned by the Hernandez family also vanished, including one that was pregnant.\n\n\"She was going to have babies soon,\" Hernandez said to the outlet, noting her mother-in-law was especially upset by the loss.\n\nBelieving a coyote was responsible, Hernandez had her father-in-law construct a humane cage trap and placed it on the rural property. On the night of Feb. 19, Hernandez's husband went to check the trap and found a mountain lion lying calmly inside.\n\n\"So he woke everybody up, and we got up, and we were all surprised how big it was and how it looked,\" Hernandez said. Her first thought, she added, was for her three children, ages five to nine.\n\nAfter the initial shock, the family called 911. State wildlife officials arrived Friday morning and released the cougar from the trap. It ran off into the surrounding area. The decision surprised the family, who had hoped the animal would be relocated farther away.\n\n\"We weren't really happy about that because of our children and animals,\" Hernandez said to the outlet. The family's neighbor, Jeanette Villegas, who owns horses, echoed those concerns. \"Releasing that animal knowing it has a food source, I believe it may come back,\" she told KTLA5.\n\nWildlife officials explained that under California law, any mountain lion captured in a private trap must be released in the same general area where it was captured.",

    "description": "Top 10: The aircraft made great by a new engine",
    "fullText": "A great aircraft is the civil (or military) partnership of a good engine and good airframe.\n\nAnd sometimes a separation is necessary to make way for a more appropriate partner. Many great aircraft have been held back by a combination with inappropriate or inferior engines. Here are 10 power-hungry flying machines that finally got the engine they deserved:\n\nThe Soviet Tupolev Tu-22 bomber is the David Bowie of aircraft, reinventing itself with such radical vision that you’re left to ponder what exactly is left of the original. Little wonder the supersonic bomber required reinvention really when you consider how awful the original Tu-22 was.\n\nThe original Tu-22 was abysmal in almost every sense. Appalling unserviceability, a wing that allowed aileron reversal at high deflections – a tendency to pitch up and strike its rear end on landing, disappointing range and poor pilot view were only some of the problems. Bizarrely, it still proved popular with many, perhaps overly loyal, aircrew.\n\nThe Backfire served with the Soviet air force and navy, and the design bureau, Tupolev, was under pressure and didn’t take long to plan a major upgrade to this stinker, starting work the very same year the type entered service, 1962. Ten years later a virtually unrecognisable aeroplane, with different (and variable geometry) wings and a host of other modifications, entered service.\n\nDespite all the radical changes, it didn’t get a new model number, just the addition of an M. But it was still a turkey. The terrible Dobrynin RD-7 turbojet had been replaced with the newer, but also terrible, NK-22. The most important change didn’t happen until the Tu-22M3 update, which introduced the Kuznetsov NK-25 turbofan. With this and other refinements, the top speed leapt from Mach 1.65 to 2.05 and its range was increased by a third.\n\nBlackburn Aircraft Limited is famous for making some planes not as good as they should have been, and the initial Blackburn Buccaneer was no exception. The aircraft was a British carrier-based attack aircraft that first flew in 1958. It was a structurally strong design with the innovative use ‘blown flap’ harvesting and steering diverted engine thrust to improve its take-off and landing characteristics.\n\nBut the innovative Buccaneer S.Mk 1 was powered by the unreliable de Havilland Gyron Junior turbojet, and was a weakling. It was underpowered, as test pilot Dave Eagles once joked in our interview with him: “it relied on the curvature of the earth to get airborne.”\n\nThis was solved when the S.Mk 2 was introduced in 1962, powered by the Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan. Replacing the Gyron Junior of 7,100 pounds-force each with the 11,000 lbf Spey was a masterstroke. The Gyron Junior would later be held responsible for a terrible accident in 1970.\n\nThe result was a superb low-level aircraft with a long-range (longer even than the Panavia Tornado), a virtually indestructible construction and a rock-steady low-level ride. The type spent much of its life as a ground-based attack aircraft, and proved its worth in Operation Desert Storm, in 1991. It remained to the end of its life - in 1994 - a potent weapon.\n\nThe DC-3 was an airliner developed in the mid-1930s. At the beginning of the second world war, it was adapted (with minor modifications) into a military transport aircraft and (predominately) designated the C-47. Over 95% of the airframes built were these military versions.\n\nDuring the decade of C-47 production, several engine variants were used, without significant changes to the type or size of the engine. The original DC-3 was powered by the 9-cylinder Wright R-1820 Cyclone 9 producing 1000 horsepower. The C-47 mainly used the 14-cylinder Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp which produced 1200 horsepower.\n\nRoughly one-third of the US-built aircraft was the C-47B variant. This aircraft used Pratt & Whitney R-1830-90 engines with a high-altitude two-speed supercharger. This 1942 modification was critical for the China-Burma-India supply routes and allowed the aircraft to carry a full payload over the 15,000-foot mountain passes.\n\nThe Super DC-3 was developed post-war using 9-cylinder Wright R-1820 Cyclones producing 1475 horsepower. While not commercially viable due to the extensive airframe modifications required, the US Navy converted 100 aircraft, and they were designated R4D-8 and later the C-117D. This variant had a cruise speed of 250 mph, up from 224 mph for the original C-47.\n\nThe British Westland Lynx burst onto the scene in the ‘70s boasting previously unseen levels of manoeuvrability for a helicopter, thanks to a semi-rigid rotor head hewn from a solid block of titanium and two Rolls-Royce Gem gas turbines. The 2000-odd horsepower from two tweaked Gem 60s helped drive one Lynx (registration G-LYNX) to a helicopter World Speed Record of 216 knots (400 km/h, M0.32) in 1986, a record which it still holds today.\n\nUnfortunately, as aircraft age they tend to put on weight – the odd defensive aids suite here, an infra-red camera there – and suddenly you’re underpowered. A process made worse you find yourself committing the classic blunder of getting involved in a land war in parts of the world, where the air is hotter and thinner; both factors count against engine and rotor blade performance.\n\nThere are two ways out of this inevitable decline: set higher limits for the engines and gearbox to run at, and accept the parts won’t last as long. Or you could try finding a new engine. Handily for Westland, the Light Helicopter Turbine Engine Company (LHTEC) had just want they needed left over from the RAH-66 Comanche programme, a US stealth helicopter that was cancelled in 2004.\n\nThe CTS800 engine (developed by a Rolls-Royce/Honeywell joint venture), despite weighing the same as the Gem, produces 35% more power with a max output of 1563 hp, which was only 300 hp less than the maximum continuous power you could get from two Gems. This massively improved the hot and high performance of the Lynx Mk9A introducing novel concepts such as taking a full fuel load and maintaining level flight after an engine failure in Afghanistan or Iraq.\n\nThe Sikorsky S-58 was powered by a Wright Cyclone piston engine. This rather dated engine had been earlier used on several second world war warplanes. In the mid-1960s, Westland hit on the idea of licence-building the American S-58, with one crucial difference. Out went 1200 hp of high-octane, war-winning reciprocation and in came the Napier Gazelle. This was a move of some genius.\n\nAlthough the Gazelle was down on horsepower compared to the Cyclone, 1450 hp to 1525 hp, it was a good deal lighter. This gave it a power-to-weight ratio of 1.31 hp/lb to the Cyclone’s 1.03 hp/lb. Unlike the Cyclone the Gazelle didn’t need a heavy clutch and fan to keep air flowing over its cooling fins, nor did it vibrate like a tumble dryer full of bricks.\n\nThe next step was going from one to two engines. Two Rolls-Royce Gnome engines were substituted for the Gazelle. These provided 1350 hp each giving the Wessex Mk 2 and 5 almost the same performance with One Engine Inoperative (OEI) as the Mk 1 achieved with everything working.\n\nThis extra power didn’t significantly alter the basic performance of the Wessex, as the main rotor gearbox wasn’t designed to take much more than 1550hp continuously. However, it did allow it to take this basic performance to new places. The H-34A had an out-of-ground effect hover ceiling of 5500 feet, whereas the Wessex Mk 5 had one of 10,000 feet at an all-up mass of 5230kg (11,506 lbs). The new helicopter was far safer, smoother and spritely.\n\nA turbojet, the simplest version of a jet engine, passes all the engine airflow through the compressor, burner and turbine. By contrast, later turbofan engines have a ducted fan at the front of the engine, and only a portion of the airflow goes through the core of the engine. This allows better optimisation of the engine and provides better fuel and weight efficiency, lower noise and less pollution.\n\nThe KC-135 originally used four Pratt & Whitney J57 turbojets. The first production turbofan engine, the Rolls-Royce Conway, entered service soon after the KC-135. However, its performance was only marginally better than a turbojet, and an engine retrofit at that time was not justified. Turbofan technology continued over the next twenty years, and it was finally time for an upgrade in the 1980s. And what an upgrade it was...\n\nAn initial upgrade to the Pratt & Whitney TF33 engine was performed on 157 aircraft. This increased the tanker performance (fuel off-loaded and/or mission range) by 20%. The more significant upgrade came in the mid-1980s with the KC-135R model. This upgrade used the CFM56 engine and was applied to a majority of the fleet. The CFM56 produces 22,000 pounds of take-off thrust, a 60% increase over the J57 engine.\n\nThis, along with a few airframe upgrades, allowed for a maximum take-off weight increase, and a significant increase in aircraft performance. Compared to the original A model, the R model can offload nearly 30% more fuel, and its mission radius is increased by 60% or more, depending on fuel offload. Take-off field performance, noise, and emissions are also improved.\n\nIn 1940, Britain was desperate for large numbers of modern fighter aircraft. The US company North American Aviation was approached and asked to build Curtiss P-40s. They believed they could create a far superior design and in response created the P-51.\n\nThe resultant aircraft combined all the latest innovations in aerodynamics to create an exceptionally ‘clean’ low-drag machine. Everything about was designed with low drag in mind, down to the then-novel fully retractable tailwheel. The P-51 was fast, extremely long-ranged and manoeuvrable. But its original Allison V12 engine was less than stellar at medium and higher altitudes.\n\nPairing the most aerodynamically advanced airframe in creation with the best aero-engine in the world, the British Rolls-Royce Merlin V12, was a match made in heaven. An excellent low-level fighter became a superb all-round fighter. Some British historians may claim the re-engining was an entirely British idea, but several engineers in America had also considered this a happy marriage. The Merlin engines for the P-51 were mostly built by Detroit motor giant Packard, under licence.\n\nThe North American P-51 Mustang became a war-winning weapon, able to stay and protect bombers throughout their entire mission. The American fighter’s massive range allowed them free rein over Germany, taking out targets of opportunity once their escort missions were over. The superb P-51 played no small part in the Allies achieving air superiority over Western Europe.\n\nWhen the Italian air force took the C.200 to war, it proved utterly and dangerously outclassed. Its Fiat radial engine generated an unimpressive 870 hp, leaving it underpowered compared to Allied opposition boasting 1000 hp or more powerplants. Poor thinking in the 1930s had led Italy away from adopting powerful inline engines, in favour of uncomplicated radials; in reality, all this thinking had got the Regia Aeronautica was a fighter force too slow to survive.\n\nAware of the mauling Italian fighters were receiving, Italy's General Staff frantically turned to Alfa Romeo and Fiat begging for radials of greater power, but none were forthcoming. In desperation, they turned to their German allies to request licence-production rights for the inline Daimler-Benz DB 601 V12, as used by the formidable Bf 109 and Bf 110.\n\nThe German engine had a far smaller frontal cross-section than the Fiat engine allowing for greater streamlining and far more power. A 601 was fitted to a C.202, and the machine was also given an enclosed cockpit. Thus the ‘Folgore’ was born in 1940, and it was a great machine.\n\nWith a top speed of 372mph, it was as fast or faster than contemporary Spitfires and 109s – and its climb rate was spectacular, and it was also agile and of extremely rugged construction. In North Africa, the Folgore proved a decisively superior fighter to the Kittyhawks, Tomahawks, Hurricanes and Fulmars it faced. Further evolved, and with the addition of the DB 605 it became the C.205 Veltro, one of the best fighters in the world.\n\nThe Grumman F-14 Tomcat is famous as the star (along with Tom Cruise) of the 1986 Top Gun movie. It was a large and capable aeroplane, the ultimate in Grumman’s series of tough fighters able to operate from aircraft carriers. It retired from US service in 2006, but today remains in service with the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force; Iran and America were once friends, in the 1970s, when the planes were purchased.\n\nThe F-14 inherited a curse from the fat wheezy abortive F-111B it was made to replace, the lamentable TF30 engines. The TF30 story goes back even further, as it was originally conceived for the Douglas F6D Missileer a loitering ‘missile-truck’ of an aircraft which never flew.\n\nThe TF30 proved passable for bombers looking to move extremely quickly at low-altitude without the violence of extreme dogfight manoeuvring and found gainful employment with the F-111. But, as a fighter engine it was terrible. Weak, thirsty, smoky, unreliable, pilots of the otherwise excellent Tomcat had to learn to manage these untrustworthy engines.\n\nThe TF30-P-414A solved the reliability issue to some extent but the Tomcat was still underpowered. Eventually, the Tomcat got the engine it needed, with the fitment of the excellent General Electric F110-GE-400. The new Tomcat was an awe-inspiring machine, with performance to match the world-class weapons and sensors it carried.\n\nOf 193 Avro Manchesters that saw service, 123 were lost. It was with good reason that assignment to the Manchester was seen by many in RAF Bomber Command as a death sentence. Mournfully underpowered by two unreliable Vulture engines, loss of power in one engine - an all-too-common event - was often disastrous.\n\nUp to February 1942, the average amount of serviceable Manchesters at once never exceeded 31. When the Manchesters were not grounded or catching fire in flight, there were cases of hydraulic fluid spraying into the cockpit and temporarily blinding the crew.\n\nThe Manchester was introduced in November 1940, and sensibly put out to pasture in 1942. The replacement of the two troublesome Vultures with four V12 Rolls-Royce Merlins, showed the true promise of the airframe and merited a name change, to Lancaster. The famous Lancaster was more than a re-engined Manchester, but was not that much more. In fact, the prototype Lancaster was a conversion of the earlier twin-engined bomber and was initially known as the Manchester III.\n\nThe obvious change was the addition of two extra engines, but there was also a larger wing, general beefing up and a new undercarriage. Despite these changes, it is absolutely fair to describe the Lancaster as a new ‘Manc’. The result was spectacular, and the mediocre Manchester became the devastatingly effective Lancaster, complete with an enormous bombload of 6363kg (14,000 lbs), much greater than the 3600kg (8000 lbs) of the B-17 - its American partner in the Allied bombing offensive against Germany.\n\nFollow Joe Coles on Substack, Twitter X  or Blue Sky.

    "fullText": "Detectives say tools supplied by Palantir were integral to convictions of a criminal gang that stole £800,000\n\nIt was fraud on a grand scale. The “Fuck the Police” criminal gang based in Luton and Romania stole £800,000 in more than 3,000 withdrawals from cash machines in dozens of locations throughout 2024.\n\nThe police investigation matched the crime in its complexity. When detectives in Bedfordshire seized the suspects’ two dozen smartphones, they were faced with a mountain of potential digital evidence – 1.4 terabytes of information, according to the authorities, connecting co-conspirators across eastern England and the Bacau region of Romania.\n\nAlongside human intelligence, forensics and the other mainstays of traditional policing, detectives increasingly face dauntingly vast reservoirs of digital information that could contain vital clues.\n\nThe data haul, which covered messages, geolocation positions, emails, notes and photographs, was equivalent to about 500,000 ebooks and would ordinarily take months, if not years, to comb through.\n\nIt was then that the detectives of the Eastern Region Special Operations Unit reached for new AI tools, supplied by the controversial US tech company Palantir, co-founded by the Trump-supporting billionaire Peter Thiel. Palantir has more than £500m in high-profile contracts with the NHS and the Ministry of Defence. But it is also providing AI investigation tools to 11 police forces, and the government last month pledged to invest more than £115m in the “rapid and responsible development, testing and rollout of AI tools” across all 43 forces in England and Wales, including creating Police.AI: a new national centre for AI in policing.\n\nIn the cashpoint case, the AI system – known as Nectar – unlocked the trove. It read and translated more than 100,000 messages, drew charts connecting suspects, analysed their movements, combed pictures and texts for suggestions of crimes and alerted detectives to potential leads. Human policing led to the arrests which then saw six men jailed in November, but without the AI, the detectives would still be digging through the evidence mountain now, the force said.\n\n“It’s not Robocop,” said Dan James, the programme manager at the unit. “It’s about how we can make our investigators more efficient.”\n\nBut the use of Palantir’s AI technology in policing has caused concern. Last year, documents showed the intention was to “assist with decision making” and “aid in the prevention, detection and investigation of crimes”. Data the AI system processed included political and religious opinions. Last week, Shockat Adam, the MP for Leicester South called on ministers to provide greater transparency about another Palantir contract with Leicestershire police, which he called “dystopian”. The Lib Dem MP Martin Wrigley called for UK AI companies to be encouraged to bid for police AI contracts and Liberty, the civil liberties campaign group, has called for the government to install “a system of strong guardrails” before police forces deploy more AI.\n\nFor Bedfordshire police, the most immediate benefit offered by its Palantir-enabled system in the cash point case was the translation of the phones’ contents from the suspects’ native Romanian.\n\n“We did 100,000 messages in a day,” said an official, requesting anonymity. “We would have been waiting weeks, if not months for that translation to be done.”\n\nHuman translation would have cost £30,000, and in the time taken to complete the translation, suspects in custody might have been bailed, released under investigation or absconded from the country, requiring re-arrests.\n\nThe AI system scanned texts for clues about other crimes and, in the cashpoint case, it identified about 120 potential offences. “If they’re talking about drugs, they’re talking about ATMs, if they’re talking about guns [the AI] highlights them,” they said.\n\nThe AI is trained to recognise images of cocaine and cannabis and reads all the texts and messages in a phone and tries to “understand them against UK law”. The technology is also able to help detectives put together a more accurate picture of suspects’ movements than would otherwise be possible, but the officials declined to elaborate on how this was done.\n\nThe system also creates live association charts – not dissimilar to photo pinboards familiar from TV dramas – that are constantly updated as new information arrives.\n\n“You’re able to click on [a person and see they are] linked to that person through this and it explains why,” said James. “It’s really efficient and it stays up to date.”\n\nAt present, the AI tools are only used for investigation and AI outputs are not used directly in prosecutions, although that is a goal that could be achieved in the future.\n\n“People could be lazy and people will get lazy,” said James. “So we need to make sure that … the AI’s suggestion is affirmed by a person.”\n\nThe force said Palantir does not hold or have access to any of its data and its AI tools cannot learn from it.",

    "fullText": "Facebook owner’s investment described by semiconductor company as ‘big bet’ on artificial intelligence\n\nThe owner of Facebook has agreed to buy $60bn (£44.5bn) of artificial intelligence chips from the US semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices despite fears over the vast sums being spent on the AI industry.\n\nMeta, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, has clinched the five-year deal in which it will also buy 10% of the chip company.\n\nAMD signed a similar pact with OpenAI last year, which was hailed as a vote of confidence in its chips and software, significantly boosting its stock price.\n\nA recent series of chip supply agreements underscores the AI industry’s appetite for processors. Meta has separately struck a deal with AMD’s larger rival Nvidia to buy millions of AI chips.\n\nAMD would supply 6GW worth of chips to Meta, starting with 1GW of the company’s forthcoming MI450 hardware in the second half of this year, said AMD’s chief executive, Lisa Su.\n\nIn addition to AMD’s flagship graphics chips (GPUs), Meta also plans to buy central processors (CPUs), including a variant that will be customised for the social media platform’s needs.\n\nThe custom CPU would be tuned to deliver powerful performance while keeping energy consumption as low as possible, Su said. The deal will include two generations of AMD’s CPUs.\n\n“So no question Mark is very, very ambitious in what he wants to accomplish, and we want to use every aspect of our technology to really help Meta to accomplish that,” Su said, referring to Meta’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. “Meta is making a big bet on AMD.”\n\nMeta contributed to the MI450 design, which is optimised for a computing process known as inference – when a chatbot such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT responds to a user’s queries.\n\nIndustry analysts expect the market for inference hardware to dwarf the size of the market for the equipment needed to train large AI models.\n\nMeta planned to continue to buy chips from other vendors and develop its in-house processors at the same time, said Santosh Janardhan, the company’s infrastructure head. Meta has been in discussions with Google about using the company’s tensor processors (TPUs) for AI work, Reuters reported.\n\nThe scale at which Meta was building datacentres and infrastructure required multiple chip vendors and approaches, Janardhan said.\n\n“All of the chipmakers end up having sort of a seat at the table,” Janardhan added.",

    "fullText": "An entire Eastern Shore town was without power Monday as widespread outages hit the region after a heavy snowstorm.\n\nA Delmarva Power outage map showed nearly 1,000 outages Monday morning, affecting more than 6% of the utility’s 550,000 customers in Maryland and Delaware. Choptank Electric Cooperative reported nearly 27% of its 57,000 customers were without power as of early Monday.\n\nBerlin Mayor Zack Tyndall took to Facebook to provide an update early Monday morning. Tyndall said the town lost power at roughly 9 p.m. Sunday.\n\nBerlin is unique on the Eastern Shore in that it operates its own municipal electric utility, serving local homes and businesses directly. The town generates some electricity at a small power plant on William Street but purchases most of its power from outside suppliers. That electricity is delivered into Berlin through the regional transmission grid, which in much of the area is operated by Delmarva Power.\n\nTyndall said the issue, in this case, was with Delmarva Power.\n\n“Town crews have spent the evening working to clear down trees and wires, plow the streets, and fix issues related to the storm and power outage,” Tyndall wrote. “Unfortunately, the source of the issue is not a Berlin Electric issue but an issue with electricity coming into town from Delmarva Power.”\n\nTyndall asked for patience as town crews and Delmarva Power worked to restore service.\n\nHe also urged residents to stay off the streets.\n\n“You will get stuck and cause a strain on town resources,” he said. “This storm has caused extremely high snow drifts and areas that have been impossible to keep clear due to heavy winds. Leaving your house poses not only a risk for you but our town staff and local first responders who will have to come rescue you.”\n\nTyndall told The Baltimore Sun Delmarva Power crews hope to restore service by noon Monday.\n\nDelmarva Power did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHave a news tip?

    "fullText": "TikTok creators are going viral by pretending the upcoming iPhone 18 ships with a bizarre new MagSafe-style charging cord—but the entire premise is a joke.\n\nThe fake charger, which appears bulkier and more proprietary than USB-C, is part of a hoax trend riffing on Apple’s controversial 2023 switch away from Lightning cables.\n\nFalse rumors about the upcoming iPhone18’s proprietary charging mechanism spread like wildfire after a cryptic animation of the phone’s charging port was shared on Feb. 1, 2026.\n\nThe animation shows a charger similar to the MagSafe connector that appears on newer MacBooks, featuring a chunkier form factor with three pins, instead of five.\n\nThe video went viral with over 18 million views, sparking a slew of reaction videos from TikTok creators pretending to unbox the eccentric, new cord.\n\nAfter 11 years with the Lightning connector, Apple switched to USB-C charging ports on iPhones in 2023 to meet standards dictated by EU regulations for smartphones and personal connectivity needs.\n\nAt the time, the switch sparked frustration among Apple users reluctant to purchase new chargers to accommodate the update. But according to industry experts, USB-C is here to stay.\n\nUSB-C supports fast charging and high-speed data transfer. It’s a universal, reversible, and highly versatile standard used around the world.\n\n@3milio._.cl’s post about the rumored iPhone18 charger racked up over 13.4 million views.\n\nDistressed TikTok creator @leorealtoks showed off a MagSafe charger in a clip with onscreen text that read, “Why did my new phone come with this charger?”\n\n@hen71181 kept the hoax going with a clip of a two-pin, magnetic charging cord.

The standard iPhone 18 and iPhone 18e models are projected to drop in spring 2027.

    "fullText": "On Tuesday, the United States Supreme Court heard arguments on behalf of  Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and Enbridge Energy on whether the state’s case to shut down the Line 5 pipeline should be heard in state or federal court.\n\nAt issue? Whether there are exceptions to the 30-day time limit to have a matter removed from state court to be heard in federal court.\n\nNessel first filed suit against the Canadian Pipeline company in 2019, though the case has yet to be resolved as years of legal maneuvering have moved the matter from state court to federal court and back.\n\nIn 2024, Nessel successfully argued that Enbridge had exceeded its 30-day time limit to have the case removed to federal court, with the company filing its request after more than a year of litigation. However, Enbridge maintains that U.S. district courts can excuse the time limit, leaving the Court to determine whether they hold this authority.\n\nFollowing arguments from Enbridge attorney John Bursch, Justice Clarence Thomas questioned why this case wasn’t removed to federal court like a similar suit filed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who voluntarily dismissed the case.\n\nNew: State shifts strategy on Line 5, drops federal case\n\nBursch explained that while the cases were similar, the Canadian government invoked a 1977 treaty concerning international pipelines in Whitmer’s case while a federal judge was weighing whether the matter should be heard in state or federal court.\n\nWhile it wasn’t clear whether Nessel’s initial case was within federal jurisdiction at the outset, the governor’s decision to terminate Enbridge’s right to operate Line 5 on the bottomlands of the Great Lakes and Canada’s treaty invocation changed the lay of the land.\n\nAfter Whitmer’s case was dismissed and Nessel announced she would move forward with her case at the state level, Bursch said the company filed its notice to remove the case to federal court within 15 days.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor asked what rights Enbridge is losing by having the matter heard in state court as opposed to federal court. \n\n “You have a right to have recovery for a loss or a potential loss, and the forum where that right is adjudicated is not lost,” Sotomayor said. “You have a forum, you have the state court. None of your remedies, like in some of our other cases, would be lost forever. None of your claims or defenses would be lost forever.”\n\nIn response Bursch pointed to two other Supreme Court cases where parties had lost the right to a particular legal mechanism to enforce their argument arguing that they were losing their right to have the case removed under similar conditions.\n\nLater in the hearing Justice Neil Gorsuch asked Bursch why Enbridge wanted to have the matter heard in federal court.\n\nThere are four reasons, Bursch explained. First, he argued there is value in having a case heard in a forum that respects federal authority. Second, Bursch said federal courts are uniquely qualified to decide matters of federal common law and foreign affairs.\n\nEnbridge would also like to have the option for the Supreme Court to be able to weigh in if an order to shut down the pipeline is upheld, and it has a separate case against the governor in federal court, Bursch explained.\n\nGorsuch probed further, asking whether Enbridge felt it could receive a fair trial in state court.\n\nWhile Bursch said state courts likely hadn’t dealt much with federal common law in the jurisdiction of foreign affairs, Gorsuch said the issue doesn’t often come up in federal district court either.\n\nGorsuch posed a similar question to Michigan Solicitor General Ann Sherman, asking if there’s a reason why the plaintiff would prefer to have the matter resolved in state court.\n\nSherman noted that the case was brought by a state official, addressing concerns of state law as to whether or not Enbridge had violated the state’s public trust doctrine, which determines that the state has a duty to manage natural resources for the benefit of the public.\n\nCongress has given legal parties a choice of forum, with Nessel, the plaintiff given the first choice of forum, Sherman said. Congress has also given the defense an opportunity to select a federal forum, Sherman said, arguing that if Enbridge thought the matter should have been heard in federal court, it should have responded in a timely manner.\n\nShe also argued that Congress had not given federal courts exclusive authority over matters of foreign affairs, and that even if the scope of the case goes beyond state law and into treaty matters, the state court can be trusted to handle it with the Supreme Court as a backdrop.\n\nJustice Sotomayor noted that a federal court had recently ruled in Enbridge’s favor, determining that federal law bars the state from ending Enbridge’s Line 5 easement. If the Supreme Court affirms the Sixth Circuit Court’s decision, leaving Nessel’s case in state court, there would be lawsuits relating to Line 5 in both state and federal court, she noted.\n\n“If you were to win here, are you willing to commit that you will ask the state court to continue its stay pending resolution of the federal action?” Sotomayor asked.\n\nWhile it was not something she’d discussed with Nessel, Sherman said it was certainly a strategic decision they could discuss.\n\nLine 5 is a 645-mile long pipeline stretching from Superior, Wis. to Sarnia, Ontario, transporting up to 23 million gallons of crude oil and natural gas liquids every day. A four mile segment of dual pipelines runs through the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Michigan and Lake Huron meet.\n\nMichigan’s 12 federally-recognized Tribal Nations and a number of environmental advocacy groups have called for the more than 70 year old pipeline to be decommissioned, raising concerns of an oil spill that deepened when Line 5 was struck by an anchor in 2018 and 2020.\n\nIn a statement Friday morning, Enbridge spokesperson Michael Barnes said the company was encouraged that the Supreme Court had agreed to review the case. He argued that the federal government holds the sole authority to regulate the pipeline, and that the case holds significant concerns for both energy security and foreign affairs.\n\nIn addition to Nessel’s case, the Whitmer administration has also asked the high court to determine whether the state is immune from the suit Enbridge filed against Whitmer and the director of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources for revoking its easement to operate Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac.\n\nThis story is breaking and will be updated with additional information.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump, who has excoriated the U.S.",
    "fullText": "Feb 24 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, who has excoriated the U.S. Supreme Court's decision striking down his sweeping tariffs, is expected to come face-to-face with at least some of the justices when he delivers his State of the Union address on Tuesday night.\n\nThe annual address, which has created uncomfortable moments for Supreme Court justices in the past, ‌could highlight the tensions between Trump and the three conservative justices who joined its three liberal members in the 6-3 ruling on Friday: Chief Justice John Roberts, Neil Gorsuch and Amy ‌Coney Barrett.\n\nThe Republican president appointed Gorsuch in 2017 and Barrett in 2020 during his first term in office. Roberts has served as chief justice for more than two decades since being appointed by Republican former President George W. Bush in 2005.\n\nAfter the ruling was ​issued on Friday, Trump denounced the court and the six justices who ruled against him. The court in the decision found that Trump had exceeded his powers by bypassing Congress and imposing the tariffs under a U.S. law meant for use in national emergencies.\n\nTrump said he was \"ashamed\" of the three conservative justices who ruled against him, calling them \"fools and lapdogs for the RINOs and the radical-left Democrats.\" RINO, meaning \"Republican in name only,\" is a term sometimes used by conservative Republicans to insult fellow Republicans viewed as disloyal to the party.\n\nGorsuch and Barrett, Trump said, were \"an embarrassment to their families\" for ruling against him on tariffs. Trump also alleged, without providing evidence, ‌that the court has been \"swayed by foreign interests.\"\n\nTrump, though, lauded the three ⁠justices who ruled in his favor, with high praise in particular for his 2018 appointee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nSupreme Court justices often attend the State of the Union address, and some of the current nine are expected to be present inside the U.S. House of Representatives chamber for Trump's speech to a joint session of Congress. The ⁠court has not yet said which justices will attend on Tuesday.\n\nCustomarily, justices who attend wear their judicial robes and typically sit expressionless.\n\nThe attendance of the justices \"sends a message of stability\" and \"conveys that these aren't enemy institutions,\" Brown University political science professor Corey Brettschneider said.\n\nIn an address to Congress last year, Trump clasped Roberts by the hand, patted him on the shoulder, and told him: \"Thank you again. I won't forget.\"\n\nThe remark came in the aftermath of a 2024 Supreme Court ​decision ​authored by Roberts granting Trump, who had faced criminal charges while out of office, broad immunity from prosecution for ​official acts as president. Trump later said he was thanking Roberts for swearing him ‌at his inauguration.\n\nFour justices attended Trump's last formal State of the Union in 2020.\n\nRoberts has attended every State of the Union address since joining the Supreme Court, even though he has publicly questioned why he bothers.\n\n\"The image of having the members of one branch of government standing up, literally surrounding the Supreme Court, cheering and hollering, while the court, according to the requirements of protocol, has to sit there expressionless, I think is very troubling,\" Roberts said during a 2010 speech at the University of Alabama, according to media reports.\n\n\"To the extent the State of the Union has degenerated into a political pep rally,\" Roberts added, \"I'm not sure why we're there.\"\n\nRoberts made those remarks after Democratic President Barack Obama during his State of the Union address criticized a Supreme Court ruling striking down certain campaign finance limits, saying it would \"open the floodgates\" ‌to unlimited corporate and potentially foreign money in U.S. elections.\n\nConservative Justice Samuel Alito, present for the speech, reacted by ​shaking his head and appearing to mouth \"not true,\" a departure from the traditionally impassive demeanor of the justices.\n\nAlito has shunned the ​State of the Union ever since, calling it a \"very awkward\" tradition.\n\nIn a 2015 interview with the ​American Spectator, a conservative news outlet, Alito indicated that justices may be placed in a difficult position attending State of the Union addresses.\n\n\"Every once in a while the ‌president will say something that is nonpartisan,\" Alito said. \"We look foolish sitting there, ​so we stand up and start to applaud. And ​then we'll get faked out. The president will get say, 'This is a great country' - and everyone will stand up and start to applaud - 'because we're gonna do this, we're gonna enact this legislation.' It's a very odd experience.\"\n\nThe late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia also had a policy of skipping the speech, which he once called a \"childish spectacle.\"\n\nDemocratic President Joe Biden during his 2024 State of the ​Union address looked directly at the justices who were present and admonished ‌them over the court's 2022 ruling that rolled back abortion rights.\n\n\"With all due respect, justices, women are not without ... electoral or political power,\" Biden said.\n\nThe last time all nine members ​of the court missed a State of the Union address was in 2000, near the end of Democratic President Bill Clinton's second term. The court, in a public statement ​at the time, attributed the absences to \"travel changes and minor illnesses.\"",

    "fullText": "600 people spent a night trapped on board parked airplanes at Munich Airport.\n\nHeavy snowfall stopped them from taking off, and other cancellations meant gates were full.\n\nTemperatures dropped below freezing overnight as passengers tried to rest.\n\nHundreds of people spent a snowy and freezing night trapped on board parked airplanes last Thursday.\n\nSix flights, with around 600 passengers total, were unable to take off before Munich Airport's 1 a.m. curfew due to the bad weather, the airport said in a Monday statement.\n\nThe airport police department has prepared a report on the incident, which is set to be submitted to the public prosecutor on Tuesday, Sven Otto, chief inspector for the Upper Bavaria North Police, told Business Insider.\n\nHe added that no complaints have yet been filed with the police by affected passengers.\n\nAround 100 flights were canceled in Munich on Thursday, and temperatures dropped to 30 degrees Fahrenheit. There were long lines to de-ice planes, while runways were periodically closed at short notice to clear the heavy snowfall, the airport said.\n\nMunich, Europe's 10th-busiest airport, typically shuts at midnight, but it received a permit that day to operate an hour later.\n\nWhen the six flights couldn't depart on time, there was no space left to park at the terminal due to all the cancellations, the airport said.\n\nHowever, the passengers couldn't be transported to the terminal because \"bus service was severely restricted\" due to \"the late hour and communication problems,\" it added.\n\nA spokesperson for Lufthansa, the German flag carrier, said \"it took hours\" before buses could pick up the passengers.\n\nFive of the flights were operated by Germany's Lufthansa Group, two of which were with its subsidiary, Air Dolomiti, it said. The other plane belonged to Air Arabia, a budget airline based in the UAE, according to the airport. Air Arabia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe airport said that airlines \"provided the passengers with the best possible care on the aircraft.\" Although those on board spoke of their distress.\n\n\"There was no food or drink for us. There were no blankets for us either,\" Søren Thieme, who was on one of the Lufthansa planes, told Ekstra Bladet, a Danish newspaper that first reported the incident.\n\nHe said passengers on the canceled flight to Copenhagen asked if they could enter the airport, but they were told it was forbidden, and that all the bus drivers had gone home.\n\n\"We're simply trapped here, along with the staff, too,\" he told the newspaper.\n\nThe Lufthansa spokesperson said, \"The crews kept passengers informed and provided them with the catering available on board, as far as possible. All aircraft were heated and had sufficient power.\"\n\nThey added that they sincerely apologized to the passengers and will give them \"appropriate compensation payments.\"\n\n\"Together with our partners at Munich Airport, we are doing everything we can to ensure that such mistakes do not happen again.\"\n\nMunich Airport said it \"apologized expressly\" to the affected passengers.\n\n\"Our top priority is always the safety and satisfaction of our passengers, and these incidents do not meet our standards.\"",

    "fullText": "Jeffrey Epstein had at least six storage units throughout the country where he hid materials that were apparently never searched.\n\nDocuments obtained by The Telegraph reportedly show the late pedophile kept up payments on the lockers right up until his death in police custody in 2019. He apparently used the lockers to stash away computers from his private island residence and items from his other properties.\n\n“Search warrants reviewed by The Telegraph suggest U.S. authorities never raided the lockers, raising the possibility that they may contain unseen evidence relating to Epstein and his associates,” the newspaper writes.\n\nThe revelations heap further pressure on Attorney General Pam Bondi amid a firestorm of criticism over what’s widely regarded as the Justice Department’s botched release of 3 million documents on the disgraced financier’s crimes.\n\nBondi attended a congressional hearing earlier this month where she came under repeated fire for redactions to those files. Critics accuse the department of omitting names and details to protect Epstein’s accomplices, rather than his victims.\n\nMultiple committee members asked the attorney general to apologize to survivors after their information was made public. She instead accused lawmakers of “theatrics” and used a cheat-sheet to level insults at those who questioned her.\n\nEpstein died in 2019 while in police custody awaiting trial on charges stemming from what is now one of the most notorious sex trafficking conspiracies in history.\n\nPresident Donald Trump—himself once a close friend of the late pedophile—has long fueled conspiracy theories about Epstein’s crimes that are popular among the MAGA base.\n\nThese include rumors that the financier kept compromising material on his associates for blackmail purposes or, by some accounts, on behalf of foreign intelligence agencies.\n\nThe president has denied having any knowledge of or involvement in Epstein’s crimes.\n\nEarlier this month, the newspaper reported Epstein had previously instructed staff to conceal cameras in boxes of tissues at home after a contact had suggested “the Russians may come in handy.”\n\n“The emails the DOJ released, along with the financial records The Telegraph has unearthed revealing the secret storage units, raise the possibility that they housed compromising material,” the newspaper wrote Monday.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the Justice Department for comment. The FBI told The Telegraph it has no evidence Epstein kept compromising material on members of his circle.\n\nEmails from the latest tranche of DOJ documents apparently suggest Epstein told private detectives to transfer computers to one of his storage units after he seemed to have been tipped off ahead of a police-raid on one of his Florida homes in 2005.\n\nHe later appears to have instructed staff to move computers from Little St James, his private island in the Caribbean, into storage, and to wipe any materials they contained.",

    "description": "New Idaho autopsy findings suggest Bryan Kohberger may have had one intended target, exposing a disturbing fantasy behind the attack.",
    "fullText": "The horror inside 1122 King Road has never faded from public memory. On November 13, 2022, four University of Idaho students were slaughtered in an attack investigators say unfolded in just 15 minutes.\n\nNow, months after Bryan Kohberger began serving life behind bars, newly released autopsy findings are shedding disturbing new light on what truly happened and why.\n\nAccording to one forensic psychologist, the wounds themselves may expose Kohberger's chilling, deeply personal motive.\n\nBryan Kohberger stabbed Madison Mogen, Kaylee Goncalves, Xana Kernodle, and Ethan Chapin more than 150 times combined, according to newly unsealed autopsy records.\n\nThe attack began after he entered the off-campus home through a rear sliding door and went straight upstairs. Mogen and Goncalves, both 21, were asleep in the same bed.\n\nEach died from multiple sharp-force injuries. Goncalves suffered at least 38 stab wounds, including devastating injuries to her head, neck, and chest, as well as blunt-force trauma and signs of asphyxiation.\n\nMogen sustained 28 stab wounds, including fatal injuries to vital organs and blood vessels. Forensic psychologist Dr. Gary Brucato believes the pattern matters.\n\n\"This was a targeted psychosexual fantasy probably aimed at one individual in the house,\" he told the Daily Mail.\n\nIn his view, the violence was not random but part of a deeply distorted plan.\n\nInvestigators have long suspected that Bryan Kohberger did not plan to kill four people that night.\n\nEvidence suggests he went directly to the third-floor bedroom, fueling speculation that either Mogen or Goncalves was his intended target.\n\nWhile some might assume the victim with the most wounds was the focus, Brucato sees it differently. \"There is a school of thought that would say the person with more wounds might be the object of passion and therefore the target,\" he explained. \"So some people would think Kaylee was the target.\"\n\nHowever, Brucato believes otherwise. He said, \"But my belief is he went in and made a beeline for Maddie [Mogen], who was his target, and found Kaylee unexpectedly there.\"\n\nHe argues the comparatively lower number of wounds on Mogen suggests she was attacked first in a more controlled manner, while Goncalves endured greater fury after disrupting the plan.\n\n\"That's why you see so much rage towards Kaylee. I think Maddie was the primary target, and Kaylee was not supposed to be there,\" he said.\n\nThe violence intensified downstairs. Twenty-year-old Kernodle was awake, scrolling TikTok and having just received a DoorDash order.\n\nBlood on the soles of her feet indicates she stepped in her own blood while fighting back.\n\nKernodle suffered 67 stab wounds, the highest number of any victim. Chapin sustained 17 wounds, the fewest overall.\n\nBrucato believes Kernodle's resistance shattered Kohberger's control, noting that she made a mockery of his fantasy.\n\n\"He went in there thinking he was going to destroy and dominate a woman, and a woman saw him and fought with him. So he was furious with her,\" the psychologist added.\n\nBrucato further explained that becoming disorganized because of a situation out of one's control could result in \"a frenzied thrashing out at a person who is fighting.\"\n\nAccording to him, Kohberger overestimated himself and underestimated women.\n\nCourt records show Bryan Kohberger's cell phone pinged near the home at least 23 times before the murders, mostly at night. Investigators believe he was surveilling the house and may have even entered it previously.\n\nDigital forensics later uncovered disturbing online searches. Experts found queries related to \"sleeping,\" \"passed out,\" \"voyeur,\" \"forced,\" \"raped,\" and \"drugged.\" He also showed interest in serial killers and home invasions.\n\nBrucato described his mindset in unsettling terms. \"He was probably obsessively watching his victim from afar and thought he knew everything about the movement of this foreign body - almost scientifically - but could never touch it. He could never have a conversation with her,\" he said.\n\nBrucato revealed that something was odd about how Kohberger related to human beings.\n\nAccording to him, the killer understood them in a mechanical, detached way, thinking of people almost like insects in a jar.\n\nUnsealed documents also raise questions about whether any victims were repositioned or whether the killer attempted to clean up before fleeing.\n\nWhile some details remain disputed, Brucato noted that posing a body or taking a trophy can be done \"for arousal or so that you can remember it a certain way.\"\n\nTo him, the motive is unmistakable. \"When the motive is fantasy, you have to keep doing it to get the fantasy perfect. He was motivated like a serial killer,\" Brucato said.\n\nHe added, \"I doubt that he had ever killed before, but let's just say, if he had not been captured, I have no doubt that after a period of time, he would have had more victims - and I think he would have gotten better.\"",

    "description": "The cause of death for CHP Officer Miguel Cano was revealed to be an accident due to fentanyl. Cano died in Culver City in July when he crashed his patrol car shortly after arresting a DUI suspect.",
    "fullText": "Shortly after administering Narcan to a DUI suspect experiencing a possible overdose, CHP Officer Miguel Cano started to feel unwell, swerved his patrol car into a tree and was killed. His sudden death left many questions unanswered.\n\nOn Monday, one piece of the puzzle was revealed — his cause of death was ruled an accident due to the effects of fentanyl, according to the L.A. County medical examiner.\n\nBut exactly how Cano ingested a lethal amount of fentanyl remains unclear. A spokesperson for the CHP said that, out of respect for Cano's family and the integrity of the review process, the agency was refraining from commenting until it had \"thoroughly examined\" the medical examiner's report.\n\nCano, a 34-year-old from Moreno Valley, had been driving in Culver City around 12:30 a.m. on July 2 when he suffered a medical emergency resulting in a crash, according to a July statement from the California Highway Patrol.\n\nHe and his partner had just taken a DUI suspect into custody, and the three of them were driving to the nearby West L.A. CHP office. The suspect was also allegedly in possession of a firearm, possible cocaine and drug paraphernalia.\n\nFearing the suspect could be overdosing, Cano had administered Narcan, a nasal spray that reverses the effects of opioids. While en route to the office, Cano told his partner he didn't feel well.\n\nTheir vehicle went off the roadway and struck a tree. Cano was rushed to UCLA Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead around 1:40 a.m. The suspect and the other officer survived the crash without severe injury.\n\nIn July, the CHP said that the agency's accident investigation team was leading a probe into the incident but that investigators had already ruled out a possible exposure to drugs.\n\n“We do not think this was an exposure to drugs,” CHP Commissioner Sean Duryee said in July. “The other officer and the subject did not experience any signs or symptoms related to that.”\n\nFentanyl is an incredibly potent synthetic opioid that can be fatal in very small doses. However, a person cannot be killed simply by coming into physical contact with the substance.\n\n\"It is a common misconception that fentanyl can be absorbed through the skin, but it is not true for casual exposure,\" according to Dr. Daniel Colby, co-medical director for the Department of Emergency Medicine at UC Davis Health. \"The one case in which fentanyl can be absorbed through the skin is with a special doctor-prescribed fentanyl skin patch, and even then, it takes hours of exposure.\"\n\nColby said it is important for people to understand that fentanyl cannot be absorbed through contact, so that they are not fearful to intervene when witnessing an overdose.\n\n\"Pausing or waiting for other people to arrive means that person might die,\" he said. \"They need our help and it is safe to help them.\"\n\nCano's death was the first line-of-duty death for the CHP since 2020. Gov. Newsom called the death \"a heartbreaking loss for the state and the California Highway Patrol.\" The officer graduated from the CHP Academy in 2023 and was survived by his wife and parents.\n\n“We are devastated by the loss of Officer Cano, who gave his life while serving the people of California,” said Duryee at the time of Cano's death. “His dedication, courage and commitment to public safety will never be forgotten.\"\n\nTimes staff writer Jasmine Mendez contributed to this report.\n\nA.

    "description": "In about a year, Ukraine has turned the interceptor drones from an engineering novelty into a mass-produced foundation of its air defense.",
    "fullText": "30% of Russian air threats downed over Ukraine were hit by interceptor drones, a top commander said.\n\nIt's a further sign of how the novel, inexpensive technology is growing in the country.\n\nUkraine said in December that it was producing nearly 1,000 of these drones per day.\n\nUkraine's interceptor drones now account for almost a third of the Russian aerial threats destroyed, a top officer in the country's branch for uncrewed air defenses said.\n\n\"If we take into account the share of interceptor UAVs in the destruction of air targets, we have already reached the mark of 30%,\" said Col. Yuriy Cherevashenka in a video interview published on Monday by Ukraine's air force.\n\n\"That is, every third drone target that is destroyed in Ukraine is destroyed by an interceptor UAV,\" he added.\n\nHis comments signal a milestone in the Ukrainian use of interceptor drones. These are typically small, inexpensive quadcopters optimized to fly fast enough to catch Russian one-way attack drones.\n\nThese air defense drones were an emerging novelty in the earlier years of the war, but Ukraine began accelerating their development in late 2024 as a cost-effective answer to Moscow ramping up its regular drone attacks on Ukrainian cities.\n\nA year later, Ukrainian officials said in December that the country was producing 950 interceptor drones per day.\n\nRussia launches thousands of long-range drones into Ukraine every month, and has been known to sometimes accumulate over 800 of them to attack in a single night. Its most common attack drone is a locally built version of the Iranian Shahed loitering munition.\n\nInterceptor drones are built to destroy these aerial threats by ramming into them or deploying an explosive warhead. Much of a successful interception relies on the skill of the pilot and crew, who must spot the Shahed quickly, approach its trajectory, track its position, and then fly their drone into the Russian device.\n\nNot all interceptors are quadcopters, but many are designed with four propellers and a dome-like frame to reach extreme speeds, since the typical Shahed can reach up to 115 mph, while more advanced versions are estimated to reach 230 mph.\n\nCherevashenka said that Ukrainian officials initially worried about dealing with 350 Shahed attacks a month.\n\nNow, however, it's common for Ukraine to fight 350 Shahed attacks per day, he added.\n\n\"Compared to 2022, when the first drone arrived in September over Kyiv, it had a 40-kilogram warhead and was a primitive drone flying by coordinates,\" the colonel said. \"Now, we have 14 types of warheads for the strike drones of the Russian Federation.\"\n\nCherevashenka further warned that Russia has been incorporating artificial intelligence into its Shaheds and is known to use mesh networks to guide them.\n\nEarlier this year, Ukraine reported that Russian troops were regularly accessing Starlink networks via black market terminals, including to guide Shahed attack drones. The complaints prompted SpaceX to cut connectivity over the war zone and allow access only to terminals on an official Ukrainian whitelist.\n\n\"We understand that this is not the end, that they will increase their capabilities,\" Cherevashenka said of Russia's drone industry. \"Moreover, this year they have invested in the production of twice as many drones as last year.\"\n\nInterceptor drones form just one part of Ukraine's multi-layered air defense network. The country also commonly deploys truck-mounted machine-gun crews to shoot down Shaheds, reserving interceptor munitions for higher priority threats, such as Russian cruise or ballistic missiles.",

    "description": "Investor fears over private credit have reached the desk of the Treasury secretary.",
    "fullText": "Pressure on Blue Owl Capital (OWL) isn't letting up after an asset sale meant to calm investor worries last week sparked new concern from top government officials about the $1.8 trillion private credit industry.\n\n\"We are concerned,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Friday when asked about the growth of Blue Owl and other private lenders over recent years. \"If there is something rotten, it is not going to be handed to the individual investors,\" Bessent said.\n\nHow are analysts viewing Blue Owl's loan sale decision?\n\nWhy did Treasury Secretary Bessent express concern about Blue Owl?\n\nWhat risks exist from private credit industry interconnectedness?\n\nWhat was Blue Owl's $1.4 billion asset sale strategy?\n\nLast Wednesday, Blue Owl said it sold $1.4 billion in loans and lending commitments from three of its funds, with some proceeds used to repay investors 30% of their capital from the oldest of those private credit funds, known as Blue Owl Development Corporation II (OBDC II), which is winding down after scrapping a planned merger late last year.\n\nBut what drew outsized attention was Blue Owl's decision to eliminate the optionality for investors to cash out of OBDC II on a quarterly basis and instead institute a program of quarterly capital distributions based on the fund's future earnings and asset sales.\n\nThe move drew fresh scrutiny to the opaque world of private debt, which has boomed in recent years but has never truly faced a crisis — and is now garnering mounting scrutiny as it is gradually making its way into millions of US brokerage and retirement accounts following an executive order President Trump signed last summer.\n\nBlue Owl's stock fell 5% Monday morning.\n\nWall Street analysts, who generally approved of Blue Owl's loan sale, still aren't worried about the firm or the wider private credit industry having significant credit problems.\n\n\"We don't believe there is a serious concern about a deterioration in private credit quality,\" Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Kotowski said last week Blue Owl's sale \"should have been greeted favorably,\" adding that the marginal haircut of 99.7% on the dollar for the sold loans served as proof that private loan valuations \"reflect market realities.\"\n\nBlue Owl co-CEO Marc Lipschultz said earlier this month the company sees no \"red flags\" in the credit quality of its software-tied loans. \"We don't have yellow flags. We actually have largely green flags,\" he told analysts.\n\nOne aspect of Blue Owl's sale did raise some eyebrows, as Bloomberg reported one of the buyers for its assets included Kuvare, a insurance focused asset manager Blue Owl acquired in 2024. Like Blue Owl, Apollo (APO), Ares (ARES), Blackstone (BX), KKR & Co. (KKR), and other major private credit lenders own insurance companies.

    "fullText": "John Aldridge has said that he was ‘shouting at the television’ on Sunday over Arne Slot’s decision to start Dominik Szoboszlai out of position at right-back in Liverpool’s win over Nottingham Forest.\n\nDOWNLOAD THE OFFICIAL EMPIRE OF THE KOP APP FOR ALL THE LATEST & BREAKING UPDATES – STRAIGHT TO YOUR PHONE! ON APPLE & GOOGLE PLAY\n\nDespite the head coach saying in the lead-up to the game that Joe Gomez was ‘ready to start’, the defender had to be content with a substitute appearance once more as the Hungarian was instead given the nod on the right-hand side of the back four.\n\nThat experiment was abandoned shortly after the half-hour mark as the 25-year-old swapped positions with Curtis Jones, and the Reds’ number 8 put in the cross which ultimately led to Alexis Mac Allister’s stoppage-time winner.\n\nIn his latest column for the Liverpool Echo, Aldridge called for Slot to dispense with the idea of playing Szoboszlai at right-back and instead keep him in his natural midfield position where his influence can be maximised.\n\nThe former Reds striker wrote: ‘Dominik Szoboszlai is being wasted at right-back at Liverpool, and the time has come for the experiment of using the Hungarian as an emergency answer to the problem position to be stopped once and for all.\n\n‘Only 15 minutes had gone at Nottingham Forest on Sunday when I was shouting at the television for Arne Slot to move Szoboszlai out of the role and back into the engine room. Liverpool were being overrun in midfield and really needed somebody with his physicality and attributes to get stuck in.\n\n(Photo by Lewis Storey/Getty Images)\n\n‘In the end, it took another quarter-of-an-hour before Slot made the change and Liverpool were much better for it, particularly in the second half.\n\n‘Szoboszlai has been our best player this season by some distance and it makes sense to play him where he does the most damage to the opposition and best serves the Reds. He offers something different to the other Liverpool midfielders and has the type of dynamism that, for all their qualities, Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister do not.’\n\nWhile we can understand Slot being cautious with the use of Gomez, who’s not long back from injury and has had some serious absences in his time at Liverpool, it seemed strange not to start him on Sunday if he’d been deemed fit enough to do so.\n\nIn the first half in particular at the City Ground, the Reds badly missed the energy and dynamism that Szoboszlai would’ve brought to their midfield had he been playing there, and it didn’t seem coincidental that they (albeit gradually) got a foothold in the game after the positional switch with Jones.\n\n(Photo by Lewis Storey/Getty Images)\n\nWe get that the Hungarian has been deployed at right-back through necessity given the injury problems we’ve had in that role this season, but he needs to be playing in his strongest position in order to get the most out of his game-changing qualities.\n\nSlot is hopeful of having Jeremie Frimpong cleared to play against West Ham on Saturday, and while the 25-year-old’s frequent fitness issues could see him being handled with care, Gomez should certainly be primed to start at the weekend.\n\nIf Szoboszlai were confined to playing at right-back for the full match against Forest, would he have been in a position to deliver the cross which led to Mac Allister’s winner? Would Liverpool have been completely overrun in midfield to the extent that the game was already lost by that point?\n\nThese hypothetical questions will never have a definitive answer, but what we can say with conviction is that Aldridge is quite right to implore the Reds boss to end the experiement of playing our number 8 in a makeshift role and instead deploy him where we can get the best out of his abilities.",

    "fullText": "Arsenal have responded to a disappointing spell with victory over Tottenham, yet there remains far more at stake this season.\n\nAfter back-to-back draws, it appeared that Mikel Arteta’s side might struggle to carry the title race over the line. Questions were raised about their ability to cope with mounting pressure at the decisive stage of the campaign. However, the win against Spurs has restored belief among supporters and shifted the narrative once again. This fluctuation in confidence reflects the rollercoaster nature of their season, one that is likely to continue until the final whistle of the campaign.\n\nArsenal and Manchester City have established a clear gap over the rest of the field, turning the contest into a two-horse race. Despite Arsenal dropping valuable points in recent weeks, they remain firmly in contention. City possesses greater experience in navigating run-ins of this magnitude, and it is understandable why many consider them favourites to lift the trophy. Nevertheless, Arsenal cannot be discounted.\n\nWith ten league matches remaining, the Gunners aim to replace Liverpool as champions of England. Manchester City, however, are equally determined to prevent that outcome. The margin for error is minimal, and each fixture carries heightened significance.\n\n(Photo by James Fearn/Getty Images)\n\nAlthough Arsenal still face high-profile encounters against Chelsea and Manchester City, their most delicate assignments may come against Brighton and Bournemouth. Recent results against Brentford and Wolves exposed a vulnerability against sides many would expect them to defeat. Addressing that inconsistency will be crucial.\n\nIf Arsenal can demonstrate renewed authority in those fixtures, it will signal genuine progress. Maintaining composure and delivering consistent performances against teams across the table will ultimately determine whether they have learned from earlier setbacks. The coming weeks promise drama, and Arsenal’s response will reveal whether they possess the resilience required to secure the Premier League crown.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo here are some simple rules which I must insist commenters follow….\n\nYou agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans. Everyone is allowed to hold their own opinions even if you disagree with them. It COSTS NOTHING TO BE POLITE TO OTHER ARSENAL FANS.\n\nCALLING ALL ARSENAL FANS!

ON APPLE & GOOGLE PLAY\n\nFollowing his appointment in November 2024, Amorim swiftly realised that Man Utd is a different ball game, so he requested the signings of Premier League-proven players.\n\nBut while Jason Wilcox and Co. were happy to oblige in the cases of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, opinions began to diverge afterwards.\n\nAmorim wished to continue the EPL trend by recruiting the experienced Aston Villa duo of Ollie Watkins and Emiliano Martinez.\n\nHowever, both players ended up staying at Villa Park, while Man Utd went fishing for young profiles on the continent.\n\nSenne Lammens celebrates Patrick Dorgu scoring for Man Utd. (Photo by Carl Recine/Getty Images)\n\nIn the striker role, Man Utd’s Head of Recruitment, Christopher Vivell, had the final say, as he was reunited with Benjamin Sesko, whom he had overseen during his time with the Red Bull orbit.\n\nWhen it came to choosing the new No.1, The Telegraph journalist James Ducker gave the plaudits to United’s goalkeeper scout, Tony Coton, who stood his ground.\n\nAs the source explains, Coton was never convinced of Onana’s signing in 2023, but he perhaps didn’t argue enough to prevent what unfolded as a £47.5 million mistake on the club’s part, a decision he lived to regret.\n\nTherefore, Coton wasn’t going to stand aside and watch United commit what could be another blunder. So instead of giving a nervous nod to Martinez’s arrival, the unwavering scout insisted on signing Lammens, a profile he deemed more suitable for the role, not to mention younger and cheaper.\n\nThis time, Coton had his way, and the Beglian has immediately proved him right. Lammens, who has already gained comparisons with Edwin van der Sar, was ‘outstanding’ against Everton, as Ducker puts it, helping MUFC come away with a 1-0 victory in their first visit to the Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\nLammens has also been lauded for his calm and collected approach that made him an instant favourite at Man Utd.\n\nSo while Amorim was perhaps frustrated with the management, which didn’t always fulfil his desires on the market, the club directors were apparently wise to go their own way, at least on this particular occasion.",

ON APPLE & GOOGLE PLAY\n\nThe Copenhagen native was brilliant in Carrick’s first two games in charge. While playing as a left winger, his goals helped Man Utd beat Manchester City in the Derby, and then league leaders Arsenal the following week.\n\nSadly for Dorgu, a hamstring injury forced him to stop following the win at the Emirates Stadium.\n\nDorgu’s injury was swiftly described as serious, with sources suggesting he could be out for 10 weeks, predicting a return in early April.\n\nHowever, The Athletic journalist Carl Anka has now delivered a worse verdict, as he believes that the player won’t return before mid-April.\n\nIt should also be noted that these long layoffs are always followed by a rehabilitation period, as even when the player is considered medically cleared, he still requires additional time to regain his optimal athletic condition.\n\nTherefore, Dorgu might not regain a prominent role in the team before the final weeks of the campaign.\n\nWhile Carrick had decided to field Dorgu as a left winger instead of Matheus Cunha against City and Arsenal, it remains unclear whether this choice was due to the size of the opposition.\n\nIn any case, Man Utd have enough options in attack at the moment, especially with Mason Mount set for an imminent return, and Shea Lacey knocking on the first team’s door.\n\n(Photo by Ion Alcoba Beitia/Getty Images)\n\nNevertheless, Carrick will be praying that Luke Shaw remains fit until the end of the season. With Dorgu out of action, the Englishman’s most natural replacement is Tyrell Malacia, who has become an afterthought at Carrington.\n\nThe alternative option is to convert either Diogo Dalot or Noussair Mazraoui to the left flank.",

In three of those cases, on-field decisions were changed following VAR intervention, sparking further debate about its influence on the game.\n\nGrant Irvine on VAR at Celtic Park failed to call Matthew MacDermid over to the monitor despite Hibs defender Jack Iredale clearly pulling Liam Scales down in the penalty box.\n\n22.02.2026 Celtic v Hibernian, Scottish Premiership.

It hurts brutally as a striker when you score three goals, and none of them count.”\n\n“You can’t even celebrate anymore. What else can you do? In my view, the referee should remain a referee and make the decisions on the field. He decides what happens on the pitch. If he says it’s a foul, then it’s a foul.”\n\n“These are factual decisions. The referee perceives this better on the pitch than any computer or anyone sitting in Cologne drinking coffee and making decisions for the referees.”\n\n“I find VAR interventions very weak. The referees should start taking matters into their own hands. Nobody can tell me my goal was offside.

    "fullText": "Kendry Paez was once the youngster Chelsea fans were most excited about, but things are not going well for him, and there’s bad injury news today.\n\nThere was a lot of expectation around Kendry Paez when Chelsea agreed to sign him way back in June 2023. The wonderkid had broken into the Independiente del Valle team and was soon picking up Ecuador caps despite his ridiculously young age.\n\nThings haven’t gone as well since then. His form had already tailed off a little before leaving South America this summer, and his loan at Strasbourg was a disaster. He has since returned to his home continent to join River Place, and unfortunately for him things haven’t started well there either.\n\nKendry Paez in action for River Plate. (Photo by Rodrigo Valle/Getty Images)\n\nPaez made his debut as a sub on the 12th of February, and made his second appearance off the bench last weekend. Sadly, it looks like it will be his last for while. After just 25 minutes on the pitch, he picked up a shoulder injury which will apparently keep him out for “two to four weeks.”\n\nIt’s the last thing he needs – another false start. We hope he can get fit, get playing, get his head right, and start fulfilling some of his huge potential. This loan can potentially be a good one, but only if he’s able to play regularly.\n\nThe race for the top 5 is going to be so tight now, and Gary Lineker’s take on the final lineup is rather interesting for Chelsea fans…\n\nIn his post match interview, Trevoh Chalobah pointed to another one of this team’s big flaws – their inability to score their chances and put games away.\n\nCheck out the latest edition of Simon Phillips’ SPTC podcast here:",

    "fullText": "League leaders Coventry City face play-off hopefuls Sheffield United at Bramall Lane on Wednesday evening.\n\nThe Blades enter this contest after defeating Steel City rivals Sheffield Wednesday on Sunday afternoon which ultimately relegated the Owls. Whilst it’s always great to get the win over your bitter rivals, United’s main focus is on their race for the play-offs, in which they are six points behind sixth place Wrexham.\n\nCoventry head to South Yorkshire in form having won their previous two games with the most recent one coming against West Bromwich Albion in a 2-0 away win last weekend. The Sky Blues are currently three points ahead of second place Middlesbrough.\n\nThe Blades continue to be without Tom Davies and Sam McCallum, while defensive midfielder could come back into the matchday squad following the red card of Kalvin Phillips who now serves a three-match suspension.\n\nFrank Lampard’s side aren’t dealing with any major injury news for their trip to Bramall Lane, though they are still managing versatile forward Brandon Thomas-Asante’s minutes after returning to action recently.\n\nSHEFFIELD, ENGLAND – FEBRUARY 22: Gustavo Hamer of Sheffield United clashes with Gabriel Otegbayo of Sheffield Wednesday during the Sky Bet Championship match between Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday at Bramall Lane on February 22, 2026 in Sheffield, England. (Photo by Cameron Smith/Getty Images)\n\nCoventry City’s former star player Gustavo Hamer has not featured as much as he would’ve liked for the Blades this season. Yet, he has still managed to rack up two goals and nine assists in 18 Championship starts, which is a prime example of his contribution to the team. Six of those assists have all come in the last games, pointing to an upturn in form right when the business end of the season has creeped up on us.\n\nHamer is averaging over two shots and over two chances created per game, performing excellently in both stat lines compared to his positional peers in the Championship. United will hope he continues his fine run of form against his former side on Wednesday night.\n\nWhile Coventry are top of the league they have been giving their opponents opportunities in recent weeks, so they aren’t exactly water tight at the back. One area where the Blades can capitalise is in set-piece situations.\n\nTen of Coventry’s 36 goals conceded have come via set-pieces, and with Hamer’s ability to whip in pacey crosses from wide free-kicks and corners, and his ability to shoot from any range and angle, perhaps the Dutchman can produce something from these moments on Wednesday evening. And if you remember back to last season’s fixture at Bramall Lane, Hamer delivered a simply outrageous free-kick goal from about 30-yards out in front of the away end on a cold Friday night in a 3-1 victory.\n\nHaji Wright has been one of the standout strikers in the second division over the past few years, and the American has already exceeded his tally of 12 goals last term, now currently sitting on 13, and you’d bank on him getting to 20 by the end of the season.\n\nThe American possesses length, pace and power, which is a hard combination to stop. But he has the predatory instincts and composure in front of goal to score any type of goal, with both feet and in the air.\n\nWright has scored 41 goals in the last three Championship campaigns, and this is despite missing half of last term with an injury. The 27-year-old is averaging over 3.50 shots per game so he will no doubt test Michael Cooper’s shot-stopping ability at Bramall Lane.\n\nMeanwhile, Japhet Tanganga and Tyler Bindon will have their work cut out. Wright could look to isolate Bindon, who is the slower of the two centre-backs, so Tanganga will have to be on his toes to help cover any threat in behind them. Plus, the Coventry man has a 41% total duel success rate, which is a good rate for a Championship striker.\n\nThis has the making of being one of the best Championship matches of the season because of what rides on this kick-off. The Blades are trying to punch their way into the play-offs late on in this campaign, while the Sky Blues, who looked unstoppable for most of the season early on, are now trying to see out the job.\n\nSheffield United have won five of their last six home games, and four of those have seen the Blades score three goals. Interestingly, the previous two home games against Coventry City have ended in 3-1 victories for United. I think this score will be registered once again on Wednesday.",

He’s standing full-backs up. He’s taking them on and then clipping it [to the] back post, making the right decisions. He’s still gonna make mistakes, but how can he not be starting a few more games?\n\n“If your wingers who are playing aren’t performing, then he’s got a right to sit there and ask for a little cameo and go, ‘Let me start a game, at least’. He looks electrifying and I saw this kid when he was 12, 13 years old. He is a special talent.”\n\n(Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\nFerdinand also named the Liverpool starlet among a quartet of teenagers who could become household names in England’s top flight over the next few years.\n\nHe declared: “Right now, if I was going to put money on and going ‘these four’ – and you know what, it probably won’t even be these four that go and dominate the Premier League and do crazy things – if you were going to put your money on four kids right now, in the Premier League to do their thing, based on what you’re seeing now, you’ve got Rio at Liverpool, Max Dowman [Arsenal], JJ Gabriel at Man United, and Jesse Derry at Chelsea.”\n\nDaniel Sturridge and Lewis Steele have both called for Slot to reward Ngumoha with more frequent game-time off the back of his latest performance, while Jamie Carragher said on Sky Sports that the 17-year-old ‘changed the game’ after he came on at the City Ground on Sunday.\n\nUp to now, the Liverpool head coach has proceeded with caution in terms of the teenager’s exposure to the first team, which is understandable considering his youth and the unforgiving scrutiny which comes with playing at an elite level.\n\nWe’ve also seen with numerous prodigious talents in the past that there’s a danger in overhyping them after only a handful of senior appearances and then seeing them struggle to live up to stratospheric expectations placed on them externally.\n\n(Photo by Jan Kruger/Getty Images)\n\nFrom everything that we’ve seen of Ngumoha so far, though, he appears to be taking all of that in his stride and playing in crucial first-team fixtures with a refreshing freedom and self-confidence, as can be seen in his propensity to take on (and often beat) much more established opponents.\n\nIn addition to his captivating dribbling skills, the teenager is also capable of producing sublime finishes, such as the ‘goal’ against Brighton in the FA Cup that he was wrongly denied because of an erroneous offside call (and the absence of VAR to potentially overturn the decision).\n\nWe’d be wary of making any grandiose predictions about his career for now, but we’d certainly approve if he were to be handed a first Premier League start when Liverpool host West Ham next Saturday.\n\nIt’s a pleasure to watch him in action, and for the time being we simply want to enjoy seeing what he can produce and what levels he might be capable of reaching in future years.",

    "fullText": "Alessio Tacchinardi has expressed concern that Luciano Spalletti may begin to lose faith in his Juventus players, warning that such a shift could prove damaging at a crucial stage of the season.\n\nWhen Spalletti arrived in Turin last year, he was confident he could achieve success with the squad at his disposal. Juventus possess some of the finest and most expensive players in Serie A, and the Bianconeri believed they required a manager capable of maximising that talent. In Spalletti, they appeared to have found the right solution.\n\nFor much of his tenure, Spalletti has overseen encouraging progress. Juventus enjoyed an impressive run of form in recent months, suggesting that stability and belief had been restored. However, momentum has stalled. Their defeat to Como at the weekend extended a worrying sequence, with the team now winless in their last five matches and having lost four of those fixtures.\n\nIt is a troubling downturn for a side aiming to finish the campaign strongly. With expectations of a deep run in the Champions League appearing limited, securing a top-four finish in Serie A remains their primary objective. Sustained inconsistency at this stage places that ambition at risk.\n\nLuciano Spalletti (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nTacchinardi has urged Spalletti not to waver in his public backing of the squad. As reported by Tuttojuve, he said:\n\n“It seemed like Spalletti had given this team consistency, but then there was a reversal, many steps backwards, and the things Spalletti is saying now, if this is our level and there’s cause for concern, then I hope he doesn’t start losing faith in his players, who he’s always said are the best of all and are doing great things. Therefore, because it’s a team that doesn’t have great charisma, great personality, if they also lose the confidence of their coach, they could really struggle between now and the end of the season.”\n\nTacchinardi’s comments underline the importance of unity and belief if Juventus are to arrest their decline and secure their seasonal targets.",

ON APPLE & GOOGLE PLAY\n\nAlthough the Egyptian’s current contract runs to June 2027, there’s been continuing discourse about his short-term future, with both Richard Keys and Tim Sherwood claiming in recent days that the 33-year-old will depart Anfield in the coming summer.\n\nThe Reds have been constantly linked with prospective long-term replacements for our number 11 over the past few months, with RB Leipzig youngster Yan Diomande among the most-cited targets for a prospective move to Merseyside.\n\n(Photo by Alex Livesey/Getty Images)\n\nHeskey has said that the task of replacing Salah at Liverpool is virtually impossible, but he’s pinpointed Kvaratskhelia as his preferrred option to ultimately step into the Egyptian’s vast shoes.\n\nThe former Reds striker told OLBG (via The Mirror): “We’re talking about replacing Mohamed Salah and I think as fans you’ve got to look at something different because you can’t replace Mo Salah.\n\n“I remember one season I was speaking to someone who said Mo’s had a bad season. He’d scored 25 goals! I’d love to have had that bad of a season. We’re talking about someone scoring 20 plus, nearly 30 goals a season for 10 years.\n\n“I don’t think you can replace Mo Salah but I do like the lad from PSG, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. He would be my go-to.”\n\n(Photo by Franco Arland/Getty Images)\n\nJust over a year after joining PSG from Napoli in an €80m (£70m) deal, the Georgia international has accrued 16 goals and 14 assists in 63 appearances – a decent if not earth-shattering return.\n\nAccording to Gianluca Di Marzio, Liverpool had actually made an offer of €100m (£87.4m) for the 25-year-old in Arne Slot’s first summer in charge, but the Serie A club rejected the proposal before selling him to Luis Enrique’s side a few months later.\n\nThat twist of fate came back to haunt the Reds as Kvaratskhelia was in the PSG side which knocked us out of the Champions League on their way to winning the competition, with the winger scoring one of their five goals in the final against Inter Milan.\n\nThe Georgian hasn’t been a guaranteed starter at the Parc des Princes this season (just 11 in Ligue 1 so far), but similar to Diomande, his ability to play on either flank could make him a quite appealing option for the Anfield hierarchy.\n\nHe’s also coming into what’ll likely be his prime footballing years and already boasts a wealth of high-level experience for both club and country, so he could be a top-tier successor to Salah in the Liverpool side if the Reds were to move for him in the near future.\n\nHeskey’s recommendation seems to be a sound one, although it’d surely take a lofty transfer fee to persuade PSG to sell Kvaratskhelia unless circumstances were to change drastically.",

ON APPLE & GOOGLE PLAY\n\nWith just over four months remaining on his current contract, Andy Robertson is approaching the end of his nine-year spell at Anfield as things stand, and Tottenham Hotspur had been working on a potential swoop for him in January before LFC blocked any prospective exit.\n\nThe 31-year-old indicated last month that while his preference would be to remain on Merseyside, he isn’t content to merely accept a bit-part role, having made just five Premier League starts all season as Milos Kerkez has generally been preferred at left-back.\n\nAccording to a fresh report from CaughtOffside, Liverpool aren’t actively pushing the Scotland captain towards a summer exit but are apparently ‘open to reasonable offers’ for the defender if it’d ensure him regular first-team football elswhere.\n\nThe Premier League trio of Wolves, Crystal Palace and Aston Villa have all been credited with ‘monitoring developments’ regarding Robertson, who’s also understood to be admired by Atletico Madrid for his ‘defensive grit and competitive mentality’.\n\nThe left-back’s future at Anfield is said to be ‘entering a delicate and defining phase’, with a decision looming as to whether he pens a contract extension or departs at the end of this season.\n\n(Photo by Dan Istitene/Getty Images)\n\nOne thing we can most definitely say about Robertson is that he’s earned the right to leave Liverpool on his own terms, considering everything he’s given to the club since joining from Hull in 2017.\n\nHis name will be synonymous with the Jurgen Klopp era at Anfield, having been a near-constant starter during the German’s reign, and he’s been a core presence throughout several major trophy wins, including two Premier League titles, the Champions League and a smattering of domestic cups.\n\nHe sits 38th in the Reds’ all-time appearances list with 367 (lfchistory.net) and, despite losing his place to Kerkez in the starting XI, the vice-captain continues to be a crucial figure in Slot’s squad for his leadership qualities and for what he offers on the pitch when selected.\n\nWith Wolves almost certain to be relegated, it’s hard to see Robertson dropping down to the Championship at this stage in his career. He could get opportunities at Villa seeing as their squad isn’t enormous and they’ll likely be in Europe again next term, but Liverpool may not be overly enamoured with seeing him join a positional rival.\n\nThe hope is that the 31-year-old can be persuaded to at least bring up a full decade at Anfield and remain for another couple of seasons, but it’s also understandable that he mightn’t be content to keep playing second fiddle to the Hungarian left-back.\n\nEither way, with just four months left on his contract, a major decision is looming ever larger.",

Moreover, the Parisians haven’t been shy about pursuing young Portuguese players.\n\nVitinha, João Neves, and Gonçalo Ramos are among the young talents PSG brought in from Portugal. Nonetheless, could the capital club pursue another promising player who is eligible to play for that country at the senior level?\n\nThis past January transfer window, PSG didn’t hesitate to pursue former Barcelona youngster Dro Fernandez. The reigning Champions League winners saw an opening, and they took it.\n\nAs a result, could history repeat itself when the summer transfer window opens in a couple of months?\n\n(Photo by Ben Roberts Photo/Getty Images)\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers look to be on their way to being relegated from the Premier League after this season. Now, Fichajes reports that Mateus Mané is one of their young players and has caught the eye of PSG, which is why their relegation could lead to a potential transfer.\n\nMoreover, the report mentions that the transfer fee under discussion is believed to fall between €50 million and €60 million. Mané is under contract until June 2029, but his current club’s need for revenue could accelerate his move to the Parc des Princes.\n\nStill, PSG aren’t the only club keen on the player, as the Spanish outlet reports that Liverpool are also a team with its eyes on the versatile player, who can play as an attacking midfielder or center-forward.\n\nIn 17 Premier League appearances, the 18-year-old has recorded four goal contributions (two goals and two assists).",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nA year ago at this time, Devin Williams was lined up to be a dominant relief ace for the New York Yankees.\n\nInstead, he encountered a season of struggles, and while he turned it around a bit by the end, he wasn't close to the dominant pitcher he had been with the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\n\"Williams endured a tumultuous year in the Bronx,\" MLB.com's Thomas Harrigan wrote on Tuesday. \"The righty lost his grip on the closer role and ended up with a 4.79 ERA -- well north of the sparkling 1.83 figure he had over six years with Milwaukee.\"\n\nWhen Williams' contract was up at the end of the season, the Yanks let him walk. The New York Mets hopped in to sign him as part of their replacement plan for the departed closer Edwin Diaz.\n\n\"Williams’ underlying metrics -- including a 37.7% whiff rate, a 34.7% strikeout rate and a 2.68 FIP -- paint his season in a much more optimistic light and help explain why the Mets were comfortable signing him to a three-year, $51 million deal to be their new closer,\" Harrigan wrote.\n\nMORE: Yankees making history not done since 1889 Chicago White Stockings\n\nThose numbers are why Harrigan has listed Williams as one of his 10 biggest bounceback candidates in baseball for the season ahead.\n\nCertainly, Mets fans would love it if Williams was a dominant closer, while it'd have to be frustrating for Yankees fans.\n\n\"Williams hasn’t moved far geographically, going from the Bronx to Queens, but he’s projected to make a quantum leap on the mound,\" Harrigan writes. \"He ranks 11th or better among relievers in projected ERA (3.12, tied for 11th), K/9 (11.93, ninth), WAR (1.3, tied for 10th) and saves (32, tied for third).\"\n\nThe Mets definitely need a showing like that from Williams. Their fanbase likely isn't thrilled that they let Diaz leave for the powerful Dodgers, and so at least finding an able replacement will go a long way toward making things feel OK.\n\nTeam USA has a finalized WBC roster and an awesome lineup\n\nDominican Republic WBC roster is loaded with stars\n\nAn Edwin Diaz nightmare looms for the Mets\n\nBuster Posey will change Hall of Fame voting forever\n\nHow Jose Ramirez is on pace to become Cleveland's Derek Jeter\n\nYankees have signed a catcher from the country of Hungary",

This week, police forces across the country will be investigating six separate incidents of online racial abuse following games in England and Scotland alone. Two of those incidents came from Burnley's clash with Chelsea, with both Hannibal Mejbri and Wesley Fofana being targeted.\n\nLet me say this loud and clear for those at the back: discrimination in any form is wrong; behaviour which seeks to intimidate, offend or harm an individual based on their perceived race, colour, ethnicity, nationality or national origins is wrong; posting your hate behind anonymous and faceless social media profiles does not make you immune from consequences.\n\nWe have to do more as a society to eliminate this behaviour once and for all. As the saying goes, to fight racism, we have to be proactively anti-racist.\n\nFor all the pressure that Scott Parker and his team are under, they have quietly delivered two very impressive back to back results; firstly, coming back from 2-0 down to win 2-3 at Crystal Palace, before levelling against Chelsea deep into stoppage time on Saturday afternoon.\n\nLet's get the negatives out of the way first; in both games the Clarets conceded very early goals and that is something Parker has to get under control. There is little point persisting with a system of five at the back if you are going to invite so much pressure onto your back line. Never mind the immediate impact it has on your game plan.\n\nBut irrespective of that, Burnley delivered something that has been lacking for a while – grit and determination. The Clarets may well have left it too late to have any meaningful impact on this season, but it would help build some bridges with the fans if they go down with a fight.\n\nFind more from Natalie Bromley at No Nay Never podcast",

    "fullText": "Former Everton striker Jermaine Beckford has been speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast about whether he agrees with David Moyes that Manchester United goalkeeper Senne Lammens was the difference in Monday's defeat at Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\n\"I absolutely do, especially towards the back end of the game,\" Beckford said.\n\n\"Everton were piling on pressure in terms of set-pieces being put in. They put eight or nine players around the keeper, made it really difficult for him to collect anything but he was fantastic. They threw everything and the kitchen sink at the guy and he was immense. The difference.\n\n\"As a striker, my frustration from Everton's perspective is the lack of movement and direct running in the final third. It is frustrating, it really is. You can hear it in Moyes' voice. The team played really well, they gave Manchester United a tough game. But at the end of the day if you can't put away chances, you're not going to be able to score goals.\n\n\"I thought the boys in midfield, Tim Iroegbunam and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall were brilliant. But then creativity wise, Ndiaye did as well as he could do. He was probably the best player on the pitch in terms of every time he got the ball he was direct and positive. But there was nobody else to really unlock the United defence.\n\n\"Tyrique George was a bit of a throwback to the old school where as a winger you give him the ball and say, 'go on then, attack your full-back. Let's see what you can do'. He got the crowd up and bubbling. But this is a youngster, we need a little more of that from one or two of the experienced players.\n\n\"It's an area to look at improving in the summer. But when you look at where Everton have been in previous seasons and where they are now, we have to take it with a bit of context. Everton are still in a great position - ninth and touching distance of a European spot. You have a target in mind.\"\n\nListen to Beckford from 1:20:00 here",

    "fullText": "Pitching remains the backbone of championship baseball, and every season brings a reshuffling of which clubs truly control the mound. In its latest evaluation of starting staffs entering the 2026 season, CBS Sports ranked Major League Baseball’s most formidable rotations based on talent, depth, health outlook, and overall upside. The result is a revealing snapshot of where pitching power is concentrated across the league — and where volatility still lurks beneath the surface.\n\nSome rotations earn their place through proven dominance, built around Cy Young–caliber aces and established postseason performers. Others rise because of emerging stars, improved depth, or high-ceiling arms that could dramatically outperform expectations. What makes this ranking especially compelling is how it blends stability with uncertainty. Several teams near the top have overwhelming talent but still carry durability concerns, while a few lower-ranked staffs could climb quickly if young pitchers take another step forward.\n\nThe list also reflects broader trends shaping modern roster construction. Organizations increasingly prioritize layered pitching depth rather than relying on just one superstar. Development pipelines, injury recovery timelines, and workload management strategies now influence rankings almost as much as raw performance. In many cases, a rotation’s long-term outlook matters just as much as its immediate projection.\n\nUltimately, these rankings don’t just measure pitching quality — they reveal which teams are best positioned to control games from the first inning onward. And in a sport where dominant starting pitching can redefine an entire season, that advantage can be decisive.\n\nNew York’s rotation is packed with recognizable names but loaded with uncertainty. Injuries, recovery timelines, and workload concerns make long-term reliability difficult to project. When everything aligns, the talent level is unquestionably elite. The challenge is keeping that version of the staff intact over a full season.\n\nToronto’s rotation has legitimate top-of-the-rotation firepower and strong supporting depth. Their upside is enormous when multiple starters are locked in at once. The issue has been sustaining peak performance over time. Consistency will determine whether they rise or remain stuck in the middle tier.\n\nPittsburgh’s staff is fueled by youth, electric stuff, and growing confidence. The ceiling is extremely high thanks to emerging frontline talent. Development remains the key variable, but the progress is undeniable. This is a rotation transitioning from promising to legitimately dangerous.\n\nCincinnati’s rotation reflects steady organizational growth. Young arms are beginning to translate raw ability into dependable production. Momentum is building across the entire group, not just individual pitchers. If that trend continues, they could climb quickly.\n\nPhiladelphia brings elite upside but also significant health and performance questions. Key contributors returning from injury or decline shape the staff’s overall outlook. At their best, they can rival almost any rotation in baseball. Their ranking hinges on how much of that ceiling actually appears.\n\nSeattle succeeds through structure, depth, and environment. Their rotation may not rely on one dominant ace, but the collective effectiveness is relentless. They consistently suppress scoring and carry heavy workloads. It’s a system that wins through sustained pressure rather than bursts.\n\nThe Rangers represent one of the most volatile but fascinating rotations in the league. Several starters possess ace-level talent, yet durability questions remain. If enough pitchers stay healthy and perform to expectations, they could surge dramatically. Few rotations have a wider range of possible outcomes.\n\nDetroit combines top-tier star power with meaningful reinforcements around its ace. Their rotation blends proven dominance with experienced support and veteran presence. When fully aligned, it’s one of the most intimidating staffs in baseball. Opponents face very few comfortable matchups.\n\nBoston’s rotation stands out for both quality and structural balance. They feature frontline excellence without sharp drop-offs deeper into the staff. Reliability and depth make them dangerous over long stretches. This is a rotation designed for sustained contention.\n\nThe Dodgers set the standard with overwhelming star power and elite depth. Multiple pitchers can perform at ace level, giving them unmatched flexibility. Even injuries rarely derail them thanks to organizational depth. This is a rotation built to dominate both the regular season and October.\n\nCBS Sports’ 2026 rotation rankings highlight just how decisive starting pitching remains in shaping the competitive landscape of Major League Baseball. From the Dodgers’ overwhelming dominance to the rising potential of younger staffs like Cincinnati and Pittsburgh, the list reflects a league defined by both established excellence and rapid evolution. Depth, durability, and development pipelines now matter as much as pure star power, and several teams sit just one breakout season away from reshaping the hierarchy. As the season unfolds, these rankings will inevitably shift — but they offer a clear starting point for understanding where pitching strength currently resides. In a game where control of the mound often determines everything else, these rotations represent the teams most equipped to dictate how 2026 baseball will be played.\n\nOLYMPICS: Final 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings\n\nNFL: 4 blockbuster NFL trades we want to see before the 2026 draft\n\nNFL DRAFT: 2026 NFL Scouting Combine day-to-day TV schedule, how to watch\n\nMLB: MLB Power Rankings as 2026 Spring Training begins\n\nNBA: Updated NBA Power Rankings as a new week begins\n\nVIRAL: Watch Johnny Gaudreau’s children join Team USA hockey gold medal celebration\n\nThe post MLB latest power rankings by CBS Sports appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United are increasingly at risk of missing out on Said El Mala as Brighton & Hove Albion plot a unique tactic to secure the German starlet’s signature, according to a new report.\n\nThe Red Devils are targeting a new left-winger this summer, given the lack of natural options in comparison to the well-stocked right-hand side.\n\nLast night, caretaker coach Michael Carrick secured his fifth win from six games since taking the reins at Old Trafford in the wake of Ruben Amorim’s explosive departure in January. However, it was a hard-fought 1-0 victory over a stubborn Everton side, with a dearth of attacking quality from both sides at the Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\nIt was the type of game that exposed United’s inability to maintain width down the left, as Matheus Cunha prefers to cut inside, while Luke Shaw lacks the physicality to offer a consistent overlap from full-back. The Brazil international produced a brilliant pass late in the match to set free Bryan Mbeumo down the right, who then fed the rampaging Benjamin Sesko to finish with aplomb past Jordan Pickford and secure all three points.\n\nBut the squad would feel far more balanced with a pure left-winger to offer an alternative to Cunha, with Patrick Dorgu – currently ruled out with a hamstring injury – dropping back to left-back to provide the attacking thrust Shaw is incapable of delivering.\n\nOne of the club’s primary targets, Iliman Ndiaye, was in fine form for the Toffees, causing United’s defence problems in the second half with his dizzying dribbling and two-footedness. Another key option is RB Leipzig speedster Yan Diomande, whose breakout season in Germany has put the Ivorian winger in the crosshairs of every major club in Europe.\n\nThe Red Bull club are understood to be asking for up to €100m for their 19-year-old starlet, however, making a deal difficult. Everton will also demand a huge fee for Ndiaye, comparable to the one paid for Mbeumo last summer, with United expected to prioritise a revamp in central midfield instead.\n\nThis has led to cheaper alternatives being considered on the left wing – with FC Köln’s sensation El Mala emerging as a player with many admirers at Old Trafford. However, the 19-year-old winger, who has an outside shot at making Germany’s squad for the World Cup this summer, is also being closely tracked by Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nBut it is Brighton who are said to be leading the race for El Mala, as they plot a unique tactic to fend off their Premier League rivals to sign the youngster this summer.\n\nThe Times reveals the Seagulls tabled a £22m bid in January, having already made an approach to sign El Mala last summer while he was on loan in the German third division.\n\nThe winger’s rapid rise this season has only strengthened the south coast side’s desire to secure a deal. He has returned eight goals and four assists from 23 appearances in the Bundesliga, though only 10 of these have been starts.\n\nEl Mala is averaging a goal contribution every 94 minutes on the pitch and has become the “focal point” of Köln’s attack. He stands nearly 6’2, possessing a potent pairing of speed and size for a flying winger with an excellent technical base.\n\nIt is little wonder clubs in England are on the Germany U-21 international’s tails, given how well his profile as an attacker translates in theory to the Premier League.\n\nBrighton have even gone as far as expressing interest in El Mala’s brother, Malek, who plays for Köln’s reserves in the fourth division, as a means of convincing the 19-year-old winger to move to the Amex. A double raid for two brothers is a novel way to convince the more talented one to join your team, though there is precedent for it, even at Europe’s biggest clubs.\n\nEl Mala is an outstanding prospect who offers an excellent blend of physical and technical attributes. His ability to already be decisive in the opposition box, despite limited opportunities and only turning 19 this season, is a hugely promising sign for the future.\n\nHowever, if his signature requires the signing of a fourth-division prospect from Germany at the same time, United would be advised to look elsewhere this summer, rather than pander to a request which is likely to only spell trouble later on.\n\nFeature image Alexander Hassenstein via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "David Coulthard has suggested that Sergio Perez’s break from Formula 1 could leave him playing catch-up to Valtteri Bottas at Cadillac this season.\n\nCadillac went into testing under the microscope, with plenty of questions about what they’d managed to put together since being given less than a year to build an F1 car.\n\nTeam principal Graeme Lowdon moved quickly to steady the ship, bringing in two experienced drivers in Bottas and Perez for their first campaign.\n\nWhile Bottas spent his time away from the grid serving as Mercedes’ reserve driver, Perez stepped back from racing altogether following a difficult final stretch with Red Bull.\n\nCoulthard discussed Formula 1’s newest team on the Stay on Track Podcast, saying: “I don’t think there’s anything wrong with the two drivers they’ve got there.\n\n“It’s not the fastest driver pairing in Formula 1 as established by their career so far. But safe pair of hands, they don’t need to be breaking cars with rookies, you know? They need to be just getting up to speed with the operation of the team and the new regulations and things like that.\n\n“So I actually think they’ve made a smart choice. I think Bottas is better prepared because he’s coming with that Mercedes information. He’s been working with Mercedes all last year, simulator work and the like.\n\n“I’m a little bit concerned for Perez, who’s really enjoyed the siesta of a year off. I don’t doubt his commitment, but can you switch it back on when you’ve switched it off?\n\n“They’re old enough to be professional out of the car. They know they’ve got to work for the greater good of the team.\n\n“But make no bones about it. They’re individual teams, managers, physios, and everybody who works around them. Your teammate’s success is your failure.\n\n“You’ve got to beat your teammate. And I’ve got to think if we were laying it out now, I think Bottas has a better chance of beating Perez just by the fact he’s more recent.”\n\nCadillac entered pre-season with realistic goals, focusing on reliability and mileage rather than outright speed. The team completed a full shakedown program in Barcelona, something Aston Martin and Williams couldn’t manage at the time.\n\nBut they still faced some early issues in Bahrain, ending up with one of the lowest total distances covered during testing, only Aston Martin logged fewer laps.\n\nThe split livery has drawn some negative attention online, but that’s likely a low priority for the team right now. On track, Perez was over three seconds off Charles Leclerc’s pace and slightly behind Bottas.\n\nPerez remained upbeat in his post-test comments: “I’ve really enjoyed this pre-season testing period. The atmosphere in the team feels great, we are going in the right direction, we’ve got a good, balanced car and covered a lot of mileage.\n\n“Every lap we are learning more, and now it’s about developing and putting performance on.”\n\n“There’s always more to do, but I’m happy going into this short gap to Melbourne and excited to get back out on track in race mode.”\n\nCarlos Sainz says he’s facing the same challenges as Fernando Alonso in 2026\n\nOscar Piastri says 2026 F1 race starts are ‘trickier in every respect’ after Bahrain testing\n\nJuan Pablo Montoya urges Max Verstappen to act like a champion following 2026 F1 rule criticism",

    "fullText": "There are games that aren’t played with your feet alone, but with your memory.\n\nFor Paulo Dybala, the one against Juventus is one of them. Since wearing the Roma jersey, he’s faced them five times without ever managing to score.\n\nThis is a stinging statistic, especially given that the club on the other side decided not to invest in him in 2022. The moment, moreover, is not the easiest.\n\nKnee pain has kept him sidelined for the last four league games.\n\nAfter several medical consultations, the decision was clear: continue with conservative treatment and targeted work to get him back on his feet as quickly as possible.\n\nThe goal is to have him available for Sunday night’s Champions League clash, a game that could be incredibly important.\n\nThere’s little certainty about Dybala today. But his feelings have changed compared to a few days ago. Dybala is feeling much better; he worked both Sunday and yesterday with personalized training sessions at Trigoria, and the responses have been encouraging. The discomfort has eased, his confidence is growing, and even the medical staff is cautiously optimistic.\n\nThis is why the chances of him at least being included in the squad against Juventus are significantly increasing. It wouldn’t just be a technical recovery, but also an emotional one.\n\nFor Roma, it would mean welcoming back their talent at the most delicate moment; for Dybala, however, it would be the chance to return to prominence against Juventus. And certain stories in football are just waiting for the right moment to be rewritten.",

    "fullText": "The Hungarian had been filling in once again at right-back as the Anfield side’s difficulties in that position show no signing of slowing down.\n\nFor Jones it goes down as a missed opportunity to stake a claim in Slot’s XI - with Wirtz due to return to the side for next weekend’s fixture against West Ham.\n\n“It was about having more control over their midfield,” Slot said to Sky Sports of changing Szoboszlai and Jones around.\n\n“I just highlighted how well they played. We lost every ball. We could not keep the ball for one second. If we went long, we lost the duel. We lost a lot of second balls.\n\n“The only part of the game that went well was defending inside the box. I saw players throwing themselves for long balls, had to defend set pieces. That’s what we did well and stayed in the game.\n\n“The second half I saw something slightly different. We took over the game.”\n\nJones won only three of his 10 duels - and didn’t win the only tackle he attempted in the game either - emphasising Liverpool’s struggles in midfield. We are approaching a very serious crossroads for the England international.\n\nHe is out of contract in 2027 and right now no new deal appears to be on the horizon. The last time he renewed his contract was back in 2022 - when he was a squad player under Jurgen Klopp.\n\nJones will obviously be eyeing a pay rise - but given his peripheral role under Slot in recent weeks it remains to be seen whether Richard Hughes decides to give it to him.\n\nRight now there is a very real possibility that the Merseysiders take the opportunity to cash in on their homegrown talent at the end of the season - with both Tottenham and Inter on his case.",

    "description": "MotoGP’s rider market starts moving long before decisions become public. And Valentino Rossi's VR46 team is looking to the future.",
    "fullText": "MotoGP rarely changes direction in public. It usually happens in small comments that don’t look important until you line them up later. Valentino Rossi’s recent remarks about the 2027 rider market felt like one of those.\n\nIf you’ve been living under a rock, the former MotoGP champion said he already knows which riders he wants for VR46 after 2026. But he wouldn’t name them. That wasn’t coyness. It was a way of forcing Ducati's factory team to react without turning it into a negotiation headline.\n\nAnd the timing matters. In everything, of course. The new regulations arrive in 2027, and when technical advantages shrink, rider choice starts deciding races again. Satellite teams stop being background teams. They become potential contenders if they have the right people on the bike. Rossi clearly wants one of those riders before the reset.\n\nPedro Acosta is the name many could land on first…whether anyone confirms it or not. Ducati would also have to consider how Acosta fits alongside Marc Márquez and what that means for Bagnaia. Once you pull that thread, half the grid moves with it. If Acosta doesn’t land there, attention shifts to younger prospects already orbiting Ducati like Fermín Aldeguer or David Alonso—riders who wouldn’t just fill a seat but define a project.\n\nDucati hasn’t said much. It rarely does at this stage. The manufacturer still controls the timeline—lock in Márquez, understand Bagnaia, then worry about satellites. From Bologna’s perspective, patience is rational. From Rossi’s side, patience risks entering a new ruleset without influence. So the comment wasn’t really about a contract. It was about position.\n\nVR46 can leave after 2026. Under the next regulations, what matters more than it used to, because equalized performance shifts power toward rider placement and team structure instead of factory hardware advantage. Rossi isn’t asking only for machinery. He’s asking where his team sits in Ducati’s order once the bikes matter less. That’s why he said it now and not a year from now.\n\nIf Ducati gives VR46 priority access to a top rider, the relationship effectively becomes a second factory team, whether anyone calls it that or not. If it doesn’t, Rossi suddenly has a reason to listen to other manufacturers at exactly the moment the competitive balance resets.\n\nAnd once one rider moves, the rest follow. A Ducati reshuffle pushes Bagnaia somewhere, which pressures Yamaha’s plans, which affects KTM’s long game, and inevitably pulls Honda into the conversation again. Rider markets in MotoGP are never individual decisions. They’re chain reactions disguised as contracts.\n\nIf you spend enough seasons around this sport, you stop hearing rider comments as quotes and start hearing them as timing. Nobody serious negotiates in public, but they do set the stage there. A sentence lands, another team answers without answering, and a few months later, everyone pretends the outcome was obvious. What Rossi said fits that pattern. Not dramatic, not hostile, just deliberate enough that people understood the message without him needing to spell it out.\n\nRossi didn’t threaten anything. He didn’t need to. He just made it clear that his team intends to matter in the next era, and that decision won’t wait for Ducati’s convenience. Most people in the paddock already understood the message.\n\nMotoGP Fans Furious Over Shock Adelaide Street Circuit Calendar Addition\n\nIt's Time for Jorge Martin to Retire From MotoGP",

    "description": "England sit fourth in the Six Nations table after consecutive defeats by Scotland and Ireland",
    "fullText": "Eddie Jones has attributed England’s recent dramatic collapse in the Guinness Six Nations to what he perceives as Steve Borthwick’s premature focus on a potential title decider against France, even before the tournament had commenced.\n\nSuccessive and emphatic defeats to Scotland and Ireland have swiftly unravelled the progress made during a previous 12-Test winning streak, transforming the upcoming round-four fixture against Italy in Rome on 7 March into a critical must-win encounter.\n\nThis scenario starkly contrasts with the vision Borthwick outlined when announcing his Six Nations squad last month.\n\n\"On March 14 in Paris, we want to be in a position entering that game where we can achieve what we’re all aiming to achieve,\" the head coach stated on 23 January.\n\n\"We want England fans flooding across the Channel to Paris to watch the team in a massive encounter in the final round with the opportunity to achieve what we want.\"\n\nJones, who served as England boss from 2016-2022 before Borthwick’s tenure, has questioned whether the Rugby Football Union (RFU) might have influenced these remarks.\n\n\"I’ll go back to the start of the Six Nations. I thought Steve made some very uncharacteristic comments about a title-decider against France, looking ahead,\" Jones told the Rugby Unity podcast.\n\n\"Steve is the most pragmatic and intelligent coach you could meet, but to look ahead for any team is fraught with danger. We all know that.\"\n\nHe suggested external pressure could have played a role: \"But sometimes the pressure comes so that the union, the RFU, wants to hear more. They want to entice the fans because they’re all hungry for money so they want fans support. So be bold, come out – someone has told him to do that.\"\n\nJones believes such comments can inadvertently distract players. \"\n\nThe players read everything, the wives read everything, the girlfriends read everything, the boyfriends read everything, they all read it,\" he explained.\n\n\"They hear that and they talk to them and they say, ‘We’ve got to get our tickets for France. Where are we staying? Where are we going to go the night before for dinner?’ All of that happens and the slight psychological change you get in the team because of that, they start to look ahead.\"\n\nThe former coach insists that the 31-20 mauling at Murrayfield, where England conceded an early 17-0 deficit, left a lasting \"mental scar\" that subsequently impacted their performance in the five-try rout by Ireland.\n\n\"They got caught on the hop against Scotland. The Scotland game against Wales shows that they were just caught on the hop,\" Jones said.\n\n\"That was a one-off, but now that one-off has crept into their psyche. They’re disappointed about where they are and they’re all feeling a bit threatened now.\"\n\nHe concluded by emphasising the need for strong leadership to navigate the current challenges: \"How do you change it around? It takes leadership on and off the field.\"",

    "fullText": "With the presidential race heating up at FC Barcelona, Joan Laporta has stepped back into the spotlight.\n\nAppearing on 2Cat’s ‘Cafè d’Idees’, the former president, who is now running for re-election, addressed the current state of the club and, most notably, his relationship with head coach Hansi Flick.\n\nLaporta’s media appearance comes shortly after the launch of his book, ‘This is How We Saved Barça’, where he reflects on his leadership between 2021 and 2026.\n\nThe presentation drew significant attention, with key figures such as sporting director Deco and Flick himself in attendance.\n\nThat detail alone showed the unity Laporta is eager to project during his campaign.\n\nDuring the interview, as relayed by Mundo Deprotivo, Laporta spoke openly about Flick and why he values the German coach so highly.\n\n“What I like about him is that you can see he’s living this moment very intensely, not just on the bench, he lives the city, the people,” he began saying.\n\nLaporta also revealed that the coach has privately expressed comfort with continuity at the board level.\n\n“He has said that what he wants is for us to continue the board that I have had the privilege of chairing.\n\nLaporta opened up about his relationship with Flick. (Photo by Eric Alonso/Getty Images)\n\n“It’s understandable because we decided he should be the coach. We have created an environment that is right for him to do his job.\n\n“Then the relationship is very sincere and we are very clear with each other.”\n\nThat alignment between the president and the manager could prove decisive, especially as rivals in the election promise sweeping changes.\n\nLaporta went further, stating, “Flick is happy coaching Barça, but he has said that he is more comfortable if I continue, and I appreciate that.”\n\nHe then criticised campaign narratives focused heavily on transfer speculation.\n\n“What I have, or what we defend, is a team that works very well, and the necessary adjustments will have to be made.\n\n“Talking about signings is wishful thinking. We’re in the middle of the season, and if we made the decisions now, it would be so that the sports management could make adjustments for the summer.\n\n“These stories are just election tactics to win votes, but they’re not serious,” he concluded.",

    "description": "Christian Horner's sudden Red Bull exit will be shown in Netflix’s \"Drive to Survive\" season eight",
    "fullText": "Christian Horner has spoken out about his exit from Red Bull Racing during the eighth season of Netflix's Drive to Survive.\n\nThe docuseries, which will be released on 27 February, will follow the on and off track stories of the 2025 Formula 1 season. The fourth episode, titled A Bull With No Horns, will cover Horner's exit from Red Bull.\n\nAfter being with the team since it joined the grid in 2005, Horner was replaced as Red Bull Racing CEO and team principal in July 2025 by former Racing Bulls team principal Laurent Mekies. The Briton has now had the opportunity to speak about his exit, which he believes was the decision of Oliver Mintzlaff and Helmut Marko.\n\n\"I feel a real sense of loss and hurt. It was all rather sudden. I didn't really get a chance to say a proper goodbye,\" Horner said on Drive to Survive.\n\n\"I never imagined to be in this position. Of course, your immediate reaction when you get delivered a s**t sandwich like that is like, f**k them. I've had something taken away from me that wasn't my choice, that was very precious to me.\n\n\"I only ever gave my best. I did my best for my team, for the people that I represented. But performance this year hasn't been as strong as previously.\"\n\nWhen asked if he thought the Verstappens had anything to do with the decision, Horner added: \"[Max Verstappen's] father has never been my biggest fan. He's been outspoken about me. But I don't believe that the Verstappens were responsible in any way.\n\n\"I think this was a decision that was made by Oliver Mintzlaff, with Helmut advising from the sideline. I think ultimately things changed within the business, within the group. The founder died. And after Dietrich's death, I think probably I was deemed to have maybe too much control.\"\n\nThere have been rumours about Horner returning to the championship following his exit, although a comeback is yet to be confirmed.\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "UFC star Sean O’Malley does not believe Conor Benn will make $15 million with Zuffa Boxing, arguing the British boxer is not a big enough draw to justify that kind of money.\n\nJust a few days ago, news broke that Benn had signed with Zuffa Boxing, making him only the second major addition to the promotion.\n\nThe deal was made even more notable by reports that ‘The Destroyer’ would earn $15 million for just one fight.\n\nBenn’s high-profile signing has drawn plenty of attention, but O’Malley remains sceptical about the figures being thrown around.\n\nBenn, who holds a 24-1 record and was once seen as a rising star, is perhaps more widely recognised for his 2022 failed drug test than anything else.\n\nHowever, his victory over longtime rival Chris Eubank Jr. in November helped raise his profile significantly.\n\nEven so, O’Malley is not convinced that Benn’s contract is really worth the reported $15 million.\n\nSpeaking on his podcast, he questioned whether the 29-year-old is a big enough name to justify such a payout.\n\n“For me, it’s so hard to believe, I did see and I heard it, I’ve been told, but I’m like, that doesn’t mean it’s true,” ‘Suga’ said.\n\n“I don’t know, it could very well be true. I can’t imagine it being true, Zuffa Boxing, it’s like, they’re paying out ($15 million), I don’t even know who Conor Benn is.\n\n“Supposedly he’s like, a pretty big name in boxing but I’ve never f—— heard of him, I’ve never heard of him.\n\n“I could see it being out of an ego thing (by Dana White), I guess as a business thing too you’re bringing in a legit guy.\n\n“If they really paid this Conor Benn guy $15 million, it’s crazy how you can just put in so much work in the UFC, build this name, create this character, be this star and I’m not making f—— $15 million a fight.”\n\nBenn recently called out Ryan Garcia for a WBC world welterweight title fight, even though Zuffa Boxing is not aligning with any of the established sanctioning bodies.\n\nEven so, there could be interest from Dana White and Zuffa Boxing in making that match-up happen, perhaps with their own version of a title on the line.\n\nJake Paul gives verdict on Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao 2 impact\n\nTerence Crawford was beyond hyped watching his son win a wrestling state championship",

    "fullText": "Every year, the football world shifts its attention to one of the most important checkpoints in the pre-draft calendar — the NFL Scouting Combine. Hosted in Indianapolis at Lucas Oil Stadium, the event marks the true beginning of draft season for front offices across the National Football League. It’s where film study meets measurable reality — where speed, explosiveness, strength, and movement skills are tested under a microscope. For prospects, it’s not just an evaluation; it’s a high-stakes job interview played out in front of coaches, executives, and scouts from every team.\n\nThis year’s spotlight centers on the players ranked at the top of Daniel Jeremiah’s latest top prospect board, a group loaded with elite athletic traits and immediate NFL potential. The list reflects the modern direction of the league — explosive edge defenders, versatile defensive backs, dynamic skill players, and quarterbacks capable of handling complex offensive systems. While game tape built their reputations, the combine will test how those traits translate in standardized drills and competitive environments. For some, it’s a chance to confirm elite status. For others, it’s an opportunity to rise dramatically with one standout performance.\n\nAs the drills begin and the testing numbers roll in, these top prospects enter the most revealing phase of their pre-draft journey. The combine won’t finalize their draft positions — but it will shape the conversation around them in a big way.\n\nMendoza carries himself like a true franchise quarterback, showing poise and command in high-pressure situations. His arm talent allows him to make layered throws with timing and precision, while his size helps him absorb contact and stay composed. He processes defenses quickly and rarely looks rushed mentally. Teams see a quarterback who can operate structure but still create when plays break down.\n\nLove is one of the most explosive offensive weapons in the class, capable of scoring from anywhere on the field. His acceleration through the hole and long-speed in open space make him a constant big-play threat. He runs with patience and vision, then flips a switch once he sees daylight. If his testing matches the tape, he’ll solidify elite playmaker status.\n\nBailey is a disruptive edge rusher with the power and burst to stress offensive tackles snap after snap. He plays with physical urgency, attacking the pocket and forcing quarterbacks off their spots. His length helps him control contact and win leverage battles at the line. Evaluators are especially intrigued by how much more upside he still has as his pass-rush toolbox develops.\n\nReese is an explosive athlete off the edge with range that shows up against both the run and pass. He closes space quickly and flashes the ability to wreck plays in the backfield. His pursuit motor stands out — he doesn’t quit on plays and consistently chases down ball carriers. With refinement, he has the traits of a high-impact defensive playmaker.\n\nStyles brings size, speed, and versatility that allow him to impact the game in multiple defensive roles. He moves fluidly in coverage but also plays with downhill force against the run. His physical profile makes him a matchup eraser against modern hybrid offenses. Coaches value defenders who can stay on the field in any situation — Styles fits that mold.\n\nBain is a relentless pass rusher who plays with power, urgency, and technical discipline. He consistently generates pressure by converting speed to strength and attacking leverage points. His intensity shows in how hard he plays every snap, especially in pursuit. He profiles as the type of defender offenses must account for in protection schemes.\n\nTate is a refined route runner who wins with timing, precision, and body control. He tracks the ball naturally and consistently positions himself to make difficult catches look routine. His game is built on reliability — quarterbacks can trust him to be exactly where he’s supposed to be. He projects as a dependable high-volume receiving target.\n\nDelane is a long, athletic corner with strong coverage instincts and physical press ability. He competes aggressively at the catch point and shows confidence challenging receivers downfield. His movement skills allow him to stay attached through routes and recover when needed. He has the traits teams look for in a boundary corner who can handle top matchups.\n\nDowns is a true playmaking safety with range, awareness, and sharp diagnostic skills. He reads offensive concepts quickly and arrives at the ball with decisive speed. Whether in coverage or run support, he consistently impacts plays with sound positioning. His instincts and football IQ make him one of the most complete defensive backs in the class.\n\nLemon is an electric playmaker whose acceleration and agility stand out immediately. He thrives after the catch, turning short receptions into explosive gains with quick cuts and burst. His ability to stretch the field vertically adds another dimension to his game. Offenses will value his versatility and big-play potential from multiple alignments.\n\nUltimately, this group represents the talent expected to define the early portion of the 2026 NFL Draft. The combine serves as both validation and opportunity — confirming what evaluators believe while opening the door for new storylines. From measurable dominance to unexpected breakout performances, this week helps transform top prospects into future professionals.\n\nOLYMPICS: Final 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings\n\nNFL: 4 blockbuster NFL trades we want to see before the 2026 draft\n\nNFL DRAFT: 2026 NFL Scouting Combine day-to-day TV schedule, how to watch\n\nMLB: MLB Power Rankings as 2026 Spring Training begins\n\nNBA: Updated NBA Power Rankings as a new week begins\n\nVIRAL: Watch Johnny Gaudreau’s children join Team USA hockey gold medal celebration\n\nThe post Top draft prospects ahead of the 2026 NFL scouting combine appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Ruben Amorim might be wondering what’s going on after seeing Michael Carrick turn things around, and Gary Neville believes he has a good idea.\n\nCarrick hasn’t had any new signings to work with, yet he’s made the most of what was already there. Wins against Man City and Arsenal set the tone, and a narrow 1-0 victory over Everton extended that unbeaten run to six matches.\n\nAs Carrick continues to add unexpected chapters to a season many had written off after Amorim’s dismissal, Neville believes the impact could reach beyond just the pitch.\n\nThere’s some debate over how much of the credit should go to Ruben Amorim, but even his most loyal backers have to admit they didn’t see this coming from Michael Carrick.\n\nThe team is playing with far more purpose now than during Amorim’s time in charge. Even if it’s still early days, six matches under Carrick already feel different.\n\nOne of the biggest issues was Amorim’s tactical rigidity and reluctance to make changes. That reputation stuck with him throughout his time at the club.\n\nHe once famously said that not even the Pope could convince him to change formation. But Neville thinks this run might force him to reconsider that stance.\n\nHe told Sky Sports’ Gary Neville Podcast: “Ruben Amorim must be sitting there at home watching Manchester United. I mean, I don’t think he’s a guy that will sit there and think that, you know, I can’t believe this is happening. I think he’ll be, you know, he’s worked with a lot of these players and a lot of the staff.\n\n“I think he might be sitting there thinking, ‘what will I do differently in the future when I’m in that same position again when I get another job, and maybe I am sort of being a little bit stubborn and not quite making the changes that the players want.”\n\nNeville’s point about learning from the experience sounds reasonable enough, but if Amorim couldn’t adapt when things were falling apart in front of him, it’s hard to see him changing because someone else fixed it.\n\nHe built his reputation on sticking to his principles, not bending under pressure. Six games without a loss isn’t likely to shift that mindset.\n\nBut the better Carrick does, the more it highlights what went wrong under Amorim. That comparison won’t do his reputation at Old Trafford any favours.\n\nClubs looking at him in the future will want to know if he’s learned anything about flexibility. It’ll be one of the first things he’s asked about in any interview now.\n\nIf Neville is right and Amorim becomes more adaptable, then he could only benefit from it. But based on how he’s handled things so far, that’s a big if.\n\nMan Utd-linked Yan Diomande excels in pressing stat also dominated by Elliot Anderson\n\nMichael Carrick shares honest thoughts on Marcus Rashford leaving Man Utd for Barcelona\n\nWhy Man United legend Patrice Evra brutally slammed ‘delusional’ Arsenal fans",

    "description": "2027 5-star CB John Meredith is reportedly deciding to visit Texas A&M \"at least twice\" this spring, according to a source.",
    "fullText": "Texas A&M's pursuit of 2027 five-star cornerback John Meredith is well-documented, and the Aggies remain the slight favorite to land the blue-chip prospect, who already looks like a future NFL starter based on his elite attributes. Coach Mike Elko and his revamped staff look to host Meredith this spring, and while it has yet to be confirmed, Rivals insider Steve Wiltfong believes the standout defensive back will visit twice over the next two months.\n\nSo far, the Aggies have secured ten commitments in the 2027 cycle, led by four-star cornerback Raylaun Henry, who is close to becoming a five-star prospect after his outstanding play during the 2025 season. If Meredith commits and later signs with Texas A&M, both players, combined with incoming freshman CB Brandon Arrington, represent one of the most talented cornerback rooms Texas A&M has possessed, on paper, at least.\n\nOn Monday, Steve Wiltfong provided several updates for over a dozen 2027 prospects, including John Meredith, and while it's already public knowledge that Alabama and Texas A&M are his top two options, especially after visiting Tuscaloosa before the recruiting dead period. Right now, the Aggies and Alabama are likely guaranteed an official visit, while Ohio State and Texas will look to make a late push.\n\n\"Texas A&M and Alabama top the list for the Fort Worth (Texas) North Crowley blue-chipper who has a keen eye on Ohio State, Texas and others.\n\nWhile the Aggies are the Rivals Prediction Machine (RPM) favorite, Meredith returned to Tuscaloosa last month and had another terrific experience. He said at the Under Armour All-America Game that both programs were 1A and 1B. That continues into the spring.\n\nI expect Meredith to be at Texas A&M at least twice in the spring.\"\n\nTexas A&M received an early prediction of landing Meredith, but that doesn't hold much weight heading into the spring/summer, when prospects prepare to make their final decision, with potential flips becoming more rampant during the fall before Early Signing Day.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: 2027 5-star CB John Meredith to visit Texas A&M 'at least twice'",

    "fullText": "NFL insider Ian Rapoport believes Green Bay Packers quarterback Malik Willis -- who is headed for unrestricted free agency as arguably the top available quarterback -- will eventually sign a deal worth $30 to 35 million per year.\n\n\"If Justin Fields gets $20 million a year, what does Malik Willis get? 30? 35? That's my guess as to what it is,\" Rapoport said on Gregg Rosenthal's \"NFL Daily\" podcast on Monday.\n\nRosenthal, who ranked Willis as his No. 1 free agent this offseason, estimated that the Packers backup quarterback will get a deal between $35 and 40 million, and Rapoport didn't disagree.\n\n\"I think that's probably right,\" Rapoport said.\n\nRapoport and Rosenthal discussed the possibility of Willis landing with the Miami Dolphins (Jeff Hafley and Jon-Eric Sullivan connection) and Arizona Cardinals (Matt and Mike LaFleur connection), but Rapoport wondered if the two teams could afford Willis given the money already committed to Tua Tagovailoa in Miami and Kyler Murray in Arizona.\n\nAt $30 million per year, Willis would slot in as a mid-tier starting quarterback. The top of the market at the position is over $50 million. There is a big gap between Fields, who signed a $20 million deal with the New York Jets last offseason, and the next tier, which features Baker Mayfield, Sam Darnold and Geno Smith in the $30 million to $35 million range.\n\nWillis appears to be in position to easily beat the Fields deal and slot in somewhere in the Mayfield-Darnold-Smith range.\n\nAnd the Packers are looking more and more likely to get a third-round compensatory draft pick in 2027 when Willis signs his next deal.\n\nThe Packers acquired Willis, a 2022 third-round pick, for a seventh-round pick before the 2024 season. Over the last two seasons in Green Bay, Willis resurrected his career -- completing 70 of 89 passes for 972 yards, six touchdown passes and zero interceptions and rushing for 123 yards and two more scores over 11 games and three starts with the Packers.\n\nWillis got a showcase start in primetime against the Ravens in December, and he completed 18 of 21 passes for 288 yards and a touchdown and rushed for 60 yards and two more scores in a defeat.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers Wire: QB Malik Willis could get $30-35 million per year in free agency",

    "description": "The Minnesota Vikings’ spending budget in free agency is slim compared to last year, but that won’t prevent the club […]",
    "fullText": "The Minnesota Vikings’ spending budget in free agency is slim compared to last year, but that won’t prevent the club from onboarding at least a few notable newcomers. And on Monday, two weeks before the start of free agency, The Athletic‘s Alec Lewis directly mentioned defensive tackle John Franklin-Myers as a possible target.\n\nHe’s a name to watch if Minnesota wants a veteran interior disruptor without pushing spending into a new tier.\n\nThe name came out of left field, as many fans didn’t expect Minnesota to target another veteran interior defensive lineman.\n\nAdd him to your possible shortlist of Vikings free-agent targets. Your bingo board.\n\nThe Athletic: Franklin-Myers Could Make Sense for MIN\n\nAnswering fans’ questions from a mailbag, Lewis name-dropped Franklin-Myers this week.\n\nHe first set the stage for Vikings free agency: “The next phase in answering the question is mostly a conversation of positional priorities. Quarterback takes precedence. Because safeties and centers play essential communication roles, veterans could be the answer at these positions, too. Running back and defensive line would likely be next in line.”\n\n“So, it’s worth looking at potential signings through that prism. Take on a boatload of cap space at quarterback, and the Vikings would need some savvy signings elsewhere. Pay minimally at QB, and the Vikings could try to go big on a defensive lineman, like Denver Broncos defensive tackle John Franklin-Myers (whom The Athletic’s Daniel Popper projected could make around $54 million over three seasons).”\n\nMinnesota also needs roster help at cornerback and safety, so the Franklin-Myers tidbit raised some eyebrows.\n\nLewis added, “As difficult as it may be to see, there is a path for the Vikings to extend money into the future and invest aggressively over the next two years. This would make for a flurry of activity over the next few weeks.”\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams drafted Franklin-Myers in Round 4 of the 2018 NFL Draft, and he’s played for two more teams since: the New York Jets in 2020-2023 and the Denver Broncos in 2024-2025. The 29-year-old has appeared in 114 games, starting 83, and collecting 200 total tackles, 34 sacks, 94 quarterback hits, and 35 tackles for loss. The man has hit his groove in Denver and will cash in handsomely from free agency in two weeks.\n\nHere’s his resume from Pro Football Focus:\n\n2018: 65.1\n2019: DNP\n2020: 71.5\n2021: 80.3\n2022: 82.6\n2023: 70.4\n2024: 78.3\n2025: 61.9\n\nFranklin-Myers ranked fifth in sacks last year among all interior defensive linemen.\n\nPFF’s Ryan Smith recently noted on Franklin-Myers, “Franklin-Myers has been an important piece for one of the league’s best defenses in Denver the last two seasons, generating 96 pressures and 41 defensive stops over that span. He’s been a consistently productive player over the course of his career, as he generated at least 50 pressures in every season from 2020-2024, earning PFF overall grades of 70.4 or higher in each year.”\n\n“While there appears to be mutual interest in a return to Denver, it may be tough for the organization to bring him back after they signed cornerback Patrick Surtain II, EDGE Nik Bonitto and interior defender Zach Allen to big extensions in recent years. Should he hit the open market, there should be no shortage of suitors for the 29-year-old’s services in free agency.”\n\nIt’s unclear if the Vikings will release Hargrave or Allen this offseason — Hargrave is a more likely cap casualty than Allen — but if neither man is cut loose, Minnesota will boast its deepest defensive tackle room in decades, perhaps ever.\n\nWith Franklin-Myers in the mix, the group would look like this:\n\nAt a glance, that unit looks “too deep,” meaning a Franklin-Myers signing would likely require Hargrave, for example, to be dropped by interim general manager Rob Brzeinski to make room.\n\nMore Aging DTs after Allen and Hargrave?\n\nIn 2025, when the Vikings embarked on their huge spending spree, former general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah doubled up on veteran defensive tackles: Hargrave and Allen. Neither was terrible in 2025, but neither achieved the envisioned impact.\n\nIn fact, almost all DT headlines arrived courtesy of Redmond, who might’ve been the team’s second-best player overall behind wide receiver Justin Jefferson.\n\nFranklin-Myers will turn 30 in September. Would Minnesota really spend another large contract on an aging interior defensive lineman? The draft feels like a more likely destination, as rookies Caleb Banks (Florida), Kayden McDonald (Ohio State), and Peter Woods (Clemson, to name a few, headline April’s class.\n\nSpotrac estimates that Franklin-Myers’s next contract will pay him $7.9 million per season.",

    "description": "With a theoretical model of breakfast, can we derive the existence of “dark breakfasts,” breakfasts that we know must exist, but have never observed?",
    "fullText": "It started with a flash of insight like a thunderbolt in a snow storm, the sort of insight that can only be induced by high altitude hypoxia and making breakfast.\n\n“Breakfast is a vector space. You can place pancakes, crepes, and scrambled eggs on a simplex where the variables are the ratios between milk, eggs, and flour. We have explored too little of this manifold. More breakfasts can exist than we have known.”\n\nLike all such hypoxia-addled-brain thoughts, it was a successful tweet.\n\nI stood in the kitchen paralyzed by indecision. The mixing bowl was in front of me, the milk, eggs, and flour next to it, all of them individually as familiar as they had been a moment before, but now the possibilities for their combination were just too great. Breakfast was now an alien fractal intruding on our world like the lighthouse at the end of Annihilation. The thoughts came unbidden.\n\n“In the manifold of breakfast, are there empty subspaces? Might there be breakfasts that no one has ever had? With a theoretical model of breakfast, can we derive the existence of ‘dark breakfasts,’ breakfasts that we know must exist, but have never observed?”\n\nThe curtain of reality had pulled back for me, and I could no longer pretend to be ignorant of these eldritch possibilities. I furiously began to map the known breakfasts. If the dark breakfast exists, I must be able to find it in the interstices of the normal familiar world.\n\nFirst I mapped all that I could recall from memory, pancakes, crepes, waffles, scrambled eggs, popovers, omelettes, and on and on, scouring my brain for every fast I had ever broken. The beginnings of the contours of breakfast began to reveal themselves. A gaping hole stared back at me, but I couldn’t yet be sure. I had to search the dark corners of the world to see if somewhere in far off lands that abyss had yet been filled. I called upon friendly ghosts. I paged through ancient tomes. I added kaiserschmarrn, swedish pancakes, dan bing, madeleines, crumpets, clafoutis, blinis, pannu kakku, parathas, nalesniki. The map filled in bit by bit, but it was no use. The gap in the fabric of breakfast remained.\n\nI searched for benign explanations. Could it be that milk is simply too heavy, and that by including the weight of the water content that boils off I am tilting the simplex too far in its direction? Could it be that by excluding slices of bread as ingredients since they aren’t raw flour and do not go in a mixing bowl, I have excluded breakfasts like french toast, eggs in a basket, breakfast burritos, and breakfast sandwiches that might yet have saved us? Could I have overlooked some arcane culture that breaks their fast with dumplings or egg noodles? None of these satisfied me. The Abyss stared back.\n\nThe breakfasts I was able to identify cluster into three major regions:\n\nI was days into my research before I finally found a clue. In an obscure document on the website of the International House of Pancakes Corporation there was a hint that the dark breakfast had been made. IHOP omelettes include pancake batter. While I cannot place IHOP omelettes exactly on the map, by interpolating between pancakes and omelettes, we can bound where they must occur, and confirm that the manifold possibilities do indeed pass through the Dark Breakfast Abyss.\n\nWe do not know why the Dark Breakfast Abyss is empty. But by anthropic reasoning, we should conclude that it is empty for good reason. The International House of Pancakes is playing a dangerous game. If someday a remote IHOP splashes a little too much batter in their omelette, cooks the Forbidden Breakfast, and thereby brings about the end of the world, well, at least we know the Waffle House will be open.\n\nFor breakfast scholars who wish to further my study, I offer my data and code. If you are so foolhardy that you wish to explore the bounds of dark breakfast yourself, the recipe is as follows:\n\nThe most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: NCA’s Alex Murray says he hopes new £115m police AI centre can limit unfairness found in tools\n\n‘It’s not Robocop’: UK police embrace AI ‘efficiency’ in complex investigations\n\nA police chief has admitted artificial intelligence used to boost crime fighting will contain bias but pledged to combat the risks.\n\nLabour wants a dramatic expansion of police use of AI within England and Wales, with police chiefs also believing it could help keep law enforcement up to date with new criminal threats.\n\nAlex Murray told the Guardian that a new national police AI centre would recognise the risks of bias and minimise them.\n\nBias in use of AI in policing could result in instances where algorithms – often trained on historical data reflecting past human prejudices – systematically produce unfair outcomes, such as overtargeting minority communities or misidentifying individuals based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status.\n\nMurray, the director of threat leadership with the National Crime Agency, and the national lead for AI, said: “Once you’ve recognised and minimised [bias], how do you train officers to deal with outputs to ensure that it is further minimised?\n\n“If you talk about live facial recognition or predictive policing, there will be bias, and you need to get in the data scientists and the data engineers to clean the data, to train the model appropriately, and then to test it.\n\n“There is no point releasing something to policing that has bias in it that’s not recognised, and everything should be done to minimise it to a level where it can be understood and mitigated.”\n\nExamples of bias have already surfaced in the police use of retrospective facial recognition, which is powered by AI. That is where a suspect is compared with a database of images after a crime.\n\nLive facial recognition, which is more controversial and is used less by policing, hunts for suspects in real time, and also contains bias. A report in December found that a retrospective facial recognition system used by police had been used with inadequate safeguards.\n\nThe Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC), which oversees local forces in England and Wales, said: “System failures have been known for some time, yet these were not shared with those communities affected, nor with leading sector stakeholders.”\n\nThe APCC forensic science lead, Darryl Preston, who is the police and crime commissioner for Cambridgeshire, said: “The discovery of an in-built bias in the police national database’s retrospective facial recognition system, even if only in limited circumstances, demonstrates the need for independent oversight of these powerful tools.\n\n“It is not acceptable for technology to be used unless and until it has been thoroughly tested to eliminate bias. That clearly was not the case in this instance.”\n\nThe new national AI centre, costing £115m, would aim to reduce bias, said Murray, as well as assessing and deciding what products from private suppliers work. Currently each of the forces across the UK makes its own decisions, which is seen as slow and wasteful.\n\nMurray said police were in an “arms race” with criminals who were using the technology: “Anyone with imagination can use AI.”\n\nIn one case a paedophile claimed images showing him involved in the abuse of children was a deepfake, which police then had to disprove to get him convicted.\n\nMurray said the benefits of AI were far beyond the “cliche around Minority Report and predictive policing”.\n\nHe added that across a range of crimes and challenges facing policing, AI ranged from being a help to a gamechanger, but a human police officer will have to make the final decisions about what to do about the results AI produces.\n\nHe said it could help police deal with political agitators who infect social media with fake images to try to trigger violence on the streets.\n\nIn time, Murray said, it could help with manhunts, or speed up searches for cars linked to suspects and save the hundreds of hours it takes for detectives to trawl through extensive CCTV footage, or speed up the search of seized digital devices from suspects in the hunt for incriminating evidence.\n\n“What took days, weeks, sometimes months can potentially take hours,” he said.\n\nIn one recent case, four Luton-based suspects were arrested for attacks on – and thefts from – cashpoints. Police downloaded the data from the suspects’ phones and, thanks to AI, secured guilty pleas within weeks.\n\nThe data was in Romanian and AI scoured through it, translated it, identified the material relating to potential crimes, identified the offences and presented it all in a package for detectives.\n\nTrevor Rodenhurst, chief constable of the Bedfordshire force, told the Guardian: “This allowed us to draw evidence from lots of devices with a vast quantity of data, which we would otherwise not have been able to do.”\n\nRodenhurst said that as officers use AI and see its benefits, it is changing the view of the frontline: “They are no longer suspicious, they are asking when they can have it. That capability is transformative.”",

    "fullText": "Anthropic says three Chinese firms used ‘distillation’ technique to extract information from its Claude chatbot\n\nUS artificial intelligence company Anthropic said on Monday it had uncovered campaigns by three Chinese AI firms to illicitly extract capabilities from its Claude chatbot, in what it described as industrial-scale intellectual property theft. OpenAI leveled similar charges last month.\n\nAnthropic said DeepSeek, Moonshot AI and MiniMax used a technique known as “distillation” – using outputs from a more powerful AI system to rapidly boost the performance of a less capable one.\n\n“These campaigns are growing in intensity and sophistication,” the company said in a statement. “The window to act is narrow.”\n\nDistillation is a common practice within AI development, often used by companies to create cheaper, smaller versions of their own models.\n\nThe practice grabbed headlines a year ago when the release of a low-cost generative AI model from DeepSeek performed at a similar level to ChatGPT and other top American chatbots, upending assumptions of US dominance in the sensitive sector.\n\nAnthropic said the companies achieved their ends through approximately 16m exchanges with its Claude model and 24,000 fake accounts.\n\nThese allowed the three labs to siphon off capabilities they had not independently developed at a fraction of the cost – and in so doing circumvented export controls on powerful US technology intended to preserve American dominance in AI.\n\nThe company argued the practice posed national security risks, saying models built through illicit distillation are unlikely to retain safety guardrails designed to prevent misuse – such as restrictions on helping develop bioweapons or enabling cyberattacks.\n\nAnthropic’s arch-rival OpenAI, creator of ChatGPT, made similar accusations to US lawmakers earlier this month, saying Chinese companies were using the technique amid “ongoing efforts to free-ride on the capabilities developed by OpenAI and other US frontier labs”.\n\nAnthropic said MiniMax ran the largest operation, generating more than 13m exchanges. Each campaign concentrated heavily on coding, agentic reasoning and tool use – areas where Claude is considered a leader.\n\nTo circumvent Anthropic’s ban on commercial access from China, the labs allegedly routed traffic through proxy services that managed the vast networks of fraudulent accounts.\n\nAnthropic called for coordinated industry and government responses to address what it said no single company could tackle alone.",

    "fullText": "We explore the strange food-obsessed world of a new game whose tech was once called ‘an insult to life itself’ by Hayao Miyazaki, the film-maker behind Spirited Away\n\nA strange piece of software has recently landed on the PC gaming store Steam. And “software” feels like the cleanest way to describe it. Existing somewhere between a full-blown life sim, a science project and a kind of haunted fish tank, Anlife: Motion-learning Life Evolution probably would have disappeared without making much impact if it wasn’t for one unusual factor. Several years ago some of its creators were absolutely roasted on camera by one of the genuine legends of Japanese animation.\n\nBack in 2016, Hayao Miyazaki, the director of movies such as Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, was shown new technology that used AI in order to animate models. Faced with a zombie that utilised its head to move by knocking its skull against the ground and wriggling its body like a fish, Miyazaki declared what he had seen was “an insult to life itself”. It’s hard not to watch the clip without feeling slightly seared – but now, a decade later, the ashen-faced developers from that room have sufficiently recovered to make their work widely available.\n\nJudging by the chatter surrounding the launch, at least some of the people downloading Anlife are doing so in the hope that it might provide some kind of indication of the current state video games’ relationship with AI. Putting aside the often broad use of that term, this is certainly a thing that’s worth trying to understand, whether it’s because of the job losses caused by AI or blamed on AI, or the sheer number of games made with the assistance of AI models now landing on storefronts such as Steam.\n\nThere’s a problem here, though. And it’s that Anlife itself is such a cheerfully inconsequential thing that it’s hard to read too much of anything into it.\n\nAnlife promises players an evolution simulator where “AI-driven block creatures move in unexpected ways.” What this comes down to for the most part involves placing a range of different creatures into a small environment and then watching as they learn to get around.\n\nVisually Anlife is pure Frutiger Aero, offering landscapes of green valleys and sparkling water that could be the kind of soothing images MRI technicians sometimes encourage you to look at during a lengthy scan. Sonically it’s equally inoffensive: with a range of bloops, bleeps and popping sounds, we’re pitched right into the soundtrack of a million 00s day spas.\n\nThis desire to soothe permeates to the level of mechanics, too. Over the course of an idle morning with Anlife you can place a range of simple creatures in the environment and then give them food that will encourage them to breed or mutate. You can expand your territory and then lure creatures towards water or up into the air in order to create more variations. There are plenty of things to unlock (including a shadow tech tree that has you covered if you want to annihilate your digital sea monkeys rather than watching them flourish) but the ecosystem is kept simple. It’s a game about watching how things decide to crawl towards food.\n\nThe thrill of all of this presumably comes down to the “how” in that last sentence. This is where the game’s slightly mysterious use of AI is probably involved. And it’s true that, after a few hours of play, you’ll have Anlife’s funny little blob creatures exploring new kinds of joints and body arrangements as they swim and fly and generally roll around eating.\n\n(AI has a history of being used to make creatures walk around, incidentally, often using small neural networks and computer evolution. In 2009, the UK-based games technology company NaturalMotion developed a project in which a bipedal model learned to walk using evolved neural networks. The company was subsequently bought by Zynga in 2014.\n\nThere are two problems, however, the first being that the focus on unlocking the skill tree gives the opening hours of Anlife the feel of a rather mindless clicker game that it struggles to shake off. The second comes down to something that I gather people studying procedural generation sometimes refer to as “the oatmeal problem”.\n\nThe oatmeal problem, which was first formulated by writer, developer and academic Kate Compton, hinges on the fact that every single bowl of oatmeal in the universe is unique. Just not in a very interesting way. Similarly, when Anlife’s creatures discover a new way of rolling or bouncing or flapping their bodies towards food, they’re still just moving towards food. It makes for a game that’s either about really, really paying attention to tiny variations in detailing, or about completely zoning out and just enjoying the floaty aesthetic. Over the course of my time with Anlife, I’ve generally started with the first approach and then discovered, after 10 minutes, that I’ve slid into the second.\n\nThe more I played Anlife, the more I ended up thinking about something I heard from one of the first AI researchers I ever spoke to, all the way back in 2013. The real value of AI, they explained – and I am paraphrasing here – is that it could one day become a completely alien form of intelligence. Which means that us humans would have the lens of a different kind of mind through which to see ourselves and our quirks and cognitive fallacies – things that can be hard to spot when you’re talking to people who think in a very similar way to you.\n\nSince then the apparent focus for a lot of companies such as OpenAI seems to be completely the opposite: creating mimetic plagiarism machines that sometimes seem to exist only to tell people what they already want to hear.\n\nIt feels as if Anlife is filling a very small and specific niche. It isn’t trying to disguise its AI use, as far as I am aware. It’s actually trying to draw attention to the way it uses AI to allow its little creatures to move around. It’s not just a game born of AI, in other words. It’s a game that in some small way is actually about AI. It wants to be slightly alien. It doesn’t want to hide itself or ingratiate; it wants to examine AI’s innate capacity for otherness.",

    "fullText": "When the most profound human emotion becomes an automated transaction in an online shop, the techlords have won\n\nThe Guardian reported on the arrival of “Fate” and, friends, I laughed. Or maybe I cried.\n\nIt’s apparently the first “agentic AI dating app”. An AI personality named “Fate” interviews users, runs data matches on their hopes and dreams, then suggests five potential matches based on the hard data of observable complementary language patterning, “No swiping involved!”.\n\nIt has been followed by similar AI-based matching platforms Sitch and Keeper in the US. In the platform variations, you can detail preference data down to hair colour, you can be coached in how to approach your date by the animated electronic voice of a dataset, and you can weep for the end of human connection and the loveless wasteland of consumer narcissism we have built for ourselves. When the most profound and transformative of human emotions is an automated transaction in an online shop, the techlords have won.\n\nIn the depths of my growing neo-Luddite despair I am obliged to admit that in what is now a common-denominator story, consumers did not actually demand this.\n\nWhat people wanted from AI in dating apps has been superseded by what some data-hungry, rich-dork megacorp thinks that they should need. Studies in Europe showed users just wanted AI tools to “weed out fake profiles and flag toxic users”.\n\nYou know, how writers just wanted contextual proofing tools from AI but and got machines insisting on the superiority of rewritten, flattened text. Or how academics just wanted a tool to index their references and got hallucinations that invented a few sources that didn’t actually exist, but the machine thought maybe should.\n\nInsert your own industry experience here, and all of us in sad recognition that the forced AI-ification of everyday life continues with a robotic efficiency that, dear Christ, is outsourcing the messy human weirdness that made us fascinating and exotic to one another – and sexy and wonderful.\n\nWe’re clearly adopting the universal deadening of human experience because, as the Guardian piece reveals, people are using these new apps – in love, in work and in an educational setting that ensures students learn how to prompt and little else.\n\nI conjecture humanity just can’t handle the mess or wonder of ourselves any more and, as is habit, the internet is to blame.\n\nThe problem with AI as a romantic channel used to be the risk of falling in love with the mirror-machine. With a few personalised prompts you could create a fantasy soulmate that flattered your vanities and ignored your faults as it spoke back to you and you wanked. It was just like a real relationship but without the obliged mutual self-reflection that encourages intimacy and growth.\n\nIt was only a few minutes ago that we thought encouraging this was destructive digital narcissism. Now I keep wondering if there’s a human self-survival instinct in it after all, given what our self-subscription to the mass digital surveillance state is doing to us socially.\n\nIt wasn’t long ago that social media introduced us to the concept of digitised network oversharing. From the video of the dude who wondered what it would be like to pash his sister (no, I will not share it) to the health of novelist Joyce Carol Oates’ feet (no, again), we all seemed to be learning way too much about one another.\n\nNow, from an abundance of caution, we know less. As every stray, 10-year-old tweet can be weaponised, so it seems many are retracting to a new paranoia when it comes to self-revelation. Well may we say “publish and be damned” but you can’t impose privacy controls on your ex.\n\nI’ve written before about this new undersharing. Today it’s disquieting to feel nostalgia for the pre-Fate era privacy appeal of digital Heathcliffs and text-based waifus who were only ever going to share your most intimate secrets with the, um, billionaires who own them rather than consolidate a dataset to manifest them into your life.\n\nBut whether you choose to love the robot or prompt the robot to do the loving for you, the Canadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan predicted these unnatural transhuman intimacies more than half a century ago in Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man. He warned back in 1964 that interactive media would take a lease of “our eyes and ears and nerves” and I think about it all the time.\n\nMcLuhan’s work was the inspiration for David Cronenberg’s 1983 body-horror, Videodrome. Given that a study from Italian researchers has proved that if you’re still dipping into the ideological pissoir known as X, you are wilfully brainwashing yourself with hard-right piss, on the Videodrome scale of remaining in objective reality to believing you are being blown by a television, it’s fair to say that the remote control is in our hand and the TV has entered the chat.\n\nCan we put it down? Perhaps not without the help of intervention by the law, given arguments made in a landmark case before a jury in Los Angeles, in which plaintiffs insist that social media platforms are “defective products engineered to exploit vulnerabilities in young people’s brains”, as reported by NPR.\n\nThe outcome may indeed compel governments to pursue further the platform regulation that has inspired social media bans for children in Australia, Malaysia and elsewhere.\n\nDo we have to wait until “AI-rranged marriage” becomes a thing before governments realise we’re running out of time?\n\nRoll over, humanity. Fate is here.",

    "description": "Kraft Heinz's budget cuts over the past decade made it \"too lean,\" hurting its financial results, CEO Steve Cahillane said.",
    "fullText": "Kraft Heinz, the company known for hot dogs, ketchup, and mac and cheese, has gone hungry for too long, according to its new CEO.\n\nThe company, created in 2015 through a high-profile merger by private-equity firm 3G Capital, made deep cost cuts a focus of its strategy for managing big food brands like Oscar Mayer and Jell-O.\n\nSteve Cahillane, who became Kraft Heinz's CEO last month, says the cost-cutting went too far.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference in Orlando, Cahillane said that the cuts hurt Kraft Heinz's financial results. The company's shares are down roughly 74% from their 2017 high, and it expects organic net sales to decline between 1.5% and 3.5% this year.\n\n\"If you don't have the people and the capabilities, it's really difficult to deliver,\" he said. \"We've been operating too lean, and we acknowledge that, and we're going to fix it.\"\n\nUnder previous management, Kraft Heinz cut costs through zero-based budgeting, a method that requires managers to justify every cost anew rather than carry them over from a previous budget.\n\nThe approach led some Kraft Heinz employees to bring their own coffee to work — the food giant owns Maxwell House coffee — and pinch pennies on office supplies, Business Insider reported in 2021.\n\n3G Capital exited its investment in Kraft Heinz in 2023, according to a filing with the SEC. Berkshire Hathaway, another major shareholder over the past decade, appears to be considering an exit of its own after taking a $3.8 billion write-down on its Kraft Heinz stock last year.\n\nUnder Cahillane, Kraft Heinz plans to spend $600 million in order to rebuild some of that lost muscle by investing in several parts of the company, from research and development to marketing.\n\nThe company is also hitting pause on a planned break-up, Cahillane said when the company reported its fourth-quarter earnings earlier this month.\n\nKraft Heinz is also experimenting with new products. At Thursday's conference presentation, for example, Cahillane said the company has started selling its Capri-Sun drink in plastic bottles, which are easier to sell as single servings than in its traditional pouches. Early results show that the bottles are increasing Capri-Sun's popularity with teenagers, Cahillane said.\n\n\"These brands are so iconic, so special, so well known,\" Cahillane said. \"But unfortunately, for too long, we have been relying too much on only that.\"\n\n\"We need to make these brands relevant for today,\" he added.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "How hedge funds became a bright spot in a nasty job market",
    "description": "Hedge funds have a glut of money and not enough talent to invest it. So they're building a career ladder for young talent",
    "fullText": "Izzy Englander's Millennium has a problem. The firm has $86.3 billion and not nearly enough people to invest it.\n\nMore than any other hedge fund, Millennium has tried to solve this talent shortage through flexibility.\n\nIt's been flexible about where its portfolio managers live, allowing a select few to set up in tax havens such as Puerto Rico and Dubai. It lets some PMs start their own firms while continuing to manage Millennium's money. It has offered eye-watering sums to poach top earners from rival firms. And it's been flexible about what it trades, expanding to asset classes such as commodities and private credit in recent years — new areas for a firm that has dozens of teams trading stocks and bonds.\n\nBut Millennium's pile of cash has grown by more than $30 billion since 2022. Hiring 160 PMs in 2024, handing over billions to outside funds to invest in 2025 — and all that flexibility — has not been enough to keep up.\n\nThe firm is now trying a more conventional approach to growing its ranks: It's building a pipeline. Starting in 2027, Millennium will launch an investing internship program for graduating college seniors that comes with \"hands-on experience working with senior portfolio managers,\" the firm tells Business Insider. The program will have slots for at least 20 investing-obsessed college students, and top performers will have the opportunity to become full-time analysts.\n\nIt's the latest sign that hedge funds, especially the four major multistrategy funds, Millennium, Citadel, Point72, and Balyasny, are growing up, moving from lean operations led by a star investor to sprawling trading behemoths with recruiting and training programs that rival those of the investment banks.\n\nAt a time when many corporate ladders are shrinking, multistrategy hedge funds are growing theirs, extending from internships to entry-level training programs to analyst roles to a coveted seat as a portfolio manager. Balyasny, the $30 billion manager, is rolling out its Catalyst program for new college grads in 2027. Citadel and Point72, which have longer-running development programs, have scaled up recruitment on college campuses while ramping up internship and other training programs.\n\nThe seriousness with which funds are taking the job of cultivating young talent was underscored late last month, when Steve Cohen, Point72's billionaire founder and CEO, spent nearly an hour listening to the firm's recent grads pitch stocks.\n\n\"It's really important to the firm that everybody from the top down is involved,\" said Jaimi Goodfriend, head of investment professional development at the $45.7 billion manager, who attended the meeting with Cohen.\n\nBut in solving their biggest challenge — finding fresh talent — are these mega funds, which are known for outside-the-box, diversified investing styles, creating another problem?\n\nThere are concerns, voiced by fellow hedge funds and central bankers alike, that multistrategy firms are moving in unison, increasing market volatility for all. Others warn the funds could lose their edge by shifting their focus from recruiting battle-tested killers to creating lifers hired straight out of college.\n\nAs an investor in some of the industry's biggest firms put it: \"Do you still know how to hunt if you were raised in captivity?\"\n\nThis shift toward more professionalized hedge funds can be traced back in part to 2022. As global equity markets plunged, the strong performance of multistrategy platforms led to a surge in assets. That's only continued, and the firms are adding dozens, if not hundreds, of investors annually, just to maintain the status quo.\n\nThe demand has unleashed a talent war, raising the bar for what firms will pay to poach talent from rivals and retain their own top investors. Last year, Englander poached a top stock-picker at Balyasny with a pay package that could earn him $100 million. Even underperforming PMs are seen as ripe for poaching, forcing funds to think about potential levers they can pull — such as impressive-sounding titles — to increase retention.\n\nThere's broad agreement the situation is unsustainable. The talent war has pushed up costs, which pushed down net returns, which pushed up the number of complaints from the firm's backers. Smaller funds, struggling to keep up, have gone out of business.\n\nBank trading desks, meanwhile, have shrunk significantly since the 2008 financial crisis, forcing hedge funds to look beyond traditional hiring pools for young talent.\n\n\"You can't only hire from the outside,\" Gerald Beeson, Citadel's COO, who joined the $65 billion firm as an intern in 1993, said in an interview. \"You need to develop even more talent internally now.\"\n\nThe accelerated trajectory that funds can now offer has been a point of pride for funds and a major selling point to young talent.\n\nAt recent goal-setting meetings, Ken Griffin, Citadel's billionaire founder and CEO, asked his executive team for examples of big projects or tasks assigned to new hires, Beeson said.\n\n\"Someone two years out of school can work on something complex and have a significant impact on our business,\" Beeson said.\n\nFor those who want to trade at the top multistrategy firms, that career path now starts before the legal drinking age and can culminate in a coveted PM seat by age 30.\n\nThose running books typically get a base salary in the mid-six figures and, more importantly, a significant chunk of the portfolio's gains — sometimes up to 30%. The position requires a \"moment-by-moment paranoia\" about potential losses, one former PM told Business Insider, yet a decent year at a big firm can translate to millions of dollars in compensation.\n\nMillennium's new internship scheme will be the firm's second, joining its similar program for aspiring quant researchers.\n\nCatalyst, Balyasny's nine-month training program for recent college graduates, will include around 25 interns when it launches in the summer of 2027. It will join a suite of Balyasny's other early-career offerings, including the firm's ATLAS fellowship, launched in 2021 for high school students from underrepresented backgrounds; its Bridger training program for new hires from the sell-side making the move across the street; and its Anthem program for top analysts preparing to become PMs.\n\nFunds like D.E. Shaw, Viking Global, and Rokos have also stepped up their internships and training programs and are hiring more recent graduates and early-career investors, though they do not make as many total hires given their smaller headcounts.\n\n\"Half of the battle in becoming a PM is getting in the right situation,\" said Will Scott, who heads up Balyasny's Catalyst and Bridger programs and was previously a PM.\n\nGetting in the door as early as possible is the \"better path\" for aspiring hedge fund investors since the firm has already invested in their success, he said.\n\nAt Citadel's midtown Manhattan offices, a talent and recruitment center now occupies an entire floor. The space includes a dedicated concierge team and a curved 8-by-25-foot TV displaying stats about the firm and videos of employees working in their day-to-day roles. There's a discreet entrance that lets external candidates bypass the building's main lobby, so their visit doesn't become the day's gossip.\n\n\"You don't understand the importance of talent until you're here,\" said Sjoerd Gehring, the chief people officer, who joined Citadel from Apple in 2024.\n\nLast year, Citadel and its sister market-making firm, Citadel Securities, received 108,000 applications for its 2025 internship programs, a 20% spike from the year before. The firms ultimately hired just 0.6% of applicants.\n\nTo increase the odds of picking the right people, Citadel brought on Keith McNulty, a longtime McKinsey executive with a doctorate in math, as the firm's first head of assessments. Among his duties will be to build up systems to \"help us make better, data-driven, and more informed hiring decisions,\" Gehring said, including by identifying the personality traits that the firm's top employees have within their tens of thousands of applicants for entry-level roles.\n\nIt can be a heavy lift, operationally, to build out development programs and recruiting arms. It was also a significant philosophical shift for funds known to be cutthroat about cutting underperformers.\n\nEach fund has taken a unique approach to building the path.\n\nPoint72 — taking inspiration from Cohen's other endeavor as the owner of the New York Mets — produces \"baseball cards\" for its young investing talent. The cards, part of customized development plans the firm has developed for 300 analysts, highlight areas of strength in addition to ways that each can up their game.\n\nBalyasny is also looking for data-driven ways to set up its newer team members for success.\n\nThe firm uses personality tests to match trainees and junior hires with PMs based on factors such as temperament, which ultimately can help reduce turnover, said Scott, who will run the firm's new Catalyst program along with Bridger. Graduates from the Bridger program, which started in 2022, now account for a fifth of the firm's stockpicking analysts, Scott said.\n\nNew portfolio managers often work with an executive coach, said Ilan Weiss, a technology PM who also trains up-and-coming Balyasny analysts who want to run their own book.\n\n\"Frankly, it's not that much different from a therapist,\" Weiss said, adding that the coaching is built around the idea that investing is an emotional exercise as well as an intellectual one.\n\nAcross the leading multistrategy funds, the focus on development has made the PM role more of a teaching role instead of a solo effort. As Weiss put it, \"You're Steph Curry, and you're Steve Kerr,\" the star player and coach for the NBA's Golden State Warriors.\n\nBalyasny cofounder Scott Schroeder said the firm has actively worked to \"build an incentive system that rewards development.\" It's common for PMs, for example, to get some type of economic interest when one of their top analysts leaves their team to run their own book.\n\n\"In this business, people are incentivized by where they can perform and where they can make the most money,\" Schroeder said.\n\nPoint72 and Citadel, the two firms that have been focused on their pipeline the longest, say their efforts are paying off.\n\nHalf of Citadel's stock-picking portfolio managers and two-thirds of PMs in its fixed income and macro investing group were developed in-house.\n\nAt Point72, more than 230 graduates of its training academy have gone on to get full-time jobs at the firm, while graduates of LaunchPoint, its emerging manager program for promising analysts looking to take the next step, account for 60% of the firm's stock-picking portfolio managers.\n\nFor an industry known for extraordinary paydays and cultivating mercenaries who jump to the highest bidder, there are risks inherent in a softer approach to staffing and culture. The challenge of building out their ranks and recruiting more at early-career levels is safeguarding what makes hedge funds so successful.\n\nThe industry started as a way to protect against the dangers of groupthink in the markets, zigging while others all zagged — hence the word \"hedge\" in the name.\n\nHedge funds, especially in their early iterations decades ago, were run by outside-the-box thinkers, cast-offs, weirdos, numbers-obsessed academics, and more who made their own name instead of climbing the corporate ladder. Griffin famously installed a satellite dish atop his Harvard dorm to get real-time stock prices. Cohen's competitive drive manifested itself early in high-school poker games, where he would make hundreds of dollars a night off his friends.\n\nTheir main selling point, especially for the multistrategy firms, remains the same: Catering to high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors, hedge funds blend cutting-edge technology, data, and old-fashioned brainpower and creativity into an investment product designed to perform well no matter how markets are doing.\n\nIf the people who do the trading act in lockstep, it could change how the fund acts in choppy markets and impact the bottom line. Industry watchers have pointed to instances in which significant sums are run in similar ways across multistrategy firms — typically, smaller, less risky bets that are then juiced up with borrowed money from banking partners — which could lead to market volatility if PMs are forced to sell positions quickly to cut losses.\n\nIn other words, if all of your investors are trained in the same way, will they all be making the same trade?\n\nThe multistrategy behemoths have mostly waved this concern away. The baseline skills early-career employees learn are only a toolkit, they say. What they build is entirely up to them.\n\nAt Point72, Goodfriend points to the wide net the firm casts in recruiting: In the Academy's decade-plus run, the firm has hired from more than 80 schools, and only about half its recruits were business majors, while the rest had engineering or liberal arts backgrounds. AI tools will help level the playing field for data fluency, she added, allowing more room for creativity.\n\n\"There's no way of teaching them how to model that makes them the same,\" Goodfriend said. \"Creativity can be pretty idiosyncratic. We do try to hire a lot of creative people.\"\n\nThere's also a risk that the shift away from the funds' eat-what-you-kill-and-go-hungry-if-you-don't ethos could deter some potential hires and feed a cultural divide.\n\nWhen Paul Singer's $80 billion manager, Elliott, underwent an organizational restructuring years ago on the recommendation of Bain consultants, it created management layers with a top-down reporting structure and an all-powerful investment committee at the head. As Business Insider previously reported, this has not stopped the firm from raising money and hiring top-notch external talent, but some long-tenured investors and executives left for rivals or launched their own funds to get away from the new bureaucracy.\n\nOne complaint was that the manager had become too regimented in its career path and titles, with one former employee bemoaning that the firm had become more akin to a private equity giant.\n\nAny down-the-road concerns are outweighed by the urgency the fund founders feel to attract young, ambitious people and develop the next generation.\n\nMost people are not looking to change jobs constantly, industry executives say. \"It feels much more like people are pursuing a career instead of a job,\" said Gehring, Citadel's chief people officer.\n\n\"I think people more and more want to know that they're making the right choice, and they're not going to have to look for a new job in a couple of years. And we agree. It's a bad investment for us to only have somebody on board for a couple of years,\" she said.\n\n\"We're talking about a career path. We don't want people to leave.\"\n\nBradley Saacks is a correspondent at Business Insider, covering hedge funds and other asset managers.",

    "fullText": "Prospective homebuyers are seeing the lowest 30-year fixed mortgage rates since 2022.\n\nThe average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage fell to 5.99% on Monday, according to the Mortgage News Daily Rate Index.\n\nThe drop ties the lowest level since 2022 and marks a sharp decline from 6.89% a year ago. In late 2023, rates surged to around 8%, the highest level in years.\n\nThe move came after a stock-market sell-off pushed investors into bonds. That lowered Treasury yields and mortgage rates as markets assessed the Supreme Court's Friday ruling on President Donald Trump's use of emergency tariff powers.\n\nLower home borrowing costs are expected to fuel refinancing activity, which has already been gaining momentum.\n\nApplications to refinance a home loan are up roughly 130% from a year ago, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's survey for the week ending February 13.\n\nStill, falling rates have yet to translate into a meaningful pickup in homebuying. Pending home sales declined 0.8% in January from the previous month and slipped 0.4% year over year, according to the National Association of Realtors.\n\n\"Improving affordability conditions have yet to induce more buying activity,\" said Lawrence Yun, the chief economist at NAR, earlier this month.\n\nBut with mortgage rates near 6%, roughly 5.5 million additional households now qualify for a loan compared with a year ago, he said.\n\n\"Most newly qualifying households do not act immediately, but based on past experience, about 10% could enter the market—potentially adding roughly 550,000 new homebuyers this year compared with last year,\" Yun added.\n\nBeyond mortgage rates, other affordability pressures may also be easing.\n\nAs Business Insider's James Rodriguez reported last month, median home prices were largely flat toward the end of 2025, and wage growth is expected to outpace price gains this year — potentially improving affordability further.",

    "fullText": "Before Sharon Osbourne, 73, begins her morning beauty ritual, there's something else she must do.\n\n\"The morning routine has to be the news, the world news. I'm, like, addicted to it,\" Osbourne told host Bunnie XO on her \"Dumb Blonde\" podcast. \"I'll check Instagram, check my emails, and then I start with the ice on the face.\"\n\nThe TV personality and wife of Black Sabbath front man Ozzy Osbourne, who died in July, is specific about how she uses ice in her skincare routine.\n\n\"I do the bowl, and then I do it in, you know, in a little baggie, and just keep doing it. And then I do a face mask, and then I start the day,\" she said.\n\nOsbourne is equally meticulous about her hair, refreshing her signature red shade \"every 10 days.\"\n\nBut keeping the bold color vibrant isn't easy since it gets \"everywhere,\" she said.\n\n\"It's a nightmare. My neck is red. Everything I wear is red. The pillowcases,\" Osbourne said.\n\nShe added that the closest she ever came to going blonde was getting highlights in the '80s, but red is the shade she keeps coming back to because her mother was a redhead.\n\n\"Of course, you know, it's gray or white or whatever color it is underneath. And I tried doing that, and that was just miserable,\" Osbourne said.\n\n\"I would look at my reflection sometimes, like in a shop window. I'd go, who the fuck is that? It's me. Like, no thanks,\" she said.\n\nOsbourne isn't the only public figure who says reading the news is a nonnegotiable part of their mornings.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai says he starts his day by reading Techmeme, a site that aggregates tech news from across outlets.\n\nMartha Stewart, 84, says she wakes up at around 4:30 a.m. and spends the first part of her morning reading the news and doing puzzles.\n\nPeter Warwick, CEO of Scholastic, says he begins each morning by browsing news sites and checking for updates on his favorite English Premier League team, Arsenal.",

    "fullText": "While software stocks get hammered over fears that AI startups will eat their lunch, an Anthropic executive says the sell-off shows how fast AI has advanced.\n\nAnthropic's head of applied AI, Cat de Jong, oversees a team focused on helping large companies weave Anthropic's AI into their products. At a press briefing with Thomson Reuters on Monday, she said that people inside Anthropic have seen the market sell-off as rational due to the pace of progress.\n\n\"The rate of change is just so incredible, and I think the market is really starting to see this now,\" she said.\n\n\"We're grappling with exponentials, and it's something that humans just aren't really used to having to deal with — how quickly things change. And I think that's actually been why the market has been responding the way that it has been, for us internally.\"\n\nThat said, the sell-off does not account for how Anthropic's work with software companies helps improve their products rather than compete directly with them, de Jong said.\n\n\"We want to build the best models in the world,\" de Jong said. \"But I do really think there's a great relationship between general models and domain-specific applications, and our models help them get better.\"\n\nThe sell-off in software stocks began after Anthropic launched new plugins for legal and other knowledge work traditionally dominated by software companies.\n\nThomson Reuters has been using Anthropic's AI to power some of its latest legal tools. It may have seemed an odd coupling given that Thomson Reuters is one of the highest-profile casualties of the software sell-off, with its stock falling over 30% in the past month, while Anthropic just announced this month it raised $30 billion at a $380 billion valuation — over 10 times Thomson Reuters' market cap.\n\nAt the conference, Thomson Reuters executives were bullish about working with Anthropic and touted closely collaborating with the AI startup to build a \"deep research\" feature inside its legal product, CoCounsel, which generates detailed citation-backed reports.\n\nThe two companies will each create sophisticated AI products that excel at different tasks, said Thomson Reuters' chief product officer, David Wong.\n\nThe idea that AI is winner-takes-all is misplaced, he said.\n\n\"There's so many problems that professionals need help with,\" Wong said.",

Letter's software unites these systems into a single \"command center,\" Akhtar said, displacing other tools and enabling sellers to spend more time interacting with customers.\n\nAlongside announcing the Battery Ventures-led Series B, the company is also rolling out Letter Compass, a new product that provides personalized, deal-specific guidance during sales, including coaching tailored to a specific employee or opportunity and suggestions for messaging and next steps.\n\nAkhtar said Battery approached him and cofounder Armen Forget, the CTO, about funding. He attributed the quick succession of rounds to \"phenomenal traction\" and retention. Y Combinator, Lightbank, Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures, and Stage 2 Capital also participated in the Series B alongside existing investors.\n\nLetter counts customers across 30 countries, including Lenovo, Adobe, Novo Nordisk, and Plaid. It will use the funding to expand product development and grow the team globally — which counts 25 employees — across sales, engineering, and customer success, Akhtar said.\n\nLetter is growing in a crowded field, as stalwarts like Salesforce increasingly incorporate AI features and sales AI startups emerge. Gong analyzes sales interactions, for instance, while Seismic and Highspot, which help train salespeople, have announced plans to merge.\n\nHere's a look at the pitch deck Letter AI used to raise its $40 million Series B.

    "description": "Nearly 9 million student-loan borrowers are in default, and another one in four borrowers is behind on payments, a new report said.",
    "fullText": "Student-loan borrowers are falling behind on payments at record levels.\n\nA new report by left-leaning groups, the Century Foundation and Protect Borrowers, found that nearly 9 million student-loan borrowers — or one out of every five — are in default, which typically occurs after a federal borrower hasn't made a payment for more than 270 days.\n\nAdditionally, the report said that one in four borrowers with a payment due is in delinquency, meaning they're behind on payments, and those borrowers have seen their credit scores decrease by 57 points on average over the first three quarters of 2025. A drop in credit can cause borrowers to lose access to various forms of credit or loans, making it difficult to afford basic necessities, the report said.\n\nThis data follows President Donald Trump's restart of collections for defaulted borrowers in May 2025 after a five-year pause. While the Department of Education announced in January that it was pausing wage garnishments and tax refund seizures for defaulted borrowers, it's unclear when the pause will lift, and more borrowers could be at risk of facing those consequences.\n\nThe report said that the pause is \"welcome\" but \"puts a band-aid on a serious wound.\"\n\n\"Considering the nation's worsening affordability crisis and unprecedented number of borrowers entering default, resuming garnishments would be cruel and economically reckless,\" the report said.\n\nEllen Keast, the Department of Education's press secretary for higher education, attributed the rise in delinquency and defaults to various relief measures that the Biden administration put in place, including the \"on-ramp\" to repayment, during which the department did not report any missed payments to credit agencies.\n\n\"The idea of a sudden increase in delinquencies in student loans is a misnomer — the Trump Administration is once again reporting full and accurate data on student loan repayment instead of extending so-called flexibilities related to a pandemic that ended five years ago,\" Keast said. She added that the department \"will continue to support regular, on-time repayment.\"\n\nThe Department of Education released guidance on February 18, urging institutions to reduce student default rates. The guidance included updated nonpayment rates, which are the percentage of borrowers who entered repayment between January 2020 and May 2024 with federal student loans more than 90 days delinquent. Over 1800 institutions have nonpayment rates at or above 25%, the guidance said.\n\n\"Student borrowers have an obligation to repay their loans, but institutions also share a responsibility to ensure their students are prepared to enter repayment and understand the consequences of nonpayment,\" Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement. \"Institutions cannot benefit from taxpayer dollars while ignoring the fact that a significant share of their students are not well-prepared to repay their loans.\"\n\nThe department's looming repayment changes could make things more difficult for some borrowers. Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation eliminated existing income-driven repayment plans and replaced them with less generous options, meaning borrowers will face longer timelines to loan forgiveness and likely higher monthly payments.\n\nThe department also announced a settlement to eliminate Biden's SAVE plan, which would have allowed for cheaper monthly payments and a shorter timeline to relief. The report said that SAVE borrowers are \"more financially fragile than the average borrower,\" citing data from the Biden administration showing that more than half of them qualified for $0 monthly payments, putting them at greater risk of delinquency and default.\n\nStudent loan borrowers have a few options to get out of default. One option is loan rehabilitation, in which a borrower must contact their servicer and enter an agreement to make nine payments over 10 consecutive months. While wage and benefits garnishment will continue during this time, the default status will be removed from the borrower's credit report once rehabilitation is complete.\n\nAnother option is loan consolidation, in which a borrower can apply to consolidate a defaulted student loan into a federal consolidation loan. After consolidation, the borrower would become eligible for federal benefits, but the default status would remain on the borrower's credit history.",

    "description": "A former legal counsel for TikTok quit her job in 2023 to travel the world on a motorbike, seeking adventure and personal growth with her partner.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on an interview with Nerine Mak, a 33-year-old former senior commercial counsel for TikTok who's traveling the world on a motorbike. It has been edited for length and clarity\n\nI'm the eldest of five children. Our house was full of sibling squabbles, lots of negotiation, and mediation, which is probably why I joined the school debating team. A legal degree was a natural progression.\n\nI moved to Australia for college, then returned to Singapore, where I began working as a legal counsel at Ernst & Young in April 2017.\n\nEighteen months later, I became the regional legal counsel for Sephora. I'd only been there for nine months when, in July 2019, a TikTok recruiter approached me.\n\nI stayed at TikTok until I turned 30, when I quit to travel the world on a motorbike.\n\nI decided to go and meet them for interview practice. I knew TikTok was a social media app, but that was about it. When I found out that ByteDance was a major tech company with educational and B2B products, as well as TikTok, I was seriously impressed.\n\nI interviewed for a legal counsel role that'd support the revenue-generating business in Southeast Asia and Oceania. Within 48 hours, the recruiter called me to say I'd passed the first interview, and my second interview would be the next day.\n\nI started taking the process very seriously.\n\nMy first interview was with the hiring manager, then I was interviewed by three people from different business units, and finally, my last interview was with an HR member.\n\nI was still learning a lot at Sephora and wasn't ready to leave, but the opportunity at TikTok was just so appealing.\n\nWhen I told my parents I was going to work for TikTok, my dad didn't really have that much confidence in the company. Initially, I was nervous about the idea of joining, too, because when I asked about my specific job scope, it was still rather unknown.\n\nI received a welcome pack with backpacks, laptop bags, stickers, and stationery.\n\nAt the time, we were working in a coworking space. In my previous roles at Sephora and EY, we collaborated, but at TikTok, the collabs were more dynamic, frequent, and face-to-face.\n\nMy day-to-day involved more meetings, whereas in my earlier roles, independent work carried greater weight.\n\nEach day, I'd have meetings from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., then I'd still have up to three hours of work left before I finished for the day.\n\nThe most challenging year I had was 2021. One of my projects was to launch the TikTok Shop in Indonesia. It was the first to launch globally, so countries like the UK and the US saw my project as the blueprint.\n\nI burned out at least three times that year. Of course, it was very rewarding once launched and turned out to be very successful. My team grew to 10 lawyers, and we'd have weekly catch-ups on ByteDance's all-in-one platform, Lark.\n\nAt 23, I told myself I'd leave my job by 30 to pursue my own growth and discovery. I knew that traveling the world would give me the kind of life lessons my job couldn't give.\n\nAfter 18 months, I started playing around with the idea of van life. In March 2021, a friend referred me to a mechanic, Haren, whom he knew and who could share some car maintenance tips.\n\nHaren and I started dating and decided to travel together. Within three months, I decided to swap the van for a motorbike, and we agreed to leave our jobs and ride off-road bikes from Singapore to Europe.\n\nI left in November 2023. At first, they tried to talk me out of leaving, but I was transparent about my dream of exploring the world. We made sure we had a solid budget, so we didn't have to worry while traveling.\n\nTwo months before we were about to leave, my father said, \"I've bought a bike and Mummy and I are coming too.\" They decided to ride from Singapore to Germany and meet us on the way.\n\nHaren and I set off on January 20, 2024, at 5:30 a.m. I couldn't sleep the night before. When I woke up, my family prepared a farewell party, and our friends arrived on bikes to ride with us to the border.\n\nMy parents joined us on May 5, 2024, on the border of Laos and China. We traveled through China together and then met up again in Poland to travel through the Baltics before we rode to Norway. They're now back in Singapore.\n\nWe've now ridden off-road from Singapore through China and across Afghanistan.\n\nMy day involves leaving the guest house by 11 a.m., riding for two hours, and going sightseeing during our lunch hour. We usually stop riding just before sunset.\n\nWe try not to be rigid with our plans because a lot of the joy and surprises we get come from interacting with locals. They'll invite us into their homes for dinner or to their farms to ride on their horses.\n\nIt was a very promising role, but I knew I had to do this for myself. One of the biggest lessons I've learned is to be optimistic. Your closest people might have doubts about your plans, but you have to follow your heart.\n\nI've been taking on ad hoc legal work for friends who have small businesses. We plan to travel through February, then park our bikes for the next eight months due to family commitments. I'm also thinking of taking this opportunity to get either full-time or part-time legal work.\n\nI would still like to grow my legal skills. That would be a way to bring in income to fund future journeys as well. The freedom I get on two wheels is my passion and will stick with me for the rest of my life.",

    "description": "Tech giants like IBM and LinkedIn are expanding entry-level programs for engineers amid an evolving job landscape for junior workers.",
    "fullText": "Being new to the job market is never easy. But in a field like software engineering, it can feel especially daunting as AI takes over many tasks that used to belong to entry-level workers.\n\nSome companies have grown cautious about hiring recent graduates as they figure out how AI will reshape their teams. Others, however, are celebrating the new wave of talent.\n\nLeaders at Blackstone and Salesforce have told Business Insider that the entry-level talent pool is particularly strong and stands out with its AI fluency.\n\nHere are seven companies, including major tech firms such as IBM, LinkedIn, and Dropbox, who have increased — or plan to increase — hiring of entry-level developers.\n\nLinkedIn is planning on expanding its entry-level engineering internship program by 40%, compared to the year before, Erin Scruggs, vice president and head of global talent acquisition, told Business Insider.\n\n\"We're working closely with our engineering leaders to keep investing in early-career talent, especially engineers who are AI-native and bring a builder mindset,\" Scruggs said in an email.\n\nThe company said it plans to adjust its hiring mix to \"open up more opportunities\" for the next generation of engineers, while continuing to bring in experienced technical leaders.\n\nIBM is tripling its entry-level hiring in 2026, including in software engineering, according to Nickle LaMoreaux, chief human resources officer at IBM.\n\nAt a recent conference hosted by media and insights company Charter, LaMoreaux said that talent professionals will have to \"rewrite every job,\" and communicate the value of entry-level workers to their business because AI can do many of the jobs that entry-level workers were doing a few years ago.\n\n\"If you're going to convince your business leaders that you need to make this investment because it's an investment for the future, then you need to be able to show: What is the real value these individuals can bring now?\" she said.\n\nSoftware developers in 2024 or even 2025 would spend 30 to 40 hours a week coding, LaMoreaux said. Now, she said, they do coding and testing with AI assistance — and they're also building new products, gathering client feedback, and talking to marketing teams.\n\n\"I think the companies three to five years from now that are going to be the most successful are those companies that doubled down on entry-level hiring in this environment,\" LaMoreaux said.\n\nThe CEO of IT-services company Cognizant previously told Business Insider that he expects the entry-level hiring space to grow — and now the company is acting on that. The company told Business Insider it's quadrupling its pipeline of entry-level talent with a plan to hire up to 2,000 early-career talent by the end of the year.\n\n\"Cognizant believes early-in-career talent have a competitive edge in this dynamic moment as AI-natives and lifelong learners,\" Kathy Diaz, chief people officer at Cognizant, told Business Insider in an email.\n\nThe company added that it has various workforce development programs to support early-career candidates, including its Fusion Internship program, which is a project-based internship.\n\nCloud cybersecurity firm Cloudflare announced plans in September to hire 1,111 interns in 2026 to \"train the next generation of technology leaders.\" The plan is a significant increase from its formerly 60-person program, and the aim is to provide students with \"hands-on experience and mentorship,\" the company said in its announcement.\n\nThe program \"offers a chance to work on projects and ship updates that directly impact millions of Internet users, from securing network infrastructure to developing cutting-edge server-less applications,\" the company said.\n\nCloudflare said it would also make developer tools available to US university students at no cost for a year.\n\nThe move comes after the company noted that entry-level technical opportunities have declined across the industry.\n\n\"Without hiring emerging talent, industries risk a critical shortage of experienced workers in the future,\" the company said.\n\nDropbox said it's expanding its internship and new-graduate programs by 25% to capitalize on younger workers' AI fluency. That includes engineering hires, the company told Business Insider.\n\nMelanie Rosenwasser, chief people officer at Dropbox, said that when it comes to entry-level workers using AI, \"it's like they're biking in the Tour de France, and the rest of us still have training wheels,\" Bloomberg reported.\n\nCybersecurity firm ThreatLocker said it plans to nearly double its headcount to 1,200 employees over the next 18 months. The company said a significant number of those hires will be entry-level, expanding its talent pool of junior developers.\n\nThe CEO and cofounder, Danny Jenkins, said in a statement to Business Insider that it maintains a highly demanding training standard for engineers at every level to \"reflect the real pressure of defending critical systems.\" The company has experienced a spike in growth as it responds to a new age of threats in the AI era, the CEO previously told Business Insider.\n\nThe company also offers a free, in-person, 60-hour cybersecurity bootcamp to immerse college students and recent grads in \"live fire\" training scenarios.\n\nInvisible Technologies, an AI software platform for businesses, said it has hired 160 engineers in the past 18 months. Roughly half of them were entry-level or \"quite junior,\" a company spokesperson said.\n\nThe CEO, Matt Fitzpatrick, told Business Insider that he has found entry-level engineers to be \"some of the most thoughtful about using gen AI, because they've grown up using this in their schooling.\" He said the entry-level talent pool is \"incredibly proficient\" and \"more useful than ever.\"",

    "description": "Economist Mark Zandi warns that the market is being driven by speculation and a disconnect from the broader economy.",
    "fullText": "The stock market is wavering this year as investors fret over everything from tariffs to AI, but Mark Zandi thinks things could soon get a lot worse.\n\nThe top economist at Moody's Analytics, Zandi's takes are often more focused on the broader economy than the stock market. However, he said that recent events compelled him to offer a warning on where the US may be headed if certain conditions persist.\n\n\"There are times when I feel markets are overdone and increasingly disconnected from the economy,\" Zandi added. \"Markets risk moving in a big way, causality is reversed, and falling asset prices threaten an already vulnerable economy. This is one of those times.\"\n\nZandi sees a dangerous shift taking place that's putting many assets at risk of a meaningful sell-off that could be a threat to Main Street as well as Wall Street.\n\n\"Valuations are high\" he wrote in an X thread. \"There are good fundamental reasons for this, but markets appear increasingly tainted by speculation. That is, investors are simply investing on the faith that prices will rise quickly in the future because they have in the recent past.\"\n\nThe economist highlighted that he doesn't think the risk is constrained to popular risk assets. Safe-haven assets such as gold and silver, which have benefited significantly from high geopolitical uncertainty in 2025, could also be at risk. He also included crypto in that category, implying that he sees risk beyond the current market pullback.\n\nZandi's analysis focused on the mixed nature of the US economy, a topic that he has repeatedly raised concerns about. The January jobs report was stronger than expected, but Zandi remains unconvinced that it will spur growth.\n\n\"Real GDP is the strongest indicator, and it is growing just over 2%, below the economy's potential, estimated to be near 2.5%,\" he said. \"Employment has flat-lined, and unemployment continues to creep higher. Inflation, as measured by the Fed's preferred consumer expenditure deflator, remains stubbornly and uncomfortably high at 3%.\"\n\nAnother warning sign comes from the Treasury market, generally considered a beacon of stability. Zandi praised the appointment of Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve, but he also has concerns about the institutional buyers who continue to prop up the market.\n\nIf these hedge funds were spooked by fears of an unstable US economy, they could all flee at the same time, sending Treasury prices down and interest rates up. That type of scenario would make lending more expensive, making it difficult for borrowers to get mortgages and business loans.",

    "fullText": "AI has thrown a wrench into various pockets of the stock market this year. An investment chief says it also has the potential to cause problems in the debt market.\n\nOver the last few weeks, AI updates from Anthropic and other firms have threatened business models in numerous industries, but perhaps none more than software. Publicly traded software firms have seen their share prices decline sharply, and private companies have delayed IPOs after seeing valuations fall.\n\nThe rout has created concerns that some firms won't be able to service their debt. Shares of Blue Owl Capital, a private credit firm, are the latest flashpoint for these fears. Its stock is down 32% year to date and has dropped more than 16% over the last week alone after it halted withdrawals from a private debt fund.\n\n\"The concern is there's a lot of lax underwriting that has been taking place, particularly in the software community,\" said Ben McMillan, the chief investment officer at IDX Advisors.\n\n\"They haven't gone to the public markets to get bonds because they probably wouldn't have gotten them,\" he continued. \"So they've been going to the private market getting loans, and now with the AI SAAS apocalypse, and just general concerns about AI profitability, that's starting to reprice.\"\n\nIn the private credit space, leveraged loans get packaged into collateralized loan obligations and sold to investors. While rising risks in the debt market might not directly affect retail investors, they could start to hurt pension funds and endowments with exposure to CLOs and private credit, McMillan said, as they tend to be more reliant on fixed income.\n\nFor now, there's little risk of contagion in the broader economy, he said.\n\n\"This is not a contagion high-yield bond issue,\" McMillan said. \"In fact, if anything, quality high yield, given the soft landing narrative increasing, is doing very well, actually.\"\n\n\"For the everyday investor, this probably isn't something I'd stay up at night worrying about,\" he continued. \"A lot of these institutional investors that loaded up the boat on private credit, they're gonna have their reckoning.\"\n\nPrivate credit has generated a lot of headlines in recent years amid its rapid growth, as well as a push to make the asset class more accessible to everyday investors. While risks in the space are being flagged more often, anxiety in private credit has been at a fever pitch lately. Former PIMCO CEO Mohamed El-Erian drew parallels between Blue Owl's move to halt redemptions on one of its funds to the start of the financial crisis, when BNP Paribas froze withdrawals for some investment vehicles.\n\n\"I think that's kind of the canary in the coal mine now,\" McMillan said. \"It's like, all right, the private credit apocalypse might actually be here.\"",

    "title": "A buzzy data center startup calls itself a utility. That could be a problem.",
    "description": "Fermi American has pitched itself as cutting-edge utility. But its corporate structure puts strict limits on its income sources.",
    "fullText": "At a Wall Street conference in December, Toby Neugebauer, the CEO of Fermi America, pitched his company as a cutting-edge utility built to power the artificial intelligence boom.\n\n\"We're one of the most sophisticated utilities on the planet,\" Neugebauer told an audience of UBS clients. \"There will not be a more sophisticated utility. When you look at redundancy, when you look at technology, there won't be another one.\"\n\nThere's just one problem. Fermi America has a specialized corporate structure that limits its income sources. And selling power isn't one of them.\n\nMore specifically, it's a real estate investment trust, or REIT. Under IRS rules, REITs have to earn most of their money from things like rent, dividends, or mortgage interest. They pass on most of their earnings to shareholders as dividends and don't have to pay corporate income tax.\n\nIf a REIT runs afoul of those guidelines, it can be a big deal.\n\n\"Public statements describing the company as an 'operating company' or 'utility' can be scrutinized if they contradict how income and assets are classified for REIT purposes,\" Jussi Askola, the founder of Leonberg Capital, told Business Insider. \"Substance matters more than labels, but careless language increases risk.\"\n\nThe company has said in filings that selling power could put its REIT status at risk. It plans to make sure the power sales stay within limits and keep the power business in separate units.\n\nREIT status isn't something a company applies for or receives in advance; it elects for treatment as a REIT when it files its tax return. It's up to the IRS to accept that position or challenge it later. (The agency told Business Insider it doesn't comment on specific companies.)\n\nIf Fermi were to lose its REIT status, the consequences for investors could be significant. The company would be taxed as a regular corporation, reducing distributions and potentially causing the stock price to dip. It would also be barred from re-electing REIT status for four years following disqualification, according to Fermi's filings.\n\n\"Such an outcome could materially and adversely affect our valuation, dividend expectations, and access to capital,\" the company wrote in a September IPO filing.\n\nFermi is one of many startups racing to cash in on the AI-driven data center boom. With what it's calling Project Matador, the company is betting it can profit by supplying power directly to those facilities. It plans to generate electricity behind the meter, bypassing the grid, in what remains a largely unproven strategy with uncertain returns.\n\nMore broadly, the scramble to find the next big AI investment has created an opening for financial engineering alongside technological innovation. Companies like Fermi aren't just pitching power; they're pitching a financial structure. And while the appeal of tax-advantaged returns with exposure to the market's hottest themes may attract investors, it also carries a high degree of risk.\n\n\"Fermi America's sophisticated REIT structure was intentionally designed for foreign investment, given that Fermi is a global company with international business partners and suppliers,\" Lexi Swearingen, a spokesperson for the company, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Real estate is all about location, location, location — and Project Matador is blessed to sit on one of the most premier sites in the country,\" she said, \"where we will rent access to power to the world's leading companies.\"\n\nShe later clarified that the company would \"rent access to power-ready real estate.\"\n\nFermi, which counts former Energy Secretary Rick Perry among its directors, went public in September, promising to build 11 gigawatts of electricity in West Texas to supply the data centers behind the AI boom. It pitched investors on a REIT structure, a tax-advantaged investment that often attracts shareholders with lower risk tolerance.\n\nIn general, Askola said, \"most REITs are still considered safer than your average stock.\"\n\nDespite Fermi's pitch, analysts have struggled to pin it down. Macquarie, which acts as both a lender and research firm covering Fermi, groups it with other REITs. In its first note, the firm compared Fermi to data center REITs, but it also included a table with eight publicly traded utilities, suggesting Fermi could also be compared to those companies.\n\nAt Evercore ISI, the company appears to be the only REIT covered by Nick Amicucci, the head of power, utility, and clean energy research. He wrote in the firm's first report that \"while we would expect Fermi to be more comparable to some of the more traditional data center REITs over time,\" during its early buildout, \"comparing it to independent power producers is the most practical and prudent approach.\"\n\nAmicucci told Business Insider that his analysis rested on the idea that it would be years before Fermi would generate the income needed to act like a traditional REIT. \"There is still a massive buildout to go before they say they are going to be issuing a dividend,\" he said.\n\nFermi plans to ringfence its power-generating assets inside special entities known as taxable REIT subsidiaries. Those subsidiaries can account for only 25% of the REIT's total assets. Coupled with the income limits, the challenge will be keeping power sales within those subsidiaries low enough to maintain REIT status.\n\nThe company ultimately plans to sell power generated from natural gas, grid supply, and solar and nuclear sources, while also building and leasing more than 15 million square feet of data center facilities.\n\nIt hasn't disclosed what percentage of projected revenue will come from electricity sales versus rent, nor how much of that activity will occur inside taxable REIT subsidiaries.\n\n\"We view Fermi's structure as complex but durable, provided operational discipline and disclosure remain high,\" Evercore wrote. The use of the subsidiaries, the analysts wrote, \"to contain energy sales risk, combined with long-term lease arrangements that tie power delivery to real property, supports the durability of qualifying income.\"\n\nIn its securities filings, Fermi has openly acknowledged the risk its power business could pose to its REIT classification.\n\n\"Our strategy involves developing power generation assets,\" Fermi wrote, describing subsidiaries that \"may sell power directly to tenants or third parties or engage in other activities that generate non-qualifying income for REIT purposes, that generate net income subject to the tax on prohibited transactions, or that are otherwise incompatible with REIT status.\"\n\nElsewhere, it added \"given our evolving mix of real estate leases and energy service revenue, we may not meet these thresholds in all periods.\"\n\nThe power plan isn't just theoretical. Under a lease with the Texas Tech University System, on whose land Fermi is building its facilities, the company will provide nuclear power to a Texas Tech research campus and data center \"at cost.\" The lease also says that Fermi will pay Texas Tech University System 1% per quarter on any of the power it sells.\n\nFermi has also said it may join either the Southwest Power Pool or the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, two regional grid operators.\n\nStill, Haynes and Boone LLP, Fermi's Dallas-based lawyers, issued a letter included in the IPO filing stating that it believes Fermi qualifies as a REIT.\n\n\"The company has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust,\" the law firm wrote, adding \"its current and proposed method of operation will enable it to continue to meet the requirements.\"\n\nThe letter includes caveats, noting the law firm cannot be expected to oversee the company's operating activities, its means of generating income, or asset mix in ways that may or may not violate the rules around REITs.\n\n\"Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of the Company's operations for any one taxable year will satisfy the requirements for taxation as a REIT under the code.\"\n\nShould its REIT classification get challenged, the business could suffer.\n\nScott Robinson, director of the REIT Center at NYU's Schack Institute of Real Estate, said investors would likely demand a lower stock price to protect themselves.\n\nIn December 2023, Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure Capital, Inc. announced that it would convert from a REIT to a corporation the following January, saying that \"most of our recent investments and pipeline are non-REIT qualifying,\" and that remaining a REIT \"may create misperceptions regarding the company and its exposure to real estate risk.\" In the first three weeks after converting from a REIT to a corporation, the stock declined almost 20%.\n\nRobinson said REIT risk would make him leery of Fermi stock.\"I would probably want to buy that stock at a discount to account for that uncertain economic outcome if they don't get their REIT ruling,\" he said.\n\nMuch of the downside reflects a potential shakeup in investors: income-focused investors drawn to the reliable REIT dividends could exit, pushing down the stock price. If the company is fortunate, they would eventually be replaced by investors more interested in growth and willing to forgo the tax advantages, and the constraints, of the REIT structure.\n\nWhen Neugebauer spoke, in early December, the stock was trading around $15 or $16, below its IPO price of $21. It's now trading around $9.\n\nNeugebauer may have understood the tension.\n\nAfter touting Fermi's utility bona fides at the UBS conference, he went quiet. \"I'm trying to make sure I don't get in trouble,\" he said. \"I'm known to share. Over-share.\"\n\nAre you affiliated with Fermi America, one of its contractors, or otherwise familiar with the company's project?

    "description": "The gap between Russia and the West has pushed Moscow to prioritize unconventional capabilities, a top Norwegian military official said.",
    "fullText": "Russia is betting on its submarines and experimental nuclear weapons to make up for the smaller military force that it fields compared to NATO, a top Norwegian military official told Business Insider.\n\nThat \"inherent asymmetry\" between the Russian armed forces and the militaries of the 32-member NATO alliance, which enjoys far greater conventional strength, has pushed Moscow to prioritize more unconventional capabilities, said Vice Adm. Rune Andersen, chief of the Norwegian Joint Headquarters.\n\n\"It's a wide set of challenges that we are up against,\" he said in an interview last week.\n\nRussia, estimated to have over 1.1 million active-duty troops, less than the US alone with 1.3 million troops, is suffering heavy losses in Ukraine that can't easily be replenished. British intelligence said Moscow has suffered 1.2 million casualties in the war. Western estimates say it's barely breaking even on adding new troops to its ranks.\n\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said 65,000 soldiers were killed across December and January, and US assessments put Moscow's recruitment numbers at 30,000-40,000 a month. Rutte has said that these losses aren't sustainable.\n\nRussian equipment losses have been staggering as well. Ukraine has damaged or destroyed dozens of warships, hundreds of aircraft, and thousands of armored vehicles.\n\nWhile Russia falls short of NATO's conventional strength, especially considering its ongoing losses in Ukraine, alliance military leaders still view Moscow as a threat, particularly its asymmetric capabilities. One such area is its submarine force, Andersen said.\n\nRussia has one of the world's largest submarine fleets, with over 60 boats, some of which are capable of launching ballistic and nuclear-tipped missiles.\n\nAndersen said that Russia can't compete with NATO's integrated surface fleet, equipped with advanced warships and aircraft carriers, so the country is prioritizing underwater capabilities as a way to gain an advantage over the West.\n\n\"Submarines are inherently asymmetric. Underwater is the last place on earth where you can hide,\" Andersen said, adding that NATO forces are highly focused on ensuring that they can secure control of the sub-surface domain.\n\nCmdr. Arlo Abrahamson, a spokesperson for NATO's Allied Maritime Command, told Business Insider that Russia regularly deploys submarines to the Arctic and High North.\n\nHe said that NATO closely tracks this activity; 14 member states operate their own submarines, and the alliance is collectively focused on strengthening its anti-submarine capabilities.\n\nHowever, while NATO \"has significant and broad capabilities with submarines,\" Abrahamson stressed that \"we don't underestimate the capabilities of our adversaries.\"\n\nRussia is also developing weapons systems, some of which are tested in the Arctic, as part of its investments in asymmetric warfare. Two experimental munitions that Andersen identified in the interview are a cruise missile and a nuclear torpedo.\n\nRussian officials disclosed in October that Moscow had tested its nuclear-powered 9M730 Burevestnik cruise missile and autonomous Poseidon torpedo, both of which are intended as second-strike capabilities.\n\nRussia said the Burevestnik, which NATO identifies as the SSC-X-9 Skyfall, flew 8,700 miles and traveled in the air for 15 hours, while the Poseidon launched from a submarine using a boost motor and activated its nuclear power unit to propel it forward.\n\nThe weapons are two of six experimental \"super weapons\" that were unveiled in 2018 by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Moscow has touted the missile and torpedo as being unlimited in range and able to bypass defenses.\n\nThe other weapons in the mix include the Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile, the Zircon ship-launched hypersonic cruise missile, the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle, and the Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile. All are able to carry a nuclear warhead.\n\nSome of these weapons have already been used against Ukraine, frequently not living up to the hype. However, their development represents continued investment in Moscow's nuclear capabilities.\n\n\"You could argue, given that Russia is conventionally bogged down in Ukraine and might come out weakened after the war in Ukraine, that the nuclear weapons are relatively more important to Russia as the core element of any big power ambitions they might have,\" Andersen said.",

    "description": "A cardiac surgeon thought he was in great shape. After a surprising heart attack, he noticed subtle risk factors in his routine and made changes.",
    "fullText": "Dr. Jeremy London was miles from home, out in the dark Georgia woods on a hunting trek with his teenage son when he was hit with a crushing chest pain.\n\nHe hadn't been feeling well that day, suffering from what he told his wife — and himself — was heartburn. That morning, when the couple went to take their dogs for a walk, he started pouring sweat, despite the chill in the December air. The symptoms came and went, easing when he sat down, and starting up again when he got moving.\n\nThese were textbook signs of a heart blockage, something London knew well from his daily work as a cardiac surgeon.\n\n\"I went, 'Oh shit.' I knew what it was. Symptoms brought on with exertion, relieved with rest is coronary angina until proven otherwise. That's what I do every day,\" London told Business Insider.\n\nHe couldn't quite believe it was happening to him.\n\nLondon was, on the surface, doing everything right: eating well (his wife is a holistic nutritionist) and exercising often while training for triathlons and practicing jiu-jitsu.\n\nBut out in the field with his son that night, as the woods darkened to pitch black and London fell to his knees with the pain, he couldn't brush it off as heartburn. It was clear he was having a heart attack.\n\nWhen he made it to the ER, doctors found a 99% blockage of blood flow in his right artery.\n\nThat was in 2022. Now 59 years old, London said his personal experience highlights how easy it is to put off your health or ignore red flags, even as an expert — and how a few simple changes can make all the difference.\n\n\"The bottom line is, many, many times we know better and we don't do better. It is a universal human trap, and none of us are immune,\" he said. \"I mean, who would know better than me?\"\n\nAs London recovered from his heart attack, he was forced to be brutally honest about his health. He was great at exercising, but skimped on other healthy habits in pursuit of his busy career and active lifestyle.\n\n\"The most important thing for you is the thing you're bad at,\" London said. \"For me, that's sleep.\"\n\nAfter decades of working long hours and staying on call as a doctor, his ability to rest and relax was a mess.\n\nStep one was working on his sleep hygiene, managing his stress, and improving his overall recovery.\n\nBut as London took a closer look at his health, he realized other habits weren't as healthy as he thought. For instance, he was shocked to find that he was pre-diabetic after trying a continuous glucose monitor on a whim.\n\nTo manage blood sugar, he started taking a short walk after eating, taking more movement breaks during the day, and including fiber and protein at each meal.\n\nHe also hydrates consistently, drinking water first thing in the morning and keeping a bottle with him so he can sip throughout the day.\n\nDehydration can exacerbate stress on the heart and worsen mental and physical performance. London is an official partner of the water filter brand Rorra and uses their countertop filter daily to reduce exposure to environmental contaminants like PFAS, which have been linked to health issues.\n\n\"With my busy schedule and operations that can last hours at a time, it's easy for my hydration to take a back seat,\" he said. \"Though it's far from perfect, I try to hydrate proactively.\"\n\nRealizing how he had fallen short in caring for his health — and all the warning signs of heart problems he missed — was a humbling experience, but also an opportunity, according to London.\n\n\"The key is that you recognize it, you learn from that, and you're a better person at taking care of yourself and consequently everyone around you as a result of making those mistakes,\" he said.\n\nLondon said most people don't realize that heart disease, not cancer, is the leading cause of death for American adults.\n\nWhile factors like age, genetics, and environment play a role in heart health, the best way to protect yourself is to understand metrics that matter, such as:\n\nOnce you've checked your baseline heart health and understand how it compares to normal ranges for your age group, it's easier to get the most bang for your buck in forming healthier habits.\n\n\"There are some really simple, although not easy ways to move the needle, to protect yourself from cardiac events or to then reset yourself if those things have already happened,\" London said.",

There were long lines to de-ice planes, while runways were periodically closed at short notice to clear the heavy snowfall, the airport said.\n\nMunich, Europe's 10th-busiest airport, typically shuts at midnight, but it received a permit that day to operate an hour later.\n\nWhen the six flights couldn't depart on time, there was no space left to park at the terminal due to all the cancellations, the airport said.\n\nHowever, the passengers couldn't be transported to the terminal because \"bus service was severely restricted\" due to \"the late hour and communication problems,\" it added.\n\nFive of the flights were operated by Germany's Lufthansa Group, and another by Air Arabia, a budget airline based in the UAE, according to the airport.\n\nIt said that airlines \"provided the passengers with the best possible care on the aircraft.\" Although those on board spoke of their distress.\n\n\"There was no food or drink for us. There were no blankets for us either,\" Søren Thieme, who was on one of the Lufthansa planes, told Ekstra Bladet, a Danish newspaper that first reported the incident.\n\nHe said passengers on the canceled flight to Copenhagen asked if they could enter the airport, but they were told it was forbidden, and that all the bus drivers had gone home.\n\n\"We're simply trapped here, along with the staff, too,\" he told the newspaper.\n\nLufthansa and Air Arabia did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.\n\nMunich Airport said it \"apologized expressly\" to the affected passengers.\n\n\"Our top priority is always the safety and satisfaction of our passengers, and these incidents do not meet our standards.\"",

    "fullText": "The blizzard hammering the East Coast might have you dreaming of a beach paradise. The reality could be a nightmare.\n\nLocals and tourists in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, are dealing with ongoing violence after the killing of a Mexican cartel boss.\n\nLocated on Mexico's Pacific coast in Jalisco, Puerto Vallarta isn't some off-the-beaten-path spot for adventurous vacationers. It's a mainstream tourist destination that also has its fair share of American retirees.\n\nThese photos show the destruction and chaos that have taken place across Mexico. Satellite images also show the seriousness and extent of the violence, including fires, roadblocks, and burning cars.\n\nAnd problems weren't contained to Mexico. Dozens of flights were forced to divert as a result. Check out our map on the flight disruptions here.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said there is \"peace, security and normalcy\" across the country. However, on Monday afternoon, the US Embassy and consulates in Mexico issued a shelter-in-place order for US citizens in Jalisco, Baja California, Nayarit, and some other areas across the country\n\nThe chaos in Puerto Vallarta isn't just affecting US citizens in town for a beachside vacation.\n\nPlenty of Americans have put down more permanent roots in the coastal city thanks to its low cost of living, which has also made it a hot spot for retirees.\n\nSome Americans BI spoke to aren't going anywhere. Steve Polito, 49, who splits his time between New York and Puerto Vallarta, said he wants to stay to support the local community.\n\n\"I've experienced it firsthand and that's what keeps it going. People persevere here,\" he said.\n\nLinda Armijo, 70, has been a regular visitor to Puerto Vallarta for 25 years. She's in the middle of a three-month stay and still feels safe in the city. She is most concerned about the locals missing out on their wages due to the shutdown.\n\n\"It's a minor inconvenience not being able to leave, but my biggest emotions are sadness and concern for the people of Puerto Vallarta,\" she said.\n\nIt's unclear if others will stay as committed to Puerto Vallarta as Polito and Armijo. BI spoke to one couple who cancelled an upcoming trip and is unsure whether they'll try visiting later.\n\nThe economic savings from living outside the US might be too good to pass up.\n\nThat's especially true for the millions of Americans struggling with retirement security, which sometimes means working into their 80s.",

    "description": "The US has controlled the air in its recent conflicts, but the war in Ukraine shows that may not be the case in the future.",
    "fullText": "Learning from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, US Army drone trainers are teaching soldiers to be ready for a threat many US troops haven't faced in decades: a sky they don't control.\n\nThe US has had control of the air in its recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, allowing it to move and strike with relatively little fear of enemy aircraft. For most soldiers, what's overhead has usually been friendly.\n\nBut the war in Ukraine is showing the US and Western allies that this assumption may not hold in future conflicts. That shift has implications for tactics, training, and even mindset.\n\nMaj. Rachel Martin, the director of the Army's new Unmanned Advanced Lethality Course designed to catch the US up on small drone warfare, told Business Insider that \"we are used to air supremacy as an Army.\"\n\n\"Just about every event we've ever been a part of, we own the air.\" Ukraine is demonstrating \"that may not be the case.\"\n\nNeither Russia nor Ukraine has been able to secure lasting air superiority, as both sides have powerful air defense arsenals. That mutual denial has constrained traditional airpower and contributed to a grinding war in which drones, artillery, and air defenses dominate the fight. Officials across NATO have warned that Western militaries cannot assume that they'll have air superiority in future conflicts.\n\nFor individual soldiers, that reality changes both tactics and psychology. The Army's drone course is trying to prepare them.\n\n\"In an environment where we may not have air supremacy,\" Martin said, \"we need to teach and ingrain in every soldier to be pessimistic or suspicious\" of anything in the air.\n\nIt has to be an almost reflexive judgment — there isn't time to work through it step by step.\n\nAs she put it, \"by the time you make that mental process and decide\" whether a drone is friendly, \"it may have already targeted you.\" In these fights, \"you hear the sounds, and then you're engaged.\"\n\nShe said that Ukrainians, whether they are soldiers or civilians, already have this mindset.\n\n\"When they hear the sound of a drone, they immediately deploy a cover, they jump into a house or hide under a bunker, and they don't even wait around to find out if it's theirs or not,\" she said. \"They just assume that it's there to hurt them.\"\n\nThat mindset shift is \"something that we're trying\" to build into the training, Martin said.\n\nUS veterans with experience in Ukraine have spoken about how different the experience is compared to recent US conflicts, particularly the constant presence of enemy drones and artillery.\n\nCarl Larson, an Iraq veteran who was born in Seattle and served in Ukraine's International Legion, said drones are \"a horrendous detriment to morale\" because they mean soldiers often can't move out of their bunkers or other positions during the day.\n\nThat is \"incredibly corrosive to your ability to conduct combat operations,\" and also causes immense stress, he said.\n\nDrones can inflict sudden, unpredictable losses. He said he lost \"good friends\" in Ukraine who \"died from having a grenade explode next to them out of nowhere, under a blue sky, you couldn't even hear it. Bang, they're dead.\"\n\nA veteran of urban warfare in Afghanistan and Iraq who served in Ukraine with the call sign Jackie previously told Business Insider that, compared to those conflicts, there was nowhere for soldiers to really relax in Ukraine. In those, there was space to breathe for soldiers when they moved back half a mile from the line of contact. \"You could stand outside and have a barbecue, a sandwich, and drink.\"\n\nThat wasn't the case when he fought in the city of Bakhmut, one of the most brutal battles of the war. There were so many drones and artillery that you couldn't even tell where the line of contact was.\n\nThe result was soldiers hiding all day and not moving for hours, in case they were spotted by drones, making the place look like \"a ghost town.\"\n\n\"You would be spotted immediately by a drone because there's hundreds of drones in the air. There's no place that's safe.\" Soldiers couldn't recharge and reequip themselves, as he had been used to with the US Army.\n\nMartin said the Army's drone course is, in response, teaching students that \"we won't be in a battlefield that remains as static as we're used to.\" It's teaching students that \"mobility is survivability\" and that \"you may need to move before you're observed in order to survive.\"",

He's going particularly well and [against England] he was brilliant,\" Ringrose said.\n\n\"It's kind of the off-the-pitch or outside of the 80 minutes, we are working hard as a centres group, as a unit to try and get things right, be adaptable as to who's in there and all be on the same page, while also then bringing that kind of uniqueness and individual quality.\n\n\"We're all buying into the collective and he's properly delivering on bringing his uniqueness and individual strengths which has been evident the last few games.\"\n\nAfter back-to-back victories over Italy and England propelled Ireland back into championship contention, Andy Farrell's side have a fallow week before they host struggling Wales in Dublin on Friday, 6 March.\n\nWhile the Welsh have lost their last 13 Six Nations games, Ringrose is wary of the threat they posed in their narrow defeat against Scotland and how quickly fortunes can change in the championship if Ireland do not prepare well.\n\n\"That's the challenge and it's the beauty of the Six Nations. Even talking to the England lads how quick things can shift in two weeks,\" he added.\n\n\"We were in a tough spot after losing to France, they [England] were in a great spot after continuing their winning ways against Wales and in two weeks the different things shift.\n\n\"So, that's the challenge to probably front up and try and put in a performance.\n\n\"It's our preparation, so that'll be the focus for the next two weeks.\"\n\nIreland's Lowe a doubt for Wales with groin injury\n\nIreland potential 'huge' after record win - Farrell\n\nFive talking points from round three of Six Nations",

    "fullText": "Mason Jones says he wants to \"show how well he can perform in front of a home crowd\" when he takes on Frenchman Axel Sola in London on Saturday, 21 March.\n\nThe Welshman was beaten by unanimous decision by Ludovit Klein at the O2 Arena in July 2023, his most recent defeat.\n\nJones returned to Cage Warriors, winning four fights in a row before signing a new deal with the UFC in February 2025.\n\nGoing into the third fight of his second UFC deal 'The Dragon' has a chance to banish the demons from that night on which Jones admits he did \"everything wrong\".\n\nJones told BBC Sport Wales: \"I fought a tough guy and made so many mistakes. I'm super excited to go there and reframe it and show that London is a homecoming for me.\"\n\nThe 30-year-old is excited to fight on home soil after bouts in the United States and France in his past two outings in the UFC.\n\n\"It's going to be a massive change for me,\" he said.\n\n\"I fought a Des Moines local in Des Moines, so I was massively away there, then fought a Belgian guy in Paris.\n\n\"It'll be nice to hear the crowd for me for a change.\"\n\nJones is hopeful that a win will push him into contention for a top 15 opponent in the lightweight rankings.\n\n\"When I signed back to the UFC, I said three foundational fights, to secure my footings in the UFC, then I'll get a top 15.\n\n\"If I beat Axel Sola on March 21, I'll be calling for a top 15 opponent.\n\n\"If I don't get one, I'll get an eliminator for the top 15.\"\n\nJones said it is a prospect the UFC have mentioned in passing.\n\n\"They're interested in seeing me touch that top 15,\" he added.\n\n\"I'm happy to win points, to outpoint him for three five-minute rounds.\n\n\"I'm always looking to finish with the excitement of putting him away, but if I can outpoint him I will.\n\n\"If I finish him, they'll offer me a top 15 fight next fight.\"\n\nShould Jones earn a spot in the top 15, he would become only the second Welshman to be ranked in the UFC, following in Jack Shore's footsteps when he beat Timur Valiev in March 2022.\n\nStanding in Jones' way is Sola, who defeated Northern Ireland's Rhys McKee in Paris in September, the same night as Jones' triumph over Oki.\n\nThe Blaenavon native is wary of the threat posed by his opponent.\n\n\"Sola is a 6ft 2in (188cm) southpaw, very big and strong.\n\n\"He started his career at welterweight, moved back to lightweight and he's had one win in the UFC.\n\nJones sees the Frenchman as a \"super exciting\" opponent.\n\n\"He's long, he's rangy, he's powerful, a very dangerous striker and wrestler.\n\n\"We've worked on lots of specifics, I've been doing training camps in lots of different places.\n\n\"I've been working specifically with southpaws for this camp, which means working with some of the youngsters coming through.\"\n\nOne of those who Jones has been working with is unbeaten boxer Kyran Jones who boasts a professional record of 13 wins.\n\nThe Welshman could feature on the bill in Cardiff on 4 April, when Lauren Price defends her WBA, WBC, IBF, IBO and Ring Magazine World welterweight titles against Stephanie Pineiro Aquino.\n\nIn terms of his fighting mentality, Jones is clear in himself.\n\n\"There's three types of fighters,\" Jones said.\n\n\"Martial artists, the traditional who loves the spirit of it, my partner back home is that type.\n\n\"Then there's the athlete who can just do it and perform, the Jon Jones type.\n\n\"Then there's the figure who loves the violence. I'm the pure fighter, I'm ready for a fight 24/7.\n\n\"For me it's just getting so that I can perform at 100% and make the finishes look spectacular.\n\n\"One of the quotes I love is 'It takes a lot of violence to be this peaceful'. I'm in it because I love the violence of it.\"\n\nWhen asked if he had a message for himself in a year's time, Jones was bullish about his ambitions.\n\n\"You better be chipping away at the top 10, otherwise we've given up too much to not want to push.\n\n\"I'm getting better all the time, stronger, fitter, I want it more, I'm wiser.\n\n\"Everyone in this game wants it, but not everyone wants to put the work in.\n\n\"I like to tell myself, either decrease what you want or increase how much you're willing to put in because you can't have it both ways.\n\n\"You either have to want less or give more, I'm giving as much as it needs, I'll keep pushing.\"\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Team GB's silver medal-winning curling team say they would \"love\" to go for gold at the 2030 Winter Olympics in France but will \"sit down in the summer\" before making a decision.\n\nBruce Mouat, Grant Hardie, Hammy McMillan and Bobby Lammie, plus alternate Kyle Waddell, arrived in Italy for this year's Games as world champions and favourites, but were beaten by Canada in a tight encounter that ended 9-6.\n\nIt was the rink's second runners-up medal following a loss to Sweden in China four years ago.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, McMillan said competitors in elite sport were \"getting younger\" but added: \"I'm not going to say no. I'd love to be there again in 2030 to try to get that one medal we don't have.\n\n\"Me and Grant are the two oldest in the team at 33 right now, so we'd be 37, which in terms of being a sports person is quite old, but for curling maybe not.\"\n\nIn a separate interview with BBC Breakfast, Hardie explained: \"I think that's why myself and Hammy were quite emotional on the podium. At the age of 33, you don't know if you'll get to another Olympics.\n\n\"One was a dream, two was even better. Two medals from two is amazing.\n\n\"I think we'll sit down in the summer and see what the next four years looks like.\"\n\nHe added: \"It was the same when we sat down four years ago after Beijing. What can we do different? How can we get back an change things?\n\n\"To end up with the same [medal], it's not a wasted four years because it's very special to come home with a silver, [but] it still obviously hurts because you know you wanted the gold.\"\n\nThe team have been together for almost a decade with skipper Mouat, 31, believing their closeness has played a key role in their success on the world stage.\n\n\"We know each personality so well now,\" he said. \"It's quite important you're saying the right thing to each person to get the best out of them.\n\n\"It's things we've worked on with sports psychologists. I think it's all worked in our favour and now we're sitting here with two Olympic medals.\n\n\"It's testament to all the hard work we've put in.\"\n\nMcMillan revealed their personality traits had been among the \"insights\" studied at the outset of putting the rink together.\n\n\"Bruce is that caring person, Grant's the analytical data-driven [one], always thinks before he speaks. I don't,\" said McMillan.\n\n\"I think it's great having four very different characters to help build one team,\" Hardie added.\n\n\"Nine years together working on it, it's something that clicked pretty early and it's went from strength to strength.\"\n\nNot the medal they wanted - but GB curlers bring spotlight to sport\n\nGB curlers denied Olympic gold at death yet again\n\nHow Team GB is leading the way in curling's arms race",

    "title": "I want to show everyone what I can do for Liverpool - Ngumoha",
    "description": "Rio Ngumoha on life at Liverpool, his mindset when he comes off the bench and his discussions with manager Arne Slot.",
    "fullText": "As Liverpool made their way out of the City Ground on Sunday, Rio Ngumoha was keen to talk.\n\nHe may only be 17 but already there are signs that the maturity he has on the pitch relates to his off-pitch behaviour too.\n\nSuch was his impact in Liverpool's win at Nottingham Forest - including playing his part in Alexis Mac Allister's disallowed goal after replacing Mohamed Salah in the 77th minute - that he earned praise all around.\n\n\"Top drawer. Changed the game for them. A winger that wants to beat his man and deliver with a mix of speed and finesse,\" said ex-Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand.\n\nFormer Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge added: \"Every time I watch Ngumoha, he looks electric. Direct, fearless, always trying to affect the game. He deserves more minutes. Simple as that.\"\n\nMore minutes is what Ngumoha desires. Until now, the teenager has been restricted to just 89 minutes in the Premier League despite being in the squad for all the games except one. And he's determined to show everyone his capabilities.\n\nWhen he came on against Forest, was the mindset to make a statement?\n\n\"Yeah, I know I need to at least do something to try to impact the game, whether that's on the ball or off the ball. That can be putting in a tackle, pressing to win the ball back, putting balls in the box, having shots on target or just beating my man,\" said Ngumoha.\n\n\"I just think every single time I'm called on for the team, I want to show everyone what I can do really.\"\n\nWhen Ngumoha scored a dramatic 100th-minute winner at Newcastle in August and became Liverpool's youngest goalscorer, there was a feeling externally that he would be seen more frequently this season.\n\nYet Slot has managed his game-time, with the teenager who Liverpool poached from Chelsea in 2024 only starting in the EFL Cup and FA Cup so far.\n\nWhen Luis Diaz left for Bayern Munich last summer, Liverpool opted to create a pathway for Ngumoha rather than going for Bradley Barcola or Malick Fofana.\n\nGiven the recent struggles of Cody Gakpo, who has played more minutes than any Liverpool forward this season, Ngumoha perhaps deserves a chance down his preferred left flank.\n\nDown the right, Salah has gone nine Premier League games without a goal, and it was down that side where Ngumoha impressed on Sunday.\n\n\"Hopefully [more game-time] soon, just keep pushing and gaining the manager's trust and hopefully that leads to more minutes,\" insisted Ngumoha, who has continued playing at academy level in recent weeks.\n\nLast weekend, the day after he had a goal wrongly disallowed against Brighton in the FA Cup, Ngumoha scored a screamer against West Brom at U21 level.\n\nHe said: \"I feel like if you are not playing as much then you can stagnate, so I want to gain more minutes - whether that is Under-18s or 21s - I am still so young, so I am available to play, so any games I can play, I will.\"\n\n'Chelsea were angry to lose him' - who is Liverpool's Ngumoha?\n\nThe case from Slot and Liverpool is that there is no doubt about his talent and his ability to take players on but there is precaution given his age.\n\nThe plan is to manage his workload and be \"careful\", as Slot says. Ngumoha has two days of training a week where he is off the pitch.\n\nThere is a focus on building his physicality too and improving his off-ball work for the challenges of the top-flight, be that game understanding or his defensive instincts.\n\nVery few teenagers are equipped technically, physically and mentally to play at the highest level straight away and Liverpool are getting him ready to be a key part of their side for the near future - but are keen not to rush things.\n\n\"The manager is very important to me and he helps me a lot,\" said Ngumoha.\n\n\"We might have a meeting after training and he tells me how well I am doing, to keep going, showing me clips. All of that is important and helpful.\n\n\"I think it has gone really well. I am learning a lot every day playing and training with some of the best players in the world. I can't ask for much more as a young kid. So I just think I need to carry on proving, working hard in training and showing what I can do to the manager.\"\n\nNgumoha has played more games than anyone under the age of 18 by a distance this season. But those 89 minutes would rank him 55th in Premier League history in terms of minutes played before turning 18.\n\nGareth Barry and Wayne Rooney, for context, had more than 2,000 Premier League minutes before turning 18.\n\nRooney himself predicted Ngumoha to be the breakout name in the league this season and the clamour for him to start more is only growing. His time can't be far off now.\n\nAt a recent Adidas event in Manchester, Ngumoha named Jeremy Doku, Noni Madueke and Salah as the three wingers he loves to watch. Three players who have a reputation for taking on their man.\n\n\"If the opportunity is there to take on the man, I'll do that any day of the week,\" Ngumoha said on Sunday.\n\nThe way he played and the way he spoke, he is keen to do that week in, week out for Liverpool.\n\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Former head coach Eddie Jones says the scenes at the end of England's defeat against Ireland on Saturday reminded him of the acrimonious end of his own time in charge at Twickenham.\n\nEngland came into the Six Nations with hopes of winning a first title since 2020, but their campaign has been sunk by emphatic back-to-back defeats after they were overturned by Scotland in round two.\n\nSome home fans left Allianz Stadium early in the Ireland match, while fly-half George Ford was ironically cheered for finding touch after two earlier botched efforts.\n\n\"I felt a bit sick at the end of the game,\" Jones told his Rugby Unity podcast., external\n\n\"I've had that feeling - the grey sky looks like it is coming down on you, there is this eerie feeling in the stadium, it's only half full, and the ones that are there are looking for a bit of blood.\"\n\nJones' own tenure ended with a 27-13 loss to South Africa in November 2022, which concluded to a chorus of jeers.\n\nThe Rugby Football Union sacked the Australian 10 days later after a review into his record of five wins in 12 matches across that calendar year.\n\nFive reasons for England's Six Nations slide\n\nRugby Union Weekly: The weekend review with Warburton & Barclay\n\nFive talking points from round three of Six Nations\n\nJones believes that Steve Borthwick, who worked as his assistant during stints with England and Japan, made an error before the tournament starting in publicly stating his team's aim to travel to Paris on the final weekend with the title in their sights.\n\nThe game had loomed as a meeting of the two pre-tournament favourites, but, while France have collected a maximum 15 points from their three opening fixtures, England could sink to the bottom of the standings if they lose to an impressive Italy in Rome in their next and penultimate match on 7 March.\n\n\"I thought Steve made some very uncharacteristic comments about a title decider against France,\" Japan head coach Jones added.\n\n\"Steve is the most pragmatic, intelligent coach you could meet, but to look ahead for any team is fraught with danger. We all know that.\n\n\"The players read everything, right? Wives read everything, girlfriends read everything, boyfriends read everything.\n\n\"They all read it, right? And they hear that and they talk to them and they say, 'we've got to get our tickets for France, where are we staying, where are we going the night before for dinner?'\n\n\"All that happens, right? And the slight psychological change you can get in a team because of that, they start to look ahead.\"\n\nJones said that the sharp dip in England's performances after a run of 12 successive wins was down to \"emotional control\".\n\n\"That comes down to the preparation for the game, the leadership on the field or one or two players not particularly buying into the team,\" he added.\n\n\"It could be any one of those factors.\"\n\nThe 66-year-old believes the solution lies with England's on and off-field leaders bringing the team together, but also urged Borthwick to reconsider his decision to deploy Henry Pollock from the start.\n\nThe Northampton back row was included in the starting XV for the first time after seven enterprising cameos as a replacement.\n\nWhile Pollock delivered some eye-catching moments, beating five defenders, winning a breakdown turnover, making the sixth-highest number of metres for the hosts and the most tackles of any England back row, Jones believes he makes more impact in short bursts off the bench.\n\n\"Pollock to me is like, if you go back, [former South Africa back row] Bobby Skinstad - good-looking, always got a suntan and he can play,\" said Jones.\n\n\"He's one of those blokes who is 20 minutes, who finds himself in the right position, but he's not a 'grind' player.\n\n\"And to play a full 80 in the back row you have got to be prepared to grind. Maybe that's not the best job for him.\"\n\nThree countries, 25,000 miles - England's daunting summer itinerary\n\nListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - Bloodgate\n\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",

    "description": "It was all withdrawn within weeks.",
    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nIrving Rosenberg spent a lifetime building his savings. At 90, with impaired hearing, limited mobility and early-stage dementia, the Southern California man had no reason to think his $814,000 in savings at Wells Fargo was at risk.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nMost Americans earn a dismal 0.39% APY on their cash at big banks. Unlock up to 4.05% APY and pay $0 in account fees instead with a Wealthfront Cash Account\n\nStarting last April, someone began forging Rosenberg's signature on checks and draining his savings account. He'd never written a single check from it. The withdrawals came fast — many over just a few weeks — and added up to $814,000 (1).\n\nRosenberg didn't catch it. Given his health, he wasn't in a position to. \"I was angry and frustrated,\" he told ABC7 Los Angeles. \"It took all my life savings … I was hurt.\"\n\nWhen Rosenberg realized what had happened, he called Wells Fargo looking for help. The bank opened an investigation, but offered little reassurance. \"An investigation could go forever,\" he said. \"That's what they told me.\"\n\nThen came a letter: Wells Fargo was denying his fraud claim. Too much time had passed before he'd contacted the bank. The bank's deposit agreement gives customers 60 days to report unauthorized transactions. Rosenberg, dealing with dementia, skin cancer, and near-total hearing loss, had missed it.\n\nHis nephew David Satin, who had stepped in to help manage Rosenberg's affairs, was stunned — especially after looking at the cashed checks. \"If you look at all the checks that were written, none of them even have close to his signature, not even remotely close,\" Satin told ABC7.\n\nSatin pushed back with the bank directly. \"I said, 'Wait a second. He's 90. He's got a little bit of dementia. He can't hear. He can barely walk. He's got skin cancer. He's not noticing these kinds of things, and you guys have no help at all for him.'\"\n\nHe also questioned why such massive withdrawals — many clustered in a matter of weeks — were never flagged by Wells Fargo's fraud systems in the first place. But he wasn't getting anywhere. The bank simply wasn't responding.\n\nWith nowhere left to turn, Satin contacted ABC7's consumer advocacy team, 7 On Your Side, and asked for help.",

    "fullText": "The best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry. That was certainly the case for the man-made Osborne Reef of the 1970s, which was meant to boost marine life off Florida's coast but did the opposite.\n\nThe Osborne Reef was created when a nonprofit dropped around two million tires into coastal waters during the 1970s, as Interesting Engineering described.\n\nThe concept was approved by the Army Corps of Engineers and garnered widespread support. Tire manufacturer Goodyear contributed by launching the initiative with a gold-plated tire from the Goodyear Blimp.\n\nThe project backfired because of an array of natural challenges. Tires broke loose during hurricanes and tropical storms as they were secured only by nylon ropes and steel clips.\n\nThose tires damaged nearby coral reefs while failing to provide a proper habitat for coral as intended. The tires also traveled far and wide, creating a costly cleanup situation with hundreds of thousands of tires strewn across the bottom of the ocean.\n\nThe Osborne Reef saga shows that even projects with the right ideas can go very wrong. 4ocean (@4ocean), a company that works to clean up the ocean, illuminated that point in a post to Instagram, highlighting its efforts to clean up the area.\n\n\"Ultimately, the well-intentioned project failed,\" it wrote. \"We definitely have a lot of work to do.\"\n\n4ocean isn't alone in those efforts. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Marine Debris Program launched a reconnaissance project nearly 20 years ago, and there have been other efforts to remove the tires.\n\nThe Florida Department of Environmental Protection provided a summary of the efforts to clean up the tires. In several phases of a pilot project that started in 2007, divers got more efficient at removing the tires.\n\nAs they progressed, they also prioritized the health of coral found on the tires. The project now includes finding a new home for those coral that will give them a better chance of survival before tire removal by divers.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (WHTM) — Governor Josh Shapiro just ordered United States and Commonwealth flags to fly at half-staff next Saturday in honor of Reverend Jesse Jackson, who passed away last week.\n\nAccording to Shapiro, flags on all Commonwealth facilities, public buildings, and grounds across Pennsylvania are ordered to fly at half-staff on Saturday, March 7, until sunset.\n\nThe tribute will coincide with the final day of memorial services scheduled for Rev. Jackson.\n\n“Rev. Jesse Jackson was a civil rights activist and Baptist minister who championed the civil rights movement,” Shapiro’s office explained. “Throughout his life of service, Rev. Jackson made countless visits to Pennsylvania, advocating for labor rights and civil rights across the Commonwealth — from Pittsburgh and Erie to Harrisburg and Philadelphia.”\n\nOne of Rev. Jesse Jackson’s last visits to the Commonwealth was back in October 2024, when he was hosted by the Pennsylvania Legislative Black Caucus.\n\nIn a post on X, Governor Shapiro had said the following:\n\n“Rev. Jesse Jackson was a change maker, a boundary breaker, and a passionate and unrelenting crusader for civil rights, equality and opportunity. To be around him felt like you were experiencing history. It was an honor to share the pulpit with him back in September of 2016 at Sharon Baptist Church in West Philly. I hung on his every word and could feel how much his presence meant to the congregation. Lori and I are praying for his wife Jacqueline, his family, and everyone he inspired over the years. May the memory of Rev. Jesse Jackson be a blessing.”\n\nCivil rights leader Jesse Jackson dies at age 84\n\nRev. Jackson’s family shared that the civil rights leader had passed away on February 17 after battling a neurodegenerative disorder called Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). He was 84 years old.\n\nThis is a developing story. Stay with abc27 News as more information becomes available.",

    "fullText": "President Trump’s top mouthpiece has flipped out over criticism leveled at “Keystone” Kash Patel after the FBI director was busted celebrating with a U.S. Olympic team on the taxpayers’ dime.\n\nPatel, who, on becoming FBI director, said resources would go solely toward fighting crime, was pictured celebrating in Italy with Team USA after its overtime Olympic victory over Team Canada in the men’s hockey final.\n\nThe 45-year-old hockey buff mingled with the players while guzzling beers and beating his chest as if he were part of the team. He even commandeered a gold medal at one point, looping it around his neck. The fallout was spectacular, with many wondering why the embattled crime chief was in party mode while his bureau struggles to find the missing mother of Today host Savannah Guthrie.\n\nThere were also concerns about the nature of the foreign jaunt, given that Patel’s office had insisted it was “strictly” business, according to Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Carol Leonnig.\n\nShe provoked the ire of White House communications director Steven Cheung by posting about the saga on X. “Yes - Multiple sources have sent me and @KDilanianMSNOW this video *appearing to show* @FBIDirectorKash Patel guzzling from a beer and partying in locker room w US men’s hockey team. His office insisted this was strictly a business trip. We at @MSNOWNews will share what we learn,\" she wrote on Sunday evening.\n\nIn the early hours of Monday, a bristling Cheung replied. “Carol, you’re either mentally deficient or a liar,” he began.\n\n“This ‘exclusive’ video your ‘sources’ sent you is actually from a publicly available Instagram story. Second, Kash was also in Italy meeting with regional partners and security teams. Third, don’t be mad because America won,” he told the American journalist.\n\nThe video comes at a time when the FBI is struggling to locate 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie, mother of Today host Savannah Guthrie, after her abduction earlier this month. Apparently work-shy Patel, nicknamed Keystone Kash for his ham-fisted efforts as head of the bureau, also has a growing crisis in Mexico to consider.\n\nA military operation that resulted in the death of the head of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, one of the world’s most-wanted drug traffickers, has sparked chaos on the streets of many places popular with tourists, including Americans.\n\nAs a result, Americans in affected areas have been ordered to shelter in place due to safety concerns. “Due to ongoing, widespread security operations and related road blockages and criminal activity in many areas of Mexico, U.S. citizens should shelter in place until further notice,” the State Department announced on Sunday.\n\nPatel also posted on X while watching the Team USA game from a box inside Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe post came after an armed man was shot and killed when he entered the secure perimeter of Mar-a-Lago, President Donald Trump’s residence in Florida.",

    "description": "Critics worry about what forgiveness and repayment options borrowers may have if federal student loans are sold to private lenders.",
    "fullText": "The Education Department said it has not made a final decision on selling off federal student loans.\n\nIt's the first time the administration has publicly acknowledged that a sale to private companies is under consideration.\n\nIt comes as private lenders prepare for an influx of borrowers amid looming repayment changes.\n\nThe future ownership of the federal student-loan portfolio is up in the air.\n\nOn Monday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren released a response she received in early February from Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent regarding the potential sale of federal student loans to private companies. Kent wrote in his letter that the administration has \"met with a variety of stakeholders to discuss ideas to reform the student loan portfolio\" with the goal of reducing the $1.7 trillion burden on borrowers.\n\n\"The Department has not taken any final actions or made final decisions regarding selling all or part of the student loan portfolio,\" Kent said. \"We continue to explore all viable options to reduce the burden on taxpayers by restoring the health of the portfolio.\"\n\nThis is the first time that the Department of Education has publicly acknowledged any discussions to sell off federal student loans. Politico first reported in October that the administration was discussing selling off federal student loans with finance executives.\n\nWhen asked for additional detail on a potential sale, Ellen Keast, the press secretary for higher education, told Business Insider that \"we continue to evaluate and implement strategies to strengthen the fiscal integrity of the nearly $1.7 trillion portfolio and safeguard the interests of both students and taxpayers.\"\n\nWhile it's unclear when, or if, a sale would occur, Warren and education policy experts have previously expressed concerns about handing student loan servicing over to private companies. Federal student loans tend to offer more generous forgiveness and repayment plans than private lenders, and it's unclear which plans borrowers would have access to should their loans be sold.\n\n\"Instead of helping Americans drowning with student loan debt, Trump is thinking up ways to make life worse for borrowers,\" Warren said in a statement. \"If the Trump administration cared about working-class families, it would stop its ridiculous plan to sell out families to Wall Street.\"\n\nWith major changes coming for student-loan repayment, private lenders are gearing up for a big year. Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation called for new repayment plans and borrowing caps for advanced degrees, and the leaders of major private lenders previously said they're preparing for an influx of borrowers seeking additional financing that the federal system would no longer cover.",

    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nIf you've been waiting for mortgage rates to dip below 6%, wait no longer. According to the Zillow lender marketplace, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.86%. The 15-year fixed rate is 5.41%.\n\nMORE: 6% or less — See which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nMORE: Read about the best mortgage refinance lenders right now.\n\nYou can use the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator below to play around with how different terms and rates will affect your monthly payment. Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders.\n\nToday’s average 30-year mortgage rate is 5.86%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low.\n\nIf you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 5.86% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,772, and you’d pay $337,826 in interest over the life of the loan.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.41% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to compound.\n\nHowever, your monthly payments will be higher because you’re squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.41% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,437. But you’d only pay $138,650 in interest over the life of the loan. That's a sizable savings.\n\nHow much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\n\nWith an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year.\n\nAdjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate will go up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends — that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later.\n\nLately, ARM rates have occasionally been similar to or higher than fixed rates. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nYou can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown is also an option — for example, maybe you get a 6.25% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4.25% for year one, increase to 5.25% for year two, then settle in at 6.25% for the remainder of your term.\n\nJust consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself if you’ll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.\n\nHere are interest rates for some of the most popular mortgage terms: According to Zillow data, the national average 30-year fixed rate is 5.86%, the 15-year fixed rate is 5.41%, and the 5/1 ARM rate is 5.97%.\n\nA normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 5.86%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data. Zillow's rates are usually lower than those reported by Freddie Mac and elsewhere. Each source compiles rates using different methods. Zillow obtains rates from its lender marketplace, and Freddie Mac pulls information from loan applications submitted to its underwriting system. The average might be higher or lower depending on where you live in the U.S. And of course, your credit score.\n\nAccording to January forecasts, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.1% through 2026. Fannie Mae also predicts a 30-year rate near 6% through the end of the year.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nYou can usually refinance your mortgage with the same bank or lender, but you don’t have to. Learn the pros and cons of using the same lender.\n\nThe best mortgage lenders offer low interest rates, a range of loan programs, and high customer satisfaction. Choose the best mortgage lender for your needs.\n\nYou can get a low-cost refinance by shopping for mortgage lenders or boosting your credit score.

I am proud of my faith.”\n\nShapiro may be the nation's most prominent Jewish politician as antisemitism surges across America, and he's made his religion central to his political identity — what he calls living his faith “out loud.” At this pivotal moment, as he marches toward a dominant reelection this fall that is expected to propel him into the next presidential campaign, the 52-year-old governor is attempting to straddle an almost impossible chasm as both a Jewish progressive and a Zionist.\n\nPerhaps more than any other issue, Shapiro’s ability to navigate personal and political risks related to his faith will ultimately determine how far he can rise in an evolving Democratic Party.\n\nHe is already among his party's top White House prospects, powered by a broad political coalition he's assembled in one of the nation's most important swing states. He's also one of the leaders most vilified by progressive activists, largely because of his staunch support for Israel.\n\nShapiro has defended Israel’s right to defend itself after Hamas' attack on Oct. 7, 2023, while also voicing concern for Palestinian civilians and criticizing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a “dangerous and destructive force.\" At home, the governor was critical of pro-Palestinian campus protests that he said were hostile toward Jewish students.\n\nHis positioning did not sit well among some critics, who still refer to him as “Genocide Josh.” Tensions were reopened with Shapiro’s recent book, in which he recalled a senior aide to Kamala Harris asking if Shapiro had ever been an agent of the Israeli government while he was being vetted as a potential vice president.\n\nThere's never been a Jewish president or vice president, and few leading Democrats lean into their faith as openly as Shapiro. He observes Shabbat every Friday night with his family. He keeps kosher. His kids go to Jewish day school. And on the campaign trail, he speaks openly about his spiritual values and quotes the Bible at virtually every stop.\n\nShapiro’s allies acknowledge the risks, but they ultimately believe his faith will help him connect with more Americans as he takes the next step in his political career.\n\n“He is intentionally choosing to go a different route and to be a different person, and it’s authentic to who he is and also what he believes,” said Baptist Pastor Marshall Mitchell, a close friend and spiritual adviser to Shapiro. “Great elected officials, great Americans, great thinkers, never discount the influence and impact of faith.”\n\nShapiro said in an interview with The Associated Press that antisemitism is “a very real problem” among both Democrats and Republicans.\n\n“I think anyone who’s trying to lead this country, anyone who’s trying to lead a state, lead a community, has a responsibility to call it out no matter which side of the aisle it’s on,\" he said.\n\nThe governor said he and his family face new incidents of antisemitism on a regular basis, citing most recently the February arrest of a man near Harrisburg charged with making terroristic threats and stalking.\n\nAnti-Defamation League leader Jonathan Greenblatt, a Shapiro ally, said he’s currently seeing the highest levels of antisemitic hate crimes and harassment nationwide since his organization began tracking such data more than a half century ago.\n\nGreenblatt criticized extremists and leaders from both political parties, but he was quick to praise President Donald Trump for opposing anti-Israel protests on college campuses, even if the president's approach was “heavy handed.”\n\n“I think we need to recognize that on the far left, in progressive circles, being anti-Zionist has become very permissible,\" Greenblatt said.\n\nZionism is the belief that the Jewish people have a right to establish a Jewish nation-state in their ancestral homeland in the Middle East.\n\nHamas' attack on Israel and Israel's subsequent war in Gaza became a dividing line in American politics as Shapiro's clout was rising.\n\nAs protests against Israel spread, Shapiro said universities should not tolerate antisemitic intimidation any more than they would allow white supremacy, a comparison that inflamed critics on the left.\n\n“Gov. Shapiro has a damning history regarding U.S. policy toward Israel, including his failure to call for an end to U.S. complicity in the Israeli genocide in Gaza, and his smearing and attacks against those speaking out for Palestinian rights,” said Beth Miller, the political director for the anti-Zionist group Jewish Voice for Peace Action.\n\nShapiro’s leadership, Miller said, “is sharply out of line with his constituency — including American Jews.”\n\nPolling shows that views on Israel are complex. About six in 10 American Jews said Israel has committed war crimes against Palestinians in Gaza, according to a Washington Post survey conducted in September. About four in 10 described Israel's actions as genocide.\n\nHowever, about three-quarters said Israel’s existence is vital for the long-term future of the Jewish people.\n\nIn his new book “Where We Keep the Light,” which was released last month, Shapiro opened up about the vetting process as Harris considered the governor as her running mate two years ago.\n\nHe wrote that one of Harris' advisers asked, “Have you ever been an agent of the Israeli government?”\n\n\"Had I been a double agent for Israel? Was she kidding? I told her how offensive the question was,\" Shapiro wrote. He added that the episode \"said a lot about some of the people around the VP.”\n\nIn his interview with the AP, Shapiro declined to expand on what the question said about Harris' team, and he declined to say whether it was an example of antisemitism.\n\nHe said “we should all be able to agree that antisemitism is wrong” while having “honest disagreements” about U.S. foreign policy.\n\n\"When I analyze Middle East policy, I’m focused on what is in the best interest of the United States of America, what advances our national security, what advances our economic interests, what creates more stability in the globe,” he said. “And in my opinion, that’s having a safe and secure Israel, side by side with a safe and secure Palestinian state, where Palestinian leadership recognizes Israel’s right to exist, and where kids growing up on both sides of the border have an opportunity to grow up with promise and prosperity in their future.”\n\nShapiro, his children and some extended family were sleeping inside the Pennsylvania governor's mansion after celebrating Passover on April 13, 2025, when a stranger broke into the house and exploded multiple Molotov cocktails.\n\nCody Allen Balmer, 38, then called 911 and denounced what Shapiro “wants to do to the Palestinian people.” He later told police he would have beaten the governor with a hammer if he had found him.\n\nBalmer pleaded guilty to attempted murder, terrorism and 22 counts of arson, among other charges.\n\nShapiro said the incident still haunts him today.\n\n“I’m one of the fortunate ones in that I wasn’t killed the way Melissa Hortman was or Charlie Kirk was. I wasn’t injured the way Gabby Giffords or Steve Scalise were physically,” he told the AP, referring to Democratic and Republican members of Congress who suffered political attacks. “But I think we also walk around with the emotional scars of it.”\n\nShapiro said he struggles with the idea that “this work that I love” has also “brought my family close to death.\"\n\n“That’s a hard thing to work through as a as a dad,” he added. “I’m still working through it candidly.”\n\nThe Rev. Jerome Fordham, who leads the Pennsylvania chapter of the National Action Network, said Shapiro's challenges have allowed him to relate to people on a deeper level.\n\n“He’s doing a fantastic job despite the fact that they tried to kill him and his family,” said Fordham, who was in the audience at a recent NAACP gala where Shapiro spoke. ”As a Jew, he can connect with everybody. He understands struggle, just as the Black community understands struggle.\"\n\nShapiro told the AP that he would not back away from his faith.\n\n\"I refuse to live in fear, I refuse to back down,” Shapiro said. “Even though the threats are increasing, the light I see and the joy I find in others is also increasing. And that allows me to frankly ignore the noise and ignore the hate and focus on the goodness in people.”",

    "title": "Why Some Brands Won't Ever Partner With Costco",
    "description": "Costco has plenty of gems on its shelves, from big-name brands to its own in-house line, but there are some brands you'll never see at the retailer.",
    "fullText": "Costco has built up a massive following thanks to its bulk deals and great prices on items from clothing and outdoor gadgets to appliances and groceries. The wholesale club's headquarters-inspired Kirkland Signature brand is the most prominent presence in every store, but regular shoppers are used to spotting big names like KitchenAid, Kohler, and LG. Look closer, though, and you'll notice that there are some brands you'll never find at Costco — no matter which location you visit.\n\nThat's because Costco has a surprisingly complex relationship with outside brands and famously high quality standards for those it works with. There are also cases where Costco has dropped brands due to performance or severed ties due to controversy — like when the store dropped Chaokoh coconut milk over reports of the brand using unethical monkey labor or when Palmetto cheese was taken off store shelves after its founder made controversial social media posts. Still, it's Costco's focus on its own in-store brand that has resulted in diminishing outside brand presence and may make some big names reluctant or simply ineligible to work with the popular warehouse retailer.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons you won't see a lot of other brands at Costco is that the store has placed a larger focus on its Kirkland Signature label over the years, leaving less shelf space for outsiders. Costco got its start in the 1970s, selling other brand products in bulk, but that changed 30 years ago when the first two Kirkland Signature products were launched in 1995. The store brand has grown considerably since, becoming a powerhouse that now accounts for a quarter of Costco's revenue, with Kirkland Products bringing in billions in profit every year. Additionally, many big-name brands are actually the companies behind Kirkland Signature products. For example, Costco brand wines come from a variety of established vintners out of California and other well-known wine regions of the world.\n\nAlso worth noting is Costco's marketing plan, which may appear minimal considering the lack of big public advertising campaigns, but is actually quite strategic. In addition to requiring shopper memberships (thus ensuring only people actually motivated to buy are entering the store), the Kirkland brand generally isn't sold elsewhere, which makes it feel more exclusive.\n\nWhile a well-known brand may easily fetch customers at other stores, the whole point of being a Costco member is to get value, not name brands. Because of this — combined with the fact that Costco has a limited assortment for each type of product — even the big-name brands that do have a place on Costco shelves often have to sell at lower profit margins. For example, a 24-pack of San Pellegrino Sparkling water sells for between $18.94 and $24.69 at Costco. The same amount costs anywhere between $27.98 and $35.76 or more at grocery stores. With appliances, the difference is even bigger: a Cuisinart Barista Bar coffee maker retails for $249.99 at Costco but is listed for $379.95 on the Cuisinart website.\n\nOf course, it's still the similar Kirkland Signature products that can drive an even bigger wedge between the retailer and outside brands. In 2025, for instance, Lululemon, which has never partnered with Costco, filed suit against the store over alleged dupes of its popular apparel under the Kirkland Signature label. The result of the suit has yet to be determined as of February 2026, but, if successful, it could pave the way for more legal challenges by outside brands dissatisfied with Costco's practices.\n\nWant more food knowledge?

    "fullText": "Are the Rockets using Reed Sheppard correctly? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Houston Rockets were a team filled with top-end talent and deep playoff run aspirations after the Kevin Durant trade. However, Fred VanVleet’s torn ACL injury in the preseason derailed the hype, with Houston left scrambling to fix the glaring hole at the point guard position. While results have remained relatively consistent from last season to now, the team’s lack of a controller down the stretch has led to some tough losses, with the most recent example being Houston’s loss to the New York Knicks, where they blew an 18-point lead in the fourth quarter.\n\nA development that some people noticed from the game was that guard Reed Sheppard, who knocked down 10 points in 21 minutes, was absent from the closing stretches. That begs the question: Could Reed Sheppard have helped Houston avoid their late-game collapse? And, could he be the answer going forward at the point guard slot as Houston gears for the playoffs?\n\nSI’s @a_duckett thinks Reed Sheppard can “unlock” Houston’s offense if Ime Udoka plays him more\n\n“Reed Sheppard is the only guard on the roster that can unlock the Rockets' offense, whether by playmaking or long-range shooting. He can't do that if he's not on the floor.” pic.twitter.com/KvG1Cya3rN\n\n— SleeperRockets (@SleeperRockets) February 22, 2026\n\nReed Sheppard has stepped up and received more minutes this year compared to his rookie campaign, which can be partly attributed to necessity due to injuries. However, it seems like coach Ime Udoka still doesn’t fully trust him with minutes in crunch time. After the team’s crushing loss to the Knicks, Udoka demanded that he be “more demonstrative and get us into our sets.” For as much as Udoka can complain about Sheppard, the second-year player was absent for most of the collapse against New York.\n\nIn their next game against the Utah Jazz, which was a 125-105 win for Houston, Reed Sheppard displayed the qualities that have fans complaining about his usage. He shot well from the field, created offensive opportunities, and most importantly, controlled the pace of play. Last year, VanVleet was the controller, and although he wasn’t elite by any means, he provided a calming presence and poise when games got tight.\n\nReed Sheppard could step into that role, and he’s most likely the closest fit currently available. It’ll be up to Ime Udoka to decide if his young guard is ready to take the next step, but as of now, it seems like Sheppard still has a ways to go before earning that trust.\n\nLakers' LeBron James sends seven-word message to Jaylen Brown after viral Bronny James diss\n\nDonovan Mitchell admits the OKC Thunder are overly physical, but teams have to adapt\n\nCason Wallace knew how to step up in the pressure-packed matchup against the Cavaliers\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander saves the day in hilarious Jared McCain vlog",

    "fullText": "After the biggest win of the season over Iowa State, BYU stays home when UCF comes to the Marriott Center late Tuesday night.\n\nUCF is approaching lock status for the NCAA Tournament, and a road win over BYU would just about secure that. UCF is coming off a two-point road win at Utah Saturday without leading scorer Riley Kugel. Kugel is listed as questionable versus BYU.\n\nThe game tips off at 9pm MT on ESPN2.\n\nBest Wins: Texas A&M (A), Kansas (H), Kansas State (A), Colorado (A), Arizona State (H), Texas Tech (H), TCU (H), Utah (A)\n\nLosses: Vanderbilt (H), Oklahoma State (A), Arizona (H), Iowa State (A), Houston (A), Cincinnati (A), West Virginia (H)\n\nKenPom Prediction: BYU 89, UCF 78 — BYU 84% win probability\n\nUCF is considered a consensus tournament team. According to Bracket Matrix — which aggregates 121 bracket projections — UCF is in by each bracket projection and projected a 9 seed.\n\nIn Big 12 play, UCF ranks 7th in KenPom offensive efficiency and 12th in defensive efficiency. Two things that jump out about UCF is their ability to hit the three ball and ability to keep turnovers relatively in check. UCF shoots 35% from three in league play (#3 in Big 12) and are sixth in turnover percentage. They have four players average between 12-14 ppg and then a gap to the next player. UCF is bottom half in the Big 12 in offensive rebound percentage, free throw rate, and two-point percentage.\n\nDefensively, UCF has been susceptible this season. They don’t force a ton of turnovers and really struggle defending inside the three point line. UCF is top half in the conference in three-point defense, but opponents shoot a blistering 58% from two (last in Big 12). AJ and Rob could have a lot of success in the paint this game.\n\nUCF has some really nice wins on their resume that show they are clearly capable — they won at Texas A&M and beat Kansas and Texas Tech at home. They are 3-4 on the road in Big 12 play some of those losses have been ugly; their four road losses have come by a combined 18 points.\n\nUCF leading scorer Riley Kugel is listed as questionable.\n\nRiley Kugel, Guard — Kugel’s availability will be a main storyline to watch. The 6-foot-5 guard averages 14 points on 38% shooting from three. Kugel only has one 20+ point game in conference play, but he is a consistent double-digit scorer.\n\nThemus Fulks, Point Guard — Fulks is right there with Kugel in scoring, also averaging 14 ppg, and leads the team with 6.7 assists per game. Fulks has the ball in his hands a lot and is either creating for himself or others. He does most of his damage inside the arc and shoots 48% on 11 field goal attempts per game. He averages only 1.4 three-point attempts per game, but does shoot 43% on those.\n\nJordan Burks, Forward — The 6-foot-9 wing averages 13 points and shoots 39% from distance on nearly 5 attempts per game. Burks will probably get some time matched up on AJ due to his length.\n\nJamichael Stillwell, Forward — The final piece of UCF’s top four guys, Stillwell averages 12 points and leads UCF in rebounds (7.8) and steals (1.2). At 6-foot-8 and 225 pounds, Stillwell is a physical forward who can create mismatches with his strength in the paint.\n\nUCF is a good team who is capable of pulling an upset here. BYU is coming off its biggest win of the season and is ripe for a letdown if players aren’t locked in. With or without Kugel, UCF has enough options to give BYU’s defense trouble. If Kugel can go, then BYU will need to be locked in defensively. UCF is balanced offensively in their starting five, and BYU has often struggled against teams where they can’t really lock in on just a couple guys. Iowa State is better than UCF, but BYU knew they had to give Momcilovic no space.\n\nI ultimately like BYU. One, I don’t think UCF can slow down BYU enough. UCF is terrible at defending the paint and midrange, so I could see both AJ Dybantsa and Rob Wright having big games. This could be a game where AJ scores 35+ points and throws multiple lobs to AJ after breakdowns from UCF’s back line. I also just have a hard time seeing BYU losing this game in Provo, especially with some of UCF’s road struggles.\n\nI’ll pick BYU to win but UCF to keep within striking distance most of the game.",

    "description": "As Snoop Dogg attends his first Swansea City game, BBC Sport Wales looks at how the sport-loving American rapper became an investor in the Welsh club.",
    "fullText": "Microphone in hand, shades on despite the dimmed lights, Snoop Dogg is going through a back catalogue of hits that has made him one of the biggest hip hop stars in the world.\n\nAll while wearing a Swansea City beanie hat and hoodie.\n\nIf the social media videos from Monday night's private party in an industrial estate on the outskirts of the city don't seem surreal enough, Tuesday night will see Snoop take his seat at the Swansea.Com Stadium for his first game since becoming an investor in the Championship club.\n\nAfter the introduction of Hollywood to EFL ownership at Wrexham with Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac, here is Swansea City's next episode.\n\n\"It's a bit different, I think you can say that,\" says Swans supporter and fanzine editor Steven Carroll, understatedly summing up the feeling of a fanbase.\n\n\"But it's definitely captured the imagination and that can only be a positive.\"\n\nSwansea have 'job to do' as Snoop Dogg visits\n\nSnoop Dogg aiming to make Swansea a 'global name'\n\nResponsible for selling 35 million records worldwide, Snoop Dogg can now add record ticket sales to his resume.\n\nThe club have opened up sections of the away end because of the spike in interest, meaning not only have the 'sold out' signs gone up for the visit of Preston North End, the game is also set to see more Swansea fans in the ground than ever before.\n\nIt's a short term hit of buzz for a club that lost its way after relegation from the Premier League in 2018.\n\nEyes, however, are now on a return - with the involvement of Snoop part of a longer-term plan that Swansea chief executive Tom Gorringe says has \"no limits\".\n\nBrought on board by the club's US owners Brett Cravatt and Jason Cohen in July, Snoop's minority stake didn't mean a large injection of cash.\n\nBut it did mean a huge boost to its ability to sell itself.\n\n\"The reality is that if we operated within our natural resources we couldn't compete financially,\" says Gorringe, speaking just after helping show Snoop around the club's training base on Monday afternoon where he met players and staff.\n\n\"PSR (profit and sustainability rules) is our biggest constraint. We are up against sides with parachute payments and we have one of the lowest turnovers.\n\n\"We have to think of new ways to generate income. We are an underdog and part of the attraction for him is the difference he can make with the pull he naturally has.\"\n\nThat pull includes more than 100 million social media followers – more than Wrexham's ownership combined – that Swansea have already looked to make the most of.\n\nBeyond growing the brand and the wider fan base, which Gorringe admits \"takes time\", there have already been tangible benefits.\n\nIncome has seen tie-ins, including clothing collaborations with Snoop's own publishing label, the iconic Death Row Records that was once the home of Dr Dre and Tupac Shakur.\n\n\"By December, our retail business surpassed last year's revenue,\" says Gorringe, who has previously suggested that sponsorship deals for next year are set to be bigger and better than any previous agreement.\n\nWhy Swansea would want to have Snoop on board – and in the stadium – is obvious. Why Snoop is at Swansea could seem less so.\n\nHis history, though, suggests he's not short of entrepreneurialism, including investing in social news site Reddit in 2014.\n\nThe opportunity at Swansea combined that interest with his long-held association with sport, most recently seen during his role as Team USA's 'honorary coach' at the Winter Olympics.\n\nWhether cheering on competitors or trying out the sports themselves – including curling - he combined his role with work for US broadcasters, as he did at the Summer Games in Paris for which he won an Emmy. Views of his videos for NBC in Milan-Cortina are reported to have hit 73 million.\n\nHis love of NFL is well known too. A Pittsburgh fan, he's arranged for every fan at tomorrow's game to have a Snoop and Swansea branded towel to emulate the twirling performed by Steelers crowds.\n\nQuite how the Preston fans respond to that sight is another thing.\n\n\"That's actually part of the attraction,\" laughs Gorringe when asked if he's told the self-confessed 'soccer' fan about what to expect. \"He's watched enough of how fans interact here and that it's very different to US sports. He loves that passion and tribalism.\"\n\nSnoop's friend and fellow minority investor, US TV personality and billionaire businesswoman Martha Stewart, has already sampled the EFL environment after attending the December win over Wrexham.\n\nGiven how long it has taken Snoop to experience such atmospheres for himself, there will be those who wonder if this is more gimmick that genuine.\n\nUnlike at Wrexham, Snoop has no formal role, no decision-making power, just contributions and offers to help in the ways he can.\n\nBut similarly to how Reynolds and Mac have emotionally invested in north Wales, buying into something bigger is seen as part of the desire to get involved.\n\n\"There's a definite excitement about being part of things and he was really engaged in it all - but it's clear he's aware there's a responsibility,\" adds Gorringe. \"He wants to learn more about the city and the community because he sees that as an important role.\n\n\"It would be easy for this to be done as a PR stunt but understanding the city is the heart of who we are and who he is.\"\n\nIn other words, someone who didn't always find life easy has an affinity for the 'underdog', predominantly working class, city.\n\nIt's why some of the first meetings at the training ground were with the kitmen and team chef, not only long-serving members of staff but very much of the local area and die-hard fans.\n\nIt is also why Snoop bought up a number of tickets for Tuesday's game himself so he can donate to community groups.\n\n\"Who knows, the weather might be nice and he might think the Gower is better than LA,\" laughs Steven Carroll of the SoS (Save our Swans) fanzine.\n\n\"We'll see what happens, but he's the biggest celebrity to ever step foot in Swansea and its an association we seem to be benefitting from.\n\n\"It doesn't even matter if he doesn't know the players' names, that's not what he's here for.\"\n\nStewart joins Snoop and Modric as Swans co-owner\n\nBallon d'Or to boardroom – why Swansea for Modric?\n\nSwansea's third high-profile investor is more likely to have an influence on that front.\n\nFormer Ballon d'Or winner Luka Modric is also a minority shareholder - but is yet to make his first visit as he continues to perform at the top level with AC Milan.\n\nThe 40-year-old Croatia captain is described by Gorringe as \"an unbelievable asset\" who watches every game and is \"really integrated\" as he prepares for a life after playing.\n\nHe has spoken to Snoop on Swansea, just as Snoop met and spoke with manager Vitor Matos on Monday, with the Swans' former Liverpool coach denying the spotlight is a distraction as they aim to keep the play-offs in range.\n\n\"It's always good and exciting for the club, for the city, having someone like him with his profile,\" said Matos, whose side are six points off the top six.\n\n\"When you have people who care about the club on the top of the organisation it's always good.\n\n\"But what motivates us and what needs to motivate us is the fans, the noise of the people in the stands, it's about a granddad taking his grandchild to the stadium, the legacy that you bring to the stadium from old times to now.\n\n\"I think that's what we want to build from and Snoop is another person to help us do that.\"\n\nEven it does all seem a little surreal.\n\nLatest Swansea City news, analysis and fan views",

    "title": "Lasses Spotlight: Poppy Pattinson — A Lioness Forged In Sunderland!",
    "description": "“Pattinson’s story is one of dedication, growth and homegrown pride”, writes Charlotte Patterson.",
    "fullText": "When Poppy Pattinson received her first senior England call up last week, it felt like a moment to which her career had been quietly building for years.\n\nFor those who’ve followed her journey from the very beginning — particularly Sunderland supporters who watched her grow from a determined youngster into a polished professional — the news carried a familiar sense of pride.\n\nPattinson isn’t the first player to rise from Sunderland’s academy to the international stage and nor will she be the last. Every time it happens, it highlights something deeply embedded within the club’s identity: Sunderland AFC Women is one of the most important talent factories in English football.\n\nPattinson’s story is not only about her own perseverance and development. It’s also about the environment that shaped her, the club that nurtured her and the lineage of exceptional footballers who walked the same path before her.\n\nFrom Lucy Bronze to Jill Scott; from Steph Houghton to Beth Mead, Sunderland’s academy has produced some of the most influential figures in the modern women’s game — and Pattinson now joins that extraordinary list.\n\nBorn in Houghton-le-Spring in 2000, Pattinson grew up on the outskirts of Wearside, surrounded by a footballing culture that runs deeply throughout the region.\n\nShe joined Sunderland Girls Academy at the age of eight and spent five formative years there, developing the technical foundations and competitive instincts that would define her career. Her early years at the club coincided with a period when Sunderland were becoming a powerhouse in women’s football development, producing players who would go on to shape the national team for more than a decade.\n\nHer first spell at Sunderland ended when she moved to Middlesbrough at thirteen, but the pull of home and of Sunderland proved strong.\n\nIn 2015, she returned to the club — this time stepping into the senior environment.\n\nShe made her senior debut during the 2017 Spring Series, featuring twice in WSL 1 for the Black Cats, and in those brief appearances, she showed the qualities that would become her trademarks: composure on the ball, intelligence in her positioning and a willingness to drive forward from left back.\n\nFor Sunderland fans, witnessing a local girl break into the first team is always special, and seeing one who’d come through the academy from childhood made it even more meaningful. Pattinson was one of their own, another young talent shaped by the club’s ethos of hard work, humility and ambition.\n\nFollowing the 2017 Spring Series, Pattinson made the bold decision to join Manchester City — a move that reflected her ambition.\n\nAt the time, City were one of the top sides in the country and competition for places was fierce. Although she didn’t make a competitive senior appearance, she was a key figure in the club’s development squad, helping them win both the FA WSL Academy League Northern Division and the Development League Cup.\n\nPattinson’s next step came in 2018, when she signed for Bristol City.\n\nUnder manager Tanya Oxtoby, Pattinson flourished, becoming an integral part of the team and missing just one league match in her first season as Bristol finished sixth in the WSL. Her second season was disrupted by injury, but she returned in December 2019 to help the club battle against relegation and by the time her contract expired in 2020, she had established herself as one of the league’s most promising young full back.\n\nEverton came calling that summer, offering her a two year deal, and Pattinson continued to grow on Merseyside, making thirty nine appearances across all competitions and scoring her first senior goal.\n\nHer time at Everton showcased her increasing maturity. She was no longer just a promising youngster — she’d become a reliable, consistent performer in one of the league’s most competitive environments.\n\nIn 2022, she moved to Brighton and Hove Albion, where she added another layer to her game, scoring her first goal for the club in an FA Cup win over Birmingham City in March 2023 and becoming a regular presence in the side across three seasons. Her performances were marked by a blend of defensive discipline and attacking intent. — the hallmarks of a modern full back.\n\nPattinson’s England journey has been steady and consistent, representing her country at U17, U19, U21 and U23 level, scoring in the 2017 UEFA Women’s Under 17 Championship and featuring prominently in multiple youth tournaments.\n\nHer progression through the age groups reflected her reliability and adaptability — qualities that England managers value highly — and her senior call up in 2026 felt like the natural next step.\n\nIt wasn’t the result of a sudden breakthrough. It was the product of years of hard work, steady improvement and consistent performances across the WSL. For Sunderland supporters, it was a moment of immense pride as another academy graduate reached the highest level of the game.\n\nTo understand why Pattinson’s call up resonates so deeply on Wearside, you have to understand Sunderland’s extraordinary history in women’s football development.\n\nThe club’s academy has produced some of the most influential players in England’s modern era, from Lucy Bronze, (widely regarded as one of the best full backs in the world), Steph Houghton, a former England captain and a defining figure in the WSL, and Jill Scott, a Lionesses legend with more than 150 caps.\n\nSunderland also nurtured Beth Mead, a Euro 2022 Golden Boot winner and Player of the Tournament, Jordan Nobbs, a creative midfielder with a decade of international experience, Carly Telford, a longstanding goalkeeper. Demi Stokes, a key part of England’s defensive unit for years, and Lucy Staniforth, a technically gifted midfielder with international pedigree.\n\nThis list is not only impressive — it’s transformative.\n\nThese players have shaped the identity of the Lionesses, contributed to England’s rise on the global stage, and inspired countless young girls across the country, and Pattinson now joins that lineage. She’s part of a legacy that stretches back more than a decade, a legacy built on the foundations of Sunderland’s commitment to youth development, community engagement and opportunity.\n\nThere’s no single explanation for Sunderland’s remarkable success in producing elite footballers, but several factors stand out.\n\nThe region’s footballing culture is deeply ingrained. Wearside is a place where football is more than a sport. It’s a shared identity; a source of pride and a constant presence in daily life. Young players grow up surrounded by passion, expectation and community support.\n\nSunderland’s academy has long prioritised technical development and competitive experience. Players are encouraged to express themselves, to play with intelligence and to understand the game deeply. This approach has consistently produced footballers who are tactically astute and adaptable.\n\nHistorically, this club has provided opportunities for young players to step into senior football earlier than they might’ve done elsewhere. For many — including Pattinson — those early senior experiences are invaluable.\n\nThere’s also the influence of role models and when young players see Bronze or Mead succeeding on the world stage, knowing they once stood where they stand now, it creates a powerful sense of possibility.\n\nFor Sunderland supporters, Pattinson’s England call up is not only a personal achievement for her — it’s a reaffirmation of the club’s identity. Even during periods when the senior team has faced challenges, the academy remained a beacon of excellence and a reminder that Sunderland’s contribution to the women’s game extends far beyond league tables or match results.\n\nPattinson represents the continuation of a proud tradition. She’s a local girl who grew up in the academy, made her senior debut in red and white and has now reached the highest level of international football. Her journey embodies the values Sunderland hold dear: resilience, ambition, and loyalty to one’s roots.\n\nThere’s also a sense of collective pride.\n\nSunderland fans have watched her grow, move through the leagues, overcome injuries and refine her game. They’ve followed her career not only because she’s talented, but because she is one of theirs and every step she takes on the international stage reflects back on the club that helped shape her.\n\nPattinson’s England call up is likely just the beginning.\n\nAt twenty five, she’s entering her prime years as a defender and her experience across multiple WSL clubs, as well as her tactical intelligence and her consistency, makes her a strong candidate for a long international career.\n\nFor Sunderland, her success reinforces the club’s reputation as a cradle of talent. It also inspires the next generation of academy players, who can look at Pattinson and see a clear pathway from Wearside to the world stage.\n\nPattinson’s story is one of dedication, growth and homegrown pride. She’s the latest in a long line of exceptional footballers forged in Sunderland’s academy and her rise to the England senior squad is a testament to both her own hard work and the club’s enduring commitment to developing elite talent.\n\nFor Sunderland supporters, her journey is a reminder of what their club stands for: local identity, community, and the belief that world class footballers can come from the streets and schools of Wearside.\n\nAs Pattinson hopefully steps onto the pitch in an England shirt for the first time as a senior, she’ll carry not only her own dreams but the hopes and pride of a region that’s always believed in her.\n\nIn doing so, she’ll ensure that Sunderland’s remarkable conveyor belt of talent continues to roll along— strong, steady and unstoppable.",

    "description": "The John R.",
    "fullText": "The John R. Wooden Award will celebrate it’s 50th anniversary this season. Leading up to the award ceremony on April 10, 2026, The Sporting Tribune in partnership with the Wooden Award and the Los Angeles Athletic Club will highlight past winners of the Wooden Award and the Legends of Coaching Award.\n\nSure, Tubby Smith led the Kentucky Wildcats to the 1998 NCAA championship in his first season at the University of Kentucky, but that's not what separated him as one of the greatest college basketball coaches ever.\n\nRather, Smith - the recipient of the Wooden Legend of Coach Award in 2016 - stood out because of his rare combination of championship credibility, defensive identity, and personal integrity, intangibles that made him respected across college basketball.\n\nWhile Kentucky is one of the most pressure-packed jobs in sports, figure stepping in after Rick Pitino and having to deliver immediately made things even worse. It was a challenge he never wavered from in 1998, as his team mirrored his coaching tenacity, staring adversity in the face.\n\nThe Wildcats came back from double-digit deficits multiple times in the NCAA tournament that year, earning the nickname \"The Comeback Cats.\"\n\nSo again, yes, winning the title validated him instantly at the highest level, but he needed to carry out the legacy in some fashion.\n\nBeyond Kentucky, though, Smith had stellar runs with programs in tough conferences, like Georgia in the SEC, Minnesota in the Big 10 and Texas Tech in the Big 12.\n\nSmith proved he could win outside of a blue-blood environment.\n\nLike at Minnesota, where his teams weren’t always the most talented, but were organized and hard to score on. All of his teams were traditionally known for their physical half-court defense, structured offensive sets, limited mistakes and high accountability.\n\nIn emphasizing traditional guarding, rebounding and execution, Smith utilized an old-school mentality that instilled true fundamentals to win games.\n\nAnd in games, one of Smith's biggest strengths was his calm, principled leadership style. Never known as a flashy coach, you didn't see him chase headlines and his players understood the importance of academics and character.\n\nHe won five regular-season SEC championships and five SEC tournaments, was named the consensus Coach of the Year in 2003 and was a six-time conference coach of the year in three different leagues.\n\nFrom a cultural standpoint, Smith was an inspiration for the Black community as he became the first African American head coach to win a national championship at Kentucky.\n\nHe will go down as one of the most respected Black coaches in the SEC, and it was his representation that mattered, and still does, considering his resume, record and some of the players he's coached.\n\nSmith was able to stand out because he combined championship-level credibility, defensive identity, composure under pressure and integrity alongside professionalism.\n\nSmith may not always get mentioned with the flashiest names, but coaches around the game deeply respect what he built.\n\nFact is, when mentioning names among coaching greats, like Mike Krzyzewski, Tom Izzo, Bill Self, you cannot leave Smith out of the conversation, as his legacy stands out more so because of steadiness and substance than spotlight.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United registered a hard-fought win away to Everton, opening up a three-point lead over Chelsea and Liverpool.\n\nBenjamin Sesko came off the bench to score United’s winner with a first-time finish. Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha were also involved in the decisive counter-attack, which left Everton’s otherwise solid backline exposed.\n\nFor most of the night in Merseyside, the Red Devils’ attack was flat, to say the least. It was their defensive resilience that paved the way for Michael Carrick’s fifth win since his return to the touchline.\n\nDavid Moyes, as usual, set up a very compact block, giving Manchester United limited space and time on the ball in the final third.\n\nHowever, Everton, to their credit, did not lack intensity or urgency going forward, creating a number of chances and winning a staggering 10 corners. They also had twice as many shots on target as the visitors.\n\nStill, United returned home with a clean sheet and all three points, largely due to the brilliance of Senne Lammens.\n\nThe 23-year-old started nervously at Hill Dickinson Stadium, gifting possession of the ball to Thierno Barry. However, he recovered swiftly, making a number of impressive saves.\n\nMore importantly, the Belgian added much-needed calmness in the six-yard box during set-pieces, as Everton players tried to pack the area and unsettle the United number one.\n\nMoyes took note of Lammens‘ performance when analysing Everton’s display and the final scoreline.\n\nThe former United manager told Sky Sports (via The Independent): “The goalie was bloody brilliant. The save he made from Michael Keane, the way he dealt with the corners.”\n\nMoyes went on to claim the United youngster was the best player in Merseyside on Monday night.\n\n“We hoped somewhere we’d have got a nick on one of them with the pressure we had in those situations. I thought we would get one, but we didn’t. For me he was the best player on the pitch,” the Scot said.\n\nThis was United’s first away clean sheet in the Premier League since March 2025, and Lammens’ third in the last six.\n\nFeature image Michael Regan via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "As part of the \"Real-Club-Legends\" event, former national team player and Real Madrid professional Sami Khedira spoke about the future of Xabi Alonso – and made it clear that, despite Alonso's exit from Madrid, he has no doubts about his quality.\n\nFor Khedira, one thing is certain: Alonso's coaching career has by no means stalled.\n\n“I am sure that he will continue to be one of the best coaches in the world. What he achieved with Leverkusen was outstanding. If you look back at the first four months in Leverkusen, he struggled there as well. He lost some games, the results weren't so good. It took time to implement his system. His style of play needs time, communication on the pitch, understanding from the players, and trust,” explained the 2014 World Cup winner.\n\nIt was precisely this time, Khedira said, that Alonso did not get at Real Madrid. The club operates differently, the pressure is different – and patience is often in short supply. “Maybe he focused too much on his own style and not on the style his top players would have needed. That might be the most important point. Real Madrid is, of course, something special,” said Khedira.\n\nNevertheless, for him it's clear: It's only a matter of time before the 44-year-old is back on the sidelines of a European heavyweight. “I believe that Xabi Alonso will soon be the coach of a top club. In Europe, in England, or elsewhere. He will be a champion again.”\n\nKhedira can even imagine a comeback at Real Madrid in the long term. “I'm also pretty sure that, let's say in 10 or 15 years, he will be coach at Real Madrid again,” he said – and added an interesting assessment: “Then he will be a different coach, not necessarily a better one, but perhaps a different one, to deal better with the situation.”\n\nFor Khedira, Alonso already brings everything needed for the biggest challenges. He already sees him in the same league as the most prominent coaching personalities in modern football: “I see him on the same level as (José) Mourinho, (Pep) Guardiola, and (Carlo) Ancelotti. He has everything that makes a top coach.”\n\nA clear vote of confidence – and a prediction that suggests Alonso’s coaching career still has many chapters ahead, despite setbacks.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "In the 1930s in the Upper Nile region of what is now South Sudan, anthropologist EE Evans-Pritchard met a Nuer woman sitting by a thatched hut with her children. In the distance, the father of her children tended the cattle. They looked like an ordinary family. But this man was not her husband. The Nuer woman was married to a ghost, and her children were officially the children of this ghost.\n\nAmong the Nuer, if a man died without leaving any heirs his kinsmen would find him a wife, in order for his name to live on. They worried that otherwise his ghost would grow restless, haunting and bringing sickness upon them. ‘A ghost likes to think of people asking, “whose son is that?” and being told in reply that it is the son of so-and-so’, the Nuer say. ‘Thus, his name continues on the lips of men’.\n\nEvans-Pritchard, who lived with the Nuer for a number of years, observed that ghost marriages were nearly as common as those between the living. Warfare and disease often claimed young men before they became fathers; childhood mortality sometimes carried off any sons they did have. In such cases, a brother, son, or nephew might marry in their name – ‘kindling the fire of the dead’. As in any marriage, cattle were paid as bridewealth to the bride’s family. The difference was that children born of the union would legally belong to the ghost, carry his name, inherit any cattle he had had while living, and, when grown, assume the ritual privileges appropriate to their ghost father.\n\nThis arrangement could lead to a curious cycle. Because the man marrying on behalf of the ghost gained a wife and children in all but name, the family’s cattle would be used next to secure marriages for his younger brothers. In some cases, the living husband died before ever contracting a legal marriage for himself. And so, in turn, his kinsmen found him a wife after death. Ghost marriage begat ghost marriage.\n\nThe Nuer example presents just one of a wide variety of marriage customs. For much of history, this complexity was invisible to Westerners. Northwestern Europeans assumed that their way of doing things, lifelong monogamous marriage sanctified by religion and nuclear families with male breadwinners, was the natural order. But by the twentieth century, anthropologists were returning with reports of foreign customs which challenged this notion.\n\nMargaret Mead’s 1928 book Coming of Age in Samoa depicted a society that regarded ‘lovemaking as the pastime par excellence’ and where young women aimed to ‘defer marriage through as many years of casual love-making as possible’. At the same time Bronislaw Malinowski’s 1929 The Sexual Life of Savages in North-Western Melanesia described trial marriage among the Trobriand Islanders, where young lovers would live together for a few years in the bukumatula – the bachelors’ and unmarried girls’ house. If this relationship went well, it would lead to marriage, but it could also easily be dissolved. In other words, it resembled modern dating.\n\nGeorge Murdock and Douglas R White went on to formalize this scholarship with the publication of the Ethnographic Atlas in 1967, a compilation of over 1,200 cultures. Two years later, they refined the project into the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample, selecting 186 societies thought to be culturally independent and geographically dispersed. Of these societies, 31 were monogamous, 153 were polygynous, where a man had multiple wives, and 2 were polyandrous, where a woman had multiple husbands.\n\nOne thing became abundantly clear: most people in the world don’t and have never lived like Europeans. Sometimes marriage is sanctified by religion or the state; other times, it is simply what happens when two people begin living together. For some it is chosen, while for others it is coerced. Some societies prize monogamy, others polygamy, yet neither is a clear predictor of fidelity. In some cultures, both sexes can divorce and remarry freely; in others, only men have that right.\n\nCompared to the rest of the animal kingdom, human marriage is even more aberrant. We are among a minority of animals where individuals pair up over long periods of time. Birds pair bond like us, but only nine percent of mammalian species do. For most animals, relationships last only as long as the duration of copulation.\n\nBut we are yet more peculiar. We are the only animal where third parties – parents, siblings, and extended family – routinely interfere in marital decisions, often going to great lengths to shape, delay, or prevent unions. Some societies arrange marriages at birth or very young ages. Many require long negotiations through family-approved channels. Others segregate boys and girls to restrict contact.\n\nWell known is the segregation of women, such as the South Asian practice of purdah (literally ‘curtain’ or ‘veil’), a system that ranges from modest dress to near-complete seclusion. Lesser known is the segregation of men. Among the Enga of Papua New Guinea, boys as young as six were sent to live in men’s houses, eventually joining bachelor cults that taught them discipline and allowed marriage only after they had proven themselves. Only virgins could take part in the final initiation ritual, which involved lying open-eyed beneath a waterfall to cleanse themselves of the pollution caused by having seen a woman’s genitals. Nearby, teasing girls would sing: ‘I urinated further up this creek. Where did you purify your eyes?’\n\nWhether through teasing, teaching or coercion, it is clear that marriage is rarely a private matter. It holds deep significance for the wider family and community. Time and time again it serves the same basic purpose: managing resources and building alliances. So why do strategies vary so widely?\n\nFor evolutionary anthropologists, the answer lies with Charles Darwin. People seek to maximize the number of descendants they leave behind. The best way to do this changes with the environment. And often, the best thing for me may not be the best thing for you. This creates the conditions for the conflicts that occur between the sexes, within families, and between competing groups.\n\nFor around 280,000 years, roughly 95 percent of our history as Homo sapiens, we lived as hunter-gatherers. Today, a few such groups still exist, although these final echoes of a life we lived for millennia will soon disappear as well.\n\nThe BaYaka, who live deep in the Congolese rainforest, are one of these. Anthropologist Haneul Jang, who has worked with the BaYaka for over a decade, describes how marriages happen: an enamored adolescent couple will simply walk off into the forest and a few days later, they return and build a hut. There is no ceremony, no exchanging of vows, just a mutual understanding that they are now together. ‘There is something very romantic about it’, she says.\n\nThe young man may then do ‘bride service’, where he will live with his girlfriend’s family for a year, hunting and collecting honey with his father-in-law. At some point the relationship may dissolve. This can even happen while the couple still have small children. It will end much like it began, with one individual wandering off into the forest and building a hut with someone else.\n\nThis fluidity isn’t unique to the BaYaka but a product of hunter-gatherer societies. Groups are highly mobile, society is egalitarian – any meat from hunts is quickly shared – and there is an almost total absence of material wealth. Fathers look after their children, but they are not necessarily a primary carer. A review of over 45 studies, mostly looking at populations without medical fertility control, found that fathers have a surprisingly small effect on child survival. Other helpers, predominantly grandmothers and siblings, provide more substantial support for the mother.\n\nWhile Murdock’s Ethnographic Atlas classifies most hunter-gatherers as polygynous, this is not accurate. In practice, most men are unable to support more than one wife because there is no stored wealth. Divorce and remarriage happen frequently because helpful extended families give women certainty that they won’t be left raising children alone. The lack of inheritance prevents conflict developing over having children with multiple partners, and the residential mobility means one can literally just walk away from relationships one no longer wants to be in. Consequently, women will frequently have children with two or even three men during their lifetime.\n\nWhen farming arrived 12,000 years ago it transformed almost everything, including marriage. Defending livestock and crops became a priority, mobility decreased, and for the first time in history, wealth could be accumulated, leading to the emergence of inequality.\n\nIn the arid regions of northern Kenya, several pastoral groups still roam with herds of cattle or camels. In 1948, one Turkana man named Imana had 13 children by four wives, all of whom he was married to concurrently. His herd of over a hundred cows made it possible to support multiple households. By contrast, his neighbor, with only ten cows, had to come to terms with a single wife and far fewer children.\n\nIt’s easy to see how the arrival of wealth reshaped marriage: more cows, more wives. But less obvious is that this shift may also have been shaped by female choice. Individual men always stand to benefit, in Darwinian terms, from gaining extra wives, since they have no reproductive upper limit. Women, however, do. They have a choice: be the second or third wife of a rich pastoralist or be the first wife of a poor one. It can pay to be the former.\n\nTaken to its extremes, some men may be so powerful and rich that they can accumulate tens, if not hundreds, of wives. The Azande recount tales of one legendary monarch, Gbudwe, who once spotted an attractive girl as he was walking through his province. Wanting her to be his wife, he stopped to inquire who she was and was told that she was one of his own wives.\n\nOf course, given the benefits to men, not all polygyny is freely chosen. Among the Dogon of Mali child mortality is higher in polygynous households, suggesting women may be coerced into these marriages. But elsewhere, such as in Northern Tanzania, the children of polygynous fathers tend to be wealthier and better nourished.\n\nWhen some men have many wives, women become a limited resource for which men must compete. Daughters become economically valuable to parents, who can demand a bride price, ranging from a couple of cows to a small fortune. To raise the funds, some men must call upon extended family networks and make the payments over several years. Among the Chagga of Tanzania during the colonial period, efforts were made to standardize bride wealth payments: 62 pots of beer, 4 slaughtered goats, 3 live goats, 15 gourds of milk, and half a cow. And that was just the pre-wedding deposit. After the wedding came a cascade of further obligations: heifers and goats to the father of the bride, and still more livestock and beer for her mother, uncles, grandmother, and brothers. To avoid disputes between sons, fathers would sometimes allocate each a sister, whose bridewealth could be used to finance his marriage.\n\nThe second consequence of polygyny is that wealth flows overwhelmingly to sons. Sons can use inherited wealth to acquire more wives and therefore many more descendants. Daughters can only carry so many children. So, across Africa, whenever cows were adopted so was polygyny and societies ended up passing property down the male line, as patrilineal families started to outnumber matrilineal ones.\n\nIn these marriage systems, divorce and remarriage become less frequent, as parents have to return the bride price, and when children inherit, fathers have a vested interest in ensuring they are his. These societies invent ways to limit the freedom of women. The Dogon of Mali, for example, have menstrual huts where women must seclude themselves during their menses. This advertisement of her cycle helps men to protect themselves from being cuckolded. He, along with the rest of the community, will know when she is fertile and so if she falls pregnant without him visiting her he knows the baby isn’t his. This system appears to work. Among the Dogon three religions coexist: Christianity, Islam, and the indigenous Dogon faith, which requires use of the menstrual hut. Genetic data from fathers and sons of the Dogon of Mali found that nonpaternity (a child not being genetically the offspring of their father), though uncommon, was slightly lower when mothers used the hut than when they did not, and that there were higher rates among Christians, whose women are not obliged to signal menstruation. Among Muslims, nonpaternity was no higher than among adherents of the Dogon religion since women must still declare menstruation and refrain from prayer, an equivalent signal of fertile periods.\n\nThese controls apply to both married and unmarried women. Unmarried Dogon girls must also use the menstrual huts, reducing the chance of unwittingly marrying an already pregnant woman, while socializing girls into institutions of control from a young age.\n\nParents can also command a higher bride price for daughters seen as compliant and chaste. Some scholars have suggested that female genital cutting, widespread in Sub-Saharan Africa, functions as a signal of virginity, allowing parents to secure better marriage terms. The evidence is mixed: cut girls do not consistently receive higher bride prices. But they are less likely than uncut peers to report more than one lifetime sexual partner, suggesting the practice does control their sexual freedom.\n\nThe usual pattern is that pastoralists are inegalitarian, inequality drives polygyny, and polygyny drives male control of women. But there are exceptions. Known for their distinctive hair coated in a paste of fat and red ochre, the Himba of Namibia are pastoralists among whom polygyny is common. Yet they are relaxed about infidelity, and many women have boyfriends outside of wedlock. In one sample the child was not biologically the husband’s in 49 percent of cases. There is no cuckoldry, and the Himba know exactly whose children are whose. But her husband helps raise them and pays for their marriages. He doesn’t seem to mind, knowing that the same behavior is the rule in the households where he has fathered children. Men expect their wives to see their boyfriends when they are away but not to flaunt it in front of them. ‘It’s when he stays for tea in the morning, that is when it really upsets me’, described one Himba man.\n\nWhat makes the Himba so different? For one, the bride price is considerably smaller than in other pastoralist groups: typically only one or two cows and some goats. Second, most inheritance passes matrilineally, from a man to his sister’s sons. That blood line is guaranteed: he knows he and his sister share a mother and that her child is truly hers. These two features – a modest investment in non-biological children and the assurance of relatedness through the female line – help men to accept high levels of nonpaternity within their marriages.\n\nNor is polygyny confined to Africa. When Islam emerged in the seventh century, Quranic law sought to cap men at four wives, a limit that suggests the practice was widespread, at least for elites who could afford it. Today, the same logic plays out under different currencies. In Papua New Guinea men with a bik nem, literally a ‘big name’, once used pigs and shells to secure multiple wives. But with the rise of mineral extraction, wealth has shifted. Today it is the dak glas kar men (men with dark glasses and cars) who attract multiple women. As with the pastoralists, sometimes it pays to be the second wife of a rich man than the first of a poor one.\n\nSo how does one explain the parts of the world, like Europe and large parts of Asia, that are unequal yet predominantly monogamous? The spread of monogamy is often credited to Christianity, but restrictions on polygyny long predate it. The code of Hammurabi (1750 BC) let Babylonian men take a second wife only in rare cases, such as when the first wife was infertile. In ancient Greece and Rome, monogamous marriage was the only legally recognized union.\n\nBut even though Roman men were expected to have one wife, they often kept mistresses and fathered many children by their slaves. Similarly, Confucian family law recognized one principal wife for lineage and ritual, but allowed for concubines. Together, these exceptions to the monogamous rule may help explain why anthropological evidence finds that monogamous and polygynous societies have similar variations in male reproductive success.\n\nThe fact that many ‘monogamous’ cultures allow for elite men to have concubines and mistresses highlights the difference between a ‘mating system’ and a ‘marriage system’. Marriage might be more about managing resources than who you have sex with. Monogamous systems, therefore, may have evolved to limit the transfer of resources, rather than as a form of monogamous mating.\n\nIn this explanation, men forgo their right to multiple wives when the whole is more than the sum of its parts, and dividing their wealth among many heirs would reduce its total value. You see this clearly with farming, where dividing land into smaller plots reduces its productivity compared to keeping it as a single estate, a problem that doesn’t occur when dividing a herd of animals. This issue becomes especially acute once there is no new fertile land to expand into – a situation that occurred across Europe in the Middle Ages. This might explain the rise of unigeniture, where only one son inherits.\n\nUnder such an all eggs in one basket strategy, a man needed to be sure this son was his. So women traded their faithfulness in exchange for an agreement that only their children were legitimate heirs. Virginity was prized, and divorce could become almost impossible. Across the world, where paternal investment is higher, so too is sexual jealousy.\n\nWhile women’s sexuality was strictly controlled, men were not faithful, and many would father children out of wedlock. But legislative and institutional systems were built up to exclude these bastard children. Unlike polygyny, where women were the limited resource, under inegalitarian monogamy rich men were. Daughters went from being an asset to a cost as parents had to endow them with large dowries to compete for the few inheriting men.\n\nNevertheless, many of these societies ended up with partible inheritance while still remaining monogamous. After the French Revolution, the government imposed the equal partition of assets among children. Unable to choose just one heir and faced with the over-division of assets, families limited the number of children they had, possibly helping explain why France was the first European country to exhibit declining fertility rates. The same trend has been found in Sub-Saharan Africa. Individuals from ethnic groups where inheritance is shared between all children have lower fertility rates than those from ethnic groups where a single heir is chosen.\n\nNorms are sticky and can become separated from the underlying factor that caused them to originally evolve. Similarly, once evolved, the behavior can take on new functions. Limiting inheritance to the children of one woman is beneficial to that woman, and she has a vested interest in maintaining monogamy beyond a world of large agricultural estates. On the other hand, disinherited children are disadvantaged under such a system and might undermine it as they become more numerous.\n\nIn contemporary Western settings, things seem to have changed once again. Many people are monogamous and have children with a single partner, much like our agricultural forbearers. But others divorce and remarry, similar to hunter-gatherers. Young couples often live together before deciding whether to commit, like the trial marriages of the Samoans. True polygamy is usually illegal, yet some rich divorced or widowed men can attract young second wives, who can bear them a new set of children. Ethical non-monogamists are a growing and vocal minority. To an outsider, it may seem like we have no marriage system at all.\n\nTraditional controls over marriage have weakened. Couples now choose for themselves, usually for love. The disappearance of bridewealth, dowries, and kin-arranged unions has reduced family involvement. While this might feel like a long steady transition for the West, it’s unfolding rapidly in many parts of the world today.\n\nAs states expand schooling, boys and girls mix freely. Mobile phones let them talk privately. Rural-to-urban migration brings people from different ethnic groups together, and when they marry, neither tradition quite applies. Removing the involvement of third parties makes marriages easier to enter and leave. One woman from the El Molo, a small fishing community on the shores of Lake Turkana in Kenya put it bluntly: ‘in my time, your husband could beat you badly and you would stay. Today, the smallest thing, and they divorce’.\n\nIronically, Christian missionaries may have had similar effects. In Melanesia they tried to ban bachelor cults and introduced mixed churches. They preached chastity, while also inadvertently undermining the indigenous systems that had once regulated informal relationships.\n\nLess obvious is how changes to wealth and inheritance might also make marriage more fluid. In contemporary Western societies, unigeniture is either considered wrong or is illegal; we no longer differentiate between legitimate and illegitimate offspring; and children inherit from both parents. Women no longer need to ‘trade’ their fidelity for economic security, and men may well be less territorial (cuckoldry rates range between one and three percent in the West). With women fully integrated into the workforce and earning similar salaries to their husbands, there is little keeping them in relationships they do not enjoy. And fathers who wish to divorce assume that the mothers of their children will be fine raising children alone with the support of their family, the state, and their salaries.\n\nThere has always been a tension between the stability of marriage and the freedom of individuals. This is an important reason why divorce rates drop as soon as couples have children and part of why they remain lower among higher socioeconomic groups. In a social milieu where buying a home requires two incomes and raising children has become increasingly expensive, requiring support and education well into their twenties, a complementarity of roles emerges. If you have little chance of buying a home and fewer payoffs to investing in the education of your children, then it is easier to walk away.\n\nThe tradeoffs between one or many partners, a single or multiple heirs, control or freedom, have shaped marriage for as long as humans have existed. These tugs of war explain the vast variety of relationships we see around the world. Marriage is not fixed but a tool to build connections, secure wealth, and ultimately to pass on genes. If marriage has a nature, it is to be reshaped to fit the world around it. In a world where many of the familiar constraints have disappeared, perhaps all that is keeping us together is love.",

As a company that has been long supported by the nature and people of Aizu, Sigma aims to further clarify its commitment to regional contribution and to a manufacturing philosophy that coexists in harmony with the natural environment.\n\nSigma's Aizu factory has served for many years as the company's sole production site, supported by local communities and Aizu's rich natural surroundings. The skills and spirit cultivated here have shaped Sigma's quality and remain the driving force behind delivering \"Made in Aizu, Japan\" products to customers worldwide.\n\nAt the same time, Aizu―like many regions across Japan―faces growing challenges, including a shortage of agricultural successors and an increase in abandoned farmland. As a result, satoyama landscapes, ecosystems, and local cultural heritage are gradually being lost, beginning with rice paddies that have long retained abundant water and supported the region's natural cycles. In response to these changes, Sigma believes that protecting the natural environment and supporting local livelihoods is an important responsibility for a company that continues to manufacture in this region. Starting rice cultivation through Sigma Aizu Farm is a concrete initiative aimed at sustaining Aizu's culture, landscapes, and ways of life for the future by maintaining and cultivating rice paddies and farmland.\n\nThrough the Sigma Aizu Farm initiative, Sigma focuses on cultivating rice, blessed by the water and soil of Mt. Bandai. The harvested produce is planned to be served in the employee cafeterias at Sigma's Aizu factory and its headquarters in Kawasaki. By shifting from a position of simply receiving the blessings of the land to one of directly giving back to the region, Sigma embarks on a new chapter―contributing to the preservation of the local environment and culture through rice cultivation, while also helping to create traditional and stable employment in the Aizu region.\n\nFuture updates and details regarding this initiative will be announced on the following page:\n\nhttps://www.sigma-global.com/en/sigma-aizu-farm/\n\nFor further details on Sigma's environmental initiatives, visit:\n\nhttps://www.sigma-global.com/en/sustainability/\n\nMADE IN AIZU, JAPAN\n\n\"The Art of engineering.

    "fullText": "The immediate threat may be fixed, but this raises serious questions.\n\nThe immediate threat may be fixed, but this raises serious questions.\n\nSammy Azdoufal claims he wasn’t trying to hack every robot vacuum in the world. He just wanted to remote control his brand-new DJI Romo vacuum with a PS5 gamepad, he tells The Verge, because it sounded fun.\n\nBut when his homegrown remote control app started talking to DJI’s servers, it wasn’t just one vacuum cleaner that replied. Roughly 7,000 of them, all around the world, began treating Azdoufal like their boss.\n\nHe could remotely control them, and look and listen through their live camera feeds, he tells me, saying he tested that out with a friend. He could watch them map out each room of a house, generating a complete 2D floor plan. He could use any robot’s IP address to find its rough location.\n\n“I found my device was just one in an ocean of devices,” he says.\n\nOn Tuesday, when he showed me his level of access in a live demo, I couldn’t believe my eyes. Ten, hundreds, thousands of robots reporting for duty, each phoning home MQTT data packets every three seconds to say: their serial number, which rooms they’re cleaning, what they’ve seen, how far they’ve traveled, when they’re returning to the charger, and the obstacles they encountered along the way.\n\nI watched each of these robots slowly pop into existence on a map of the world. Nine minutes after we began, Azdoufal’s laptop had already cataloged 6,700 DJI devices across 24 different countries and collected over 100,000 of their messages. If you add the company’s DJI Power portable power stations, which also phone home to these same servers, Azdoufal had access to over 10,000 devices.\n\nWhen I say I couldn’t believe my eyes at first, I mean that literally. Azdoufal leads AI strategy at a vacation rental home company; when he told me he reverse engineered DJI’s protocols using Claude Code, I had to wonder whether AI was hallucinating these robots. So I asked my colleague Thomas Ricker, who just finished reviewing the DJI Romo, to pass us its serial number.\n\nWith nothing more than that 14-digit number, Azdoufal could not only pull up our robot, he could correctly see it was cleaning the living room and had 80 percent battery life remaining. Within minutes, I watched the robot generate and transmit an accurate floor plan of my colleague’s house, with the correct shape and size of each room, just by typing some digits into a laptop located in a different country.\n\nSeparately, Azdoufal pulled up his own DJI Romo’s live video feed, completely bypassing its security PIN, then walked into his living room and waved to the camera while I watched. He also says he shared a limited read-only version of his app with Gonzague Dambricourt, CTO at an IT consulting firm in France; Dambricourt tells me the app let him remotely watch his own DJI Romo’s camera feed before he even paired it.\n\nAzdoufal was able to enable all of this without hacking into DJI’s servers, he claims. “I didn’t infringe any rules, I didn’t bypass, I didn’t crack, brute force, whatever.” He says he simply extracted his own DJI Romo’s private token — the key that tells DJI’s servers that you should have access to your own data — and those servers gave him the data of thousands of other people as well. He shows me that he can access DJI’s pre-production server, as well as the live servers for the US, China, and the EU. (He says his tool wipes the data each time he closes it.)\n\nHere’s the good news: On Tuesday, Azdoufal was not able to take our DJI Romo on a joyride through my colleague’s house, see through its camera, or listen through its microphone. DJI had already restricted that form of access after both Azdoufal and I told the company about the vulnerabilities.\n\nAnd by Wednesday morning, Azdoufal’s scanner no longer had access to any robots, not even his own. It appears that DJI has plugged the gaping hole.\n\nBut this incident raises serious questions about DJI’s security and data practices. It will no doubt be used to help retroactively justify fears that led to the Chinese dronemaker getting largely forced out of the US. If Azdoufal could find these robots without even looking for them, will it protect them against people with intent to do harm? If Claude Code can spit out an app that lets you see into someone’s house, what keeps a DJI employee from doing so? And should a robot vacuum cleaner have a microphone? “It’s so weird to have a microphone on a freaking vacuum,” says Azdoufal.\n\nIt doesn’t help that when Azdoufal and The Verge contacted DJI about the issue, the company claimed it had fixed the vulnerability when it was actually only partially resolved.\n\n“DJI can confirm the issue was resolved last week and remediation was already underway prior to public disclosure,” reads part of the original statement provided by DJI spokesperson Daisy Kong. We received that statement on Tuesday morning at 12:28PM ET — about half an hour before Azdoufal showed me thousands of robots, including our review unit, reporting for duty.\n\nTo be clear, it’s not surprising that a robot vacuum cleaner with a smartphone app would phone home to the cloud. For better or for worse, users currently expect those apps to work outside of their own homes. Unless you’ve built a tunnel into your own home network, that means relaying the data through cloud servers first.\n\nBut people who put a camera into their home expect that data to be protected, both in transit and once it reaches the server. Security professionals should know that — but as soon as Azdoufal connected to DJI’s MQTT servers, everything was visible in cleartext. If DJI has merely cut off one particular way into those servers, that may not be enough to protect them if hackers find another way in.\n\nUnfortunately, DJI is far from the only smart home company that’s let people down on security. Hackers took over Ecovacs robot vacuums to chase pets and yell racist slurs in 2024. In 2025, South Korean government agencies reported that Dreame’s X50 Ultra had a flaw that could let hackers view its camera feed in real time, and that another Ecovacs and a Narwal robovac could let hackers view and steal photos from the devices. (Korea’s own Samsung and LG vacuums received high marks, and a Roborock did fine.)\n\nIt’s not just vacuums, of course. I still won’t buy a Wyze camera, despite its new security ideas, because that company tried to sweep a remote access vulnerability under the rug instead of warning its customers. I would find it hard to trust Anker’s Eufy after it lied to us about its security, too. But Anker came clean, and sunlight is a good disinfectant.\n\nDJI is not being exceptionally transparent about what happened here, but it did answer almost all our questions. In a new statement to The Verge via spokesperson Daisy Kong, the company now admits “a backend permission validation issue” that could have theoretically let hackers see live video from its vacuums, and it admits that it didn’t fully patch that issue until after we confirmed that issues were still present.\n\nDJI identified a vulnerability affecting DJI Home through internal review in late January and initiated remediation immediately. The issue was addressed through two updates, with an initial patch deployed on February 8 and a follow-up update completed on February 10. The fix was deployed automatically, and no user action is required.\n\nThe vulnerability involved a backend permission validation issue affecting MQTT-based communication between the device and the server. While this issue created a theoretical potential for unauthorized access to live video of ROMO device, our investigation confirms that actual occurrences were extremely rare. Nearly all identified activity was linked to independent security researchers testing their own devices for reporting purposes, with only a handful of potential exceptions.\n\nThe first patch addressed this vulnerability but had not been applied universally across all service nodes. The second patch re-enabled and restarted the remaining service nodes. This has now been fully resolved, and there is no evidence of broader impact. This was not a transmission encryption issue. ROMO device-to-server communication was not transmitted in cleartext and has always been encrypted using TLS. Data associated with ROMO devices, such as those in Europe, is stored on U.S.-based AWS cloud infrastructure.\n\nDJI maintains strong standards for data privacy and security and has established processes for identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities. The company has invested in industry-standard encryption and operates a longstanding bug bounty program. We have reviewed the findings and recommendations shared by the independent security researchers who contacted us through that program as part of our standard post-remediation process. DJI will continue to implement additional security enhancements as part of its ongoing efforts.\n\nAzdoufal says that even now, DJI hasn’t fixed all the vulnerabilities he’s found. One of them is the ability to view your own DJI Romo video stream without needing its security pin. Another one is so bad I won’t describe it until DJI has more time to fix it. As of February 17th, DJI tells The Verge it will do so within weeks.\n\nAnd both Azdoufal and security researcher Kevin Finisterre tell me it’s not enough for the Romo to send encrypted data to a US server, if anyone inside that server can easily read it afterward. “A server being based in the US in no way, shape, or form prevents .cn DJI employees from access,” Finisterre tells me. That seems evident, as Azdoufal lives in Barcelona and was able to see devices in entirely different regions.\n\n“Once you’re an authenticated client on the MQTT broker, if there are no proper topic-level access controls (ACLs), you can g., #) and see all messages from all devices in plaintext at the application layer,” says Azdoufal. “TLS does nothing to prevent this — it only protects the pipe, not what’s inside the pipe from other authorized participants.”\n\nWhen I tell Azdoufal that some may judge him for not giving DJI much time to resolve the issues before going public, he notes that he didn’t hack anything, didn’t expose sensitive data, and isn’t a security professional. He says he was simply livetweeting everything that happened while trying to control his robot with a PS5 gamepad.\n\n“Yes, I don’t follow the rules, but people stick to the bug bounty program for money. I fucking don’t care, I just want this fixed,” he says. “Following the rules to the end would probably make this breach happen for a way longer time, I think.”\n\nHe doesn’t believe that DJI truly discovered these issues by itself back in January, and he’s annoyed the company only ever responded to him robotically in DMs on X, instead of answering his emails.\n\nBut he is happy about one thing: He can indeed control his Romo with a PlayStation or Xbox gamepad.\n\nUpdate, February 17th: Added that DJI has committed to address the other vulnerability within a matter of weeks.",

    "fullText": "The breathing light – officially “Sleep Indicator Light” – debuted in the iconic iBook G3 in 1999.\n\nIt was originally placed in the hinge, but soon was moved to the other side for laptops, and eventually put in desktop computers too: Power Mac, the Cube, and the iMac.\n\nThe green LED was replaced by a white one, but “pulsating light indicates that the computer is sleeping” buried the nicest part of it – the animation was designed to mimic human breathing at 12 breaths per minute, and feel comforting and soothing:\n\nLiving through that era, it was interesting to see improvements to this small detail.\n\nThe iMac G5 gained a light sensor under the edge of the display in part so that the sleep indicator light wouldn’t be too bright in a dark room (and for older iMacs, the light would just get dimmer during the night based on the internal clock).\n\nIn later MacBooks, the light didn’t even have an opening. The aluminum was thinned and perforated so it felt like the sleep light was shining through the metal:\n\nAnd, for a while, Apple promoted their own display connector that bundled data and power – but also bundled a bit of data, which allowed to do this:\n\nBack when I had a Powermac G4 plugged into an Apple Cinema Display, I noticed something that was never advertised. When the Mac went to sleep, the pulsing sleep light came on, of course, but the sleep light on the display did too... in sync with the light on the Mac. I’ve tested that so many times, and it was always the same; in sync.\n\nJust a little detail that wouldn’t sell anything, but just because.\n\nEven years later, some people tried to recreate it on their own:\n\nTo do this I shifted the first gaussian curve to that its domain starts at 0 and remains positive. Since the time domain is 5 seconds total and the I:E ratio is known, it was trivial to pick the split point and therefore the mean. By manipulating sigma I was able to get the desired up-take and fall-off curves; by manipulating factor “c” I was able to control for peak intensity.\n\nBut at that point, in the first half of 2010s, the breathing light was gone, victim to the same forces that removed the battery indicator and the illuminated logo on the lid.\n\nI know each person would find themselves elsewhere on the line from “the light was overkill to begin with” to “I wished to see what they would do after they introduced that invisible metal variant.”\n\nI know where I would place myself.\n\nThis blog is all about celebrating functional and meaningful details, and there were practical reasons for the light to be there. This was in the era where laptops often died in their sleep – so knowing your computer was actually sleeping safe and sound was important – and the first appearance of the light after closing the lid meant that the hard drives were parked and the laptop could be moved safely.\n\nThe breathing itself, however, was purely a humanistic touch, and I miss that quirkiness of this little feature. If a save icon can survive, surely so could the breathing light.",

    "description": "The economics of COBOL modernization have shifted. AI makes the economics work by automating what used to require armies of consultants.",
    "fullText": "Legacy code modernization stalled for years because understanding legacy code cost more than rewriting it. AI flips that equation.\n\nCOBOL is everywhere. It handles an estimated 95% of ATM transactions in the US. Hundreds of billions of lines of COBOL run in production every day, powering critical systems in finance, airlines, and government.\n\nDespite that, the number of people who understand it shrinks every year.\n\nThe developers who built these systems retired years ago, and the institutional knowledge they carried left with them. Production code has been modified repeatedly over decades, but the documentation hasn't kept up. Meanwhile, we aren't exactly minting replacements—COBOL is taught at only a handful of universities, and finding engineers who can read it gets harder every quarter.\n\nGiven these roadblocks, how can organizations modernize their systems without losing the reliability, availability, and data they’ve accumulated over decades? And without breaking anything?\n\nCOBOL modernization differs fundamentally from typical legacy code refactoring. You aren’t just updating familiar code to use better patterns, you’re reverse engineering business logic from systems built when Nixon was president. You’re untangling dependencies that evolved over decades, and translating institutional knowledge that now exists only in the code itself.\n\nModernizing a COBOL system once required armies of consultants spending years mapping workflows. This resulted in large timelines and high costs that few were willing to take on.\n\nTools like Claude Code can automate the exploration and analysis phases that consume most of the effort in COBOL modernization. These tools can:\n\nWith AI, teams can modernize their COBOL codebase in quarters instead of years.\n\nAI excels at streamlining the tasks that once made COBOL modernization cost-prohibitive. With it, your team can focus on strategy, risk assessment, and business logic while AI automates the code analysis and implementation.\n\nAI starts by reading your entire COBOL codebase and mapping the structure.\n\nIt identifies program entry points, traces execution paths through called subroutines, maps data flows between modules, and documents dependencies that span hundreds of files.\n\nThis kind of mapping goes beyond simple call graphs. Shared data structures, file operations that create coupling between modules, initialization sequences that affect runtime behavior—these implicit dependencies don't show up in static analysis because they involve data shared through files, databases, or global state. They're also exactly what makes COBOL modernization risky, which is why automated discovery matters: it finds these hidden relationships before they cause problems during migration.\n\nWorkflow documentation also emerges out of this analysis.\n\nWith the codebase mapped, AI can assess which components are safe to move and which need careful handling. Modules with high coupling can be more risky to modernize. Isolated components surface as candidates for early, independent modernization. Duplicated logic points to refactoring opportunities. Areas with accumulated technical debt get documented before they become migration surprises.\n\nThis is where human judgment becomes essential. Your COBOL engineers bring the understanding of regulatory requirements, business priorities, operational constraints, and risk tolerance that AI cannot.\n\nThe planning phase develops a detailed roadmap that sequences modernization work strategically:\n\nCode testing and validation are also defined before any code changes:\n\nExecution happens one component at a time, with validation at each step. AI translates COBOL logic into modern languages, creates API wrappers around legacy components that stay in place, and builds the scaffolding to run old and new code side by side during transition.\n\nEach step either succeeds and gets validated, or fails and gets corrected while the scope is small.\n\nYou never have massive changes in flight where failure means rolling back weeks of work. As your team sees modernized components passing tests, they gain confidence to tackle progressively more complex parts of the system.\n\nThe approach outlined above works for COBOL systems of any size.\n\nTools like Claude Code can automate much of the exploration and analysis work described, giving your team the comprehensive understanding they need to plan and execute migrations confidently.\n\nStart with a single component or workflow that has clear boundaries and moderate complexity. Use AI to analyze and document it thoroughly, plan the modernization with your engineers, implement incrementally with testing at each step, and validate carefully.  This will build organizational confidence and surface adjustments needed for your systems.\n\nThe economics of COBOL modernization have shifted. AI makes the economics work by automating what used to require armies of consultants, freeing your engineers to make the migration decisions that require their domain expertise.\n\nFor a step-by-step guide, see the Code Modernization Playbook.\n\nProduct updates, how-tos, community spotlights, and more.

    "fullText": "Every AI founder I talk to is on an accelerating treadmill, burdened by a nagging suspicion that the entire industry is moving too fast in a direction that doesn't quite make sense, with no idea about how to get off.\n\nThere is an overwhelming feeling that if everyone stopped and thought about it for five minutes, they'd build something completely different; but it's paired with a total inability to articulate why they specifically haven't stopped.\n\nNobody stops, because nobody can afford to, and that feeling has a name. It's called Moloch, and it's the most important thing happening in AI that isn't on your roadmap.\n\nA new model drops. It's better at benchmarks. Every AI product company now has to integrate it (if they're a wrapper) or match it (if they're building a model) or explain to their investors why they didn't. Integration // parity takes engineering time, time that doesn't go toward the actual product differentiation that would create long-term value. But the company that doesn't integrate looks like it's falling behind, and looking like you're falling behind is fatal when your entire valuation rests on the assumption that you're on the frontier.\n\nEveryone catches up, everyone shifts resources, everyone ships the update. The net competitive position of every company is exactly where it was before, except they all engineering time on esoteria and none of them made their end-product meaningfully better for end-users.\n\nIt happens every few weeks now.\n\nThis is Moloch; and it'scoordination failure as competition. Every company makes an individually rational decision (keep up with the frontier or die) and the aggregate outcome is an industry that's moving incredibly fast in the direction of model capability, and barely at all in the direction of product value.\n\nThe race is real // the destination is fake.\n\nEvery AI product is converging on the same interface: a chat box. Maybe a chat box with some tool use. Maybe a chat box with some RAG. But at bottom, a text input and a text output, differentiated by branding and minor UX choices and which model is running underneath.\n\nThe chat box won because it ships fast, and Moloch rewards speed over design.\n\nBuilding a novel interaction paradigm takes months or years of research, iteration, user testing. During those months, fifteen competitors will ship chat-box wrappers with the latest model and capture the market's attention. Your investors will get nervous. Your board will suggest you \"ship something\" while you figure out the long-term vision. You'll ship the chat box. The long-term vision will die in a Notion doc nobody opens.\n\nEvery company faces this exact choice and picks the same outcome. The competitive structure selects against creativity. The companies that take time to build something new get outrun by the companies that ship the obvious thing fast. And the obvious thing is always the same thing, because the obvious thing is, by definition, the thing that doesn't need original thinking.\n\nMoloch doesn't want you to build something good.\n\nMoloch wants you to build something now.\n\nThe competitive dynamic is bad enough at the product level. At the fundraising level, it's catastrophic.\n\nAI companies are raising at valuations that require them to grow at rates that are only achievable by chasing the broadest possible market with the most generic possible product. A company that raises at a $500M valuation needs to show a path to billions in revenue, which means it can't afford to be a niche tool that does one thing brilliantly for a specific audience. It has to be a platform, horizontal, aimed at enterprise, built for no one in particular.\n\nEvery AI company is building the same enterprise platform with the same features targeting the same buyers, because the fundraising math requires it, because the valuation requires it, because the competitive environment requires raising at that valuation to attract talent, because the talent market requires it.\n\nNobody in this chain chose this outcome. Every individual decision was rational. The aggregate result is an industry producing fifty identical products, none of which solve any specific problem particularly well, all of which are locked in a feature war that generates zero cumulative value.\n\nThe companies that would build something different (smaller, more focused, more opinionated) can't raise the capital to compete. The companies that raise the capital are structurally forced into sameness. Moloch eats the variance, and variance is where all the actual value lives.\n\nTop AI researchers and engineers go to the companies that are on the frontier. The frontier is defined by model capability benchmarks. So companies invest disproportionately in model capabilty, because that's how you attract talent, even when the marginal return on model capability for their specific product is near zero.\n\nYour users don't need GPT-5 when they can barely use GPT-4 effectively. They need better UX and better integration into how they actually work. But the engineer who could build that wants to work on the model, because model work is what gets you your next job, because the next company is also optimizing for model capability, because they need to attract talent too.\n\nEvery company overspends on model capability and underspends on product quality. The structure forces it. The talent market punishes you for having the right priorities.\n\nThe startup advice I've heard for a decade+ is \"Ignore the noise. Focus on users. Build something good.\"\n\nCorrect in theory, nearly impossible in practice, because Moloch specifically punishes this strategy in the medium term.\n\nBuilding something good takes time, and time means you're not shipping. Not shipping means you look like you're losing, which means talent leaves and investors get nervous, and your competitors (who are shipping fast and bad) capture market position that's expensive to reclaim.\n\nThe window in which \"build something good\" pays off is long, two years, three years, maybe more. The window in which Moloch punishes you for it is immediate and continuous. Most companies don't survive the medium term to reach teh long term.\n\nThe founders who know this stay up at night.\n\nThey can probably see the right thing to build.\n\nThey can't survive building it.\n\nYou can't outrun Moloch. You can only build a structure it can't reach.\n\nIn practice, this means: don't raise more than you need. Don't hire faster than your product vision can absorb. Don't compete on the frontier unless the frontier is where your users live. Find a niche that's too small for the Moloch-captured companies to notice and go so deep into it that by the time they arrive, your product is years ahead in the dimension that matters to those users.\n\nBe small enough that the competitve pressure doesn't distort your priorities. Be opinionated enough that you can't be dragged into building the same thing as everyone else. Be capitally efficient enough that you don't need the growth rate that forces you onto the treadmill. Be weird enough that nobody can copy you without becoming you.",

    "fullText": "There is no GPS at the Red Planet, but a new technology called Mars Global Localization lets Perseverance determine precisely where it is — without human help.\n\nImagine you’re all alone, driving along in a rocky, unforgiving desert with no roads, no map, no GPS, and no more than one phone call a day for someone to inform you exactly where you are. That’s what NASA’s Perseverance rover has been experiencing since landing on Mars five years ago. Though it carries time-tested tools for determining its general location, the rover has needed operators on Earth to tell it precisely where it is — until now.\n\nA new technology developed at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California enables Perseverance to figure out its whereabouts without calling humans for help. Dubbed Mars Global Localization, the technology features an algorithm that rapidly compares panoramic images from the rover’s navigation cameras with onboard orbital terrain maps. Running on a powerful processor that Perseverance originally used to communicate with the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter, the algorithm takes about two minutes to pinpoint the rover’s location within some 10 inches (25 centimeters). Mars Global Localization was first used successfully in regular mission operations on Feb. 2, then again Feb. 16.\n\n“This is kind of like giving the rover GPS. Now it can determine its own location on Mars,” said JPL’s Vandi Verma, chief engineer of robotics operations for the mission. “It means the rover will be able to drive for much longer distances autonomously, so we’ll explore more of the planet and get more science. And it could be used by almost any other rover traveling fast and far.”\n\nThe upgrade is especially valuable given how well Perseverance’s auto-navigation self-driving system has been working. Enabling the rover to re-plan its path around obstacles en route to a preestablished destination, AutoNav has proved so capable that the distance Perseverance can drive without instructions from Earth is largely limited by the rover’s uncertainty about its whereabouts. Now that it can stop and determine its exact location, Perseverance can be commanded to drive to potentially unlimited distances without calling home.  Implementation of Mars Global Localization comes on the heels of another innovation from the Perseverance team: the first use of generative artificial intelligence to help plan a drive route by selecting waypoints for the rover, which are normally chosen by human rover operators. Both technologies enable Perseverance to travel farther and faster while minimizing team workload.\n\nUnlike on Earth, there is no network of GPS satellites in deep space to locate spacecraft on planetary surfaces. So missions — whether robotic or crewed — must come up with other ways to determine their location.\n\nAs with NASA’s previous Mars rovers, Perseverance tracks its position using what’s called visual odometry, analyzing geologic features in camera images taken every few feet while accounting for wheel slippage. But as tiny errors in the process add up over the course of each drive, the rover becomes increasingly unsure about its exact location. On long drives, the rover’s sense of its position can be off by more than 100 feet (up to 35 meters). Believing it may be too close to hazardous terrain, Perseverance may prematurely end its drive and wait for instructions from Earth.\n\n“Humans have to tell it, ‘You’re not lost, you’re safe. Keep going,’” Verma said. “We knew if we addressed this problem, the rover could travel much farther every day.”\n\nAfter each drive comes to a halt, the rover sends a 360-degree panorama to Earth, where mapping experts match the imagery with shots from NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). The team then sends the rover its location and instructions for its next drive. That process can take a day or more, but with Mars Global Localization, the rover is able to compare the images itself, determine its location, and roll ahead on its preplanned route.\n\n“We’ve given the rover a new ability,” said Jeremy Nash, a JPL robotics engineer who led the team working on the project under Verma. “This has been an open problem in robotics research for decades, and it’s been super exciting to deploy this solution in space for the first time.”\n\nThe small team began working in 2023, testing the accuracy of the algorithm they’d developed using data from 264 previous rover stops. The algorithm compared rover panoramic photos to MRO imagery and correctly pinpointed the rover’s location for every single stop.\n\nKey to Mars Global Localization is the rover’s Helicopter Base Station (HBS), which Perseverance used to communicate with the now-retired Ingenuity Mars Helicopter. Equipped with a commercial processor that powered many consumer smartphones in the mid-2010s, the HBS runs more than 100 times faster than the rover’s two main computers, which, built to survive the radiation-heavy Martian environment, are based on hardware introduced in 1997.\n\nAs a technology demonstration designed to test capabilities, the Ingenuity mission was able to risk employing more powerful commercial chips in the HBS and the helicopter even though they hadn’t been proven in space. It paid off: Expected to fly no more than five times, the rotorcraft completed 72 flights.\n\nThe power of the HBS processor inspired Verma to look for ways the Perseverance mission might harness it. “It’s almost like a gift. Ingenuity blazed the trail, proving we could use commercial processors on Mars,” Verma said.\n\nTapping into the HBS computer has had its challenges. To address reliability, the team developed a “sanity check”: The algorithm runs on the HBS multiple times before one of the rover’s main computers checks to ensure the results match. During testing, the team repeatedly found the rover’s position was off by 1 millimeter. They discovered damage to about 25 bits — a minuscule fraction of the processor’s 1 gigabyte of memory — and developed a solution to isolate those bits while the algorithm runs.\n\nAlongside the broader Mars Global Localization process, the team’s sanity check and memory solutions are expected to find new uses as faster commercial processors are employed in future missions. In the meantime, the team has already turned their sights to the Moon, where difficult lighting conditions and long, cold lunar nights make knowing exactly where spacecraft are located all the more critical.\n\nNASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is managed for the agency by Caltech, built and manages operations of the Perseverance rover on behalf of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington, as part of NASA’s Mars Exploration Program portfolio.\n\nTo learn more about Perseverance:\n\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-2020-perseverance\n\nMelissa Pamer / DC Agle \nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\n626-314-4928 / 818-393-9011\nmelissa.pamer@jpl.nasa.gov / agle@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nKaren Fox / Molly Wasser\nNASA Headquarters, Washington\n202-358-1600\nkaren.c.fox@nasa.gov / molly.l.wasser@nasa.gov",

So we're quite cautious about that.\"\n\nDimon indicated that some competitors may be taking a different approach.\n\n\"I see a couple of people doing some dumb things,\" Dimon said, adding that some firms are stretching to boost net interest income or claim they're winning in the markets business.\n\nJPMorgan, he added, is sticking to its own rules — even if that means losing some business.\n\n\"All of our main competitors are back — in the United States, in Europe. The Japanese are back here. I mean, everyone's back. I think that's good. That's good for the world, etc. I just don't know how long it's going to be great for everybody,\" he said.\n\nDimon's comments come as worries swirl over risks in the private credit markets.\n\nThe JPMorgan CEO has for months cautioned that credit conditions could deteriorate.\n\nIn October, Dimon pointed to cracks in the market, citing the high-profile collapse of subprime auto lender Tricolor Holdings and debt-laden auto-parts company First Brands as signs of potential stress.\n\n\"When you see one cockroach, there's probably more,\" Dimon said at the time.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk has weighed in on the risks of handing AI agents sweeping control.\n\nOn Monday night, Musk posted an image of a monkey being handed a rifle on X, captioned: \"People giving OpenClaw root access to their entire life.\"\n\nThe image was originally shared by X user @DEVOUR_ in response to a post from Meta's director of AI alignment and safety, Summer Yue.\n\n\"Nothing humbles you like telling your OpenClaw 'confirm before acting' and watching it speedrun deleting your inbox,\" Yue wrote on X Monday. \"I couldn't stop it from my phone. I had to RUN to my Mac mini like I was defusing a bomb.\"\n\nYue had given OpenClaw full access to her work inbox and told the agent to \"suggest what you would archive or delete.\" Screenshots she shared showed the agent continuing to \"clear everything\" in her inbox even after she told it to stop.\n\nMusk took a swipe at Yue in a reply to another user on X.\n\n\"Someone who got p0wned by OpenClaw is definitely gonna solve AI safety,\" Musk wrote.\n\nPeter Steinberger, the creator of OpenClaw, also chimed in. He wrote on X in reply to Yue's post: \"/stop does the trick.\"\n\nOpenClaw and its agent-only social platform, Moltbook, went viral earlier this year as developers shared videos of AI agents posting, debating, and networking autonomously.\n\nLast week, OpenAI's Sam Altman announced he had hired Steinberger to work on the \"next generation\" of personal AI agents — an effort he said would \"quickly become core to our product offerings.\"\n\nMusk's comments about OpenClaw come amid his long-running, increasingly heated rivalry with Altman.\n\nLast month, Musk escalated tensions by posting on X: \"Don't let your loved ones use ChatGPT,\" responding to a post that said OpenAI's chatbot had been linked to multiple deaths since its 2022 release.\n\nAltman pushed back, defending ChatGPT and OpenAI's safety efforts before turning his fire on Tesla's Autopilot system, calling it unsafe.\n\nEarlier this month, Altman said in a post on X that he's \"really excited\" to take the fight with Musk into court.\n\n\"Really excited to get Elon under oath in a few months, Christmas in April!\" the OpenAI CEO wrote.\n\nMusk sued OpenAI and Altman in February 2024, accusing the company of abandoning its nonprofit mission. He said he had contributed $38 million to OpenAI in its early days under the understanding that it would remain nonprofit. Musk was among the company's original founders, alongside Altman and others.\n\nThe jabs have extended beyond safety debates and lawsuits. Speaking during a live interview with local media in New Delhi on Friday, Altman dismissed Musk's proposal to put data centers in space.\n\n\"I honestly think the idea with the current landscape of putting data centers in space is ridiculous,\" Altman said, drawing laughter from the audience.",

    "description": "In about a year, Ukraine has turned the interceptor drones from an engineering novelty into a mass-produced foundation of its air defense.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's interceptor drones now account for almost a third of the Russian aerial threats destroyed, a top officer in the country's branch for uncrewed air defenses said.\n\n\"If we take into account the share of interceptor UAVs in the destruction of air targets, we have already reached the mark of 30%,\" said Col. Yuriy Cherevashenka in a video interview published on Monday by Ukraine's air force.\n\n\"That is, every third drone target that is destroyed in Ukraine is destroyed by an interceptor UAV,\" he added.\n\nHis comments signal a milestone in the Ukrainian use of interceptor drones. These are typically small, inexpensive quadcopters optimized to fly fast enough to catch Russian one-way attack drones.\n\nThese air defense drones were an emerging novelty in the earlier years of the war, but Ukraine began accelerating their development in late 2024 as a cost-effective answer to Moscow ramping up its regular drone attacks on Ukrainian cities.\n\nA year later, Ukrainian officials said in December that the country was producing 950 interceptor drones per day.\n\nRussia launches thousands of long-range drones into Ukraine every month, and has been known to sometimes accumulate over 800 of them to attack in a single night. Its most common attack drone is a locally built version of the Iranian Shahed loitering munition.\n\nInterceptor drones are built to destroy these aerial threats by ramming into them or deploying an explosive warhead. Much of a successful interception relies on the skill of the pilot and crew, who must spot the Shahed quickly, approach its trajectory, track its position, and then fly their drone into the Russian device.\n\nNot all interceptors are quadcopters, but many are designed with four propellers and a dome-like frame to reach extreme speeds, since the typical Shahed can reach up to 115 mph, while more advanced versions are estimated to reach 230 mph.\n\nCherevashenka said that Ukrainian officials initially worried about dealing with 350 Shahed attacks a month.\n\nNow, however, it's common for Ukraine to fight 350 Shahed attacks per day, he added.\n\n\"Compared to 2022, when the first drone arrived in September over Kyiv, it had a 40-kilogram warhead and was a primitive drone flying by coordinates,\" the colonel said. \"Now, we have 14 types of warheads for the strike drones of the Russian Federation.\"\n\nCherevashenka further warned that Russia has been incorporating artificial intelligence into its Shaheds and is known to use mesh networks to guide them.\n\nEarlier this year, Ukraine reported that Russian troops were regularly accessing Starlink networks via black market terminals, including to guide Shahed attack drones. The complaints prompted SpaceX to cut connectivity over the war zone and allow access only to terminals on an official Ukrainian whitelist.\n\n\"We understand that this is not the end, that they will increase their capabilities,\" Cherevashenka said of Russia's drone industry. \"Moreover, this year they have invested in the production of twice as many drones as last year.\"\n\nInterceptor drones form just one part of Ukraine's multi-layered air defense network. The country also commonly deploys truck-mounted machine-gun crews to shoot down Shaheds, reserving interceptor munitions for higher priority threats, such as Russian cruise or ballistic missiles.",

    "fullText": "The coauthor of an AI research paper is speaking out after his work triggered a global stock sell-off.\n\nCitrini, a firm focused on thematic equity investing, alongside Alap Shah, CEO of Littlebird.ai, theorized a future where, instead of transforming the economy in a positive way, the AI boom erases white-collar jobs and severely reduces the spending power of those workers, and eventually stunts economic growth.\n\nOn Monday, Shah told \"TBPN\" podcast hosts John Coogan and Jordi Hays that despite how well it seems to be going for blue-collar jobs at the moment in terms of growth and the lack of mass layoffs, these jobs won't be safe if white collar jobs go away because ultimately, there is only \"one labor market.\"\n\n\"Let's say in our scenario, we talk about 5% of folks might get fired in a couple of years,\" said Shah. \"Those 5%, if there aren't white collar jobs for them to relocate into, then they're going to have to move into the gig economy and the blue collar labor force.\"\n\n\"And so that puts pressure on the entire labor market, not just the white collar one,\" Shah added.\n\nShah and Citrini published a report on Sunday, written from a futuristic point of view set in 2028, that predicts a negative domino scenario triggered by the AI boom. The research theorizes that AI will kick off a mass white-collar layoff too quickly, which will then deal a blow to the metro housing and mortgage market, and eventually lead to a global stock sell-off and a widespread recession in all sectors. In this scenario, the paper said, AI growth could also lose momentum due to a lack of funding.\n\n\"The system turned out to be one long daisy chain of correlated bets on white-collar productivity growth,\" the paper theorizes. \"The November 2027 crash only served to accelerate all of the negative feedback loops already in place.\"\n\nShah elaborated on these concerns on \"TBPN.\" When asked what he thinks of the current growth in the health and education sectors, Shah said most of it could be spurred by government spending, which would go away if personal income declines.\n\n\"Those sectors continue to grow because government spending grows,\" said Shah. \"But again, gets very circular if government spending is coming primarily from taxes and primarily payroll taxes because the average worker pays a lot",

    "fullText": "SALT LAKE CITY (ABC4) — The Mexican army killed the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel on Sunday, prompting what can only be described as a large-scale, violent reaction from cartel members throughout the state of Jalisco. ABC4 spoke with a Utah woman who is staying in Puerto Vallarta and saw first-hand what is transpiring across the region.\n\nThe woman, who has chosen to remain anonymous for her safety, said she has been visiting Puerto Vallarta every winter for the last seven years. She has been there for three weeks on her own, her husband arriving only a few days ago.\n\n“This morning we got ready to walk to the nearby church,” she told ABC4. “I looked outside and saw a huge billowing dark cloud over the bay and wondered if it was a storm cloud or from a fire. I opened the balcony door and immediately knew it was from a fire.”\n\nShe said as she continued to scan the horizon, she saw smoke coming from the north, as well as the south. She ran to the other side of the house, went outside, and saw seven different clouds of smoke coming from various locations.\n\n“That’s when we knew something very intentional was going on,” she said. “We had no idea the cause, we just knew something was very wrong.”\n\nShe added, ““Standing on the balcony and then seeing these fires in the distance and then all of a sudden seeing them pop up literally right in front of me. And I thought, OK, I’m no longer an observer. I am in this.”\n\nWithin 30 minutes, she and her husband heard a serious of loud pops, “like generators exploding,” she said. They soon realized that each pop was a new car bomb going off.\n\nShe said two went off within three blocks of where they were staying.\n\n“We put on our tennis shoes and packed our passports and laptops into backpacks to prepare to leave in a moment’s notice,” she told ABC4. “But because the bombs and fires were going off everywhere in random places, it seemed too dangerous leave.”\n\nThe couple’s friends in Puerto Vallarta, who live in the same building as where they are staying, told them not to leave and to stay indoors. They all gathered together to watch was happening and try to figure out what to do next.\n\n“For about two hours all we did was watch and listen as the various fires started, and then eventually died down,” she said. “Then videos and images started popping up online and we saw people being stopped on the roads and shoved out of their cars and their cars being bombed and set on fire. Then we started hearing stories of people being shot and cars exploding at Costco and the Costco being set on fire.”\n\nShe added that several small stores in the town were also set on fire.\n\n“Truly, the horizon looked like a war zone,” she told ABC4.\n\nBombers were reportedly riding motorcycles, wearing backpacks, and were the only people out on the streets. Every time the group heard a motorcycle outside, they got nervous, she said.\n\n“We started to hear one motorcycle and then heard a loud crash and looked outside, and there was a motorcyclist who crashed right outside our front door,” she said. “His helmet and shoe were across the street and he was clearly injured, but he was wearing a backpack like all of the car bombers, so we didn’t even dare go outside to help him.”\n\nAs time went on, they learned that all of this was an alleged retaliation for the death of cartel leader Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, also known as “El Mencho.” The U.S. Dept. of State told U.S. citizens in the region to shelter in place, and flights going in and out of Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta were canceled.\n\nThe city was put under curfew and the marina was also closed.\n\n“I can still see a few fires smoldering about a mile or two away, but nothing close by,” she told ABC4. “Two big military ships are patrolling the bay and military helicopters are flying very low, likely looking for potential bombers.”\n\nWhile they didn’t see much police presence during the initial bombing, she said that they began seeing more police cars and hearing more sirens as the day progressed.\n\n“The residents and tourists are all out on their balconies watching from afar,” she told ABC4. “Even those right next to the fires stood on top of their buildings and watched as the cars and buildings burned.”\n\nShe added that because most of the buildings there are made of concrete, cartel members focused their bombings on buses and cars.\n\n“An eerie silence has fallen over the city,” she told ABC4. “Now the worst sound is the occasional motorcycle going by. The best sound is the military helicopters patrolling nonstop.”\n\nShe said that part of today’s devastation is the impact it will have on the city and country. She told ABC4 the cartel violence is going to scare people, halt tourism, and destroy the livelihoods of many living there.\n\n“This is a beautiful city, rich with natural resources and amazing people,” she said. “So many Americans have a perception that it is always dangerous here, but until today, I have never felt the least bit in harm’s way, not in all my trips to Mexico, including Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlán, Cabo, Guanajuato, and Mexico City.”\n\nShe added that she is praying that today was an isolated event that will not shut down the country, or destroy its people.\n\nFlights to and from Puerto Vallarta are cancelled at this time. Taxis and ride shares are also suspended in the region.

This winter still hasn’t recorded as much as usual, but by mid-February, some areas across the state received some much-needed snow.\n\nWhat exactly is a ‘bomb cyclone’?\n\nDenver only saw some flakes fly throughout the week, with nothing recordable on the ground, but other areas recorded almost 4 feet of snow.\n\nHere’s where the most snow fell from Sunday, Feb. 15, through Sunday, Feb. 22, according to Iowa State University’s local storm report:\n\nWolf Creek Pass in Pueblo County saw the most snow with 44 inches, nearly 4 feet, throughout the week. Meanwhile, areas like Crested Butte, Cameron Pass and Rabbit Ears Pass saw over a foot of snow. This snowfall brought a good amount of snow to the ski resorts, but snow totals are still low this winter.\n\nKentucky has seen more snow than Denver this winter\n\nLast year, some ski areas were recording 200 inches of snowfall around mid-to-late February, but this year, areas that have seen some of the most snow so far, like Crested Butte, have only seen 109 inches.",

    "description": "Their statement says Christians have a moral obligation to condemn the demonization of immigrants and attacks on civil rights and diversity.",
    "fullText": "Hundreds of Christian leaders and scholars nationwide are denouncing President Donald Trump’s administration and urging more active resistance among the faithful to “the injustices and anti-democratic danger sweeping across the nation.”\n\n“We are facing a cruel and oppressive government,” their collective statement begins. “In moments like this, silence is not neutrality — it is an active choice to permit harm.”\n\nTitled “A Call to Christians in a Crisis of Faith and Democracy,” the letter says the nation is facing a profound moral, spiritual, and democratic emergency. Its release coincides with the start of the Christian season of Lent, a period of repentance, self-reflection and resistance to temptation.\n\n“We thought it was important to tie into a season where many Christians go deeper into their faith,” said Adam Russell Taylor, president of Sojourners, a Christian social justice organization. “Part of what we’re critiquing is the way in which many White evangelical Christians succumb to an unconditional support of the administration, despite the fact that its actions are completely antithetical to the teachings of Jesus.”\n\nLeaders of all faiths have increasingly spoken out and participated in protests against the policies of the Trump administration, particularly aimed at what many see as overly aggressive efforts to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. Pastors have been arrested and struck with pepper balls during demonstrations.\n\nThe statement says Christians have a moral obligation to speak out against “citizens and immigrants being demonized, disappeared, and even killed; the erosion of hard-won rights and freedoms; and a calculated effort to reverse America’s growing racial and ethnic diversity – all of which are pushing us toward authoritarian and imperial rule.”\n\n“This moment is a defining test of Christian discipleship and civic responsibility,” said the Rev. Jim Wallis, founder and director of the Georgetown Center for Faith and Justice in Washington, D.C.. “Democratic freedoms are being taken away and the gospel is being distorted. The vulnerable people Jesus told us to stand with and defend are being targeted and assaulted.”\n\nWallis and Taylor organized the collective effort along with Barbara Williams-Skinner, president of Baltimore’s Skinner Institute, a faith leadership development organization.\n\nAbout 400 people initially signed the statement, representing a range of Christian denominations, leaders of Black, Asian and Latino churches and associations and Christian universities and institutions. Hundreds more have added their names since the letter’s Feb. 18 release, organizers say.\n\nThe Executive Office of the President of the United States, which includes the White House office, did not respond to a request for comment about the statement.\n\nThe Christian leaders and scholars say aside from the risks to democracy, they are troubled by “a Christian faith corrupted by the heretical ideology of white Christian nationalism.”\n\n“People look at it as just a democratic crisis, but it’s not,” said the Rev. Cynthia Hale, pastor of Ray of Hope Christian Church in Decatur, Georgia, who was among those who signed the letter. “It’s a crisis of faith.”\n\nChristian nationalism, the idea that Christian people and biblical law should govern American life, has seeped into the highest levels of American government with conservative evangelicals becoming a major political force with strong support of Trump. Evangelical pastor Doug Wilson, who has said women should neither vote nor hold religious or political leadership positions, was recently invited by Secretary of War Pete Hegseth to conduct a service at the Pentagon.\n\n“Their religious leaders have been so unconditionally supportive that it’s almost branded this administration as being religious in the minds of many Americans, which is a distortion,” said Bishop Raymond Rivera of the Council of Holistic Christian Churches and Ministries, who also signed the letter. “They’ve confused proximity to political power with proximity to the power of God. They’re not the same.”\n\nTaylor called such conflation “a form of idolatry” and said the Trump administration in turn has misused Christian language to support its activities, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement recruitment ads that quote scripture in their appeals – one ad, for instance, includes a verse saying “Blessed are the peacemakers.”\n\n“That feels particularly offensive and egregious in light of the tactics we’ve seen them employ in Minneapolis, Chicago, Los Angeles and elsewhere,\" he said. \"It’s corrupting the Christian faith to advance its own political agenda.”\n\nKristin Kobes Du Mez, a professor of history and gender studies at Calvin University, a Christian institution in Grand Rapids, Michigan, said she initially wondered before signing whether the moment required something more than signing yet another statement.\n\n“I realized this statement isn’t primarily for people who have been on the front lines of these issues but for pastors and ordinary Christians who may be just waking up to what’s happening and what’s at stake,” Du Mez said. “I think it’s important to offer a statement that clarifies the political and theological stakes and that people can put their name behind…. This is a way for ordinary Christians to step up.”\n\nThe letter concludes by tying a set of core theological convictions to actions the signers pledge to take to practice their faith and protect democracy, including defending voting rights, pursuing peace and standing with unjustly targeted immigrants.\n\nDottie Escobedo-Frank, bishop of the United Methodist Church’s California-Pacific Conference in Pasadena, said she signed the letter to encourage her Southern California community and all Christians to live out their callings to serve the downtrodden, demonstrate compassion and challenge political leaders to act on their behalf.\n\nHowever, with church ministries offering food distribution, childcare or elderly assistance having faced disruption from ICE agents or anti-immigrant demonstrators, “we’re seeing people in our communities who are afraid to live out their faith because of the actions of our government,” she said.\n\nTaylor understands many may be justifiably fearful of living out their creed but said it’s critical for people to engage at a time when “the pages of the authoritarian playbook are very much in effect,” he said.\n\nHe said one way to overcome such fears, aside from leaning into the resilience of faith itself, is to connect with other Christians. The letter effort includes a website where supporters can find ways to get involved.\n\n“One of the most consistent refrains in scripture is ‘do not be afraid,’” Taylor said. “Authoritarian governments thrive on people feeling isolated and overwhelmed, so we’re trying to create a network of solidarity and courage. We have the power to prevent things from getting worse.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Christian leaders say silence no longer option amid 'crisis of faith'",

    "description": "It came just days after Cooper announced he was leaving CBS show.",
    "fullText": "Anderson Cooper debunked President Donald Trump‘s claims of a “genocide” of white South African farmers on Sunday’s (February 22) edition of 60 Minutes.\n\nThe report, which The Daily Beast says was previously delayed by new CBS News boss Bari Weiss and subjected to an “abnormal” editing process, aired on Sunday’s show and saw Cooper traveling to South Africa to investigate Trump’s claims.\n\nIn the segment, Cooper played a clip of the president speaking to reporters in May 2025, in which he said, “It’s a genocide that’s taking place that you people don’t want to write about. It’s a terrible thing that’s taking place and farmers are being killed. They happen to be white.”\n\nTrump repeated these claims a week later when South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the White House. The president showed Ramaphosa video “proof” of what he said were “Burial sites. Over 1,000… of white farmers.” The video featured a row lined with several white crosses.\n\nCooper spoke with the man who erected those crosses, Darrel Brown, who said, “It definitely wasn’t a burial site. I mean those crosses were there for less than 48 hours. It was purely an avenue of crosses we planted there in honor of commercial farmers in South Africa that had lost their lives.”\n\nBrown, who keeps the crosses in a shed, said he put the crosses back up in 2024 for the funeral of his best friend, Tollie Nel, who was murdered on his farm.\n\nCooper also spoke with Tollie’s widow, Rene Nel, and asked her whether she would consider what is happening on South African farms to be a “genocide.”\n\n“Not what I know as a genocide,” she said. “Not what I’ve heard of what a genocide is. I see our attack as an opportunistic attack. They knew there was money. They knew there were firearms.”\n\nJohann Kotzé, the head of South Africa’s largest agricultural organization, also denied Trump’s claims. “It’s actually not about white genocide,” he stated. “It’s about criminality in South Africa. It’s crime. The fact that it happened on a farm doesn’t make me special as a farmer. It’s horrendous. Any murder is horrendous.”\n\nThe report comes just days after Cooper announced he will be leaving 60 Minutes at the end of the current broadcast season. He will continue to host Anderson Cooper 360 on CNN.\n\n60 Minutes, Sundays, 7/6 c, CBS\n\nRead the latest entertainment news on TV Insider.",

    "title": "Why has it gone so wrong for Aston Martin?",
    "description": "The combination of Adrian Newey, Honda and Fernando Alonso was highly promising but Aston Martin are in trouble. Andrew Benson explains why.",
    "fullText": "When Aston Martin's new Formula 1 car first appeared in testing at the end of January, it drew admiring glances up and down the pit lane.\n\nIn its all-black temporary colour, the car not only looked menacing, but also noticeably different from all its rivals. It included the sort of innovations that have become famous from design legend Adrian Newey, installed as managing technical partner at Aston Martin since March last year.\n\nBut reality bit hard as soon as the car started to run. It was already late, and it managed just four laps on its first day in Barcelona before conking out at the entrance to the pit lane.\n\nAston Martin's fortunes have barely improved since.\n\nThe car was the slowest in the field by the end of pre-season testing last week, and had done the least miles.\n\nTeam owner Lawrence Stroll looked like the bottom had fallen out of his world as he stalked the paddock in Bahrain, his face betraying a combination of anger and despair.\n\nThe few times the car was out on track amid myriad reliability problems, it looked a handful for the drivers. Publicly, Aston Martin and Honda were saying little. Privately, no-one was troubling to try to hide the reality. They were in trouble, they knew it, and whatever was wrong - and it was a lot - it would take time to fix.\n\nNo Formula 1 team looked towards the 2026 season with greater expectations than Aston Martin.\n\nOn paper, Stroll had put together a dream combination, one that seemed guaranteed to produce success.\n\nThe signing of Newey in September 2024 seemed to be the final piece of the jigsaw the Canadian billionaire was creating to turn his team into championship contenders.\n\nIn the previous years, Stroll had already inked a deal to become the factory engine partner of Honda, who won four consecutive drivers' titles with Red Bull and Max Verstappen from 2021-24, and two constructors' championships.\n\nHe had funded a sparkling new factory, including a state-of-the-art wind tunnel and driver-in-the-loop simulator.\n\nHe had put together an enviable sponsorship portfolio of boundless resources, including the full financial might of the state of Saudi Arabia, through its national oil company.\n\nAnd in the cockpit was another legend, Fernando Alonso. Ageing, certainly, now he is in his mid-40s, but still without question a major force behind the wheel.\n\nThe past few years have not been easy for Aston Martin. A major step forward at the start of 2023, when Alonso first joined the team, led to six podiums in the first eight races and what could have been a win in Monaco, lost only to a wrong tyre choice during a late shower of rain.\n\nBut in the second half of that season the team slipped back, as they failed to keep up the development rate of their rivals. The same happened in 2024, from a lower starting point, and in 2025 they were simply uncompetitive, slipping to seventh in the championship from fifth the previous two years.\n\nNewey's arrival was supposed to herald the start of the turnaround, especially as historically he has aced regulation changes, producing design philosophies that were followed by rivals - in 1998 with McLaren, and again in 2009 and 2022 with Red Bull.\n\nThe biggest rule regulation change in F1 history for 2026 gave him the chance to do it again, this time for Aston Martin.\n\nBut the first car produced under his leadership has fallen far short of expectations, and a glance at the context makes this less of a surprise than it appears on the surface.\n\nIn F1, success comes from stability, and that is the last thing Aston Martin has had in the past few years. There has been major leadership churn, and right at the top, too.\n\nThis has included new recruits, such as chief technical officer Enrico Cardile, who finally arrived in July after a year on gardening leave from Ferrari.\n\nBut also casualties. The most recent was Andy Cowell, the architect of the success of the Mercedes engine in the hybrid era. He was installed as chief executive officer only in October 2024, but just over a year later, after a clash with Newey, was demoted to a different role.\n\nCowell is now spending much of his time in Japan, trying to help Honda sort itself out.\n\nAston Martin were already playing down expectations when they had their official team launch in early February, emphasising the project would need time to become successful.\n\nNewey has explained that his starting in March left them some months behind other teams in terms of development.\n\nThe new 2026 aerodynamic regulations were finally officially published on 2 January 2025, two months before Newey officially started work at Aston Martin.\n\nIn reality, teams have been working on their 2026 cars for much longer than that. The basics of the cars' layouts in the rules had been known for some time, and the teams had all been in working groups refining the detail with governing body the FIA, so knew where they were going.\n\nThe word is that when Newey arrived in March 2026, he effectively ordered a redesign of the car on the basis of his ideas. So the current car is several months, at least, behind all its rivals in terms of development. With that sort of deficit, even he cannot work miracles.\n\nNewey has described the Aston Martin as \"one of the more extreme interpretations\" of this year's new rules.\n\nRight now, in its under-developed form, there is no question it is uncompetitive - slow and unpredictable. It may yet turn out that it can be developed into a good car, but until Honda sorts itself out, it will be hard to tell.\n\nHonda's plight has brought back painful memories of a decade ago.\n\nWhen it returned to F1 in 2015 with McLaren, it was underprepared, and spent three difficult seasons with engines that were underpowered and unreliable. The similarities with now are unmistakable.\n\nWhy it is so unprepared this time is less understandable.\n\nHonda officially pulled out of F1 at the end of 2021, when Max Verstappen took a Red Bull powered by their engine to his first world title.\n\nIt announced its return to F1 with Aston Martin in May 2023.\n\nThe argument given to explain now being so far behind is that Honda's F1 engine project was essentially disbanded and the engineers involved reallocated to other areas of the company in the 15 months between the two dates.\n\nHowever, it's not like Honda went away. Both Red Bull teams continued to use its engines until the end of last year.\n\nAlthough there was a development freeze, the engine was still being upgraded each year because F1's regulations allowed modifications for reliability reasons. Every manufacturer in F1 uses this loophole to produce performance upgrades in the name of improved reliability.\n\nIf Honda had not been doing this, it would have fallen behind progressively from 2022 to 2025, which it did not.\n\nOn top of that, Honda representatives were involved in meetings about the new engine rules all the way through - hence their U-turn on involvement in early 2023.\n\nStill, the argument is that without a fully dedicated F1 engine department, Honda lacked a team designing and building a new engine to the revised rules for this year, and had to build one up again more or less from scratch.\n\nBut so did Red Bull. In 2020, when they announced their decision to build their own engine factory, they had nothing. The original plan was to go into partnership with Porsche, but that deal foundered by late summer 2022.\n\nConsidering Red Bull had to build a powertrains factory from literally nothing in this period, and recruit an entirely new staff, their timeline is not that dissimilar from Honda's.\n\nSo why is Honda so far away from where it wants to be? No answer to that has been provided.\n\nA new car and engine partnership with Honda that struggles for reliability and performance and has Fernando Alonso as one of the drivers. If that sounds familiar, it's because it is.\n\nIn 2015, Alonso joined McLaren from Ferrari wooed by the promise of Honda's potential. That potential was eventually realised - but not until 2020/21, by which time Honda and McLaren had long since split and Honda had joined forces with Red Bull.\n\nAlonso's career, meanwhile, became a kind of living purgatory. One of the greatest drivers the sport has ever known reduced to fighting for scraps, making up his own targets for motivation, rather than what he should have been gunning for - wins and titles in F1.\n\nHe last won a race in May 2013, and he is now 44. But his performances have continued on a high level, and the respect he has from his peers on the grid is higher than ever. For his talent, and his ability to keep up his motivation in the face of everything.\n\nThe Newey-Honda-Aston Martin combination on paper promised Alonso something positive, a last hope of a return to success with which to bring his storied career to a close. Either this year, when his current contract runs out, or perhaps after one more, if glory seemed tangible.\n\nInstead, he has found himself transported back in time 10 years.\n\nAlonso has waited an entire career to work with Newey, the excellence of whose cars - and some terrible luck - have denied the Spaniard at least two further world titles that he should have won.\n\nAlonso won't doubt Newey can sort this out. Who would? But after his experiences with Honda last time, can he really convince himself that it can turn this around in the limited time he surely still has available?\n\nIn public, Alonso is staying optimistic, just as he did with McLaren and Honda, bar one or two public slips when it all got too much.\n\n\"Everything can be fixed, for sure,\" he says. \"Short and medium term. I don't think there is anything that is impossible to fix.\n\n\"We will try to fix everything we can before Australia and after that we try to fix as many things as possible in the first couple of races. Because (otherwise) it's too late in the championship. But no, I'm optimistic. I think there is a solution in place.\"\n\nAlonso's partner, Melissa Jimenez, is expecting their first child in late March.\n\nThe emergence of the unfolding catastrophe that is Aston Martin-Honda is so recent that he's not yet been asked about his thoughts on his future. But he will already be considering what to do.\n\nDoes he roll the dice one last time, try to summon the energy and commitment to go again after what will doubtless be a very trying year? Or call it quits?\n\nWho are the winners and losers from F1 pre-season testing?\n\n'Keep calm,' says Domenicali on criticism of new F1 rules",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court said Monday that it will hear from oil and gas companies trying to block lawsuits seeking to hold the industry liable for billions of dollars in damage linked to climate change.\n\nThe conservative-majority court agreed to take up a case from Boulder, Colorado, one of multiple lawsuits alleging the companies deceived the public about how fossil fuels contribute to climate change.\n\nGovernments around the country have sought damages totaling billions of dollars, arguing it's necessary to help pay for rebuilding after wildfires, rising sea levels and severe storms worsened by climate change. The lawsuits come amid a wave of legal actions in California, Hawaii and New Jersey and worldwide seeking to leverage action through the courts.\n\nThe case out of Boulder County will likely have implications for other lawsuits, some of which have been dismissed while others work their way through state courts.\n\nSuncor Energy and ExxonMobil appealed to the Supreme Court after Colorado’s highest court let the Boulder case proceed. The companies argue emissions are a national issue that should be heard in federal court, where similar suits have been tossed out.\n\n“The use of state law to address global climate change represents a serious threat to one of our Nation’s most critical sectors,” attorneys wrote. ExxonMobil said Monday that “climate policy shouldn’t be set through fragmented state‑court actions.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration weighed in to support the companies and urge the justices to reverse the Colorado Supreme Court decision, saying it would mean “every locality in the country could sue essentially anyone in the world for contributing to global climate change.”\n\nTrump, a Republican, criticized the lawsuits in an executive order, and the Justice Department has sought to head some off in court.\n\nAttorneys for Boulder had agued that the litigation is still in early stages and should stay in state court. “There is no constitutional bar to states addressing in-state harms caused by out-of-state conduct, be it the negligent design of an automobile or sale of asbestos,” they wrote.\n\nCity officials said the case was about dealing with problems people are facing in Colorado. “Our case is, fundamentally, about fairness. Boulder is already experiencing the effects of a rapidly warming climate, and the financial burden of adaptation should not fall solely on local taxpayers,\" said Jonathan Koehn, its climate initiatives director.\n\nThe Supreme Court also asked the two sides to present arguments on whether the case is truly ready to be heard by the justices. Arguments are expected in the fall.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court.",

    "fullText": "Zachery Ty Bryan was sentenced to 16 months for a 2024 DUI arrest – his sixth arrest in just five years – after a California judge denied probation as part of a plea deal, according to court records.\n\nThe “Home Improvement” and “Tokyo Drift” actor pleaded guilty at an arraignment hearing in Riverside County, where he acknowledged his prior DUI convictions and an enhancement for driving above a 0.15% blood-alcohol level, TheWrap learned Tuesday.\n\nBryan was credited with 57 days of time served and sentenced to 16 months in county jail. His request for probation was denied.\n\nBryan, a former child actor best known for his role on the ABC sitcom starring Tim Allen, was arrested in Oregon last November. The arrest violated his existing probation, and he was briefly held in Eugene without bail before being released.\n\nBryan had been serving probation from a prior domestic assault conviction. His fiancée, Johnnie Faye Cartwright, was also arrested during the November incident and booked on five charges, including driving under the influence, reckless endangerment and attempted assault.\n\nBryan was also arrested in January 2025 in Myrtle Beach, S.C., on a charge of second-degree domestic violence. In that case, Cartwright, who shares three children with Bryan, told police that he had choked and punched her.\n\nBryan’s sentence came from one of two DUI charges from 2024 – once in February and again in October. In 2023, he was charged with misdemeanor harassment, third-degree robbery and fourth-degree felony assault.\n\nIn 2020, Bryan was arrested in Oregon for allegedly strangling his then-girlfriend at their home.\n\nBryan rose to fame in the 1990s playing Brad Taylor on “Home Improvement.” His film credits include “True Heart” and “The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.” He also appeared in the Netflix series “The Guardians of Justice,” which debuted in 2022.\n\nThe post ‘Home Improvement’ and ‘Tokyo Drift’ Star Zachery Ty Bryan Sentenced to 16 Months in DUI Plea Deal appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United climbed into the Premier League top four with a hard-earned 1-0 victory over Everton, as Benjamin Sesko’s second-half strike proved decisive at the Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\nMichael Carrick’s side arrived knowing that three points would move them above Chelsea, and they delivered in a contest short on quality but rich in significance.\n\nUnited began brightly and almost took an early lead when Amad Diallo’s low effort was parried by Jordan Pickford before James Tarkowski cleared off the line.\n\nEverton responded with energy but struggled to carve out clear openings against a disciplined visiting back line.\n\nJames Garner tested Senne Lammens with a dipping free-kick before the interval, yet clear-cut chances remained limited.\n\nThe first half was defined by intensity rather than incision, with both sides cancelling each other out in midfield.\n\nEverton started the second period with greater urgency and Harrison Armstrong forced a sharp save from Lammens inside the opening minute.\n\nUnited gradually regained composure and Bryan Mbeumo spurned a promising opportunity when he volleyed over from close range.\n\nCarrick turned to his bench just before the hour mark, introducing Sesko in search of greater penetration.\n\nThe substitution proved decisive 13 minutes later with a swift counter-attacking move.\n\nMatheus Cunha initiated the break with a forward pass into space for Mbeumo, who drove at the retreating defence.\n\nMbeumo waited for support and delivered a precise ball into the path of Sesko, who had sprinted from deep.\n\nThe Slovenian striker applied a composed first-time finish beyond Pickford to register his eighth goal of the season.\n\nEverton pushed forward in response and Michael Keane unleashed a powerful effort that was tipped over by Lammens.\n\nThe hosts continued to press in the closing stages but United defended resolutely to preserve their narrow advantage.\n\nSesko had an opportunity to add a second late on but failed to control cleanly when sent through on goal.\n\nThe final whistle confirmed a vital away win that strengthens United’s Champions League ambitions.\n\nCarrick’s men now sit fourth, overtaking Chelsea and building momentum at a crucial stage of the campaign.\n\nThe defeat extends Everton’s frustrating run at home and leaves them searching for consistency.\n\nSesko’s timely intervention once again proved the difference in a tightly contested encounter for United.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Cleveland Browns could be preparing to move on from Shedeur Sanders as their starting quarterback.\n\nSanders started seven games for the Browns in 2025, and though he showed potential by posting a 3-4 record, it looks like Cleveland doesn't plan on heading into 2026 with the Colorado product as QB1.\n\nAccording to Mary Kay Cabot of Cleveland.com, the Browns are targeting Green Bay Packers free agent quarterback Malik Willis. The franchise also has interest in Alabama signal-caller Ty Simpson in April's draft.\n\n\"Packers backup quarterback Malik Willis and Alabama’s Ty Simpson are among the external quarterbacks on the Browns’ radar with the NFL Combine kicking off Tuesday and free agency starting in two weeks,\" Cabot said.\n\nSigning Willis would be a savvy move by general manager Andrew Berry.\n\nWillis has done a terrific job filling in for Jordan Love over the last two seasons, showcasing his efficiency with a 78.7% completion rate on 89 passes with Green Bay.\n\nThe Liberty product possesses a dynamic skillset that head coach Todd Monken can maximize. Monken coached Lamar Jackson with the Baltimore Ravens for three seasons, so he knows a thing or two about working with mobile quarterbacks.\n\nSpotrac projects Willis will land a $71 million contract over two seasons in free agency, an average annual value of $35.5 million.

    "fullText": "Manchester United boss Michael Carrick praised the impact of super-sub Benjamin Sesko after the Slovenian's cool finish earned a 1-0 win at Everton on Monday night.\n\nSesko is yet to start in Carrick's six matches in charge but has come off the bench to net in three of his last four appearances with vital goals.\n\nThe 22-year-old also scored a late winner against Fulham and rescued a point against West Ham deep into stoppage time in United's previous outing.\n\nSesko started the move that led to the winning goal as all of United's £200 million ($270 million) trio of attacking signings last summer combined to great effect.\n\nMatheus Cunha picked out the run of Bryan Mbeumo, who squared for Sesko to slot home his sixth goal in seven appearances since Ruben Amorim was sacked in January.\n\nVictory lifted United into the Premier League's top four, three points clear of Liverpool and Chelsea in the battle for a place in next season's Champions League.\n\n\"It was a ruthless finish, I like the way he put it away with real confidence,\" said Carrick, who has five wins and one draw since taking charge at Old Trafford.\n\n\"Great play from Matheus and Bryan to set it up.

    "title": "Steelers, Vikings, Cardinals named possible landing spots for $71 million quarterback",
    "description": "In an article naming possible landing spots for a projected $71 million quarterback, the Pittsburgh Steelers, Minnesota Vikings and Arizona Cardinals were mentioned.",
    "fullText": "Steelers, Vikings, Cardinals named possible landing spots for $71 million quarterback originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThere are going to be plenty of teams in the market for a quarterback this offseason, and among them could be the Pittsburgh Steelers, Minnesota Vikings and Arizona Cardinals.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, the Steelers still don't have an answer on Aaron Rodgers. If he doesn't come back, the Steelers need to make an addition to a quarterbacks room that would include the unproven Will Howard and backup Mason Rudolph.\n\nThe Vikings have J.J. McCarthy under contract, but he failed to cement himself as the team's locked-in starter for the long haul after a poor second season. As a result, the expectation is the Vikings are going to at least add veteran competition.\n\nAs for the Cardinals, it appears Kyler Murray's days are numbered. If he is shown the door, we would bet Arizona won't be keen on staking its future to the Jacoby Brissett wagon, no matter how well he played in 2025.\n\nOne quarterback who could be the most coveted in free agency is Green Bay Packers signal-caller Malik Willis. On SI's Ethen Hutton believes the Steelers, Cardinals and Vikings are all possible landing spots for him.\n\n\"Willis projects to be a sound fit in Minnesota’s talented offense under quarterback-friendly coach Kevin O’Connell. Monitoring his fantasy football outlook, his stock would take a sizable leap with Jefferson and Addison on the perimeter,\" Hutton said of Willis to the Vikings. \"His consistency as a passer will help elevate the Vikings’ offense, with significant upside among fantasy entering the 2026 season. His rushing upside will also pair well with the likes of Aaron Jones and Jordan Mason in the run game, bolstering the rushing attack.\"\n\n\"In Pittsburgh, Willis would join an offense featuring DK Metcalf and a talented tight end trio featuring the likes of Pat Freiermuth, Darnell Washington and Jonnu Smith,\" he said of Willis to Pittsburgh. \"He’d also add a new dynamic to the Steelers’ backfield tandem of Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell. From a fantasy football perspective, his stock would take a sizable leap in Pittsburgh, filling the team’s need for a franchise quarterback. His outlook is highly encouraging for fantasy managers as Willis gears up for his first season as a starter.\"\n\n\"Willis fits Arizona’s offense system under new head coach Mike LaFleur, the brother of Packers head coach Matt LaFleur, as the team looks to bring in another mobile quarterback,\" Hutton said of the Liberty product going to Arizona. \"From a fantasy football standpoint, the Cardinals offer one of the best supporting casts of any team on our list, bolstering Willis’ fantasy stock immensely for the 2026 season. With Willis set to take over a starting job, he’s slated to break out in fantasy football next season. The Cardinals’ weapons could help Willis emerge as one of fantasy’s top quarterbacks next season, with additional upside as a rusher in LaFleur’s offense.\"\n\nA former third-round pick of the Tennessee Titans, Willis looked like he was going to be a bust after two years in the NFL. Then, a trade to the Packers changed everything.\n\nWillis didn't see a ton of action while serving as Jordan Love's backup, but he no doubt made the most of his opportunities and looked like a completely different quarterback than the one we saw in Nashville.\n\nHe showed he can make all the throws, and with accuracy, and his decision-making and pocket presence was top notch. As an added bonus, Willis has plus-athleticism to escape the rush.\n\nWillis doesn't come without some risk, though.\n\nWe believe Willis will command something close to what Spotrac projects, which is a two-year, $71 million contract. That might seem crazy for a guy with just six career starts, but he should enough promise to warrant that kind of money.\n\nEssentially Sports' Tony Pauline reports that many around the league believe Willis is going to end up with the Cardinals, so Arizona is a realistic possibility, assuming they do indeed cut or trade Murray.\n\nThe Steelers' interest in Willis will depend upon what happens with Rodgers, but if the future Hall of Famer doesn't return, we believe Pittsburgh would be willing to take a swing on Willis.\n\nWhen it comes to the Vikings, reports suggest they would like to sign a veteran quarterback, but we would not rule Minnesota out from pursuing Willis if head coach Kevin O'Connell believes he can be an upgrade over McCarthy.\n\nKyle Pitts rumor is bad news for Giants, Commanders, Eagles, Broncos\n\nFalcons rumor could lead to trade with Steelers, Dolphins or Jets\n\nMaxx Crosby rumor gives Bills, Cowboys, Eagles, Pats minimum trade price\n\nRumor from NFL Network reveals Browns' interest in top free agent\n\nCardinals believed to be most likely landing landing spot for $71M QB",

    "fullText": "Fairhope (Ala.) St. Michael Catholic four-star quarterback Gunner Rivers is following in his father’s legendary footsteps.\n\nThe son of former NFL star and future Hall of Famer Philip Rivers has committed to NC State, choosing to join the Wolf Pack 26 years after his father did back in 2000. Gunner chose NC State over reported offers from Auburn, Georgia, Miami, Boston College and more.\n\nOne of the top quarterbacks nationally in the 2027 class, Rivers has long been thought of as a lean to the school where his father won ACC Player of the Year honors in 2003 and Rivers broke almost every NC State and ACC passing record.\n\nGunner himself has had a record-breaking high school career and is coming off a junior season where he completed 208 of 290 passes (72%) for 2,813 yards, 44 touchdowns and just five interceptions. In the process, he led St. Michael Catholic to a 13-1 record and an appearance in the state title game vs. powerhouse Jackson.\n\nStanding in at 6’3 and 200 pounds, he ranks as the nation’s No. 117 overall prospect and No. 12 quarterback, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, an equally weighted average that utilizes all three major recruiting services.\n\nHe also ranks as the No. 4 player from the state of Alabama this cycle.\n\nRivers is undoubtedly one of NC State’s biggest football recruiting wins in program history. His pledge gives head coach Dave Doeren and the Wolfpack four commits early on in the 2027 cycle.\n\nRivers joins Homerville (Ga.) Clinch County three-star safety Kamarion Johnson, Raleigh (N.C.) Cardinal Gibbons three-star tight end Griffin Cockerham and Southeast Raleigh three-star running back Christian Freeman.\n\nLast cycle, NC State signed the nation’s No. 46 class, according to the Rivals Industry Team Recruiting Rankings. It’s early, but the addition of Rivers could provide the Wolfpack with some serious recruiting momentum heading into the spring.\n\nNC State has not signed a top-25 class in the internet recruiting era. It’s highest-ranked haul came in the 2008 cycle, when it landed the No. 26 class that was headlined by four-star QB Mike Glennon.",

    "fullText": "Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao made boxing history in 2015.\n\nMore than a decade later, the two boxing legends are hoping to do it again.\n\nThe two will fight in a professional rematch Sept. 19. The event, which will be streamed live on Netflix, will be the first boxing match to be held at the Las Vegas Sphere.\n\nThe first time around, Mayweather defeated Pacquiao by unanimous decision on May 2, 2015, in the so-called \"Fight of the Century\" at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.\n\n\"I already fought and beat Manny once,\" Mayweather said in a statement released by Netflix. \"This time will be the same result.”\n\nThat fight generated 4.6 million pay-per-view buys and a live gate of $72 million, both of which are still records.\n\nIt was a long-awaited matchup between two of the biggest names in the boxing world — 38-year-old Mayweather (47-0, 26 KO) and 36-year-old Pacquiao (57-5-2, 38 KO) — that ultimately earned Mayweather the World Boxing Council, World Boxing Assn. and World Boxing Organization welterweight titles.\n\nThe backdrop to this year's bout is a bit different. Mayweather is now 50-0 (27 KO) and will be 49 on Tuesday. He has retired and unretired multiple times but has not fought in a bout that counts since his 10-round technical knockout of Conor McGregor in 2017.\n\nAlthough he still has an exhibition fight against Mike Tyson coming up on a still-unannounced date this spring, Mayweather announced last week that he is resuming his professional fighting career.\n\nPacquiao, 47, is 62-9-2 (39 KO). In July, he lost by majority draw to WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios in an attempt to break his own record for oldest welterweight champion. He was 40 when he defeated Keith Thurman for the title in 2019.\n\nPacquiao recently announced a a 10-round welterweight exhibition against former junior welterweight world champion Ruslan Provodnikov on April 18 at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas.\n\n\"Floyd and I gave the world what remains the biggest fight in boxing history,\" Pacquiao said in a statement released by Netflix. \"The fans have waited long enough — they deserve this rematch, and it will be even bigger now that it will be streamed live globally on Netflix. I want Floyd to live with the one loss on his professional record and always remember who gave it to him.\"\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Everton 0-1 Manchester United: Super-sub Sesko scored from the bench for the third time in four games as he finished off a devastating counter-attack",
    "fullText": "When Manchester United were looking for a saviour this season, they opted not to revert to their greatest super-sub. They may not have Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in the dugout but they seem to have his successor in spirit on the pitch. Benjamin Sesko is yet to start a game under Michael Carrick but he has come off the bench to score three times, all significant, delivering an extra five points.\n\nFirst the winner against Fulham, then an equaliser at West Ham, now a decider at Everton. It was early by Sesko’s standards – in the 71st minute, rather than injury time, when Jordan Pickford denied him a second – but it felt further evidence of Carrick’s nous. United had looked blunt before his arrival, lacking inspiration and a focal point in attack. Sesko is the only pure No 9 in the squad and, once again, he illustrated the merits of a penalty-box presence. In time, Carrick may have an issue if he can keep naming Sesko on the bench. For now, their alliance is benefiting both. Carrick said: “I have got a really good relationship with Ben. He has taken some huge steps recently.”\n\nIn a game low on drama, the goal came from a sweeping move. Everton, who had been the more positive in the second half, may regret committing too many men forward, leaving themselves open to the counter-attack which, whether under Carrick or Solskjaer, tends to be United’s most potent weapon.\n\nSesko was involved twice in a move that involved their three big summer signings. He laid the ball off to Matheus Cunha, who sprayed a diagonal pass to release Bryan Mbeumo. He was confronted only by Michael Keane and squared the ball for Sesko, who had run 70 yards to slide in a shot. “It was a ruthless finish,” said Carrick. “I like the way he put it away with real confidence.” It was the Slovenian’s eighth goal for United. He only had two in 17 games when Ruben Amorim was sacked.\n\nAnd United have been transformed since then. They took their haul under Carrick to 16 points from a possible 18, a charge that is putting them on a path towards the Champions League. A distinctly mundane match nevertheless produced a fine result for United.\n\nArguably, they undid some of the damage done on one of Amorim’s most ignominious nights. In November, his United were clueless when confronted with the 10 men of Everton and lost at Old Trafford. The rematch was different and not just because Idrissa Gueye completed the evening without slapping a teammate. Unlike Amorim, Carrick found a way. Successful substitutions have been a theme of his reign, and not just those involving Sesko.\n\nFor one of his predecessors, it was a frustrating reunion. David Moyes has now seen Everton go seven games without a win at Hill Dickinson Stadium. They are yet to record a win over elite opposition at their deluxe ground and, when they were looking more ambitious than United, they conceded.\n\nThey had rarely threatened to in the preceding hour. They almost struck early, when James Tarkowski cleared Amad Diallo’s fourth-minute shot off the line, though Pickford had taken some of the sting out of it. Thereafter, Diogo Dalot thudded a long-range half-volley into the advertising hoardings while, after the break, Mbeumo blazed a shot over from an acute angle.\n\nIf the first half had seemed a contest to give the ball away most, United could savour the earthy qualities that earned them a result. “I'm delighted with the result and spirit, the boys digging deep and sacrificing for each other,” said Carrick. He played his own part. They had too little threat on either flank, so he removed Amad, brought on Sesko and recalibrated his side.\n\nMoyes, of course, did not have a £73m striker in reserve; or in the team, for that matter. “The quality you are talking about costs big money,” he lamented.\n\nThe cheaper striker he does have, Thierno Barry, could have scored inside 10 seconds, albeit without knowing much about it, when Senne Lammens slammed a clearance into him. After that, the Belgian impressed rather more. “Senne was outstanding tonight,” said Carrick. “As a goalkeeper you couldn’t hope for much more: safe hands, calm, composed, an exemplary performance.”\n\nLammens held on to James Garner’s well-struck free kick, saved from Harrison Armstrong less than 30 seconds into the second half and, as Everton chased an equaliser, tipped away Keane’s thunderbolt from distance and thwarted the replacement Tyrique George in injury time. “Their goalie was bloody brilliant,” said Moyes, who nominated Lammens as his man of the match. Everton had directed a series of corners under the bar. They had not realised Lammens would deal with them so well, Moyes reflected ruefully.\n\nWith three summer signings combining for the goal, a fourth excelling in goal, it felt a triumph of United’s recruitment. Of players and, more recently, a head coach.",

    "fullText": "The NFL Competition Committee has discussed a change to the league's rules that would allow replay officials throw penalty flags for fouls that went unpunished on the field.\n\nNFL executive vice president of football operations Troy Vincent said on Monday that the conversation centered on non-football acts that were unpenalized by on-field officials. Vincent cited Seahawks cornerback Josh Jobe striking Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs during Super Bowl LX and Seahawks linebacker Derick Hall stepping on Rams guard Kevin Dotson during the regular season as plays that could be addressed by the change. Jobe was fined for his act and Hall was suspended for one game, but neither was penalized during the game.\n\n\"You don't want to just be expanding the Pandora’s box, but we believe that things like the non-football act, you can really, really restrict what that is,\" Vincent said, via ESPN.com. \"That's something that we believe that potentially there's a little bit of tweaking in the language, that may be the first step.\"\n\nIf the league moves forward with this change, there will likely be more questions in the future about allowing replay officials to make calls on other clear penalties that are missed on the field.",

    "description": "Connelly Early returned this spring sporting an additional 15 pounds of muscle. Monday gave him a chance to try out his new physique on the mound.",
    "fullText": "PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. — Some pitchers go home for the winter with instructions about how to add a new pitch or refine an old one.\n\nThe Red Sox liked what they saw of him in September, and trusted him enough to give him the ball for Game 3 of the Wild Card round in Yankee Stadium.\n\nInstead, the organization advised Early last fall to focus on getting bigger and stronger.\n\nUnlike his closest friend on the team, Payton Tolle, Early doesn’t have the classic power pitcher build. And in order to maximize his stuff and maintain it deeper into outings, the Red Sox wanted him to concentrate on his body.\n\nThere was a revamped diet to start with, and lots of time in the weight room .\n\n“I think we challenged him,” said manager Alex Cora, “and he did (get bigger). I think he added 15 pounds. He’s a lot stronger. That’s going to help him raise the floor on his fastball, maintain the fastball throughout his outings. If he can accomplish that, it’s going to be fun. It was fun last year.”\n\nEarly’s fifth big league start came on the biggest postseason stage imaginable and he showed his poise by not wilting. Early fanned six in 3.2 innings in an elimination game for his team and though he was charged with three earned runs, that was misleading as the team committed several misplays behind him.\n\n“It was a great experience, one that’s going to make him better for his career,” said Cora. “He didn’t care (about the pressure). From the anthem all the way through when he took him out, he was under control.”\n\nEarly’s first major league spring training officially got underway Monday with two scoreless innings against the Tampa Bay Rays at Charlotte Sports Park. He faced seven hitters, and retired six, charged with only a walk.\n\n“I felt good today,” said Early after a 2-1 Red Sox defeat. “Body felt good. I felt comfortable out there. Hopefully, a byproduct of (the added muscle and strength) is the velo ticking up. I think it was in a pretty good spot today, so hopefully, that continues to go up.”\n\nEarly said he didn’t feel much differently on the mound with the added bulk and doesn’t want to obsess about radar gun readings this spring.\n\n“If we’re getting swing-and-misses on (the fastball) and we’re getting some chase,” he said, “it’s a good enough pitch. I’m not too worried about the velo. Honestly, it’s more about holding the floor of the velo at a good spot and feeling good and being able to bounce back from starts.”\n\nThe real test will come later in camp, when Early gets out to five and six innings and discovers whether he’s able to keep the velocity up after 75 or so pitches.\n\nIn the meantime, the Red Sox will want to see Early refine his approach on the mound to pay attention to details: monitoring his tempo, keeping baserunners close and other less obvious facets of the game.\n\n“Polish,” concluded Cora. “He has a good understanding of what he needs to do. His secondary pitches play at this level; they did last year. But there’s more. There’s some progression. He’s not a final product. The physical aspect of it is going to benefit him.”\n\nFenway Insider: Connelly Early makes Grapefruit League debut for Red Sox\n\nRed Sox newcomer given honorable mention on MLB insider’s Top 10 third basemen list\n\nRed Sox reliever wants first baseball card — and to solidify himself as big leaguer in Year 5\n\nAlex Cora’s shout out gave Boston Red Sox trade acquisition ‘more energy’\n\nRed Sox lineup includes players competing for Opening Day roster spots",

    "fullText": "The Buffalo Bills announced that they have re-signed defensive tackle Phidarian Mathis. The former second-round pick agreed to a one year contract. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nStaying in Buffalo ‼️\n\nWe have re-signed OL Alec Anderson and DT Phidarian Mathis each to one year contracts.\n\n— Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) February 23, 2026\n\nMathis, who will turn 28 in April, was chosen 47th overall by the Washington Commanders in the 2022 NFL Draft. He spent three injury-plagued seasons with the club, totaling just 25 tackles and two tackles for loss across only 23 games. Washington released him in December 2024, and he signed with the New York Jets’ practice squad. He did not appear in a game for Gang Green, and he was released in August 2025.\n\nMathis signed with Buffalo’s practice squad on September 10, 2025. The Bills elevated him for two contests—a 23-20 loss to the New England Patriots in Week Five and a 28-21 win over the Kansas City Chiefs in Week Eight—before signing him to their 53-man roster on November 5. Mathis played in four more games during the regular season, and in two of them, he was a huge contributor. He had four tackles in victories over the Cleveland Browns and the New York Jets. Overall, he showed good burst and solid anchor against the run, totaling 13 tackles in his six regular season games.\n\nMathis also played six snaps in the Bills’ Wild Card victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. At 6’4” and 312 lbs. with 34.5” arms, he profiles as someone who can play multiple spots along an odd-man defensive line, which is the scheme the Bills will utilize under new defensive coordinator Jim Leonhard. Coming out of Alabama, NFL Network’s Lance Zierlein called him a “scheme-versatile player” who could play nose tackle in either an odd front or an even front, or a 5-tech defensive end in a 3-4 scheme. Zierlein’s professional comparison for Mathis was DaQuan Jones, Buffalo’s top 1-tech defensive tackle for the last four seasons.\n\nNews had previously leaked regarding Buffalo re-signing offensive lineman Alec Anderson, and the Bills officially announced his signing in the same release announcing the Mathis contract.",

    "description": "Two of the top offensive players in this year's free agent class may not hit the open market. Here's how that'll impact the rest of free agency.",
    "fullText": "Free agency is weeks away but two major players might not be at the negotiating table.\n\nTight end Kyle Pitts and wide receiver George Pickens are the major prizes of free agency on offense. Teams besides the Atlanta Falcons and Dallas Cowboys, respectively, could be out of luck for negotiating with them.\n\nAtlanta is reportedly using the franchise tag on Pitts and Cowboys co-owner Stephen Jones inferred that was likely for Pickens as well.\n\n“I wouldn’t put any timeframe (on a contract),” Jones told reporters. “Once you have a tag, you have a tag. We know George is going to be here.”\n\nThe franchise tag is a tool teams can use to prevent one player per year from reaching free agency. The tag is a one-year, fully guaranteed contract calculated using other salaries at the position.\n\nIt prevents the player from securing a longer-term deal from another team at the cost of a fully guaranteed salary.\n\nNon-quarterbacks rarely play a season with the franchise tag. Instead, it's often used as a tool to keep the player at the negotiating table for their original team for longer. Jones' quote points to the Cowboys using the franchise tag to keep Pickens in the building to iron out a contract before the start of 2026. If not, he'll play the season on that one-year deal.\n\nHere's what it means for the rest of free agency at their positions if Pickens and Pitts aren't free to negotiate league-wide:\n\nPickens is by far the top wide receiver available in this free-agent class. Second-team All-Pro wide receivers rarely are available - especially ones who haven't hit their second contract yet. That's why the Cowboys are motivated to keep him in-house.\n\nIf Pickens stays with Dallas, that moves all of the other free agents up a spot in the rankings and with it likely a bump in pay.\n\nFellow 2022 draftees Alec Pierce and Rashid Shaheed will become the top free agents at wide receiver. Both offer excellent speed on the outside and Shaheed's a dynamic threat in the return game. Jauan Jennings offers a more possession-based skillset but could get a bump in salary with Pickens off the market as well.\n\nHere's the top 10 free agent wide receivers by projected average annual value (AAV) of their future contracts after Pickens, per Spotrac:\n\nJauan Jennings, San Francisco 49ers: $22.61 million\n\nAlec Pierce, Indianapolis Colts: $20.24 million\n\nWan'dale Robinson, New York Giants: $17.64 million\n\nDeebo Samuel, Washington Commanders: $15.77 million\n\nTyreek Hill, Miami Dolphins: $15.07 million\n\nRashid Shaheed, Seattle Seahawks: $14.12 million\n\nMike Evans, Tampa Bay Buccaneers: $13.31 million\n\nRomeo Doubs, Green Bay Packers: $12.00 million\n\nKeenan Allen, Los Angeles Chargers: $6.81 million\n\nHollywood Brown, Kansas City Chiefs: $5.5 million\n\nPitts has draft pedigree as the No. 4 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, as well as recent production with his second-team All-Pro award in 2025.\n\nLike Pickens, there's a mix of options beyond him at the position, either veterans or second-contract players. Teams will have to decide if they value more youth or production at the position with handing out money in this free-agent cycle. Without Pitts, there's a chance the other players have a chance to make more money but the overall tight end market isn't on the same level as wide receiver. Teams aren't as willing to spend big on the position in the same way.\n\nHere's a look at the top 10 free agents at the position without Pitts, per Spotrac projected AAV:\n\nTravis Kelce, Kansas City Chiefs: $10.77 million\n\nDavid Njoku, Cleveland Browns: $9.99 million\n\nIsaiah Likely, Baltimore Ravens: $8.81 million\n\nChig Okonkwo, Tennessee Titans: $7.96 million\n\nCade Otton, Tampa Bay Buccaneers: $7.91 million\n\nDallas Goedert, Philadelphia Eagles: $6.00 million\n\nTyler Higbee, Los Angeles Rams: $5.35 million\n\nTyler Conklin, Los Angeles Chargers: $3.33 million\n\nNoah Fant, Cincinnati Bengals: $3.22 million\n\nDarren Waller, Miami Dolphins: $3.21 million\n\nAll the NFL news on and off the field.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs aren't expected to have a down season again, as they did in 2025.

    "fullText": "Girona earned a point at Mendizorrotza after drawing 2-2 against Deportivo Alavés in an intense match that was decided in the final moments. Míchel's team managed to respond to the initial blow from the Basques but saw the victory slip away in the 89th minute.\n\nThe match started off difficult for the Girona side. In the 5th minute, Boyé put Alavés ahead, taking advantage of a quick action inside the box that caught the visiting defense off guard. The early goal forced Girona to take control of the game and patiently look for their scoring opportunities.\n\nThe response came in the 31st minute. Vanat finished off a set-piece play after a corner to restore balance and reward the growing dominance of the red-and-whites. The goal gave Míchel's team confidence, and they ended the first half with better sensations and control of the ball.\n\nIn the second half, Girona made a decisive step forward. With more presence in the opponent's half and a more vertical passing game, the Catalans found their reward in the 73rd minute. Ounahi, returning to action after the Africa Cup of Nations and his injury, showcased his quality and assisted Tsygankov with a precise pass that the winger coolly converted into a 1-2 lead.\n\nJust as Girona was on the verge of securing three points, a cold shower arrived. In the 89th minute, Boyé scored his second goal, capitalizing on a shot inside the box to make it 2-2. It was an excessive punishment for a Girona side that had managed to come back and created the clearest chances to win the match.\n\nDespite the final disappointment, the point leaves Girona in eleventh place in the standings, with the good news of Ounahi's return, who was instrumental in the second goal. Next Sunday, March 1st, at 9:00 PM, Girona will host Celta de Vigo at Montilivi.",

    "description": "The Braves may not make any starting pitching additions.",
    "fullText": "The Atlanta Braves were linked to a number of starting pitchers this past offseason. They ultimately did not upgrade their rotation, though. After it was recently announced that both Spencer Schwellenbach and Hurston Waldrep are dealing with injuries, rumors began to swirl once again. According to MLB insider Ken Rosenthal, however, the Braves are not interested in two of the top remaining starting pitchers in free agency.\n\nThe Braves, among other teams facing starting pitching injuries, don't seem as intrigued by Lucas Giolito or Zack Littell as you'd expect at the moment, says @Ken_Rosenthal. pic.twitter.com/PELbxh9qT0\n\n— Foul Territory (@FoulTerritoryTV) February 23, 2026\n\nRosenthal pointed to the fact that Bryce Elder and Joey Wentz are both out of options. As a result, they would be placed on waivers if demoted to the minor leagues. Rosenthal reports that the Braves \"evidently\" don't believe signing Lucas Giolito or Zack Littell would be worth the possibility of losing Elder and/or Wentz off waivers.\n\n\"They don't feel Giolito and Littell are enough of an upgrade, I guess, over Wentz and Bryce Elder,\" Rosenthal said.\n\n\"Scherzer is also out there,\" Rosenthal added. \"But Scherzer, it looks like, looks like he might be headed back to Toronto.\"\n\nScherzer landing with the Toronto Blue Jays would make sense, as previous reports have echoed a similar sentiment. However, Giolito and Littell remain available.\n\nLittell spent 2025 with the Tampa Bay Rays and Cincinnati Reds. He ended up making a total of 32 starts, pitching to a 3.81 ERA. He'd be a good depth starter for a number of ball clubs.\n\nGiolito pitched well with the Boston Red Sox a season ago. He recorded a 3.41 ERA across 26 starts.\n\nThe fact that both starters remain un-signed is surprising. One has to imagine they will land a deal sooner rather than later, but it apparently won't be with the Braves unless Atlanta changes its approach.\n\nIt is worth noting that Elder was an All-Star in 2023. He has not been the same pitcher since, as he recorded a 5.30 ERA in 2025. Wentz spent time with the Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates and Minnesota Twins last year, finishing the campaign with a 5.60 ERA across 39 total appearances (13 starts).\n\nElder has displayed signs of potential in the past and Wentz offers versatility given his ability to start or pitch in relief, but not signing Giolito or Littell because Elder and Wentz don't have options would obviously be a questionable move. It would be different if Atlanta was not looking to compete, but the Braves feature an overall talented ball club and would benefit from bringing in at least one more veteran starter amid Schwellenbach and Waldrep's injury concerns.",

    "fullText": "James Harden says he's more than just an NBA player: 'I am a system' originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJames Harden’s most talked-about quote didn’t come after a 50-point night. It came in a press room—and it hasn’t left the conversation since.\n\n“I’m just not a system player; I am a system,” Harden said in 2023.\n\nMORE: Angel Reese serves First Lady teas in fitted Versace\n\nAt the time, the line drew pushback. But in 2026, as detailed in reporting by Brandon “Scoop B” Robinson, the statement reads less like a headline grab and more like a clear explanation of Harden’s role on the floor.\n\nNow with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Harden’s game has shifted from high-volume scoring to full-scale orchestration. Playing alongside Donovan Mitchell, he’s tasked with managing possessions, directing spacing, and creating opportunities before defenses can react.\n\nHarden described what matters most in that role: “Somebody that can have that dialogue with me and understand and move forward and figure out and make adjustments on the fly throughout the course of games, that’s all I really care about. It’s not about me scoring.”\n\nThat approach has defined Cleveland’s structure. With frontcourt options like Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen, Harden’s ability to process the floor in real time has become central to how the offense functions. Instead of operating within a set system, he dictates it—controlling tempo, reading coverages, and forcing defensive shifts.\n\nSpeaking with Robinson, Harden compared that responsibility to elite NFL quarterbacks, pointing to Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, Lamar Jackson, and Patrick Mahomes.\n\n“The greats,” Harden said. “All those guys have decisions to make in every possession… It’s a split second.”\n\nMORE: Devin Booker shades Bad Bunny Halftime performance: 'I'm Mexican'\n\nThe comparison highlights how Harden views the game. Each possession begins with a read—defender positioning, help coverage, timing—and ends with a decision. Whether it’s a pass to a rolling big or a kick-out to a shooter, the outcome is shaped by those initial reads.",

    "description": "Cleveland Browns starting S Ronnie Hickman is a restricted free agent, Kamren Curl could fill is role in free agency",
    "fullText": "The 2026 free agent list for the Cleveland Browns is a sad sight. There are plenty of guys that GM Andrew Berry could have signed to extensions during this past season, but did not. And now, these talented players are headed to the free agency period, which begins March 9.\n\nOne name really stands out: Safety Ronnie Hickman.\n\nIn the Browns’ defensive back room, the following are listed on the free agent list: S Rayshawn Jenkins, CB M.J. Emerson, CB Tre Avery, CB Sam Webb, CB D’Angelo Ross, CB Anthony Kendall, and Hickman. Webb is a restricted free agent, whereas Kendall is an exclusive rights free agent.\n\nHickman is also a restricted free agent. This means a player who has three accrued seasons with an expired contract. He can negotiate with other NFL clubs, subject to “tender offers” from his original team. Cleveland would have the right of first refusal to match any offer sheet.\n\nIf Hickman leaves, or if Berry does not re-sign him before free agency begins, there is trouble in paradise with the safety room. Grant Delpit is the other starter, along with the youngster Donovan McMillon and journeyman Chris Edmonds.\n\nKamren Curl could come in and become the Day 1 starter for the Browns.\n\nThere are plenty of very good safeties in all rounds of the April NFL draft, including Ohio State’s Caleb Downs, who is ranked the #5 prospect in this year’s NFL draft. The Browns are picking at #6, so that is a huge possibility for Cleveland.\n\nHowever, Berry might have his sights on another player and hopes that the draft falls his way. Waiting to see where Downs goes is not prudent. Berry should consider bringing in another safety from free agency first.\n\nBerry is a former college cornerback, so he has always provided the defensive back room with plenty of talent and developmental players. This group is Berry’s pet project.\n\nThis past NFL season, the Browns ranked #4 in the league in defense. Break that down into the #3 passing defense and the #16 rushing defense, so the importance of pass coverage with Cleveland’s defense has been a huge focus.\n\nNFL draft: 2020 Round 7, pick #216 (Commanders)\n\n2025 season: 17 starts, 122 tackles, 2 QB hits, 2 sacks, 2 interceptions, 5 batted passes, 4 pressures, 2 hurries, 0 knockdowns, 2 tackles for loss, 1 forced fumble, 0 fumble recoveries, 0 batted passes, 7 missed tackles, 47 receptions allowed, 1,112 defensive snaps (99%), 46 special teams snaps (10%)\n\n586 career tackles in just six seasons. Had a career high this past season with 122 and had 115 in 2023. Very durable and has missed very few games. 93 games played with 86 NFL starts, so he has the experience. His vertical jump is 34.5.”\n\nHe is a versatile defensive back with underrated coverage abilities and has zero issues coming up and supporting the run-stopping game. He is known across the league as one of the league’s best run-stopping safeties.\n\nBut Curl’s talents don’t just stop with large tackling numbers. He can play free safety, box, lined up at strong safety in college, and play linebacker in the 4-2-5. He is a good blitzer and lends a hand at cornerback if needed.\n\nHe is a reliable tackler with just seven missed tackles this past year. Curl excels at closing on the ball and understands passing lanes. Very good instincts and productive.\n\nCurl does lack elite speed, which is a reason why he doesn’t line up at cornerback. And at times his angle pursuit is off, which results in additional yardage gained. His backpedal is smooth and even.\n\nRuns the alley with adequate effort to free himself from blockers. Reads combinations and comes out clean as deep safety.\n\nHe is good on kickoff teams as well, so he comes with special teams value. He was paid $9 million on a two-year deal with the Rams.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Detroit Lions and Las Vegas Raiders are predicted to pull off a trade involving two players, including edge rusher Max Crosby.\n\nBleacher Report's Alex Ballentine's trade proposal sends Crosby to the Lions and cornerback Terrion Arnold to the Raiders.\n\nThe hypothetical trade would also have Las Vegas acquiring the No. 17 overall pick in April's draft and a 2027 second-round pick:\n\n\"The Lions make a lot of sense as a team that has lost momentum as a contender, though.

The young corner played just eight games in 2025 due to a shoulder injury, but when healthy, he's a solid starter who will only get better.\n\nHowever, giving up Arnold to land a game-changer like Crosby is a no-brainer for the Lions. Crosby is one of the best players in football, tallying three double-digit sack seasons in the past four years.\n\nDespite all the trade speculation, Crosby will likely remain in Las Vegas this season, but if he does request a trade and gets moved by the Raiders, the Lions should be a top landing spot, especially if Detroit fails to re-sign breakout edge rusher Al-Quadin Muhammad in free agency.\n\nRams $44 million cut candidate could land with Bills, Patriots, Steelers\n\nKyle Pitts rumor is bad news for Giants, Commanders, Eagles, Broncos\n\nFalcons rumor could lead to trade with Steelers, Dolphins or Jets\n\nMaxx Crosby rumor gives Bills, Cowboys, Eagles, Pats minimum trade price\n\nRumor from NFL Network reveals Browns' interest in top free agent",

    "title": "What releasing Antonio Gibson means for the Patriots",
    "description": "The veteran running back was let go ahead of NFL free agency.",
    "fullText": "The New England Patriots decided to shake up their running back room on Monday. Antonio Gibson, who originally joined the team on a three-year, $11.25 million free agency deal in 2024, was released after two seasons and 22 total games with the organization.\n\nThe move itself did not come as too big a surprise. Not only was Gibson little more than a rotational option in the Patriots’ backfield with an unclear outlook given that Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson reside atop the depth chart, he also is currently rehabbing a torn ACL suffered in October.\n\nThat said, let’s take a bigger-picture view at what the transaction means from a New England perspective.\n\nThe Patriots entered the offseason with six true running backs under contract for the 2026 season, including Gibson as the projected RB3 behind the aforementioned Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson. With him no longer a piece of the puzzle, one layer of depth has been removed behind the top pair and is leaving the group looking as follows:\n\nRunning back (5): Rhamondre Stevenson (38), TreVeyon Henderson (32), Terrell Jennings (26), Lan Larison (34), Elijah Mitchell (45)\n\nOutside of those six players, the Patriots also have two backfield players headed for free agency. Both running back Deneric Prince and fullback Jack Westover are exclusive rights free agents.\n\nEven if Prince and Westover are retained, the Patriots are lacking established depth or long-term developmental upside behind Stevenson and Henderson. While they project as a formidable one-two punch, no Gibson as the third option means that the team might be on the lookout for another player with a similarly versatile skillset.\n\nBefore tearing his ACL in Week 5 against the Buffalo Bills, Gibson had not just served as the Patriots’ third running back but also their top kickoff return man. As such, he had averaged 28.5 yards on his 12 runbacks and also scored a 90-yard touchdown in Week 2 versus Miami.\n\nOnce Gibson was lost for the year, the Patriots were unable to find similar production and home-run potential. Six other players returned kickoffs for them on the year — running backs Rhamondre Stevenson, TreVeyon Henderson, Terrell Jennings and D’Ernest Johnson as well as wide receivers Kyle Williams and Efton Chism III — but none emerged as a clear featured option.\n\nWith Gibson now officially out of the picture, the competition will start at zero again. Based on flashes, Henderson and Williams seem like the frontrunners at the moment, but there are a lot of factors plus future roster changes that are likely to change that projection.\n\nOne of the reasons why Gibson getting released was no surprise was his contract. Carrying a $4.14 million salary cap number, he was the 21st most-expensive player on the team right now. That in itself might not have been a release-worthy problem, but the structure of the pact invited a change: only his $1 million signing bonus proration for the 2026 season was fully-guaranteed.\n\nThat $1 million will now be added to the Patriots’ dead cap space for 2026. Meanwhile, the team created $2.14 million in net savings: his gross savings of $3.14 million minus another player with a $1 million salary cap number taking his spot on the Top 51 list of contracts to be counted against the cap once the new league year starts in mid-March.\n\nAccording to salary cap expert Miguel Benzan, Gibson’s release now puts the Patriots $44.3 million under a projected league cap of $304.3 million.\n\nConsidering that Gibson was released with a failed physical designation, however, it appears that he qualifies for the NFL’s injury protection benefit. If so and he remains unsigned heading into the new season, the Patriots might be charged $2.1 million against their cap at the start of the regular season. In that case, the financial gains of releasing the 27-year-old would be minimal.\n\nThe Patriots’ 2024 offseason was their first without Bill Belichick presiding over their football operations. So, who was the first free agent added under the new regime led by Eliot Wolf and then-head coach Jerod Mayo? That would be one Mr. Antonio Gibson.\n\nWith Gibson now gone, so is another remnant of the Mayo-era Patriots. In fact, less than 14 months after his firing, only 23 players remain with the team who played under the one-and-done coach as pointed out by Ethan. Hurwitz of Sports Illustrated.\n\nWith Antonio Gibson's release, here's the list of remaining Patriots under contract for 2026 that played under Jerod Mayo:\n\n– Christian Gonzalez\n– DeMario Douglas\n– Kayshon Boutte\n– Drake Maye\n– Marte Mapu\n– Bryce Baringer\n– Dell Pettus\n– Marcus Jones\n– Terrell Jennings\n-…\n\n— Ethan Hurwitz (@HurwitzSports) February 23, 2026\n\nWhile his failed physical might have forced their hand a bit, the Patriots had no real reason to release Gibson now as opposed to closer to the start of free agency on March 11. However, with the entire league embarking on Indianapolis this week for the NFL Scouting Combine, getting cut now allows Gibson a head start of sorts.\n\nSure, teams will be cautious when it comes to a running back who tore his ACL just four months ago, but Gibson’s name is at least out there already and he can start taking visits and undergoing physical examination with other clubs right away. Other veteran running backs who might end up competing against him on the open market might not be in that same position yet.",

    "fullText": "Everton 0 - 1 Manchester United FT\n\nBenjamin Sesko was Manchester United's super-sub for the second match running as the Slovenian scored the only goal against Everton to send Michael Carrick's men clear in fourth spot.\n\nThirteen days after Sesko struck deep in injury time to rescue a point at West Ham, the £73.7m forward applied a clinical first-time finish to a 71st-minute counter-attack that he had started deep in his own half.\n\nSesko kept motoring after laying a pass off to Matheus Cunha. By the time Cunha had delivered a long pass to Bryan Mbeumo, the eager Sesko had outrun Everton's defence and was on hand to stroke home his eighth goal of the season.\n\nRemarkably, only two of those goals came under former boss Ruben Amorim, with three coming in Darren Fletcher's two-game stint in interim charge and three under Carrick, who has now won five of his six games at the helm.\n\nIt was a moment of class that was a long time in coming in a match that was low on quality at Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\nBoth sides struggled against obdurate defences, having gone almost a fortnight without a game after playing early in the last round of matches, late in this one and with no FA Cup game in between after respective early exits.\n\nIn a game of few chances, James Tarkowski cleared off the line in the first half after an effort from Amad was half-saved by Jordan Pickford.\n\nVisiting goalkeeper Senne Lammens denied teenager Harrison Armstrong, who had Everton's best attempt before Michael Keane let fly with a thunderous long-range effort eight minutes from time. The shot was heading towards the top left corner but Lammens was again alert, with the Belgium international tipping the ball over.\n\nThis result means it is now seven home games without a win in all competitions for Everton, who sit ninth.\n\nWhat did you make of Everton’s display?\n\nHave your say on Manchester United's performance\n\nIn six games at the helm, Carrick has made two changes to his starting line-up, both due to injury.\n\nLisandro Martinez missed this one because of a minor calf problem, which meant Leny Yoro had to step in at the back.\n\nHe is backing his players, and he knows there is firepower on the bench too.\n\nWhen United performed as poorly as they had done at West Ham, some critics were already taking to social media to claim the bubble had burst.\n\nHowever, Carrick has trust in Sesko. With less than an hour gone and with little sign of a goal coming, Carrick sent on his towering forward.\n\nHis finish was not as eye-catching as the one at London Stadium, but he held his nerve when it mattered.\n\nSesko should have had a second after he was sent clear by Diogo Dalot as the game entered stoppage time.\n\nIf he had taken it, it would have spared United a few anxious minutes. As it was, he failed to control the ball properly, and England goalkeeper Pickford was able to see off the danger.\n\nSesko's goals in his latest two games could prove priceless as United strive for one of what seem certain to be five Champions League places for English teams.\n\nNot only have United put three points between themselves and Chelsea and Liverpool, who sit fifth and sixth, but they are now only three points behind third-placed Aston Villa, who they entertain at Old Trafford in three games' time.\n\nDavid Moyes wore a look of irritation and frustration as he went to shake hands at the final whistle.\n\nThe Scot knew that for much of the contest his home side had been the equal of the club he once managed.\n\nBut, as has been the case often for Everton, big-spending opponents delivered a moment of quality for which the Toffees had no response.\n\nMoyes has promise in his squad. That was clear when looking at Armstrong, former United midfielder James Garner, who excelled at right-back, and Tyrique George, who was denied by Lammens deep in stoppage time as Everton desperately chased an equaliser.\n\nTarkowski, Pickford and Keane are reliable and experienced. But the elite level depth is not there.\n\nMoyes spoke in his programme notes about chasing targets beyond the ones Everton have recently been used to going after. In recent seasons, their mission has essentially been to deal with a chronic financial situation and stay up.\n\nA new stadium means new ambitions, and there has been no relegation danger this season. But Everton want more than mid-table security.\n\nThe only problem with that is – as Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace are finding out – without sufficient resources, juggling Premier League and European football is a fresh strain on resources than can be exceptionally tough to overcome.\n\nMoyes will keep pushing for those loftier spots in the table because it is his nature, but perhaps the top half and no more would not be a bad outcome for the first campaign away from Goodison Park.\n\nEverton are next in action in the Premier League at Newcastle United on Saturday, 28 February (15:00 GMT). Manchester United entertain Crystal Palace on Sunday, 1 March (14:00 GMT).",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFor many seasons, the Los Angeles Angels moved as Mike Trout did. He was the sole face of the club's offense after Shohei Ohtani signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers, and he has had a difficult time staying healthy.\n\nTrout missed a month of the season in 2025 after suffering a bone bruise in his left knee, the same knee he had surgery on in 2024. After coming back, he was reduced to being used as the primary DH for the club.\n\nAnd while Trout was trying his best to give the Angels all he had, someone else stepped up to be the face of the offense, and that would be outfielder Jo Adell.\n\nMORE: Angels players 'took notice' of owner Arte Moreno's recent comments\n\nMike Trout could only muster up 26 home runs last year, tying him for third place alongside Zach Neto. Taylor Ward would go on to have a great season, hitting 36 home runs, but it was not enough to be the home run leader for the Halos.\n\nThat prize would go to Adell, who hit a career-high 37 home runs last season over the course of 152 games.\n\nWhile he may take a step back this year, Bleacher Report's Joel Reuter believes he can be the home run leader for the Angels once again in 2026.\n\n\"Despite his poor batting average and middling defense, the Angels gave Jo Adell a full runway to prove himself last season. The 26-year-old responded by finishing in fourth on the AL leaderboard with a career-high 37 home runs, and while a potential Mike Trout resurgence looms, Adell now stands as a top-tier power threat.\"\n\nNow, if the Angels can get a healthy and resurging year from Trout, they could be in a much better position than they have been over the last few years.\n\nThe Pirates' home run crown could come down to three new faces\n\nEugenio Suarez returns to Cincinnati to reclaim his home run throne\n\nAnticipating a crowded leaderboard for the Athletics' home run crown\n\nMLB analyst makes the case for Kerry Carpenter to carry Detroit offensively\n\nNew walls and goals for Royals' star Bobby Witt Jr. in Kansas City",

    "fullText": "Thanks to Henri Veesaar's return on Saturday, the UNC basketball team is back in the win column. North Carolina roared ahead midway through the second half on Saturday, downing Syracuse 77-64 and sweeping the season series.\n\nEarlier last week, the Tar Heels lost an embarrassing, 82-58 rivalry battle with NC State. UNC looked overwhelmed from opening tip, with the host Wolfpack (19-8, 10-4 ACC) playing off a rowdy crowd.\n\nNorth Carolina is still in the rankings ahead of Monday night's home clash with Louisville – and a win should further improve its standing. In college basketball analyst Andy Katz' latest Power 37 rankings, the Tar Heels dropped to 29th.\n\nUNC sits between Iowa (28th) and Georgia (30). The Hawkeyes split a pair of ranked games last week, upsetting Nebraska and losing at Wisconsin, while the Bulldogs upset Kentucky and Texas.\n\nNorth Carolina is still awaiting Caleb Wilson's return, but his teammates are stepping up, including unlikely heroes like Zayden High. The Tar Heels' backcourt is still trying to find consistency, but senior captain Seth Trimble is a key behind big games.\n\nNEW #Power37 from @TheAndyKatz 🚨\n\n1. Duke\n2. Arizona\n3. Michigan\n4. St. John's\n5. Houston\n6. UConn\n7. Florida\n8. Gonzaga\n9. Illinois\n10. Iowa State\n\n— NCAA March Madness (@MarchMadnessMBB) February 23, 2026\n\nUNC faces a brutal schedule to end regular season play, starting with the ranked Cardinals (20-7, 9-5 ACC) on Monday night. North Carolina hosts Virginia Tech on Saturday night at 8:30 p.m., Clemson next Tuesday at 7 p.m., then a rematch at Duke on March 7.\n\nThe Tar Heels currently sit in a sixth-place tie with Louisville in the ACC, meaning they'd have a single bye in the ACC Tournament. UNC has an outside chance to clinch the ACC regular season title, but needs the conference-leading Blue Devils (25-2, 13-1 ACC) and others to, essentially, lose out.\n\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: UNC basketball falls to 29th in latest Power 37 rankings",

    "description": "Murray has been sidelined for more than a year with a torn Achilles, but wants to play despite the Pelicans having the second-worst record in the West.",
    "fullText": "Just over a year after he suffered a torn Achilles, New Orleans Pelicans guard Dejounte Murray is ready to return.\n\nMurray, 29, is listed as available on the NBA injury report for Tuesday's matchup with the Golden State Warriors. The nine-year veteran ruptured his Achilles on Jan. 31, 2025, sustaining the injury on a non-contact play versus the Boston Celtics during which he lunged for the ball then immediately fell to the court.\n\n[\nMurray was in his first season with New Orleans after being acquired from the Atlanta Hawks for Dyson Daniels, Larry Nance Jr. and two first-round picks. He also missed 17 games with a broken hand earlier in the season, limiting him to 31 games overall.\n\nThe Pelicans are slogging through a season that has them second-to-last in the Western Conference (and fourth-worst in the NBA) at 16-42. With 24 games remaining, some might question Murray returning. But tanking doesn't serve much purpose for the Pelicans after trading this year's first-round selection to the Hawks to move up to select Derik Queen.\n\n\"I'm not one of those guys like I'm paid, I could get an extra 6-7 months, or our team is 14th in the West. There are a lot of excuses for a chump to say 'I'm not playing'. I am the opposite of that... I want to represent of New Orleans\"\n\n-- Dejounte Murray on New Orleans pic.twitter.com/NOB1LzV3IC\n\n— Pelicans Film Room (@PelsFilmRoom) February 23, 2026\n\n[Get more Pelicans news: New Orleans team feed]\n\nMurray also wants to see some game action after being sidelined for more than a year.\n\n\"I'm here, I love New Orleans, I love the people. This is the reason I'm coming back,\" Murray said to Pelicans Film Room on Monday.\n\n\"I'm not one of those guys like, I'm paid, I could get an extra 6-7 months, or our team is 14th in the West,'\" he added. \"There are a lot of excuses for a chump to say, 'No, I ain't playing.' I am the opposite of that.\"\n\nMurray will likely be on a minutes restriction as he works his way back. Pelicans interim head coach James Borrego didn't say for certain how much Murray might play, but praised him for wanting to get on the court.\n\n\"It speaks to his character, that he cares,\" Borrego said, via the Associated Press. \"I'm not saying that everybody coming off this injury would even play right now. This kid wants to play. He wants to be out there on the floor. He wants to compete. He wants to be out there with his teammates. He wants to win.\"\n\nDuring his eight NBA seasons, Murray has averaged 15.5 points, 5.8 rebounds, 5.4 assists and 1.5 steals per game playing for the San Antonio Spurs, Hawks and Pelicans. He missed the entire 2018-19 season with a torn ACL sustained during the preseason.",

    "fullText": "Kouri Richins, a Utah mom of three and children's book author accused of killing her husband last year, allegedly Googled \"luxury prisons for the rich\" after his death, according to new court documents.\n\nProsecutors say Richins, 33, poisoned her husband, 39-year-old Eric Richins, with fentanyl the evening of March 3, 2022, at their home in Kamas, just outside of Park City, while their three young sons were sleeping.\n\nShe also told police after her husband was found dead that \"he didn't just die in his sleep,\" records reveal.\n\nRichins appeared in court on Monday, when she was denied bail.\n\nUTAH CHILDREN'S BOOK AUTHOR ACCUSED OF MURDERING HUSBAND TOOK OUT $2M IN LIFE INSURANCE PRIOR TO HIS DEATH\n\nNew details of the case were revealed in court records, though, which show that investigators got access to Richins' phone and found various typo-ridden Google searches that they believe may be used as incriminating evidence against the suspect, though her defense team disagrees.\n\nShe apparently searched the following phrases beginning in April 2022: \"luxury prisons for the rich in america,\" \"how long does life insrance companies takento.pay [sic];\" \"can you delete everythjng on an old icloud account [sic],\" \"can deleted text messages be retrieved,\" \"what information can be cbtained from a cellphone [sic],\" \"how to turn find my iphone off [sic],\" \"can cops force you to do a lie detector test,\" \"when does FBI get involved in a case,\" \"what is considered a lethal.dose of fentanyl [sic],\" and \"what are you allowed inside utah jails.\"\n\nUTAH AUTHOR ACCUSED OF MURDEIRNG HUSBAND ALLEGEDLY CAUGHT TRYING TO STEAL HIS LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS\n\nRichins' Google Search history also included a search for her own net worth, various inquiries about ranches for sale in Tennessee and Montana and searches for her husband's family's ties to police in Summit County, Utah.\n\nThe suspect's defense attorney, Skye Lazaro, filed a response to the state's allegations on Sunday, saying her \"search history is merely in response to what was happening with the investigation, not evidence as of guilt as the State asserts.\"\n\nLazaro also pushed for Richins' release on bail \"because there is no substantial evidence to support the charges,\" though a judge on Monday denied bail for the murder suspect.\n\nAmy Richins, Eric’s sister, called her sister-in-law \"desperate, greedy and extremely manipulative\" in a statement read aloud during Richins' Monday bail hearing.\n\n\"How can anyone value human life so cheaply? I cannot comprehend it,\" she said.\n\nUTAH CHILDREN'S BOOK AUTHOR HAD ‘PERFECT’ MARRAIGE WITH HUSBAND BEFORE ALLEGED MURDER: FRIEND\n\nProsecutors allege Richins purchased four different life insurance policies on Eric Richins' life totaling more than $1.9 million between 2015 and 2017. On Jan. 1, 2022, months before his murder, Kouri \"surreptitiously and without authorization changed the beneficiary for Eric's $2 million life insurance policy to herself,\" the document states.\n\nPrior to his death, Eric took Kouri off his will and made his sister the beneficiary instead, according to investigators. His family told authorities he had been in fear for his life after Kouri allegedly tried to poison him once several years ago in Greece and again on Valentine's Day 2022.\n\nUTAH MAN ALLEGEDLY POISONED BY AUTHOR WIFE BELIEVED SHE WAS HAVING AFFAIR: FAMILY SPOX\n\nThe couple was apparently having financial disagreements due to Kouri's wish to purchase a $2 million mansion under construction in Wasatch County. She wanted to flip the mansion and sell it for a profit, a warrant states.\n\nEric apparently thought the home was too expensive, his family told investigators.\n\nUTAH CHILDREN'S BOOK AUTHOR, HUSBAND SPARRED OVER ‘CURSED’ MANSION BEFORE HIS ALLEGED MURDER\n\nKouri, who owns a real estate company, is accused of poisoning Eric with a Moscow Mule spiked with fentanyl, an opioid that is lethal in small doses, while they were celebrating a home sale March 3, 2022. The next day, Kouri allegedly closed a deal on the Wasatch County mansion \"alone,\" after her husband was pronounced dead.\n\nKouri told investigators the morning of March 4, 2022, that she did not know what happened to her husband after calling police to report his death, according to a transcript from police-worn body camera footage taken at the scene of Eric's murder.\n\n\"He didn't just die in his sleep. This is insane,\" she told police at the time.\n\nLater on, after finding out that her children heard their father had died, Kouri Richins apparently said, \"Oh, my God. This can't be happening. This can't be happening. This can't be happening.\"\n\nKouri's defense attorney alleges that Summit County officials did not read Richins her Miranda rights while they questioned her after Eric Richins' death and apparently ignored communication from her counsel. She is arguing that as a result of alleged malpractice, investigators should \"refrain from using the passcode to access Ms. Richins’ cell phone,\" the filing states.\n\nAdditionally, Kouri's defense team is taking issue with testimony from a witness identified as C.L. in court documents, who is currently in prison. C.L. told investigators that she sold fentanyl to Kouri prior to Eric's poisoning death, but Lazaro alleges that C.K. only identified the fentanyl after investigators pushed her to do so after questioning her for over an hour.\n\nAfter Eric's death, Kouri wrote a children's book about death, \"Are You With Me?\"\n\nA description for the book, which was listed on Amazon for $14.99, describes \"Are You With Me?\" as \"a must-read for any child who has experienced the pain of loss, and for parents who want to provide their children with the emotional support they need to heal and grow.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

    "description": "We release Steerling-8B, an 8B-parameter causal diffusion language model that is interpretable by construction — its predictions are routed through concepts you can measure, audit, and control.",
    "fullText": "We are releasing Steerling-8B, the first interpretable model that can trace any token it generates to its input context, concepts a human can understand, and its training data.\nTrained on 1.35 trillion tokens, the model achieves downstream performance within range of models trained on 2–7× more data.\nSteerling-8B unlocks several capabilities which include suppressing or amplifying specific concepts at inference time without retraining, training data provenance for any generated chunk, and inference-time alignment via concept control, replacing thousands of safety training examples with explicit concept-level steering.\n\nFor the first time, a language model, at the 8-billion-parameter scale, can explain every token it produces in three key ways.\nMore specifically, for any group of output tokens that Steerling generates, we can trace these tokens to:\n\nWe are releasing the weights of a base model trained on 1.35T tokens as well as companion code to interact and play with the model.\n\nBelow we show Steerling-8B generating text from a prompt across various categories. You can select an example, then click on any highlighted chunk of the output. The panel below will update to show:\n\nSteerling is built on a causal discrete diffusion model backbone, which lets us steer generation across multi-token tokens rather than only at the next-token.\nThe key design choice is decomposing the model’s embeddings into three explicit pathways: ~33K supervised “known” concepts, ~100K “discovered” concepts the model learns on its own, and a residual that captures whatever remains.\n\nWe then constrain the model with training loss functions that ensure the model routes signal through concepts without a fundamental tradeoff with performance.\nThe concepts feed into logits through a linear path, every prediction decomposes exactly into per-concept contributions, and we can edit those contributions at inference time without retraining.\nFor the full architecture, training objectives, and scaling analysis, see Scaling Interpretable Models to 8B.\n\nDespite being trained on significantly fewer compute than comparable models, Steerling-8B achieves competitive performance across standard benchmarks. The figure below shows average performance (across 7 benchmarks) versus approximate training FLOPs on a log scale, with vertical lines marking multiples of Steerling’s compute budget.\n\nIn the previous update, we shared several ways that assess how interpretable a model’s representations are.\nHere we provide another metric that gives insight into the model’s use of its concepts. On a held-out validation set, over 84% of token-level contribution comes from the concept module: the model is not just using the residual to make its predictions.\nThis matters for control: if the model’s predictions genuinely flow through concepts, then editing those concepts at inference time actually changes what the model does rather than nudging a side channel while the real work happens elsewhere.\n\nA useful check is what happens when we remove the residual pathway. On several LM Harness tasks, dropping the residual has only a small effect, which suggests the model’s predictive signal is largely routed through concepts rather than hidden “everything-else” channels.\n\nFinally, Steerling can detect known concepts in text with 96.2% AUC on a held-out validation dataset.\n\nIn the coming weeks, we’ll be releasing deep dives on each of these capabilities:\n\nWe’ll cover each of these in detail in upcoming posts, with quantitative evaluations and deployment-oriented case studies.",

    "fullText": "Life is complicated. Regardless of what your beliefs or politics or ethics are, the way that we set up our society and economy will often force you to act against them: You might not want to fly somewhere but your employer will not accept another mode of transportation, you want to eat vegan but are at some point in a situation where the best you can do is a vegetarian option.\n\nSometimes it’s not even our hand being forced but us not having the mental strength or priorities to do something: I could just not use WhatsApp because it is owned by Meta but my son’s daycare organizes everything through WhatsApp and do I really want to force my belief on all those very busy parents and caretakers or should I just bite the bullet and use the tool that seems to work for everyone – even though it’s not perfect?\n\nThere are no one-size-fits-all solutions for this: Sometimes a belief or ethic you hold is so integral to you that you will not move. Sometimes they are held loosely enough to let go under certain conditions. There’s a multitude of factors and thoughts that go into those kinds of decisions and at some point you just gotta make a call based on what’s in front of you and your priorities.\n\nWhat I am saying is: We are all doing things we know are not ideal, are either morally questionable or do not align with our values. That’s life. I for example know that consuming meat is problematic for ethical and ecological reasons, I still do it sometimes. I reduce as much as I can but I am far from perfect. Just one of the many examples of my actions not being perfectly and purely aligned with my beliefs.\n\nAnd I am 100% sure each and every reader will have similar experiences. We are imperfect and messy beings. In the end all you can do is actually try to make good decisions based on your values, try to learn from your actions and ideally do better – or at least understand what were the forces that go you to act against your values.\n\nCory Doctorow, probably one of the most influential writers about digital technology and culture celebrated the 6th anniversary of his personal blog pluralistic – congratulations! Cory is quite the phenomenon, I know nobody with his amount of output and his consistency of publication. It is scary just how consistently he writes and published while also churning out books. I do admire his work ethic tremendously.\n\nBut one thing in his celebratory post rubbed me the wrong way and I think it’s worth pointing out. Not for the one specific case but because it highlights a problematic way of thinking that I see a lot in current tech discourse that stands in the way of us actually improving the world.\n\nSo Cory outlines his process of how he publishes to his blog (and then pushes the same writing out to other places). He describes how one QA step in his process is piping his writing through an LLM (using the Ollama software, it’s unclear which open weight LLM he uses) to check for typos and small grammar mistakes. He then points out how some readers might find that problematic:\n\n“Doubtless some of you are affronted by my modest use of an LLM. You think that LLMs are “fruits of the poisoned tree” and must be eschewed because they are saturated with the sin of their origins. I think this is a very bad take, the kind of rathole that purity culture always ends up in.”\n\nUsing LLMs isn’t always popular with the cool crowd, Cory knows that. And he wants to defend his (quite modest) use, which I understand: Nobody likes their problematic behavior being pointed out to them. But as outlined: Life’s complicated. Cory could just have said “I know there are many critiques of LLMs, but right now that is the best way for me to enable my work, I try to limit the problematic aspects by using a small open weight model and checking the results in detail.” and have moved on. But he needed to make a stand. And that stand lead him into the problematic train of thought that I wanted to point out here. Because many, many people listen to him and basically take his word as the gospel. So great power, great responsibility and such.\n\nThe whole argument is based on a strawman. Let’s look at Cory’s words:\n\nLet’s start with some context. If you don’t want to use technology that was created under immoral circumstances or that sprang from an immoral mind, then you are totally fucked. I mean, all the way down to the silicon chips in your device, which can never be fully disentangled from the odious, paranoid racist William Shockley, who won the Nobel Prize for co-inventing the silicon transistor\n\nCory is right in pointing out that almost any technology we have has been touch by problematic figures. Racists, fascists, sexists, rapists. You name it. Anything you touch will have some research or engineering or product work by a person you despise in it.\n\nThe strawman is his claim that people who criticize LLM usage are doing that for some form of absolutist reasons. That they have a fully binary view of the world as separated into “acceptable, pure things” and “garbage”. Which is of course false. Because they are using a computer, using warm water that’s probably heated through the use of fossil fuels etc.\n\nHe attacks a ridiculous made-up figure to deflect from specific criticism of LLM use (that many probably wouldn’t even apply that strongly to his use case). But that’s not where criticism of LLMs comes from: It’s mostly specific focusing on the material properties of these systems, their production and use.\n\n“Refusing to use a technology because the people who developed it were indefensible creeps is a self-owning dead-end. You know what’s better than refusing to use a technology because you hate its creators? Seizing that technology and making it your own. Don’t like the fact that a convicted monopolist has a death-grip on networking? Steal its protocol, release a free software version of it, and leave it in your dust:”\n\nHere again Cory is misrepresenting the LLM-critic’s argument: Sam Altman is a scam artist and habitual liar, but that’s not one of the first 10 to 20 reasons people criticise OpenAI’s products. Sure, basically every leading figure in the “AI” space seems to be unpleasant at best but that’s true for most of tech TBH. People criticise LLMs for their structural properties, their material impacts, for the way they make it harder to learn and grow, for the way they make products worse while creating massive negative externalities in the form of emissions, water use and e-waste. For the way these systems can only be build by taking every piece of data – regardless of whether the authors consent or even explicitly refuse – and how the training needs ungodly amounts of harmful, exploitative labor done mostly by people in countries from the global majority. How it materially harms the commons.\n\nEven if OpenAI was run by decent, ethical, friendly, trustworthy people (which would then of course make them not work on the products OpenAI has, but it’s just a thought experiment) their products would need to be criticized for what they are and what they do. It’s really not about these few dudes running the companies.\n\nCory misrepresents the arguments (well basically hides them) in order to not have to face any material criticism and turns them into “you just don’t like these people” which frames the criticism as emotional and not rational. As if it was about not liking a bunch of rich men.\n\nHe then goes into how the path forward is to “steal the protocol”. His following paragraph goes into detail:\n\n“That’s how we make good tech: not by insisting that all its inputs be free from sin, but by purging that wickedness by liberating the technology from its monstrous forebears and making free and open versions of it”\n\nAnd here we are coming to the core of the problematic argument. Because Cory implicitly argues that technology is neutral and that one can just change its meaning and effect through usage. But as Langdon Winner argues in his famous essay “Do artifacts have politics” artifacts have built-in politics deriving from their structure. A famous example is the nuclear power plant: Due to the danger of these plants, their needs with regards to resources as well as security, power plants imply a certain form of political arrangement based on having a strong security force/army and a way to force these facilities (and facilities to store the waste in) upon communities potentially against their will.\n\nArtifacts and technologies have certain logics built into their structure that do require certain arrangements around them or that bring forward certain arrangements. The second aspect is often illustrated by how ships are organized: Because ships are sometimes in dangerous situations and sometimes critical decisions need to be made, the existence of ships implies the existence of a hierarchy of power relationships with a captain having the final say. Because democracy would be too slow at times. These politics are built into the artifact.\n\nUnderstanding this you cannot take any technology and “make it good”. Is a torturing device “good” if the plans on how to build it are creative commons? Do we need to answer the existence of the digital torment nexus by building an open source torment nexus? I’d argue we need to destroy it – regardless of what license it is released under.\n\nThat does not mean that it is impossible to take certain technologies or artifacts and try to reframe them, change their meaning. In some way computers are one such example: They were first used by governments, banks and other corporations to reach their goals but where then taken and reframed as devices intended to support personal liberation. It’s a bit more complicated (for why, dive into the late David Golumbia’s “The Cultural Logic of Computation”) but let’s give that one to Cory. Sure, sometimes it is possible to take something originally built for nefarious purposes and find better uses for it. But is that true for everything? Very obviously not.\n\nLet’s just look at the embedded politics of LLMs: In order to train a capable system you need data. Lots of it. AI companies keep buying books to scan them, they download everything from every legal or illegal source claiming “fair use” (a doctrine that only applies to the US by the way) or that “scraping is always okay”. Capable LLMs require a logic of dominance and of disregarding consent of the people producing the artifacts that are the raw material for the system. LLMs are based on extraction, exploitation and subjugation: To produce these systems – even if you release the end result as open weights for people to use at home – you need to take cultural works, personal writing etc. from people who not only not consented but actively reject that notion. The politics of LLMs is violence. How does one “liberate” that? What’s the case for open source violence?\n\nHe uses a so-called “open source LLM” and that’s very much how he presents his values but open-source LLMs do not really exist. You can download some weights but cannot understand what went into them or really change or reproduce them. Open source AI is just marketing and openwashing.\n\nCory shows his libertarian leanings here: If everything is somehow “free and open” then we have won. But “free and open” in this context usually means that “certain privileged groups have easy access to it and are not limited in what to do with it”. That’s one of the core problems with the whole “open Source” movement: That it reduces all struggle to if one can get their hands on the tools and has any restrictions to using them.\n\nThis also shines through in Cory arguing that we need to “liberate” technology. What a strange idea: Technology doesn’t need liberation, people do. Technologies are tools, not what we actually care about. Sure, sometimes technologies can play a role in liberating people but just as often “freeing” a technology does quite the opposite to people: Ask the women who have massive amounts of nonconsensually created sexualized images and videos generated of them whether they think that the “liberation” of stochastic images generators is liberating them? Technology doesn’t need to be free. It cannot be free because freedom as a concept applies to people.\n\nAnd freedom is not the only value that we care about. Making everything “free” sounds cool but who pays for that freedom? Who pays for us having for example access to the freedom an open weight LLM brings? Our freedom as users rests on the exploitation of and violence against the people suffering the data centers, labeling the data for the training, the folks gathering the resources for NVIDIA to build chips. Freedom is not a zero-sum game but a lot of the freedoms that wealthy people in the right (which I am one of) enjoy stem from other people’s lack thereof.\n\n“Purity culture is such an obvious trap, an artifact of the neoliberal ideology that insists that the solution to all our problems is to shop very carefully, thus reducing all politics to personal consumption choices:”\n\nCory labels people’s values and their prioritization as “purity culture” (referring back to the black and white strawman the started this part of his post with) and then pulls a really interesting spin here: Many people criticizing LLMs come from a somewhat leftist (in contrast to Cory’s libertarian) background. Cory intentionally frames those leftist thoughts that put politics based on values as “neoliberal ideology” that reduces “all politics to personal consumption choices”. This is clever narratively: Tell those stupid leftists that they are just neoliberals, the thing they hate! Awesome.\n\nBut the argument against using LLMs is not about shopping and markets at all. My not using LLMs does not influence anything in that regard, Microsoft will just keep making the data center go BRRRRRRR.\n\nIn a way this framing shows more about Cory’s thinking than about that of the people he criticises: Cory is focused on markets and market dynamics and in that world it’s about purchasing. But moral choices only sometimes relate to markets. They do when I for example choose only to buy fairly produced garments. But when I for example refused conscription (when I was young Germany still forced every young man to learn how to kill) that was not a shopping decision. That was politics as well as leading an ethical life.\n\nPeople do not believe that “not using LLMs” will solve the issue of OpenAI etc all existing. They do no want to build on, use products with so clearly defined harms and negative externalities. Because they believe it to be wrong. Sure, there might be a utilitarian argument for “the thing exists anyways and if it saves you time, that’s good, right” but many people are not utilitarians. They want to lead a life where they feel their actions align with their values. In a way that is a path to freedom: To having the freedom to make the decisions one feels are right are in alignment with one’s values.\n\nWhich Cory actually also believe and acts upon when it’s about his values: He has refused to create a Bluesky account in spite of wanting to be there cause his friends are there for (good!) ideological reasons: Because Bluesky was back then and honestly is still today mostly centralized with the Bluesky corporation having a central chokepoint to control the network. Cory believes that one sometimes needs to make decisions based on one’s values. He just does not think that your values as someone not wanting to use LLMs matter.\n\nI mean, it was extraordinarily stupid for the Nazis to refuse Einstein’s work because it was “Jewish science,” but not merely because antisemitism is stupid.\n\nEverybody hates Nazis. Implying that one is in any way like the Nazis is just a killer argument. But let’s talk about Nazis for a second. The Nazis did a lot of psychological and medical research. On people they interned and later killed in concentration camps. There actually was a massive debate within especially psychology whether using the results of that kind of research is ethically possible. Utilitarianism of course argues that if it’s there one should use it but especially when your whole discipline is focused on understanding how our psyche works in order to for example help people in trauma just taking research that has been created through unthinkable violence and torture feels wrong. Feels contrarian to what your whole discipline is there for. This reminds me of Ursula K. Le Guin’s story “The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas“: Omelas is an almost perfect city. Rich, democratic, pleasant. But it only works by having one small child in perpetual torment. Okay, but if that kid is already suffering because those other people chose to, should you walk away? Of just reap the fruits of that suffering?\n\nSometimes you need to walk away.\n\nCory then repeats the strawmen we already talked about and lands here:\n\n“It’s not “unethical” to scrape the web in order to create and analyze data-sets. That’s just “a search engine””\n\nAgain, he twists the argument in the way that the AI corporations like to do it as well: Search engines scour the web so AI companies should be allowed the same. It’s the same technology! But what’s the purpose?\n\nA search engine scrapes pages to build an “index” in order to let people find those pages. The scraping has value for the page and its owner as well because it leads to more people finding it and therefore connecting to the writer, journalist, musician, artist, etc. Search engines create connection.\n\nAI scrapers do not guide people towards the original maker’s work. They extract it and reproduce it (often wrongly). “AI”‘s don’t point out to the web for you to find other’s work to relate to, they keep you in their loop and give you the answer cutting off any connection to the original sources.\n\nWhile the technology of scraping is the same, the purpose and material effects of those two systems is massively different. Again, Cory misrepresents the critique and tries to make it look unreasonable by making it just a conversation about tech without regarding how that technology affects the world and the people in it.\n\nI appreciate a lot of work Cory Doctorow has done in the last decades. But the arguments he presents here to defend his usage of LLMs for this rather trivial task (which TBH could probably be done reasonably well with traditional means) are part of why the Internet – and therefore the world – looks like it does right now. It’s a set of arguments that wants to delegitimize political and moral actions based on libertarian and utilitarian thinking.\n\nTechnologies are embedded not only in their deployment but also in their creation, conceptualization. They carry the understanding of the world that their makers believe in and reproduce those. A bit like an LLM reproduces the texts it learned from: It might not always be a 100% identical replica but it’s structurally so similar that the differences are surface level.\n\nIn order to build an Internet and a world that is more inclusive, fairer, freer we need to move past the dogma of unchecked innovation and technology. We need to re-politicize our conversations about technology and their effects and goals in order to build the structures (technological, political, social) we want. The structures that lead to a conviviality in harmony with the planet we all live on and will live on till the end of our days.\n\nThat path is paved with discussions about political and moral values. Discussions about how certain technological artifacts do align with those values or not.\n\nI do agree with Cory that demanding perfect purity lead nowhere. We are imperfect people in an imperfect world. I just do not think that this means to go all accellerationalist. Just turning the “open source” dial up to 11 does not stop the apocalypse. It’s a lot harder.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.",

    "description": ": Watchdogs warn models that can generate realistic images of people must comply with data protection laws",
    "fullText": "A global coalition of privacy watchdogs has fired a warning shot at the generative AI industry, saying companies churning out realistic synthetic images can't pretend that data protection rules don't apply.\n\nThe joint statement [PDF] signed by more than 60 regulators, including the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), boils down to a simple point: if your model can convincingly fake a person, you don't get to pretend data protection law doesn't exist.\n\n\"Recent developments – particularly AI image and video generation integrated into widely accessible social media platforms – have enabled the creation of non-consensual intimate imagery, defamatory depictions, and other harmful content featuring real individuals,\" said the signatories. \"We are especially concerned about potential harms to children and other vulnerable groups, such as cyberbullying and/or exploitation.\"\n\nThe warning lands weeks after the ICO and DPC opened formal probes into Elon Musk's xAI following reports that its Grok chatbot produced sexual images of real people without their consent.\n\nThe group says organizations dabbling in generative AI need to build safeguards from the start and think carefully about risks such as non-consensual imagery, misuse of someone's likeness, and potential harms to children – all areas where the tech has raced ahead of social norms and, in some cases, common sense.\n\nThe regulators stress that the law already covers this, and that firms don't get a free pass just because the content came from a machine.\n\nWilliam Malcolm, executive director of Regulatory Risk & Innovation at the ICO, said: \"People should be able to benefit from AI without fearing that their identity, dignity or safety are under threat. AI already plays a large role in all our lives, and everybody has a right to expect that AI systems handling their personal data will do so with respect. Responsible innovation means putting people first: anticipating the risks and building in meaningful safeguards to ensure autonomy, transparency, and control.\n\n\"Public trust is foundational to the successful adoption and use of AI. Joint regulatory initiatives like this show global commitment to high standards of data protection in AI systems and help provide regulatory certainty. We expect those developing and deploying AI to act responsibly. Where we find that obligations have not been met, we will take action to protect the public.\"\n\nThe joint statement on AI-generated imagery suggests that if companies want to keep pushing ever more realistic AI into everyday products, they should expect regulators to keep asking awkward questions about how it all works. ®",

    "fullText": "A fiscal note on the proposed Chicago Bears stadium construction package shows northwest Indiana residents could pay millions in new taxes, which could grow with use by visitors to the region.\n\nThe statement — prepared by the nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency — still includes many unknowns but does provide some baseline revenue estimates for hospitality-related taxes.\n\nUnder Senate Bill 27, a state-crafted authority would take out bonds to build the stadium. A bevy of taxes would provide revenue to make the annual bond payments.\n\nThe exact cost of the project is unknown at this time though the Chicago Bears have committed $2 billion and House Speaker Todd Huston said Thursday in unveiling the plan that as much as $1 billion in public funding could be involved.\n\nThe bill allows Lake and Porter counties to each adopt a 1% food-and-beverage tax by June 30, 2027. Revenue from these taxes would go to the Northwest Indiana Stadium Board.\n\nIf both counties impose the 1% food-and-beverage tax, they could collect an estimated total of at least $12 million to $18 million annually, according to the fiscal estimate datedFriday. The estimate is based on the existing food services industry in each county and revenue collected in counties that currently impose such taxes.\n\nChicago Bears call Indiana deal ‘step forward’ for building new stadium in Hammond\n\n“The actual amount of revenue in Lake and Porter counties would likely be greater to the extent the stadium project results in increased demand for food and beverages,” it said.\n\nThe bill allows Lake County to increase the local hotel tax rate from its current 5% to 10%. The county council is required to adopt an ordinance increasing the tax rate by June 30, 2027.\n\nRevenue received from the hotel tax increase could be at least $5.4 million annually. But the statement says “the actual innkeeper’s tax revenue distributed to the board would likely be greater once the stadium and other facilities have been built.”\n\nHammond could also establish a 12% admissions tax on tickets for events held in the stadium. The tax is imposed on tickets offered for sale to the public at a box office or authorized agent, and does not apply to season tickets or a personal seat license.\n\nAll revenue collected would go to the Northwest Indiana Stadium Board to pay debt owed by the board.\n\nThe fiscal estimates the tax would generate around $12 million annually once the facility begins holding events. However, the revenue could be greater depending on the events that are held at the stadium.\n\nThe 10% Marion County admissions tax, which applies to events held at Lucas Oil Stadium, Victory Field, Gainbridge Fieldhouse and the Indiana Convention Center, generated $31.3 million during fiscal year 2025.\n\nAnother provision in the bill would create the Northwest Indiana Professional Sports Development Area. It could include any facility or complex of facilities that is used to hold a professional sporting event, including a stadium, parking garages, training facilities, and other related areas as specified in the bill.\n\nIt provides for allocation of covered taxes, including taxes paid for wages earned by athletes playing home games in a sporting facility, to the tax area. It defines covered taxes as state sales and use tax; individual income tax; local income tax; food and beverage taxes. Those revenues can be used for costs related to financing, construction, operating, maintaining and administration of the facilities established as part of the area.\n\nThe fiscal analysis said the total capture for the new tax area is unknown, but it will be less than the Marion County Professional Sports Development Area. That area — containing three sports facilities, a convention center and training facility — brings in over $16 million a year.\n\nOne final section of the bill allows dollars captured through a renegotiation of the Indiana Toll Road lease in 2026 to be used by the Indiana Finance Authority to pay or reimburse any costs associated with transportation and infrastructure projects in the following counties associated with the stadium relocation: Elkhart, LaGrange, Lake, LaPorte, Porter, Steuben and St. Joseph.\n\nAn information request with the IFA is currently pending concerning how much in revenue could be received from a renegotiation of the lease of the Indiana Toll Road, the fiscal report said.\n\nSenate Bill 27 is set for a second reading in the Indiana House on Monday and will be finalized by Friday, when this year’s legislative session is set to conclude.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",

    "description": "Like the Mi-24 Hind before it, albeit to a far more austere degree, the Mi-28’s fuselage compartment can be used in a pinch for rescues.",
    "fullText": "As well as being a key component of Russia’s attack helicopter force in the war in Ukraine, the Mi-28 Havoc has been in the news recently on account of its apparent delivery to Iran. Meanwhile, one lesser-known aspect of the Mi-28 is its ability to transport two or three passengers in a cramped fuselage compartment, a feature that is seen clearly in a recently published video of the rotorcraft.\n\nMi-28NM attack helicopter • Preflight Checks & Takeoff.\n[b/n \"05\" yellow?]\n\nVGTRK(Feb. 2026) https://t.co/F5sBjCQ3rBpic.twitter.com/0QRbVgQFSN\n\n— Massimo Frantarelli (@MrFrantarelli) February 23, 2026\n\nThe footage in question originates with the state-owned Russia Television and Radio channel and shows a Russian Aerospace Forces Mi-28NM — the latest domestic version of the gunship — undergoing pre-flight checks at a forward airstrip somewhere in the Ukrainian conflict zone. The video reportedly dates from this month.\n\nAt the start of the video, a technician is seen handling hoses that run into the helicopter’s port-side rear fuselage via an open door. Typically, such hoses are attached to dehumidifier units, which then blow warm, dry air through the aircraft to keep everything dry. This is especially important for sensitive avionics in cold weather, as on this snowy airfield. Once the helicopter is fully powered up, it should keep itself warm enough for moisture not to be a problem.\n\nWhat’s most interesting, however, is that the open door provides a rare look into this rear-fuselage compartment, which has the capacity to carry two or three people, or an equivalent load of cargo. Of course, this is in addition to the Mi-28’s two crew seated in tandem in the cockpit — the weapon system operator/navigator forward and the pilot to the rear.\n\nA look at the door armor on a Mi-28 attack helicopter.https://t.co/PTEzmFYUeY pic.twitter.com/wy6am7wkh2\n\n— Rob Lee (@RALee85) May 27, 2019\n\nThe fuselage compartment, unique among in-service attack helicopters, was part of the Mi-28’s design when it was first schemed back in the second half of the 1970s. The Soviet Union had ordered Mil to design a new-generation combat helicopter, equivalent to the U.S. AH-64 Apache, but this feature was all its own.\n\nThe Mi-28’s configuration was broadly similar to the AH-64, but marked a significant move away from the philosophy enshrined in the previous Mi-24 Hind. As we have discussed in the past, the Mi-24 had been built around a passenger/cargo cabin — with space for a squad of infantry — although, as it was developed, it expanded its anti-armor capabilities, too.\n\nA walkaround video of a privately owned Mi-24 in the United States. The passenger/cargo cabin is seen in detail from around the 11:30 mark:\n\nIn contrast, the Mi-28 was a tank-killer first and foremost, with no cabin, and better overall performance. However, there was internal space for a much smaller compartment and one that would be very useful for retrieving downed pilots from the battle area, especially for grabbing a pilot who went down within the same flight. Bearing in mind the expected aircraft losses on Europe’s Central Front — especially among low-flying helicopters — this made a lot of sense.\n\nOther tasks could have included moving mechanics and tools to conduct limited repairs of other helicopters in an emergency. Potentially, it could even have been used for inserting and picking up infiltrators or saboteurs.\n\nHaving the option of using the Mi-28 as a kind of ad-hoc, or non-traditional combat search and rescue (CSAR) asset would also mean that the aircraft could operate on its own and on the fly if other air or ground assets were not available. Traditionally, CSAR helicopters have to operate with an armed escort. It’s unknown whether the passenger cabin has been used at all in the war in Ukraine, but the limited space, presence of avionics equipment, and complete lack of windows mean it’s only really suited to emergencies. For more typical CSAR missions in the Ukrainian theater, Mi-8 Hips and Mi-24s are typically used, with an escort of Mi-28 or Ka-52 Hokum attack helicopters.\n\nAs for other attack helicopter types attempting personnel recovery, the best-known incident is likely that involving two British Army Apache gunships in Afghanistan in January 2007. During that dramatic mission, four Royal Marines strapped themselves to the outside of two Apaches for an attempted combat rescue. Ultimately, they were only able to recover the body of their fallen comrade, Lance Corporal Ford, who had already been killed.\n\nThe Italian Army, too, has explored the concept of using its A129 Mangusta attack helicopters for personnel rescue, strapping a pair of soldiers to the main landing gear struts. Meanwhile, the U.S. Army Special Operations Command operates MH-6M Little Birds with side-mounted planks to externally airlift special operators. A more elaborate modular system, used to transport small numbers of personnel, was schemed for the Bell 360 Invictus armed scout helicopter, as you can read about here.\n\nIt’s also worth pointing out another planned ‘survival’ feature of the Mi-28, namely its crew-escape system. Unlike the Ka-52, the Mi-28 doesn’t have ejection seats. Instead, the Zvezda/Tomilino Pamir-K crew seats have belts that tighten automatically when high-g loads are encountered. As originally envisaged, the crew escape system would work as follows. During any kind of catastrophic failure at altitude, the cockpit doors would be blown off, the stub wings would be jettisoned together with their loads, and an inflatable door-sill sleeve would be filled with air. This was to protect the crew from the protruding main landing gear and cannon and help them clear the helicopter, after which they would return to the ground by parachute. In theory, at least.\n\nKa-52 alligator and its unique K-37-800M ejection seats.

(@VladZinen) December 11, 2020\n\nIn practice, it seems the crew escape system never reached operational status on the Mi-28, likely due to the very limited window in which it would be of practical use.\n\nAccording to the Oryx open-source tracking group, Russia has lost 19 Mi-28s since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine four years ago. This figure could be higher because Oryx only tabulates losses it can confirm visually. Russia began the conflict with a force of around 110 Mi-28s of all versions.\n\nVideo of the destruction of the Mi-28 of the\n\nFPV drone.

The original Havoc was abandoned by the early 1990s, and Mil pressed ahead with the radar-equipped, night-capable Mi-28N version. Deliveries of production Mi-28N helicopters to Russia began in 2008, and export versions have since been sold to Algeria, Iraq, Uganda, and, apparently, now also Iran.\n\nNewly delivered Russian Mi-28NE attack helicopter was spotted over Tehran, Iran. pic.twitter.com/Mq5x9q4NHh\n\n— Clash Report (@clashreport) February 3, 2026\n\nFor Russia, the basic version remains the Mi-28N, which also undertook combat operations in Syria starting in 2016.\n\nLess common is the Mi-28UB (only 24 of which were produced), which received a mast-mounted radar, lacking on the Mi-28N, and dual controls. As for the latest Mi-28NM version — as seen in the video above — this also has the mast-mounted radar and other changes, including new missiles. As well as having been ordered in quantity for Russia, there are also plans to bring older Mi-28N aircraft up to Mi-28NM standard.\n\nVideo of the radar-equipped Mi-28UB during a live-fire exercise in the Krasnodar region, March 2020:\n\nFor all the changes that the Mi-28 has undergone since it first appeared, its highly compact passenger compartment remains one of its most unusual features.\n\nContact the author: thomas@thewarzone.com",

    "fullText": "PARIS (AP) — France's top diplomat Monday requested that U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner no longer be allowed direct access to members of the French government after he skipped a meeting to discuss comments by the Trump administration over the beating death of a far-right activist.\n\nFrench authorities had summoned Kushner to the Quai d'Orsay, which houses the Foreign Affairs Ministry, on Monday evening but he did not show up, according to diplomatic sources.\n\nJean-Noel Barrot, the foreign affairs minister, moved to restrict Kushner's access “in light of this apparent misunderstanding of the basic expectations of the mission of an ambassador, who has the honor of representing his country.”\n\nThe ministry, however, left the door open for reconciliation.\n\n“It remains, of course, possible for Ambassador Charles Kushner to carry out his duties and present himself at the Quai d’Orsay, so that we may hold the diplomatic discussions needed to smooth over the irritants that can inevitably arise in a friendship spanning 250 years,” it said.\n\nKushner had been summoned following a statement by the State Department’s Counterterrorism Bureau, which posted on X that “reports, corroborated by the French Minister of the Interior, that Quentin Deranque was killed by left-wing militants, should concern us all.” The U.S. Embassy had posted that statement on social media.\n\nDeranque, a far-right activist, died of brain injuries this month from a beating in the French city of Lyon. He was attacked during a fight on the margins of a student meeting where a far-left lawmaker was a keynote speaker.\n\nHis killing highlighted a climate of deep political tension ahead of next year’s presidential vote.\n\n“We reject any instrumentalization of this tragedy, which has plunged a French family into mourning, for political ends,” Barrot said over the weekend. “We have no lessons to learn, particularly on the issue of violence, from the international reactionary movement.”\n\nThe State Department said in its post that “violent radical leftism is on the rise and its role in Quentin Deranque’s death demonstrates the threat it poses to public safety. We will continue to monitor the situation and expect to see the perpetrators of violence brought to justice.”\n\nKushner was summoned in August over his letter to French President Emmanuel Macron alleging the country did not do enough to combat antisemitism. France’s foreign officials met with a representative of the U.S. ambassador since the diplomat did not show up.",

    "fullText": "Russia’s invasion of Ukraine four years ago launched Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II, causing immense suffering for civilians and harrowing ordeals for soldiers while rewriting the post-Cold War security order.\n\nThe fighting enters its fifth year on Tuesday, and it shows no signs of stopping anytime soon.\n\nThe U.S. has brokered talks with delegations from Moscow and Kyiv as part of the Trump administration's yearlong push for peace. But reconciling key differences, such as the future of Russian-occupied Ukrainian land and postwar security for Ukraine, has thwarted progress.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of each countries’ troops have died on the battlefield, and Ukrainian civilians have been battered by Russian aerial strikes that have brought years of power outages and water cuts.\n\nHere’s a look at the conflict, by the numbers, since the full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nThe upper end of the estimated number of soldiers killed, wounded or missing on both sides, according to a report last month by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank.\n\nIt estimated that Russia suffered 1.2 million casualties, including up to 325,000 troop deaths, between February 2022 and December 2025 — what it said was the largest number of troop deaths for any major power in any conflict since World War II.\n\nRussia has not released figures on battlefield deaths since January 2023, when it said more than 80 soldiers were killed in a Ukrainian strike, bringing the total military deaths Moscow has confirmed to just over 6,000.\n\nCSIS estimated that Ukraine has seen 500,000 to 600,000 military casualties, including up to 140,000 deaths.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this month that 55,000 Ukrainian troops have died in the war. Many are missing, he said.\n\nNeither Moscow nor Kyiv gives timely data on military losses. Independent verification is not possible.\n\nThe U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission’s count for civilian deaths in Ukraine since Russia’s all-out invasion, though it says that is likely an underestimate. More than 40,600 civilians were injured over the same period, it said in a December report.\n\nThe war has killed at least 763 children, according to the U.N.\n\nLast year was the deadliest for civilians in Ukraine since 2022. The conflict killed 2,514 civilians and injured 12,142 in the country in 2025 — a 31% increase in civilian casualties over 2024, it said.\n\nThe percentage of Ukrainian land occupied by Russia, according to the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nOver the past year, Russia has gained just 0.79% of Ukraine’s territory in the grinding war of attrition, the Washington-based think tank said in calculations provided earlier this month to The Associated Press, underscoring the little progress Moscow's forces have made despite huge costs in troops and armor.\n\nBefore Russia’s all-out invasion, it controlled nearly 7% of Ukraine, including Crimea and parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the east, as Moscow-backed separatists fought the Ukrainian army, according to Ukrainian officials and Western analysts.\n\nThe percentage drop in foreign military aid to Kyiv last year compared with the annual average between 2022 and 2024, according to Germany’s Kiel Institute, which tracks assistance to Kyiv.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump stopped sending American weapons paid for by the U.S. to Ukraine after he took office just over a year ago. European countries, striving to make up the difference, increased their military aid last year by 67% compared with the 2022-2024 period, the institute said in a report this month.\n\nForeign humanitarian and financial aid to Ukraine fell by 5% last year in comparison with the average in the previous three years, it said.\n\nThe number of Ukrainian civilians who have left their country.\n\nSome 5.3 million of those people have found refuge in Europe, according to a report this month from the U.N. office in Ukraine.\n\nAdditionally, around 3.7 million Ukrainians forced out of their homes have moved elsewhere within the country, the U.N. said in December.\n\nUkraine's prewar population was more than 40 million.\n\nThe number of Russian attacks that affected the provision of medical care in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion, according to a report from the World Health Organization on Monday.\n\nThere was a nearly 20% increase in such attacks last year compared with 2024, the U.N. agency said.\n\nA report earlier in the month from the WHO documented at least 2,347 strikes on health care facilities, in addition to others that damaged vehicles and the storage of medical supplies.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "Bitcoin price faces $60 billion whale selling pressure as consolidation persists, raising risks of breakdown toward $60,000 support levels.",
    "fullText": "Bitcoin price is consolidating after recent volatility, trading within a neutral structure. The crypto king has struggled to establish a decisive trend over the past two weeks.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin remains rangebound, reflecting balanced pressure between buyers and sellers. This equilibrium suggests that investor behavior from here will likely determine the next directional move.\n\nOn-chain data indicates that younger holders are choosing to HODL rather than exit positions. HODL waves show that the supply held by investors aged one to three months has declined by 5%. This supply has matured into the three- to six-month cohort, signaling reduced short-term selling.\n\nThis shift reflects improving holder resilience despite recent drawdowns. Bitcoin investors who remain underwater are not engaging in panic-driven liquidation. Instead, coins are aging into longer-term categories, which historically supports price stability. Reduced short-term distribution often limits downside volatility and strengthens structural support zones.\n\nWant more token insights like this? \n\nWhile some holders’ behavior appears stable, whale activity presents a contrasting dynamic. Since February 13, large holders have moved approximately 900,000 BTC, valued at $60 billion. This transfer activity suggests that significant capital may be preparing to exit positions following limited price appreciation.\n\nPersistent whale selling can introduce supply shocks, particularly in range-bound conditions. Large distributions increase overhead resistance and weaken bullish momentum. If critical holders grow increasingly impatient, sustained selling pressure could undermine BTC’s stability and elevate the probability of a broader correction.\n\nBitcoin is trading at $66,188 at the time of writing after slipping below the $67,394 support level. The asset remains confined between $65,000 and $70,000. This consolidation range reflects ongoing equilibrium. A decisive breakout or breakdown will likely define the next major move in Bitcoin price.\n\nOver the past two weeks, BTC has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern. Price action shows no clear directional bias. However, continued whale selling could tip the balance downward. A breakdown below the triangle support may send Bitcoin toward $64,142. Losing that level would expose BTC to a potential decline toward $60,000. Notably, a recent long lower wick signaled dip buying interest.",

    "fullText": "Feb 23 (Reuters) - Paramount Skydance submitted a higher offer for Warner Bros Discovery, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday, ratcheting up efforts to derail the HBO Max owner's deal with Netflix.\n\nThe bidding war for one of Hollywood's most coveted assets including the \"Harry Potter\" and \"Game of Thrones\" franchises has raised ‌the stakes for dominance in the streaming-led market.\n\nHow does Netflix's bid compare to Paramount's proposal?\n\nWhy is Warner Bros Discovery a coveted acquisition target?\n\nWhat regulatory challenges could block these merger deals?\n\nWhat are the key details of Paramount's revised offer?\n\nParamount's new bid — which improves its initial offer of $108.4 billion, or $30 per share, for the whole company — seeks to address Warner Bros ‌concerns about the certainty of its financing, the source said.\n\nWarner Bros' chosen suitor Netflix, which offered to buy ​the studios and streaming assets for $27.75 per share in cash, or $82.7 billion, is allowed to match the latest bid from David Ellison-led Paramount.\n\nNetflix has ample cash and could bump up its offer for HBO Max owner, while Paramount's rival bid is backed by Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison.\n\nThe CBS parent was asked to submit its \"best and final offer\" after Warner Bros rejected an enhanced bid that included paying the $2.8 billion in termination fee to Netflix and adding a 25-cent per share quarterly \"ticking fee\" from next year to compensate Warner Bros shareholders for any delay in deal closure.\n\nWarner Bros had said Paramount's February 10 offer still falls short ‌of what its board would consider a superior proposal and gave ⁠a seven-day deadline until February 23 to submit a revised offer.\n\nMoffettNathanson analysts had earlier said that an offer in the range of $34 per share from Paramount would end the bidding war and \"avoid further debate over Discovery Global's value.\"\n\nWarner Bros plans to spin off Discovery Global, which holds cable TV assets such as ⁠CNN and HGTV, could fetch between $1.33 and $6.86 a share, according to Warner Bros estimates.\n\nNetflix said its offer gives Warner Bros shareholders added upside from the Discovery Global spinoff, which WBD argues will add value by giving the new company greater strategic, operational and financial flexibility.\n\nHowever, Paramount has said the cable spinoff central to the streaming giant's offer is effectively worthless.\n\nThe David Zaslav-led Warner Bros came under pressure from Ancora Capital after the activist investor ​built ​a roughly $200 million stake in the HBO owner and accused the company of failing to adequately engage with ​Paramount.",

    "description": "A harrowing fall while skiing in the backcountry of Japan complicated Kate Johnson's pregnancy in aggravating ways.",
    "fullText": "It was supposed to be peak relaxation.\n\nKate Johnson and her husband, Sean, planned a 10-day ski vacation to Japan early last year. They figured it would be their last big trip for a while since they were trying to get pregnant.\n\nA few weeks before boarding the plane, the Hoboken couple found out they were expecting.\n\n“I weighed my options on being able to ski and figured that so early on in the pregnancy, it wouldn’t have that much of an effect,” Johnson, 38, told The Post. “Little did I know how that was going to turn out.”\n\nSpoiler alert: It went downhill fast. A harrowing fall while skiing in the backcountry of Japan complicated Johnson’s pregnancy in aggravating ways — and underscored how difficult it can be for pregnant women’s health concerns to be taken seriously.\n\nJohnson’s tumble came on her second day of skiing in the area of Nagano, the site of the 1998 Winter Olympics. She and Sean were being led by a guide up and down a mountain and throughout a nearby valley.\n\n“The second run down, I just caught like an edge. I got a little bit too much speed, and I sort of fell backwards,” the digital retail sales specialist recalled.\n\n“And when that happened, I sort of heard this pop,” she continued. “I don’t fall that often, so I didn’t really know exactly what was happening.”\n\nJohnson — who began skiing at 4 years old — tried to get her bearings. She was startled to hear a “massive cracking sound” in her right knee when she pulled her boot back on.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, she had fallen in an avalanche zone, so a helicopter came to dramatically rescue her.\n\nJohnson landed in a nearby hospital, where doctors suspected a patellar tendon injury but didn’t perform an MRI. Many doctors avoid MRIs in the first trimester as a precaution, even though there are no proven harmful effects on the fetus.\n\nJohnson was given “an enormous brace” and crutches to navigate the rest of her dream vacation.\n\nOnce she got back to the States, the real nightmare began.\n\nAt home in New Jersey, she struggled to find a doctor who would fix the problem.\n\nShe had to jump through hoops just to get an MRI, which revealed a full rupture of her ACL and a tear in her meniscus, the cartilage pad in the knee that absorbs shock and provides stability.\n\nMost of the 15 to 20 doctors she contacted suggested she wait until after she delivered to undergo surgery — but Johnson was ready to move forward.\n\n“[I] have a history of depression, anxiety and disordered eating, so movement is super important to me [for] regulating myself,” she explained.\n\nShe finally came upon Dr. Abigail Campbell, co-director of the NYU Langone Center for Women’s Sports Medicine.\n\nWhile some surgeons may postpone non-emergency procedures on pregnant women due to the potential risks of anesthesia, Campbell was game to do the procedure.\n\n“Like many things in pregnancy, [anesthesia] is one of those things that there has been minimal data on, so when unsure, it is assumed that it may not be safe in pregnancy,” Campbell told The Post.\n\n“However, there have been several studies in the past few years come out in the orthopedic trauma literature regarding safe practices and safe outcomes for surgery (for orthopedic injuries) in pregnant individuals.”\n\nJohnson’s medical team decided to perform the surgery when she was about 16 weeks along.\n\n“The second trimester is preferred for elective procedures in pregnant patients because of the confounding risk of spontaneous abortion (which is elevated in the first trimester) and the risk of preterm labor (which is higher in the third trimester),” Campbell noted.\n\nThe operation required a single X-ray, which confirmed that Johnson had actually torn the other meniscus in her right knee as well because her knee was so unstable.\n\nTo capture that image, Campbell and Johnson each had to wear two layers of lead aprons to protect their fetuses from radiation.\n\nCampbell, herself, was pregnant with a girl at the time.\n\n“Normally, surgeons wear one layer of lead aprons during surgery,” Campbell said. “On my end, wearing two layers of lead just made me hot during the procedure, but I had to do this all the time! Got used to it.”\n\nJohnson was given spinal anesthesia for the ACL reconstruction and meniscus repairs. The entire ordeal took over 90 minutes, during which Johnson’s baby was monitored to make sure he was OK.\n\nPost-procedure, Johnson had scar tissue and a couple of nights of restless leg syndrome to contend with, but her recovery went “surprisingly” well. That’s good news since she eschewed painkillers throughout the pregnancy.\n\nJohnson gave birth to son Brody on Oct. 3 — he clocked in at a healthy 6 pounds, 8 ounces.\n\n“Now it’s just a matter of building up the muscles that have sort of atrophied through non-use on both knees at this point,” Johnson said.\n\nFor her part, Campbell gave birth in July to daughter Louise.\n\nShe’s proud of Johnson’s recovery and her persistence in getting a variety of medical opinions.\n\n“Truly elective surgery, like cosmetic surgery, are not recommended, but in situations like this, in which waiting could result in long-term irreversible joint damage, the benefits outweigh the risks,” Campbell said about surgery while pregnant.\n\nAnd the whole misadventure hasn’t given Johnson cold feet for skiing.\n\n“I’m really lucky that this year the snow is so terrible that I’m not having horrible FOMO, but I’m already thinking about next year — when we can get back out and when we can get Brody on skis,” she confessed.",

    "fullText": "TORONTO (AP) — Canada announced Monday that it is working on an aid package for Cuba as it faces blackouts and severe fuel shortages worsened by a U.S oil embargo.\n\nForeign Minister Anita Anand declined to give details beyond that.\n\n“We are preparing a plan to assist. We are not prepared at this point to provide any details of the announcement,” Anand said.\n\nCuba is facing an increasingly dire energy crisis that has heightened in recent weeks after oil shipments from Venezuela, its main oil supplier, were halted when the U.S. attacked the South American country in early January and arrested its leader. Mexico, another major supplier, then also suspended oil shipments under U.S. pressure.\n\nAir Canada and other airlines have canceled flights to the Caribbean island because of a shortage of aviation fuel on the island.\n\nCanadian tourism is vital to Cuba’s economy. Global Affairs Canada, a governmental office, has said Canada is Cuba’s second-largest source of direct investment to the island, particularly in the mining and tourism sectors.\n\nCanada would join Mexico in providing aid.\n\nTwo Mexican Navy ships laden with humanitarian aid docked in Cuba earlier this month, two weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on countries that sell oil to the island, deepening an already severe economic and energy crisis in the Caribbean nation. The ships brought about 800 tons of goods, and another 1,500 tons of powdered milk and beans.\n\nThe economic crisis gripping Cuba since 2020 has been compounded by intensified U.S. sanctions aimed at forcing a change in the island’s political model. These pressures led to critical shortages and severe blackouts that peaked in early 2026.\n\nBecause Cuba produces only 40% of its required fuel, it remains highly vulnerable to external blockades. While strong allies like Russia and China have condemned the U.S. measures, their support has remained largely symbolic thus far.\n\nFollow AP’s Latin America coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

    "description": "With the Colorado River shrinking and its water rights in flux, the Central Arizona Project has assembled a coalition to campaign for its share.",
    "fullText": "A Central Arizona Project-backed advocacy group called the Coalition for Protecting Arizona’s Lifeline has begun rolling out television ads and online videos defending the water supplier’s rights to a Colorado River that is under serious hydrological and political strain.\n\n“Arizona is being unfairly targeted for reductions of Colorado River water that would cripple our state, flatten our economy and weaken our nation’s defense,” an ad aired by the coalition warns. It goes on to note that Arizona communities have done their part, committing more water for conservation in Lake Mead than those in other states, and that several options that the federal government is weighing for managing the river would fall hardest on the state.\n\nOne such alternative under review, CAP General Manager Brenda Burman recently said, would essentially dry up the agency’s canal from the river to Phoenix and Tucson.\n\n“In that alternative, they proposed to take us off the map,” she said. Three other alternatives do less harm to CAP. The agency has rejected all as unfairly penalizing Arizona while demanding much less from upstream states in particular.\n\nThe alternatives Burman was referring to were never stated as the Trump administration’s preference, but rather as ideas from which the seven states that share the river water might draw from in writing an agreement for sharing in its worsening shortages. Now that the states have failed to reach such an agreement, though, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is faced with either enacting something like them or rapidly developing a new federal plan in time to replace river guidelines that expire this autumn.\n\nNatural re\n\nIn normal times before the last quarter-century of drought, CAP was entitled to 1.6 million acre-feet of water — each acre-foot equating to roughly 326,000 gallons and enough to support about three households for a year. In those plentiful times Arizona took some of that water and sunk it in the ground for future use.\n\nIn recent years, Lake Mead's loss of stored water has forced CAP to forego more than 500,000 acre-feet a year. Worse cutbacks are on the horizon, but just how dry the canal will go depends on what rules the federal government imposes.\n\nAnticipating a fight, CAP formed the coalition last summer, announcing that discussions with the mayors of Phoenix, Tucson, Mesa and Surprise had led to its creation. Two dozen other mayors ultimately joined, along with leaders of several commerce groups and Native American tribes.\n\nThe coalition’s website and ads ask Arizonans to pledge their support for the effort to protect CAP water. The group has posted numerous video testimonials from members.\n\n“If there are major cuts or changes in how Colorado River water is allocated, the impacts on our communities and the entire state could be devastating,” Casa Grande Mayor Lisa Fitzgibbons said in one such testimonial. “That’s why Arizona and cities like Casa Grande are taking proactive steps to protect our water future,” including by a city demand management program.\n\nWhile the materials don’t directly state members’ intended method of securing water, some of the videos lean heavily on the so-called Law of the River and its guarantee of water from the four headwaters states to Arizona, California and Nevada. This theme reiterates a point that CAP and Arizona water officials have stressed over the last year or so, that if push comes to shove in a legal battle, they have the 1922 Colorado River Compact on their side.\n\nWater shortages: Without a deal on the Colorado River, deeper cuts loom. How 9 Arizona cities will respond\n\nTwo river tutorial videos note that the compact awarded the three states of the Lower Basin 7.5 million acre-feet of water per year on average plus half of the smaller U.S. obligation to Mexico, and stated that the Upper Basin states would not deplete the river flow below that level.\n\nTwentieth century negotiators from the Upper Basin conceded the point out of fear that California and Arizona could otherwise claim most of the river due to their earlier use of the water, according to the videos. In wet years the Upper Basin could use up to 7.5 million acre-feet itself, but in dry years it would allow at least that much to flow to the more developed Southwestern cities and farm districts.\n\n“This was an obligation,” a narrator states, “meaning a guarantee.”\n\nRead more Colorado River stories: \n\nThat’s a point that modern negotiators for the Upper Basin states have disputed, saying that the Lower Basin continues to use most of the water while it’s climate change rather than their own consumption that has reduced the supply.\n\n“We do not have a delivery obligation under the terms of the compact,\" Colorado state river commissioner Becky Mitchell said last year during a meeting of the Upper Colorado River Commission, \"and will not agree to impose one on ourselves through agreement now.\"\n\nAs states gear up for a potential showdown in court, CAP and its Coalition for Protecting Arizona’s Lifeline are making clear that they will demand compact compliance if other states don’t cut their uses sufficiently.\n\n“The Colorado River Compact isn’t just history,” one of the videos asserts. “It’s the foundation of Western water law. And it still dictates how the West shares its most important resource — water.”\n\nBrandon Loomis covers environmental and climate issues for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com.

    "description": "Whoopi Goldberg wonders if maybe the FBI wanted Patel out of the country for a bit simply so they could get work done without him",
    "fullText": "The hosts of “The View” were largely disgusted by video footage showing FBI director Kash Patel partying with the U.S. men’s Olympic hockey team in Milan this weekend, but Whoopi Goldberg offered a more “positive” spin on it. The ABC moderator suggested that maybe the FBI told Patel to go, simply to get him out of the way.\n\nIn the footage, Patel is seen celebrating in the locker room with the victorious U.S. team on Sunday, yelling and drinking. But, a spokesperson for the FBI insisted Patel was in Milan on official business, and that’s why he used a taxpayer-funded plane to get there. His trip to the Olympics just happened to coincide.\n\n“Maybe the folks in the FBI said ‘Yeah Kash, go do that,’ so they don’t have to deal with him,” Whoopi suggested on Monday. “Because they know he doesn’t know what he’s doing. They know that he is incompetent, they know he’s just — he’s a joke. And he’s a joke to the rest of the world, and because, for most of the people working in the FBI, it is not a joke, they’re the ones whose eyes are on the ball.”\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the women at the table weren’t so optimistic. Host Ana Navarro was quick to remind viewers that Patel has been accused of misusing the FBI plane before, and that he wasn’t the only one.\n\n“The bottom line is these people have no care about wasting taxpayer money, and they behave — I don’t even know what Kash Patel was doing there,” she said.\n\nBeyond the use of taxpayer money, the optics of Patel’s trip bothered host Sara Haines more, considering how many things are going on in this country.\n\n“Right now, the world doesn’t feel settled or stable, and you’ve got the head of the FBI, and the visual of chugging a beer in a locker room,” she said. “I just think it doesn’t — he’s already under scrutiny for a thousand reasons, because this administration has not been the defining of competence.”\n\n“So I think when you have someone like that, with all that’s going on, and then that’s what you see, I just think it’s a bit of an insult to the American people,” Haines continued.\n\nHaines lamented that she misses the days when FBI directors weren’t so prominent, which prompted guest host Amanda Carpenter to explain why that was the case and precisely why she was so bothered by the footage as well.\n\n“The reason we don’t see them is because they’re usually busy,” she said. “There’s a lot of things to do. And god forbid something happens, and it could’ve been prevented, and it wasn’t because he was concerned about hanging around in the men’s hockey locker room.”\n\n“The View” airs weekdays at 11 a.m. ET on ABC.\n\nThe post ‘The View’: Whoopi Wonders If FBI Told Kash Patel to Go to the Olympics ‘So They Don’t Have to Deal With Him’ appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "While the Big Mac has been McDonald's premium sandwich for over 50 years, it wasn't on the menu when the chain opened its first restaurant in 1940.\n\nBack then, the idea of a premium burger conflicted with the broader concept of having a simple menu that could be delivered quickly. Back in those early days, the chain focused on a simple offering of burgers, cheeseburgers, fries, and sodas.\n\nIt was actually 27 years later when the chain's corporate leaders gave Michael James “Jim” Delligatti, a franchise operator, permission to launch a burger with two patties.\n\n\"The Big Mac made its debut on April 22 in 1967. According to The New York Times, the first newspaper ads for the specialty sandwich described it as a burger with 'two freshly ground patties, tangy melted cheese, crisp lettuce, pickle, and our own Special Sauce.' Early printed ads also often included the catch phrase 'A meal disguised as a sandwich,' to emphasize the burger’s size,\" Food & Wine reported.\n\nThe Big Mac was a hit that went on to become the chain's enduring signature offering. Since 1967, however, McDonald's has tried many times to create new signature, premium burgers, and aside from the Quarter Pounder with Cheese, the chain has failed many times.\n\nDespite failures like the Arch Deluxe, and Angus Third Pounders, McDonald's has decided to launch a new premium burger, the Big Arch.\n\nCFO Ian Borden has talked about why the company has struggled with higher-end offerings in the past.\n\n“We thought the opportunity was about premium burgers, which was wrong,” he said at a UBS Global Consumer and Retail Conference in 2024, Business Insider reported. “We weren’t successful.”\n\nInstead, he noted, customers want a larger, more satisfying burger. The Big Arch, which launches March 3, will attempt to meet that demand.\n\nMcDonald's will launch the Big Arch at a time when consumers are seeking value and when rivals, including Chipotle, have leaned into the added-protein trend.\n\n\"Protein is hot. Everybody is into protein,” McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski said in an Instagram video.\n\nIn addition to Chipotle's protein menu, Starbucks has added protein-infused coffees, and many chains are promoting protein on their menus.\n\nChipotle’s new consumer strategy raises eyebrows\n\nBurger King revives iconic kids’ meal toys after 22 years\n\nWalmart surprises shoppers with bold new restaurant offering\n\nThis year, 28.4% of U.S. restaurant menus call out “protein,” up from 5.9% a decade ago, according to Datassential, CNBC reported.\n\n“A lot of younger consumers are more proactive about their health habits, so they’re looking for ways to support health now but also to support their health in the future,” said Julia Mills, a food and drink analyst for market research firm Mintel told the news site.",

    "description": "The proposed legislation would revise the state’s criminal code to charge abortion patients with fetal homicide, a crime punishable by life imprisonment, life without parole, or, yes, the death penalt...",
    "fullText": "In a wildly ridiculous case of GOP lawmakers wanting to make everything about ultimately banning abortion and punishing abortion patients, two (he/him) lawmakers in Tennessee have proposed a bill that would charge abortion patients with homicide.\n\nRep. Jody Barrett (R) and Sen. Mark Pody (R) have introduced House Bill 570 and Senate Bill 738, which, if passed, would revise the state’s criminal code to charge abortion patients with fetal homicide. Some media outlets have highlighted that this could mean abortion patients could receive the death penalty, which Rep. Barrett denies. But even though it’s true that their bill doesn’t explicitly mention the death penalty, punishment for fetal homicide can include life imprisonment, life without parole, or, yes, the death penalty.\n\nThe bill also removes protection for pregnant people. For the most part, states with abortion bans look to punish the doctor, healthcare provider, or anyone who helps someone get an abortion, not the abortion seeker themselves. But HB 570 and SB 738 would consider any harm done to a fetus as harm done to an individual “born alive” or, in other words, prioritize protections for a fetus over the pregnant person carrying them.\n\nWhile the bill has yet to be voted on, it would take effect on July 1 if it passes—though it would not apply to any cases before then.\n\nA post shared by AGirlHasNoPresident (@agirlhasnopresident)\n\nThe legislation was initially announced by anti-abortion group Foundation to Abolish Abortion (FAA), and was endorsed by the Southern Baptist Convention—or the same denomination that made headlines in 2019 for overlooking and enabling a system of church leaders who raped, molested, and abused hundreds of victims. It was also backed by Reps. Bud Hulsey (R), Ed Butler (R), and Monty Fritts (R)—the latter of whom defended the bill by telling the Tennessee Holler in late January that “murder is murder. I know that’s hard for people to hear, and I don’t mean to be hard with it, I promise.”\n\nTennessee is one of 13 states with a near-total abortion ban, and also considered one of the strictest bans in the country—while it has a vague exception for the life of the mother, the ban has zero exceptions for rape or incest. In July, one doctor also used the states newly-passed Medical Ethics Defense Act to deny a pregnant woman prenatal care because she was unmarried.\n\nSo far in 2026, three states, in addition to Tennessee, have tried to advance legislation aiming to classify abortion as murder. Ten states tried (and failed) to do the same in 2025. It’s a risky move for the GOP ahead of the midterms—as abortion rights remain overwhelmingly popular in the U.S. But if they want to dig their own grave, they have our blessing to shovel away.\n\nLike what you just read? You’ve got great taste.  Plus, you’ll be supporting independent journalism—which, can you even imagine not supporting independent journalism in times like these? Yikes.",

    "fullText": "Are aliens real? The question has animated conspiracy theories for decades and enthralled at least one former president of the United States. In a recent interview, Barack Obama became the first American president to affirm a belief in the existence of extraterrestrial life, but insisted that it was not being stored inside the top-secret Area 51 military base in Nevada.\n\nFor Bill Diamond, the president and chief executive of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute (Seti) in California, Obama’s beliefs are hardly radical. Seti is the world’s leading research organisation dedicated to the scientific search for life beyond our planet – and Diamond insists that aliens are out there.\n\n“Oh yes,” says the 69-year-old scientist. “I do believe aliens are real. Definitely… It is one of the questions we ask if you want to get a job at Seti. If you don’t believe in aliens, there’s probably no point having a job with us.” Diamond’s job involves overseeing teams of scientists working on various projects and sifting through torrents of data from radio telescopes, searching for patterns that nature alone cannot explain.\n\nDiamond is careful, though, to draw distinctions in what he means by aliens. He is not talking about flying saucers and abductions. “Life is probably very common in the universe,” he says. “It’s when you start talking about complex organisms, intelligence and then, ultimately, technology that it becomes a different matter.\n\n“The conditions that would allow for [aliens] to exist, which are mostly time and evolution, are probably not going to be as common as the conditions that allow just basic cellular life to emerge. But statistically speaking, there will be many examples of intelligent and ultimately technological life on other worlds.”\n\nSo if they do exist, what will they look like? Public imagination of aliens in film and fiction are of little men flying through our skies in spaceships and etching elaborate patterns into wheat fields. Diamond smiles at the cliché. Reality, he believes, is both less theatrical and far harder to picture.\n\n“It’s very hard for us to imagine what aliens would be like,” he says, but points to the biodiversity of our own planet which may offer clues. Aliens may even be similar to creatures like jellyfish, he suggests. “We have jellyfish that, from my point of view, are pretty extraordinary looking, a bit like aliens – and various sea creatures and birds and reptiles and mammals and so forth.” On Earth alone, evolution has produced creatures that seem almost otherworldly. Octopuses with nervous systems that extend into their arms, whales capable of complex communication. If such diversity exists under one sky, perhaps it’s not so difficult to imagine stranger things still under another.\n\nThe same physical laws apply everywhere, Diamond notes. Gravity, chemistry and energy behave the same way across the known universe. This does not mean that aliens would look human but it does mean that they would be shaped by similar constraints. “They will obviously be shaped by their environment. A bigger planet than Earth is going to have a stronger gravitational field that’s going to require an organism that is capable of withstanding that gravitational pull so likely to be a more robust physical species. A planet slightly smaller would have a lower gravitational field that might allow for more spindly, less structurally solid beings.”\n\nSo if aliens do exist, how would they get in touch? Diamond is clear about what he does not expect. “I think crop circles are rather unlikely,” he says. “If you’re an advanced civilisation, and you are able to be here in some capacity, having a presence or impact on our planet and you wanted to get our attention or have the technology to visit Earth in some direct or impactful way, you have technology far beyond our ability to imagine.”\n\nSuch a civilisation would not stumble upon us. It would already know we were here. It would have studied our atmosphere, our radio signals. It would understand our level of technology and, almost certainly, our languages, Diamond says.\n\nInstead, he believes that contact is far more likely to come as a signal. “First contact is most certainly going to be an observation of a phenomena that nature doesn’t produce, that we can say that’s technology,” he says. “Certainly, if an advanced civilisation wanted to get in touch or contact us, radio transmission would be one of the most efficient and effective ways.”\n\nHowever, he jokes that even if aliens could contact us, they might not want to. “There is a joke amongst some researchers,” he says. “When alien spacecraft fly by the Earth, they lock the doors.”\n\nAt Seti, Diamond describes three ways that scientists search for life. The first is “in situ” exploration, sending instruments directly to a place of interest. Nasa’s Perseverance rover is currently exploring Mars to determine whether life exists or once existed there. That approach, for now, is limited to our own solar system. The second is remote observation. The James Webb Space Telescope can examine the atmospheres of distant planets up to around 1,000 light years away. The third is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence itself, though Diamond prefers a more precise description. What Seti is really seeking, he says, is extraterrestrial technology, something that acts as a proxy for life and intelligence.\n\nSo, when might all of this happen? “A Seti discovery could happen tomorrow, it might not happen for a thousand years, we don’t know,” Diamond says. “But one of the things we also say in this business is that the probability for finding life beyond Earth if you don’t look for it is zero.”\n\nThe challenge, he explains, is scale. If a signal was sent from Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to our solar system, it would only take four years to get here. Yet if an alien civilisation 1,000 light years away sent a message today, it would not reach us for 10 centuries. If we replied, our response would take just as long. Therefore, any exchange would unfold across generations rather than lifetimes.\n\nThat does not dampen his optimism. Humanity has been technologically capable for barely a century. In that time, we have gone from inventing radio to building space telescopes that can study worlds hundreds of light years away. Given enough time, our reach will expand.\n\nA confirmed detection would be historic. Diamond and his colleagues are already thinking about what it would mean. What will that discovery do to humanity as we know it? Change it for the better, Diamond hopes.\n\n“Whatever the nature of the discovery, almost certainly it will have an impact on us,” he says. “How will it impact religious beliefs and how will it impact governments and international diplomacy?”\n\nFor a man who spends his days contemplating vast distances and civilisations he may never see, the conclusion is strikingly human. “I hope we will be excited by the news and not threatened by it. Maybe people would finally realise we are all on this one planet as one little island and in this together so it might be smart for us to co-operate instead of fighting with each other.”\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "title": "I Ate a Banana Every Day for a Week and Here’s What Happened to My Body",
    "description": "As a dietitian, I know bananas are healthy. But what would happen if I decided to eat a banana every day for a week? Find out here.",
    "fullText": "As a dietitian, I know the importance of nutrition. Fruits, including bananas, provide essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber our bodies need. Despite this, I will admit that there are days when I don’t quite meet my own fruit quota. So in an effort to up my intake, I decided to challenge myself to eat a banana every day for a week.\n\nIf you’re like me, bananas are probably one of those foods you don’t think twice about. It’s easy to grab when running out the door, sweet enough to feel like a treat, and tasty in recipes from smoothies to banana bread. It would be simple to eat one every day, right? Here’s how my week with bananas unfolded and what I learned along the way.\n\nBefore getting started, I reflected on how often bananas naturally made an appearance in my diet. I realized that while I wasn’t eating them daily, I did enjoy them in several forms—blended into smoothies, sliced over yogurt, or spread with peanut butter as a quick snack. I figured eating one each day wouldn’t be difficult, and I was curious to see if I’d notice any tangible benefits.\n\nOver the next several days, I made a point to eat a banana a day. And honestly, it was easy to do, thanks in large part to the fact that bananas don't need to be refrigerated. Running to my car, I grabbed a banana to hang onto for when hunger pangs hit, and I was so happy I had it with me when I got hungry. One day for dessert, I sliced a banana over Icelandic Provisions salted caramel and banana skyr (tastes like banana pudding). And another day, I leaned on a classic peanut butter, banana, and honey sandwich at lunchtime. It required very little effort to add a banana to my days.\n\nAs the week went on, I noticed some pleasant changes. My energy levels felt steadier, especially during the busy mid-morning hours when I’d usually start searching for a quick pick-me-up. Bananas gave me a satisfying boost without the jitters or crash I sometimes get from sugary snacks. I felt more satisfied and less likely to reach for less healthy options.\n\nDigestively, things seemed to move along more smoothly, too. While the difference wasn’t extreme, it was certainly positive. I didn’t feel bloated like I do on occasion, and my bowel movements were regular. Plus, having that daily banana seemed to curb my sweet tooth, so I wasn’t tempted by mid-afternoon sweets as much. Overall, it was a simple change that left me feeling good!\n\nBananas are nutritional powerhouses. A medium-sized banana is considered a single serving. Here’s the breakdown of what you get in one medium banana:\n\nBananas also deliver plenty of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that deliver scientifically-backed benefits. Some of the most impressive ones include:\n\nPotassium is a critical nutrient that supports heart health and helps maintain proper blood pressure. One medium banana provides about 375 milligrams of potassium, making it a great way to meet your daily needs of about 2,600–3,400 milligrams. If you struggle with muscle cramps after workouts or occasional fatigue, adequate potassium intake might help ease those symptoms.\n\nBananas are an excellent source of dietary fiber, with one medium banana providing about 3 grams of fiber. Fiber plays a significant role in supporting regular bowel movements and promoting healthy gut bacteria. What’s more, slightly underripe bananas offer a unique benefit: They’re a source of prebiotic fiber. Prebiotic fiber feeds the “good” bacteria in your gut, which supports a healthy digestive system and can improve overall gut health.\n\nOne medium banana contains about 0.4 milligrams of vitamin B6, which is roughly 25% of the daily recommended intake for adults. The benefits of vitamin B6 are vast, but it particularly supports brain health, aiding the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine that regulate mood.\n\nBananas are predominantly made up of carbohydrates, with about 27 grams per medium banana. Thanks to their natural sugars and the fiber they contain, bananas provide a steady source of energy, making them ideal before a workout or as a pick-me-up snack.\n\nBananas contain several antioxidants, including vitamin C. Antioxidants help neutralize free radicals in the body, reducing oxidative stress and potentially lowering the risk of certain chronic diseases.\n\nBecause bananas are about 75% water, they contribute to your overall hydration. Combining their potassium content with this water content makes them a fantastic post-workout snack to help replenish lost electrolytes and fluids.\n\nWhile bananas are packed with nutrients, like any food, they’re best enjoyed in moderation. Eating too many bananas in a short timeframe may result in an overload of certain nutrients, such as potassium. Though this is rare, too much potassium (a condition called hyperkalemia) can lead to issues like heart irregularities if your kidneys can’t process the excess properly, or even dialysis.\n\nFor most people, eating one to two bananas a day is perfectly safe. If you focus on a balanced diet with a variety of fruits, it prevents overdoing any one thing.\n\nAnother thing to consider is bananas’ carbohydrate and sugar content. If you’re monitoring your blood sugar closely, be mindful of your portion size and pair bananas with some protein or fat, like almond butter or yogurt, to help support healthy blood glucose levels.\n\nBananas do make an excellent grab-and-go snack, but there are also many other easy and delicious ways to enjoy them on a regular basis. Here are some that I recommend:\n\nSmoothies: Slice a banana and toss it into your blender with yogurt, milk, and your favorite fruits for a quick breakfast or snack.\n\nOn toast: Pair banana slices with nut butter on whole grain toast for a filling, balanced meal.\n\nDesserts: Freeze ripe bananas to make creamy “nice cream” as a healthier alternative to ice cream.\n\nBaking: Use mashed bananas in recipes like banana bread or muffins for natural sweetness.\n\nToppings: Add sliced bananas to your cereal, oatmeal, or yogurt for some extra flavor and nutrients.\n\nAfter eating a banana every day for a week, I can confidently say that incorporating a banana into your daily routine comes with some impressive benefits. They’re convenient, affordable, and packed with essential nutrients like vitamins B6 and C that can boost energy, support digestion, and enhance overall health.\n\nThat said, balance and variety are key. I enjoy a wide range of fruits every day, including bananas, to ensure a diverse mix of nutrients. For those who don’t eat fruit regularly but enjoy bananas, they’re a simple, delicious, and budget-friendly way to start adding more nutrition to your diet. This versatile fruit truly punches above its weight!\n\nCan Apple Cider Vinegar Lead to Weight Loss?\n\nBobbi Brown Shares Her Top Face-Transforming Makeup Tips for Women Over 50",

    "fullText": "Civil unrest in Mexico following the death of a cartel leader led to flight cancellations on Sunday, Feb. 22, and Monday, Feb. 23, including flights to and from Mexico out of major California airports such as LAX and SFO.\n\nViolence erupted in western Mexico on Feb. 22 after a military operation that killed cartel leader Nemesio Oseguera, known as \"El Mencho.\"\n\nThe U.S. Embassy & Consulates in Mexico issued a security alert for the Mexican states of Jalisco, Tamaulipas, Michoacan, Guerrero and Nuevo Leon that urged U.S. citizens to shelter in place because of \"ongoing security operations and related road blockages and criminal activity.\"\n\nSeparately, a Northeast blizzard has canceled flights from Sky Harbor to Northeast cities like New York City, Boston, Newark and Philadelphia.\n\nLos Angeles International Airport, or LAX, had 128 flights out of and into the airport canceled as of 10 a.m. on Feb. 23, according to FlightAware.\n\nLAX's site showed that several flights departing had been canceled, with the majority being East Coast destinations including New York, Newark and Boston. Flights to Puerto Vallarta and Guadalajara were also canceled for Feb. 23.\n\nFlight Aware also showed that 86 flights into or out of San Francisco International Airport, or SFO, had been canceled on Monday, including all incoming flights from Boston Logan International, John F. Kennedy International and Newark Liberty International.\n\nA statement from the Mexican government said the Special Forces of the Mexican Army were conducting an arrest of Oseguera, head of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. The Mexican Army was attacked during their operation, leading to a shootout.\n\nSeven cartel members died in the operation, including Oseguera. Four died on the scene; three, including Oseguera, died while being transported to Mexico City.\n\nA wave of violence spread in response to Oseguera's death, including the burning of buses and blockages of roads.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs posted on X that U.S. citizens in locations affected by the violence should shelter in place, adding that most domestic and international flights were canceled in Puerto Vallarta and Guadalajara. Rideshares were suspended in Puerto Vallarta as well.\n\nOn Monday, 33 of Puerto Vallarta's 82 flights worldwide were canceled, representing about 40% of its operations, said Sam Rabindran, spokesperson for the aviation analytics company Cirium.\n\nAbout 16% of Guadalajara's Monday flights were canceled, 26 out of 162 flights worldwide, Rabindran added.\n\nLAX and SFO staff encourage passengers whose flights are disrupted to check their flight status with their airline before coming to the airport and following their airline for updates.\n\nAmerican Airlines and Southwest Airlines have flexible travel options for passengers affected by the Mexico unrest.\n\nAmerican is waiving fare differences and change fees for Puerto Vallarta and Guadalajara passengers scheduled to fly between Feb. 22-24 and can travel between now and March 3, as long as they maintain the same city pairs and cabin of service and book by Feb. 24.\n\nSouthwest passengers traveling out of Puerto Vallarta can rebook without paying a fare difference if they travel within 14 days of their original date of travel.\n\nMichael Salerno is an award-winning journalist who’s covered travel and tourism since 2014.

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Nick Reiner, the 32-year-old son of Hollywood luminary Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner, pleaded not guilty Monday to two counts of first-degree murder more than two months after their deaths, denying for the first time that he fatally stabbed his parents.\n\nReiner’s attorney, Deputy Public Defender Kimberly Greene, entered the plea on his behalf as he stood behind glass in an enclosed custody area of the packed Los Angeles courtroom.\n\nThe third of Rob Reiner’s four children, Nick Reiner has been held without bail since his arrest hours after beloved actor-director Reiner and photographer and producer Singer were found dead on Dec. 14 at their home in the upscale Brentwood section of Los Angeles.\n\nReiner appeared in court with a shaved head and light facial hair, wearing brown jail clothes. He talked to his lawyer briefly through the glass before the judge began the hearing. At one point a low door in the enclosure was opened and they crouched down and spoke face-to-face. During the hearing, he spoke only to answer yes when the judge asked if he waived his right for next steps of the case to proceed speedily.\n\nReiner was not wearing the suicide prevention smock he wore in his first court appearance in December days after his parent's killings. It was the third time he had been set to enter a plea, but issues surrounding the high-stakes, closely watched case, including a surprising change in defense lawyers, kept it from happening until Monday.\n\nThe judge told Reiner to return to court April 29 for the scheduling of a preliminary hearing where prosecutors will present evidence and a new judge will decide if it’s enough for Reiner to go to trial.\n\nThe case will now be handled by longtime Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Sam Ohta. He has had many prominent murder, manslaughter and public corruption cases in his courtroom in recent years, but none have drawn the national media attention this case has.\n\nDistrict Attorney Nathan Hochman said outside court that his office still hasn’t decided whether it will seek the death penalty for Reiner. Hochman said the death penalty decision “goes through a very rigorous process. We will be looking at all aggravating and mitigating circumstances.”\n\nReiner’s not guilty plea is common for criminal defendants at this stage of the case, whatever their longer-term plan might be.\n\nReiner’s former attorney, the high-profile private lawyer Alan Jackson, had to quit the case at the previous hearing, citing reasons beyond his and his client’s control that ethics wouldn't let him reveal. But in parting, he adamantly declared that “pursuant to the laws of California, Nick Reiner is not guilty of murder,” a stance made official by Reiner's plea Monday.\n\nAuthorities have said nothing about possible motives, and leaks in the case have been virtually nonexistent on both sides, leaving some of the most basic questions about the killing unanswered publicly.\n\nRob Reiner, 78, and Michele Singer Reiner, 70, died from “multiple sharp force injuries,” the LA County Medical Examiner said in initial findings. Authorities said they were killed hours before the bodies were discovered. A court order has prevented the public release of more details.\n\nDeputy District Attorney Habib Balian said Monday that his office is still awaiting the full autopsy report from the Medical Examiner, but all other evidence has been turned over to the defense.\n\nRob Reiner was a prolific director whose work included some of the most memorable and endlessly watchable movies of the 1980s and ’90s. His credits included “This is Spinal Tap,” “Stand By Me,” “A Few Good Men,” and “When Harry Met Sally… ,” during the production of which he met photographer Michele Singer. They wed soon after and were married for 36 years.",

    "fullText": "Chronically online MAGA Congressman Mike Lee should have just kept this one in the drafts.\n\nThe Utah senator, 54, shared a photo on X on Sunday afternoon of masked Mexican cartel members, calling out “leftists” in an attempted double standards gotcha moment regarding the idea that ICE agents should not wear masks to hide their identities.\n\n“Cartel hitmen wear masks,” Lee, from his personal @BasedMikeLee account, wrote. “Leftists aren’t complaining.”\n\nHowever, the senator was quick to delete his post after a few prominent Democrats responded, calling out how Lee’s argument unintentionally backfired.\n\n“Yes. Cartel hitmen wear masks. That’s why ICE shouldn’t,” wrote Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n“Oh dear Mike,” wrote Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy. “I literally couldn’t make our argument better than you do. The bad guys wear masks. The good guys don’t.”\n\nHawaii Senator Brian Schatz replied, “Mike, I would like ICE to have the same standards as a local police department, not cartel hitmen.”\n\nLee’s posting of polarizing rhetoric on social media, only to delete it later, is nothing new.\n\nIn June 2025, after Democratic Minnesota state representative Melissa Hortman and her husband were assassinated in their home by Trump voter Vance Boelter, the GOP congressman tweeted and deleted some incredulous accusations blaming liberals for her death.\n\nIn one deleted post, Lee called the killing a “Nightmare on Waltz Street” in a misspelled effort to pin the blame on the state’s Democratic governor and staunch Trump administration adversary, Tim Walz.\n\nIn another deleted post, Lee said, “This is what happens... When Marxists don’t get their way.”\n\nMS NOW host Lawrence O’Donnell said the senator was “not well” in the wake of his comments regarding the fatal shooting of Hortman and her husband.\n\n“Mike Lee appears to be in an agonizing mental struggle with how to be a human being,” O’Donnell, 74, said on The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell last year.\n\n“100 tweets a day is not healthy,” he continued, referring to the congressman’s avid social media usage as reported by the Salt Lake Tribune. “No United States senator actually doing the job of senator would have the time for 100 tweets a day, or even 10 tweets a day.”\n\nThough Lee deleted his posts about Hortman’s assassination, the Utah senator never officially apologized for his comments.",

    "description": "The CBO estimates that benefit reductions would start at 8% in 2040 and steadily climb to a 10% cut by 2056.",
    "fullText": "Recent policy changes and economic shifts have slashed 12 years off the projected life span of the trust fund that pays for Medicare Part A, according to a newly updated report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund is now slated to be entirely exhausted by 2040, even though the balance generally increases through 2031, as spending will begin to outstrip income in the following year.\n\nThis rapid deterioration of Medicare’s financial solvency represents a stark drop from the CBO’s previous estimate, which was published just last year, in March 2025. The dramatically shortened timeline means future retirees could face significant cuts to vital health care services far sooner than previously anticipated. As required by the Deficit Control Act, CBO Director Phillip Swagel noted the projections reflect the assumption benefits would be paid as scheduled even after the HI trust fund was exhausted.\n\nThe primary culprit for this accelerated depletion is a sharp reduction in the fund’s projected income, heavily driven by legislation passed over the last year. Specifically, the 2025 reconciliation act (Public Law 119-21, more commonly known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act) significantly reduced the revenues the trust fund normally receives from taxing Social Security benefits. This legislation lowered tax rates and established a temporary deduction for taxpayers age 65 or older. Consequently, this major policy shift enacted during the Trump administration has directly contributed to starving the Medicare safety net of critical future funding.\n\nThe HI trust fund is the financial backbone for Medicare Part A, which covers essential services including inpatient hospital care, stays in skilled nursing facilities, home health care, and hospice care. Over the next 30 years, the fund is expected to rely on the Medicare payroll tax for about three-quarters of its annual income, with another roughly one-eighth derived from income taxes on Social Security benefits.\n\nHowever, the recent tax cuts are not the only factor draining the fund. The CBO also cited decreased projections for payroll tax revenues, warning it had to adjust their models to account for lower expected worker earnings. Furthermore, because the trust fund will have smaller balances going forward, it will generate less interest income, creating a compounding negative effect on its overall finances.\n\nOn the other side of the ledger, Medicare spending is rising faster than anticipated. The CBO noted per-enrollee spending in Medicare Part A’s fee-for-service program in 2025, along with 2026 bids by Medicare Advantage plan providers, both came in higher than expected.",

He was declared dead at the scene.\n\nThe police added that “his death is currently being treated as unexplained\" and an investigation is underway. It is suggested that the victim may have underwent a cosmetic procedure prior to his death, the cause of which is unknown.\n\nA 43-year-old man and a 52-year-old woman were arrested on Friday, February 20, on suspicion of manslaughter.

As reported by ITV News, he was due to answer bail this March.\n\nSince starting his plastic surgery journey at age 19, Parke underwent dozen of cosmetic procedures, including multiple nose jobs, filler in his neck, lips and jawline, a BBL and a chin implant.\n\nIn a 2016 interview on the British daytime show This Morning, Parke said he \"never hated\" himself, but over time, plastic surgery became a \"hobby.\" Before his death, he appeared on E!'s Botched twice to address his lip filler and later his liposuction and the appearance of his nose.\n\nParke's sister Sharnelle wrote on Instagram that their family is \"numb, shocked and heartbroken\" over his death in a tribute on Instagram.",

    "description": "Rep. Lauren Boebert called on Rep. Tony Gonzales to resign on Monday, hours after 24sight News reported on inappropriate messages he sent to a staffer.",
    "fullText": "LEFT: Lauren Boebert (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call via AP Images) RIGHT: Tony Gonzales (Francis Chung/POLITICO via AP Images)\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) called on Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-TX) to resign on Monday, hours after 24sight News reported on inappropriate text messages that Gonzales sent to Regina Santos-Aviles, a former staffer who committed suicide by self-immolation last September.\n\nThe new messages — in which Gonzales asked Santos-Aviles to send him “a sexy pic” and fantasized about being “On top pinning your legs” — were produced less than a week after another former Gonzales employee who described himself as Santos-Aviles’s “best friend” told the  San Antonio Express-News that Santos-Aviles had admitted the affair to him, and that she had been battling depression ever since her husband found out about the relationship, causing the congressman to “abruptly cut her off.” The staffer also produced text messages in which Santos-Aviles admitted to the affair.\n\nGonzales has repeatedly denied the allegations that he had an affair with Santos-Aviles, and blamed last week’s story on his primary opponent in a statement that read:\n\nMs. Santos-Aviles was a kind soul who devoted her life to making the community a better place. Her efforts led to improvements in school safety, healthcare, and rural water like never before. It’s shameful that Brandon Herrera [Gonzales’s primary opponent] is using a disgruntled former staffer to smear her memory and score political points, conveniently pushing this out the very day early voting started. I am not going to engage in these personal smears and instead will remain focused on helping President Trump secure the border and improve the lives of all Texans.\n\nAt least one of his colleagues is not convinced of his innocence, though. Boebert called on Gonzales to resign after the publication of the incriminating text messages.\n\n.@RepTonyGonzales, RESIGN! https://t.co/sOjPAt0CWS\n\n— Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) February 23, 2026\n\nBoebert’s demand is notable given the fact that Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) and the GOP command the smallest majority in nearly a century. If Gonzales were to resign, it would shrink further to 217-214, with four vacancies. The tight margin of error is particularly notable given the fact that some Republicans, including Reps. Don Bacon (R-NE) and Thomas Massie (R-KY), have proven willing to defect and vote with the Democrats on myriad issues.\n\nThe post JUST IN: Lauren Boebert Demands Fellow House Republican Resign Amid Growing Scandal first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "As a full-time travel writer and content creator, I'm eager to explore as much of the world as possible. And although I often prioritize visiting new destinations, I can't help but return to Greece again and again.\n\nI adore the country, and over the last five years, I've visited 27 islands — some of them multiple times. However, a few just didn't capture my heart in the same way.\n\nHere are three Greek islands I'd return to and two I'd skip in the future.\n\nSymi is easily one of my favorite Greek Islands because it feels more lowkey than some of the more famous spots like Mykonos or Santorini.\n\nFor stunning views overlooking the bay, I recommend hiking up the Kali Strata's hundreds of stairs. I also suggest joining a full-day boat trip with Poseidon cruises or hopping on a water taxi to visit one of the nearby beaches.\n\nIn my opinion, Milos has some of the most stunning beaches in Greece.\n\nOne of the most well-known spots is Sarakiniko Beach, which is famous for its lunar landscape — a series of smooth, white, volcanic rock formations that resemble the surface of the moon.\n\nI recommend renting a car to explore Milos by land, but don't skip a boat trip around the island as well — some of the best swim spots are only accessible from the water.\n\nSeveral tiny fishing villages also add a unique factor to this island. In some of them, traditional boathouses have been renovated into cozy, waterfront villas and hotels. I recommend booking one for a truly immersive experience.\n\nSkiathos is a charming island filled with great local shops and some of the best Greek food I've had during my travels. It also has a lively nightlife scene, with plenty of bars and clubs that stay open late.\n\nDuring the day, you can hop on a boat or a bus to explore the many beaches in the area. In the evening, I recommend taking advantage of lengthy happy hours at the many cocktail bars offering sunset views.\n\nIf you love \"Mamma Mia,\" Open Air Cinema hosts special screenings of the movie — after all, parts of it were filmed on the island. I recommend grabbing tickets early because they sell out quickly.\n\nMykonos is known for its upscale beach clubs, lively bars, and cute old town. It delivers on all of these fronts, but in my opinion, it does so at a cost.\n\nIt's known as one of the pricier Greek islands to visit, and although I enjoyed my time there, it's not somewhere I feel the need to go back to.\n\nInstead, I recommend taking a multi-day Greek Island sailing trip that stops in Mykonos. That way, you can see it and experience some of the hype, but you don't have to stay for more than one night.\n\nGoing into my trip, I knew that Kos was more touristy than other islands I've visited. However, although it's beautiful, I ultimately found it to be underwhelming.\n\nInstead of unique gifts, I found that most of the old town was filled with typical tourist shops. The beaches were OK, but also seemed less picturesque compared to those I've visited on other islands.\n\nSince Kos has an international airport, I think it's best suited as a starting point for reaching other destinations.\n\nThis story was originally published on September 19, 2024, and most recently updated on February 23, 2026.",

    "fullText": "Peter Mandelson, the United Kingdom's former Ambassador to the United States, was arrested by the Metropolitan Police on Monday in the continued fallout over the Epstein files.\n\nThe police confirmed they had arrested a 72-year-old \"former government minister\" on suspicion of misconduct in public office, following search warrants at two addresses, including Camden. The description matches that of Mandelson.\n\nDocuments released by the Department of Justice in January showed Mandelson sharing sensitive government information with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nIn emails sent while Mandelson was a government minister, the politician forwarded internal memos to Epstein, tipping him off about changes in tax rules, the sale of government assets during the UK financial crisis, and the European Union's bailout of Greece's economy.\n\nThe documents also contain a record of Epstein sending money to Mandelson's husband, Reinaldo Avila da Silva.\n\nLast year, he was fired as ambassador after more about his ties to Epstein became public, and he subsequently left the British Labour Party.\n\nEarlier this month, the Metropolitan Police announced an investigation into Mandelson.\n\nMandelson has denied any illegal activity and told The Times of London that his husband's acceptance of funds from Epstein reflected \"a lapse in our collective judgment.\"\n\nLast week, King Charles' younger brother, the former Prince Andrew, was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office over government documents he shared with Epstein. The former prince, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, has denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe scandal around Mandelson has grown to affect Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has faced backlash for appointing Mandelson to the ambassador position in 2024, despite knowing about his ties to Epstein. Several of Starmer's senior staff members have quit over the revelations.",

    "title": "Why a veteran strategist says signs of stress among richer Americans mean it's a good time to buy stocks",
    "description": "The wealthy are becoming worried about the US economy more rapidly than lower-income households. A Wall Street veteran says it's that's bullish for stocks.",
    "fullText": "The S&P 500 could be set to break out of its anemic trading range, according to a veteran Wall Street strategist.\n\nThe key metric to watch isn't some piece of technical analysis or a big earnings update. Rather, it's the growing feeling of economic unease among high-earning Americans, according to Jim Paulsen.\n\nThe S&P 500 is roughly flat since the start of 2026 as investors weigh the market impact of Trump's uncertain tariff regime and AI disruption fears. Jim Paulsen, former chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group, says his new market indicator, which he dubs the poor/rich sentiment measure, has successfully forecast recent market rallies and is signaling a potential upswing is on the horizon.\n\nLower-income households were seen by forecasters as a weak spot in the economy for some time, but their mood has been brightening of late. At the same time, high earners have become more downbeat. This narrowing of the sentiment gap, Paulsen says, is a buy signal.\n\nPaulsen compares consumer confidence in the economy by income level to find a daily confidence ratio that he then combines with a ratio of Walmart's stock performance relative to the S&P Global Luxury stock price index.\n\nPaulsen overlaid his poor/rich sentiment indicator over the S&P 500 to assess it as an indicator for market performance.\n\n\"The Poor/Rich sentiment indicator has spiked higher 8 previous times since 2018 — in late-2018, October 2019, March 2020, May 2022, October 2022, November 2023, September 2024, and in April 2025. During each of these previous spikes in the Poor/Rich sentiment indicator, the S&P 500 was at a level which represented a good buy! \"\n\nSince the end of 2025, Paulsen's indicator has climbed. The measure's spike since December shares similarities with increases seen at the end of the 2022 bear market and at the 2020 pandemic lows.\n\nThe strategist ties the indicator's success to the idea that if the high-income cohort is losing faith in the economy, then the stock market is often at a low point. Paulsen highlights a downturn in Bloomberg's US billionaires relative total return index, which he says could be a signal that the rich are losing faith in the market.\n\n\"We seem to be in a relatively rare period when the Rich are losing confidence faster than the Poor … when the rich start complaining more than the poor, it's often been a good time to step up and buy some equities,\" the strategist said.\n\nPaulsen warned investors against using a single gauge, but said it may be a good time to assess equity exposure.\n\n\"If you are underinvested, perhaps it's worth considering taking advantage of recent volatility by adding to your equity exposure during selloffs,\" he wrote on his Substack post.",

    "description": "Over 9,000 flights have been canceled since Sunday as a snowstorm blankets the East Coast. FlightAware's Misery Map shows where chaos is piling up.",
    "fullText": "Even if you could make it to the airport as winter storm Hernando blankets runways and aircraft, your flight probably wasn't going anywhere.\n\nA \"misery map\" from the aviation-tracking website Flightaware shows where disruptions are piling up fastest. So far, more than 9,000 flights have been canceled across the US since Sunday. More disruptions are expected on Tuesday.\n\nCirium data shows that of the about 25,000 scheduled US flights on Monday, roughly 20% aren't taking off, compared with 1% on a typical day. It was about the same on Sunday.\n\nThe Northeast is bearing the brunt of the storm, with nearly every flight from Philadelphia to Boston canceled. More than half of the roughly 750 daily departures from Washington, DC-area airports have also been scrapped, mostly from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, the closest to the city.\n\nThe misery map doesn't currently show some smaller airports like Providence, Rhode Island, and Hartford, Connecticut, that have been similarly slammed by snow.\n\nThe disruptions — especially at busy hub airports — have caused a ripple effect across the national network, stranding travelers booked on subsequently canceled inbound planes far from home. This includes thousands of people on about 550 flights from abroad.\n\nWith only a handful of international flights per day, airlines may deploy additional planes to shuttle passengers back once the storm passes. Airlines made a similar call in January when people got stranded in the Caribbean amid a US raid on Venezuela.\n\nEven after the snow lets up, it could take airlines days to get back on schedule.\n\nAirport staff — many of whom may be stuck at home — may struggle to get to work quickly. Snow on the tarmacs, taxiways, and runways must be removed and full inspections completed before planes can safely land or take off. And aircraft must be de-iced and cleared of snow before each departure — processes that can take hours in heavy storms.\n\nTravelers shouldn't expect compensation for the chaos.\n\nAirlines classify the snowstorm as a \"force majeure\" event — situations outside their control that force flight delays, cancellations, or diversions. Travelers may receive a voucher for meals or hotel accommodations as a gesture of goodwill, but it's not required by federal law. Still, it doesn't hurt to ask.\n\nIf you booked your flight with a travel credit card, such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve or the American Express Platinum, you may be able to recoup expenses through their dedicated reimbursement programs.\n\nTravelers can get refunds for canceled flights (so long as they choose not to fly), and airlines are waiving change fees and fare differences as they suspend operations in certain airports. The changed flight must typically fall within a specific time window and be to and from the itinerary's original airports.\n\nIt has been a hectic 24 hours for air travel.\n\nAbout 40 Mexico‑bound flights were canceled or diverted on Sunday as carriers suspended operations to resort destinations amid cartel‑related unrest — adding to the logistical chaos already caused by the snowstorm.\n\nA confusing TSA PreCheck policy — which ended in the lanes remaining open, even after Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced they'd close amid the partial government shutdown — didn't help.",

    "description": "The US Navy relieved the captain of the destroyer USS Truxton after it collided with a supply ship.",
    "fullText": "The US Navy abruptly fired the commander of guided-missile destroyer USS Truxtun after his ship collided with a logistics vessel during a resupply operation at sea earlier this month.\n\nRear Adm. Carlos Sardiello, who leads US Naval Forces Southern Command and 4th Fleet, relieved Cmdr. James Koffi on Sunday.\n\nThe ship collision that resulted in a \"loss of confidence\" and cost Koffi his command occurred during a replenishment-at-sea operation involving USNS Supply, a fast combat support ship, the Navy said in a statement on the relief.\n\nThe cause of the ship collision remains under investigation but highlights the risks of at-sea logistics and the challenges of keeping naval forces on the move.\n\nReplenishments-at-sea are resupplies in which one ship sails closely alongside another to transfer supplies such as fuel or ammunition. These missions are routine operations that support global naval activity by allowing vessels to remain at sea, rather than forcing them to return to port.\n\nAt-sea replenishments carry risks, though, that can be exacerbated by a range of factors beyond proximity, such as sea state, crew fatigue, communication breakdowns, and equipment failures.\n\nTwo personnel sustained minor injuries during the February 11 collision between the Truxton and Supply.\n\nKoffi, who took over the Truxtun just over a year ago, has been reassigned to Commander, Naval Surface Group Middle Atlantic. The Truxton, which had been deployed for under a month when the ship collision happened, is in port in Ponce, Puerto Rico. The Navy said the ship is undergoing repairs.\n\nCmdr. Taylor Auclair, who most recently served at US Fleet Forces Command, has been assigned to command the Truxtun.\n\n\"The Navy maintains the highest standards for leaders and holds them accountable when those standards are not met,\" the Navy said in a press release.\n\nA near-miss during a resupply in 2024 resulted in the relief of the commander of USS John S. McCain, another destroyer. And last year, the Navy relieved the captain of an aircraft carrier after it collided with a civilian merchant vessel during a deployment that experienced a string of major accidents, including the loss of three fighter jets, including one to a friendly-fire incident.\n\nThe Truxton deployed to Caribbean waters as part of President Donald Trump's pressure campaign against Venezuela and narcotics trafficking. The administration sent nearly a dozen warships, among other combat assets, to the region late last year. The military launched strikes on suspected drug-smuggling boats, seized oil tankers, and carried out a January raid inside Venezuela that resulted in the capture of its former president, Nicolás Maduro.\n\nMore recently, roughly a dozen Navy warships have been directed to the Middle East as the administration has shifted focus to a ballooning buildup in the region. As of last week, the Truxton is now one of just five ships remaining in the Caribbean",

    "fullText": "Newly captured satellite imagery shows widespread fires, roadblocks, and cars burning in a Costco parking lot after cartel violence rocked the Mexican resort town of Puerto Vallarta, the company that took the photos said.\n\nThe imagery, captured Sunday by US spatial intelligence firm Vantor and analyzed by Business Insider, underscores the scale of the chaos gripping Puerto Vallarta, nestled along the Pacific Ocean in Mexico's Jalisco state, and its hundreds of thousands of residents.\n\nFires and smoke can be seen across the city, including along a coastal road, in a Costco parking lot, at a shopping mall, and at an Autozone. Roadblocks are also visible in the imagery. Puerto Vallarta is a major tourist destination, especially in the winter.\n\nMexican forces carried out an operation Sunday that killed Nemesio \"El Mencho\" Oseguera Cervantes, the notorious leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel who had a $15 million US bounty on his head.\n\nPresident Donald Trump designated the cartel as a foreign terrorist organization just last year. Karoline Leavitt, a White House spokesperson, said the US provided intelligence support to Mexico to assist with the operation, although she did not specify how.\n\nThe Trump administration has made it a priority to combat Latin American cartels, encouraging heads of state to have a tougher stance against them and even using military force against alleged drug boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean Sea.\n\nThree additional cartel members were killed, three were wounded, and two more were arrested in the operation, which took place in Talpalpa, a town in the Jalisco state, Leavitt said. Mexico said three soldiers were hurt in the raid.\n\nRetaliatory violence erupted in cities across Mexico following the raid, with organized criminal groups and suspected cartel members clashing with security forces and setting fire to cars and buildings.\n\nThe US State Department urged American citizens in some locations to shelter in place and said most domestic and international flights were canceled in Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta, where scenes of the violence were shared widely on social media.\n\nDozens of suspected cartel members and security personnel have been killed in the violence, with Mexican authorities scrambling to regain control of the chaos.",

    "description": "Bank of America says investors don't need to worry about the private credit market, despite recent Blue Owl headlines that have dented confidence.",
    "fullText": "Canary in the coal mine. The next financial crisis. \"Cockroaches\". Those are all phrases used in recent, panicked discussions of private credit, but according to Bank of America, commentary from the bears is creating a stream of misinformation that's to blame for the sector's recent troubles.\n\nThe Financial Times last week reported that Blue Owl, an alternative asset manager focused on private credit, froze withdrawals from one of its funds offered to retail investors, generating fresh concerns about the market and sparking comparisons to the financial crisis.\n\nEconomist Mohamed El-Erian said the situation could be a \"canary-in-the-coalmine\" moment akin to 2007, before the onset of the Great Financial Crisis. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he's \"concerned\" and watching the Blue Owl news. Adding to the troubles, Business Insider reported that Blue Owl was unable to finance a data center set to be occupied by CoreWeave.\n\nBlue Owl stock has fallen more than 16% in five days.\n\nYet, Bank of America analysts wrote on Monday that they're not worried about private credit, indicating they're surprised so many are. They say investors' worries are being driven by a lack of understanding about what private credit is.\n\n\"There is a significant level of misinformation weighing on OWL and the private credit industry which has led to a particularly attractive buying opportunity for OWL,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nBank of America's price target for Blue Owl stock implies a more than 100% upside.\n\nIt said there are a few reasons it remains upbeat on the sector. For one, BofA said that Blue Owl's data center exposure is separate from the rest of its private credit business. It also believes credit quality in the software sector is strong. Finally, last year's high-profile blowups of First Brands and Tricolor Holdings weren't precursors to a wider spate of private credit crises.\n\nBofA was bullish on the private credit space coming into 2026, and it remains upbeat in the long term.\n\n\"We continue to view private credit as an attractive contributor to a US retirees' portfolio given the high returns, downside protection and monthly dividends and it has even outperformed most equity strategies over the last three years,\" the bank wrote.",

    "description": "Meta alignment director Summer Yue hooked OpenClaw up to her inbox. Then, the bot tried to delete her emails. Yue chalked it up to a \"rookie mistake.\"",
    "fullText": "Even the people hired to keep AI aligned can't always keep it in line.\n\nMeta's Summer Yue has been testing OpenClaw, a popular open-source AI agent capable of working 24/7 on behalf of its users. Then the bot went out of control, according to photos she posted on X. It ended up planning to delete her emails — and wouldn't stop after being directed to.\n\nIn her X post, Yue's OpenClaw bot said that it would \"trash EVERYTHING in inbox older than Feb 15 that isn't already in my keep list.\"\n\nYue tried multiple times to stop it. First, she messaged the AI agent, \"Do not do that.\" As the bot kept planning to delete her inbox, she wrote, \"STOP OPENCLAW.\"\n\n\"I couldn't stop it from my phone,\" Yue wrote in her post. \"I had to RUN to my Mac mini like I was defusing a bomb.\"\n\nNothing humbles you like telling your OpenClaw “confirm before acting” and watching it speedrun deleting your inbox. I couldn’t stop it from my phone. I had to RUN to my Mac mini like I was defusing a bomb. pic.twitter.com/XAxyRwPJ5R\n\nYue had previously tried OpenClaw on her \"toy inbox,\" where she wrote that the bot worked well and gained her trust. Testing it on her \"real inbox,\" the bot had to compact a much larger set of emails. She instructed it not to take action without approval, but OpenClaw lost the prompt during compaction, she wrote.\n\nYue joined Meta after its deal with Scale AI as a director of alignment of its Superintelligence Labs division, according to her LinkedIn profile. That's left some critics on social media confused: why would someone studying AI safety use such an AI agent that has previously drawn security concerns?\n\nUnlike other AI agents, OpenClaw does not need human approval to sign off on actions. It was also vibe-coded, and that combined with OpenClaw's level of system access has led some AI researchers to question the bot's security. AI researcher Gary Marcus told Business Insider that it was like \"giving full access to your computer and all your passwords to a guy you met at a bar who says he can help you out.\"\n\nOpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger, who has since been hired by OpenAI, recently said in a podcast interview that he was prioritizing building out additional security safeguards over ease-of-use features.\n\nThough it's not altogether surprising that someone working in AI would test out one of the buzziest AI products of the last year, some X users criticized Yue for hooking up OpenClaw to her real email in the first place. Ben Hylak, the cofounder of Raindrop AI and an Apple alum, posted a screenshot of her LinkedIn. \"This should terrify you,\" he wrote. \"What is Meta doing?\"\n\n\"Somewhat concerning that a person whose job is AI alignment is surprised when an AI doesn't precisely follow verbal instructions,\" another X user wrote.\n\nYou can't make this up. And this happened to a someone working on safety and alignment at META Superintelligence Lab.\n\nI don't get how people can let AI agents go on unsupervised like this.\n\nI'll stick to my supervised use of AI for now. pic.twitter.com/tWvQFd1NP5\n\nYue and Meta didn't respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nYue also isn't the only Meta employee to toy around with OpenClaw; creator Peter Steinberger said that Mark Zuckerberg played with the tool for a week and even sent feedback. While Meta courted him, Steinberger later accepted a job offer from OpenAI.\n\nIn the comments of Yue's post, someone asked about her AI alignment role. \"Were you intentionally testing its guardrails or did you make a rookie mistake?\" they wrote.\n\n\"Rookie mistake tbh,\" Yue responded. \"Turns out alignment researchers aren't immune to misalignment.\"",

The company said it hoped these talks between Paramount and WBD would \"fully and finally resolve\" the monthslong saga that it said has been an \"ongoing distraction\" for both Netflix and WBD shareholders.\n\nAs of midday Monday, Paramount hasn't made its \"best and final\" bid for WBD, though it doesn't necessarily have to rush. That's because the seven-day window that Netflix granted Warner Bros. is to talk with Paramount, not the deadline for Paramount to raise its bid.\n\n\"Anyone can make an offer up to the shareholder vote,\" a person familiar with the WBD-Paramount negotiations told Business Insider.\n\nWBD's shareholder vote is on March 20. At that meeting, investors can choose to either approve or reject the Netflix deal, or they can abstain. WBD shareholders who prefer Paramount's offer can tender their shares to Ellison and company. Paramount has set a March 2 deadline for that, though it could be extended. If Paramount gets a majority of shares, it could shift WBD's course toward its own offer over Netflix's.\n\nThat means Paramount's real deadline for submitting its best offer is weeks away, though the company could raise its bid well before that. If Paramount raises its offer, Netflix will have four days to respond.\n\nWBD has said it prefers Netflix's all-cash offer of $27.75 per share for its studio and streaming assets over Paramount's proposal of $30 per share for the entire company, including its cable TV networks.\n\nWBD warned last week that if it went with Paramount, its employees could quit in droves, ahead of what could be a major round of layoffs under Ellison. Paramount has said it plans to create $6 billion in cost savings, which would include layoffs, compared to $2 billion or $3 billion from Netflix.\n\nParamount has argued that Netflix is the biggest threat to Hollywood since it has the most streaming subscribers and dominates viewership share among paid streamers. Netflix's counterargument is that it also competes against YouTube and other free streamers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is another variable. Trump said in December that Netflix's acquisition of Warner Bros. \"could be a problem\" due to its market share, before saying in early February that he had decided he \"shouldn't be involved\" in the regulatory process.\n\nA White House spokesperson told Business Insider last week that Trump \"has great relationships with all parties in this potential transaction and remains neutral in this process with no preference for either bidder.\"\n\nThen on Saturday, Trump said Netflix should remove Susan Rice from its board \"or pay the consequences.\" On a podcast, Rice, a former senior White House official under Obama and Biden, criticized the Trump administration and companies that \"take a knee\" under pressure from the president.\n\nNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos shrugged off the president's remarks on Monday, saying that the streaming titan's bid for Warner Bros. is \"not a political deal.\"",

    "description": "Anthropic's Claude is allegedly going to destroy  a bunch of jobs. Unless you look at the startup's job listings.",
    "fullText": "I've seen some silly predictions about the future of work lately. If you're worried about AI destroying jobs, take a quick trip through Anthropic's careers page. It's one of my favorite spots on the internet right now.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei is among the loudest voices warning that AI could erase many white-collar jobs. He's been especially outspoken about coding, given Anthropic's Claude Code is so powerful.\n\nA successful editor once told me to focus on what people and companies do, not what they say. So let's look at the jobs Anthropic is trying to fill right now.\n\nTop of the list: software engineering roles. The AI company with the most effective coding-automation machine on earth is looking to hire more than 100 coding experts.\n\nThis job posting stood out to me. Anthropic is hiring an iOS developer to build mobile apps. I thought you could just vibe-code apps these days? Apparently not.\n\nBoris Cherny, the creator of Claude Code, was asked about this recently. If this AI tool is writing most or all of Anthropic's code these days, why is the company still hiring so many software developers?\n\n\"Someone has to prompt the Claudes, talk to customers, coordinate with other teams, decide what to build next,\" Cherny replied on X. \"Engineering is changing and great engineers are more important than ever.\"\n\nLet that sink in. Software development is probably the job that is most disrupted by AI. Models have gotten good at coding because it's relatively easy to evaluate good versus bad outputs. That's because the code either works, or it doesn't, when deployed. This creates clear yes/no signals that are really valuable for training and fine-tuning new AI models.\n\nSo if Anthropic is still hiring more than 100 software engineers, then other types of jobs that are less impacted by AI should probably endure as well.\n\nProving my point, Anthropic has 32 finance jobs open, along with 33 in marketing, 16 in legal, and more than 100 in sales.\n\nI'm not just telling you this to make you feel better. When extreme AI job predictions are made, it leads to dumb ideas such as banning data center construction.\n\nSo, take a breath. AI is just a (powerful) tool to help humans get more work done. I'll leave you with final thoughts on this topic from Jensen Huang (who, by the way, is hiring humans like crazy).\n\nIn a recent interview, he argued that fears of mass job destruction often confuse the \"tasks\" involved in a job with the broader \"purpose\" of the role. AI, in his view, changes how tasks get done, but the purpose remains the same. And that means, the technology probably won't destroy jobs and could even increase demand for the people responsible for outcomes at work.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "\"These campaigns are growing in intensity and sophistication,\" Anthropic said as part of its lengthy statement.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic says its Chinese competitors are stealing from the AI startup to gain an edge in the global AI race.\n\nOn Monday, Anthropic said three of China's biggest AI labs, DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot AI, were \"illicitly\" using Claude \"to improve their own models,\" through a process known as distillation.\n\n\"These campaigns are growing in intensity and sophistication,\" Anthropic said as part of its lengthy statement on Monday. \"The window to act is narrow, and the threat extends beyond any single company or region. Addressing it will require rapid, coordinated action among industry players, policymakers, and the global AI community.\n\nAnthropic said the distillation efforts were \"industrial-scale campaigns\" that included roughly 24,000 fraudulent Claude accounts that generated over 16 million exchanges \"in violation of our terms of service and regional access restrictions.\"\n\nDistillation is the process of training a less powerful model on the output of a more powerful model. The practice is a legitimate way that many US companies use to train their models for public release. Increasingly, major US companies are also stating that their Chinese competitors are improperly using the practice to steal their work.\n\nIn January 2025, OpenAI said DeepSeek may have \"inappropriately\" used OpenAI's outputs to train their models. Earlier this month, Google disclosed it had \"identified an increase in model extraction attempts or 'distillation attacks.'\"\n\n\"Competitors can use it to acquire powerful capabilities from other labs in a fraction of the time, and at a fraction of the cost, that it would take to develop them independently,\" Anthropic said on Monday.\n\nAnthropic disclosed remarkable detail about the extent to which DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot AI \"illicitly\" used their systems. Claude is not available for commercial access in China, though Anthropic said the rival labs found workarounds.\n\nAmong the notable findings, Anthropic said DeepSeek sought to create \"censorship-safe alternatives to policy-sensitive queries.\" The company also said it detected MiniMax's campaign \"while it was still active,\" giving them an in-depth look at what their competitor was doing.\n\n\"When we released a new model during MiniMax's active campaign, they pivoted within 24 hours, redirecting nearly half their traffic to capture capabilities from our latest system,\" Anthropic said.\n\nRepresentatives for DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot AI did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nBeyond cheating in the AI, Anthropic said improper distillation poses security risks because less-trained models may lack the proper safeguards, such as those to prevent the development of bioweapons.\n\nIn response to such distillation campaigns, Anthropic said it has built in \"behavioral fingerprinting systems,\" shares data with other AI companies on what to look out for, and continues to develop additional countermeasures.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei recently wrote that leading models are approaching the point where, without proper safeguards, they could help direct someone in building a bioweapon.\n\nAmodei is also an outspoken advocate of US-export controls, a topic that divides some leading tech CEOs. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has repeatedly said that restricting US companies, including his own, from selling advanced chips to China won't curb China's AI advancements.\n\n\"Distillation attacks therefore reinforce the rationale for export controls: restricted chip access limits both direct model training and the scale of illicit distillation,\" Anthropic said.\n\nAnthropic has also faced allegations of using copyrighted material to train its models. In January, the Washington Post reported new details about an endeavor at the company called Project Panama, which the company reportedly described as \"our effort to destructively scan all the books in the world.\" Last year, Anthropic settled a class-action lawsuit brought by the authors and publishers of some of the books for $1.5 billion. As part of the settlement, the company didn't admit any wrongdoing.",

    "description": "222 wants to grow beyond helping people make new friends. The AI-powered startup also wants to help people find love and maintain relationships.",
    "fullText": "It'd be nice to meet someone the old-fashioned way: Passing by them on the street, meeting at a restaurant, or sharing an exchange at a party.\n\nHowever, apps dominate the modern dating experience, replacing kismet meet-cutes with scrolling and DMs.\n\n222, a startup focused on relationship building with the help of AI, thinks it can bring back the spontaneity of making a new friend — or falling in love.\n\n\"We're trying to get as close as possible to you walking into someplace with other people there, and connection just naturally happens,\" CEO Keyan Kazemian told Business Insider.\n\nAt a high level, 222 matches people with strangers for experiences like dinner or a night out after they take a robust personality quiz, using machine learning models trained by its team and open-source AI models.\n\n\"When you walk in, all of those people are people we predict you're going to be able to have a good conversation with, and you'll like,\" COO Danial Hashemi said.\n\nWhen 222 launched in 2021, it began as a dinner series in Los Angeles for young adults emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, helping them meet new people. Then the project grew into a company. It was accepted into Y Combinator, raised capital, moved to New York City, and launched a mobile app to spur in-real-life (IRL) socializing.\n\nWhile people who join 222 are often new to a city, Kazemian said, today they're pretty evenly split along why they're using the platform: they're either looking for new friends or potential romantic connections.\n\nSince putting out its app in 2024, the 222 experience has evolved. It's no longer just about meeting strangers, having a fun night, and forming new relationships.\n\n\"We're very focused on going beyond that,\" Kazemian said.\n\nThe platform is now digging deeper into connecting people after the first encounter that 222 initiates. It's helping plan follow-up hangs with friends and kindling a romantic connection by setting people up on a date if the feeling is mutual.\n\nAfter a 222 experience, the platform follows up to ask attendees whether they want to hang out or go on a date with anyone they met.\n\nOnce two people say they'd like to go on a date, \"we fully set up the next date for them,\" Hashemi said — reservation and all.\n\n\"If you think about just before dating apps, before all this stuff, how would people meet each other?\" Hashemi said. \"It would be you're in the same physical space with no preconceived notions of who this person is going to be.\"\n\nHashemi said that some of the \"joy\" of navigating how you feel about someone new in your life has \"gone away because of dating apps.\"\n\nMeeting in a way that feels more organic, such as a social gathering or through friends, has staying power. A 2025 survey of 7,000 US adults by health company Hims found that 77% of Gen Z met their partners IRL. Even Partiful, the Gen Z replacement for Facebook Events, is getting in on the IRL event-to-dating pipeline.\n\n222 thinks AI can make the meet-cute more accessible.\n\nWhat 222's founding team has zeroed in on is \"labeled data,\" Kazemian said, which comes from its users' feedback after they meet people.\n\nThe startup knows its first pairings may not be the ultimate match, which is why it encourages its subscribers — who pay $22 a month — to try multiple experiences. Its AI, in return, can curate better matches from 222's network.\n\nThere are layers of factors that contribute to that, 222's CTO Arman Roshannai said, such as similar music tastes or hometowns.\n\n\"The signal that we're training on is after you meet this person, you spend two hours getting dinner with them, and then you hang out for a few hours afterwards, were you guys actually a good match for each other?\" Roshannai added.\n\nKazemian added that training on this proprietary data from user feedback is a \"painstakingly difficult and long process,\" but gives the startup a \"technical moat\" to stand out from some competitors.\n\n222 isn't the only startup — or public company — betting that AI can improve how we connect.\n\nSeveral startups have launched with this premise and are raising millions, pitching matchmaking solutions that use AI to set people up. Meanwhile, Bumble, Tinder, and Facebook Dating are testing the AI waters and reimagining the swipe. Hinge's founder recently left the Match Group-owned dating app to build an AI dating alternative.\n\nAfter raising another $10.1 million from venture capital investors in 2025 — bringing the startup's total raised to $13.7 million — 222 is doubling down on hiring and expanding its product with tools that keep relationships going.\n\n222's next undertaking is to provide avenues for its users to reach their \"next offline moment\" together, so they can deepen those relationships.\n\nThe startup wants to be in the business of both creating relationships and maintaining them.\n\n\"They need to show up at the same place together,\" Kazemian said, be it a hangout, a date, or a restaurant reservation. \"We can help them figure out what that place is.\"",

    "description": "Branden James has spent the last 10 years flying to Puerto Vallarta for the winter with his husband. He says he is not afraid with what is happening.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Branden James, a 47-year-old musician who has spent the last 10 winters in Puerto Vallarta. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nYesterday morning, my husband and I were sitting in bed, looking out the windows, when we suddenly saw what looked like a fast-moving cloud across the sky. At first, I thought it was a rainstorm coming, but when I opened the window properly, I could see it was smoke — tons of it.\n\nWith the window open, we could hear explosions erupting into plumes of smoke across the beautiful, historic district of Puerto Vallarta.\n\nI was shocked. My husband and I have been to this city every year for 10 years during the winter months to perform as musicians. We've never experienced anything like this. This city has always felt safe.\n\nI opened Facebook to try and see if anyone in the local community groups knew what was going on. Everyone was piecing together that this must be retaliation after Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, Mexico's leader of the Jalisco New Generation drug cartel, was killed during a security operation to arrest him on Sunday.\n\nRealizing we didn't have much food in the apartment, we went to a friend's apartment on the eighth floor of our building to eat.\n\nWe all went to the rooftop of the building and could clearly see all kinds of activity unfolding below us. There were fires in shops. There were people being pulled from cars. We saw people going into buildings and throwing Molotov cocktails.\n\nIt was frightening to look outside and see so much burning in flames, but it was oddly comforting to see that civilians weren't being harmed.\n\nAs the smoke rose up to where we were standing on the rooftop, it started to feel unsafe to breathe in all the flames, which smelled of gas. As late afternoon rolled in, the smoke dissipated, and by evening, it had disappeared.\n\nAt around 5:30 p.m., a giant military chopper circled around us, which felt alarming for everyone looking on. The night was quiet, and we slept through the night without any disturbance.\n\nToday, we can see that people are starting to venture out to corner stores for food, but many shops are still shuttered. People here like to eat out daily, keeping only small amounts of food at home. I can see lines outside the open shops. We have eggs and smoothies, so we are trying to stay in for the most part.\n\nI can sense that people are rolling with how things are going. Flights have been canceled, but I've heard Airbnbs and hotels have been great about letting people stay longer.\n\nWhile I'm not fearful, I am sad. I'm sad for locals who survive on tourism. Americans have traditionally been scared about the safety of Mexico, and this justifies fears. But for so long, this has not been the case in Puerto Vallarta — it's always been incredibly safe. I'm sad about the impact that this disruption will have on locals' livelihoods and the impact on the reputation of the city I love so much.\n\nDespite these last two days, I still feel safer in Puerto Vallarta than I do in the United States, where I live for large parts of the year. In the US, there is so much more gun violence targeted at civilians.\n\nAs messed up as the drug cartel attack is, it is retaliation against the government, rather than against actual civilians here in the city. I haven't felt unsafe these last two days, because never once did I feel like the cartels were coming for us.\n\nWe are scheduled to be here until March 6th. We have three performances left — they may or may not get canceled. We'll most likely just stay here until our return date home, unless things get really dangerous.",

    "description": "Governance watchers say Susan Rice's critique of Donald Trump is complicating Netflix's bid for Warner Bros., while others call her stance principled.",
    "fullText": "A corporate board seat can bring status and stock awards — and also political heat.\n\nThe criticism that Netflix board member Susan Rice leveled at President Donald Trump last week is dividing governance watchers over how political a corporate director can afford to be.\n\nRice, who served in top roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, made several critical remarks about the commander in chief during an appearance on the podcast \"Stay Tuned with Preet Bharara.\" Trump responded by demanding that Netflix remove her from her seat \"or pay the consequences.\"\n\nThe spat has come at a precarious time for the video-streaming company. Netflix's pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery— an $82.7 billion bid — could reshape Hollywood, but it requires approval from the Department of Justice's antitrust division.\n\nWhile Rice's actions didn't break any laws, governance experts who spoke with Business Insider were split over whether she crossed a line.\n\nDirectors would be wise to keep their personal views about politics and other sensitive topics out of the public eye, said Charles Elson, founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. Their fiduciary responsibility is to serve in the company's best interests, and Rice's remarks ran counter to that duty, he said.\n\n\"It's poor judgment. And you're elected as a director for your judgment,\" Elson said. \"She has to ask herself, 'Am I a public figure or am I a corporate director?'\"\n\nElson, himself a director, said he avoids publicly staking out political positions. \"I just don't think it's in my lane,\" he said.\n\nTrump's threat of retaliation, however, didn't align with the kind of conduct normally expected of a sitting president, either, said Jo-Ellen Pozner, a management and entrepreneurship professor at Santa Clara University's Leavey School of Business.\n\n\"It's really important to recognize that what Susan Rice was calling out is exactly the behavior that Trump responded with,\" she said. \"Trump's reaction just points out how important what she has to say is.\"\n\nRice spoke critically of Trump at length on the podcast, suggesting her remarks were intentional rather than off the cuff.\n\n\"This might have felt like the hill that she was ready to die on, metaphorically,\" added Pozner. \"It's definitely risky for her politically. It's definitely risky for the Netflix deal, but it also seems like such a principled stance that it ought to be respected by most people.\"\n\nRice, Netflix, and the White House didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIt is possible that Rice warned Netflix's leadership about the podcast and got its blessing behind the scenes. Ted Sarandos, the company's co-CEO, referred to its bid for Warner Bros. as a \"business deal\" on the BBC's Today program on Monday. \"It's not a political deal,\" he said.\n\nStill, Rice's public and partisan tongue-lashing is unusual for a director on a major corporate board. It could make companies reconsider whether to put political figures on their boards, Elson said.\n\n\"Obviously, someone coming out of public service has a lot of experience, a lot of intelligence,\" said Elson. But, he added, \"Are you retired or not?\"\n\nThe incident could further discourage corporate leaders from speaking their minds in public, said Pozner. The president has repeatedly targeted critics, publicly calling for boycotts of companies and attacking business figures who challenge him.\n\n\"I think it will have a dampening effect on public speech,\" said Pozner.\n\nGovernance experts say the incident should serve as a case study for corporate boardrooms.\n\n\"Every company in America that has a pending regulatory approval should be watching the case,\" said Bradley Akubuiro, a partner at leadership advisory firm Bully Pulpit International.\n\n\"The lesson isn't: Don't have political opinions. The lesson is: Understand when your company is at peak vulnerability and govern that accordingly. … Time really does matter.\"\n\nCompanies may be able to prevent directors from causing a similar kerfuffle, said Akubuiro, by enacting quiet periods during sensitive moments. These would be similar to how leaders are expected to clam up in the weeks leading up to companies' quarterly earnings reports.\n\n\"You just want to recognize that in a politicized moment, anything that's quasi-political can become a weapon, and folks will use that against you for maximum leverage,\" Akubuiro said.\n\nSimilarly, companies need defined communication policies that set expectations for directors, especially when regulatory stakes are high, and outline what to do if a board member goes off script, said Jennifer Schielke, CEO of the staffing firm Summit Group Solutions.\n\n\"The boardroom should be designed for robust dissent that is productive and private,\" she said.\n\nIn a fractious political environment, it's prudent for board members to get counsel and to consider the potential costs and benefits of what they say, said Jill E. Fisch, a professor of business law at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nYet, she added, \"That is completely different from being cowed into not saying anything.\"\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, is a Netflix board member.",

    "description": "A 75-year-old New Jersey man flew to Puerto Vallarta to avoid a blizzard, only to get stranded amid cartel violence. Now he's trying to get back home.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Brian Thompson, 75, who lives in New Jersey. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nOn February 21, my wife and I traveled to Puerto Vallarta, just in time to miss a historic blizzard hitting the Jersey Shore.\n\nWhen we were planning this trip, it seemed like a good idea to miss a couple of winter weeks by traveling to Puerto Vallarta, where I'd visited twice before.\n\nPeople describe Puerto Vallarta as a little bit of paradise. Locals and tourists here are very friendly. It's a vibrant, bustling city with a great jazz scene.\n\nI'd never felt unsafe here until yesterday. I woke up in the morning and saw what I thought was pollution from automobile exhaust, but when I went down to the front door of the condominium, people said we were under attack by the cartel.\n\nAt first, we stayed in our unit because we were told to shelter in place. I went up to the condominium's front door to see what was going on, but I didn't go any further. I spent the next few hours communicating with family and friends who wanted to know if we were OK.\n\nLater on, I went out onto the pool deck and could see new fires and smoke, and a helicopter circling. I saw multiple videos online of vehicles being burned in the area.\n\nThe scariest part was hearing that the restaurant adjoining our building was on fire. Fortunately, it was quickly put out, but I could see smoke coming across our balcony.\n\nThis morning, it looks like things have calmed down. My wife struggled to fall asleep last night. I've been worried about her, but I've only felt a little bit scared. For the most part, my adrenaline was high. I've spent my career as a television journalist, and I'm used to running toward trouble. I decided to report on the events to my audience by sending information to my friends and people on X.\n\nWe spent last night with some other residents in the condo, and they shared their food with us.\n\nWhen my wife and I arrived on Saturday, we didn't have much food with us. I'd brought three protein bars with me, and we'd gotten a few items from a local store, including chips, guacamole, and yogurt. I haven't tried to leave the condo yet today. Whether I will or not depends partly on whether my wife will let me.\n\nWe planned to travel to Mexico City after spending a week in Puerto Vallarta, but we've canceled that leg of our trip.\n\nSo far, it's been hard to get flights out of the area. The earliest trips I've been able to find are on this Friday and Saturday, and I've booked trips back to the US through both Houston and Los Angeles.\n\nI'm hoping New Jersey will have dug itself out from the blizzard by Friday, but I haven't booked our travel from Houston to New Jersey because I don't even know if we'll make it to Houston.\n\nI don't know if we'll come back to Puerto Vallarta, but I hope we will. I want to come back to support the people of Puerto Vallarta and show faith in their country.\n\nDo you have a story to share about being stuck on holiday in Mexico?

    "fullText": "The AI-driven software sell-off that ravaged markets in early February isn't over, with IBM stock tanking on Monday as Anthropic unveiled another disruptive AI tool.\n\nIBM shares fell 13% after the maker of the Claude AI chatbot announced another new tool. In this case, the startup announced an update that can help reduce the cost of COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) systems used by many businesses.\n\nThe term may not be widely known outside the software industry, but it quickly sent IBM stock into a nosedive in the latest installment of the software sell-off.\n\nAnthropic announced the update in a blog post, laying out why COBOL matters and why people outside the tech community should care.\n\n\"COBOL is everywhere. It handles an estimated 95% of ATM transactions in the US,\" it wrote. \"Hundreds of billions of lines of COBOL run in production every day, powering critical systems in finance, airlines, and government. Despite that, the number of people who understand it shrinks every year.\"\n\nAmong its uses, the company said the new tool could \"Identify risks that would take human analysts months to surface.\" The new AI use case poses a potential threat to the kind of business data service that comprises a core part of IBM's business.\n\nAccording to the startup, Claude will allow companies to streamline their COBOL operations for a fraction of their previous cost, similar to the legal plugins the company rolled out early in the month that triggered the initial software sell-off.\n\n\"Legacy code modernization stalled for years because understanding legacy code cost more than rewriting it. AI flips that equation,\" Anthropic said in its post.\n\nTech stocks initially bounced back after Anthropic's legal plugin release spooked Wall Street and caused investors to rush to limit their legal tech exposure, but the market was selling off sharply again on Monday.\n\nEven before the Anthropic news hit IBM shares, the sector was tumbling earlier in the session as investors reacted to tariff uncertainty and a report making the rounds online that speculated about far-reaching negative impacts of AI.",

    "description": "After cartel violence shut down flights and blocked roads in Puerto Vallarta, Americans are canceling vacations and rethinking future travel plans.",
    "fullText": "Hannah Donovan is four months pregnant. And with two little ones already at home, she and her husband had been banking on one family trip before life got even more hectic.\n\nPuerto Vallarta was meant to be a babymoon — a chance to meet up with family nearby, soak up the sun, and actually relax for a few days.\n\nHowever, less than 24 hours before they were set to head to their airport in Idaho, videos and pictures of burning cars and billowing smoke began circulating on social media.\n\nDonovan said the images she saw online followed reports that Mexican forces carried out an operation on Sunday in Tapalpa, Jalisco, that killed Nemesio \"El Mencho\" Oseguera Cervantes, the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. The incident sparked retaliatory violence across multiple cities in Mexico, including in Puerto Vallarta.\n\nThe Donovans have since canceled their trip to Mexico and will play it by ear on whether they'll try to visit Puerto Vallarta later.\n\n\"We're incredibly grateful we're not there, but we're worried about the people who are, including travelers and our family who live there,\" Donovan, 28, told Business Insider. \"We're definitely a little traumatized by the situation.\"\n\nThe Donovans are among many Americans rethinking trips, moves, and stays in the region after chaos flared across parts of Mexico following the killing of Oseguera Cervantes on Sunday. Four people at the scene were killed, according to authorities. Three others — including Oseguera Cervantes — were wounded and later died, and two people were arrested. Three members of the armed forces were also wounded.\n\nIt comes after President Donald Trump designated the cartel a foreign terrorist organization. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the US provided intelligence support for the operation, but stopped short of offering details on how. The administration has prioritized cracking down on Latin American cartels, urging leaders to take a harder line and deploying military force against suspected drug-smuggling vessels in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean.\n\nIn the hours since, the US and Canadian governments have urged citizens in some areas to shelter in place, and said most domestic and international flights in Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta were grounded. On Monday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum called for calm in the country, but many of those flights remained canceled.\n\nMexico has become increasingly popular with American tourists, drawn by its vibrant nightlife, strong culinary scene, and affordability compared to other trendy international destinations such as France and Japan.\n\n\"Americans, especially on the West Coast, have long used it as an inexpensive place to go on vacation,\" Robin Ingle, a specialist in travel security, told Business Insider.\n\nMexico has also seen a surge in tourism from people who previously would have traveled to the US but are avoiding the country for various political or financial reasons, he said.\n\n\"A lot of the people I've spoken to over the weekend would have gone to places like Florida, California, Arizona — now they're going to Mexico instead,\" he said of the tourists he's spoken to since cartel violence broke out.\n\nBut as unrest spreads, some Americans who had planned to vacation or relocate there, or who are already in Mexico, are watching those plans unravel.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with three of them about what comes next.\n\nDoug Howell, a retired sales and distribution executive from the Spokane, Washington area, bought a rental place in Puerto Vallarta and now spends roughly six months a year there — a routine he's kept up for the past 20 years.\n\n\"It's very vibrant,\" Howell, 63, told Business Insider. \"I like to walk around the neighborhoods, everything is pretty close, or a short bus ride away if you want to check out the beaches or the waterfalls. There's always something to do, and the food is incredible.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Howell said he was standing on his balcony when he started hearing explosions, then saw plumes of smoke rising nearby. Before long, he said, he noticed highways and roads in and out of the area had been blocked off.\n\nHe was scared at first, he said, and hunkered down with neighbors.\"We just stayed inside all day yesterday, and I didn't go anywhere,\" he recalled. \"They actually bombed a store on a corner and a car on the bridge that's not even a quarter of a mile away.\"\n\n\"They're already on it today, and people are supporting each other in the community — that's what I like about it,\" he said. \"One question everybody asks me: Is it safe? And it's like, yeah, it is, unless you go to the wrong place at the wrong time. And that's anywhere in the world.\"\n\nFor now, Howell plans to stay in Mexico, but if things worsen, he said he plans to return to the States.\n\nLinda Armijo and her husband have been visiting Puerto Vallarta for the past 25 years.\n\nIn January, they returned for a three-month stay in the city's Marina Vallarta district, an upscale, waterfront area in northern Puerto Vallarta.\n\nArmijo said that on Sunday, after her husband's massage therapist warned that roads downtown were blocked, she went up to the rooftop terrace of their condo, which overlooks the city. From there, she said she could see five or six plumes of smoke.\n\nSmoke isn't entirely unusual in Puerto Vallarta — controlled burns are common — but Armijo said this was more than she typically sees. \"I came down to our condo and told Anthony, 'There's something going on, there are fires everywhere,'\" she recalled.\n\nArmijo said the city was hit by a series of disruptions, including the blast of an engine as a car was set on fire, interruptions to water service, and highways and roads blocked off. Although the uncertainty has left tourists and locals scrambling, they're relying on each other to get by.\n\n\"I met two girls from LA who are renting a condo upstairs. They were meant to fly out yesterday, and threw away all their food and supplies before learning their flight was canceled. I shared some water with them,\" Armijo said. She added that a building worker told her they were also accommodating those who needed to extend their stay.\n\nArmijo plans to stay put for now and said she isn't especially worried about her safety. Instead, she's thinking about what this could mean for the city.\n\n\"I feel safe in my building, and we have plenty of food and water,\" the Spanish-speaker said. \"It's a minor inconvenience not being able to leave, but my biggest emotions are sadness and concern for the people of Puerto Vallarta.\"\n\nIn the near term, Ingle, the travel security specialist, said he expects to see an impact on the tourism scene.\n\n\"I know there's going to be a blowback in the next month, people deciding not to go, because there's a percentage of the population that doesn't want to take risks,\" he said. \"Governments are putting out warnings, and that affects travel insurance.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the long-term impact, however, Ingle doesn't see this weekend's violence creating a lasting stain on Puerto Vallarta's ability to attract tourists.\n\n\"If all the violence dies down quickly and gets cleaned up, I think this will go away,\" Ingle said. \"Normally, this will take a couple days, and then it will fix itself.\"\n\n\"That doesn't mean it's without risk,\" he added.",

    "description": "The Air Force has been looking into what's possible with autonomous drones and how they can fight alongside advanced crewed aircraft.",
    "fullText": "A crewed US Air Force fighter and an uncrewed jet-powered aircraft flew together recently, communicating and showing how autonomous drones might fight in a future air war alongside human pilots.\n\nUS defense firm General Atomics, a competitor in the Air Force's Collaborative Combat Program aimed at developing and fielding loyal wingman-type drones, said on Monday that its MQ-20 Avenger, long a CCA stand-in, flew with an F-22 Raptor.\n\nDuring the test at Edwards Air Force Base earlier this month, the stealth fighter's pilot commanded the test drone to carry out tactical maneuvers, perform combat air patrols, and execute airborne threat engagement tasks.\n\nThe most recent demonstration is an advancement of a similar test in November 2025, when an F-22 pilot used a tablet to control an MQ-20, a test aircraft being used to demonstrate CCA-style teaming. The tablet allowed the pilot to communicate with the drone and send commands during flight.\n\nThe flight test earlier this month saw the Raptor pilot use government-provided autonomy software on the F-22 and a tactical data link to pass commands in real time to the drone.\n\n\"This demo featured the integration of mission elements and the ability of autonomy to utilize onboard sensors to make independent decisions and execute commands from the F-22,\" David Alexander, the president of General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc., said in a statement.\n\nGeneral Atomics said the latest demonstration showed how CCA-type platforms could increase the combat power available to human pilots in a future war.\n\nThe Collaborative Combat Aircraft program is a priority for the Air Force as a way to bolster American airpower. These drones are meant to fly alongside advanced fighters, including the coming sixth-generation F-47 being developed by Boeing.\n\nAir Force officials say CCAs aren't disposable, but they're cheaper than fighters like the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter. They are built to be attritable so they can be risked in combat instead of a human-piloted aircraft.\n\nTesting with the MQ-20 is helping inform the Air Force's CCA program, which is focused on General Atomics' YFQ-42, Anduril's YFQ-44, and Northrop Grumman's YFQ-48A. The air service envisions these systems as easily upgradable platforms compatible with high-end crewed aircraft.\n\nCCA-type drones, which include designs beyond those with dedicated Air Force program designations, are designed to carry out missions on their own, from air-to-air combat to strike and intelligence roles, while also boosting the power of a formation by adding more sensors and weapons without another pilot in the cockpit.\n\nThe Air Force says that CCAs are not intended as replacements for its crewed jets but are rather partners that will change how pilots work with artificial intelligence and drones — and expand US airpower in a fight, especially against a near-peer adversary.",

    "description": "Lou Cohen emphasizes AI's potential in marketing, urging marketers to leverage it for improved audience segmentation and ad efficiency.",
    "fullText": "Lou Cohen, EY's chief digital officer, said many marketers are not yet taking advantage of the benefits of artificial intelligence.\n\nCohen, who is also a professor at New York University, Yeshiva University, and Baruch College, said marketing is at an \"inflection point,\" with investment shifting from general digital innovation to AI transformation.\n\nCohen said that marketers who understand how to use AI in an assistive way, by focusing on what outcomes it delivers best, will access a deeper level of audience segmenting, targeting, and testing. He was interviewed for CMO Insider at Business Insider's studio in New York City.\n\nUltimately, Cohen said, the marketing function will embrace the new opportunity. \"Marketers, they're not afraid to try things,\" Cohen said. \"We're going to learn more from the things that we fail with and that don't work than the things that do.\"\n\nThe following transcript has been edited for clarity.\n\nWe are at an interesting inflection point. In today's marketing environment, you really need to understand how to make AI work for you; otherwise, you will end up working for it.\n\nThere are efficiency and operational gains to be had. But if you think about the outcomes that AI can enable from a marketing perspective, we could be smarter about how we segment our audiences for different campaigns. We could be more efficient in the ways our advertising runs. We could test more rapidly to get better-quality content in front of the right audiences at the right time in the right place.\n\nBut most marketing teams are not yet set up to take advantage of this potential. So the investments of the last 15 years in digital transformation are now shifting into AI transformation.\n\nIt's a bit unknown now. Marketers are not totally comfortable with this because we're so worried that it's going to hallucinate or give us something that isn't accurate. Marketers, they're not afraid to try things. We're going to learn more from the things that we fail with and that don't work than from the things that do.\n\nMy colleague came up with a great way to evaluate the quality of our content using AI. We can paste in an article that a partner of ours wrote, and it will give us recommendations on how to make that piece of content better. But we're never — I shouldn't say never — we're not likely to use content created by AI. But we certainly can use AI to enhance and give feedback to our content creators.\n\nHallucinations are real. The challenge is that as consumers of these technologies, we don't yet understand the difference between probabilistic and deterministic outcomes. Probabilistic is the likely correct response that the AI is trying to give us. Deterministic is \"one plus one equals two,\" and arguably, one plus one always equals two. \n\nWhen you're doing a search on Google or Bing, for example, you are getting a deterministic response. You're getting what it believes to be the likely to answer your question. Versus with the LLMs, the ChatGPTs, the Llamas, the Geminis of the world, you're getting a probabilistic response. The model is bringing a bunch of different sources together to determine the answer it thinks you should get based on your prompt.\n\nThat means if we were using these tools for their designed purpose, we'd still need search engines to just navigate to the things we're looking for, or to find the needles in the haystack of the internet. But LLMs give us a different opportunity. They can be assistants. That was some of the original idea behind these AI tools, to assist people in doing different tasks.\n\nI think of these LLMs more as marketing assistants to give me real-time ideas, feedback, or suggestions, rather than doing the task for me. That's a human putting AI to work to get better outcomes faster than if I were to just do it myself.",

    "fullText": "I'll admit, I'm one of the reasons the airport security line is moving so slowly. Once I reach the TSA agent, even if I've rehearsed the interaction for last 30 minutes, I always end up rummaging furiously through my travel tote, where my plane reads, passport, and random lip balms have all mixed.\n\nFinally, I switched over to a designated travel purse. I've found it to be much more useful than a travel backpack because I can wear it throughout my whole trip, rather than just at the airport. The best travel purses I tested have better storage options for a passport, phone, keys, and wallet, offering convenient access in a cute, wearable little package.\n\nFor more on the best personal items we love to travel with, see our guide to the best weekender bags and best carry-on luggage.\n\nTo find the stylish travel purses for staying organized, I tested 10 bags and wore each for at least 5 hours. I wore them in crowded urban areas, on road trips, and through hiking trails. I took note of how heavy they felt and how long it took me to grab things when I needed them, particularly at cash registers and while going through customs. Our team of editors have tested dozens of other crossbody bags on international flights and backcountry road trips, the best of which we added below.\n\nThe genius zippered vertical side pocket keeps everything organized. I wore this medium-sized crossbody bag for errand-filled city excursions, beach days, and a weekend cabin getaway. No other purse I tested felt so well-suited to such a range of environments.\n\nThe interior pockets are helpfully mesh-lined so I could see where everything was the moment I opened the bag. It's hard for me to choose a favorite pocket — there are so many smart ones, including the built-in card holder. \"My favorite part is its vertical zippered side pocket, where I can pull out my phone without taking the bag off my shoulder,\" writes senior associate style editor Gabrielle Chase.\n\nIt's lightweight, buttery soft, and comfy to carry all day. In addition to looking high-end, the leather feels silky-smooth and gentle on my skin. Even when I had the bag stuffed to maximum capacity, the wide adjustable strap lands really comfortably and evenly, never digging into my shoulder or back. It only weighs 10.8 ounces, which is impressive given the amount of storage options.\n\nIt can convert into three different bags. The adjustable, removable strap clicks into the body of the bag, allowing you to wear the Aoyama as a shoulder bag or even a clutch. Having one beautiful, adaptable bag that keeps me organized from the airport to a fancy dinner saves space in my suitcase. This kind of versatility makes the $248 price tag a bit more justifiable. There's also a nylon version that costs $178.\n\nRead \n\nIt's low-maintenance and machine-washable. Made of a durable-feeling recycled nylon, the fabric isn't what you might call \"luxury\"—rather, it's sporty and lightweight, which is far more important to me when I'm lugging suitcases and spilling coffee. Best of all for a messy, outdoorsy traveler like myself is that this Baggu is machine-washable.\n\nThe storage is simple and roomy. The Cargo Crossbody doesn't have as many specialized compartments as the other options I tested. Instead, there's just two exterior pockets and one interior zippered pocket. But the fact that the roomy interior is open gives me the option for all the other stuff I inevitably acquire while traveling. It can comfortably fit a wallet, sandwich, can of Diet Coke, a Nintendo switch, phone and a book, as I learned from my picnic in the park.\n\nIt comes in a variety of cute colors. Mine is a French blue, which adds a fun pop of color to any outfit (just because a bag is utilitarian and practical doesn't mean it has to be plain).\n\nI no longer have to root around in my bag for my phone. Before Bandolier, I'd yet to find an accessory that offers easy, fumble-free, repeated access to my phone, which I use constantly while traveling — checking reservations, looking at Google Maps, or filming my pasta like I'm an influencer.\n\nBandolier's sturdy leather phone case, which has a handy envelope for cards, upgraded my entire life. I can wearing my phone elegantly as a purse, with the crossbody strap clasped directly to the leather phone case. This made it so easy to grab and then \"put away,\" i.e. drop so it simply drapes across my body. The case clasps easily into Bandolier's expanded pouch, which can fit tickets, a thin wallet, a passport, keys, and a lip balm.\n\nThe materials and design feel expensive. Also, it is expensive. Both made of 100% leather, the Expanded Pouch is $98, and the Lily Duet (which is crossbody and wristlet phone case duo) costs $148. The sturdy pouch is a nice addition for a bit of extra storage, but you don't necessarily need to buy both: the phone case and detachable strap are enough.\n\nThe phone case itself is amazing. The back pocket card holder has a snap closure that keeps my credit card and ID secure and hidden. It's much safer than the exposed card holders I had before. I've made this my permanent phone case, whether traveling or not.\n\nThere are so many security features. The locking clasp straps are secure — they even take me a moment to undo when I'm just alone in my house, so I can't imagine how a thief would pull it off. I wore this bag through Times Square to get to a gynecologist appointment, and not for a second did I fear for the precious contents inside it (which included my anti-anxiety meds). Arden Cove makes it with \"slash-resistant lining\" and a hidden back zip pocket where I put my passport.\n\nIt can be worn in four ways. This Bum Bag's adjustable straps let me wear it as a belt bag, fanny pack, chest bag, or crossbody, which is ideal for crowded, high-traffic areas when I want my belongings as close to me as possible. The structure of the bag itself is less flexible than other options, but it allows you to keep everything close to the chest.\n\nThe storage is elite. I'm obsessed with its storage options, which includes two card holders that are perfect for subway cards, business cards, credit cards, IDs, and small tickets.\n\nIt's really comfortable. Away's simple design offers just the right amount of structure and slouch. It's made from a water-repellant polyester till feels cushiony and almost quilted. Even when I filled the bag with snacks, a big book, a Fuji camera, and my notebook, the padding around the strap prevented the bag from digging into my shoulders.\n\nIt has an impressive capacity. The Featherlight Crossbody weighs just over half a pound, yet has a storage capacity of 10 liters. I wore the bag on a bike trail along the Hudson River, to a Phillies game, and to Brighton Beach, where water and sand slid right off. It's also machine washable.\n\nThere are super useful hidden exterior pockets. I used the tiny one on the strap, which is perfect for AirPods or keys, and the other that's ideally sized for a passport and phone. These helped me avoid rummaging around in my bag in front of hotel receptionists and baristas.\n\nThere are so many ways to store things. I especially loved the convenience of the exterior magnetic-closure phone pocket. It has special compartments like card slots and pen loops, with loads of interior and exterior pockets for easy access to everyday items. I found myself constantly using the little loops for pens — a Godsend as mine are always scribbling on the bottom of my bags.\n\nIt looks cool. The Micah crossbody has a really distinctive, athletic look, with fun, chunky zippers. I felt really cool wearing it to yoga class and to the dog park. The 100% vegan material is made from 7 recycled plastic bottles, and it feels durable and sturdy.\n\nIt's lightweight and comfortable. It's can easily fit all the items I want while traveling — like documents, tablets, pens, books, and large headphones — but not something as large as a water bottle (for that, we suggest Dagne Dover's Sloan Sling instead).\n\nIt has a slim profile with a deceptively spacious main compartment. \"I toted it for a long day in New York City, and I appreciated that all my items were secured, but I knew exactly where to find them when I needed to,\" writes style contributor Talia Ergas.\n\nThere are eight pockets total, \"with organizational features galore designed with neat freaks like me in mind,\" says Talia. \"On the exterior, it has a front U-shaped pocket that offers a perfect compartment for stowing my cash and credit cards (in the leather card pocket), keys (via an easy access key leash), a pen (which stays secure thanks to a leather pen loop), and other quick-access items like a passport or tickets.\"\n\nIts lightweight design packs flat. Say you're wearing a backpack on the plane, but still want your Tumi Tyler Crossbody once you reach your destination. You can simply empty out the contents and the water resistant nylon exterior won't crumple, even if you have to smoosh it beneath the rest of your belongings.\n\nIt makes a trendy handbag into a practical purse. East-West bags — the long, skinny silhouette popularized by Alaia's $2,950 Le Teckel — can be horribly impractical. The slim body might be the trendiest shape right now, but I can't imagine squeezing travel essentials like sunscreen or snacks into a purse built like a pencil case. But the Gabrielle Shoulder Bag from Parisa Wang makes this purse trend practical. Not only is it supremely roomy, but it also has lots of functional features like quick-access pockets and handles that feel comfortable enough on your shoulder for all-day wear.\n\nThe elongated shape makes the purse incredibly spacious. I fit a hard-shell sunglass case, a 3.4-ounce bottle of sunscreen, a granola bar, a wallet, a pack of Band-Aids, two lipsticks, a claw clip, and all my little essentials like keys and AirPods in the purse with lots of room to spare. It also has two exterior pockets on either side of the bag, which are perfect for storing quick-access items like tickets or travel documents.\n\nIt works from day trips to dinner reservations. Lots of practical purses tend to lean too heavily into function at the cost of form. But this bag, with its smooth leather and minimalist look, would be chic enough for a stop at a Parisian wine bar after your walking tour. We all know the look of a tourist with their many-pocketed fanny pack, but this purse won't make you look like you came straight from a survivalist retreat. — Samantha Crozier, style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nMaria Yagoda, travel writer and style contributor: Maria is based in Brooklyn, where she covers travel and culture. It's where these two fields intersect that she's witnessed the latest style trends from across the globe. Whether she's flying to Italy or venturing upstate, Maria is intuiting which travel accessories are a worthy investment for most people in terms of convenience, comfort, and aesthetics.\n\nLearn how the Reviews team tests clothing, shoes, and accessories at Business Insider.\n\nStorage capacity: You want a travel purse that's small enough to not add bulk, but still has room inside for an umbrella, book, or souvenirs you pick up along the way. I found the ideal liter capacity for travel purses to be around 10 liters.\n\nSecurity features: Look for RFID-blocking compartments to protect your credit cards, and zippered closures. Crossbody bags offer a more secure fit that's harder to swipe off your person.\n\nWeight and adaptability: The more lightweight a travel purse is — and the more ways you can adjust its wide strap to distribute the weight — the more comfortable you'll be throughout your trip. Look for travel purses that weigh between 8 to 10 ounces.\n\nDurability: Look for machine washable, water-resistant materials (like nylon) especially if you'll be doing outdoorsy stuff.\n\nCompartments: Look for travel purses with horizontal and vertical zippered pockets on its interior, exterior, or even carrying strap.\n\nKAAI Rebel Crossbody ($575) This sporty, luxury-grade sling bag has a cool asymmetrical shape and is lined with a beautiful blue suede. Unfortunately it was too narrow and structured to fit anything bulky.\n\nQuince Italian Leather Convertible Crescent Shoulder Bag ($119) This is a well-made Italian leather purse that looks a lot like the very trendy Clare V. Moyen Messenger ($435). It's comfortable to wear, but the internal organization is somewhat minimal.\n\nCuyana Mini Paloma Bag ($398) It's elegant, compact, and has good organizational features, but was just a bit too small for my everyday carry. This one's better suited to minimalist travelers.\n\nCaraa Nimbus ($190) Design-wise, this bag has a very distinctive, cool look. It's kind of fluffy and cloud-like, so it could be used as a travel pillow if you're desperate. The storage space is really flexible and can accommodate quite a lot, but it only has three interior pockets.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

    "fullText": "The roar of Lamborghini's screaming V10 and V12 engines won't go silent.\n\nIn an interview with The Sunday Times, CEO Stephan Winkelmann said the Italian supercar maker has scrapped plans for its first all-electric model, the Lanzador, after consumer interest in high-priced EVs flattened to \"close to zero.\"\n\n\"EVs, in their current form, struggle to deliver this specific emotional connection,\" he told the Times, adding that engine noise is often a selling point for luxury sports cars. \"The decision was made after over a year of continuous internal discussion, engaging with customers, dealers, market analysis, and global data.\"\n\nLamborghini first announced the Lanzador EV in 2023, and the high-riding two-door coupe was scheduled to hit dealerships by 2029.\n\nWinkelmann said the car will now come to market as a plug-in hybrid instead.\n\nThe shift marks a notable recalibration for the Volkswagen-owned supercar brand. In 2021, Lamborghini laid out an electrification road map that was supposed to add a fully-electric car by the \"second half of the decade.\" The company said it wanted to cut its 2024 carbon emissions in half.\n\nWinkelmann told the Times that by 2030, its entire lineup will feature a gas engine and a battery that can be plugged into an electrical outlet.\n\nHe added that it will continue building internal combustion engines \"for as long as possible.\"\n\n\"Lamborghini is fully prepared for full electric,\" the company said in a statement to Business Insider. \"However, market readiness within the segment is not yet aligned with this transition.\"",

    "title": "AI-Generated Playlists, a New Look, and Other Changes Coming to Apple Music",
    "description": "The next big iPhone update will bring new features to the Apple Music app.",
    "fullText": "Your iPhone is likely currently running iOS 26.3 (assuming you've been keeping up with the operating system updates), but there's another version currently in the works over at Apple HQ. Right now, beta testers have their hands on iOS 26.4, which is shaping up to be a much bigger update than the last. Among the changes, Apple is debuting end-to-end encryption for RCS chats, so texts with Android users will no longer be insecure, and the Reminders app is getting an \"Urgent\" section for any entries you've labeled as such.\n\nBut perhaps no part of iOS is getting a larger update with 26.4 than Apple Music—both the app, and Apple's paid subscription service. Apple seems to have decided that Music needed a bit of a facelift, as well as some quality of life changes that will make the app and service easier to use. Whether you use Apple Music for streaming or you rely on it to store your digital library, you're going to notice the updates when iOS 26.4 drops in the near future. Some of these features will be free and some only available to paid subscribers; I've reached out to Apple to confirm which is which, and I will update this piece if I hear back.\n\nDo you like making playlists, or do you know someone who does? The robots are coming for your hobby, too. With iOS 26.4, Apple Music is rolling out \"Playlist Playground,\" a new feature that lets you generate playlists from natural language prompts. In layman's terms, that means you tell the AI what kind of music you want to hear, and it will generate a playlist from that request. That could something hyper-specific, like \"Taylor Swift country tracks,\" or something more general, like \"morning coffee vibes.\" The AI will choose 25 songs it thinks match your query. If it doesn't get it quite right, you can ask it to make changes, and you can change things yourself, like the playlist's title, description, and cover image.\n\nI'm interested to try this out, if for no other reason than music discovery: I like Apple Music's curated playlists already, but I am intrigued as to whether asking Apple's AI to select certain types of songs for me will help me find new music any better than the platform's human curators. I also don't think this will stop me from making my own playlists, or looking for playlists from friends. Sure, maybe the AI is good at picking 25 songs that match a specific theme, but there is an art to hand-picking tracks that work well together—plus, it's just fun.\n\nApple is far from the first company to roll out such a feature. YouTube Music recently launched something similar, while Spotify has two different AI playlist features (AI Playlist and Prompted Playlist) available on its platform.\n\nWhen you start exploring Apple Music after updating to iOS 26.4, you'll likely notice something right away: The UX, which is normally white or black (whether your iPhone is in light or dark mode) now matches the color scheme of the artwork for the album or playlist you're checking out. The effect is especially cool when the album art supports full-screen motion, like the following:\n\nApple has made some divisive design decisions in recent years, but I think this change is going to be a crowd pleaser. The difference between the current design on iOS 26.3 and the new look is stark, and, while there's nothing wrong with how things stand now, it already looks super dated next to the full-screen color matching designs.\n\nSpeaking of playlists, you can now add songs to multiple at once—just in case you still need some human intervention when it comes to these playlists. When you go to add a song to a playlist, you'll notice a new button in the bottom right. Tap it, and Apple Music opens up the ability to select multiple playlists at once, and send the song to all of them. It's a small change, but a helpful one, especially if you frequently add new music to more than one playlist at a time. I could see myself using this to add a song to my personal new discoveries playlist, as well as a shared playlist of new music I keep with friends.\n\nNot all music is made to active listening. If you use Apple Music for background music, especially when sleeping, working, or zoning out, you might be interested in the new \"Ambient Music\" widget, which lets you launch one of four different ambient playlists from the Home Screen: Sleep, which plays \"Sleep Sounds;\" Chill, which plays \"Today's Chill;\" Productivity, which plays \"Productivity;\" or Wellbeing, which plays \"Pure Meditation.\"\n\nI still can't quite shake the habit of relying on YouTube for my \"focus music\" needs, especially since these tracks mess with my Apple Music algorithms. But it might make sense to start relying on the platform I actually pay for when I want music to work or fall asleep to—unless that music is only available elsewhere.\n\nApple Music is also making it easier to listen to music outside of the app. The platform is rolling out a \"Concerts Near You\" section, which shows you artists playing in your area. You can see popular artists and their concert dates, as well as shows that are coming up this week. You can sort by both date and genre, and you can update the location when you want to know where shows are going to be in different areas.",

    "title": "Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2026: How to Watch and What to Expect",
    "description": "The next Galaxy S Series is nearly here.",
    "fullText": "Whether you're a Samsung fan, an Android user, or just a tech enthusiast in general, you may want to clear your calendar: Samsung Unpacked 2026 is nearly here. Like Google I/O or Apple's fall event, Unpacked is Samsung's keynote, where the company shows off what it's been working on since, well, the last Unpacked. Like previous keynotes, this year's should be full of big Samsung news, all of which you can watch live as it happens.\n\nSamsung's big presentation will kick off in San Francisco on Wednesday, Feb. 25. Like many tech events, Galaxy Unpacked starts at 10 a.m. PT (1 p.m. ET).\n\nWhile Samsung is hosting a live presentation for a limited number of media and guests, anybody can tune into Galaxy Unpacked 2026 as it happens. The company is streaming the show from a number of websites, including Samsung.com, Samsung Newsroom, and Samsung's official YouTube channel. The YouTube livestream is currently up, but, of course, you won't see much until 1 p.m. ET on Wednesday.\n\nUsually, all we have is rumors and conjecture when reporting on what a company like Samsung will reveal during a big hardware event. We still need to do that in this case, but, that said, the company outright told us what its biggest announcement will be. When Samsung first announced Unpacked 2026 a couple weeks ago, it said that \"the new Galaxy S series is coming,\" which, no doubt, refers to the Galaxy S26. Samsung says this new series is \"built to simplify everyday interactions, inspire confidence, and make Galaxy AI feel seamlessly integrated from the moment it's in hand.\" Whatever that means.\n\nWe can look to rumors surrounding the S26 series to paint a picture of what to expect Wednesday. As it the norm, Samsung will likely release three main S26 units: the S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. It isn't clear whether the company will release an S26 Edge this year to follow up the S25 Edge.\n\nThe standard S26 seems like it'll be a small upgrade over the current S25, though with one key change: The new Galaxy will house its three rear cameras on a raised camera bump, following in the footsteps of Apple and Google. Rumors are split as to whether the cameras themselves will be upgraded, with some speculating that the Ultra will jump from 12MP to 50MP. The S26 may pack a 6.3-inch AMOLED display, a 4,300 mAh battery, up to 12GB of RAM, and possible up to 512GB of storage. Samsung may be running with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 to power the phone. The S26 Plus will likely be a similar phone, just with a larger 6.7-inch display.\n\nThe S26 Ultra looks like it'll launch with four rear cameras, with three of them contained to the bump out. As usual, the Ultra is the largest of the bunch, sporting a rumored 6.9-inch display. It could even be a bit thinner than the current S25 Ultra. The cameras may get some upgrades too, though the raw numbers appear to the same as the S25 Ultra. For example, while both may have 200MP main sensors, the S26's sensor may get some upgrades. It, too, could come with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip, as well as up to 16GB of RAM, up to 1TB of storage, a 5,000 mAh battery, and 60-watt fast wired charging.\n\nThe entire S25 series may also support 25W fast wireless charing, and may start selling a 25W Qi2 charger that supports it. They may all also support satellite communications, which would let users call and text emergency services and contacts without cellular network—similar to Apple's Emergency SOS via satellite on iPhone.\n\nSamsung will likely unveiled a new pair of earbuds Wednesday alongside the S26 series: Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 Pro. If the rumors are true, the Buds 4 will come in black and the Buds 4 Pro will come in white, though both will come with a charging case with a transparent lid. Besides color, the other big difference here is how the buds fit: The Buds 4 Pro are rumored to come with silicone tips, like AirPods Pro, while the Buds 4 do not, like Apple's standard AirPods.\n\nFinally, expect some big AI announcements, especially as they pertain to the S26 series. In a press release on Sunday, Samsung announced an \"expansion of Galaxy AI\" to support \"a choice of integrated agents.\" Specifically, Samsung is partnering with Perplexity to bring its AI agents to Galaxy devices. You'll be able to say \"Hey Plex\" to access the agent, and the bot will work across Samsung apps, like Calendar, Clock, Gallery, Notes, and Reminder.\n\nAt the same time, the company is currently testing the latest version of its own assistant, Bixby, with One UI 8.5. The goal is to let users ask Bixby for things on their Galaxy device, such as \"I don't want the screen to shut off when I'm looking at it,\" and the bot will adjust the proper settings in kind. The new Bixby can also access the web to answer questions, similar to other AI bots like ChatGPT or Gemini. Expect to hear more about this during Unpacked as well.",

    "description": "British number one Jack Draper marks his post-injury return to action on the ATP Tour with a straight-set win over Frenchman Quentin Halys at the Dubai Tennis Championships.",
    "fullText": "British number one Jack Draper said he felt \"really proud\" after marking his post-injury return to action on the ATP Tour with a straight-set victory over Frenchman Quentin Halys in Dubai.\n\nCompeting on the men's tour for the first time since the US Open last August, Draper won 7-6 (10-8) 6-3 on his debut at the Dubai Tennis Championships.\n\nThe 24-year-old, who has slipped to 15th in the world after reaching a career-high ranking of fourth in June, will play Hungary's Fabian Marozsan or France's Arthur Rinderknech next.\n\n\"I've been craving the feeling of competing for a very long time,\" Draper said in his post-match interview.\n\n\"It just felt normal, it felt like I was coming back to doing what I love, which is being out here, competing and having the adrenaline of winning and losing points.\n\n\"A lot of people have helped me to get back to this position after a lot of down moments [during] the last eight months.\n\n\"It's not been easy to be back here and that's something I can be really proud of. Long may it continue.\"\n\nDraper contested his first competitive match for 164 days when he played at the Davis Cup qualifiers earlier in February, beating Norway's Viktor Durasovic in straight sets.\n\nBut he had remained absent from tour singles competition since withdrawing from the US Open before his second-round match because of a left arm injury six months ago.\n\nDraper won the prestigious Masters 1,000 title at Indian Wells and reached the fourth round of the Australian and French Opens in a promising start to his 2025 season.\n\nBut he began struggling with a bruised bone in his service arm during the clay-court swing in April, and the issue progressively worsened.\n\nDetermined to complete a full recovery from the issue, Draper took the decision to miss the Australian Open in January before making his return for Great Britain on 5 February.\n\nSeeded fourth in Dubai, Draper had to withstand a set point when serving at 5-4 down in the opening set but went on to edge a tight tie-break by winning three consecutive points to overcome an 8-7 deficit.\n\nDespite first-set opportunities for both players, the first break of serve in the contest did not arrive until the fourth game of the second set when the 68th-ranked Halys hit wide to give Draper a 3-1 lead.\n\nDraper served out victory untroubled from there, conceding just two further points on serve as he ending the match with an impressive 86% win rate on his first serve.\n\nThe left-hander's successful recovery from injury was also underlined by the fact 19 of his 24 winners flew off his previously affected forehand side.\n\nThe post-victory celebration might have been reserved - a solemn face only briefly breaking into half a smile - but Draper will be delighted with his ATP Tour return, make no mistake.\n\nAn absence of nearly six months has undoubtedly been difficult for Draper to deal with.\n\nPulling out of January's Australian Open showed the severity of the bruised humerus on his dominant left arm - the bone running from the shoulder to the elbow - and the necessity to avoid any risks.\n\nSo too did the decision to withdraw from the ATP tournament in Rotterdam earlier this month.\n\nSome saw that move, coming after making his comeback with a routine Davis Cup win, as a red flag.\n\nFor Draper, though, it was all about playing the long game with a career which has been characterised by injury.\n\nBut there was no holding back against Halys. A pair of flaying forehands in the first two points of the match set the tone, followed by a booming ace at the start of an opening service game where he found his range with four out of five first serves.\n\nDraper was wearing a protective compression sleeve on the affected arm, but he continued to play freely and fluently from the baseline.\n\nIt has been clear for a while there is not a straightforward fix with an injury of this nature.\n\nGenerally speaking, the fear with a bruised humerus is the problem could lead to a more serious stress fracture with continued repetition and torsional stress - which tennis players clearly face.\n\nPatience has become a virtue which Draper has needed to learn - and, while this was an impressive return, he may still need more of it in the weeks and months ahead.\n\nLive scores, results and order of play\n\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Spanish giants Barcelona have signed Norwich City academy prospect Ajay Tavares.\n\nThe 16-year-old had reportedly attracted interest from a number of European clubs and Norwich will be entitled to compensation, although the Canaries have not confirmed the financial aspects of the deal.\n\nTavares, who first joined Norwich at under-12 level, was sent on as a substitute in a first-team pre-season friendly against Dutch club Volendam last summer when only 15, but he has not appeared in a competitive fixture at senior level.\n\n\"Whilst we are incredibly sad to be losing a young academy player of Ajay's talent, our overriding sense is one of immense pride,\" said Norwich sporting director Ben Knapper.\n\n\"Ajay's progress has been a testament to the fantastic work of everyone connected with our academy, who have impacted his journey and contributed to this wonderful achievement... and we couldn't be prouder to see him take this step to one of the most iconic football clubs and academies in world football.\"\n\nTavares made his most recent appearance for Norwich's under-18 team against Chelsea at Colney on 31 January.\n\n\"On an international level, he has represented England at under-15, under-16 and under-17 levels, and we've no doubt he'll continue to make great steps for both club and country in the years to come,\" Knapper added.\n\nHe is not the first 16-year-old to be signed by Barcelona from English football.\n\nIn 2019, Louie Barry joined them from West Bromwich Albion, but he returned the following year when Aston Villa paid a fee of about 1m euros (£880,000) for the young forward.\n\nThat was a year after Barcelona signed 18-year-old Marcus McGuane from Arsenal, with the midfielder joining their B side.\n\nMcGuane returned to England in 2020 to sign for Nottingham Forest and has since played for Oxford United, Bristol City and Huddersfield Town.\n\nLatest Norwich City news and analysis\n\nListen to BBC Radio Norfolk's The Scrimmage podcast",

    "description": "Striker Benjamin Sesko and goalkeeper Senne Lammens are the key figures as Manchester United gain a hugely valuable Premier League win at Everton.",
    "fullText": "Michael Carrick had a neat way of describing Benjamin Sesko's assimilation into life at Manchester United.\n\n\"He is growing as a player,\" said United's head coach. \"Sometimes it's big steps, sometimes it's little steps. He has taken some huge ones recently.\n\n\"The confidence and belief he is playing with is great to see.\"\n\nThe mighty strides Sesko has taken in United's latest two games have placed the club in a superb position to cement a return to the Champions League after a two-year absence.\n\nWithout the Slovenian's contributions off the bench, United would have lost at West Ham on 10 February and drawn with Everton on Monday on their first visit to Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\nSesko's goals have put Carrick's men out on their own in fourth spot, three points behind Aston Villa and three ahead of Chelsea and Liverpool.\n\nIf his stoppage-time volley to earn a point at West Ham was a thing of aesthetic beauty, his latest effort in the 71st minute of the 1-0 win at Everton was a feat of physical excellence.\n\nIt was a combination of endurance, running 70 yards at top speed after laying off a pass to Matheus Cunha, and calmness, to steady himself and coolly slot home Bryan Mbeumo's square pass.\n\n\"It was a great finish, a ruthless finish,\" said Carrick. \"I like the way he put it away with real confidence.\"\n\nWatching the game for Sky Sports, former Liverpool and England defender Jamie Carragher looked at the goal admiringly.\n\n\"Sesko has gone over 80 yards and then finishes,\" Carragher said. \"You expect him to be breathing heavily and panting after that. But no, he still has the energy to really celebrate.\"\n\nSesko has taken his goals tally to eight for the season.\n\nRemarkably, he only scored twice under Ruben Amorim, who signed him from RB Leipzig for £73.7m in August 2025.\n\nNow he has six in his latest seven games, starting with three in two matches while Darren Fletcher was in interim charge after Amorim's dismissal at the start of January.\n\nThat return has led many observers to feel Sesko is unlucky not to have made the starting XI for any of the six games Carrick has had at the helm.\n\nUnited's boss understands the debate. But he doesn't feel it is especially important.\n\n\"I get why everyone is talking about it and making a big deal of it, but it is not always as extreme,\" he said.\n\n\"I have got a really good relationship with Ben. We have had some good conversations, and he is in a good place.\n\n\"He obviously wants to play, but we have got some good forwards and I can't speak highly enough of how he has been.\"\n\nFor Sesko, it is about delivering when his manager asks – and he is brimming with the confidence to do that.\n\n\"I believe in me and so do the other players,\" Sesko told Sky Sports.\n\n\"They know what they are going to get when I arrive in the game. Whether that is five minutes or 90 minutes, it doesn't really matter. It's about showing I can deliver if I possibly can and I'm really happy with that.\"\n\nSesko comes off bench to score Man Utd winner at Everton\n\n'I'm not Schmeichel in disguise - I am just Senne Lammens'\n\nWho has made Troy's Premier League team of the week?\n\nIf Sesko broke Everton's hearts at one end of the field, another summer recruit, Senne Lammens, did it at the other.\n\nThe Belgian goalkeeper kept out a blockbuster strike from Michael Keane, which Moyes felt sure was going in, then dealt superbly with a series of corners dropped under his crossbar as Everton literally tried to force an equaliser.\n\n\"Their goalie was brilliant tonight,\" was Moyes' blunt reaction.\n\n\"The save he made from Michael, the way he dealt with corner kicks. The pressure we had. For me, their goalkeeper was the best player.\"\n\nCarrick is the one who benefits though, just as he is benefiting from the decision of United's recruitment department to block Amorim's calls to bring in Emi Martinez from Aston Villa on summer transfer deadline day and instead place their faith in a relatively young £18.1m goalkeeper with just one full season of senior football in Belgium behind him.\n\nLammens is 23. Sesko is 22. United might not quite be winning trophies with kids, but they have a young generation that is beginning to blossom.\n\nIt was brought to Carrick's attention after the Everton game that his former United team-mate and all-time great goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar was analysing the game on TV with Carragher.\n\nCarrick skilfully navigated the question of whether there are comparisons to be drawn between the two men.\n\n\"I've got to be careful what I say,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't want to be comparing them because I don't think it's fair to Senne. But there's definitely similarities.\n\n\"You want a goalkeeper to be reliable and trustworthy. Instead of creating a chaos, you want him to take the chaos away and calm things down. I think Senne is that.\n\n\"He's quite quiet at times and unassuming, but he's got real steel. It's a big role for some, and it's about being comfortable in your environment.\n\n\"Sometimes it takes time, sometimes not, but he has that calmness and composure. It helps those in front of him an awful lot.\"\n\nAt the start of the season, United's stated aim was to get back into Europe.\n\nEven internally, it was felt reaching the Europa League was the most realistic target, and financial estimates were created around that.\n\nHowever, in the wake of Amorim's exit, director of football Jason Wilcox spoke to the players about reaching the Champions League.\n\nThe difference in status and finance is huge.\n\nUnited have now gone 10 consecutive Premier League games without defeat for the first time since a run of 14 between January and May 2021 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\n\nFrom their current position, with no European distractions, which is something Villa, Chelsea and Liverpool all have, it would be a major disappointment for them if United were not to seal a return to European football's top table.\n\n\"Manchester United are now virtually guarantees for one of the Champions League places,\" said Carragher. \"I can't see them not making it.\"\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

This time will be the same result.\"\n\nMayweather has won all 50-0 of his professional fights, with 27 coming by knockout.\n\nHe has had a string of exhibition bouts since retiring in 2017 and is scheduled to face Mike Tyson this year.\n\nThat is set to be former undisputed world heavyweight champion Tyson's first fight since the American ended his 19-year retirement in November in a controversial defeat by Youtuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul.\n\nAnnouncing the end of his retirement on Saturday, Mayweather said: \"From my upcoming Mike Tyson event to my next professional fight afterwards: no-one will generate a bigger gate, have a larger global broadcast audience and generate more money with each event than my events.\"\n\nPacquiao, who has 62 wins from his 73 bouts, said in October that the pair were close to agreeing a rematch – but added it was dependent on he and Mayweather being able to \"understand each other\".\n\nTheir previous meeting in 2015 generated a record 4.6 million pay-per-view buys and a record live gate of $72m at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.\n\nFull details regarding the undercard and ticket availability will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nWhat a chaotic few days it's been for boxing. After Conor Benn's shock move to Zuffa, the sport has barely had time to reset. But perhaps nothing in boxing should shock us any more.\n\nThe first Mayweather-Pacquiao fight was the one everyone demanded for years, yet when it finally arrived in 2015, it had come too late. And then it never lived up to the billing.\n\nSince then, nobody really has been clamouring for a rematch. Certainly not in 2026.\n\nWhen the rematch was announced, most boxing fans on social media assumed this would be an exhibition. It isn't.\n\nThe finer details are still unclear but if there are any special rules or conditions attached, that's unlikely to go down well with purists.\n\nThere is one hook: Mayweather putting his unbeaten record on the line. And with Netflix involved, you can expect the full promotional treatment - it will be sold as a global event for the casual sports fan.\n\nUltimately, both men will bank enormous purses for revisiting old ground, and it's hard to escape the feeling that this is being driven more by the money than anything else.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Italian cricket is in crisis days after the country's T20 World Cup debut, as it emerged that a senior national governing body official has been investigated over a sexual assault allegation.\n\nFederazione Cricket Italiana (FCRI) women's cricket co-ordinator Prabath Ekneligoda, 57, was the subject of a criminal investigation relating to a claim he inappropriately touched a member of the Azzurri women's national team.\n\nMultiple members of the Italy board are said to have resigned over this case and other governance issues, BBC Sport has been told.\n\nThe sexual assault allegation was made to police in Rome in March last year by a player who has represented the national team.\n\nThe player, whose identity is protected for legal reasons, alleged that the sexual assault occurred during a massage on a knee injury at a training session, and she had been scared to report the incident because she feared it would cost her a spot in the team.\n\nAn investigation was concluded by a Rome prosecutor in November 2025 and Ekneligoda was interviewed by police the following month.\n\nA decision is now set to be made on whether there is sufficient evidence to bring it to trial. Ekneligoda's lawyer said his client denies the allegation, that there are ulterior motives to the allegation, and that a witness supports his version of events.\n\nFCRI said in a statement to BBC Sport it \"noted proceedings are currently under way before the federal prosecutor's office\" and will \"co-operate with the relevant authorities\".\n\n\"The Italian Cricket Federation reiterates that its conduct is guided by principles of fairness, transparency and the protection of its registered members, as well as by the ethical and civic standards that underpin the sporting system,\" added the statement.\n\n\"The federation therefore defers to the competent judicial authorities for any determinations arising from the matter.\"\n\nEkneligoda, who is originally from Sri Lanka, was suspended from his role with the FCRI in November but has remained a visible presence on the Italian cricket scene.\n\nHe is the partner of FCRI president Maria Lorena Haz Paz and accompanied her to India for the men's T20 World Cup.\n\nBBC Sport has seen evidence that Ekneligoda attended Italy's matches wearing official accreditation and was permitted to sit with the rest of the FCRI party.\n\nEkneligoda was also seen at various events laid on for Italy's cricket delegation, including a reception at the Italian consulate in Kolkata for officials, players and coaching staff.\n\nThe FCRI, its president Haz Paz, and safeguarding officers, had full knowledge of the seriousness of the claim made against Ekneligoda before the World Cup.\n\nLast weekend, Il Messaggero, external and Corriere della Sera, external reported the allegation in the Italian media for the first time.\n\nAs of Monday, Ekneligoda was still listed as the women's cricket coordinator on the FCRI website.\n\nSources have told BBC Sport that some members of the FCRI's board have resigned over the matter, and other governance issues, which has placed Haz Paz's position under greater scrutiny.\n\nSenior officials in Italian cricket fear potential reputational damage, and the possibility of legal cases, will hamper opportunities to capitalise on their debut T20 World Cup appearance and grow the game further in the country.\n\nHaz Paz was appointed president of the Italian cricket federation in February 2025 until 2028.\n\nItaly's debut at the T20 World Cup, and the stories of some of their players, had captured the imagination of the cricket world.\n\nThe Azzurri failed to make the Super 8 stage but beat Nepal in Mumbai and gave England a scare in Kolkata in their Group C fixtures.\n\nIPL-linked teams 'not considering Pakistan players'\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\n\n'It smacks of England' - Australia fail again at T20 World Cup",

    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nDean Henderson (Crystal Palace): Not a great weekend for goalkeepers in terms of the shots faced. But a penalty save and a clean sheet against a poor Wolves team was big for Crystal Palace who really needed that win.\n\nVirgil van Dijk (Liverpool): People have been questioning whether he or John Terry is the better Premier League centre-back. For me, Van Dijk is just a Rolls-Royce and the two of them go in the same category. He delivers all the time and has started to make Milos Kerkez look better with his organisation. It was a tough game against Forest but he stood up and delivered.\n\nHarry Maguire (Manchester United): Mr Dependable. I was going to put Luke Shaw in but Harry just got the nod. Manchester United are on a great run under Michael Carrick and look like they are continuing to be a solid team, and Maguire being fit and available has coincided with that. He was great for Ruben Amorim and now he's great again. Not so long ago, they were trying to shift him out for anything and now he is the Guvnor.\n\nLewis Hall (Newcastle): I had to find a place for him because he has been fantastic over the course of the Premier League and even though his goal against Manchester City was a deflected strike, I just thought he was brilliant.\n\nNico O'Reilly (Manchester City): The player of the weekend for me, and the player of the month by a country mile. Since O'Reilly has moved into that midfield, Rodri has looked better, Manchester City have looked better, he has looked amazing and the job he has done for the past 18 months at left-back shows his versatility. What a player. Both his goals against Newcastle were great and totally different. He offers so much to Manchester City and is a shoo-in for the England squad. We were looking at him as a left-back but does he now play midfield?\n\nAnton Stach (Leeds): I thought Leeds might falter and fall away. I think they have to be careful with these draws but he was a really good performer against Aston Villa - and that free-kick he scored against a World-Cup winning goalkeeper in Emi Martinez means he goes in my team.\n\nEberechi Eze (Arsenal): He has to go in this week with his two goals against Spurs on Sunday. He has scored five goals against them now in two games - so Spurs are obviously his team to face. Good for him and good for Mikel Arteta to pick him. He has been up and down this season, in and out of the team, but this will be a real confidence booster for him and Arsenal.\n\nDiego Gomez (Brighton): He got a goal in the win against Brentford, but it was also an important midfield performance from him. Brentford weren't at their best, with injuries in the squad, but you have to be able to break through the lines and he did that a lot. He was fantastic. It was Brighton's first win in seven league games and they needed it.\n\nZian Flemming (Burnley): Yes, he scored against Chelsea, but it was an old-school number nine performance. I have got a lot of time for this sort of display. He was horrible, he was beating people up, making little fouls, and was a real nuisance. He was doing it to the point where Chelsea were getting so frustrated, he was probably part of the reason why Wesley Fofana got sent off.\n\nViktor Gyokeres (Arsenal): He scored two against Spurs. Yes, the opposition were mediocre with a terrible backline but he doesn't care. The rest of his play was better as well. I can't give him too much credit, but you can only score against the teams put in front of you.\n\nRaul Jimenez (Fulham): He goes through these spells when he scores a run of goals and he looks a real top player. Then he goes quiet again. He scored another couple of goals at Sunderland on Sunday - he is a big powerful player, and the one thing you know is he is going to work that backline on his own.\n\nMikel Arteta (Arsenal): It was a big week for the Arsenal manager. With Manchester City winning, there was a lot of pressure on his team going into the north London derby against a poor Spurs team. Arsenal had to handle the pressure and they did that very well. I give Arteta all the credit. He is handling it every step of the way.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?
