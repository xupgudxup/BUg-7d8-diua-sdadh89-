    "fullText": "Are the Rockets using Reed Sheppard correctly? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Houston Rockets were a team filled with top-end talent and deep playoff run aspirations after the Kevin Durant trade. However, Fred VanVleet’s torn ACL injury in the preseason derailed the hype, with Houston left scrambling to fix the glaring hole at the point guard position. While results have remained relatively consistent from last season to now, the team’s lack of a controller down the stretch has led to some tough losses, with the most recent example being Houston’s loss to the New York Knicks, where they blew an 18-point lead in the fourth quarter.\n\nA development that some people noticed from the game was that guard Reed Sheppard, who knocked down 10 points in 21 minutes, was absent from the closing stretches. That begs the question: Could Reed Sheppard have helped Houston avoid their late-game collapse? And, could he be the answer going forward at the point guard slot as Houston gears for the playoffs?\n\nSI’s @a_duckett thinks Reed Sheppard can “unlock” Houston’s offense if Ime Udoka plays him more\n\n“Reed Sheppard is the only guard on the roster that can unlock the Rockets' offense, whether by playmaking or long-range shooting. He can't do that if he's not on the floor.” pic.twitter.com/KvG1Cya3rN\n\n— SleeperRockets (@SleeperRockets) February 22, 2026\n\nReed Sheppard has stepped up and received more minutes this year compared to his rookie campaign, which can be partly attributed to necessity due to injuries. However, it seems like coach Ime Udoka still doesn’t fully trust him with minutes in crunch time. After the team’s crushing loss to the Knicks, Udoka demanded that he be “more demonstrative and get us into our sets.” For as much as Udoka can complain about Sheppard, the second-year player was absent for most of the collapse against New York.\n\nIn their next game against the Utah Jazz, which was a 125-105 win for Houston, Reed Sheppard displayed the qualities that have fans complaining about his usage. He shot well from the field, created offensive opportunities, and most importantly, controlled the pace of play. Last year, VanVleet was the controller, and although he wasn’t elite by any means, he provided a calming presence and poise when games got tight.\n\nReed Sheppard could step into that role, and he’s most likely the closest fit currently available. It’ll be up to Ime Udoka to decide if his young guard is ready to take the next step, but as of now, it seems like Sheppard still has a ways to go before earning that trust.\n\nLakers' LeBron James sends seven-word message to Jaylen Brown after viral Bronny James diss\n\nDonovan Mitchell admits the OKC Thunder are overly physical, but teams have to adapt\n\nCason Wallace knew how to step up in the pressure-packed matchup against the Cavaliers\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander saves the day in hilarious Jared McCain vlog",

    "fullText": "After the biggest win of the season over Iowa State, BYU stays home when UCF comes to the Marriott Center late Tuesday night.\n\nUCF is approaching lock status for the NCAA Tournament, and a road win over BYU would just about secure that. UCF is coming off a two-point road win at Utah Saturday without leading scorer Riley Kugel. Kugel is listed as questionable versus BYU.\n\nThe game tips off at 9pm MT on ESPN2.\n\nBest Wins: Texas A&M (A), Kansas (H), Kansas State (A), Colorado (A), Arizona State (H), Texas Tech (H), TCU (H), Utah (A)\n\nLosses: Vanderbilt (H), Oklahoma State (A), Arizona (H), Iowa State (A), Houston (A), Cincinnati (A), West Virginia (H)\n\nKenPom Prediction: BYU 89, UCF 78 — BYU 84% win probability\n\nUCF is considered a consensus tournament team. According to Bracket Matrix — which aggregates 121 bracket projections — UCF is in by each bracket projection and projected a 9 seed.\n\nIn Big 12 play, UCF ranks 7th in KenPom offensive efficiency and 12th in defensive efficiency. Two things that jump out about UCF is their ability to hit the three ball and ability to keep turnovers relatively in check. UCF shoots 35% from three in league play (#3 in Big 12) and are sixth in turnover percentage. They have four players average between 12-14 ppg and then a gap to the next player. UCF is bottom half in the Big 12 in offensive rebound percentage, free throw rate, and two-point percentage.\n\nDefensively, UCF has been susceptible this season. They don’t force a ton of turnovers and really struggle defending inside the three point line. UCF is top half in the conference in three-point defense, but opponents shoot a blistering 58% from two (last in Big 12). AJ and Rob could have a lot of success in the paint this game.\n\nUCF has some really nice wins on their resume that show they are clearly capable — they won at Texas A&M and beat Kansas and Texas Tech at home. They are 3-4 on the road in Big 12 play some of those losses have been ugly; their four road losses have come by a combined 18 points.\n\nUCF leading scorer Riley Kugel is listed as questionable.\n\nRiley Kugel, Guard — Kugel’s availability will be a main storyline to watch. The 6-foot-5 guard averages 14 points on 38% shooting from three. Kugel only has one 20+ point game in conference play, but he is a consistent double-digit scorer.\n\nThemus Fulks, Point Guard — Fulks is right there with Kugel in scoring, also averaging 14 ppg, and leads the team with 6.7 assists per game. Fulks has the ball in his hands a lot and is either creating for himself or others. He does most of his damage inside the arc and shoots 48% on 11 field goal attempts per game. He averages only 1.4 three-point attempts per game, but does shoot 43% on those.\n\nJordan Burks, Forward — The 6-foot-9 wing averages 13 points and shoots 39% from distance on nearly 5 attempts per game. Burks will probably get some time matched up on AJ due to his length.\n\nJamichael Stillwell, Forward — The final piece of UCF’s top four guys, Stillwell averages 12 points and leads UCF in rebounds (7.8) and steals (1.2). At 6-foot-8 and 225 pounds, Stillwell is a physical forward who can create mismatches with his strength in the paint.\n\nUCF is a good team who is capable of pulling an upset here. BYU is coming off its biggest win of the season and is ripe for a letdown if players aren’t locked in. With or without Kugel, UCF has enough options to give BYU’s defense trouble. If Kugel can go, then BYU will need to be locked in defensively. UCF is balanced offensively in their starting five, and BYU has often struggled against teams where they can’t really lock in on just a couple guys. Iowa State is better than UCF, but BYU knew they had to give Momcilovic no space.\n\nI ultimately like BYU. One, I don’t think UCF can slow down BYU enough. UCF is terrible at defending the paint and midrange, so I could see both AJ Dybantsa and Rob Wright having big games. This could be a game where AJ scores 35+ points and throws multiple lobs to AJ after breakdowns from UCF’s back line. I also just have a hard time seeing BYU losing this game in Provo, especially with some of UCF’s road struggles.\n\nI’ll pick BYU to win but UCF to keep within striking distance most of the game.",

    "description": "As Snoop Dogg attends his first Swansea City game, BBC Sport Wales looks at how the sport-loving American rapper became an investor in the Welsh club.",
    "fullText": "Microphone in hand, shades on despite the dimmed lights, Snoop Dogg is going through a back catalogue of hits that has made him one of the biggest hip hop stars in the world.\n\nAll while wearing a Swansea City beanie hat and hoodie.\n\nIf the social media videos from Monday night's private party in an industrial estate on the outskirts of the city don't seem surreal enough, Tuesday night will see Snoop take his seat at the Swansea.Com Stadium for his first game since becoming an investor in the Championship club.\n\nAfter the introduction of Hollywood to EFL ownership at Wrexham with Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac, here is Swansea City's next episode.\n\n\"It's a bit different, I think you can say that,\" says Swans supporter and fanzine editor Steven Carroll, understatedly summing up the feeling of a fanbase.\n\n\"But it's definitely captured the imagination and that can only be a positive.\"\n\nSwansea have 'job to do' as Snoop Dogg visits\n\nSnoop Dogg aiming to make Swansea a 'global name'\n\nResponsible for selling 35 million records worldwide, Snoop Dogg can now add record ticket sales to his resume.\n\nThe club have opened up sections of the away end because of the spike in interest, meaning not only have the 'sold out' signs gone up for the visit of Preston North End, the game is also set to see more Swansea fans in the ground than ever before.\n\nIt's a short term hit of buzz for a club that lost its way after relegation from the Premier League in 2018.\n\nEyes, however, are now on a return - with the involvement of Snoop part of a longer-term plan that Swansea chief executive Tom Gorringe says has \"no limits\".\n\nBrought on board by the club's US owners Brett Cravatt and Jason Cohen in July, Snoop's minority stake didn't mean a large injection of cash.\n\nBut it did mean a huge boost to its ability to sell itself.\n\n\"The reality is that if we operated within our natural resources we couldn't compete financially,\" says Gorringe, speaking just after helping show Snoop around the club's training base on Monday afternoon where he met players and staff.\n\n\"PSR (profit and sustainability rules) is our biggest constraint. We are up against sides with parachute payments and we have one of the lowest turnovers.\n\n\"We have to think of new ways to generate income. We are an underdog and part of the attraction for him is the difference he can make with the pull he naturally has.\"\n\nThat pull includes more than 100 million social media followers – more than Wrexham's ownership combined – that Swansea have already looked to make the most of.\n\nBeyond growing the brand and the wider fan base, which Gorringe admits \"takes time\", there have already been tangible benefits.\n\nIncome has seen tie-ins, including clothing collaborations with Snoop's own publishing label, the iconic Death Row Records that was once the home of Dr Dre and Tupac Shakur.\n\n\"By December, our retail business surpassed last year's revenue,\" says Gorringe, who has previously suggested that sponsorship deals for next year are set to be bigger and better than any previous agreement.\n\nWhy Swansea would want to have Snoop on board – and in the stadium – is obvious. Why Snoop is at Swansea could seem less so.\n\nHis history, though, suggests he's not short of entrepreneurialism, including investing in social news site Reddit in 2014.\n\nThe opportunity at Swansea combined that interest with his long-held association with sport, most recently seen during his role as Team USA's 'honorary coach' at the Winter Olympics.\n\nWhether cheering on competitors or trying out the sports themselves – including curling - he combined his role with work for US broadcasters, as he did at the Summer Games in Paris for which he won an Emmy. Views of his videos for NBC in Milan-Cortina are reported to have hit 73 million.\n\nHis love of NFL is well known too. A Pittsburgh fan, he's arranged for every fan at tomorrow's game to have a Snoop and Swansea branded towel to emulate the twirling performed by Steelers crowds.\n\nQuite how the Preston fans respond to that sight is another thing.\n\n\"That's actually part of the attraction,\" laughs Gorringe when asked if he's told the self-confessed 'soccer' fan about what to expect. \"He's watched enough of how fans interact here and that it's very different to US sports. He loves that passion and tribalism.\"\n\nSnoop's friend and fellow minority investor, US TV personality and billionaire businesswoman Martha Stewart, has already sampled the EFL environment after attending the December win over Wrexham.\n\nGiven how long it has taken Snoop to experience such atmospheres for himself, there will be those who wonder if this is more gimmick that genuine.\n\nUnlike at Wrexham, Snoop has no formal role, no decision-making power, just contributions and offers to help in the ways he can.\n\nBut similarly to how Reynolds and Mac have emotionally invested in north Wales, buying into something bigger is seen as part of the desire to get involved.\n\n\"There's a definite excitement about being part of things and he was really engaged in it all - but it's clear he's aware there's a responsibility,\" adds Gorringe. \"He wants to learn more about the city and the community because he sees that as an important role.\n\n\"It would be easy for this to be done as a PR stunt but understanding the city is the heart of who we are and who he is.\"\n\nIn other words, someone who didn't always find life easy has an affinity for the 'underdog', predominantly working class, city.\n\nIt's why some of the first meetings at the training ground were with the kitmen and team chef, not only long-serving members of staff but very much of the local area and die-hard fans.\n\nIt is also why Snoop bought up a number of tickets for Tuesday's game himself so he can donate to community groups.\n\n\"Who knows, the weather might be nice and he might think the Gower is better than LA,\" laughs Steven Carroll of the SoS (Save our Swans) fanzine.\n\n\"We'll see what happens, but he's the biggest celebrity to ever step foot in Swansea and its an association we seem to be benefitting from.\n\n\"It doesn't even matter if he doesn't know the players' names, that's not what he's here for.\"\n\nStewart joins Snoop and Modric as Swans co-owner\n\nBallon d'Or to boardroom – why Swansea for Modric?\n\nSwansea's third high-profile investor is more likely to have an influence on that front.\n\nFormer Ballon d'Or winner Luka Modric is also a minority shareholder - but is yet to make his first visit as he continues to perform at the top level with AC Milan.\n\nThe 40-year-old Croatia captain is described by Gorringe as \"an unbelievable asset\" who watches every game and is \"really integrated\" as he prepares for a life after playing.\n\nHe has spoken to Snoop on Swansea, just as Snoop met and spoke with manager Vitor Matos on Monday, with the Swans' former Liverpool coach denying the spotlight is a distraction as they aim to keep the play-offs in range.\n\n\"It's always good and exciting for the club, for the city, having someone like him with his profile,\" said Matos, whose side are six points off the top six.\n\n\"When you have people who care about the club on the top of the organisation it's always good.\n\n\"But what motivates us and what needs to motivate us is the fans, the noise of the people in the stands, it's about a granddad taking his grandchild to the stadium, the legacy that you bring to the stadium from old times to now.\n\n\"I think that's what we want to build from and Snoop is another person to help us do that.\"\n\nEven it does all seem a little surreal.\n\nLatest Swansea City news, analysis and fan views",

    "title": "Lasses Spotlight: Poppy Pattinson — A Lioness Forged In Sunderland!",
    "description": "“Pattinson’s story is one of dedication, growth and homegrown pride”, writes Charlotte Patterson.",
    "fullText": "When Poppy Pattinson received her first senior England call up last week, it felt like a moment to which her career had been quietly building for years.\n\nFor those who’ve followed her journey from the very beginning — particularly Sunderland supporters who watched her grow from a determined youngster into a polished professional — the news carried a familiar sense of pride.\n\nPattinson isn’t the first player to rise from Sunderland’s academy to the international stage and nor will she be the last. Every time it happens, it highlights something deeply embedded within the club’s identity: Sunderland AFC Women is one of the most important talent factories in English football.\n\nPattinson’s story is not only about her own perseverance and development. It’s also about the environment that shaped her, the club that nurtured her and the lineage of exceptional footballers who walked the same path before her.\n\nFrom Lucy Bronze to Jill Scott; from Steph Houghton to Beth Mead, Sunderland’s academy has produced some of the most influential figures in the modern women’s game — and Pattinson now joins that extraordinary list.\n\nBorn in Houghton-le-Spring in 2000, Pattinson grew up on the outskirts of Wearside, surrounded by a footballing culture that runs deeply throughout the region.\n\nShe joined Sunderland Girls Academy at the age of eight and spent five formative years there, developing the technical foundations and competitive instincts that would define her career. Her early years at the club coincided with a period when Sunderland were becoming a powerhouse in women’s football development, producing players who would go on to shape the national team for more than a decade.\n\nHer first spell at Sunderland ended when she moved to Middlesbrough at thirteen, but the pull of home and of Sunderland proved strong.\n\nIn 2015, she returned to the club — this time stepping into the senior environment.\n\nShe made her senior debut during the 2017 Spring Series, featuring twice in WSL 1 for the Black Cats, and in those brief appearances, she showed the qualities that would become her trademarks: composure on the ball, intelligence in her positioning and a willingness to drive forward from left back.\n\nFor Sunderland fans, witnessing a local girl break into the first team is always special, and seeing one who’d come through the academy from childhood made it even more meaningful. Pattinson was one of their own, another young talent shaped by the club’s ethos of hard work, humility and ambition.\n\nFollowing the 2017 Spring Series, Pattinson made the bold decision to join Manchester City — a move that reflected her ambition.\n\nAt the time, City were one of the top sides in the country and competition for places was fierce. Although she didn’t make a competitive senior appearance, she was a key figure in the club’s development squad, helping them win both the FA WSL Academy League Northern Division and the Development League Cup.\n\nPattinson’s next step came in 2018, when she signed for Bristol City.\n\nUnder manager Tanya Oxtoby, Pattinson flourished, becoming an integral part of the team and missing just one league match in her first season as Bristol finished sixth in the WSL. Her second season was disrupted by injury, but she returned in December 2019 to help the club battle against relegation and by the time her contract expired in 2020, she had established herself as one of the league’s most promising young full back.\n\nEverton came calling that summer, offering her a two year deal, and Pattinson continued to grow on Merseyside, making thirty nine appearances across all competitions and scoring her first senior goal.\n\nHer time at Everton showcased her increasing maturity. She was no longer just a promising youngster — she’d become a reliable, consistent performer in one of the league’s most competitive environments.\n\nIn 2022, she moved to Brighton and Hove Albion, where she added another layer to her game, scoring her first goal for the club in an FA Cup win over Birmingham City in March 2023 and becoming a regular presence in the side across three seasons. Her performances were marked by a blend of defensive discipline and attacking intent. — the hallmarks of a modern full back.\n\nPattinson’s England journey has been steady and consistent, representing her country at U17, U19, U21 and U23 level, scoring in the 2017 UEFA Women’s Under 17 Championship and featuring prominently in multiple youth tournaments.\n\nHer progression through the age groups reflected her reliability and adaptability — qualities that England managers value highly — and her senior call up in 2026 felt like the natural next step.\n\nIt wasn’t the result of a sudden breakthrough. It was the product of years of hard work, steady improvement and consistent performances across the WSL. For Sunderland supporters, it was a moment of immense pride as another academy graduate reached the highest level of the game.\n\nTo understand why Pattinson’s call up resonates so deeply on Wearside, you have to understand Sunderland’s extraordinary history in women’s football development.\n\nThe club’s academy has produced some of the most influential players in England’s modern era, from Lucy Bronze, (widely regarded as one of the best full backs in the world), Steph Houghton, a former England captain and a defining figure in the WSL, and Jill Scott, a Lionesses legend with more than 150 caps.\n\nSunderland also nurtured Beth Mead, a Euro 2022 Golden Boot winner and Player of the Tournament, Jordan Nobbs, a creative midfielder with a decade of international experience, Carly Telford, a longstanding goalkeeper. Demi Stokes, a key part of England’s defensive unit for years, and Lucy Staniforth, a technically gifted midfielder with international pedigree.\n\nThis list is not only impressive — it’s transformative.\n\nThese players have shaped the identity of the Lionesses, contributed to England’s rise on the global stage, and inspired countless young girls across the country, and Pattinson now joins that lineage. She’s part of a legacy that stretches back more than a decade, a legacy built on the foundations of Sunderland’s commitment to youth development, community engagement and opportunity.\n\nThere’s no single explanation for Sunderland’s remarkable success in producing elite footballers, but several factors stand out.\n\nThe region’s footballing culture is deeply ingrained. Wearside is a place where football is more than a sport. It’s a shared identity; a source of pride and a constant presence in daily life. Young players grow up surrounded by passion, expectation and community support.\n\nSunderland’s academy has long prioritised technical development and competitive experience. Players are encouraged to express themselves, to play with intelligence and to understand the game deeply. This approach has consistently produced footballers who are tactically astute and adaptable.\n\nHistorically, this club has provided opportunities for young players to step into senior football earlier than they might’ve done elsewhere. For many — including Pattinson — those early senior experiences are invaluable.\n\nThere’s also the influence of role models and when young players see Bronze or Mead succeeding on the world stage, knowing they once stood where they stand now, it creates a powerful sense of possibility.\n\nFor Sunderland supporters, Pattinson’s England call up is not only a personal achievement for her — it’s a reaffirmation of the club’s identity. Even during periods when the senior team has faced challenges, the academy remained a beacon of excellence and a reminder that Sunderland’s contribution to the women’s game extends far beyond league tables or match results.\n\nPattinson represents the continuation of a proud tradition. She’s a local girl who grew up in the academy, made her senior debut in red and white and has now reached the highest level of international football. Her journey embodies the values Sunderland hold dear: resilience, ambition, and loyalty to one’s roots.\n\nThere’s also a sense of collective pride.\n\nSunderland fans have watched her grow, move through the leagues, overcome injuries and refine her game. They’ve followed her career not only because she’s talented, but because she is one of theirs and every step she takes on the international stage reflects back on the club that helped shape her.\n\nPattinson’s England call up is likely just the beginning.\n\nAt twenty five, she’s entering her prime years as a defender and her experience across multiple WSL clubs, as well as her tactical intelligence and her consistency, makes her a strong candidate for a long international career.\n\nFor Sunderland, her success reinforces the club’s reputation as a cradle of talent. It also inspires the next generation of academy players, who can look at Pattinson and see a clear pathway from Wearside to the world stage.\n\nPattinson’s story is one of dedication, growth and homegrown pride. She’s the latest in a long line of exceptional footballers forged in Sunderland’s academy and her rise to the England senior squad is a testament to both her own hard work and the club’s enduring commitment to developing elite talent.\n\nFor Sunderland supporters, her journey is a reminder of what their club stands for: local identity, community, and the belief that world class footballers can come from the streets and schools of Wearside.\n\nAs Pattinson hopefully steps onto the pitch in an England shirt for the first time as a senior, she’ll carry not only her own dreams but the hopes and pride of a region that’s always believed in her.\n\nIn doing so, she’ll ensure that Sunderland’s remarkable conveyor belt of talent continues to roll along— strong, steady and unstoppable.",

    "description": "The John R.",
    "fullText": "The John R. Wooden Award will celebrate it’s 50th anniversary this season. Leading up to the award ceremony on April 10, 2026, The Sporting Tribune in partnership with the Wooden Award and the Los Angeles Athletic Club will highlight past winners of the Wooden Award and the Legends of Coaching Award.\n\nSure, Tubby Smith led the Kentucky Wildcats to the 1998 NCAA championship in his first season at the University of Kentucky, but that's not what separated him as one of the greatest college basketball coaches ever.\n\nRather, Smith - the recipient of the Wooden Legend of Coach Award in 2016 - stood out because of his rare combination of championship credibility, defensive identity, and personal integrity, intangibles that made him respected across college basketball.\n\nWhile Kentucky is one of the most pressure-packed jobs in sports, figure stepping in after Rick Pitino and having to deliver immediately made things even worse. It was a challenge he never wavered from in 1998, as his team mirrored his coaching tenacity, staring adversity in the face.\n\nThe Wildcats came back from double-digit deficits multiple times in the NCAA tournament that year, earning the nickname \"The Comeback Cats.\"\n\nSo again, yes, winning the title validated him instantly at the highest level, but he needed to carry out the legacy in some fashion.\n\nBeyond Kentucky, though, Smith had stellar runs with programs in tough conferences, like Georgia in the SEC, Minnesota in the Big 10 and Texas Tech in the Big 12.\n\nSmith proved he could win outside of a blue-blood environment.\n\nLike at Minnesota, where his teams weren’t always the most talented, but were organized and hard to score on. All of his teams were traditionally known for their physical half-court defense, structured offensive sets, limited mistakes and high accountability.\n\nIn emphasizing traditional guarding, rebounding and execution, Smith utilized an old-school mentality that instilled true fundamentals to win games.\n\nAnd in games, one of Smith's biggest strengths was his calm, principled leadership style. Never known as a flashy coach, you didn't see him chase headlines and his players understood the importance of academics and character.\n\nHe won five regular-season SEC championships and five SEC tournaments, was named the consensus Coach of the Year in 2003 and was a six-time conference coach of the year in three different leagues.\n\nFrom a cultural standpoint, Smith was an inspiration for the Black community as he became the first African American head coach to win a national championship at Kentucky.\n\nHe will go down as one of the most respected Black coaches in the SEC, and it was his representation that mattered, and still does, considering his resume, record and some of the players he's coached.\n\nSmith was able to stand out because he combined championship-level credibility, defensive identity, composure under pressure and integrity alongside professionalism.\n\nSmith may not always get mentioned with the flashiest names, but coaches around the game deeply respect what he built.\n\nFact is, when mentioning names among coaching greats, like Mike Krzyzewski, Tom Izzo, Bill Self, you cannot leave Smith out of the conversation, as his legacy stands out more so because of steadiness and substance than spotlight.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United registered a hard-fought win away to Everton, opening up a three-point lead over Chelsea and Liverpool.\n\nBenjamin Sesko came off the bench to score United’s winner with a first-time finish. Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha were also involved in the decisive counter-attack, which left Everton’s otherwise solid backline exposed.\n\nFor most of the night in Merseyside, the Red Devils’ attack was flat, to say the least. It was their defensive resilience that paved the way for Michael Carrick’s fifth win since his return to the touchline.\n\nDavid Moyes, as usual, set up a very compact block, giving Manchester United limited space and time on the ball in the final third.\n\nHowever, Everton, to their credit, did not lack intensity or urgency going forward, creating a number of chances and winning a staggering 10 corners. They also had twice as many shots on target as the visitors.\n\nStill, United returned home with a clean sheet and all three points, largely due to the brilliance of Senne Lammens.\n\nThe 23-year-old started nervously at Hill Dickinson Stadium, gifting possession of the ball to Thierno Barry. However, he recovered swiftly, making a number of impressive saves.\n\nMore importantly, the Belgian added much-needed calmness in the six-yard box during set-pieces, as Everton players tried to pack the area and unsettle the United number one.\n\nMoyes took note of Lammens‘ performance when analysing Everton’s display and the final scoreline.\n\nThe former United manager told Sky Sports (via The Independent): “The goalie was bloody brilliant. The save he made from Michael Keane, the way he dealt with the corners.”\n\nMoyes went on to claim the United youngster was the best player in Merseyside on Monday night.\n\n“We hoped somewhere we’d have got a nick on one of them with the pressure we had in those situations. I thought we would get one, but we didn’t. For me he was the best player on the pitch,” the Scot said.\n\nThis was United’s first away clean sheet in the Premier League since March 2025, and Lammens’ third in the last six.\n\nFeature image Michael Regan via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "As part of the \"Real-Club-Legends\" event, former national team player and Real Madrid professional Sami Khedira spoke about the future of Xabi Alonso – and made it clear that, despite Alonso's exit from Madrid, he has no doubts about his quality.\n\nFor Khedira, one thing is certain: Alonso's coaching career has by no means stalled.\n\n“I am sure that he will continue to be one of the best coaches in the world. What he achieved with Leverkusen was outstanding. If you look back at the first four months in Leverkusen, he struggled there as well. He lost some games, the results weren't so good. It took time to implement his system. His style of play needs time, communication on the pitch, understanding from the players, and trust,” explained the 2014 World Cup winner.\n\nIt was precisely this time, Khedira said, that Alonso did not get at Real Madrid. The club operates differently, the pressure is different – and patience is often in short supply. “Maybe he focused too much on his own style and not on the style his top players would have needed. That might be the most important point. Real Madrid is, of course, something special,” said Khedira.\n\nNevertheless, for him it's clear: It's only a matter of time before the 44-year-old is back on the sidelines of a European heavyweight. “I believe that Xabi Alonso will soon be the coach of a top club. In Europe, in England, or elsewhere. He will be a champion again.”\n\nKhedira can even imagine a comeback at Real Madrid in the long term. “I'm also pretty sure that, let's say in 10 or 15 years, he will be coach at Real Madrid again,” he said – and added an interesting assessment: “Then he will be a different coach, not necessarily a better one, but perhaps a different one, to deal better with the situation.”\n\nFor Khedira, Alonso already brings everything needed for the biggest challenges. He already sees him in the same league as the most prominent coaching personalities in modern football: “I see him on the same level as (José) Mourinho, (Pep) Guardiola, and (Carlo) Ancelotti. He has everything that makes a top coach.”\n\nA clear vote of confidence – and a prediction that suggests Alonso’s coaching career still has many chapters ahead, despite setbacks.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "title": "The Market for Marriage",
    "description": "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good agricultural surplus, must be in want of a wife.",
    "fullText": "In the 1930s in the Upper Nile region of what is now South Sudan, anthropologist EE Evans-Pritchard met a Nuer woman sitting by a thatched hut with her children. In the distance, the father of her children tended the cattle. They looked like an ordinary family. But this man was not her husband. The Nuer woman was married to a ghost, and her children were officially the children of this ghost.\n\nAmong the Nuer, if a man died without leaving any heirs his kinsmen would find him a wife, in order for his name to live on. They worried that otherwise his ghost would grow restless, haunting and bringing sickness upon them. ‘A ghost likes to think of people asking, “whose son is that?” and being told in reply that it is the son of so-and-so’, the Nuer say. ‘Thus, his name continues on the lips of men’.\n\nEvans-Pritchard, who lived with the Nuer for a number of years, observed that ghost marriages were nearly as common as those between the living. Warfare and disease often claimed young men before they became fathers; childhood mortality sometimes carried off any sons they did have. In such cases, a brother, son, or nephew might marry in their name – ‘kindling the fire of the dead’. As in any marriage, cattle were paid as bridewealth to the bride’s family. The difference was that children born of the union would legally belong to the ghost, carry his name, inherit any cattle he had had while living, and, when grown, assume the ritual privileges appropriate to their ghost father.\n\nThis arrangement could lead to a curious cycle. Because the man marrying on behalf of the ghost gained a wife and children in all but name, the family’s cattle would be used next to secure marriages for his younger brothers. In some cases, the living husband died before ever contracting a legal marriage for himself. And so, in turn, his kinsmen found him a wife after death. Ghost marriage begat ghost marriage.\n\nThe Nuer example presents just one of a wide variety of marriage customs. For much of history, this complexity was invisible to Westerners. Northwestern Europeans assumed that their way of doing things, lifelong monogamous marriage sanctified by religion and nuclear families with male breadwinners, was the natural order. But by the twentieth century, anthropologists were returning with reports of foreign customs which challenged this notion.\n\nMargaret Mead’s 1928 book Coming of Age in Samoa depicted a society that regarded ‘lovemaking as the pastime par excellence’ and where young women aimed to ‘defer marriage through as many years of casual love-making as possible’. At the same time Bronislaw Malinowski’s 1929 The Sexual Life of Savages in North-Western Melanesia described trial marriage among the Trobriand Islanders, where young lovers would live together for a few years in the bukumatula – the bachelors’ and unmarried girls’ house. If this relationship went well, it would lead to marriage, but it could also easily be dissolved. In other words, it resembled modern dating.\n\nGeorge Murdock and Douglas R White went on to formalize this scholarship with the publication of the Ethnographic Atlas in 1967, a compilation of over 1,200 cultures. Two years later, they refined the project into the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample, selecting 186 societies thought to be culturally independent and geographically dispersed. Of these societies, 31 were monogamous, 153 were polygynous, where a man had multiple wives, and 2 were polyandrous, where a woman had multiple husbands.\n\nOne thing became abundantly clear: most people in the world don’t and have never lived like Europeans. Sometimes marriage is sanctified by religion or the state; other times, it is simply what happens when two people begin living together. For some it is chosen, while for others it is coerced. Some societies prize monogamy, others polygamy, yet neither is a clear predictor of fidelity. In some cultures, both sexes can divorce and remarry freely; in others, only men have that right.\n\nCompared to the rest of the animal kingdom, human marriage is even more aberrant. We are among a minority of animals where individuals pair up over long periods of time. Birds pair bond like us, but only nine percent of mammalian species do. For most animals, relationships last only as long as the duration of copulation.\n\nBut we are yet more peculiar. We are the only animal where third parties – parents, siblings, and extended family – routinely interfere in marital decisions, often going to great lengths to shape, delay, or prevent unions. Some societies arrange marriages at birth or very young ages. Many require long negotiations through family-approved channels. Others segregate boys and girls to restrict contact.\n\nWell known is the segregation of women, such as the South Asian practice of purdah (literally ‘curtain’ or ‘veil’), a system that ranges from modest dress to near-complete seclusion. Lesser known is the segregation of men. Among the Enga of Papua New Guinea, boys as young as six were sent to live in men’s houses, eventually joining bachelor cults that taught them discipline and allowed marriage only after they had proven themselves. Only virgins could take part in the final initiation ritual, which involved lying open-eyed beneath a waterfall to cleanse themselves of the pollution caused by having seen a woman’s genitals. Nearby, teasing girls would sing: ‘I urinated further up this creek. Where did you purify your eyes?’\n\nWhether through teasing, teaching or coercion, it is clear that marriage is rarely a private matter. It holds deep significance for the wider family and community. Time and time again it serves the same basic purpose: managing resources and building alliances. So why do strategies vary so widely?\n\nFor evolutionary anthropologists, the answer lies with Charles Darwin. People seek to maximize the number of descendants they leave behind. The best way to do this changes with the environment. And often, the best thing for me may not be the best thing for you. This creates the conditions for the conflicts that occur between the sexes, within families, and between competing groups.\n\nFor around 280,000 years, roughly 95 percent of our history as Homo sapiens, we lived as hunter-gatherers. Today, a few such groups still exist, although these final echoes of a life we lived for millennia will soon disappear as well.\n\nThe BaYaka, who live deep in the Congolese rainforest, are one of these. Anthropologist Haneul Jang, who has worked with the BaYaka for over a decade, describes how marriages happen: an enamored adolescent couple will simply walk off into the forest and a few days later, they return and build a hut. There is no ceremony, no exchanging of vows, just a mutual understanding that they are now together. ‘There is something very romantic about it’, she says.\n\nThe young man may then do ‘bride service’, where he will live with his girlfriend’s family for a year, hunting and collecting honey with his father-in-law. At some point the relationship may dissolve. This can even happen while the couple still have small children. It will end much like it began, with one individual wandering off into the forest and building a hut with someone else.\n\nThis fluidity isn’t unique to the BaYaka but a product of hunter-gatherer societies. Groups are highly mobile, society is egalitarian – any meat from hunts is quickly shared – and there is an almost total absence of material wealth. Fathers look after their children, but they are not necessarily a primary carer. A review of over 45 studies, mostly looking at populations without medical fertility control, found that fathers have a surprisingly small effect on child survival. Other helpers, predominantly grandmothers and siblings, provide more substantial support for the mother.\n\nWhile Murdock’s Ethnographic Atlas classifies most hunter-gatherers as polygynous, this is not accurate. In practice, most men are unable to support more than one wife because there is no stored wealth. Divorce and remarriage happen frequently because helpful extended families give women certainty that they won’t be left raising children alone. The lack of inheritance prevents conflict developing over having children with multiple partners, and the residential mobility means one can literally just walk away from relationships one no longer wants to be in. Consequently, women will frequently have children with two or even three men during their lifetime.\n\nWhen farming arrived 12,000 years ago it transformed almost everything, including marriage. Defending livestock and crops became a priority, mobility decreased, and for the first time in history, wealth could be accumulated, leading to the emergence of inequality.\n\nIn the arid regions of northern Kenya, several pastoral groups still roam with herds of cattle or camels. In 1948, one Turkana man named Imana had 13 children by four wives, all of whom he was married to concurrently. His herd of over a hundred cows made it possible to support multiple households. By contrast, his neighbor, with only ten cows, had to come to terms with a single wife and far fewer children.\n\nIt’s easy to see how the arrival of wealth reshaped marriage: more cows, more wives. But less obvious is that this shift may also have been shaped by female choice. Individual men always stand to benefit, in Darwinian terms, from gaining extra wives, since they have no reproductive upper limit. Women, however, do. They have a choice: be the second or third wife of a rich pastoralist or be the first wife of a poor one. It can pay to be the former.\n\nTaken to its extremes, some men may be so powerful and rich that they can accumulate tens, if not hundreds, of wives. The Azande recount tales of one legendary monarch, Gbudwe, who once spotted an attractive girl as he was walking through his province. Wanting her to be his wife, he stopped to inquire who she was and was told that she was one of his own wives.\n\nOf course, given the benefits to men, not all polygyny is freely chosen. Among the Dogon of Mali child mortality is higher in polygynous households, suggesting women may be coerced into these marriages. But elsewhere, such as in Northern Tanzania, the children of polygynous fathers tend to be wealthier and better nourished.\n\nWhen some men have many wives, women become a limited resource for which men must compete. Daughters become economically valuable to parents, who can demand a bride price, ranging from a couple of cows to a small fortune. To raise the funds, some men must call upon extended family networks and make the payments over several years. Among the Chagga of Tanzania during the colonial period, efforts were made to standardize bride wealth payments: 62 pots of beer, 4 slaughtered goats, 3 live goats, 15 gourds of milk, and half a cow. And that was just the pre-wedding deposit. After the wedding came a cascade of further obligations: heifers and goats to the father of the bride, and still more livestock and beer for her mother, uncles, grandmother, and brothers. To avoid disputes between sons, fathers would sometimes allocate each a sister, whose bridewealth could be used to finance his marriage.\n\nThe second consequence of polygyny is that wealth flows overwhelmingly to sons. Sons can use inherited wealth to acquire more wives and therefore many more descendants. Daughters can only carry so many children. So, across Africa, whenever cows were adopted so was polygyny and societies ended up passing property down the male line, as patrilineal families started to outnumber matrilineal ones.\n\nIn these marriage systems, divorce and remarriage become less frequent, as parents have to return the bride price, and when children inherit, fathers have a vested interest in ensuring they are his. These societies invent ways to limit the freedom of women. The Dogon of Mali, for example, have menstrual huts where women must seclude themselves during their menses. This advertisement of her cycle helps men to protect themselves from being cuckolded. He, along with the rest of the community, will know when she is fertile and so if she falls pregnant without him visiting her he knows the baby isn’t his. This system appears to work. Among the Dogon three religions coexist: Christianity, Islam, and the indigenous Dogon faith, which requires use of the menstrual hut. Genetic data from fathers and sons of the Dogon of Mali found that nonpaternity (a child not being genetically the offspring of their father), though uncommon, was slightly lower when mothers used the hut than when they did not, and that there were higher rates among Christians, whose women are not obliged to signal menstruation. Among Muslims, nonpaternity was no higher than among adherents of the Dogon religion since women must still declare menstruation and refrain from prayer, an equivalent signal of fertile periods.\n\nThese controls apply to both married and unmarried women. Unmarried Dogon girls must also use the menstrual huts, reducing the chance of unwittingly marrying an already pregnant woman, while socializing girls into institutions of control from a young age.\n\nParents can also command a higher bride price for daughters seen as compliant and chaste. Some scholars have suggested that female genital cutting, widespread in Sub-Saharan Africa, functions as a signal of virginity, allowing parents to secure better marriage terms. The evidence is mixed: cut girls do not consistently receive higher bride prices. But they are less likely than uncut peers to report more than one lifetime sexual partner, suggesting the practice does control their sexual freedom.\n\nThe usual pattern is that pastoralists are inegalitarian, inequality drives polygyny, and polygyny drives male control of women. But there are exceptions. Known for their distinctive hair coated in a paste of fat and red ochre, the Himba of Namibia are pastoralists among whom polygyny is common. Yet they are relaxed about infidelity, and many women have boyfriends outside of wedlock. In one sample the child was not biologically the husband’s in 49 percent of cases. There is no cuckoldry, and the Himba know exactly whose children are whose. But her husband helps raise them and pays for their marriages. He doesn’t seem to mind, knowing that the same behavior is the rule in the households where he has fathered children. Men expect their wives to see their boyfriends when they are away but not to flaunt it in front of them. ‘It’s when he stays for tea in the morning, that is when it really upsets me’, described one Himba man.\n\nWhat makes the Himba so different? For one, the bride price is considerably smaller than in other pastoralist groups: typically only one or two cows and some goats. Second, most inheritance passes matrilineally, from a man to his sister’s sons. That blood line is guaranteed: he knows he and his sister share a mother and that her child is truly hers. These two features – a modest investment in non-biological children and the assurance of relatedness through the female line – help men to accept high levels of nonpaternity within their marriages.\n\nNor is polygyny confined to Africa. When Islam emerged in the seventh century, Quranic law sought to cap men at four wives, a limit that suggests the practice was widespread, at least for elites who could afford it. Today, the same logic plays out under different currencies. In Papua New Guinea men with a bik nem, literally a ‘big name’, once used pigs and shells to secure multiple wives. But with the rise of mineral extraction, wealth has shifted. Today it is the dak glas kar men (men with dark glasses and cars) who attract multiple women. As with the pastoralists, sometimes it pays to be the second wife of a rich man than the first of a poor one.\n\nSo how does one explain the parts of the world, like Europe and large parts of Asia, that are unequal yet predominantly monogamous? The spread of monogamy is often credited to Christianity, but restrictions on polygyny long predate it. The code of Hammurabi (1750 BC) let Babylonian men take a second wife only in rare cases, such as when the first wife was infertile. In ancient Greece and Rome, monogamous marriage was the only legally recognized union.\n\nBut even though Roman men were expected to have one wife, they often kept mistresses and fathered many children by their slaves. Similarly, Confucian family law recognized one principal wife for lineage and ritual, but allowed for concubines. Together, these exceptions to the monogamous rule may help explain why anthropological evidence finds that monogamous and polygynous societies have similar variations in male reproductive success.\n\nThe fact that many ‘monogamous’ cultures allow for elite men to have concubines and mistresses highlights the difference between a ‘mating system’ and a ‘marriage system’. Marriage might be more about managing resources than who you have sex with. Monogamous systems, therefore, may have evolved to limit the transfer of resources, rather than as a form of monogamous mating.\n\nIn this explanation, men forgo their right to multiple wives when the whole is more than the sum of its parts, and dividing their wealth among many heirs would reduce its total value. You see this clearly with farming, where dividing land into smaller plots reduces its productivity compared to keeping it as a single estate, a problem that doesn’t occur when dividing a herd of animals. This issue becomes especially acute once there is no new fertile land to expand into – a situation that occurred across Europe in the Middle Ages. This might explain the rise of unigeniture, where only one son inherits.\n\nUnder such an all eggs in one basket strategy, a man needed to be sure this son was his. So women traded their faithfulness in exchange for an agreement that only their children were legitimate heirs. Virginity was prized, and divorce could become almost impossible. Across the world, where paternal investment is higher, so too is sexual jealousy.\n\nWhile women’s sexuality was strictly controlled, men were not faithful, and many would father children out of wedlock. But legislative and institutional systems were built up to exclude these bastard children. Unlike polygyny, where women were the limited resource, under inegalitarian monogamy rich men were. Daughters went from being an asset to a cost as parents had to endow them with large dowries to compete for the few inheriting men.\n\nNevertheless, many of these societies ended up with partible inheritance while still remaining monogamous. After the French Revolution, the government imposed the equal partition of assets among children. Unable to choose just one heir and faced with the over-division of assets, families limited the number of children they had, possibly helping explain why France was the first European country to exhibit declining fertility rates. The same trend has been found in Sub-Saharan Africa. Individuals from ethnic groups where inheritance is shared between all children have lower fertility rates than those from ethnic groups where a single heir is chosen.\n\nNorms are sticky and can become separated from the underlying factor that caused them to originally evolve. Similarly, once evolved, the behavior can take on new functions. Limiting inheritance to the children of one woman is beneficial to that woman, and she has a vested interest in maintaining monogamy beyond a world of large agricultural estates. On the other hand, disinherited children are disadvantaged under such a system and might undermine it as they become more numerous.\n\nIn contemporary Western settings, things seem to have changed once again. Many people are monogamous and have children with a single partner, much like our agricultural forbearers. But others divorce and remarry, similar to hunter-gatherers. Young couples often live together before deciding whether to commit, like the trial marriages of the Samoans. True polygamy is usually illegal, yet some rich divorced or widowed men can attract young second wives, who can bear them a new set of children. Ethical non-monogamists are a growing and vocal minority. To an outsider, it may seem like we have no marriage system at all.\n\nTraditional controls over marriage have weakened. Couples now choose for themselves, usually for love. The disappearance of bridewealth, dowries, and kin-arranged unions has reduced family involvement. While this might feel like a long steady transition for the West, it’s unfolding rapidly in many parts of the world today.\n\nAs states expand schooling, boys and girls mix freely. Mobile phones let them talk privately. Rural-to-urban migration brings people from different ethnic groups together, and when they marry, neither tradition quite applies. Removing the involvement of third parties makes marriages easier to enter and leave. One woman from the El Molo, a small fishing community on the shores of Lake Turkana in Kenya put it bluntly: ‘in my time, your husband could beat you badly and you would stay. Today, the smallest thing, and they divorce’.\n\nIronically, Christian missionaries may have had similar effects. In Melanesia they tried to ban bachelor cults and introduced mixed churches. They preached chastity, while also inadvertently undermining the indigenous systems that had once regulated informal relationships.\n\nLess obvious is how changes to wealth and inheritance might also make marriage more fluid. In contemporary Western societies, unigeniture is either considered wrong or is illegal; we no longer differentiate between legitimate and illegitimate offspring; and children inherit from both parents. Women no longer need to ‘trade’ their fidelity for economic security, and men may well be less territorial (cuckoldry rates range between one and three percent in the West). With women fully integrated into the workforce and earning similar salaries to their husbands, there is little keeping them in relationships they do not enjoy. And fathers who wish to divorce assume that the mothers of their children will be fine raising children alone with the support of their family, the state, and their salaries.\n\nThere has always been a tension between the stability of marriage and the freedom of individuals. This is an important reason why divorce rates drop as soon as couples have children and part of why they remain lower among higher socioeconomic groups. In a social milieu where buying a home requires two incomes and raising children has become increasingly expensive, requiring support and education well into their twenties, a complementarity of roles emerges. If you have little chance of buying a home and fewer payoffs to investing in the education of your children, then it is easier to walk away.\n\nThe tradeoffs between one or many partners, a single or multiple heirs, control or freedom, have shaped marriage for as long as humans have existed. These tugs of war explain the vast variety of relationships we see around the world. Marriage is not fixed but a tool to build connections, secure wealth, and ultimately to pass on genes. If marriage has a nature, it is to be reshaped to fit the world around it. In a world where many of the familiar constraints have disappeared, perhaps all that is keeping us together is love.",

    "fullText": "Kanagawa, Japan - Sigma Corporation (Headquarters: Kawasaki-shi, Kanagawa, CEO: Kazuto Yamaki) is pleased to announce that it will establish Sigma Aizu Farm Corporation on April 1, 2026 (planned) and begin agricultural initiatives centered on rice cultivation in the Aizu region. As a company that has been long supported by the nature and people of Aizu, Sigma aims to further clarify its commitment to regional contribution and to a manufacturing philosophy that coexists in harmony with the natural environment.\n\nSigma's Aizu factory has served for many years as the company's sole production site, supported by local communities and Aizu's rich natural surroundings. The skills and spirit cultivated here have shaped Sigma's quality and remain the driving force behind delivering \"Made in Aizu, Japan\" products to customers worldwide.\n\nAt the same time, Aizu―like many regions across Japan―faces growing challenges, including a shortage of agricultural successors and an increase in abandoned farmland. As a result, satoyama landscapes, ecosystems, and local cultural heritage are gradually being lost, beginning with rice paddies that have long retained abundant water and supported the region's natural cycles. In response to these changes, Sigma believes that protecting the natural environment and supporting local livelihoods is an important responsibility for a company that continues to manufacture in this region. Starting rice cultivation through Sigma Aizu Farm is a concrete initiative aimed at sustaining Aizu's culture, landscapes, and ways of life for the future by maintaining and cultivating rice paddies and farmland.\n\nThrough the Sigma Aizu Farm initiative, Sigma focuses on cultivating rice, blessed by the water and soil of Mt. Bandai. The harvested produce is planned to be served in the employee cafeterias at Sigma's Aizu factory and its headquarters in Kawasaki. By shifting from a position of simply receiving the blessings of the land to one of directly giving back to the region, Sigma embarks on a new chapter―contributing to the preservation of the local environment and culture through rice cultivation, while also helping to create traditional and stable employment in the Aizu region.\n\nFuture updates and details regarding this initiative will be announced on the following page:\n\nhttps://www.sigma-global.com/en/sigma-aizu-farm/\n\nFor further details on Sigma's environmental initiatives, visit:\n\nhttps://www.sigma-global.com/en/sustainability/\n\nMADE IN AIZU, JAPAN\n\n\"The Art of engineering.

    "description": "DJI may have fixed it now.",
    "fullText": "The immediate threat may be fixed, but this raises serious questions.\n\nThe immediate threat may be fixed, but this raises serious questions.\n\nSammy Azdoufal claims he wasn’t trying to hack every robot vacuum in the world. He just wanted to remote control his brand-new DJI Romo vacuum with a PS5 gamepad, he tells The Verge, because it sounded fun.\n\nBut when his homegrown remote control app started talking to DJI’s servers, it wasn’t just one vacuum cleaner that replied. Roughly 7,000 of them, all around the world, began treating Azdoufal like their boss.\n\nHe could remotely control them, and look and listen through their live camera feeds, he tells me, saying he tested that out with a friend. He could watch them map out each room of a house, generating a complete 2D floor plan. He could use any robot’s IP address to find its rough location.\n\n“I found my device was just one in an ocean of devices,” he says.\n\nOn Tuesday, when he showed me his level of access in a live demo, I couldn’t believe my eyes. Ten, hundreds, thousands of robots reporting for duty, each phoning home MQTT data packets every three seconds to say: their serial number, which rooms they’re cleaning, what they’ve seen, how far they’ve traveled, when they’re returning to the charger, and the obstacles they encountered along the way.\n\nI watched each of these robots slowly pop into existence on a map of the world. Nine minutes after we began, Azdoufal’s laptop had already cataloged 6,700 DJI devices across 24 different countries and collected over 100,000 of their messages. If you add the company’s DJI Power portable power stations, which also phone home to these same servers, Azdoufal had access to over 10,000 devices.\n\nWhen I say I couldn’t believe my eyes at first, I mean that literally. Azdoufal leads AI strategy at a vacation rental home company; when he told me he reverse engineered DJI’s protocols using Claude Code, I had to wonder whether AI was hallucinating these robots. So I asked my colleague Thomas Ricker, who just finished reviewing the DJI Romo, to pass us its serial number.\n\nWith nothing more than that 14-digit number, Azdoufal could not only pull up our robot, he could correctly see it was cleaning the living room and had 80 percent battery life remaining. Within minutes, I watched the robot generate and transmit an accurate floor plan of my colleague’s house, with the correct shape and size of each room, just by typing some digits into a laptop located in a different country.\n\nSeparately, Azdoufal pulled up his own DJI Romo’s live video feed, completely bypassing its security PIN, then walked into his living room and waved to the camera while I watched. He also says he shared a limited read-only version of his app with Gonzague Dambricourt, CTO at an IT consulting firm in France; Dambricourt tells me the app let him remotely watch his own DJI Romo’s camera feed before he even paired it.\n\nAzdoufal was able to enable all of this without hacking into DJI’s servers, he claims. “I didn’t infringe any rules, I didn’t bypass, I didn’t crack, brute force, whatever.” He says he simply extracted his own DJI Romo’s private token — the key that tells DJI’s servers that you should have access to your own data — and those servers gave him the data of thousands of other people as well. He shows me that he can access DJI’s pre-production server, as well as the live servers for the US, China, and the EU. (He says his tool wipes the data each time he closes it.)\n\nHere’s the good news: On Tuesday, Azdoufal was not able to take our DJI Romo on a joyride through my colleague’s house, see through its camera, or listen through its microphone. DJI had already restricted that form of access after both Azdoufal and I told the company about the vulnerabilities.\n\nAnd by Wednesday morning, Azdoufal’s scanner no longer had access to any robots, not even his own. It appears that DJI has plugged the gaping hole.\n\nBut this incident raises serious questions about DJI’s security and data practices. It will no doubt be used to help retroactively justify fears that led to the Chinese dronemaker getting largely forced out of the US. If Azdoufal could find these robots without even looking for them, will it protect them against people with intent to do harm? If Claude Code can spit out an app that lets you see into someone’s house, what keeps a DJI employee from doing so? And should a robot vacuum cleaner have a microphone? “It’s so weird to have a microphone on a freaking vacuum,” says Azdoufal.\n\nIt doesn’t help that when Azdoufal and The Verge contacted DJI about the issue, the company claimed it had fixed the vulnerability when it was actually only partially resolved.\n\n“DJI can confirm the issue was resolved last week and remediation was already underway prior to public disclosure,” reads part of the original statement provided by DJI spokesperson Daisy Kong. We received that statement on Tuesday morning at 12:28PM ET — about half an hour before Azdoufal showed me thousands of robots, including our review unit, reporting for duty.\n\nTo be clear, it’s not surprising that a robot vacuum cleaner with a smartphone app would phone home to the cloud. For better or for worse, users currently expect those apps to work outside of their own homes. Unless you’ve built a tunnel into your own home network, that means relaying the data through cloud servers first.\n\nBut people who put a camera into their home expect that data to be protected, both in transit and once it reaches the server. Security professionals should know that — but as soon as Azdoufal connected to DJI’s MQTT servers, everything was visible in cleartext. If DJI has merely cut off one particular way into those servers, that may not be enough to protect them if hackers find another way in.\n\nUnfortunately, DJI is far from the only smart home company that’s let people down on security. Hackers took over Ecovacs robot vacuums to chase pets and yell racist slurs in 2024. In 2025, South Korean government agencies reported that Dreame’s X50 Ultra had a flaw that could let hackers view its camera feed in real time, and that another Ecovacs and a Narwal robovac could let hackers view and steal photos from the devices. (Korea’s own Samsung and LG vacuums received high marks, and a Roborock did fine.)\n\nIt’s not just vacuums, of course. I still won’t buy a Wyze camera, despite its new security ideas, because that company tried to sweep a remote access vulnerability under the rug instead of warning its customers. I would find it hard to trust Anker’s Eufy after it lied to us about its security, too. But Anker came clean, and sunlight is a good disinfectant.\n\nDJI is not being exceptionally transparent about what happened here, but it did answer almost all our questions. In a new statement to The Verge via spokesperson Daisy Kong, the company now admits “a backend permission validation issue” that could have theoretically let hackers see live video from its vacuums, and it admits that it didn’t fully patch that issue until after we confirmed that issues were still present.\n\nDJI identified a vulnerability affecting DJI Home through internal review in late January and initiated remediation immediately. The issue was addressed through two updates, with an initial patch deployed on February 8 and a follow-up update completed on February 10. The fix was deployed automatically, and no user action is required.\n\nThe vulnerability involved a backend permission validation issue affecting MQTT-based communication between the device and the server. While this issue created a theoretical potential for unauthorized access to live video of ROMO device, our investigation confirms that actual occurrences were extremely rare. Nearly all identified activity was linked to independent security researchers testing their own devices for reporting purposes, with only a handful of potential exceptions.\n\nThe first patch addressed this vulnerability but had not been applied universally across all service nodes. The second patch re-enabled and restarted the remaining service nodes. This has now been fully resolved, and there is no evidence of broader impact. This was not a transmission encryption issue. ROMO device-to-server communication was not transmitted in cleartext and has always been encrypted using TLS. Data associated with ROMO devices, such as those in Europe, is stored on U.S.-based AWS cloud infrastructure.\n\nDJI maintains strong standards for data privacy and security and has established processes for identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities. The company has invested in industry-standard encryption and operates a longstanding bug bounty program. We have reviewed the findings and recommendations shared by the independent security researchers who contacted us through that program as part of our standard post-remediation process. DJI will continue to implement additional security enhancements as part of its ongoing efforts.\n\nAzdoufal says that even now, DJI hasn’t fixed all the vulnerabilities he’s found. One of them is the ability to view your own DJI Romo video stream without needing its security pin. Another one is so bad I won’t describe it until DJI has more time to fix it. As of February 17th, DJI tells The Verge it will do so within weeks.\n\nAnd both Azdoufal and security researcher Kevin Finisterre tell me it’s not enough for the Romo to send encrypted data to a US server, if anyone inside that server can easily read it afterward. “A server being based in the US in no way, shape, or form prevents .cn DJI employees from access,” Finisterre tells me. That seems evident, as Azdoufal lives in Barcelona and was able to see devices in entirely different regions.\n\n“Once you’re an authenticated client on the MQTT broker, if there are no proper topic-level access controls (ACLs), you can g., #) and see all messages from all devices in plaintext at the application layer,” says Azdoufal. “TLS does nothing to prevent this — it only protects the pipe, not what’s inside the pipe from other authorized participants.”\n\nWhen I tell Azdoufal that some may judge him for not giving DJI much time to resolve the issues before going public, he notes that he didn’t hack anything, didn’t expose sensitive data, and isn’t a security professional. He says he was simply livetweeting everything that happened while trying to control his robot with a PS5 gamepad.\n\n“Yes, I don’t follow the rules, but people stick to the bug bounty program for money. I fucking don’t care, I just want this fixed,” he says. “Following the rules to the end would probably make this breach happen for a way longer time, I think.”\n\nHe doesn’t believe that DJI truly discovered these issues by itself back in January, and he’s annoyed the company only ever responded to him robotically in DMs on X, instead of answering his emails.\n\nBut he is happy about one thing: He can indeed control his Romo with a PlayStation or Xbox gamepad.\n\nUpdate, February 17th: Added that DJI has committed to address the other vulnerability within a matter of weeks.",

    "fullText": "The breathing light – officially “Sleep Indicator Light” – debuted in the iconic iBook G3 in 1999.\n\nIt was originally placed in the hinge, but soon was moved to the other side for laptops, and eventually put in desktop computers too: Power Mac, the Cube, and the iMac.\n\nThe green LED was replaced by a white one, but “pulsating light indicates that the computer is sleeping” buried the nicest part of it – the animation was designed to mimic human breathing at 12 breaths per minute, and feel comforting and soothing:\n\nLiving through that era, it was interesting to see improvements to this small detail.\n\nThe iMac G5 gained a light sensor under the edge of the display in part so that the sleep indicator light wouldn’t be too bright in a dark room (and for older iMacs, the light would just get dimmer during the night based on the internal clock).\n\nIn later MacBooks, the light didn’t even have an opening. The aluminum was thinned and perforated so it felt like the sleep light was shining through the metal:\n\nAnd, for a while, Apple promoted their own display connector that bundled data and power – but also bundled a bit of data, which allowed to do this:\n\nBack when I had a Powermac G4 plugged into an Apple Cinema Display, I noticed something that was never advertised. When the Mac went to sleep, the pulsing sleep light came on, of course, but the sleep light on the display did too... in sync with the light on the Mac. I’ve tested that so many times, and it was always the same; in sync.\n\nJust a little detail that wouldn’t sell anything, but just because.\n\nEven years later, some people tried to recreate it on their own:\n\nTo do this I shifted the first gaussian curve to that its domain starts at 0 and remains positive. Since the time domain is 5 seconds total and the I:E ratio is known, it was trivial to pick the split point and therefore the mean. By manipulating sigma I was able to get the desired up-take and fall-off curves; by manipulating factor “c” I was able to control for peak intensity.\n\nBut at that point, in the first half of 2010s, the breathing light was gone, victim to the same forces that removed the battery indicator and the illuminated logo on the lid.\n\nI know each person would find themselves elsewhere on the line from “the light was overkill to begin with” to “I wished to see what they would do after they introduced that invisible metal variant.”\n\nI know where I would place myself.\n\nThis blog is all about celebrating functional and meaningful details, and there were practical reasons for the light to be there. This was in the era where laptops often died in their sleep – so knowing your computer was actually sleeping safe and sound was important – and the first appearance of the light after closing the lid meant that the hard drives were parked and the laptop could be moved safely.\n\nThe breathing itself, however, was purely a humanistic touch, and I miss that quirkiness of this little feature. If a save icon can survive, surely so could the breathing light.",

    "description": "The economics of COBOL modernization have shifted. AI makes the economics work by automating what used to require armies of consultants.",
    "fullText": "Legacy code modernization stalled for years because understanding legacy code cost more than rewriting it. AI flips that equation.\n\nCOBOL is everywhere. It handles an estimated 95% of ATM transactions in the US. Hundreds of billions of lines of COBOL run in production every day, powering critical systems in finance, airlines, and government.\n\nDespite that, the number of people who understand it shrinks every year.\n\nThe developers who built these systems retired years ago, and the institutional knowledge they carried left with them. Production code has been modified repeatedly over decades, but the documentation hasn't kept up. Meanwhile, we aren't exactly minting replacements—COBOL is taught at only a handful of universities, and finding engineers who can read it gets harder every quarter.\n\nGiven these roadblocks, how can organizations modernize their systems without losing the reliability, availability, and data they’ve accumulated over decades? And without breaking anything?\n\nCOBOL modernization differs fundamentally from typical legacy code refactoring. You aren’t just updating familiar code to use better patterns, you’re reverse engineering business logic from systems built when Nixon was president. You’re untangling dependencies that evolved over decades, and translating institutional knowledge that now exists only in the code itself.\n\nModernizing a COBOL system once required armies of consultants spending years mapping workflows. This resulted in large timelines and high costs that few were willing to take on.\n\nTools like Claude Code can automate the exploration and analysis phases that consume most of the effort in COBOL modernization. These tools can:\n\nWith AI, teams can modernize their COBOL codebase in quarters instead of years.\n\nAI excels at streamlining the tasks that once made COBOL modernization cost-prohibitive. With it, your team can focus on strategy, risk assessment, and business logic while AI automates the code analysis and implementation.\n\nAI starts by reading your entire COBOL codebase and mapping the structure.\n\nIt identifies program entry points, traces execution paths through called subroutines, maps data flows between modules, and documents dependencies that span hundreds of files.\n\nThis kind of mapping goes beyond simple call graphs. Shared data structures, file operations that create coupling between modules, initialization sequences that affect runtime behavior—these implicit dependencies don't show up in static analysis because they involve data shared through files, databases, or global state. They're also exactly what makes COBOL modernization risky, which is why automated discovery matters: it finds these hidden relationships before they cause problems during migration.\n\nWorkflow documentation also emerges out of this analysis.\n\nWith the codebase mapped, AI can assess which components are safe to move and which need careful handling. Modules with high coupling can be more risky to modernize. Isolated components surface as candidates for early, independent modernization. Duplicated logic points to refactoring opportunities. Areas with accumulated technical debt get documented before they become migration surprises.\n\nThis is where human judgment becomes essential. Your COBOL engineers bring the understanding of regulatory requirements, business priorities, operational constraints, and risk tolerance that AI cannot.\n\nThe planning phase develops a detailed roadmap that sequences modernization work strategically:\n\nCode testing and validation are also defined before any code changes:\n\nExecution happens one component at a time, with validation at each step. AI translates COBOL logic into modern languages, creates API wrappers around legacy components that stay in place, and builds the scaffolding to run old and new code side by side during transition.\n\nEach step either succeeds and gets validated, or fails and gets corrected while the scope is small.\n\nYou never have massive changes in flight where failure means rolling back weeks of work. As your team sees modernized components passing tests, they gain confidence to tackle progressively more complex parts of the system.\n\nThe approach outlined above works for COBOL systems of any size.\n\nTools like Claude Code can automate much of the exploration and analysis work described, giving your team the comprehensive understanding they need to plan and execute migrations confidently.\n\nStart with a single component or workflow that has clear boundaries and moderate complexity. Use AI to analyze and document it thoroughly, plan the modernization with your engineers, implement incrementally with testing at each step, and validate carefully.  This will build organizational confidence and surface adjustments needed for your systems.\n\nThe economics of COBOL modernization have shifted. AI makes the economics work by automating what used to require armies of consultants, freeing your engineers to make the migration decisions that require their domain expertise.\n\nFor a step-by-step guide, see the Code Modernization Playbook.\n\nProduct updates, how-tos, community spotlights, and more.

    "description": "Every AI founder I talk to is on an accelerating treadmill, burdened by a nagging suspicion that the entire industry is moving too fast in a direction that doesn't quite make sense, with no idea about how to get off.",
    "fullText": "Every AI founder I talk to is on an accelerating treadmill, burdened by a nagging suspicion that the entire industry is moving too fast in a direction that doesn't quite make sense, with no idea about how to get off.\n\nThere is an overwhelming feeling that if everyone stopped and thought about it for five minutes, they'd build something completely different; but it's paired with a total inability to articulate why they specifically haven't stopped.\n\nNobody stops, because nobody can afford to, and that feeling has a name. It's called Moloch, and it's the most important thing happening in AI that isn't on your roadmap.\n\nA new model drops. It's better at benchmarks. Every AI product company now has to integrate it (if they're a wrapper) or match it (if they're building a model) or explain to their investors why they didn't. Integration // parity takes engineering time, time that doesn't go toward the actual product differentiation that would create long-term value. But the company that doesn't integrate looks like it's falling behind, and looking like you're falling behind is fatal when your entire valuation rests on the assumption that you're on the frontier.\n\nEveryone catches up, everyone shifts resources, everyone ships the update. The net competitive position of every company is exactly where it was before, except they all engineering time on esoteria and none of them made their end-product meaningfully better for end-users.\n\nIt happens every few weeks now.\n\nThis is Moloch; and it'scoordination failure as competition. Every company makes an individually rational decision (keep up with the frontier or die) and the aggregate outcome is an industry that's moving incredibly fast in the direction of model capability, and barely at all in the direction of product value.\n\nThe race is real // the destination is fake.\n\nEvery AI product is converging on the same interface: a chat box. Maybe a chat box with some tool use. Maybe a chat box with some RAG. But at bottom, a text input and a text output, differentiated by branding and minor UX choices and which model is running underneath.\n\nThe chat box won because it ships fast, and Moloch rewards speed over design.\n\nBuilding a novel interaction paradigm takes months or years of research, iteration, user testing. During those months, fifteen competitors will ship chat-box wrappers with the latest model and capture the market's attention. Your investors will get nervous. Your board will suggest you \"ship something\" while you figure out the long-term vision. You'll ship the chat box. The long-term vision will die in a Notion doc nobody opens.\n\nEvery company faces this exact choice and picks the same outcome. The competitive structure selects against creativity. The companies that take time to build something new get outrun by the companies that ship the obvious thing fast. And the obvious thing is always the same thing, because the obvious thing is, by definition, the thing that doesn't need original thinking.\n\nMoloch doesn't want you to build something good.\n\nMoloch wants you to build something now.\n\nThe competitive dynamic is bad enough at the product level. At the fundraising level, it's catastrophic.\n\nAI companies are raising at valuations that require them to grow at rates that are only achievable by chasing the broadest possible market with the most generic possible product. A company that raises at a $500M valuation needs to show a path to billions in revenue, which means it can't afford to be a niche tool that does one thing brilliantly for a specific audience. It has to be a platform, horizontal, aimed at enterprise, built for no one in particular.\n\nEvery AI company is building the same enterprise platform with the same features targeting the same buyers, because the fundraising math requires it, because the valuation requires it, because the competitive environment requires raising at that valuation to attract talent, because the talent market requires it.\n\nNobody in this chain chose this outcome. Every individual decision was rational. The aggregate result is an industry producing fifty identical products, none of which solve any specific problem particularly well, all of which are locked in a feature war that generates zero cumulative value.\n\nThe companies that would build something different (smaller, more focused, more opinionated) can't raise the capital to compete. The companies that raise the capital are structurally forced into sameness. Moloch eats the variance, and variance is where all the actual value lives.\n\nTop AI researchers and engineers go to the companies that are on the frontier. The frontier is defined by model capability benchmarks. So companies invest disproportionately in model capabilty, because that's how you attract talent, even when the marginal return on model capability for their specific product is near zero.\n\nYour users don't need GPT-5 when they can barely use GPT-4 effectively. They need better UX and better integration into how they actually work. But the engineer who could build that wants to work on the model, because model work is what gets you your next job, because the next company is also optimizing for model capability, because they need to attract talent too.\n\nEvery company overspends on model capability and underspends on product quality. The structure forces it. The talent market punishes you for having the right priorities.\n\nThe startup advice I've heard for a decade+ is \"Ignore the noise. Focus on users. Build something good.\"\n\nCorrect in theory, nearly impossible in practice, because Moloch specifically punishes this strategy in the medium term.\n\nBuilding something good takes time, and time means you're not shipping. Not shipping means you look like you're losing, which means talent leaves and investors get nervous, and your competitors (who are shipping fast and bad) capture market position that's expensive to reclaim.\n\nThe window in which \"build something good\" pays off is long, two years, three years, maybe more. The window in which Moloch punishes you for it is immediate and continuous. Most companies don't survive the medium term to reach teh long term.\n\nThe founders who know this stay up at night.\n\nThey can probably see the right thing to build.\n\nThey can't survive building it.\n\nYou can't outrun Moloch. You can only build a structure it can't reach.\n\nIn practice, this means: don't raise more than you need. Don't hire faster than your product vision can absorb. Don't compete on the frontier unless the frontier is where your users live. Find a niche that's too small for the Moloch-captured companies to notice and go so deep into it that by the time they arrive, your product is years ahead in the dimension that matters to those users.\n\nBe small enough that the competitve pressure doesn't distort your priorities. Be opinionated enough that you can't be dragged into building the same thing as everyone else. Be capitally efficient enough that you don't need the growth rate that forces you onto the treadmill. Be weird enough that nobody can copy you without becoming you.",

    "description": "There is no GPS at the Red Planet, but a new technology called Mars Global Localization lets Perseverance determine precisely where it is — without human",
    "fullText": "There is no GPS at the Red Planet, but a new technology called Mars Global Localization lets Perseverance determine precisely where it is — without human help.\n\nImagine you’re all alone, driving along in a rocky, unforgiving desert with no roads, no map, no GPS, and no more than one phone call a day for someone to inform you exactly where you are. That’s what NASA’s Perseverance rover has been experiencing since landing on Mars five years ago. Though it carries time-tested tools for determining its general location, the rover has needed operators on Earth to tell it precisely where it is — until now.\n\nA new technology developed at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California enables Perseverance to figure out its whereabouts without calling humans for help. Dubbed Mars Global Localization, the technology features an algorithm that rapidly compares panoramic images from the rover’s navigation cameras with onboard orbital terrain maps. Running on a powerful processor that Perseverance originally used to communicate with the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter, the algorithm takes about two minutes to pinpoint the rover’s location within some 10 inches (25 centimeters). Mars Global Localization was first used successfully in regular mission operations on Feb. 2, then again Feb. 16.\n\n“This is kind of like giving the rover GPS. Now it can determine its own location on Mars,” said JPL’s Vandi Verma, chief engineer of robotics operations for the mission. “It means the rover will be able to drive for much longer distances autonomously, so we’ll explore more of the planet and get more science. And it could be used by almost any other rover traveling fast and far.”\n\nThe upgrade is especially valuable given how well Perseverance’s auto-navigation self-driving system has been working. Enabling the rover to re-plan its path around obstacles en route to a preestablished destination, AutoNav has proved so capable that the distance Perseverance can drive without instructions from Earth is largely limited by the rover’s uncertainty about its whereabouts. Now that it can stop and determine its exact location, Perseverance can be commanded to drive to potentially unlimited distances without calling home.  Implementation of Mars Global Localization comes on the heels of another innovation from the Perseverance team: the first use of generative artificial intelligence to help plan a drive route by selecting waypoints for the rover, which are normally chosen by human rover operators. Both technologies enable Perseverance to travel farther and faster while minimizing team workload.\n\nUnlike on Earth, there is no network of GPS satellites in deep space to locate spacecraft on planetary surfaces. So missions — whether robotic or crewed — must come up with other ways to determine their location.\n\nAs with NASA’s previous Mars rovers, Perseverance tracks its position using what’s called visual odometry, analyzing geologic features in camera images taken every few feet while accounting for wheel slippage. But as tiny errors in the process add up over the course of each drive, the rover becomes increasingly unsure about its exact location. On long drives, the rover’s sense of its position can be off by more than 100 feet (up to 35 meters). Believing it may be too close to hazardous terrain, Perseverance may prematurely end its drive and wait for instructions from Earth.\n\n“Humans have to tell it, ‘You’re not lost, you’re safe. Keep going,’” Verma said. “We knew if we addressed this problem, the rover could travel much farther every day.”\n\nAfter each drive comes to a halt, the rover sends a 360-degree panorama to Earth, where mapping experts match the imagery with shots from NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). The team then sends the rover its location and instructions for its next drive. That process can take a day or more, but with Mars Global Localization, the rover is able to compare the images itself, determine its location, and roll ahead on its preplanned route.\n\n“We’ve given the rover a new ability,” said Jeremy Nash, a JPL robotics engineer who led the team working on the project under Verma. “This has been an open problem in robotics research for decades, and it’s been super exciting to deploy this solution in space for the first time.”\n\nThe small team began working in 2023, testing the accuracy of the algorithm they’d developed using data from 264 previous rover stops. The algorithm compared rover panoramic photos to MRO imagery and correctly pinpointed the rover’s location for every single stop.\n\nKey to Mars Global Localization is the rover’s Helicopter Base Station (HBS), which Perseverance used to communicate with the now-retired Ingenuity Mars Helicopter. Equipped with a commercial processor that powered many consumer smartphones in the mid-2010s, the HBS runs more than 100 times faster than the rover’s two main computers, which, built to survive the radiation-heavy Martian environment, are based on hardware introduced in 1997.\n\nAs a technology demonstration designed to test capabilities, the Ingenuity mission was able to risk employing more powerful commercial chips in the HBS and the helicopter even though they hadn’t been proven in space. It paid off: Expected to fly no more than five times, the rotorcraft completed 72 flights.\n\nThe power of the HBS processor inspired Verma to look for ways the Perseverance mission might harness it. “It’s almost like a gift. Ingenuity blazed the trail, proving we could use commercial processors on Mars,” Verma said.\n\nTapping into the HBS computer has had its challenges. To address reliability, the team developed a “sanity check”: The algorithm runs on the HBS multiple times before one of the rover’s main computers checks to ensure the results match. During testing, the team repeatedly found the rover’s position was off by 1 millimeter. They discovered damage to about 25 bits — a minuscule fraction of the processor’s 1 gigabyte of memory — and developed a solution to isolate those bits while the algorithm runs.\n\nAlongside the broader Mars Global Localization process, the team’s sanity check and memory solutions are expected to find new uses as faster commercial processors are employed in future missions. In the meantime, the team has already turned their sights to the Moon, where difficult lighting conditions and long, cold lunar nights make knowing exactly where spacecraft are located all the more critical.\n\nNASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is managed for the agency by Caltech, built and manages operations of the Perseverance rover on behalf of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington, as part of NASA’s Mars Exploration Program portfolio.\n\nTo learn more about Perseverance:\n\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-2020-perseverance\n\nMelissa Pamer / DC Agle \nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\n626-314-4928 / 818-393-9011\nmelissa.pamer@jpl.nasa.gov / agle@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nKaren Fox / Molly Wasser\nNASA Headquarters, Washington\n202-358-1600\nkaren.c.fox@nasa.gov / molly.l.wasser@nasa.gov",

I had to RUN to my Mac mini like I was defusing a bomb.\"\n\nYue had given OpenClaw full access to her work inbox and told the agent to \"suggest what you would archive or delete.\" Screenshots she shared showed the agent continuing to \"clear everything\" in her inbox even after she told it to stop.\n\nMusk took a swipe at Yue in a reply to another user on X.\n\n\"Someone who got p0wned by OpenClaw is definitely gonna solve AI safety,\" Musk wrote.\n\nPeter Steinberger, the creator of OpenClaw, also chimed in. He wrote on X in reply to Yue's post: \"/stop does the trick.\"\n\nOpenClaw and its agent-only social platform, Moltbook, went viral earlier this year as developers shared videos of AI agents posting, debating, and networking autonomously.\n\nLast week, OpenAI's Sam Altman announced he had hired Steinberger to work on the \"next generation\" of personal AI agents — an effort he said would \"quickly become core to our product offerings.\"\n\nMusk's comments about OpenClaw come amid his long-running, increasingly heated rivalry with Altman.\n\nLast month, Musk escalated tensions by posting on X: \"Don't let your loved ones use ChatGPT,\" responding to a post that said OpenAI's chatbot had been linked to multiple deaths since its 2022 release.\n\nAltman pushed back, defending ChatGPT and OpenAI's safety efforts before turning his fire on Tesla's Autopilot system, calling it unsafe.\n\nEarlier this month, Altman said in a post on X that he's \"really excited\" to take the fight with Musk into court.\n\n\"Really excited to get Elon under oath in a few months, Christmas in April!\" the OpenAI CEO wrote.\n\nMusk sued OpenAI and Altman in February 2024, accusing the company of abandoning its nonprofit mission.

    "description": "In about a year, Ukraine has turned the interceptor drones from an engineering novelty into a mass-produced foundation of its air defense.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's interceptor drones now account for almost a third of the Russian aerial threats destroyed, a top officer in the country's branch for uncrewed air defenses said.\n\n\"If we take into account the share of interceptor UAVs in the destruction of air targets, we have already reached the mark of 30%,\" said Col. Yuriy Cherevashenka in a video interview published on Monday by Ukraine's air force.\n\n\"That is, every third drone target that is destroyed in Ukraine is destroyed by an interceptor UAV,\" he added.\n\nHis comments signal a milestone in the Ukrainian use of interceptor drones. These are typically small, inexpensive quadcopters optimized to fly fast enough to catch Russian one-way attack drones.\n\nThese air defense drones were an emerging novelty in the earlier years of the war, but Ukraine began accelerating their development in late 2024 as a cost-effective answer to Moscow ramping up its regular drone attacks on Ukrainian cities.\n\nA year later, Ukrainian officials said in December that the country was producing 950 interceptor drones per day.\n\nRussia launches thousands of long-range drones into Ukraine every month, and has been known to sometimes accumulate over 800 of them to attack in a single night. Its most common attack drone is a locally built version of the Iranian Shahed loitering munition.\n\nInterceptor drones are built to destroy these aerial threats by ramming into them or deploying an explosive warhead. Much of a successful interception relies on the skill of the pilot and crew, who must spot the Shahed quickly, approach its trajectory, track its position, and then fly their drone into the Russian device.\n\nNot all interceptors are quadcopters, but many are designed with four propellers and a dome-like frame to reach extreme speeds, since the typical Shahed can reach up to 115 mph, while more advanced versions are estimated to reach 230 mph.\n\nCherevashenka said that Ukrainian officials initially worried about dealing with 350 Shahed attacks a month.\n\nNow, however, it's common for Ukraine to fight 350 Shahed attacks per day, he added.\n\n\"Compared to 2022, when the first drone arrived in September over Kyiv, it had a 40-kilogram warhead and was a primitive drone flying by coordinates,\" the colonel said. \"Now, we have 14 types of warheads for the strike drones of the Russian Federation.\"\n\nCherevashenka further warned that Russia has been incorporating artificial intelligence into its Shaheds and is known to use mesh networks to guide them.\n\nEarlier this year, Ukraine reported that Russian troops were regularly accessing Starlink networks via black market terminals, including to guide Shahed attack drones. The complaints prompted SpaceX to cut connectivity over the war zone and allow access only to terminals on an official Ukrainian whitelist.\n\n\"We understand that this is not the end, that they will increase their capabilities,\" Cherevashenka said of Russia's drone industry. \"Moreover, this year they have invested in the production of twice as many drones as last year.\"\n\nInterceptor drones form just one part of Ukraine's multi-layered air defense network. The country also commonly deploys truck-mounted machine-gun crews to shoot down Shaheds, reserving interceptor munitions for higher priority threats, such as Russian cruise or ballistic missiles.",

    "description": "Alap Shah, coauthor of a viral report that theorizes how AI could trigger a recession by 2028, explains why there may only be \"one labor market.\"",
    "fullText": "The coauthor of an AI research paper is speaking out after his work triggered a global stock sell-off.\n\nCitrini, a firm focused on thematic equity investing, alongside Alap Shah, CEO of Littlebird.ai, theorized a future where, instead of transforming the economy in a positive way, the AI boom erases white-collar jobs and severely reduces the spending power of those workers, and eventually stunts economic growth.\n\nOn Monday, Shah told \"TBPN\" podcast hosts John Coogan and Jordi Hays that despite how well it seems to be going for blue-collar jobs at the moment in terms of growth and the lack of mass layoffs, these jobs won't be safe if white collar jobs go away because ultimately, there is only \"one labor market.\"\n\n\"Let's say in our scenario, we talk about 5% of folks might get fired in a couple of years,\" said Shah. \"Those 5%, if there aren't white collar jobs for them to relocate into, then they're going to have to move into the gig economy and the blue collar labor force.\"\n\n\"And so that puts pressure on the entire labor market, not just the white collar one,\" Shah added.\n\nShah and Citrini published a report on Sunday, written from a futuristic point of view set in 2028, that predicts a negative domino scenario triggered by the AI boom. The research theorizes that AI will kick off a mass white-collar layoff too quickly, which will then deal a blow to the metro housing and mortgage market, and eventually lead to a global stock sell-off and a widespread recession in all sectors. In this scenario, the paper said, AI growth could also lose momentum due to a lack of funding.\n\n\"The system turned out to be one long daisy chain of correlated bets on white-collar productivity growth,\" the paper theorizes. \"The November 2027 crash only served to accelerate all of the negative feedback loops already in place.\"\n\nShah elaborated on these concerns on \"TBPN.\" When asked what he thinks of the current growth in the health and education sectors, Shah said most of it could be spurred by government spending, which would go away if personal income declines.\n\n\"Those sectors continue to grow because government spending grows,\" said Shah. \"But again, gets very circular if government spending is coming primarily from taxes and primarily payroll taxes because the average worker pays a lot",

    "fullText": "Pete Hegseth wants a top Pentagon contractor to know he really, really means it when he demands they abandon their cautious approach to the Defense Department’s AI systems.\n\nThe defense secretary is set to host Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei on Tuesday morning for what Axios reports is “likely to be tense meeting” on the military’s use of the company’s Claude software.\n\n“Anthropic knows this is not a get-to-know-you meeting,” as one defense official described it. “This is not a friendly meeting. This is a s--t-or-get-off-the-pot-meeting.”\n\nAmodei, who’s often warned of AI’s potential for misuse, has consistently pushed to frame his firm as a safety-conscious leader in the sector.\n\nHe has so far resisted pressure from Hegseth to remove safeguards on the Pentagon’s Claude-enabled programs unless the department agrees to wall off mass surveillance of citizens and research into weapons capable of firing without a human operator.\n\nTheir feud is understood to have escalated amid reports that Claude was used by the Pentagon in the Trump administration’s lightning invasion of Venezuela earlier in January.\n\nCritics decried that mission—which secured the capture of President Nicolas Maduro, who now faces narcoterrorism charges in New York federal court—as an all-out assault on the rules-based international order.\n\nAnthropic told Axios that “we are having productive conversations, in good faith,” with the Pentagon.\n\nDefense officials instead say “negotiations have shown no progress,” and are now “on the verge of breaking down.”\n\nEarlier this month, Hegseth warned he would consider certifying Anthropic as a “supply chain risk” if it did not yield to his demands.\n\nOfficials said that at the Tuesday meeting, the secretary now plans on issuing Amodei with an “ultimatum.”\n\n“The problem with Dario is, with him, it’s ideological,” one senior Defense Department source said. “We know who we’re dealing with.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the Defense Department and Anthropic for comment on this story.",

    "fullText": "SALT LAKE CITY (ABC4) — The Mexican army killed the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel on Sunday, prompting what can only be described as a large-scale, violent reaction from cartel members throughout the state of Jalisco. ABC4 spoke with a Utah woman who is staying in Puerto Vallarta and saw first-hand what is transpiring across the region.\n\nThe woman, who has chosen to remain anonymous for her safety, said she has been visiting Puerto Vallarta every winter for the last seven years. She has been there for three weeks on her own, her husband arriving only a few days ago.\n\n“This morning we got ready to walk to the nearby church,” she told ABC4. “I looked outside and saw a huge billowing dark cloud over the bay and wondered if it was a storm cloud or from a fire. I opened the balcony door and immediately knew it was from a fire.”\n\nShe said as she continued to scan the horizon, she saw smoke coming from the north, as well as the south. She ran to the other side of the house, went outside, and saw seven different clouds of smoke coming from various locations.\n\n“That’s when we knew something very intentional was going on,” she said. “We had no idea the cause, we just knew something was very wrong.”\n\nShe added, ““Standing on the balcony and then seeing these fires in the distance and then all of a sudden seeing them pop up literally right in front of me. And I thought, OK, I’m no longer an observer. I am in this.”\n\nWithin 30 minutes, she and her husband heard a serious of loud pops, “like generators exploding,” she said. They soon realized that each pop was a new car bomb going off.\n\nShe said two went off within three blocks of where they were staying.\n\n“We put on our tennis shoes and packed our passports and laptops into backpacks to prepare to leave in a moment’s notice,” she told ABC4. “But because the bombs and fires were going off everywhere in random places, it seemed too dangerous leave.”\n\nThe couple’s friends in Puerto Vallarta, who live in the same building as where they are staying, told them not to leave and to stay indoors. They all gathered together to watch was happening and try to figure out what to do next.\n\n“For about two hours all we did was watch and listen as the various fires started, and then eventually died down,” she said. “Then videos and images started popping up online and we saw people being stopped on the roads and shoved out of their cars and their cars being bombed and set on fire. Then we started hearing stories of people being shot and cars exploding at Costco and the Costco being set on fire.”\n\nShe added that several small stores in the town were also set on fire.\n\n“Truly, the horizon looked like a war zone,” she told ABC4.\n\nBombers were reportedly riding motorcycles, wearing backpacks, and were the only people out on the streets. Every time the group heard a motorcycle outside, they got nervous, she said.\n\n“We started to hear one motorcycle and then heard a loud crash and looked outside, and there was a motorcyclist who crashed right outside our front door,” she said. “His helmet and shoe were across the street and he was clearly injured, but he was wearing a backpack like all of the car bombers, so we didn’t even dare go outside to help him.”\n\nAs time went on, they learned that all of this was an alleged retaliation for the death of cartel leader Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, also known as “El Mencho.” The U.S. Dept. of State told U.S. citizens in the region to shelter in place, and flights going in and out of Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta were canceled.\n\nThe city was put under curfew and the marina was also closed.\n\n“I can still see a few fires smoldering about a mile or two away, but nothing close by,” she told ABC4. “Two big military ships are patrolling the bay and military helicopters are flying very low, likely looking for potential bombers.”\n\nWhile they didn’t see much police presence during the initial bombing, she said that they began seeing more police cars and hearing more sirens as the day progressed.\n\n“The residents and tourists are all out on their balconies watching from afar,” she told ABC4. “Even those right next to the fires stood on top of their buildings and watched as the cars and buildings burned.”\n\nShe added that because most of the buildings there are made of concrete, cartel members focused their bombings on buses and cars.\n\n“An eerie silence has fallen over the city,” she told ABC4. “Now the worst sound is the occasional motorcycle going by. The best sound is the military helicopters patrolling nonstop.”\n\nShe said that part of today’s devastation is the impact it will have on the city and country. She told ABC4 the cartel violence is going to scare people, halt tourism, and destroy the livelihoods of many living there.\n\n“This is a beautiful city, rich with natural resources and amazing people,” she said. “So many Americans have a perception that it is always dangerous here, but until today, I have never felt the least bit in harm’s way, not in all my trips to Mexico, including Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlán, Cabo, Guanajuato, and Mexico City.”\n\nShe added that she is praying that today was an isolated event that will not shut down the country, or destroy its people.\n\nFlights to and from Puerto Vallarta are cancelled at this time. Taxis and ride shares are also suspended in the region. A full list of impacted areas is available here.\n\nMarkkanen returns, but Jazz lose to Rockets 125-105\n\nTemporary boat ramp in the works to maintain access to Cataract Canyon at Lake Powell\n\nUtah 2034: Building the roadmap to another legacy\n\nPolice respond to shots fired on 9000 S in Sandy\n\nBrigham City man sentenced to prison for sexually abusing his child, possessing CSAM",

This winter still hasn’t recorded as much as usual, but by mid-February, some areas across the state received some much-needed snow.\n\nWhat exactly is a ‘bomb cyclone’?\n\nDenver only saw some flakes fly throughout the week, with nothing recordable on the ground, but other areas recorded almost 4 feet of snow.\n\nHere’s where the most snow fell from Sunday, Feb. 15, through Sunday, Feb. 22, according to Iowa State University’s local storm report:\n\nWolf Creek Pass in Pueblo County saw the most snow with 44 inches, nearly 4 feet, throughout the week. Meanwhile, areas like Crested Butte, Cameron Pass and Rabbit Ears Pass saw over a foot of snow. This snowfall brought a good amount of snow to the ski resorts, but snow totals are still low this winter.\n\nKentucky has seen more snow than Denver this winter\n\nLast year, some ski areas were recording 200 inches of snowfall around mid-to-late February, but this year, areas that have seen some of the most snow so far, like Crested Butte, have only seen 109 inches.",

    "description": "Their statement says Christians have a moral obligation to condemn the demonization of immigrants and attacks on civil rights and diversity.",
    "fullText": "Hundreds of Christian leaders and scholars nationwide are denouncing President Donald Trump’s administration and urging more active resistance among the faithful to “the injustices and anti-democratic danger sweeping across the nation.”\n\n“We are facing a cruel and oppressive government,” their collective statement begins. “In moments like this, silence is not neutrality — it is an active choice to permit harm.”\n\nTitled “A Call to Christians in a Crisis of Faith and Democracy,” the letter says the nation is facing a profound moral, spiritual, and democratic emergency. Its release coincides with the start of the Christian season of Lent, a period of repentance, self-reflection and resistance to temptation.\n\n“We thought it was important to tie into a season where many Christians go deeper into their faith,” said Adam Russell Taylor, president of Sojourners, a Christian social justice organization. “Part of what we’re critiquing is the way in which many White evangelical Christians succumb to an unconditional support of the administration, despite the fact that its actions are completely antithetical to the teachings of Jesus.”\n\nLeaders of all faiths have increasingly spoken out and participated in protests against the policies of the Trump administration, particularly aimed at what many see as overly aggressive efforts to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. Pastors have been arrested and struck with pepper balls during demonstrations.\n\nThe statement says Christians have a moral obligation to speak out against “citizens and immigrants being demonized, disappeared, and even killed; the erosion of hard-won rights and freedoms; and a calculated effort to reverse America’s growing racial and ethnic diversity – all of which are pushing us toward authoritarian and imperial rule.”\n\n“This moment is a defining test of Christian discipleship and civic responsibility,” said the Rev. Jim Wallis, founder and director of the Georgetown Center for Faith and Justice in Washington, D.C.. “Democratic freedoms are being taken away and the gospel is being distorted. The vulnerable people Jesus told us to stand with and defend are being targeted and assaulted.”\n\nWallis and Taylor organized the collective effort along with Barbara Williams-Skinner, president of Baltimore’s Skinner Institute, a faith leadership development organization.\n\nAbout 400 people initially signed the statement, representing a range of Christian denominations, leaders of Black, Asian and Latino churches and associations and Christian universities and institutions. Hundreds more have added their names since the letter’s Feb. 18 release, organizers say.\n\nThe Executive Office of the President of the United States, which includes the White House office, did not respond to a request for comment about the statement.\n\nThe Christian leaders and scholars say aside from the risks to democracy, they are troubled by “a Christian faith corrupted by the heretical ideology of white Christian nationalism.”\n\n“People look at it as just a democratic crisis, but it’s not,” said the Rev. Cynthia Hale, pastor of Ray of Hope Christian Church in Decatur, Georgia, who was among those who signed the letter. “It’s a crisis of faith.”\n\nChristian nationalism, the idea that Christian people and biblical law should govern American life, has seeped into the highest levels of American government with conservative evangelicals becoming a major political force with strong support of Trump. Evangelical pastor Doug Wilson, who has said women should neither vote nor hold religious or political leadership positions, was recently invited by Secretary of War Pete Hegseth to conduct a service at the Pentagon.\n\n“Their religious leaders have been so unconditionally supportive that it’s almost branded this administration as being religious in the minds of many Americans, which is a distortion,” said Bishop Raymond Rivera of the Council of Holistic Christian Churches and Ministries, who also signed the letter. “They’ve confused proximity to political power with proximity to the power of God. They’re not the same.”\n\nTaylor called such conflation “a form of idolatry” and said the Trump administration in turn has misused Christian language to support its activities, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement recruitment ads that quote scripture in their appeals – one ad, for instance, includes a verse saying “Blessed are the peacemakers.”\n\n“That feels particularly offensive and egregious in light of the tactics we’ve seen them employ in Minneapolis, Chicago, Los Angeles and elsewhere,\" he said. \"It’s corrupting the Christian faith to advance its own political agenda.”\n\nKristin Kobes Du Mez, a professor of history and gender studies at Calvin University, a Christian institution in Grand Rapids, Michigan, said she initially wondered before signing whether the moment required something more than signing yet another statement.\n\n“I realized this statement isn’t primarily for people who have been on the front lines of these issues but for pastors and ordinary Christians who may be just waking up to what’s happening and what’s at stake,” Du Mez said. “I think it’s important to offer a statement that clarifies the political and theological stakes and that people can put their name behind…. This is a way for ordinary Christians to step up.”\n\nThe letter concludes by tying a set of core theological convictions to actions the signers pledge to take to practice their faith and protect democracy, including defending voting rights, pursuing peace and standing with unjustly targeted immigrants.\n\nDottie Escobedo-Frank, bishop of the United Methodist Church’s California-Pacific Conference in Pasadena, said she signed the letter to encourage her Southern California community and all Christians to live out their callings to serve the downtrodden, demonstrate compassion and challenge political leaders to act on their behalf.\n\nHowever, with church ministries offering food distribution, childcare or elderly assistance having faced disruption from ICE agents or anti-immigrant demonstrators, “we’re seeing people in our communities who are afraid to live out their faith because of the actions of our government,” she said.\n\nTaylor understands many may be justifiably fearful of living out their creed but said it’s critical for people to engage at a time when “the pages of the authoritarian playbook are very much in effect,” he said.\n\nHe said one way to overcome such fears, aside from leaning into the resilience of faith itself, is to connect with other Christians. The letter effort includes a website where supporters can find ways to get involved.\n\n“One of the most consistent refrains in scripture is ‘do not be afraid,’” Taylor said. “Authoritarian governments thrive on people feeling isolated and overwhelmed, so we’re trying to create a network of solidarity and courage. We have the power to prevent things from getting worse.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Christian leaders say silence no longer option amid 'crisis of faith'",

    "description": "It came just days after Cooper announced he was leaving CBS show.",
    "fullText": "Anderson Cooper debunked President Donald Trump‘s claims of a “genocide” of white South African farmers on Sunday’s (February 22) edition of 60 Minutes.\n\nThe report, which The Daily Beast says was previously delayed by new CBS News boss Bari Weiss and subjected to an “abnormal” editing process, aired on Sunday’s show and saw Cooper traveling to South Africa to investigate Trump’s claims.\n\nIn the segment, Cooper played a clip of the president speaking to reporters in May 2025, in which he said, “It’s a genocide that’s taking place that you people don’t want to write about. It’s a terrible thing that’s taking place and farmers are being killed. They happen to be white.”\n\nTrump repeated these claims a week later when South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the White House. The president showed Ramaphosa video “proof” of what he said were “Burial sites. Over 1,000… of white farmers.” The video featured a row lined with several white crosses.\n\nCooper spoke with the man who erected those crosses, Darrel Brown, who said, “It definitely wasn’t a burial site. I mean those crosses were there for less than 48 hours. It was purely an avenue of crosses we planted there in honor of commercial farmers in South Africa that had lost their lives.”\n\nBrown, who keeps the crosses in a shed, said he put the crosses back up in 2024 for the funeral of his best friend, Tollie Nel, who was murdered on his farm.\n\nCooper also spoke with Tollie’s widow, Rene Nel, and asked her whether she would consider what is happening on South African farms to be a “genocide.”\n\n“Not what I know as a genocide,” she said. “Not what I’ve heard of what a genocide is. I see our attack as an opportunistic attack. They knew there was money. They knew there were firearms.”\n\nJohann Kotzé, the head of South Africa’s largest agricultural organization, also denied Trump’s claims. “It’s actually not about white genocide,” he stated. “It’s about criminality in South Africa. It’s crime. The fact that it happened on a farm doesn’t make me special as a farmer. It’s horrendous. Any murder is horrendous.”\n\nThe report comes just days after Cooper announced he will be leaving 60 Minutes at the end of the current broadcast season. He will continue to host Anderson Cooper 360 on CNN.\n\n60 Minutes, Sundays, 7/6 c, CBS\n\nRead the latest entertainment news on TV Insider.",

    "title": "Why has it gone so wrong for Aston Martin?",
    "description": "The combination of Adrian Newey, Honda and Fernando Alonso was highly promising but Aston Martin are in trouble. Andrew Benson explains why.",
    "fullText": "When Aston Martin's new Formula 1 car first appeared in testing at the end of January, it drew admiring glances up and down the pit lane.\n\nIn its all-black temporary colour, the car not only looked menacing, but also noticeably different from all its rivals. It included the sort of innovations that have become famous from design legend Adrian Newey, installed as managing technical partner at Aston Martin since March last year.\n\nBut reality bit hard as soon as the car started to run. It was already late, and it managed just four laps on its first day in Barcelona before conking out at the entrance to the pit lane.\n\nAston Martin's fortunes have barely improved since.\n\nThe car was the slowest in the field by the end of pre-season testing last week, and had done the least miles.\n\nTeam owner Lawrence Stroll looked like the bottom had fallen out of his world as he stalked the paddock in Bahrain, his face betraying a combination of anger and despair.\n\nThe few times the car was out on track amid myriad reliability problems, it looked a handful for the drivers. Publicly, Aston Martin and Honda were saying little. Privately, no-one was troubling to try to hide the reality. They were in trouble, they knew it, and whatever was wrong - and it was a lot - it would take time to fix.\n\nNo Formula 1 team looked towards the 2026 season with greater expectations than Aston Martin.\n\nOn paper, Stroll had put together a dream combination, one that seemed guaranteed to produce success.\n\nThe signing of Newey in September 2024 seemed to be the final piece of the jigsaw the Canadian billionaire was creating to turn his team into championship contenders.\n\nIn the previous years, Stroll had already inked a deal to become the factory engine partner of Honda, who won four consecutive drivers' titles with Red Bull and Max Verstappen from 2021-24, and two constructors' championships.\n\nHe had funded a sparkling new factory, including a state-of-the-art wind tunnel and driver-in-the-loop simulator.\n\nHe had put together an enviable sponsorship portfolio of boundless resources, including the full financial might of the state of Saudi Arabia, through its national oil company.\n\nAnd in the cockpit was another legend, Fernando Alonso. Ageing, certainly, now he is in his mid-40s, but still without question a major force behind the wheel.\n\nThe past few years have not been easy for Aston Martin. A major step forward at the start of 2023, when Alonso first joined the team, led to six podiums in the first eight races and what could have been a win in Monaco, lost only to a wrong tyre choice during a late shower of rain.\n\nBut in the second half of that season the team slipped back, as they failed to keep up the development rate of their rivals. The same happened in 2024, from a lower starting point, and in 2025 they were simply uncompetitive, slipping to seventh in the championship from fifth the previous two years.\n\nNewey's arrival was supposed to herald the start of the turnaround, especially as historically he has aced regulation changes, producing design philosophies that were followed by rivals - in 1998 with McLaren, and again in 2009 and 2022 with Red Bull.\n\nThe biggest rule regulation change in F1 history for 2026 gave him the chance to do it again, this time for Aston Martin.\n\nBut the first car produced under his leadership has fallen far short of expectations, and a glance at the context makes this less of a surprise than it appears on the surface.\n\nIn F1, success comes from stability, and that is the last thing Aston Martin has had in the past few years. There has been major leadership churn, and right at the top, too.\n\nThis has included new recruits, such as chief technical officer Enrico Cardile, who finally arrived in July after a year on gardening leave from Ferrari.\n\nBut also casualties. The most recent was Andy Cowell, the architect of the success of the Mercedes engine in the hybrid era. He was installed as chief executive officer only in October 2024, but just over a year later, after a clash with Newey, was demoted to a different role.\n\nCowell is now spending much of his time in Japan, trying to help Honda sort itself out.\n\nAston Martin were already playing down expectations when they had their official team launch in early February, emphasising the project would need time to become successful.\n\nNewey has explained that his starting in March left them some months behind other teams in terms of development.\n\nThe new 2026 aerodynamic regulations were finally officially published on 2 January 2025, two months before Newey officially started work at Aston Martin.\n\nIn reality, teams have been working on their 2026 cars for much longer than that. The basics of the cars' layouts in the rules had been known for some time, and the teams had all been in working groups refining the detail with governing body the FIA, so knew where they were going.\n\nThe word is that when Newey arrived in March 2026, he effectively ordered a redesign of the car on the basis of his ideas. So the current car is several months, at least, behind all its rivals in terms of development. With that sort of deficit, even he cannot work miracles.\n\nNewey has described the Aston Martin as \"one of the more extreme interpretations\" of this year's new rules.\n\nRight now, in its under-developed form, there is no question it is uncompetitive - slow and unpredictable. It may yet turn out that it can be developed into a good car, but until Honda sorts itself out, it will be hard to tell.\n\nHonda's plight has brought back painful memories of a decade ago.\n\nWhen it returned to F1 in 2015 with McLaren, it was underprepared, and spent three difficult seasons with engines that were underpowered and unreliable. The similarities with now are unmistakable.\n\nWhy it is so unprepared this time is less understandable.\n\nHonda officially pulled out of F1 at the end of 2021, when Max Verstappen took a Red Bull powered by their engine to his first world title.\n\nIt announced its return to F1 with Aston Martin in May 2023.\n\nThe argument given to explain now being so far behind is that Honda's F1 engine project was essentially disbanded and the engineers involved reallocated to other areas of the company in the 15 months between the two dates.\n\nHowever, it's not like Honda went away. Both Red Bull teams continued to use its engines until the end of last year.\n\nAlthough there was a development freeze, the engine was still being upgraded each year because F1's regulations allowed modifications for reliability reasons. Every manufacturer in F1 uses this loophole to produce performance upgrades in the name of improved reliability.\n\nIf Honda had not been doing this, it would have fallen behind progressively from 2022 to 2025, which it did not.\n\nOn top of that, Honda representatives were involved in meetings about the new engine rules all the way through - hence their U-turn on involvement in early 2023.\n\nStill, the argument is that without a fully dedicated F1 engine department, Honda lacked a team designing and building a new engine to the revised rules for this year, and had to build one up again more or less from scratch.\n\nBut so did Red Bull. In 2020, when they announced their decision to build their own engine factory, they had nothing. The original plan was to go into partnership with Porsche, but that deal foundered by late summer 2022.\n\nConsidering Red Bull had to build a powertrains factory from literally nothing in this period, and recruit an entirely new staff, their timeline is not that dissimilar from Honda's.\n\nSo why is Honda so far away from where it wants to be? No answer to that has been provided.\n\nA new car and engine partnership with Honda that struggles for reliability and performance and has Fernando Alonso as one of the drivers. If that sounds familiar, it's because it is.\n\nIn 2015, Alonso joined McLaren from Ferrari wooed by the promise of Honda's potential. That potential was eventually realised - but not until 2020/21, by which time Honda and McLaren had long since split and Honda had joined forces with Red Bull.\n\nAlonso's career, meanwhile, became a kind of living purgatory. One of the greatest drivers the sport has ever known reduced to fighting for scraps, making up his own targets for motivation, rather than what he should have been gunning for - wins and titles in F1.\n\nHe last won a race in May 2013, and he is now 44. But his performances have continued on a high level, and the respect he has from his peers on the grid is higher than ever. For his talent, and his ability to keep up his motivation in the face of everything.\n\nThe Newey-Honda-Aston Martin combination on paper promised Alonso something positive, a last hope of a return to success with which to bring his storied career to a close. Either this year, when his current contract runs out, or perhaps after one more, if glory seemed tangible.\n\nInstead, he has found himself transported back in time 10 years.\n\nAlonso has waited an entire career to work with Newey, the excellence of whose cars - and some terrible luck - have denied the Spaniard at least two further world titles that he should have won.\n\nAlonso won't doubt Newey can sort this out. Who would? But after his experiences with Honda last time, can he really convince himself that it can turn this around in the limited time he surely still has available?\n\nIn public, Alonso is staying optimistic, just as he did with McLaren and Honda, bar one or two public slips when it all got too much.\n\n\"Everything can be fixed, for sure,\" he says. \"Short and medium term. I don't think there is anything that is impossible to fix.\n\n\"We will try to fix everything we can before Australia and after that we try to fix as many things as possible in the first couple of races. Because (otherwise) it's too late in the championship. But no, I'm optimistic. I think there is a solution in place.\"\n\nAlonso's partner, Melissa Jimenez, is expecting their first child in late March.\n\nThe emergence of the unfolding catastrophe that is Aston Martin-Honda is so recent that he's not yet been asked about his thoughts on his future. But he will already be considering what to do.\n\nDoes he roll the dice one last time, try to summon the energy and commitment to go again after what will doubtless be a very trying year? Or call it quits?\n\nWho are the winners and losers from F1 pre-season testing?\n\n'Keep calm,' says Domenicali on criticism of new F1 rules",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court said Monday that it will hear from oil and gas companies trying to block lawsuits seeking to hold the industry liable for billions of dollars in damage linked to climate change.\n\nThe conservative-majority court agreed to take up a case from Boulder, Colorado, one of multiple lawsuits alleging the companies deceived the public about how fossil fuels contribute to climate change.\n\nGovernments around the country have sought damages totaling billions of dollars, arguing it's necessary to help pay for rebuilding after wildfires, rising sea levels and severe storms worsened by climate change. The lawsuits come amid a wave of legal actions in California, Hawaii and New Jersey and worldwide seeking to leverage action through the courts.\n\nThe case out of Boulder County will likely have implications for other lawsuits, some of which have been dismissed while others work their way through state courts.\n\nSuncor Energy and ExxonMobil appealed to the Supreme Court after Colorado’s highest court let the Boulder case proceed. The companies argue emissions are a national issue that should be heard in federal court, where similar suits have been tossed out.\n\n“The use of state law to address global climate change represents a serious threat to one of our Nation’s most critical sectors,” attorneys wrote. ExxonMobil said Monday that “climate policy shouldn’t be set through fragmented state‑court actions.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration weighed in to support the companies and urge the justices to reverse the Colorado Supreme Court decision, saying it would mean “every locality in the country could sue essentially anyone in the world for contributing to global climate change.”\n\nTrump, a Republican, criticized the lawsuits in an executive order, and the Justice Department has sought to head some off in court.\n\nAttorneys for Boulder had agued that the litigation is still in early stages and should stay in state court. “There is no constitutional bar to states addressing in-state harms caused by out-of-state conduct, be it the negligent design of an automobile or sale of asbestos,” they wrote.\n\nCity officials said the case was about dealing with problems people are facing in Colorado. “Our case is, fundamentally, about fairness. Boulder is already experiencing the effects of a rapidly warming climate, and the financial burden of adaptation should not fall solely on local taxpayers,\" said Jonathan Koehn, its climate initiatives director.\n\nThe Supreme Court also asked the two sides to present arguments on whether the case is truly ready to be heard by the justices. Arguments are expected in the fall.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court.",

    "fullText": "Zachery Ty Bryan was sentenced to 16 months for a 2024 DUI arrest – his sixth arrest in just five years – after a California judge denied probation as part of a plea deal, according to court records.\n\nThe “Home Improvement” and “Tokyo Drift” actor pleaded guilty at an arraignment hearing in Riverside County, where he acknowledged his prior DUI convictions and an enhancement for driving above a 0.15% blood-alcohol level, TheWrap learned Tuesday.\n\nBryan was credited with 57 days of time served and sentenced to 16 months in county jail. His request for probation was denied.\n\nBryan, a former child actor best known for his role on the ABC sitcom starring Tim Allen, was arrested in Oregon last November. The arrest violated his existing probation, and he was briefly held in Eugene without bail before being released.\n\nBryan had been serving probation from a prior domestic assault conviction. His fiancée, Johnnie Faye Cartwright, was also arrested during the November incident and booked on five charges, including driving under the influence, reckless endangerment and attempted assault.\n\nBryan was also arrested in January 2025 in Myrtle Beach, S.C., on a charge of second-degree domestic violence. In that case, Cartwright, who shares three children with Bryan, told police that he had choked and punched her.\n\nBryan’s sentence came from one of two DUI charges from 2024 – once in February and again in October. In 2023, he was charged with misdemeanor harassment, third-degree robbery and fourth-degree felony assault.\n\nIn 2020, Bryan was arrested in Oregon for allegedly strangling his then-girlfriend at their home.\n\nBryan rose to fame in the 1990s playing Brad Taylor on “Home Improvement.” His film credits include “True Heart” and “The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.” He also appeared in the Netflix series “The Guardians of Justice,” which debuted in 2022.\n\nThe post ‘Home Improvement’ and ‘Tokyo Drift’ Star Zachery Ty Bryan Sentenced to 16 Months in DUI Plea Deal appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United climbed into the Premier League top four with a hard-earned 1-0 victory over Everton, as Benjamin Sesko’s second-half strike proved decisive at the Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\nMichael Carrick’s side arrived knowing that three points would move them above Chelsea, and they delivered in a contest short on quality but rich in significance.\n\nUnited began brightly and almost took an early lead when Amad Diallo’s low effort was parried by Jordan Pickford before James Tarkowski cleared off the line.\n\nEverton responded with energy but struggled to carve out clear openings against a disciplined visiting back line.\n\nJames Garner tested Senne Lammens with a dipping free-kick before the interval, yet clear-cut chances remained limited.\n\nThe first half was defined by intensity rather than incision, with both sides cancelling each other out in midfield.\n\nEverton started the second period with greater urgency and Harrison Armstrong forced a sharp save from Lammens inside the opening minute.\n\nUnited gradually regained composure and Bryan Mbeumo spurned a promising opportunity when he volleyed over from close range.\n\nCarrick turned to his bench just before the hour mark, introducing Sesko in search of greater penetration.\n\nThe substitution proved decisive 13 minutes later with a swift counter-attacking move.\n\nMatheus Cunha initiated the break with a forward pass into space for Mbeumo, who drove at the retreating defence.\n\nMbeumo waited for support and delivered a precise ball into the path of Sesko, who had sprinted from deep.\n\nThe Slovenian striker applied a composed first-time finish beyond Pickford to register his eighth goal of the season.\n\nEverton pushed forward in response and Michael Keane unleashed a powerful effort that was tipped over by Lammens.\n\nThe hosts continued to press in the closing stages but United defended resolutely to preserve their narrow advantage.\n\nSesko had an opportunity to add a second late on but failed to control cleanly when sent through on goal.\n\nThe final whistle confirmed a vital away win that strengthens United’s Champions League ambitions.\n\nCarrick’s men now sit fourth, overtaking Chelsea and building momentum at a crucial stage of the campaign.\n\nThe defeat extends Everton’s frustrating run at home and leaves them searching for consistency.\n\nSesko’s timely intervention once again proved the difference in a tightly contested encounter for United.",

The franchise also has interest in Alabama signal-caller Ty Simpson in April's draft.\n\n\"Packers backup quarterback Malik Willis and Alabama’s Ty Simpson are among the external quarterbacks on the Browns’ radar with the NFL Combine kicking off Tuesday and free agency starting in two weeks,\" Cabot said.\n\nSigning Willis would be a savvy move by general manager Andrew Berry.\n\nWillis has done a terrific job filling in for Jordan Love over the last two seasons, showcasing his efficiency with a 78.7% completion rate on 89 passes with Green Bay.\n\nThe Liberty product possesses a dynamic skillset that head coach Todd Monken can maximize. Monken coached Lamar Jackson with the Baltimore Ravens for three seasons, so he knows a thing or two about working with mobile quarterbacks.\n\nSpotrac projects Willis will land a $71 million contract over two seasons in free agency, an average annual value of $35.5 million. That would be a hefty price point, but one Cleveland would pay if they believe Willis can be their quarterback of the future.\n\nRams $44 million cut candidate could land with Bills, Patriots, Steelers\n\nKyle Pitts rumor is bad news for Giants, Commanders, Eagles, Broncos\n\nFalcons rumor could lead to trade with Steelers, Dolphins or Jets\n\nMaxx Crosby rumor gives Bills, Cowboys, Eagles, Pats minimum trade price\n\nRumor from NFL Network reveals Browns' interest in top free agent",

    "fullText": "Manchester United boss Michael Carrick praised the impact of super-sub Benjamin Sesko after the Slovenian's cool finish earned a 1-0 win at Everton on Monday night.\n\nSesko is yet to start in Carrick's six matches in charge but has come off the bench to net in three of his last four appearances with vital goals.\n\nThe 22-year-old also scored a late winner against Fulham and rescued a point against West Ham deep into stoppage time in United's previous outing.\n\nSesko started the move that led to the winning goal as all of United's £200 million ($270 million) trio of attacking signings last summer combined to great effect.\n\nMatheus Cunha picked out the run of Bryan Mbeumo, who squared for Sesko to slot home his sixth goal in seven appearances since Ruben Amorim was sacked in January.\n\nVictory lifted United into the Premier League's top four, three points clear of Liverpool and Chelsea in the battle for a place in next season's Champions League.\n\n\"It was a ruthless finish, I like the way he put it away with real confidence,\" said Carrick, who has five wins and one draw since taking charge at Old Trafford.\n\n\"Great play from Matheus and Bryan to set it up. Delighted for Ben again, coming on and making the difference.\"\n\nUnited did not hit the height of sparkling performances to beat title challengers Arsenal and Manchester City in Carrick's first two matches in charge during an uninspired clash at the Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\nBut the former Middlesbrough boss was delighted with a third clean sheet in six games.\n\nUnited had held opponents goalless just twice in 29 matches this season before Carrick's arrival.\n\n\"We had to do a lot of work. Credit to Everton they made it difficult, made us defend our box a lot. The spirit with which we defended the box was top class,\" added Carrick.\n\nGoalkeeper Senne Lammens made a couple of vital saves to continue an impressive debut season at United for the 23-year-old Belgian.\n\n\"Senne was oustanding tonight,\" said Carrick. \"You couldn't hope for much more from a goalkeeper. It was an exempalary performance, so delighted for him.\n\n\"You want (a goalkeeper) to take the chaos away and Senne is that. That calmness and composure helps those in front of him.\"",

    "description": "In an article naming possible landing spots for a projected $71 million quarterback, the Pittsburgh Steelers, Minnesota Vikings and Arizona Cardinals were mentioned.",
    "fullText": "Steelers, Vikings, Cardinals named possible landing spots for $71 million quarterback originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThere are going to be plenty of teams in the market for a quarterback this offseason, and among them could be the Pittsburgh Steelers, Minnesota Vikings and Arizona Cardinals.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, the Steelers still don't have an answer on Aaron Rodgers. If he doesn't come back, the Steelers need to make an addition to a quarterbacks room that would include the unproven Will Howard and backup Mason Rudolph.\n\nThe Vikings have J.J. McCarthy under contract, but he failed to cement himself as the team's locked-in starter for the long haul after a poor second season. As a result, the expectation is the Vikings are going to at least add veteran competition.\n\nAs for the Cardinals, it appears Kyler Murray's days are numbered. If he is shown the door, we would bet Arizona won't be keen on staking its future to the Jacoby Brissett wagon, no matter how well he played in 2025.\n\nOne quarterback who could be the most coveted in free agency is Green Bay Packers signal-caller Malik Willis. On SI's Ethen Hutton believes the Steelers, Cardinals and Vikings are all possible landing spots for him.\n\n\"Willis projects to be a sound fit in Minnesota’s talented offense under quarterback-friendly coach Kevin O’Connell. Monitoring his fantasy football outlook, his stock would take a sizable leap with Jefferson and Addison on the perimeter,\" Hutton said of Willis to the Vikings. \"His consistency as a passer will help elevate the Vikings’ offense, with significant upside among fantasy entering the 2026 season. His rushing upside will also pair well with the likes of Aaron Jones and Jordan Mason in the run game, bolstering the rushing attack.\"\n\n\"In Pittsburgh, Willis would join an offense featuring DK Metcalf and a talented tight end trio featuring the likes of Pat Freiermuth, Darnell Washington and Jonnu Smith,\" he said of Willis to Pittsburgh. \"He’d also add a new dynamic to the Steelers’ backfield tandem of Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell. From a fantasy football perspective, his stock would take a sizable leap in Pittsburgh, filling the team’s need for a franchise quarterback. His outlook is highly encouraging for fantasy managers as Willis gears up for his first season as a starter.\"\n\n\"Willis fits Arizona’s offense system under new head coach Mike LaFleur, the brother of Packers head coach Matt LaFleur, as the team looks to bring in another mobile quarterback,\" Hutton said of the Liberty product going to Arizona. \"From a fantasy football standpoint, the Cardinals offer one of the best supporting casts of any team on our list, bolstering Willis’ fantasy stock immensely for the 2026 season. With Willis set to take over a starting job, he’s slated to break out in fantasy football next season. The Cardinals’ weapons could help Willis emerge as one of fantasy’s top quarterbacks next season, with additional upside as a rusher in LaFleur’s offense.\"\n\nA former third-round pick of the Tennessee Titans, Willis looked like he was going to be a bust after two years in the NFL. Then, a trade to the Packers changed everything.\n\nWillis didn't see a ton of action while serving as Jordan Love's backup, but he no doubt made the most of his opportunities and looked like a completely different quarterback than the one we saw in Nashville.\n\nHe showed he can make all the throws, and with accuracy, and his decision-making and pocket presence was top notch. As an added bonus, Willis has plus-athleticism to escape the rush.\n\nWillis doesn't come without some risk, though.\n\nWe believe Willis will command something close to what Spotrac projects, which is a two-year, $71 million contract. That might seem crazy for a guy with just six career starts, but he should enough promise to warrant that kind of money.\n\nEssentially Sports' Tony Pauline reports that many around the league believe Willis is going to end up with the Cardinals, so Arizona is a realistic possibility, assuming they do indeed cut or trade Murray.\n\nThe Steelers' interest in Willis will depend upon what happens with Rodgers, but if the future Hall of Famer doesn't return, we believe Pittsburgh would be willing to take a swing on Willis.\n\nWhen it comes to the Vikings, reports suggest they would like to sign a veteran quarterback, but we would not rule Minnesota out from pursuing Willis if head coach Kevin O'Connell believes he can be an upgrade over McCarthy.\n\nKyle Pitts rumor is bad news for Giants, Commanders, Eagles, Broncos\n\nFalcons rumor could lead to trade with Steelers, Dolphins or Jets\n\nMaxx Crosby rumor gives Bills, Cowboys, Eagles, Pats minimum trade price\n\nRumor from NFL Network reveals Browns' interest in top free agent\n\nCardinals believed to be most likely landing landing spot for $71M QB",

    "fullText": "Fairhope (Ala.) St. Michael Catholic four-star quarterback Gunner Rivers is following in his father’s legendary footsteps.\n\nThe son of former NFL star and future Hall of Famer Philip Rivers has committed to NC State, choosing to join the Wolf Pack 26 years after his father did back in 2000. Gunner chose NC State over reported offers from Auburn, Georgia, Miami, Boston College and more.\n\nOne of the top quarterbacks nationally in the 2027 class, Rivers has long been thought of as a lean to the school where his father won ACC Player of the Year honors in 2003 and Rivers broke almost every NC State and ACC passing record.\n\nGunner himself has had a record-breaking high school career and is coming off a junior season where he completed 208 of 290 passes (72%) for 2,813 yards, 44 touchdowns and just five interceptions. In the process, he led St. Michael Catholic to a 13-1 record and an appearance in the state title game vs. powerhouse Jackson.\n\nStanding in at 6’3 and 200 pounds, he ranks as the nation’s No. 117 overall prospect and No. 12 quarterback, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, an equally weighted average that utilizes all three major recruiting services.\n\nHe also ranks as the No. 4 player from the state of Alabama this cycle.\n\nRivers is undoubtedly one of NC State’s biggest football recruiting wins in program history. His pledge gives head coach Dave Doeren and the Wolfpack four commits early on in the 2027 cycle.\n\nRivers joins Homerville (Ga.) Clinch County three-star safety Kamarion Johnson, Raleigh (N.C.) Cardinal Gibbons three-star tight end Griffin Cockerham and Southeast Raleigh three-star running back Christian Freeman.\n\nLast cycle, NC State signed the nation’s No. 46 class, according to the Rivals Industry Team Recruiting Rankings. It’s early, but the addition of Rivers could provide the Wolfpack with some serious recruiting momentum heading into the spring.\n\nNC State has not signed a top-25 class in the internet recruiting era. It’s highest-ranked haul came in the 2008 cycle, when it landed the No. 26 class that was headlined by four-star QB Mike Glennon.",

    "fullText": "Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao made boxing history in 2015.\n\nMore than a decade later, the two boxing legends are hoping to do it again.\n\nThe two will fight in a professional rematch Sept. 19. The event, which will be streamed live on Netflix, will be the first boxing match to be held at the Las Vegas Sphere.\n\nThe first time around, Mayweather defeated Pacquiao by unanimous decision on May 2, 2015, in the so-called \"Fight of the Century\" at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.\n\n\"I already fought and beat Manny once,\" Mayweather said in a statement released by Netflix. \"This time will be the same result.”\n\nThat fight generated 4.6 million pay-per-view buys and a live gate of $72 million, both of which are still records.\n\nIt was a long-awaited matchup between two of the biggest names in the boxing world — 38-year-old Mayweather (47-0, 26 KO) and 36-year-old Pacquiao (57-5-2, 38 KO) — that ultimately earned Mayweather the World Boxing Council, World Boxing Assn. and World Boxing Organization welterweight titles.\n\nThe backdrop to this year's bout is a bit different. Mayweather is now 50-0 (27 KO) and will be 49 on Tuesday. He has retired and unretired multiple times but has not fought in a bout that counts since his 10-round technical knockout of Conor McGregor in 2017.\n\nAlthough he still has an exhibition fight against Mike Tyson coming up on a still-unannounced date this spring, Mayweather announced last week that he is resuming his professional fighting career.\n\nPacquiao, 47, is 62-9-2 (39 KO). In July, he lost by majority draw to WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios in an attempt to break his own record for oldest welterweight champion. He was 40 when he defeated Keith Thurman for the title in 2019.\n\nPacquiao recently announced a a 10-round welterweight exhibition against former junior welterweight world champion Ruslan Provodnikov on April 18 at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas.\n\n\"Floyd and I gave the world what remains the biggest fight in boxing history,\" Pacquiao said in a statement released by Netflix. \"The fans have waited long enough — they deserve this rematch, and it will be even bigger now that it will be streamed live globally on Netflix. I want Floyd to live with the one loss on his professional record and always remember who gave it to him.\"\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

I can read between the lines on that. It's a shot at Black Americans. We're controlling the sport. They're tired of us controlling the sport.\n\n\"'France is coming for you.' Really?

    "description": "Everton 0-1 Manchester United: Super-sub Sesko scored from the bench for the third time in four games as he finished off a devastating counter-attack",
    "fullText": "When Manchester United were looking for a saviour this season, they opted not to revert to their greatest super-sub. They may not have Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in the dugout but they seem to have his successor in spirit on the pitch. Benjamin Sesko is yet to start a game under Michael Carrick but he has come off the bench to score three times, all significant, delivering an extra five points.\n\nFirst the winner against Fulham, then an equaliser at West Ham, now a decider at Everton. It was early by Sesko’s standards – in the 71st minute, rather than injury time, when Jordan Pickford denied him a second – but it felt further evidence of Carrick’s nous. United had looked blunt before his arrival, lacking inspiration and a focal point in attack. Sesko is the only pure No 9 in the squad and, once again, he illustrated the merits of a penalty-box presence. In time, Carrick may have an issue if he can keep naming Sesko on the bench. For now, their alliance is benefiting both. Carrick said: “I have got a really good relationship with Ben. He has taken some huge steps recently.”\n\nIn a game low on drama, the goal came from a sweeping move. Everton, who had been the more positive in the second half, may regret committing too many men forward, leaving themselves open to the counter-attack which, whether under Carrick or Solskjaer, tends to be United’s most potent weapon.\n\nSesko was involved twice in a move that involved their three big summer signings. He laid the ball off to Matheus Cunha, who sprayed a diagonal pass to release Bryan Mbeumo. He was confronted only by Michael Keane and squared the ball for Sesko, who had run 70 yards to slide in a shot. “It was a ruthless finish,” said Carrick. “I like the way he put it away with real confidence.” It was the Slovenian’s eighth goal for United. He only had two in 17 games when Ruben Amorim was sacked.\n\nAnd United have been transformed since then. They took their haul under Carrick to 16 points from a possible 18, a charge that is putting them on a path towards the Champions League. A distinctly mundane match nevertheless produced a fine result for United.\n\nArguably, they undid some of the damage done on one of Amorim’s most ignominious nights. In November, his United were clueless when confronted with the 10 men of Everton and lost at Old Trafford. The rematch was different and not just because Idrissa Gueye completed the evening without slapping a teammate. Unlike Amorim, Carrick found a way. Successful substitutions have been a theme of his reign, and not just those involving Sesko.\n\nFor one of his predecessors, it was a frustrating reunion. David Moyes has now seen Everton go seven games without a win at Hill Dickinson Stadium. They are yet to record a win over elite opposition at their deluxe ground and, when they were looking more ambitious than United, they conceded.\n\nThey had rarely threatened to in the preceding hour. They almost struck early, when James Tarkowski cleared Amad Diallo’s fourth-minute shot off the line, though Pickford had taken some of the sting out of it. Thereafter, Diogo Dalot thudded a long-range half-volley into the advertising hoardings while, after the break, Mbeumo blazed a shot over from an acute angle.\n\nIf the first half had seemed a contest to give the ball away most, United could savour the earthy qualities that earned them a result. “I'm delighted with the result and spirit, the boys digging deep and sacrificing for each other,” said Carrick. He played his own part. They had too little threat on either flank, so he removed Amad, brought on Sesko and recalibrated his side.\n\nMoyes, of course, did not have a £73m striker in reserve; or in the team, for that matter. “The quality you are talking about costs big money,” he lamented.\n\nThe cheaper striker he does have, Thierno Barry, could have scored inside 10 seconds, albeit without knowing much about it, when Senne Lammens slammed a clearance into him. After that, the Belgian impressed rather more. “Senne was outstanding tonight,” said Carrick. “As a goalkeeper you couldn’t hope for much more: safe hands, calm, composed, an exemplary performance.”\n\nLammens held on to James Garner’s well-struck free kick, saved from Harrison Armstrong less than 30 seconds into the second half and, as Everton chased an equaliser, tipped away Keane’s thunderbolt from distance and thwarted the replacement Tyrique George in injury time. “Their goalie was bloody brilliant,” said Moyes, who nominated Lammens as his man of the match. Everton had directed a series of corners under the bar. They had not realised Lammens would deal with them so well, Moyes reflected ruefully.\n\nWith three summer signings combining for the goal, a fourth excelling in goal, it felt a triumph of United’s recruitment. Of players and, more recently, a head coach.",

    "fullText": "The NFL Competition Committee has discussed a change to the league's rules that would allow replay officials throw penalty flags for fouls that went unpunished on the field.\n\nNFL executive vice president of football operations Troy Vincent said on Monday that the conversation centered on non-football acts that were unpenalized by on-field officials. Vincent cited Seahawks cornerback Josh Jobe striking Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs during Super Bowl LX and Seahawks linebacker Derick Hall stepping on Rams guard Kevin Dotson during the regular season as plays that could be addressed by the change. Jobe was fined for his act and Hall was suspended for one game, but neither was penalized during the game.\n\n\"You don't want to just be expanding the Pandora’s box, but we believe that things like the non-football act, you can really, really restrict what that is,\" Vincent said, via ESPN.com. \"That's something that we believe that potentially there's a little bit of tweaking in the language, that may be the first step.\"\n\nIf the league moves forward with this change, there will likely be more questions in the future about allowing replay officials to make calls on other clear penalties that are missed on the field.",

    "description": "Connelly Early returned this spring sporting an additional 15 pounds of muscle. Monday gave him a chance to try out his new physique on the mound.",
    "fullText": "PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. — Some pitchers go home for the winter with instructions about how to add a new pitch or refine an old one.\n\nThe Red Sox liked what they saw of him in September, and trusted him enough to give him the ball for Game 3 of the Wild Card round in Yankee Stadium.\n\nInstead, the organization advised Early last fall to focus on getting bigger and stronger.\n\nUnlike his closest friend on the team, Payton Tolle, Early doesn’t have the classic power pitcher build. And in order to maximize his stuff and maintain it deeper into outings, the Red Sox wanted him to concentrate on his body.\n\nThere was a revamped diet to start with, and lots of time in the weight room .\n\n“I think we challenged him,” said manager Alex Cora, “and he did (get bigger). I think he added 15 pounds. He’s a lot stronger. That’s going to help him raise the floor on his fastball, maintain the fastball throughout his outings. If he can accomplish that, it’s going to be fun. It was fun last year.”\n\nEarly’s fifth big league start came on the biggest postseason stage imaginable and he showed his poise by not wilting. Early fanned six in 3.2 innings in an elimination game for his team and though he was charged with three earned runs, that was misleading as the team committed several misplays behind him.\n\n“It was a great experience, one that’s going to make him better for his career,” said Cora. “He didn’t care (about the pressure). From the anthem all the way through when he took him out, he was under control.”\n\nEarly’s first major league spring training officially got underway Monday with two scoreless innings against the Tampa Bay Rays at Charlotte Sports Park. He faced seven hitters, and retired six, charged with only a walk.\n\n“I felt good today,” said Early after a 2-1 Red Sox defeat. “Body felt good. I felt comfortable out there. Hopefully, a byproduct of (the added muscle and strength) is the velo ticking up. I think it was in a pretty good spot today, so hopefully, that continues to go up.”\n\nEarly said he didn’t feel much differently on the mound with the added bulk and doesn’t want to obsess about radar gun readings this spring.\n\n“If we’re getting swing-and-misses on (the fastball) and we’re getting some chase,” he said, “it’s a good enough pitch. I’m not too worried about the velo. Honestly, it’s more about holding the floor of the velo at a good spot and feeling good and being able to bounce back from starts.”\n\nThe real test will come later in camp, when Early gets out to five and six innings and discovers whether he’s able to keep the velocity up after 75 or so pitches.\n\nIn the meantime, the Red Sox will want to see Early refine his approach on the mound to pay attention to details: monitoring his tempo, keeping baserunners close and other less obvious facets of the game.\n\n“Polish,” concluded Cora. “He has a good understanding of what he needs to do. His secondary pitches play at this level; they did last year. But there’s more. There’s some progression. He’s not a final product. The physical aspect of it is going to benefit him.”\n\nFenway Insider: Connelly Early makes Grapefruit League debut for Red Sox\n\nRed Sox newcomer given honorable mention on MLB insider’s Top 10 third basemen list\n\nRed Sox reliever wants first baseball card — and to solidify himself as big leaguer in Year 5\n\nAlex Cora’s shout out gave Boston Red Sox trade acquisition ‘more energy’\n\nRed Sox lineup includes players competing for Opening Day roster spots",

    "fullText": "The Buffalo Bills announced that they have re-signed defensive tackle Phidarian Mathis. The former second-round pick agreed to a one year contract. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nStaying in Buffalo ‼️\n\nWe have re-signed OL Alec Anderson and DT Phidarian Mathis each to one year contracts.\n\n— Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) February 23, 2026\n\nMathis, who will turn 28 in April, was chosen 47th overall by the Washington Commanders in the 2022 NFL Draft. He spent three injury-plagued seasons with the club, totaling just 25 tackles and two tackles for loss across only 23 games. Washington released him in December 2024, and he signed with the New York Jets’ practice squad. He did not appear in a game for Gang Green, and he was released in August 2025.\n\nMathis signed with Buffalo’s practice squad on September 10, 2025. The Bills elevated him for two contests—a 23-20 loss to the New England Patriots in Week Five and a 28-21 win over the Kansas City Chiefs in Week Eight—before signing him to their 53-man roster on November 5. Mathis played in four more games during the regular season, and in two of them, he was a huge contributor. He had four tackles in victories over the Cleveland Browns and the New York Jets. Overall, he showed good burst and solid anchor against the run, totaling 13 tackles in his six regular season games.\n\nMathis also played six snaps in the Bills’ Wild Card victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. At 6’4” and 312 lbs. with 34.5” arms, he profiles as someone who can play multiple spots along an odd-man defensive line, which is the scheme the Bills will utilize under new defensive coordinator Jim Leonhard. Coming out of Alabama, NFL Network’s Lance Zierlein called him a “scheme-versatile player” who could play nose tackle in either an odd front or an even front, or a 5-tech defensive end in a 3-4 scheme. Zierlein’s professional comparison for Mathis was DaQuan Jones, Buffalo’s top 1-tech defensive tackle for the last four seasons.\n\nNews had previously leaked regarding Buffalo re-signing offensive lineman Alec Anderson, and the Bills officially announced his signing in the same release announcing the Mathis contract.",

    "description": "Two of the top offensive players in this year's free agent class may not hit the open market. Here's how that'll impact the rest of free agency.",
    "fullText": "Free agency is weeks away but two major players might not be at the negotiating table.\n\nTight end Kyle Pitts and wide receiver George Pickens are the major prizes of free agency on offense. Teams besides the Atlanta Falcons and Dallas Cowboys, respectively, could be out of luck for negotiating with them.\n\nAtlanta is reportedly using the franchise tag on Pitts and Cowboys co-owner Stephen Jones inferred that was likely for Pickens as well.\n\n“I wouldn’t put any timeframe (on a contract),” Jones told reporters. “Once you have a tag, you have a tag. We know George is going to be here.”\n\nThe franchise tag is a tool teams can use to prevent one player per year from reaching free agency. The tag is a one-year, fully guaranteed contract calculated using other salaries at the position.\n\nIt prevents the player from securing a longer-term deal from another team at the cost of a fully guaranteed salary.\n\nNon-quarterbacks rarely play a season with the franchise tag. Instead, it's often used as a tool to keep the player at the negotiating table for their original team for longer. Jones' quote points to the Cowboys using the franchise tag to keep Pickens in the building to iron out a contract before the start of 2026. If not, he'll play the season on that one-year deal.\n\nHere's what it means for the rest of free agency at their positions if Pickens and Pitts aren't free to negotiate league-wide:\n\nPickens is by far the top wide receiver available in this free-agent class. Second-team All-Pro wide receivers rarely are available - especially ones who haven't hit their second contract yet. That's why the Cowboys are motivated to keep him in-house.\n\nIf Pickens stays with Dallas, that moves all of the other free agents up a spot in the rankings and with it likely a bump in pay.\n\nFellow 2022 draftees Alec Pierce and Rashid Shaheed will become the top free agents at wide receiver. Both offer excellent speed on the outside and Shaheed's a dynamic threat in the return game. Jauan Jennings offers a more possession-based skillset but could get a bump in salary with Pickens off the market as well.\n\nHere's the top 10 free agent wide receivers by projected average annual value (AAV) of their future contracts after Pickens, per Spotrac:\n\nJauan Jennings, San Francisco 49ers: $22.61 million\n\nAlec Pierce, Indianapolis Colts: $20.24 million\n\nWan'dale Robinson, New York Giants: $17.64 million\n\nDeebo Samuel, Washington Commanders: $15.77 million\n\nTyreek Hill, Miami Dolphins: $15.07 million\n\nRashid Shaheed, Seattle Seahawks: $14.12 million\n\nMike Evans, Tampa Bay Buccaneers: $13.31 million\n\nRomeo Doubs, Green Bay Packers: $12.00 million\n\nKeenan Allen, Los Angeles Chargers: $6.81 million\n\nHollywood Brown, Kansas City Chiefs: $5.5 million\n\nPitts has draft pedigree as the No. 4 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, as well as recent production with his second-team All-Pro award in 2025.\n\nLike Pickens, there's a mix of options beyond him at the position, either veterans or second-contract players. Teams will have to decide if they value more youth or production at the position with handing out money in this free-agent cycle. Without Pitts, there's a chance the other players have a chance to make more money but the overall tight end market isn't on the same level as wide receiver. Teams aren't as willing to spend big on the position in the same way.\n\nHere's a look at the top 10 free agents at the position without Pitts, per Spotrac projected AAV:\n\nTravis Kelce, Kansas City Chiefs: $10.77 million\n\nDavid Njoku, Cleveland Browns: $9.99 million\n\nIsaiah Likely, Baltimore Ravens: $8.81 million\n\nChig Okonkwo, Tennessee Titans: $7.96 million\n\nCade Otton, Tampa Bay Buccaneers: $7.91 million\n\nDallas Goedert, Philadelphia Eagles: $6.00 million\n\nTyler Higbee, Los Angeles Rams: $5.35 million\n\nTyler Conklin, Los Angeles Chargers: $3.33 million\n\nNoah Fant, Cincinnati Bengals: $3.22 million\n\nDarren Waller, Miami Dolphins: $3.21 million\n\nAll the NFL news on and off the field.

    "fullText": "Girona earned a point at Mendizorrotza after drawing 2-2 against Deportivo Alavés in an intense match that was decided in the final moments. Míchel's team managed to respond to the initial blow from the Basques but saw the victory slip away in the 89th minute.\n\nThe match started off difficult for the Girona side. In the 5th minute, Boyé put Alavés ahead, taking advantage of a quick action inside the box that caught the visiting defense off guard. The early goal forced Girona to take control of the game and patiently look for their scoring opportunities.\n\nThe response came in the 31st minute. Vanat finished off a set-piece play after a corner to restore balance and reward the growing dominance of the red-and-whites. The goal gave Míchel's team confidence, and they ended the first half with better sensations and control of the ball.\n\nIn the second half, Girona made a decisive step forward. With more presence in the opponent's half and a more vertical passing game, the Catalans found their reward in the 73rd minute. Ounahi, returning to action after the Africa Cup of Nations and his injury, showcased his quality and assisted Tsygankov with a precise pass that the winger coolly converted into a 1-2 lead.\n\nJust as Girona was on the verge of securing three points, a cold shower arrived. In the 89th minute, Boyé scored his second goal, capitalizing on a shot inside the box to make it 2-2. It was an excessive punishment for a Girona side that had managed to come back and created the clearest chances to win the match.\n\nDespite the final disappointment, the point leaves Girona in eleventh place in the standings, with the good news of Ounahi's return, who was instrumental in the second goal. Next Sunday, March 1st, at 9:00 PM, Girona will host Celta de Vigo at Montilivi.",

    "title": "The Surprising Reason Atlanta Braves May Not Sign Another Starter Despite Injuries",
    "description": "The Braves may not make any starting pitching additions.",
    "fullText": "The Atlanta Braves were linked to a number of starting pitchers this past offseason. They ultimately did not upgrade their rotation, though. After it was recently announced that both Spencer Schwellenbach and Hurston Waldrep are dealing with injuries, rumors began to swirl once again. According to MLB insider Ken Rosenthal, however, the Braves are not interested in two of the top remaining starting pitchers in free agency.\n\nThe Braves, among other teams facing starting pitching injuries, don't seem as intrigued by Lucas Giolito or Zack Littell as you'd expect at the moment, says @Ken_Rosenthal. pic.twitter.com/PELbxh9qT0\n\n— Foul Territory (@FoulTerritoryTV) February 23, 2026\n\nRosenthal pointed to the fact that Bryce Elder and Joey Wentz are both out of options. As a result, they would be placed on waivers if demoted to the minor leagues. Rosenthal reports that the Braves \"evidently\" don't believe signing Lucas Giolito or Zack Littell would be worth the possibility of losing Elder and/or Wentz off waivers.\n\n\"They don't feel Giolito and Littell are enough of an upgrade, I guess, over Wentz and Bryce Elder,\" Rosenthal said.\n\n\"Scherzer is also out there,\" Rosenthal added. \"But Scherzer, it looks like, looks like he might be headed back to Toronto.\"\n\nScherzer landing with the Toronto Blue Jays would make sense, as previous reports have echoed a similar sentiment. However, Giolito and Littell remain available.\n\nLittell spent 2025 with the Tampa Bay Rays and Cincinnati Reds. He ended up making a total of 32 starts, pitching to a 3.81 ERA. He'd be a good depth starter for a number of ball clubs.\n\nGiolito pitched well with the Boston Red Sox a season ago. He recorded a 3.41 ERA across 26 starts.\n\nThe fact that both starters remain un-signed is surprising. One has to imagine they will land a deal sooner rather than later, but it apparently won't be with the Braves unless Atlanta changes its approach.\n\nIt is worth noting that Elder was an All-Star in 2023. He has not been the same pitcher since, as he recorded a 5.30 ERA in 2025. Wentz spent time with the Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates and Minnesota Twins last year, finishing the campaign with a 5.60 ERA across 39 total appearances (13 starts).\n\nElder has displayed signs of potential in the past and Wentz offers versatility given his ability to start or pitch in relief, but not signing Giolito or Littell because Elder and Wentz don't have options would obviously be a questionable move. It would be different if Atlanta was not looking to compete, but the Braves feature an overall talented ball club and would benefit from bringing in at least one more veteran starter amid Schwellenbach and Waldrep's injury concerns.",

    "fullText": "James Harden says he's more than just an NBA player: 'I am a system' originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJames Harden’s most talked-about quote didn’t come after a 50-point night. It came in a press room—and it hasn’t left the conversation since.\n\n“I’m just not a system player; I am a system,” Harden said in 2023.\n\nMORE: Angel Reese serves First Lady teas in fitted Versace\n\nAt the time, the line drew pushback. But in 2026, as detailed in reporting by Brandon “Scoop B” Robinson, the statement reads less like a headline grab and more like a clear explanation of Harden’s role on the floor.\n\nNow with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Harden’s game has shifted from high-volume scoring to full-scale orchestration. Playing alongside Donovan Mitchell, he’s tasked with managing possessions, directing spacing, and creating opportunities before defenses can react.\n\nHarden described what matters most in that role: “Somebody that can have that dialogue with me and understand and move forward and figure out and make adjustments on the fly throughout the course of games, that’s all I really care about. It’s not about me scoring.”\n\nThat approach has defined Cleveland’s structure. With frontcourt options like Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen, Harden’s ability to process the floor in real time has become central to how the offense functions. Instead of operating within a set system, he dictates it—controlling tempo, reading coverages, and forcing defensive shifts.\n\nSpeaking with Robinson, Harden compared that responsibility to elite NFL quarterbacks, pointing to Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, Lamar Jackson, and Patrick Mahomes.\n\n“The greats,” Harden said. “All those guys have decisions to make in every possession… It’s a split second.”\n\nMORE: Devin Booker shades Bad Bunny Halftime performance: 'I'm Mexican'\n\nThe comparison highlights how Harden views the game. Each possession begins with a read—defender positioning, help coverage, timing—and ends with a decision. Whether it’s a pass to a rolling big or a kick-out to a shooter, the outcome is shaped by those initial reads.",

    "description": "Cleveland Browns starting S Ronnie Hickman is a restricted free agent, Kamren Curl could fill is role in free agency",
    "fullText": "The 2026 free agent list for the Cleveland Browns is a sad sight. There are plenty of guys that GM Andrew Berry could have signed to extensions during this past season, but did not. And now, these talented players are headed to the free agency period, which begins March 9.\n\nOne name really stands out: Safety Ronnie Hickman.\n\nIn the Browns’ defensive back room, the following are listed on the free agent list: S Rayshawn Jenkins, CB M.J. Emerson, CB Tre Avery, CB Sam Webb, CB D’Angelo Ross, CB Anthony Kendall, and Hickman. Webb is a restricted free agent, whereas Kendall is an exclusive rights free agent.\n\nHickman is also a restricted free agent. This means a player who has three accrued seasons with an expired contract. He can negotiate with other NFL clubs, subject to “tender offers” from his original team. Cleveland would have the right of first refusal to match any offer sheet.\n\nIf Hickman leaves, or if Berry does not re-sign him before free agency begins, there is trouble in paradise with the safety room. Grant Delpit is the other starter, along with the youngster Donovan McMillon and journeyman Chris Edmonds.\n\nKamren Curl could come in and become the Day 1 starter for the Browns.\n\nThere are plenty of very good safeties in all rounds of the April NFL draft, including Ohio State’s Caleb Downs, who is ranked the #5 prospect in this year’s NFL draft. The Browns are picking at #6, so that is a huge possibility for Cleveland.\n\nHowever, Berry might have his sights on another player and hopes that the draft falls his way. Waiting to see where Downs goes is not prudent. Berry should consider bringing in another safety from free agency first.\n\nBerry is a former college cornerback, so he has always provided the defensive back room with plenty of talent and developmental players. This group is Berry’s pet project.\n\nThis past NFL season, the Browns ranked #4 in the league in defense. Break that down into the #3 passing defense and the #16 rushing defense, so the importance of pass coverage with Cleveland’s defense has been a huge focus.\n\nNFL draft: 2020 Round 7, pick #216 (Commanders)\n\n2025 season: 17 starts, 122 tackles, 2 QB hits, 2 sacks, 2 interceptions, 5 batted passes, 4 pressures, 2 hurries, 0 knockdowns, 2 tackles for loss, 1 forced fumble, 0 fumble recoveries, 0 batted passes, 7 missed tackles, 47 receptions allowed, 1,112 defensive snaps (99%), 46 special teams snaps (10%)\n\n586 career tackles in just six seasons. Had a career high this past season with 122 and had 115 in 2023. Very durable and has missed very few games. 93 games played with 86 NFL starts, so he has the experience. His vertical jump is 34.5.”\n\nHe is a versatile defensive back with underrated coverage abilities and has zero issues coming up and supporting the run-stopping game. He is known across the league as one of the league’s best run-stopping safeties.\n\nBut Curl’s talents don’t just stop with large tackling numbers. He can play free safety, box, lined up at strong safety in college, and play linebacker in the 4-2-5. He is a good blitzer and lends a hand at cornerback if needed.\n\nHe is a reliable tackler with just seven missed tackles this past year. Curl excels at closing on the ball and understands passing lanes. Very good instincts and productive.\n\nCurl does lack elite speed, which is a reason why he doesn’t line up at cornerback. And at times his angle pursuit is off, which results in additional yardage gained. His backpedal is smooth and even.\n\nRuns the alley with adequate effort to free himself from blockers. Reads combinations and comes out clean as deep safety.\n\nHe is good on kickoff teams as well, so he comes with special teams value. He was paid $9 million on a two-year deal with the Rams.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Detroit Lions and Las Vegas Raiders are predicted to pull off a trade involving two players, including edge rusher Max Crosby.\n\nBleacher Report's Alex Ballentine's trade proposal sends Crosby to the Lions and cornerback Terrion Arnold to the Raiders.\n\nThe hypothetical trade would also have Las Vegas acquiring the No. 17 overall pick in April's draft and a 2027 second-round pick:\n\n\"The Lions make a lot of sense as a team that has lost momentum as a contender, though. Dan Campbell's group seemed to fade from the spotlight as the year went on. Pairing Crosby with Aidan Hutchinson puts them right back in that spotlight. It would finally give Crosby a strong bookend while putting the Lions right back in the NFC conversation.\"\n\nAcquiring Crosby would take the Lions' defense to the next level and catapult Dan Campbell's squad to Super Bowl contention.\n\nA pass-rushing duo of Crosby and Aidan Hutchinson would be unstoppable and would cover up other weaknesses Detroit may have on defense.\n\nTrading for Crosby will cost the Lions premium draft capital and a player, and Arnold could be the player Las Vegas wants. The young corner played just eight games in 2025 due to a shoulder injury, but when healthy, he's a solid starter who will only get better.\n\nHowever, giving up Arnold to land a game-changer like Crosby is a no-brainer for the Lions. Crosby is one of the best players in football, tallying three double-digit sack seasons in the past four years.\n\nDespite all the trade speculation, Crosby will likely remain in Las Vegas this season, but if he does request a trade and gets moved by the Raiders, the Lions should be a top landing spot, especially if Detroit fails to re-sign breakout edge rusher Al-Quadin Muhammad in free agency.\n\nRams $44 million cut candidate could land with Bills, Patriots, Steelers\n\nKyle Pitts rumor is bad news for Giants, Commanders, Eagles, Broncos\n\nFalcons rumor could lead to trade with Steelers, Dolphins or Jets\n\nMaxx Crosby rumor gives Bills, Cowboys, Eagles, Pats minimum trade price\n\nRumor from NFL Network reveals Browns' interest in top free agent",

Antonio Gibson, who originally joined the team on a three-year, $11.25 million free agency deal in 2024, was released after two seasons and 22 total games with the organization.\n\nThe move itself did not come as too big a surprise. Not only was Gibson little more than a rotational option in the Patriots’ backfield with an unclear outlook given that Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson reside atop the depth chart, he also is currently rehabbing a torn ACL suffered in October.\n\nThat said, let’s take a bigger-picture view at what the transaction means from a New England perspective.\n\nThe Patriots entered the offseason with six true running backs under contract for the 2026 season, including Gibson as the projected RB3 behind the aforementioned Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson. With him no longer a piece of the puzzle, one layer of depth has been removed behind the top pair and is leaving the group looking as follows:\n\nRunning back (5): Rhamondre Stevenson (38), TreVeyon Henderson (32), Terrell Jennings (26), Lan Larison (34), Elijah Mitchell (45)\n\nOutside of those six players, the Patriots also have two backfield players headed for free agency. Both running back Deneric Prince and fullback Jack Westover are exclusive rights free agents.\n\nEven if Prince and Westover are retained, the Patriots are lacking established depth or long-term developmental upside behind Stevenson and Henderson. While they project as a formidable one-two punch, no Gibson as the third option means that the team might be on the lookout for another player with a similarly versatile skillset.\n\nBefore tearing his ACL in Week 5 against the Buffalo Bills, Gibson had not just served as the Patriots’ third running back but also their top kickoff return man. As such, he had averaged 28.5 yards on his 12 runbacks and also scored a 90-yard touchdown in Week 2 versus Miami.\n\nOnce Gibson was lost for the year, the Patriots were unable to find similar production and home-run potential. Six other players returned kickoffs for them on the year — running backs Rhamondre Stevenson, TreVeyon Henderson, Terrell Jennings and D’Ernest Johnson as well as wide receivers Kyle Williams and Efton Chism III — but none emerged as a clear featured option.\n\nWith Gibson now officially out of the picture, the competition will start at zero again. Based on flashes, Henderson and Williams seem like the frontrunners at the moment, but there are a lot of factors plus future roster changes that are likely to change that projection.\n\nOne of the reasons why Gibson getting released was no surprise was his contract. Carrying a $4.14 million salary cap number, he was the 21st most-expensive player on the team right now. That in itself might not have been a release-worthy problem, but the structure of the pact invited a change: only his $1 million signing bonus proration for the 2026 season was fully-guaranteed.\n\nThat $1 million will now be added to the Patriots’ dead cap space for 2026. Meanwhile, the team created $2.14 million in net savings: his gross savings of $3.14 million minus another player with a $1 million salary cap number taking his spot on the Top 51 list of contracts to be counted against the cap once the new league year starts in mid-March.\n\nAccording to salary cap expert Miguel Benzan, Gibson’s release now puts the Patriots $44.3 million under a projected league cap of $304.3 million.\n\nConsidering that Gibson was released with a failed physical designation, however, it appears that he qualifies for the NFL’s injury protection benefit. If so and he remains unsigned heading into the new season, the Patriots might be charged $2.1 million against their cap at the start of the regular season. In that case, the financial gains of releasing the 27-year-old would be minimal.\n\nThe Patriots’ 2024 offseason was their first without Bill Belichick presiding over their football operations. So, who was the first free agent added under the new regime led by Eliot Wolf and then-head coach Jerod Mayo? That would be one Mr. Antonio Gibson.\n\nWith Gibson now gone, so is another remnant of the Mayo-era Patriots. In fact, less than 14 months after his firing, only 23 players remain with the team who played under the one-and-done coach as pointed out by Ethan. Hurwitz of Sports Illustrated.\n\nWith Antonio Gibson's release, here's the list of remaining Patriots under contract for 2026 that played under Jerod Mayo:\n\n– Christian Gonzalez\n– DeMario Douglas\n– Kayshon Boutte\n– Drake Maye\n– Marte Mapu\n– Bryce Baringer\n– Dell Pettus\n– Marcus Jones\n– Terrell Jennings\n-…\n\n— Ethan Hurwitz (@HurwitzSports) February 23, 2026\n\nWhile his failed physical might have forced their hand a bit, the Patriots had no real reason to release Gibson now as opposed to closer to the start of free agency on March 11. However, with the entire league embarking on Indianapolis this week for the NFL Scouting Combine, getting cut now allows Gibson a head start of sorts.\n\nSure, teams will be cautious when it comes to a running back who tore his ACL just four months ago, but Gibson’s name is at least out there already and he can start taking visits and undergoing physical examination with other clubs right away. Other veteran running backs who might end up competing against him on the open market might not be in that same position yet.",

    "fullText": "Everton 0 - 1 Manchester United FT\n\nBenjamin Sesko was Manchester United's super-sub for the second match running as the Slovenian scored the only goal against Everton to send Michael Carrick's men clear in fourth spot.\n\nThirteen days after Sesko struck deep in injury time to rescue a point at West Ham, the £73.7m forward applied a clinical first-time finish to a 71st-minute counter-attack that he had started deep in his own half.\n\nSesko kept motoring after laying a pass off to Matheus Cunha. By the time Cunha had delivered a long pass to Bryan Mbeumo, the eager Sesko had outrun Everton's defence and was on hand to stroke home his eighth goal of the season.\n\nRemarkably, only two of those goals came under former boss Ruben Amorim, with three coming in Darren Fletcher's two-game stint in interim charge and three under Carrick, who has now won five of his six games at the helm.\n\nIt was a moment of class that was a long time in coming in a match that was low on quality at Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\nBoth sides struggled against obdurate defences, having gone almost a fortnight without a game after playing early in the last round of matches, late in this one and with no FA Cup game in between after respective early exits.\n\nIn a game of few chances, James Tarkowski cleared off the line in the first half after an effort from Amad was half-saved by Jordan Pickford.\n\nVisiting goalkeeper Senne Lammens denied teenager Harrison Armstrong, who had Everton's best attempt before Michael Keane let fly with a thunderous long-range effort eight minutes from time. The shot was heading towards the top left corner but Lammens was again alert, with the Belgium international tipping the ball over.\n\nThis result means it is now seven home games without a win in all competitions for Everton, who sit ninth.\n\nWhat did you make of Everton’s display?\n\nHave your say on Manchester United's performance\n\nIn six games at the helm, Carrick has made two changes to his starting line-up, both due to injury.\n\nLisandro Martinez missed this one because of a minor calf problem, which meant Leny Yoro had to step in at the back.\n\nHe is backing his players, and he knows there is firepower on the bench too.\n\nWhen United performed as poorly as they had done at West Ham, some critics were already taking to social media to claim the bubble had burst.\n\nHowever, Carrick has trust in Sesko. With less than an hour gone and with little sign of a goal coming, Carrick sent on his towering forward.\n\nHis finish was not as eye-catching as the one at London Stadium, but he held his nerve when it mattered.\n\nSesko should have had a second after he was sent clear by Diogo Dalot as the game entered stoppage time.\n\nIf he had taken it, it would have spared United a few anxious minutes. As it was, he failed to control the ball properly, and England goalkeeper Pickford was able to see off the danger.\n\nSesko's goals in his latest two games could prove priceless as United strive for one of what seem certain to be five Champions League places for English teams.\n\nNot only have United put three points between themselves and Chelsea and Liverpool, who sit fifth and sixth, but they are now only three points behind third-placed Aston Villa, who they entertain at Old Trafford in three games' time.\n\nDavid Moyes wore a look of irritation and frustration as he went to shake hands at the final whistle.\n\nThe Scot knew that for much of the contest his home side had been the equal of the club he once managed.\n\nBut, as has been the case often for Everton, big-spending opponents delivered a moment of quality for which the Toffees had no response.\n\nMoyes has promise in his squad. That was clear when looking at Armstrong, former United midfielder James Garner, who excelled at right-back, and Tyrique George, who was denied by Lammens deep in stoppage time as Everton desperately chased an equaliser.\n\nTarkowski, Pickford and Keane are reliable and experienced. But the elite level depth is not there.\n\nMoyes spoke in his programme notes about chasing targets beyond the ones Everton have recently been used to going after. In recent seasons, their mission has essentially been to deal with a chronic financial situation and stay up.\n\nA new stadium means new ambitions, and there has been no relegation danger this season. But Everton want more than mid-table security.\n\nThe only problem with that is – as Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace are finding out – without sufficient resources, juggling Premier League and European football is a fresh strain on resources than can be exceptionally tough to overcome.\n\nMoyes will keep pushing for those loftier spots in the table because it is his nature, but perhaps the top half and no more would not be a bad outcome for the first campaign away from Goodison Park.\n\nEverton are next in action in the Premier League at Newcastle United on Saturday, 28 February (15:00 GMT). Manchester United entertain Crystal Palace on Sunday, 1 March (14:00 GMT).",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFor many seasons, the Los Angeles Angels moved as Mike Trout did. He was the sole face of the club's offense after Shohei Ohtani signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers, and he has had a difficult time staying healthy.\n\nTrout missed a month of the season in 2025 after suffering a bone bruise in his left knee, the same knee he had surgery on in 2024. After coming back, he was reduced to being used as the primary DH for the club.\n\nAnd while Trout was trying his best to give the Angels all he had, someone else stepped up to be the face of the offense, and that would be outfielder Jo Adell.\n\nMORE: Angels players 'took notice' of owner Arte Moreno's recent comments\n\nMike Trout could only muster up 26 home runs last year, tying him for third place alongside Zach Neto. Taylor Ward would go on to have a great season, hitting 36 home runs, but it was not enough to be the home run leader for the Halos.\n\nThat prize would go to Adell, who hit a career-high 37 home runs last season over the course of 152 games.\n\nWhile he may take a step back this year, Bleacher Report's Joel Reuter believes he can be the home run leader for the Angels once again in 2026.\n\n\"Despite his poor batting average and middling defense, the Angels gave Jo Adell a full runway to prove himself last season. The 26-year-old responded by finishing in fourth on the AL leaderboard with a career-high 37 home runs, and while a potential Mike Trout resurgence looms, Adell now stands as a top-tier power threat.\"\n\nNow, if the Angels can get a healthy and resurging year from Trout, they could be in a much better position than they have been over the last few years.\n\nThe Pirates' home run crown could come down to three new faces\n\nEugenio Suarez returns to Cincinnati to reclaim his home run throne\n\nAnticipating a crowded leaderboard for the Athletics' home run crown\n\nMLB analyst makes the case for Kerry Carpenter to carry Detroit offensively\n\nNew walls and goals for Royals' star Bobby Witt Jr. in Kansas City",

    "fullText": "Thanks to Henri Veesaar's return on Saturday, the UNC basketball team is back in the win column. North Carolina roared ahead midway through the second half on Saturday, downing Syracuse 77-64 and sweeping the season series.\n\nEarlier last week, the Tar Heels lost an embarrassing, 82-58 rivalry battle with NC State. UNC looked overwhelmed from opening tip, with the host Wolfpack (19-8, 10-4 ACC) playing off a rowdy crowd.\n\nNorth Carolina is still in the rankings ahead of Monday night's home clash with Louisville – and a win should further improve its standing. In college basketball analyst Andy Katz' latest Power 37 rankings, the Tar Heels dropped to 29th.\n\nUNC sits between Iowa (28th) and Georgia (30). The Hawkeyes split a pair of ranked games last week, upsetting Nebraska and losing at Wisconsin, while the Bulldogs upset Kentucky and Texas.\n\nNorth Carolina is still awaiting Caleb Wilson's return, but his teammates are stepping up, including unlikely heroes like Zayden High. The Tar Heels' backcourt is still trying to find consistency, but senior captain Seth Trimble is a key behind big games.\n\nNEW #Power37 from @TheAndyKatz 🚨\n\n1. Duke\n2. Arizona\n3. Michigan\n4.

North Carolina hosts Virginia Tech on Saturday night at 8:30 p.m., Clemson next Tuesday at 7 p.m., then a rematch at Duke on March 7.\n\nThe Tar Heels currently sit in a sixth-place tie with Louisville in the ACC, meaning they'd have a single bye in the ACC Tournament.

    "description": "Murray has been sidelined for more than a year with a torn Achilles, but wants to play despite the Pelicans having the second-worst record in the West.",
    "fullText": "Just over a year after he suffered a torn Achilles, New Orleans Pelicans guard Dejounte Murray is ready to return.\n\nMurray, 29, is listed as available on the NBA injury report for Tuesday's matchup with the Golden State Warriors. The nine-year veteran ruptured his Achilles on Jan. 31, 2025, sustaining the injury on a non-contact play versus the Boston Celtics during which he lunged for the ball then immediately fell to the court.\n\n[\nMurray was in his first season with New Orleans after being acquired from the Atlanta Hawks for Dyson Daniels, Larry Nance Jr. and two first-round picks. He also missed 17 games with a broken hand earlier in the season, limiting him to 31 games overall.\n\nThe Pelicans are slogging through a season that has them second-to-last in the Western Conference (and fourth-worst in the NBA) at 16-42. With 24 games remaining, some might question Murray returning. But tanking doesn't serve much purpose for the Pelicans after trading this year's first-round selection to the Hawks to move up to select Derik Queen.\n\n\"I'm not one of those guys like I'm paid, I could get an extra 6-7 months, or our team is 14th in the West. There are a lot of excuses for a chump to say 'I'm not playing'. I am the opposite of that... I want to represent of New Orleans\"\n\n-- Dejounte Murray on New Orleans pic.twitter.com/NOB1LzV3IC\n\n— Pelicans Film Room (@PelsFilmRoom) February 23, 2026\n\n[Get more Pelicans news: New Orleans team feed]\n\nMurray also wants to see some game action after being sidelined for more than a year.\n\n\"I'm here, I love New Orleans, I love the people. This is the reason I'm coming back,\" Murray said to Pelicans Film Room on Monday.\n\n\"I'm not one of those guys like, I'm paid, I could get an extra 6-7 months, or our team is 14th in the West,'\" he added. \"There are a lot of excuses for a chump to say, 'No, I ain't playing.' I am the opposite of that.\"\n\nMurray will likely be on a minutes restriction as he works his way back. Pelicans interim head coach James Borrego didn't say for certain how much Murray might play, but praised him for wanting to get on the court.\n\n\"It speaks to his character, that he cares,\" Borrego said, via the Associated Press. \"I'm not saying that everybody coming off this injury would even play right now. This kid wants to play. He wants to be out there on the floor. He wants to compete. He wants to be out there with his teammates. He wants to win.\"\n\nDuring his eight NBA seasons, Murray has averaged 15.5 points, 5.8 rebounds, 5.4 assists and 1.5 steals per game playing for the San Antonio Spurs, Hawks and Pelicans. He missed the entire 2018-19 season with a torn ACL sustained during the preseason.",

    "fullText": "Kouri Richins, a Utah mom of three and children's book author accused of killing her husband last year, allegedly Googled \"luxury prisons for the rich\" after his death, according to new court documents.\n\nProsecutors say Richins, 33, poisoned her husband, 39-year-old Eric Richins, with fentanyl the evening of March 3, 2022, at their home in Kamas, just outside of Park City, while their three young sons were sleeping.\n\nShe also told police after her husband was found dead that \"he didn't just die in his sleep,\" records reveal.\n\nRichins appeared in court on Monday, when she was denied bail.\n\nUTAH CHILDREN'S BOOK AUTHOR ACCUSED OF MURDERING HUSBAND TOOK OUT $2M IN LIFE INSURANCE PRIOR TO HIS DEATH\n\nNew details of the case were revealed in court records, though, which show that investigators got access to Richins' phone and found various typo-ridden Google searches that they believe may be used as incriminating evidence against the suspect, though her defense team disagrees.\n\nShe apparently searched the following phrases beginning in April 2022: \"luxury prisons for the rich in america,\" \"how long does life insrance companies takento.pay [sic];\" \"can you delete everythjng on an old icloud account [sic],\" \"can deleted text messages be retrieved,\" \"what information can be cbtained from a cellphone [sic],\" \"how to turn find my iphone off [sic],\" \"can cops force you to do a lie detector test,\" \"when does FBI get involved in a case,\" \"what is considered a lethal.dose of fentanyl [sic],\" and \"what are you allowed inside utah jails.\"\n\nUTAH AUTHOR ACCUSED OF MURDEIRNG HUSBAND ALLEGEDLY CAUGHT TRYING TO STEAL HIS LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS\n\nRichins' Google Search history also included a search for her own net worth, various inquiries about ranches for sale in Tennessee and Montana and searches for her husband's family's ties to police in Summit County, Utah.\n\nThe suspect's defense attorney, Skye Lazaro, filed a response to the state's allegations on Sunday, saying her \"search history is merely in response to what was happening with the investigation, not evidence as of guilt as the State asserts.\"\n\nLazaro also pushed for Richins' release on bail \"because there is no substantial evidence to support the charges,\" though a judge on Monday denied bail for the murder suspect.\n\nAmy Richins, Eric’s sister, called her sister-in-law \"desperate, greedy and extremely manipulative\" in a statement read aloud during Richins' Monday bail hearing.\n\n\"How can anyone value human life so cheaply? I cannot comprehend it,\" she said.\n\nUTAH CHILDREN'S BOOK AUTHOR HAD ‘PERFECT’ MARRAIGE WITH HUSBAND BEFORE ALLEGED MURDER: FRIEND\n\nProsecutors allege Richins purchased four different life insurance policies on Eric Richins' life totaling more than $1.9 million between 2015 and 2017. On Jan. 1, 2022, months before his murder, Kouri \"surreptitiously and without authorization changed the beneficiary for Eric's $2 million life insurance policy to herself,\" the document states.\n\nPrior to his death, Eric took Kouri off his will and made his sister the beneficiary instead, according to investigators. His family told authorities he had been in fear for his life after Kouri allegedly tried to poison him once several years ago in Greece and again on Valentine's Day 2022.\n\nUTAH MAN ALLEGEDLY POISONED BY AUTHOR WIFE BELIEVED SHE WAS HAVING AFFAIR: FAMILY SPOX\n\nThe couple was apparently having financial disagreements due to Kouri's wish to purchase a $2 million mansion under construction in Wasatch County. She wanted to flip the mansion and sell it for a profit, a warrant states.\n\nEric apparently thought the home was too expensive, his family told investigators.\n\nUTAH CHILDREN'S BOOK AUTHOR, HUSBAND SPARRED OVER ‘CURSED’ MANSION BEFORE HIS ALLEGED MURDER\n\nKouri, who owns a real estate company, is accused of poisoning Eric with a Moscow Mule spiked with fentanyl, an opioid that is lethal in small doses, while they were celebrating a home sale March 3, 2022. The next day, Kouri allegedly closed a deal on the Wasatch County mansion \"alone,\" after her husband was pronounced dead.\n\nKouri told investigators the morning of March 4, 2022, that she did not know what happened to her husband after calling police to report his death, according to a transcript from police-worn body camera footage taken at the scene of Eric's murder.\n\n\"He didn't just die in his sleep. This is insane,\" she told police at the time.\n\nLater on, after finding out that her children heard their father had died, Kouri Richins apparently said, \"Oh, my God. This can't be happening. This can't be happening. This can't be happening.\"\n\nKouri's defense attorney alleges that Summit County officials did not read Richins her Miranda rights while they questioned her after Eric Richins' death and apparently ignored communication from her counsel. She is arguing that as a result of alleged malpractice, investigators should \"refrain from using the passcode to access Ms. Richins’ cell phone,\" the filing states.\n\nAdditionally, Kouri's defense team is taking issue with testimony from a witness identified as C.L. in court documents, who is currently in prison. C.L. told investigators that she sold fentanyl to Kouri prior to Eric's poisoning death, but Lazaro alleges that C.K. only identified the fentanyl after investigators pushed her to do so after questioning her for over an hour.\n\nAfter Eric's death, Kouri wrote a children's book about death, \"Are You With Me?\"\n\nA description for the book, which was listed on Amazon for $14.99, describes \"Are You With Me?\" as \"a must-read for any child who has experienced the pain of loss, and for parents who want to provide their children with the emotional support they need to heal and grow.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

    "description": "We release Steerling-8B, an 8B-parameter causal diffusion language model that is interpretable by construction — its predictions are routed through concepts you can measure, audit, and control.",
    "fullText": "We are releasing Steerling-8B, the first interpretable model that can trace any token it generates to its input context, concepts a human can understand, and its training data.\nTrained on 1.35 trillion tokens, the model achieves downstream performance within range of models trained on 2–7× more data.\nSteerling-8B unlocks several capabilities which include suppressing or amplifying specific concepts at inference time without retraining, training data provenance for any generated chunk, and inference-time alignment via concept control, replacing thousands of safety training examples with explicit concept-level steering.\n\nFor the first time, a language model, at the 8-billion-parameter scale, can explain every token it produces in three key ways.\nMore specifically, for any group of output tokens that Steerling generates, we can trace these tokens to:\n\nWe are releasing the weights of a base model trained on 1.35T tokens as well as companion code to interact and play with the model.\n\nBelow we show Steerling-8B generating text from a prompt across various categories. You can select an example, then click on any highlighted chunk of the output. The panel below will update to show:\n\nSteerling is built on a causal discrete diffusion model backbone, which lets us steer generation across multi-token tokens rather than only at the next-token.\nThe key design choice is decomposing the model’s embeddings into three explicit pathways: ~33K supervised “known” concepts, ~100K “discovered” concepts the model learns on its own, and a residual that captures whatever remains.\n\nWe then constrain the model with training loss functions that ensure the model routes signal through concepts without a fundamental tradeoff with performance.\nThe concepts feed into logits through a linear path, every prediction decomposes exactly into per-concept contributions, and we can edit those contributions at inference time without retraining.\nFor the full architecture, training objectives, and scaling analysis, see Scaling Interpretable Models to 8B.\n\nDespite being trained on significantly fewer compute than comparable models, Steerling-8B achieves competitive performance across standard benchmarks. The figure below shows average performance (across 7 benchmarks) versus approximate training FLOPs on a log scale, with vertical lines marking multiples of Steerling’s compute budget.\n\nIn the previous update, we shared several ways that assess how interpretable a model’s representations are.\nHere we provide another metric that gives insight into the model’s use of its concepts. On a held-out validation set, over 84% of token-level contribution comes from the concept module: the model is not just using the residual to make its predictions.\nThis matters for control: if the model’s predictions genuinely flow through concepts, then editing those concepts at inference time actually changes what the model does rather than nudging a side channel while the real work happens elsewhere.\n\nA useful check is what happens when we remove the residual pathway. On several LM Harness tasks, dropping the residual has only a small effect, which suggests the model’s predictive signal is largely routed through concepts rather than hidden “everything-else” channels.\n\nFinally, Steerling can detect known concepts in text with 96.2% AUC on a held-out validation dataset.\n\nIn the coming weeks, we’ll be releasing deep dives on each of these capabilities:\n\nWe’ll cover each of these in detail in upcoming posts, with quantitative evaluations and deployment-oriented case studies.",

    "fullText": "Life is complicated. Regardless of what your beliefs or politics or ethics are, the way that we set up our society and economy will often force you to act against them: You might not want to fly somewhere but your employer will not accept another mode of transportation, you want to eat vegan but are at some point in a situation where the best you can do is a vegetarian option.\n\nSometimes it’s not even our hand being forced but us not having the mental strength or priorities to do something: I could just not use WhatsApp because it is owned by Meta but my son’s daycare organizes everything through WhatsApp and do I really want to force my belief on all those very busy parents and caretakers or should I just bite the bullet and use the tool that seems to work for everyone – even though it’s not perfect?\n\nThere are no one-size-fits-all solutions for this: Sometimes a belief or ethic you hold is so integral to you that you will not move. Sometimes they are held loosely enough to let go under certain conditions. There’s a multitude of factors and thoughts that go into those kinds of decisions and at some point you just gotta make a call based on what’s in front of you and your priorities.\n\nWhat I am saying is: We are all doing things we know are not ideal, are either morally questionable or do not align with our values. That’s life. I for example know that consuming meat is problematic for ethical and ecological reasons, I still do it sometimes. I reduce as much as I can but I am far from perfect. Just one of the many examples of my actions not being perfectly and purely aligned with my beliefs.\n\nAnd I am 100% sure each and every reader will have similar experiences. We are imperfect and messy beings. In the end all you can do is actually try to make good decisions based on your values, try to learn from your actions and ideally do better – or at least understand what were the forces that go you to act against your values.\n\nCory Doctorow, probably one of the most influential writers about digital technology and culture celebrated the 6th anniversary of his personal blog pluralistic – congratulations! Cory is quite the phenomenon, I know nobody with his amount of output and his consistency of publication. It is scary just how consistently he writes and published while also churning out books. I do admire his work ethic tremendously.\n\nBut one thing in his celebratory post rubbed me the wrong way and I think it’s worth pointing out. Not for the one specific case but because it highlights a problematic way of thinking that I see a lot in current tech discourse that stands in the way of us actually improving the world.\n\nSo Cory outlines his process of how he publishes to his blog (and then pushes the same writing out to other places). He describes how one QA step in his process is piping his writing through an LLM (using the Ollama software, it’s unclear which open weight LLM he uses) to check for typos and small grammar mistakes. He then points out how some readers might find that problematic:\n\n“Doubtless some of you are affronted by my modest use of an LLM. You think that LLMs are “fruits of the poisoned tree” and must be eschewed because they are saturated with the sin of their origins. I think this is a very bad take, the kind of rathole that purity culture always ends up in.”\n\nUsing LLMs isn’t always popular with the cool crowd, Cory knows that. And he wants to defend his (quite modest) use, which I understand: Nobody likes their problematic behavior being pointed out to them. But as outlined: Life’s complicated. Cory could just have said “I know there are many critiques of LLMs, but right now that is the best way for me to enable my work, I try to limit the problematic aspects by using a small open weight model and checking the results in detail.” and have moved on. But he needed to make a stand. And that stand lead him into the problematic train of thought that I wanted to point out here. Because many, many people listen to him and basically take his word as the gospel. So great power, great responsibility and such.\n\nThe whole argument is based on a strawman. Let’s look at Cory’s words:\n\nLet’s start with some context. If you don’t want to use technology that was created under immoral circumstances or that sprang from an immoral mind, then you are totally fucked. I mean, all the way down to the silicon chips in your device, which can never be fully disentangled from the odious, paranoid racist William Shockley, who won the Nobel Prize for co-inventing the silicon transistor\n\nCory is right in pointing out that almost any technology we have has been touch by problematic figures. Racists, fascists, sexists, rapists. You name it. Anything you touch will have some research or engineering or product work by a person you despise in it.\n\nThe strawman is his claim that people who criticize LLM usage are doing that for some form of absolutist reasons. That they have a fully binary view of the world as separated into “acceptable, pure things” and “garbage”. Which is of course false. Because they are using a computer, using warm water that’s probably heated through the use of fossil fuels etc.\n\nHe attacks a ridiculous made-up figure to deflect from specific criticism of LLM use (that many probably wouldn’t even apply that strongly to his use case). But that’s not where criticism of LLMs comes from: It’s mostly specific focusing on the material properties of these systems, their production and use.\n\n“Refusing to use a technology because the people who developed it were indefensible creeps is a self-owning dead-end. You know what’s better than refusing to use a technology because you hate its creators? Seizing that technology and making it your own. Don’t like the fact that a convicted monopolist has a death-grip on networking? Steal its protocol, release a free software version of it, and leave it in your dust:”\n\nHere again Cory is misrepresenting the LLM-critic’s argument: Sam Altman is a scam artist and habitual liar, but that’s not one of the first 10 to 20 reasons people criticise OpenAI’s products. Sure, basically every leading figure in the “AI” space seems to be unpleasant at best but that’s true for most of tech TBH. People criticise LLMs for their structural properties, their material impacts, for the way they make it harder to learn and grow, for the way they make products worse while creating massive negative externalities in the form of emissions, water use and e-waste. For the way these systems can only be build by taking every piece of data – regardless of whether the authors consent or even explicitly refuse – and how the training needs ungodly amounts of harmful, exploitative labor done mostly by people in countries from the global majority. How it materially harms the commons.\n\nEven if OpenAI was run by decent, ethical, friendly, trustworthy people (which would then of course make them not work on the products OpenAI has, but it’s just a thought experiment) their products would need to be criticized for what they are and what they do. It’s really not about these few dudes running the companies.\n\nCory misrepresents the arguments (well basically hides them) in order to not have to face any material criticism and turns them into “you just don’t like these people” which frames the criticism as emotional and not rational. As if it was about not liking a bunch of rich men.\n\nHe then goes into how the path forward is to “steal the protocol”. His following paragraph goes into detail:\n\n“That’s how we make good tech: not by insisting that all its inputs be free from sin, but by purging that wickedness by liberating the technology from its monstrous forebears and making free and open versions of it”\n\nAnd here we are coming to the core of the problematic argument. Because Cory implicitly argues that technology is neutral and that one can just change its meaning and effect through usage. But as Langdon Winner argues in his famous essay “Do artifacts have politics” artifacts have built-in politics deriving from their structure. A famous example is the nuclear power plant: Due to the danger of these plants, their needs with regards to resources as well as security, power plants imply a certain form of political arrangement based on having a strong security force/army and a way to force these facilities (and facilities to store the waste in) upon communities potentially against their will.\n\nArtifacts and technologies have certain logics built into their structure that do require certain arrangements around them or that bring forward certain arrangements. The second aspect is often illustrated by how ships are organized: Because ships are sometimes in dangerous situations and sometimes critical decisions need to be made, the existence of ships implies the existence of a hierarchy of power relationships with a captain having the final say. Because democracy would be too slow at times. These politics are built into the artifact.\n\nUnderstanding this you cannot take any technology and “make it good”. Is a torturing device “good” if the plans on how to build it are creative commons? Do we need to answer the existence of the digital torment nexus by building an open source torment nexus? I’d argue we need to destroy it – regardless of what license it is released under.\n\nThat does not mean that it is impossible to take certain technologies or artifacts and try to reframe them, change their meaning. In some way computers are one such example: They were first used by governments, banks and other corporations to reach their goals but where then taken and reframed as devices intended to support personal liberation. It’s a bit more complicated (for why, dive into the late David Golumbia’s “The Cultural Logic of Computation”) but let’s give that one to Cory. Sure, sometimes it is possible to take something originally built for nefarious purposes and find better uses for it. But is that true for everything? Very obviously not.\n\nLet’s just look at the embedded politics of LLMs: In order to train a capable system you need data. Lots of it. AI companies keep buying books to scan them, they download everything from every legal or illegal source claiming “fair use” (a doctrine that only applies to the US by the way) or that “scraping is always okay”. Capable LLMs require a logic of dominance and of disregarding consent of the people producing the artifacts that are the raw material for the system. LLMs are based on extraction, exploitation and subjugation: To produce these systems – even if you release the end result as open weights for people to use at home – you need to take cultural works, personal writing etc. from people who not only not consented but actively reject that notion. The politics of LLMs is violence. How does one “liberate” that? What’s the case for open source violence?\n\nHe uses a so-called “open source LLM” and that’s very much how he presents his values but open-source LLMs do not really exist. You can download some weights but cannot understand what went into them or really change or reproduce them. Open source AI is just marketing and openwashing.\n\nCory shows his libertarian leanings here: If everything is somehow “free and open” then we have won. But “free and open” in this context usually means that “certain privileged groups have easy access to it and are not limited in what to do with it”. That’s one of the core problems with the whole “open Source” movement: That it reduces all struggle to if one can get their hands on the tools and has any restrictions to using them.\n\nThis also shines through in Cory arguing that we need to “liberate” technology. What a strange idea: Technology doesn’t need liberation, people do. Technologies are tools, not what we actually care about. Sure, sometimes technologies can play a role in liberating people but just as often “freeing” a technology does quite the opposite to people: Ask the women who have massive amounts of nonconsensually created sexualized images and videos generated of them whether they think that the “liberation” of stochastic images generators is liberating them? Technology doesn’t need to be free. It cannot be free because freedom as a concept applies to people.\n\nAnd freedom is not the only value that we care about. Making everything “free” sounds cool but who pays for that freedom? Who pays for us having for example access to the freedom an open weight LLM brings? Our freedom as users rests on the exploitation of and violence against the people suffering the data centers, labeling the data for the training, the folks gathering the resources for NVIDIA to build chips. Freedom is not a zero-sum game but a lot of the freedoms that wealthy people in the right (which I am one of) enjoy stem from other people’s lack thereof.\n\n“Purity culture is such an obvious trap, an artifact of the neoliberal ideology that insists that the solution to all our problems is to shop very carefully, thus reducing all politics to personal consumption choices:”\n\nCory labels people’s values and their prioritization as “purity culture” (referring back to the black and white strawman the started this part of his post with) and then pulls a really interesting spin here: Many people criticizing LLMs come from a somewhat leftist (in contrast to Cory’s libertarian) background. Cory intentionally frames those leftist thoughts that put politics based on values as “neoliberal ideology” that reduces “all politics to personal consumption choices”. This is clever narratively: Tell those stupid leftists that they are just neoliberals, the thing they hate! Awesome.\n\nBut the argument against using LLMs is not about shopping and markets at all. My not using LLMs does not influence anything in that regard, Microsoft will just keep making the data center go BRRRRRRR.\n\nIn a way this framing shows more about Cory’s thinking than about that of the people he criticises: Cory is focused on markets and market dynamics and in that world it’s about purchasing. But moral choices only sometimes relate to markets. They do when I for example choose only to buy fairly produced garments. But when I for example refused conscription (when I was young Germany still forced every young man to learn how to kill) that was not a shopping decision. That was politics as well as leading an ethical life.\n\nPeople do not believe that “not using LLMs” will solve the issue of OpenAI etc all existing. They do no want to build on, use products with so clearly defined harms and negative externalities. Because they believe it to be wrong. Sure, there might be a utilitarian argument for “the thing exists anyways and if it saves you time, that’s good, right” but many people are not utilitarians. They want to lead a life where they feel their actions align with their values. In a way that is a path to freedom: To having the freedom to make the decisions one feels are right are in alignment with one’s values.\n\nWhich Cory actually also believe and acts upon when it’s about his values: He has refused to create a Bluesky account in spite of wanting to be there cause his friends are there for (good!) ideological reasons: Because Bluesky was back then and honestly is still today mostly centralized with the Bluesky corporation having a central chokepoint to control the network. Cory believes that one sometimes needs to make decisions based on one’s values. He just does not think that your values as someone not wanting to use LLMs matter.\n\nI mean, it was extraordinarily stupid for the Nazis to refuse Einstein’s work because it was “Jewish science,” but not merely because antisemitism is stupid.\n\nEverybody hates Nazis. Implying that one is in any way like the Nazis is just a killer argument. But let’s talk about Nazis for a second. The Nazis did a lot of psychological and medical research. On people they interned and later killed in concentration camps. There actually was a massive debate within especially psychology whether using the results of that kind of research is ethically possible. Utilitarianism of course argues that if it’s there one should use it but especially when your whole discipline is focused on understanding how our psyche works in order to for example help people in trauma just taking research that has been created through unthinkable violence and torture feels wrong. Feels contrarian to what your whole discipline is there for. This reminds me of Ursula K. Le Guin’s story “The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas“: Omelas is an almost perfect city. Rich, democratic, pleasant. But it only works by having one small child in perpetual torment. Okay, but if that kid is already suffering because those other people chose to, should you walk away? Of just reap the fruits of that suffering?\n\nSometimes you need to walk away.\n\nCory then repeats the strawmen we already talked about and lands here:\n\n“It’s not “unethical” to scrape the web in order to create and analyze data-sets. That’s just “a search engine””\n\nAgain, he twists the argument in the way that the AI corporations like to do it as well: Search engines scour the web so AI companies should be allowed the same. It’s the same technology! But what’s the purpose?\n\nA search engine scrapes pages to build an “index” in order to let people find those pages. The scraping has value for the page and its owner as well because it leads to more people finding it and therefore connecting to the writer, journalist, musician, artist, etc. Search engines create connection.\n\nAI scrapers do not guide people towards the original maker’s work. They extract it and reproduce it (often wrongly). “AI”‘s don’t point out to the web for you to find other’s work to relate to, they keep you in their loop and give you the answer cutting off any connection to the original sources.\n\nWhile the technology of scraping is the same, the purpose and material effects of those two systems is massively different. Again, Cory misrepresents the critique and tries to make it look unreasonable by making it just a conversation about tech without regarding how that technology affects the world and the people in it.\n\nI appreciate a lot of work Cory Doctorow has done in the last decades. But the arguments he presents here to defend his usage of LLMs for this rather trivial task (which TBH could probably be done reasonably well with traditional means) are part of why the Internet – and therefore the world – looks like it does right now. It’s a set of arguments that wants to delegitimize political and moral actions based on libertarian and utilitarian thinking.\n\nTechnologies are embedded not only in their deployment but also in their creation, conceptualization. They carry the understanding of the world that their makers believe in and reproduce those. A bit like an LLM reproduces the texts it learned from: It might not always be a 100% identical replica but it’s structurally so similar that the differences are surface level.\n\nIn order to build an Internet and a world that is more inclusive, fairer, freer we need to move past the dogma of unchecked innovation and technology. We need to re-politicize our conversations about technology and their effects and goals in order to build the structures (technological, political, social) we want. The structures that lead to a conviviality in harmony with the planet we all live on and will live on till the end of our days.\n\nThat path is paved with discussions about political and moral values. Discussions about how certain technological artifacts do align with those values or not.\n\nI do agree with Cory that demanding perfect purity lead nowhere. We are imperfect people in an imperfect world. I just do not think that this means to go all accellerationalist. Just turning the “open source” dial up to 11 does not stop the apocalypse. It’s a lot harder.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.",

    "description": ": Watchdogs warn models that can generate realistic images of people must comply with data protection laws",
    "fullText": "A global coalition of privacy watchdogs has fired a warning shot at the generative AI industry, saying companies churning out realistic synthetic images can't pretend that data protection rules don't apply.\n\nThe joint statement [PDF] signed by more than 60 regulators, including the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), boils down to a simple point: if your model can convincingly fake a person, you don't get to pretend data protection law doesn't exist.\n\n\"Recent developments – particularly AI image and video generation integrated into widely accessible social media platforms – have enabled the creation of non-consensual intimate imagery, defamatory depictions, and other harmful content featuring real individuals,\" said the signatories. \"We are especially concerned about potential harms to children and other vulnerable groups, such as cyberbullying and/or exploitation.\"\n\nThe warning lands weeks after the ICO and DPC opened formal probes into Elon Musk's xAI following reports that its Grok chatbot produced sexual images of real people without their consent.\n\nThe group says organizations dabbling in generative AI need to build safeguards from the start and think carefully about risks such as non-consensual imagery, misuse of someone's likeness, and potential harms to children – all areas where the tech has raced ahead of social norms and, in some cases, common sense.\n\nThe regulators stress that the law already covers this, and that firms don't get a free pass just because the content came from a machine.\n\nWilliam Malcolm, executive director of Regulatory Risk & Innovation at the ICO, said: \"People should be able to benefit from AI without fearing that their identity, dignity or safety are under threat. AI already plays a large role in all our lives, and everybody has a right to expect that AI systems handling their personal data will do so with respect. Responsible innovation means putting people first: anticipating the risks and building in meaningful safeguards to ensure autonomy, transparency, and control.\n\n\"Public trust is foundational to the successful adoption and use of AI. Joint regulatory initiatives like this show global commitment to high standards of data protection in AI systems and help provide regulatory certainty. We expect those developing and deploying AI to act responsibly. Where we find that obligations have not been met, we will take action to protect the public.\"\n\nThe joint statement on AI-generated imagery suggests that if companies want to keep pushing ever more realistic AI into everyday products, they should expect regulators to keep asking awkward questions about how it all works. ®",

    "fullText": "A fiscal note on the proposed Chicago Bears stadium construction package shows northwest Indiana residents could pay millions in new taxes, which could grow with use by visitors to the region.\n\nThe statement — prepared by the nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency — still includes many unknowns but does provide some baseline revenue estimates for hospitality-related taxes.\n\nUnder Senate Bill 27, a state-crafted authority would take out bonds to build the stadium. A bevy of taxes would provide revenue to make the annual bond payments.\n\nThe exact cost of the project is unknown at this time though the Chicago Bears have committed $2 billion and House Speaker Todd Huston said Thursday in unveiling the plan that as much as $1 billion in public funding could be involved.\n\nThe bill allows Lake and Porter counties to each adopt a 1% food-and-beverage tax by June 30, 2027. Revenue from these taxes would go to the Northwest Indiana Stadium Board.\n\nIf both counties impose the 1% food-and-beverage tax, they could collect an estimated total of at least $12 million to $18 million annually, according to the fiscal estimate datedFriday. The estimate is based on the existing food services industry in each county and revenue collected in counties that currently impose such taxes.\n\nChicago Bears call Indiana deal ‘step forward’ for building new stadium in Hammond\n\n“The actual amount of revenue in Lake and Porter counties would likely be greater to the extent the stadium project results in increased demand for food and beverages,” it said.\n\nThe bill allows Lake County to increase the local hotel tax rate from its current 5% to 10%. The county council is required to adopt an ordinance increasing the tax rate by June 30, 2027.\n\nRevenue received from the hotel tax increase could be at least $5.4 million annually. But the statement says “the actual innkeeper’s tax revenue distributed to the board would likely be greater once the stadium and other facilities have been built.”\n\nHammond could also establish a 12% admissions tax on tickets for events held in the stadium. The tax is imposed on tickets offered for sale to the public at a box office or authorized agent, and does not apply to season tickets or a personal seat license.\n\nAll revenue collected would go to the Northwest Indiana Stadium Board to pay debt owed by the board.\n\nThe fiscal estimates the tax would generate around $12 million annually once the facility begins holding events. However, the revenue could be greater depending on the events that are held at the stadium.\n\nThe 10% Marion County admissions tax, which applies to events held at Lucas Oil Stadium, Victory Field, Gainbridge Fieldhouse and the Indiana Convention Center, generated $31.3 million during fiscal year 2025.\n\nAnother provision in the bill would create the Northwest Indiana Professional Sports Development Area. It could include any facility or complex of facilities that is used to hold a professional sporting event, including a stadium, parking garages, training facilities, and other related areas as specified in the bill.\n\nIt provides for allocation of covered taxes, including taxes paid for wages earned by athletes playing home games in a sporting facility, to the tax area. It defines covered taxes as state sales and use tax; individual income tax; local income tax; food and beverage taxes. Those revenues can be used for costs related to financing, construction, operating, maintaining and administration of the facilities established as part of the area.\n\nThe fiscal analysis said the total capture for the new tax area is unknown, but it will be less than the Marion County Professional Sports Development Area. That area — containing three sports facilities, a convention center and training facility — brings in over $16 million a year.\n\nOne final section of the bill allows dollars captured through a renegotiation of the Indiana Toll Road lease in 2026 to be used by the Indiana Finance Authority to pay or reimburse any costs associated with transportation and infrastructure projects in the following counties associated with the stadium relocation: Elkhart, LaGrange, Lake, LaPorte, Porter, Steuben and St. Joseph.\n\nAn information request with the IFA is currently pending concerning how much in revenue could be received from a renegotiation of the lease of the Indiana Toll Road, the fiscal report said.\n\nSenate Bill 27 is set for a second reading in the Indiana House on Monday and will be finalized by Friday, when this year’s legislative session is set to conclude.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",

    "title": "Russia’s Mi-28 Havoc Attack Helicopter Has Tiny Crew Compartment To Pick Up Downed Pilots",
    "description": "Like the Mi-24 Hind before it, albeit to a far more austere degree, the Mi-28’s fuselage compartment can be used in a pinch for rescues.",
    "fullText": "As well as being a key component of Russia’s attack helicopter force in the war in Ukraine, the Mi-28 Havoc has been in the news recently on account of its apparent delivery to Iran. Meanwhile, one lesser-known aspect of the Mi-28 is its ability to transport two or three passengers in a cramped fuselage compartment, a feature that is seen clearly in a recently published video of the rotorcraft.\n\nMi-28NM attack helicopter • Preflight Checks & Takeoff.\n[b/n \"05\" yellow?]\n\nVGTRK(Feb. 2026) https://t.co/F5sBjCQ3rBpic.twitter.com/0QRbVgQFSN\n\n— Massimo Frantarelli (@MrFrantarelli) February 23, 2026\n\nThe footage in question originates with the state-owned Russia Television and Radio channel and shows a Russian Aerospace Forces Mi-28NM — the latest domestic version of the gunship — undergoing pre-flight checks at a forward airstrip somewhere in the Ukrainian conflict zone. The video reportedly dates from this month.\n\nAt the start of the video, a technician is seen handling hoses that run into the helicopter’s port-side rear fuselage via an open door. Typically, such hoses are attached to dehumidifier units, which then blow warm, dry air through the aircraft to keep everything dry. This is especially important for sensitive avionics in cold weather, as on this snowy airfield. Once the helicopter is fully powered up, it should keep itself warm enough for moisture not to be a problem.\n\nWhat’s most interesting, however, is that the open door provides a rare look into this rear-fuselage compartment, which has the capacity to carry two or three people, or an equivalent load of cargo. Of course, this is in addition to the Mi-28’s two crew seated in tandem in the cockpit — the weapon system operator/navigator forward and the pilot to the rear.\n\nA look at the door armor on a Mi-28 attack helicopter.https://t.co/PTEzmFYUeY pic.twitter.com/wy6am7wkh2\n\n— Rob Lee (@RALee85) May 27, 2019\n\nThe fuselage compartment, unique among in-service attack helicopters, was part of the Mi-28’s design when it was first schemed back in the second half of the 1970s. The Soviet Union had ordered Mil to design a new-generation combat helicopter, equivalent to the U.S. AH-64 Apache, but this feature was all its own.\n\nThe Mi-28’s configuration was broadly similar to the AH-64, but marked a significant move away from the philosophy enshrined in the previous Mi-24 Hind. As we have discussed in the past, the Mi-24 had been built around a passenger/cargo cabin — with space for a squad of infantry — although, as it was developed, it expanded its anti-armor capabilities, too.\n\nA walkaround video of a privately owned Mi-24 in the United States. The passenger/cargo cabin is seen in detail from around the 11:30 mark:\n\nIn contrast, the Mi-28 was a tank-killer first and foremost, with no cabin, and better overall performance. However, there was internal space for a much smaller compartment and one that would be very useful for retrieving downed pilots from the battle area, especially for grabbing a pilot who went down within the same flight. Bearing in mind the expected aircraft losses on Europe’s Central Front — especially among low-flying helicopters — this made a lot of sense.\n\nOther tasks could have included moving mechanics and tools to conduct limited repairs of other helicopters in an emergency. Potentially, it could even have been used for inserting and picking up infiltrators or saboteurs.\n\nHaving the option of using the Mi-28 as a kind of ad-hoc, or non-traditional combat search and rescue (CSAR) asset would also mean that the aircraft could operate on its own and on the fly if other air or ground assets were not available. Traditionally, CSAR helicopters have to operate with an armed escort. It’s unknown whether the passenger cabin has been used at all in the war in Ukraine, but the limited space, presence of avionics equipment, and complete lack of windows mean it’s only really suited to emergencies. For more typical CSAR missions in the Ukrainian theater, Mi-8 Hips and Mi-24s are typically used, with an escort of Mi-28 or Ka-52 Hokum attack helicopters.\n\nAs for other attack helicopter types attempting personnel recovery, the best-known incident is likely that involving two British Army Apache gunships in Afghanistan in January 2007. During that dramatic mission, four Royal Marines strapped themselves to the outside of two Apaches for an attempted combat rescue. Ultimately, they were only able to recover the body of their fallen comrade, Lance Corporal Ford, who had already been killed.\n\nThe Italian Army, too, has explored the concept of using its A129 Mangusta attack helicopters for personnel rescue, strapping a pair of soldiers to the main landing gear struts. Meanwhile, the U.S. Army Special Operations Command operates MH-6M Little Birds with side-mounted planks to externally airlift special operators. A more elaborate modular system, used to transport small numbers of personnel, was schemed for the Bell 360 Invictus armed scout helicopter, as you can read about here.\n\nIt’s also worth pointing out another planned ‘survival’ feature of the Mi-28, namely its crew-escape system. Unlike the Ka-52, the Mi-28 doesn’t have ejection seats. Instead, the Zvezda/Tomilino Pamir-K crew seats have belts that tighten automatically when high-g loads are encountered. As originally envisaged, the crew escape system would work as follows. During any kind of catastrophic failure at altitude, the cockpit doors would be blown off, the stub wings would be jettisoned together with their loads, and an inflatable door-sill sleeve would be filled with air. This was to protect the crew from the protruding main landing gear and cannon and help them clear the helicopter, after which they would return to the ground by parachute. In theory, at least.\n\nKa-52 alligator and its unique K-37-800M ejection seats.

(@VladZinen) December 11, 2020\n\nIn practice, it seems the crew escape system never reached operational status on the Mi-28, likely due to the very limited window in which it would be of practical use.\n\nAccording to the Oryx open-source tracking group, Russia has lost 19 Mi-28s since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine four years ago. This figure could be higher because Oryx only tabulates losses it can confirm visually. Russia began the conflict with a force of around 110 Mi-28s of all versions.\n\nVideo of the destruction of the Mi-28 of the\n\nFPV drone. The first recorded case pic.twitter.com/LWosDeX2Ah\n\n(@front_ukrainian) August 7, 2024\n\nThe Mi-28 has had a notably protracted history since it was first flown in prototype form in 1982. The original Havoc was abandoned by the early 1990s, and Mil pressed ahead with the radar-equipped, night-capable Mi-28N version. Deliveries of production Mi-28N helicopters to Russia began in 2008, and export versions have since been sold to Algeria, Iraq, Uganda, and, apparently, now also Iran.\n\nNewly delivered Russian Mi-28NE attack helicopter was spotted over Tehran, Iran. pic.twitter.com/Mq5x9q4NHh\n\n— Clash Report (@clashreport) February 3, 2026\n\nFor Russia, the basic version remains the Mi-28N, which also undertook combat operations in Syria starting in 2016.\n\nLess common is the Mi-28UB (only 24 of which were produced), which received a mast-mounted radar, lacking on the Mi-28N, and dual controls. As for the latest Mi-28NM version — as seen in the video above — this also has the mast-mounted radar and other changes, including new missiles. As well as having been ordered in quantity for Russia, there are also plans to bring older Mi-28N aircraft up to Mi-28NM standard.\n\nVideo of the radar-equipped Mi-28UB during a live-fire exercise in the Krasnodar region, March 2020:\n\nFor all the changes that the Mi-28 has undergone since it first appeared, its highly compact passenger compartment remains one of its most unusual features.\n\nContact the author: thomas@thewarzone.com",

    "fullText": "PARIS (AP) — France's top diplomat Monday requested that U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner no longer be allowed direct access to members of the French government after he skipped a meeting to discuss comments by the Trump administration over the beating death of a far-right activist.\n\nFrench authorities had summoned Kushner to the Quai d'Orsay, which houses the Foreign Affairs Ministry, on Monday evening but he did not show up, according to diplomatic sources.\n\nJean-Noel Barrot, the foreign affairs minister, moved to restrict Kushner's access “in light of this apparent misunderstanding of the basic expectations of the mission of an ambassador, who has the honor of representing his country.”\n\nThe ministry, however, left the door open for reconciliation.\n\n“It remains, of course, possible for Ambassador Charles Kushner to carry out his duties and present himself at the Quai d’Orsay, so that we may hold the diplomatic discussions needed to smooth over the irritants that can inevitably arise in a friendship spanning 250 years,” it said.\n\nKushner had been summoned following a statement by the State Department’s Counterterrorism Bureau, which posted on X that “reports, corroborated by the French Minister of the Interior, that Quentin Deranque was killed by left-wing militants, should concern us all.” The U.S. Embassy had posted that statement on social media.\n\nDeranque, a far-right activist, died of brain injuries this month from a beating in the French city of Lyon. He was attacked during a fight on the margins of a student meeting where a far-left lawmaker was a keynote speaker.\n\nHis killing highlighted a climate of deep political tension ahead of next year’s presidential vote.\n\n“We reject any instrumentalization of this tragedy, which has plunged a French family into mourning, for political ends,” Barrot said over the weekend. “We have no lessons to learn, particularly on the issue of violence, from the international reactionary movement.”\n\nThe State Department said in its post that “violent radical leftism is on the rise and its role in Quentin Deranque’s death demonstrates the threat it poses to public safety. We will continue to monitor the situation and expect to see the perpetrators of violence brought to justice.”\n\nKushner was summoned in August over his letter to French President Emmanuel Macron alleging the country did not do enough to combat antisemitism. France’s foreign officials met with a representative of the U.S. ambassador since the diplomat did not show up.",

    "fullText": "Russia’s invasion of Ukraine four years ago launched Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II, causing immense suffering for civilians and harrowing ordeals for soldiers while rewriting the post-Cold War security order.\n\nThe fighting enters its fifth year on Tuesday, and it shows no signs of stopping anytime soon.\n\nThe U.S. has brokered talks with delegations from Moscow and Kyiv as part of the Trump administration's yearlong push for peace. But reconciling key differences, such as the future of Russian-occupied Ukrainian land and postwar security for Ukraine, has thwarted progress.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of each countries’ troops have died on the battlefield, and Ukrainian civilians have been battered by Russian aerial strikes that have brought years of power outages and water cuts.\n\nHere’s a look at the conflict, by the numbers, since the full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nThe upper end of the estimated number of soldiers killed, wounded or missing on both sides, according to a report last month by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank.\n\nIt estimated that Russia suffered 1.2 million casualties, including up to 325,000 troop deaths, between February 2022 and December 2025 — what it said was the largest number of troop deaths for any major power in any conflict since World War II.\n\nRussia has not released figures on battlefield deaths since January 2023, when it said more than 80 soldiers were killed in a Ukrainian strike, bringing the total military deaths Moscow has confirmed to just over 6,000.\n\nCSIS estimated that Ukraine has seen 500,000 to 600,000 military casualties, including up to 140,000 deaths.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this month that 55,000 Ukrainian troops have died in the war. Many are missing, he said.\n\nNeither Moscow nor Kyiv gives timely data on military losses. Independent verification is not possible.\n\nThe U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission’s count for civilian deaths in Ukraine since Russia’s all-out invasion, though it says that is likely an underestimate. More than 40,600 civilians were injured over the same period, it said in a December report.\n\nThe war has killed at least 763 children, according to the U.N.\n\nLast year was the deadliest for civilians in Ukraine since 2022. The conflict killed 2,514 civilians and injured 12,142 in the country in 2025 — a 31% increase in civilian casualties over 2024, it said.\n\nThe percentage of Ukrainian land occupied by Russia, according to the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nOver the past year, Russia has gained just 0.79% of Ukraine’s territory in the grinding war of attrition, the Washington-based think tank said in calculations provided earlier this month to The Associated Press, underscoring the little progress Moscow's forces have made despite huge costs in troops and armor.\n\nBefore Russia’s all-out invasion, it controlled nearly 7% of Ukraine, including Crimea and parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the east, as Moscow-backed separatists fought the Ukrainian army, according to Ukrainian officials and Western analysts.\n\nThe percentage drop in foreign military aid to Kyiv last year compared with the annual average between 2022 and 2024, according to Germany’s Kiel Institute, which tracks assistance to Kyiv.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump stopped sending American weapons paid for by the U.S. to Ukraine after he took office just over a year ago. European countries, striving to make up the difference, increased their military aid last year by 67% compared with the 2022-2024 period, the institute said in a report this month.\n\nForeign humanitarian and financial aid to Ukraine fell by 5% last year in comparison with the average in the previous three years, it said.\n\nThe number of Ukrainian civilians who have left their country.\n\nSome 5.3 million of those people have found refuge in Europe, according to a report this month from the U.N. office in Ukraine.\n\nAdditionally, around 3.7 million Ukrainians forced out of their homes have moved elsewhere within the country, the U.N. said in December.\n\nUkraine's prewar population was more than 40 million.\n\nThe number of Russian attacks that affected the provision of medical care in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion, according to a report from the World Health Organization on Monday.\n\nThere was a nearly 20% increase in such attacks last year compared with 2024, the U.N. agency said.\n\nA report earlier in the month from the WHO documented at least 2,347 strikes on health care facilities, in addition to others that damaged vehicles and the storage of medical supplies.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "Bitcoin price faces $60 billion whale selling pressure as consolidation persists, raising risks of breakdown toward $60,000 support levels.",
    "fullText": "Bitcoin price is consolidating after recent volatility, trading within a neutral structure. The crypto king has struggled to establish a decisive trend over the past two weeks.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin remains rangebound, reflecting balanced pressure between buyers and sellers. This equilibrium suggests that investor behavior from here will likely determine the next directional move.\n\nOn-chain data indicates that younger holders are choosing to HODL rather than exit positions. HODL waves show that the supply held by investors aged one to three months has declined by 5%. This supply has matured into the three- to six-month cohort, signaling reduced short-term selling.\n\nThis shift reflects improving holder resilience despite recent drawdowns. Bitcoin investors who remain underwater are not engaging in panic-driven liquidation. Instead, coins are aging into longer-term categories, which historically supports price stability. Reduced short-term distribution often limits downside volatility and strengthens structural support zones.\n\nWant more token insights like this? \n\nWhile some holders’ behavior appears stable, whale activity presents a contrasting dynamic. Since February 13, large holders have moved approximately 900,000 BTC, valued at $60 billion. This transfer activity suggests that significant capital may be preparing to exit positions following limited price appreciation.\n\nPersistent whale selling can introduce supply shocks, particularly in range-bound conditions. Large distributions increase overhead resistance and weaken bullish momentum. If critical holders grow increasingly impatient, sustained selling pressure could undermine BTC’s stability and elevate the probability of a broader correction.\n\nBitcoin is trading at $66,188 at the time of writing after slipping below the $67,394 support level. The asset remains confined between $65,000 and $70,000. This consolidation range reflects ongoing equilibrium. A decisive breakout or breakdown will likely define the next major move in Bitcoin price.\n\nOver the past two weeks, BTC has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern. Price action shows no clear directional bias. However, continued whale selling could tip the balance downward. A breakdown below the triangle support may send Bitcoin toward $64,142. Losing that level would expose BTC to a potential decline toward $60,000. Notably, a recent long lower wick signaled dip buying interest.",

    "fullText": "Feb 23 (Reuters) - Paramount Skydance submitted a higher offer for Warner Bros Discovery, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday, ratcheting up efforts to derail the HBO Max owner's deal with Netflix.\n\nThe bidding war for one of Hollywood's most coveted assets including the \"Harry Potter\" and \"Game of Thrones\" franchises has raised ‌the stakes for dominance in the streaming-led market.\n\nHow does Netflix's bid compare to Paramount's proposal?\n\nWhy is Warner Bros Discovery a coveted acquisition target?\n\nWhat regulatory challenges could block these merger deals?\n\nWhat are the key details of Paramount's revised offer?\n\nParamount's new bid — which improves its initial offer of $108.4 billion, or $30 per share, for the whole company — seeks to address Warner Bros ‌concerns about the certainty of its financing, the source said.\n\nWarner Bros' chosen suitor Netflix, which offered to buy ​the studios and streaming assets for $27.75 per share in cash, or $82.7 billion, is allowed to match the latest bid from David Ellison-led Paramount.\n\nNetflix has ample cash and could bump up its offer for HBO Max owner, while Paramount's rival bid is backed by Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison.\n\nThe CBS parent was asked to submit its \"best and final offer\" after Warner Bros rejected an enhanced bid that included paying the $2.8 billion in termination fee to Netflix and adding a 25-cent per share quarterly \"ticking fee\" from next year to compensate Warner Bros shareholders for any delay in deal closure.\n\nWarner Bros had said Paramount's February 10 offer still falls short ‌of what its board would consider a superior proposal and gave ⁠a seven-day deadline until February 23 to submit a revised offer.\n\nMoffettNathanson analysts had earlier said that an offer in the range of $34 per share from Paramount would end the bidding war and \"avoid further debate over Discovery Global's value.\"\n\nWarner Bros plans to spin off Discovery Global, which holds cable TV assets such as ⁠CNN and HGTV, could fetch between $1.33 and $6.86 a share, according to Warner Bros estimates.\n\nNetflix said its offer gives Warner Bros shareholders added upside from the Discovery Global spinoff, which WBD argues will add value by giving the new company greater strategic, operational and financial flexibility.\n\nHowever, Paramount has said the cable spinoff central to the streaming giant's offer is effectively worthless.\n\nThe David Zaslav-led Warner Bros came under pressure from Ancora Capital after the activist investor ​built ​a roughly $200 million stake in the HBO owner and accused the company of failing to adequately engage with ​Paramount.",

    "description": "A harrowing fall while skiing in the backcountry of Japan complicated Kate Johnson's pregnancy in aggravating ways.",
    "fullText": "It was supposed to be peak relaxation.\n\nKate Johnson and her husband, Sean, planned a 10-day ski vacation to Japan early last year. They figured it would be their last big trip for a while since they were trying to get pregnant.\n\nA few weeks before boarding the plane, the Hoboken couple found out they were expecting.\n\n“I weighed my options on being able to ski and figured that so early on in the pregnancy, it wouldn’t have that much of an effect,” Johnson, 38, told The Post. “Little did I know how that was going to turn out.”\n\nSpoiler alert: It went downhill fast. A harrowing fall while skiing in the backcountry of Japan complicated Johnson’s pregnancy in aggravating ways — and underscored how difficult it can be for pregnant women’s health concerns to be taken seriously.\n\nJohnson’s tumble came on her second day of skiing in the area of Nagano, the site of the 1998 Winter Olympics. She and Sean were being led by a guide up and down a mountain and throughout a nearby valley.\n\n“The second run down, I just caught like an edge. I got a little bit too much speed, and I sort of fell backwards,” the digital retail sales specialist recalled.\n\n“And when that happened, I sort of heard this pop,” she continued. “I don’t fall that often, so I didn’t really know exactly what was happening.”\n\nJohnson — who began skiing at 4 years old — tried to get her bearings. She was startled to hear a “massive cracking sound” in her right knee when she pulled her boot back on.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, she had fallen in an avalanche zone, so a helicopter came to dramatically rescue her.\n\nJohnson landed in a nearby hospital, where doctors suspected a patellar tendon injury but didn’t perform an MRI. Many doctors avoid MRIs in the first trimester as a precaution, even though there are no proven harmful effects on the fetus.\n\nJohnson was given “an enormous brace” and crutches to navigate the rest of her dream vacation.\n\nOnce she got back to the States, the real nightmare began.\n\nAt home in New Jersey, she struggled to find a doctor who would fix the problem.\n\nShe had to jump through hoops just to get an MRI, which revealed a full rupture of her ACL and a tear in her meniscus, the cartilage pad in the knee that absorbs shock and provides stability.\n\nMost of the 15 to 20 doctors she contacted suggested she wait until after she delivered to undergo surgery — but Johnson was ready to move forward.\n\n“[I] have a history of depression, anxiety and disordered eating, so movement is super important to me [for] regulating myself,” she explained.\n\nShe finally came upon Dr. Abigail Campbell, co-director of the NYU Langone Center for Women’s Sports Medicine.\n\nWhile some surgeons may postpone non-emergency procedures on pregnant women due to the potential risks of anesthesia, Campbell was game to do the procedure.\n\n“Like many things in pregnancy, [anesthesia] is one of those things that there has been minimal data on, so when unsure, it is assumed that it may not be safe in pregnancy,” Campbell told The Post.\n\n“However, there have been several studies in the past few years come out in the orthopedic trauma literature regarding safe practices and safe outcomes for surgery (for orthopedic injuries) in pregnant individuals.”\n\nJohnson’s medical team decided to perform the surgery when she was about 16 weeks along.\n\n“The second trimester is preferred for elective procedures in pregnant patients because of the confounding risk of spontaneous abortion (which is elevated in the first trimester) and the risk of preterm labor (which is higher in the third trimester),” Campbell noted.\n\nThe operation required a single X-ray, which confirmed that Johnson had actually torn the other meniscus in her right knee as well because her knee was so unstable.\n\nTo capture that image, Campbell and Johnson each had to wear two layers of lead aprons to protect their fetuses from radiation.\n\nCampbell, herself, was pregnant with a girl at the time.\n\n“Normally, surgeons wear one layer of lead aprons during surgery,” Campbell said. “On my end, wearing two layers of lead just made me hot during the procedure, but I had to do this all the time! Got used to it.”\n\nJohnson was given spinal anesthesia for the ACL reconstruction and meniscus repairs. The entire ordeal took over 90 minutes, during which Johnson’s baby was monitored to make sure he was OK.\n\nPost-procedure, Johnson had scar tissue and a couple of nights of restless leg syndrome to contend with, but her recovery went “surprisingly” well. That’s good news since she eschewed painkillers throughout the pregnancy.\n\nJohnson gave birth to son Brody on Oct. 3 — he clocked in at a healthy 6 pounds, 8 ounces.\n\n“Now it’s just a matter of building up the muscles that have sort of atrophied through non-use on both knees at this point,” Johnson said.\n\nFor her part, Campbell gave birth in July to daughter Louise.\n\nShe’s proud of Johnson’s recovery and her persistence in getting a variety of medical opinions.\n\n“Truly elective surgery, like cosmetic surgery, are not recommended, but in situations like this, in which waiting could result in long-term irreversible joint damage, the benefits outweigh the risks,” Campbell said about surgery while pregnant.\n\nAnd the whole misadventure hasn’t given Johnson cold feet for skiing.\n\n“I’m really lucky that this year the snow is so terrible that I’m not having horrible FOMO, but I’m already thinking about next year — when we can get back out and when we can get Brody on skis,” she confessed.",

    "fullText": "TORONTO (AP) — Canada announced Monday that it is working on an aid package for Cuba as it faces blackouts and severe fuel shortages worsened by a U.S oil embargo.\n\nForeign Minister Anita Anand declined to give details beyond that.\n\n“We are preparing a plan to assist. We are not prepared at this point to provide any details of the announcement,” Anand said.\n\nCuba is facing an increasingly dire energy crisis that has heightened in recent weeks after oil shipments from Venezuela, its main oil supplier, were halted when the U.S. attacked the South American country in early January and arrested its leader. Mexico, another major supplier, then also suspended oil shipments under U.S. pressure.\n\nAir Canada and other airlines have canceled flights to the Caribbean island because of a shortage of aviation fuel on the island.\n\nCanadian tourism is vital to Cuba’s economy. Global Affairs Canada, a governmental office, has said Canada is Cuba’s second-largest source of direct investment to the island, particularly in the mining and tourism sectors.\n\nCanada would join Mexico in providing aid.\n\nTwo Mexican Navy ships laden with humanitarian aid docked in Cuba earlier this month, two weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on countries that sell oil to the island, deepening an already severe economic and energy crisis in the Caribbean nation. The ships brought about 800 tons of goods, and another 1,500 tons of powdered milk and beans.\n\nThe economic crisis gripping Cuba since 2020 has been compounded by intensified U.S. sanctions aimed at forcing a change in the island’s political model. These pressures led to critical shortages and severe blackouts that peaked in early 2026.\n\nBecause Cuba produces only 40% of its required fuel, it remains highly vulnerable to external blockades. While strong allies like Russia and China have condemned the U.S. measures, their support has remained largely symbolic thus far.\n\nFollow AP’s Latin America coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

    "description": "With the Colorado River shrinking and its water rights in flux, the Central Arizona Project has assembled a coalition to campaign for its share.",
    "fullText": "A Central Arizona Project-backed advocacy group called the Coalition for Protecting Arizona’s Lifeline has begun rolling out television ads and online videos defending the water supplier’s rights to a Colorado River that is under serious hydrological and political strain.\n\n“Arizona is being unfairly targeted for reductions of Colorado River water that would cripple our state, flatten our economy and weaken our nation’s defense,” an ad aired by the coalition warns. It goes on to note that Arizona communities have done their part, committing more water for conservation in Lake Mead than those in other states, and that several options that the federal government is weighing for managing the river would fall hardest on the state.\n\nOne such alternative under review, CAP General Manager Brenda Burman recently said, would essentially dry up the agency’s canal from the river to Phoenix and Tucson.\n\n“In that alternative, they proposed to take us off the map,” she said. Three other alternatives do less harm to CAP. The agency has rejected all as unfairly penalizing Arizona while demanding much less from upstream states in particular.\n\nThe alternatives Burman was referring to were never stated as the Trump administration’s preference, but rather as ideas from which the seven states that share the river water might draw from in writing an agreement for sharing in its worsening shortages. Now that the states have failed to reach such an agreement, though, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is faced with either enacting something like them or rapidly developing a new federal plan in time to replace river guidelines that expire this autumn.\n\nNatural re\n\nIn normal times before the last quarter-century of drought, CAP was entitled to 1.6 million acre-feet of water — each acre-foot equating to roughly 326,000 gallons and enough to support about three households for a year. In those plentiful times Arizona took some of that water and sunk it in the ground for future use.\n\nIn recent years, Lake Mead's loss of stored water has forced CAP to forego more than 500,000 acre-feet a year. Worse cutbacks are on the horizon, but just how dry the canal will go depends on what rules the federal government imposes.\n\nAnticipating a fight, CAP formed the coalition last summer, announcing that discussions with the mayors of Phoenix, Tucson, Mesa and Surprise had led to its creation. Two dozen other mayors ultimately joined, along with leaders of several commerce groups and Native American tribes.\n\nThe coalition’s website and ads ask Arizonans to pledge their support for the effort to protect CAP water. The group has posted numerous video testimonials from members.\n\n“If there are major cuts or changes in how Colorado River water is allocated, the impacts on our communities and the entire state could be devastating,” Casa Grande Mayor Lisa Fitzgibbons said in one such testimonial. “That’s why Arizona and cities like Casa Grande are taking proactive steps to protect our water future,” including by a city demand management program.\n\nWhile the materials don’t directly state members’ intended method of securing water, some of the videos lean heavily on the so-called Law of the River and its guarantee of water from the four headwaters states to Arizona, California and Nevada. This theme reiterates a point that CAP and Arizona water officials have stressed over the last year or so, that if push comes to shove in a legal battle, they have the 1922 Colorado River Compact on their side.\n\nWater shortages: Without a deal on the Colorado River, deeper cuts loom. How 9 Arizona cities will respond\n\nTwo river tutorial videos note that the compact awarded the three states of the Lower Basin 7.5 million acre-feet of water per year on average plus half of the smaller U.S. obligation to Mexico, and stated that the Upper Basin states would not deplete the river flow below that level.\n\nTwentieth century negotiators from the Upper Basin conceded the point out of fear that California and Arizona could otherwise claim most of the river due to their earlier use of the water, according to the videos. In wet years the Upper Basin could use up to 7.5 million acre-feet itself, but in dry years it would allow at least that much to flow to the more developed Southwestern cities and farm districts.\n\n“This was an obligation,” a narrator states, “meaning a guarantee.”\n\nRead more Colorado River stories: \n\nThat’s a point that modern negotiators for the Upper Basin states have disputed, saying that the Lower Basin continues to use most of the water while it’s climate change rather than their own consumption that has reduced the supply.\n\n“We do not have a delivery obligation under the terms of the compact,\" Colorado state river commissioner Becky Mitchell said last year during a meeting of the Upper Colorado River Commission, \"and will not agree to impose one on ourselves through agreement now.\"\n\nAs states gear up for a potential showdown in court, CAP and its Coalition for Protecting Arizona’s Lifeline are making clear that they will demand compact compliance if other states don’t cut their uses sufficiently.\n\n“The Colorado River Compact isn’t just history,” one of the videos asserts. “It’s the foundation of Western water law. And it still dictates how the West shares its most important resource — water.”\n\nBrandon Loomis covers environmental and climate issues for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com.

    "description": "Whoopi Goldberg wonders if maybe the FBI wanted Patel out of the country for a bit simply so they could get work done without him",
    "fullText": "The hosts of “The View” were largely disgusted by video footage showing FBI director Kash Patel partying with the U.S. men’s Olympic hockey team in Milan this weekend, but Whoopi Goldberg offered a more “positive” spin on it. The ABC moderator suggested that maybe the FBI told Patel to go, simply to get him out of the way.\n\nIn the footage, Patel is seen celebrating in the locker room with the victorious U.S. team on Sunday, yelling and drinking. But, a spokesperson for the FBI insisted Patel was in Milan on official business, and that’s why he used a taxpayer-funded plane to get there. His trip to the Olympics just happened to coincide.\n\n“Maybe the folks in the FBI said ‘Yeah Kash, go do that,’ so they don’t have to deal with him,” Whoopi suggested on Monday. “Because they know he doesn’t know what he’s doing. They know that he is incompetent, they know he’s just — he’s a joke. And he’s a joke to the rest of the world, and because, for most of the people working in the FBI, it is not a joke, they’re the ones whose eyes are on the ball.”\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the women at the table weren’t so optimistic. Host Ana Navarro was quick to remind viewers that Patel has been accused of misusing the FBI plane before, and that he wasn’t the only one.\n\n“The bottom line is these people have no care about wasting taxpayer money, and they behave — I don’t even know what Kash Patel was doing there,” she said.\n\nBeyond the use of taxpayer money, the optics of Patel’s trip bothered host Sara Haines more, considering how many things are going on in this country.\n\n“Right now, the world doesn’t feel settled or stable, and you’ve got the head of the FBI, and the visual of chugging a beer in a locker room,” she said. “I just think it doesn’t — he’s already under scrutiny for a thousand reasons, because this administration has not been the defining of competence.”\n\n“So I think when you have someone like that, with all that’s going on, and then that’s what you see, I just think it’s a bit of an insult to the American people,” Haines continued.\n\nHaines lamented that she misses the days when FBI directors weren’t so prominent, which prompted guest host Amanda Carpenter to explain why that was the case and precisely why she was so bothered by the footage as well.\n\n“The reason we don’t see them is because they’re usually busy,” she said. “There’s a lot of things to do. And god forbid something happens, and it could’ve been prevented, and it wasn’t because he was concerned about hanging around in the men’s hockey locker room.”\n\n“The View” airs weekdays at 11 a.m. ET on ABC.\n\nThe post ‘The View’: Whoopi Wonders If FBI Told Kash Patel to Go to the Olympics ‘So They Don’t Have to Deal With Him’ appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "While the Big Mac has been McDonald's premium sandwich for over 50 years, it wasn't on the menu when the chain opened its first restaurant in 1940.\n\nBack then, the idea of a premium burger conflicted with the broader concept of having a simple menu that could be delivered quickly. Back in those early days, the chain focused on a simple offering of burgers, cheeseburgers, fries, and sodas.\n\nIt was actually 27 years later when the chain's corporate leaders gave Michael James “Jim” Delligatti, a franchise operator, permission to launch a burger with two patties.\n\n\"The Big Mac made its debut on April 22 in 1967. According to The New York Times, the first newspaper ads for the specialty sandwich described it as a burger with 'two freshly ground patties, tangy melted cheese, crisp lettuce, pickle, and our own Special Sauce.' Early printed ads also often included the catch phrase 'A meal disguised as a sandwich,' to emphasize the burger’s size,\" Food & Wine reported.\n\nThe Big Mac was a hit that went on to become the chain's enduring signature offering. Since 1967, however, McDonald's has tried many times to create new signature, premium burgers, and aside from the Quarter Pounder with Cheese, the chain has failed many times.\n\nDespite failures like the Arch Deluxe, and Angus Third Pounders, McDonald's has decided to launch a new premium burger, the Big Arch.\n\nCFO Ian Borden has talked about why the company has struggled with higher-end offerings in the past.\n\n“We thought the opportunity was about premium burgers, which was wrong,” he said at a UBS Global Consumer and Retail Conference in 2024, Business Insider reported. “We weren’t successful.”\n\nInstead, he noted, customers want a larger, more satisfying burger. The Big Arch, which launches March 3, will attempt to meet that demand.\n\nMcDonald's will launch the Big Arch at a time when consumers are seeking value and when rivals, including Chipotle, have leaned into the added-protein trend.\n\n\"Protein is hot. Everybody is into protein,” McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski said in an Instagram video.\n\nIn addition to Chipotle's protein menu, Starbucks has added protein-infused coffees, and many chains are promoting protein on their menus.\n\nChipotle’s new consumer strategy raises eyebrows\n\nBurger King revives iconic kids’ meal toys after 22 years\n\nWalmart surprises shoppers with bold new restaurant offering\n\nThis year, 28.4% of U.S. restaurant menus call out “protein,” up from 5.9% a decade ago, according to Datassential, CNBC reported.\n\n“A lot of younger consumers are more proactive about their health habits, so they’re looking for ways to support health now but also to support their health in the future,” said Julia Mills, a food and drink analyst for market research firm Mintel told the news site.",

    "description": "The proposed legislation would revise the state’s criminal code to charge abortion patients with fetal homicide, a crime punishable by life imprisonment, life without parole, or, yes, the death penalt...",
    "fullText": "In a wildly ridiculous case of GOP lawmakers wanting to make everything about ultimately banning abortion and punishing abortion patients, two (he/him) lawmakers in Tennessee have proposed a bill that would charge abortion patients with homicide.\n\nRep. Jody Barrett (R) and Sen. Mark Pody (R) have introduced House Bill 570 and Senate Bill 738, which, if passed, would revise the state’s criminal code to charge abortion patients with fetal homicide. Some media outlets have highlighted that this could mean abortion patients could receive the death penalty, which Rep. Barrett denies. But even though it’s true that their bill doesn’t explicitly mention the death penalty, punishment for fetal homicide can include life imprisonment, life without parole, or, yes, the death penalty.\n\nThe bill also removes protection for pregnant people. For the most part, states with abortion bans look to punish the doctor, healthcare provider, or anyone who helps someone get an abortion, not the abortion seeker themselves. But HB 570 and SB 738 would consider any harm done to a fetus as harm done to an individual “born alive” or, in other words, prioritize protections for a fetus over the pregnant person carrying them.\n\nWhile the bill has yet to be voted on, it would take effect on July 1 if it passes—though it would not apply to any cases before then.\n\nA post shared by AGirlHasNoPresident (@agirlhasnopresident)\n\nThe legislation was initially announced by anti-abortion group Foundation to Abolish Abortion (FAA), and was endorsed by the Southern Baptist Convention—or the same denomination that made headlines in 2019 for overlooking and enabling a system of church leaders who raped, molested, and abused hundreds of victims. It was also backed by Reps. Bud Hulsey (R), Ed Butler (R), and Monty Fritts (R)—the latter of whom defended the bill by telling the Tennessee Holler in late January that “murder is murder. I know that’s hard for people to hear, and I don’t mean to be hard with it, I promise.”\n\nTennessee is one of 13 states with a near-total abortion ban, and also considered one of the strictest bans in the country—while it has a vague exception for the life of the mother, the ban has zero exceptions for rape or incest. In July, one doctor also used the states newly-passed Medical Ethics Defense Act to deny a pregnant woman prenatal care because she was unmarried.\n\nSo far in 2026, three states, in addition to Tennessee, have tried to advance legislation aiming to classify abortion as murder. Ten states tried (and failed) to do the same in 2025. It’s a risky move for the GOP ahead of the midterms—as abortion rights remain overwhelmingly popular in the U.S. But if they want to dig their own grave, they have our blessing to shovel away.\n\nLike what you just read?

    "fullText": "Are aliens real? The question has animated conspiracy theories for decades and enthralled at least one former president of the United States. In a recent interview, Barack Obama became the first American president to affirm a belief in the existence of extraterrestrial life, but insisted that it was not being stored inside the top-secret Area 51 military base in Nevada.\n\nFor Bill Diamond, the president and chief executive of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute (Seti) in California, Obama’s beliefs are hardly radical. Seti is the world’s leading research organisation dedicated to the scientific search for life beyond our planet – and Diamond insists that aliens are out there.\n\n“Oh yes,” says the 69-year-old scientist. “I do believe aliens are real. Definitely… It is one of the questions we ask if you want to get a job at Seti. If you don’t believe in aliens, there’s probably no point having a job with us.” Diamond’s job involves overseeing teams of scientists working on various projects and sifting through torrents of data from radio telescopes, searching for patterns that nature alone cannot explain.\n\nDiamond is careful, though, to draw distinctions in what he means by aliens. He is not talking about flying saucers and abductions. “Life is probably very common in the universe,” he says. “It’s when you start talking about complex organisms, intelligence and then, ultimately, technology that it becomes a different matter.\n\n“The conditions that would allow for [aliens] to exist, which are mostly time and evolution, are probably not going to be as common as the conditions that allow just basic cellular life to emerge. But statistically speaking, there will be many examples of intelligent and ultimately technological life on other worlds.”\n\nSo if they do exist, what will they look like? Public imagination of aliens in film and fiction are of little men flying through our skies in spaceships and etching elaborate patterns into wheat fields. Diamond smiles at the cliché. Reality, he believes, is both less theatrical and far harder to picture.\n\n“It’s very hard for us to imagine what aliens would be like,” he says, but points to the biodiversity of our own planet which may offer clues. Aliens may even be similar to creatures like jellyfish, he suggests. “We have jellyfish that, from my point of view, are pretty extraordinary looking, a bit like aliens – and various sea creatures and birds and reptiles and mammals and so forth.” On Earth alone, evolution has produced creatures that seem almost otherworldly. Octopuses with nervous systems that extend into their arms, whales capable of complex communication. If such diversity exists under one sky, perhaps it’s not so difficult to imagine stranger things still under another.\n\nThe same physical laws apply everywhere, Diamond notes. Gravity, chemistry and energy behave the same way across the known universe. This does not mean that aliens would look human but it does mean that they would be shaped by similar constraints. “They will obviously be shaped by their environment. A bigger planet than Earth is going to have a stronger gravitational field that’s going to require an organism that is capable of withstanding that gravitational pull so likely to be a more robust physical species. A planet slightly smaller would have a lower gravitational field that might allow for more spindly, less structurally solid beings.”\n\nSo if aliens do exist, how would they get in touch? Diamond is clear about what he does not expect. “I think crop circles are rather unlikely,” he says. “If you’re an advanced civilisation, and you are able to be here in some capacity, having a presence or impact on our planet and you wanted to get our attention or have the technology to visit Earth in some direct or impactful way, you have technology far beyond our ability to imagine.”\n\nSuch a civilisation would not stumble upon us. It would already know we were here. It would have studied our atmosphere, our radio signals. It would understand our level of technology and, almost certainly, our languages, Diamond says.\n\nInstead, he believes that contact is far more likely to come as a signal. “First contact is most certainly going to be an observation of a phenomena that nature doesn’t produce, that we can say that’s technology,” he says. “Certainly, if an advanced civilisation wanted to get in touch or contact us, radio transmission would be one of the most efficient and effective ways.”\n\nHowever, he jokes that even if aliens could contact us, they might not want to. “There is a joke amongst some researchers,” he says. “When alien spacecraft fly by the Earth, they lock the doors.”\n\nAt Seti, Diamond describes three ways that scientists search for life. The first is “in situ” exploration, sending instruments directly to a place of interest. Nasa’s Perseverance rover is currently exploring Mars to determine whether life exists or once existed there. That approach, for now, is limited to our own solar system. The second is remote observation. The James Webb Space Telescope can examine the atmospheres of distant planets up to around 1,000 light years away. The third is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence itself, though Diamond prefers a more precise description. What Seti is really seeking, he says, is extraterrestrial technology, something that acts as a proxy for life and intelligence.\n\nSo, when might all of this happen? “A Seti discovery could happen tomorrow, it might not happen for a thousand years, we don’t know,” Diamond says. “But one of the things we also say in this business is that the probability for finding life beyond Earth if you don’t look for it is zero.”\n\nThe challenge, he explains, is scale. If a signal was sent from Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to our solar system, it would only take four years to get here. Yet if an alien civilisation 1,000 light years away sent a message today, it would not reach us for 10 centuries. If we replied, our response would take just as long. Therefore, any exchange would unfold across generations rather than lifetimes.\n\nThat does not dampen his optimism. Humanity has been technologically capable for barely a century. In that time, we have gone from inventing radio to building space telescopes that can study worlds hundreds of light years away. Given enough time, our reach will expand.\n\nA confirmed detection would be historic. Diamond and his colleagues are already thinking about what it would mean. What will that discovery do to humanity as we know it? Change it for the better, Diamond hopes.\n\n“Whatever the nature of the discovery, almost certainly it will have an impact on us,” he says. “How will it impact religious beliefs and how will it impact governments and international diplomacy?”\n\nFor a man who spends his days contemplating vast distances and civilisations he may never see, the conclusion is strikingly human. “I hope we will be excited by the news and not threatened by it. Maybe people would finally realise we are all on this one planet as one little island and in this together so it might be smart for us to co-operate instead of fighting with each other.”\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "title": "I Ate a Banana Every Day for a Week and Here’s What Happened to My Body",
    "description": "As a dietitian, I know bananas are healthy. But what would happen if I decided to eat a banana every day for a week? Find out here.",
    "fullText": "As a dietitian, I know the importance of nutrition. Fruits, including bananas, provide essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber our bodies need. Despite this, I will admit that there are days when I don’t quite meet my own fruit quota. So in an effort to up my intake, I decided to challenge myself to eat a banana every day for a week.\n\nIf you’re like me, bananas are probably one of those foods you don’t think twice about. It’s easy to grab when running out the door, sweet enough to feel like a treat, and tasty in recipes from smoothies to banana bread. It would be simple to eat one every day, right? Here’s how my week with bananas unfolded and what I learned along the way.\n\nBefore getting started, I reflected on how often bananas naturally made an appearance in my diet. I realized that while I wasn’t eating them daily, I did enjoy them in several forms—blended into smoothies, sliced over yogurt, or spread with peanut butter as a quick snack. I figured eating one each day wouldn’t be difficult, and I was curious to see if I’d notice any tangible benefits.\n\nOver the next several days, I made a point to eat a banana a day. And honestly, it was easy to do, thanks in large part to the fact that bananas don't need to be refrigerated. Running to my car, I grabbed a banana to hang onto for when hunger pangs hit, and I was so happy I had it with me when I got hungry. One day for dessert, I sliced a banana over Icelandic Provisions salted caramel and banana skyr (tastes like banana pudding). And another day, I leaned on a classic peanut butter, banana, and honey sandwich at lunchtime. It required very little effort to add a banana to my days.\n\nAs the week went on, I noticed some pleasant changes. My energy levels felt steadier, especially during the busy mid-morning hours when I’d usually start searching for a quick pick-me-up. Bananas gave me a satisfying boost without the jitters or crash I sometimes get from sugary snacks. I felt more satisfied and less likely to reach for less healthy options.\n\nDigestively, things seemed to move along more smoothly, too. While the difference wasn’t extreme, it was certainly positive. I didn’t feel bloated like I do on occasion, and my bowel movements were regular. Plus, having that daily banana seemed to curb my sweet tooth, so I wasn’t tempted by mid-afternoon sweets as much. Overall, it was a simple change that left me feeling good!\n\nBananas are nutritional powerhouses. A medium-sized banana is considered a single serving. Here’s the breakdown of what you get in one medium banana:\n\nBananas also deliver plenty of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that deliver scientifically-backed benefits. Some of the most impressive ones include:\n\nPotassium is a critical nutrient that supports heart health and helps maintain proper blood pressure. One medium banana provides about 375 milligrams of potassium, making it a great way to meet your daily needs of about 2,600–3,400 milligrams. If you struggle with muscle cramps after workouts or occasional fatigue, adequate potassium intake might help ease those symptoms.\n\nBananas are an excellent source of dietary fiber, with one medium banana providing about 3 grams of fiber. Fiber plays a significant role in supporting regular bowel movements and promoting healthy gut bacteria. What’s more, slightly underripe bananas offer a unique benefit: They’re a source of prebiotic fiber. Prebiotic fiber feeds the “good” bacteria in your gut, which supports a healthy digestive system and can improve overall gut health.\n\nOne medium banana contains about 0.4 milligrams of vitamin B6, which is roughly 25% of the daily recommended intake for adults. The benefits of vitamin B6 are vast, but it particularly supports brain health, aiding the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine that regulate mood.\n\nBananas are predominantly made up of carbohydrates, with about 27 grams per medium banana. Thanks to their natural sugars and the fiber they contain, bananas provide a steady source of energy, making them ideal before a workout or as a pick-me-up snack.\n\nBananas contain several antioxidants, including vitamin C. Antioxidants help neutralize free radicals in the body, reducing oxidative stress and potentially lowering the risk of certain chronic diseases.\n\nBecause bananas are about 75% water, they contribute to your overall hydration. Combining their potassium content with this water content makes them a fantastic post-workout snack to help replenish lost electrolytes and fluids.\n\nWhile bananas are packed with nutrients, like any food, they’re best enjoyed in moderation. Eating too many bananas in a short timeframe may result in an overload of certain nutrients, such as potassium. Though this is rare, too much potassium (a condition called hyperkalemia) can lead to issues like heart irregularities if your kidneys can’t process the excess properly, or even dialysis.\n\nFor most people, eating one to two bananas a day is perfectly safe. If you focus on a balanced diet with a variety of fruits, it prevents overdoing any one thing.\n\nAnother thing to consider is bananas’ carbohydrate and sugar content. If you’re monitoring your blood sugar closely, be mindful of your portion size and pair bananas with some protein or fat, like almond butter or yogurt, to help support healthy blood glucose levels.\n\nBananas do make an excellent grab-and-go snack, but there are also many other easy and delicious ways to enjoy them on a regular basis. Here are some that I recommend:\n\nSmoothies: Slice a banana and toss it into your blender with yogurt, milk, and your favorite fruits for a quick breakfast or snack.\n\nOn toast: Pair banana slices with nut butter on whole grain toast for a filling, balanced meal.\n\nDesserts: Freeze ripe bananas to make creamy “nice cream” as a healthier alternative to ice cream.\n\nBaking: Use mashed bananas in recipes like banana bread or muffins for natural sweetness.\n\nToppings: Add sliced bananas to your cereal, oatmeal, or yogurt for some extra flavor and nutrients.\n\nAfter eating a banana every day for a week, I can confidently say that incorporating a banana into your daily routine comes with some impressive benefits. They’re convenient, affordable, and packed with essential nutrients like vitamins B6 and C that can boost energy, support digestion, and enhance overall health.\n\nThat said, balance and variety are key. I enjoy a wide range of fruits every day, including bananas, to ensure a diverse mix of nutrients. For those who don’t eat fruit regularly but enjoy bananas, they’re a simple, delicious, and budget-friendly way to start adding more nutrition to your diet. This versatile fruit truly punches above its weight!\n\nCan Apple Cider Vinegar Lead to Weight Loss?\n\nBobbi Brown Shares Her Top Face-Transforming Makeup Tips for Women Over 50",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Nick Reiner, the 32-year-old son of Hollywood luminary Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner, pleaded not guilty Monday to two counts of first-degree murder more than two months after their deaths, denying for the first time that he fatally stabbed his parents.\n\nReiner’s attorney, Deputy Public Defender Kimberly Greene, entered the plea on his behalf as he stood behind glass in an enclosed custody area of the packed Los Angeles courtroom.\n\nThe third of Rob Reiner’s four children, Nick Reiner has been held without bail since his arrest hours after beloved actor-director Reiner and photographer and producer Singer were found dead on Dec. 14 at their home in the upscale Brentwood section of Los Angeles.\n\nReiner appeared in court with a shaved head and light facial hair, wearing brown jail clothes. He talked to his lawyer briefly through the glass before the judge began the hearing. At one point a low door in the enclosure was opened and they crouched down and spoke face-to-face. During the hearing, he spoke only to answer yes when the judge asked if he waived his right for next steps of the case to proceed speedily.\n\nReiner was not wearing the suicide prevention smock he wore in his first court appearance in December days after his parent's killings. It was the third time he had been set to enter a plea, but issues surrounding the high-stakes, closely watched case, including a surprising change in defense lawyers, kept it from happening until Monday.\n\nThe judge told Reiner to return to court April 29 for the scheduling of a preliminary hearing where prosecutors will present evidence and a new judge will decide if it’s enough for Reiner to go to trial.\n\nThe case will now be handled by longtime Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Sam Ohta. He has had many prominent murder, manslaughter and public corruption cases in his courtroom in recent years, but none have drawn the national media attention this case has.\n\nDistrict Attorney Nathan Hochman said outside court that his office still hasn’t decided whether it will seek the death penalty for Reiner. Hochman said the death penalty decision “goes through a very rigorous process. We will be looking at all aggravating and mitigating circumstances.”\n\nReiner’s not guilty plea is common for criminal defendants at this stage of the case, whatever their longer-term plan might be.\n\nReiner’s former attorney, the high-profile private lawyer Alan Jackson, had to quit the case at the previous hearing, citing reasons beyond his and his client’s control that ethics wouldn't let him reveal. But in parting, he adamantly declared that “pursuant to the laws of California, Nick Reiner is not guilty of murder,” a stance made official by Reiner's plea Monday.\n\nAuthorities have said nothing about possible motives, and leaks in the case have been virtually nonexistent on both sides, leaving some of the most basic questions about the killing unanswered publicly.\n\nRob Reiner, 78, and Michele Singer Reiner, 70, died from “multiple sharp force injuries,” the LA County Medical Examiner said in initial findings. Authorities said they were killed hours before the bodies were discovered. A court order has prevented the public release of more details.\n\nDeputy District Attorney Habib Balian said Monday that his office is still awaiting the full autopsy report from the Medical Examiner, but all other evidence has been turned over to the defense.\n\nRob Reiner was a prolific director whose work included some of the most memorable and endlessly watchable movies of the 1980s and ’90s. His credits included “This is Spinal Tap,” “Stand By Me,” “A Few Good Men,” and “When Harry Met Sally… ,” during the production of which he met photographer Michele Singer. They wed soon after and were married for 36 years.",

    "fullText": "Chronically online MAGA Congressman Mike Lee should have just kept this one in the drafts.\n\nThe Utah senator, 54, shared a photo on X on Sunday afternoon of masked Mexican cartel members, calling out “leftists” in an attempted double standards gotcha moment regarding the idea that ICE agents should not wear masks to hide their identities.\n\n“Cartel hitmen wear masks,” Lee, from his personal @BasedMikeLee account, wrote. “Leftists aren’t complaining.”\n\nHowever, the senator was quick to delete his post after a few prominent Democrats responded, calling out how Lee’s argument unintentionally backfired.\n\n“Yes. Cartel hitmen wear masks. That’s why ICE shouldn’t,” wrote Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n“Oh dear Mike,” wrote Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy. “I literally couldn’t make our argument better than you do. The bad guys wear masks. The good guys don’t.”\n\nHawaii Senator Brian Schatz replied, “Mike, I would like ICE to have the same standards as a local police department, not cartel hitmen.”\n\nLee’s posting of polarizing rhetoric on social media, only to delete it later, is nothing new.\n\nIn June 2025, after Democratic Minnesota state representative Melissa Hortman and her husband were assassinated in their home by Trump voter Vance Boelter, the GOP congressman tweeted and deleted some incredulous accusations blaming liberals for her death.\n\nIn one deleted post, Lee called the killing a “Nightmare on Waltz Street” in a misspelled effort to pin the blame on the state’s Democratic governor and staunch Trump administration adversary, Tim Walz.\n\nIn another deleted post, Lee said, “This is what happens... When Marxists don’t get their way.”\n\nMS NOW host Lawrence O’Donnell said the senator was “not well” in the wake of his comments regarding the fatal shooting of Hortman and her husband.\n\n“Mike Lee appears to be in an agonizing mental struggle with how to be a human being,” O’Donnell, 74, said on The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell last year.\n\n“100 tweets a day is not healthy,” he continued, referring to the congressman’s avid social media usage as reported by the Salt Lake Tribune. “No United States senator actually doing the job of senator would have the time for 100 tweets a day, or even 10 tweets a day.”\n\nThough Lee deleted his posts about Hortman’s assassination, the Utah senator never officially apologized for his comments.",

    "description": "The CBO estimates that benefit reductions would start at 8% in 2040 and steadily climb to a 10% cut by 2056.",
    "fullText": "Recent policy changes and economic shifts have slashed 12 years off the projected life span of the trust fund that pays for Medicare Part A, according to a newly updated report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund is now slated to be entirely exhausted by 2040, even though the balance generally increases through 2031, as spending will begin to outstrip income in the following year.\n\nThis rapid deterioration of Medicare’s financial solvency represents a stark drop from the CBO’s previous estimate, which was published just last year, in March 2025. The dramatically shortened timeline means future retirees could face significant cuts to vital health care services far sooner than previously anticipated. As required by the Deficit Control Act, CBO Director Phillip Swagel noted the projections reflect the assumption benefits would be paid as scheduled even after the HI trust fund was exhausted.\n\nThe primary culprit for this accelerated depletion is a sharp reduction in the fund’s projected income, heavily driven by legislation passed over the last year. Specifically, the 2025 reconciliation act (Public Law 119-21, more commonly known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act) significantly reduced the revenues the trust fund normally receives from taxing Social Security benefits. This legislation lowered tax rates and established a temporary deduction for taxpayers age 65 or older. Consequently, this major policy shift enacted during the Trump administration has directly contributed to starving the Medicare safety net of critical future funding.\n\nThe HI trust fund is the financial backbone for Medicare Part A, which covers essential services including inpatient hospital care, stays in skilled nursing facilities, home health care, and hospice care. Over the next 30 years, the fund is expected to rely on the Medicare payroll tax for about three-quarters of its annual income, with another roughly one-eighth derived from income taxes on Social Security benefits.\n\nHowever, the recent tax cuts are not the only factor draining the fund. The CBO also cited decreased projections for payroll tax revenues, warning it had to adjust their models to account for lower expected worker earnings. Furthermore, because the trust fund will have smaller balances going forward, it will generate less interest income, creating a compounding negative effect on its overall finances.\n\nOn the other side of the ledger, Medicare spending is rising faster than anticipated. The CBO noted per-enrollee spending in Medicare Part A’s fee-for-service program in 2025, along with 2026 bids by Medicare Advantage plan providers, both came in higher than expected.",

    "fullText": "LEFT: Lauren Boebert (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call via AP Images) RIGHT: Tony Gonzales (Francis Chung/POLITICO via AP Images)\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) called on Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-TX) to resign on Monday, hours after 24sight News reported on inappropriate text messages that Gonzales sent to Regina Santos-Aviles, a former staffer who committed suicide by self-immolation last September.\n\nThe new messages — in which Gonzales asked Santos-Aviles to send him “a sexy pic” and fantasized about being “On top pinning your legs” — were produced less than a week after another former Gonzales employee who described himself as Santos-Aviles’s “best friend” told the  San Antonio Express-News that Santos-Aviles had admitted the affair to him, and that she had been battling depression ever since her husband found out about the relationship, causing the congressman to “abruptly cut her off.” The staffer also produced text messages in which Santos-Aviles admitted to the affair.\n\nGonzales has repeatedly denied the allegations that he had an affair with Santos-Aviles, and blamed last week’s story on his primary opponent in a statement that read:\n\nMs. Santos-Aviles was a kind soul who devoted her life to making the community a better place. Her efforts led to improvements in school safety, healthcare, and rural water like never before. It’s shameful that Brandon Herrera [Gonzales’s primary opponent] is using a disgruntled former staffer to smear her memory and score political points, conveniently pushing this out the very day early voting started. I am not going to engage in these personal smears and instead will remain focused on helping President Trump secure the border and improve the lives of all Texans.\n\nAt least one of his colleagues is not convinced of his innocence, though. Boebert called on Gonzales to resign after the publication of the incriminating text messages.\n\n.@RepTonyGonzales, RESIGN! https://t.co/sOjPAt0CWS\n\n— Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) February 23, 2026\n\nBoebert’s demand is notable given the fact that Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) and the GOP command the smallest majority in nearly a century. If Gonzales were to resign, it would shrink further to 217-214, with four vacancies. The tight margin of error is particularly notable given the fact that some Republicans, including Reps. Don Bacon (R-NE) and Thomas Massie (R-KY), have proven willing to defect and vote with the Democrats on myriad issues.\n\nThe post JUST IN: Lauren Boebert Demands Fellow House Republican Resign Amid Growing Scandal first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "As a full-time travel writer who's visited 27 Greek islands, I think Symi and Milos are two of the best to visit. However, I'd skip visiting Mykonos.",
    "fullText": "As a full-time travel writer and content creator, I'm eager to explore as much of the world as possible. And although I often prioritize visiting new destinations, I can't help but return to Greece again and again.\n\nI adore the country, and over the last five years, I've visited 27 islands — some of them multiple times. However, a few just didn't capture my heart in the same way.\n\nHere are three Greek islands I'd return to and two I'd skip in the future.\n\nSymi is easily one of my favorite Greek Islands because it feels more lowkey than some of the more famous spots like Mykonos or Santorini.\n\nFor stunning views overlooking the bay, I recommend hiking up the Kali Strata's hundreds of stairs. I also suggest joining a full-day boat trip with Poseidon cruises or hopping on a water taxi to visit one of the nearby beaches.\n\nIn my opinion, Milos has some of the most stunning beaches in Greece.\n\nOne of the most well-known spots is Sarakiniko Beach, which is famous for its lunar landscape — a series of smooth, white, volcanic rock formations that resemble the surface of the moon.\n\nI recommend renting a car to explore Milos by land, but don't skip a boat trip around the island as well — some of the best swim spots are only accessible from the water.\n\nSeveral tiny fishing villages also add a unique factor to this island. In some of them, traditional boathouses have been renovated into cozy, waterfront villas and hotels. I recommend booking one for a truly immersive experience.\n\nSkiathos is a charming island filled with great local shops and some of the best Greek food I've had during my travels. It also has a lively nightlife scene, with plenty of bars and clubs that stay open late.\n\nDuring the day, you can hop on a boat or a bus to explore the many beaches in the area. In the evening, I recommend taking advantage of lengthy happy hours at the many cocktail bars offering sunset views.\n\nIf you love \"Mamma Mia,\" Open Air Cinema hosts special screenings of the movie — after all, parts of it were filmed on the island. I recommend grabbing tickets early because they sell out quickly.\n\nMykonos is known for its upscale beach clubs, lively bars, and cute old town. It delivers on all of these fronts, but in my opinion, it does so at a cost.\n\nIt's known as one of the pricier Greek islands to visit, and although I enjoyed my time there, it's not somewhere I feel the need to go back to.\n\nInstead, I recommend taking a multi-day Greek Island sailing trip that stops in Mykonos. That way, you can see it and experience some of the hype, but you don't have to stay for more than one night.\n\nGoing into my trip, I knew that Kos was more touristy than other islands I've visited. However, although it's beautiful, I ultimately found it to be underwhelming.\n\nInstead of unique gifts, I found that most of the old town was filled with typical tourist shops. The beaches were OK, but also seemed less picturesque compared to those I've visited on other islands.\n\nSince Kos has an international airport, I think it's best suited as a starting point for reaching other destinations.\n\nThis story was originally published on September 19, 2024, and most recently updated on February 23, 2026.",

    "fullText": "Peter Mandelson, the United Kingdom's former Ambassador to the United States, was arrested by the Metropolitan Police on Monday in the continued fallout over the Epstein files.\n\nThe police confirmed they had arrested a 72-year-old \"former government minister\" on suspicion of misconduct in public office, following search warrants at two addresses, including Camden. The description matches that of Mandelson.\n\nDocuments released by the Department of Justice in January showed Mandelson sharing sensitive government information with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nIn emails sent while Mandelson was a government minister, the politician forwarded internal memos to Epstein, tipping him off about changes in tax rules, the sale of government assets during the UK financial crisis, and the European Union's bailout of Greece's economy.\n\nThe documents also contain a record of Epstein sending money to Mandelson's husband, Reinaldo Avila da Silva.\n\nLast year, he was fired as ambassador after more about his ties to Epstein became public, and he subsequently left the British Labour Party.\n\nEarlier this month, the Metropolitan Police announced an investigation into Mandelson.\n\nMandelson has denied any illegal activity and told The Times of London that his husband's acceptance of funds from Epstein reflected \"a lapse in our collective judgment.\"\n\nLast week, King Charles' younger brother, the former Prince Andrew, was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office over government documents he shared with Epstein. The former prince, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, has denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe scandal around Mandelson has grown to affect Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has faced backlash for appointing Mandelson to the ambassador position in 2024, despite knowing about his ties to Epstein. Several of Starmer's senior staff members have quit over the revelations.",

    "description": "The wealthy are becoming worried about the US economy more rapidly than lower-income households. A Wall Street veteran says it's that's bullish for stocks.",
    "fullText": "The S&P 500 could be set to break out of its anemic trading range, according to a veteran Wall Street strategist.\n\nThe key metric to watch isn't some piece of technical analysis or a big earnings update. Rather, it's the growing feeling of economic unease among high-earning Americans, according to Jim Paulsen.\n\nThe S&P 500 is roughly flat since the start of 2026 as investors weigh the market impact of Trump's uncertain tariff regime and AI disruption fears. Jim Paulsen, former chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group, says his new market indicator, which he dubs the poor/rich sentiment measure, has successfully forecast recent market rallies and is signaling a potential upswing is on the horizon.\n\nLower-income households were seen by forecasters as a weak spot in the economy for some time, but their mood has been brightening of late. At the same time, high earners have become more downbeat. This narrowing of the sentiment gap, Paulsen says, is a buy signal.\n\nPaulsen compares consumer confidence in the economy by income level to find a daily confidence ratio that he then combines with a ratio of Walmart's stock performance relative to the S&P Global Luxury stock price index.\n\nPaulsen overlaid his poor/rich sentiment indicator over the S&P 500 to assess it as an indicator for market performance.\n\n\"The Poor/Rich sentiment indicator has spiked higher 8 previous times since 2018 — in late-2018, October 2019, March 2020, May 2022, October 2022, November 2023, September 2024, and in April 2025. During each of these previous spikes in the Poor/Rich sentiment indicator, the S&P 500 was at a level which represented a good buy! \"\n\nSince the end of 2025, Paulsen's indicator has climbed. The measure's spike since December shares similarities with increases seen at the end of the 2022 bear market and at the 2020 pandemic lows.\n\nThe strategist ties the indicator's success to the idea that if the high-income cohort is losing faith in the economy, then the stock market is often at a low point. Paulsen highlights a downturn in Bloomberg's US billionaires relative total return index, which he says could be a signal that the rich are losing faith in the market.\n\n\"We seem to be in a relatively rare period when the Rich are losing confidence faster than the Poor … when the rich start complaining more than the poor, it's often been a good time to step up and buy some equities,\" the strategist said.\n\nPaulsen warned investors against using a single gauge, but said it may be a good time to assess equity exposure.\n\n\"If you are underinvested, perhaps it's worth considering taking advantage of recent volatility by adding to your equity exposure during selloffs,\" he wrote on his Substack post.",

    "description": "Over 9,000 flights have been canceled since Sunday as a snowstorm blankets the East Coast. FlightAware's Misery Map shows where chaos is piling up.",
    "fullText": "Even if you could make it to the airport as winter storm Hernando blankets runways and aircraft, your flight probably wasn't going anywhere.\n\nA \"misery map\" from the aviation-tracking website Flightaware shows where disruptions are piling up fastest. So far, more than 9,000 flights have been canceled across the US since Sunday. More disruptions are expected on Tuesday.\n\nCirium data shows that of the about 25,000 scheduled US flights on Monday, roughly 20% aren't taking off, compared with 1% on a typical day. It was about the same on Sunday.\n\nThe Northeast is bearing the brunt of the storm, with nearly every flight from Philadelphia to Boston canceled. More than half of the roughly 750 daily departures from Washington, DC-area airports have also been scrapped, mostly from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, the closest to the city.\n\nThe misery map doesn't currently show some smaller airports like Providence, Rhode Island, and Hartford, Connecticut, that have been similarly slammed by snow.\n\nThe disruptions — especially at busy hub airports — have caused a ripple effect across the national network, stranding travelers booked on subsequently canceled inbound planes far from home. This includes thousands of people on about 550 flights from abroad.\n\nWith only a handful of international flights per day, airlines may deploy additional planes to shuttle passengers back once the storm passes. Airlines made a similar call in January when people got stranded in the Caribbean amid a US raid on Venezuela.\n\nEven after the snow lets up, it could take airlines days to get back on schedule.\n\nAirport staff — many of whom may be stuck at home — may struggle to get to work quickly. Snow on the tarmacs, taxiways, and runways must be removed and full inspections completed before planes can safely land or take off. And aircraft must be de-iced and cleared of snow before each departure — processes that can take hours in heavy storms.\n\nTravelers shouldn't expect compensation for the chaos.\n\nAirlines classify the snowstorm as a \"force majeure\" event — situations outside their control that force flight delays, cancellations, or diversions. Travelers may receive a voucher for meals or hotel accommodations as a gesture of goodwill, but it's not required by federal law. Still, it doesn't hurt to ask.\n\nIf you booked your flight with a travel credit card, such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve or the American Express Platinum, you may be able to recoup expenses through their dedicated reimbursement programs.\n\nTravelers can get refunds for canceled flights (so long as they choose not to fly), and airlines are waiving change fees and fare differences as they suspend operations in certain airports. The changed flight must typically fall within a specific time window and be to and from the itinerary's original airports.\n\nIt has been a hectic 24 hours for air travel.\n\nAbout 40 Mexico‑bound flights were canceled or diverted on Sunday as carriers suspended operations to resort destinations amid cartel‑related unrest — adding to the logistical chaos already caused by the snowstorm.\n\nA confusing TSA PreCheck policy — which ended in the lanes remaining open, even after Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced they'd close amid the partial government shutdown — didn't help.",

    "fullText": "The US Navy abruptly fired the commander of guided-missile destroyer USS Truxtun after his ship collided with a logistics vessel during a resupply operation at sea earlier this month.\n\nRear Adm. Carlos Sardiello, who leads US Naval Forces Southern Command and 4th Fleet, relieved Cmdr. James Koffi on Sunday.\n\nThe ship collision that resulted in a \"loss of confidence\" and cost Koffi his command occurred during a replenishment-at-sea operation involving USNS Supply, a fast combat support ship, the Navy said in a statement on the relief.\n\nThe cause of the ship collision remains under investigation but highlights the risks of at-sea logistics and the challenges of keeping naval forces on the move.\n\nReplenishments-at-sea are resupplies in which one ship sails closely alongside another to transfer supplies such as fuel or ammunition. These missions are routine operations that support global naval activity by allowing vessels to remain at sea, rather than forcing them to return to port.\n\nAt-sea replenishments carry risks, though, that can be exacerbated by a range of factors beyond proximity, such as sea state, crew fatigue, communication breakdowns, and equipment failures.\n\nTwo personnel sustained minor injuries during the February 11 collision between the Truxton and Supply.\n\nKoffi, who took over the Truxtun just over a year ago, has been reassigned to Commander, Naval Surface Group Middle Atlantic. The Truxton, which had been deployed for under a month when the ship collision happened, is in port in Ponce, Puerto Rico. The Navy said the ship is undergoing repairs.\n\nCmdr. Taylor Auclair, who most recently served at US Fleet Forces Command, has been assigned to command the Truxtun.\n\n\"The Navy maintains the highest standards for leaders and holds them accountable when those standards are not met,\" the Navy said in a press release.\n\nA near-miss during a resupply in 2024 resulted in the relief of the commander of USS John S. McCain, another destroyer. And last year, the Navy relieved the captain of an aircraft carrier after it collided with a civilian merchant vessel during a deployment that experienced a string of major accidents, including the loss of three fighter jets, including one to a friendly-fire incident.\n\nThe Truxton deployed to Caribbean waters as part of President Donald Trump's pressure campaign against Venezuela and narcotics trafficking. The administration sent nearly a dozen warships, among other combat assets, to the region late last year. The military launched strikes on suspected drug-smuggling boats, seized oil tankers, and carried out a January raid inside Venezuela that resulted in the capture of its former president, Nicolás Maduro.\n\nMore recently, roughly a dozen Navy warships have been directed to the Middle East as the administration has shifted focus to a ballooning buildup in the region. As of last week, the Truxton is now one of just five ships remaining in the Caribbean",

    "fullText": "Newly captured satellite imagery shows widespread fires, roadblocks, and cars burning in a Costco parking lot after cartel violence rocked the Mexican resort town of Puerto Vallarta, the company that took the photos said.\n\nThe imagery, captured Sunday by US spatial intelligence firm Vantor and analyzed by Business Insider, underscores the scale of the chaos gripping Puerto Vallarta, nestled along the Pacific Ocean in Mexico's Jalisco state, and its hundreds of thousands of residents.\n\nFires and smoke can be seen across the city, including along a coastal road, in a Costco parking lot, at a shopping mall, and at an Autozone. Roadblocks are also visible in the imagery. Puerto Vallarta is a major tourist destination, especially in the winter.\n\nMexican forces carried out an operation Sunday that killed Nemesio \"El Mencho\" Oseguera Cervantes, the notorious leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel who had a $15 million US bounty on his head.\n\nPresident Donald Trump designated the cartel as a foreign terrorist organization just last year. Karoline Leavitt, a White House spokesperson, said the US provided intelligence support to Mexico to assist with the operation, although she did not specify how.\n\nThe Trump administration has made it a priority to combat Latin American cartels, encouraging heads of state to have a tougher stance against them and even using military force against alleged drug boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean Sea.\n\nThree additional cartel members were killed, three were wounded, and two more were arrested in the operation, which took place in Talpalpa, a town in the Jalisco state, Leavitt said. Mexico said three soldiers were hurt in the raid.\n\nRetaliatory violence erupted in cities across Mexico following the raid, with organized criminal groups and suspected cartel members clashing with security forces and setting fire to cars and buildings.\n\nThe US State Department urged American citizens in some locations to shelter in place and said most domestic and international flights were canceled in Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta, where scenes of the violence were shared widely on social media.\n\nDozens of suspected cartel members and security personnel have been killed in the violence, with Mexican authorities scrambling to regain control of the chaos.",

Those are all phrases used in recent, panicked discussions of private credit, but according to Bank of America, commentary from the bears is creating a stream of misinformation that's to blame for the sector's recent troubles.\n\nThe Financial Times last week reported that Blue Owl, an alternative asset manager focused on private credit, froze withdrawals from one of its funds offered to retail investors, generating fresh concerns about the market and sparking comparisons to the financial crisis.\n\nEconomist Mohamed El-Erian said the situation could be a \"canary-in-the-coalmine\" moment akin to 2007, before the onset of the Great Financial Crisis. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he's \"concerned\" and watching the Blue Owl news. Adding to the troubles, Business Insider reported that Blue Owl was unable to finance a data center set to be occupied by CoreWeave.\n\nBlue Owl stock has fallen more than 16% in five days.\n\nYet, Bank of America analysts wrote on Monday that they're not worried about private credit, indicating they're surprised so many are. They say investors' worries are being driven by a lack of understanding about what private credit is.\n\n\"There is a significant level of misinformation weighing on OWL and the private credit industry which has led to a particularly attractive buying opportunity for OWL,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nBank of America's price target for Blue Owl stock implies a more than 100% upside.\n\nIt said there are a few reasons it remains upbeat on the sector. For one, BofA said that Blue Owl's data center exposure is separate from the rest of its private credit business. It also believes credit quality in the software sector is strong. Finally, last year's high-profile blowups of First Brands and Tricolor Holdings weren't precursors to a wider spate of private credit crises.\n\nBofA was bullish on the private credit space coming into 2026, and it remains upbeat in the long term.\n\n\"We continue to view private credit as an attractive contributor to a US retirees' portfolio given the high returns, downside protection and monthly dividends and it has even outperformed most equity strategies over the last three years,\" the bank wrote.",

    "title": "Meta AI alignment director shares her OpenClaw email-deletion nightmare: 'I had to RUN to my Mac mini'",
    "description": "Meta alignment director Summer Yue hooked OpenClaw up to her inbox. Then, the bot tried to delete her emails. Yue chalked it up to a \"rookie mistake.\"",
    "fullText": "Even the people hired to keep AI aligned can't always keep it in line.\n\nMeta's Summer Yue has been testing OpenClaw, a popular open-source AI agent capable of working 24/7 on behalf of its users. Then the bot went out of control, according to photos she posted on X. It ended up planning to delete her emails — and wouldn't stop after being directed to.\n\nIn her X post, Yue's OpenClaw bot said that it would \"trash EVERYTHING in inbox older than Feb 15 that isn't already in my keep list.\"\n\nYue tried multiple times to stop it. First, she messaged the AI agent, \"Do not do that.\" As the bot kept planning to delete her inbox, she wrote, \"STOP OPENCLAW.\"\n\n\"I couldn't stop it from my phone,\" Yue wrote in her post. \"I had to RUN to my Mac mini like I was defusing a bomb.\"\n\nNothing humbles you like telling your OpenClaw “confirm before acting” and watching it speedrun deleting your inbox. I couldn’t stop it from my phone. I had to RUN to my Mac mini like I was defusing a bomb. pic.twitter.com/XAxyRwPJ5R\n\nYue had previously tried OpenClaw on her \"toy inbox,\" where she wrote that the bot worked well and gained her trust. Testing it on her \"real inbox,\" the bot had to compact a much larger set of emails. She instructed it not to take action without approval, but OpenClaw lost the prompt during compaction, she wrote.\n\nYue joined Meta after its deal with Scale AI as a director of alignment of its Superintelligence Labs division, according to her LinkedIn profile. That's left some critics on social media confused: why would someone studying AI safety use such an AI agent that has previously drawn security concerns?\n\nUnlike other AI agents, OpenClaw does not need human approval to sign off on actions. It was also vibe-coded, and that combined with OpenClaw's level of system access has led some AI researchers to question the bot's security. AI researcher Gary Marcus told Business Insider that it was like \"giving full access to your computer and all your passwords to a guy you met at a bar who says he can help you out.\"\n\nOpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger, who has since been hired by OpenAI, recently said in a podcast interview that he was prioritizing building out additional security safeguards over ease-of-use features.\n\nThough it's not altogether surprising that someone working in AI would test out one of the buzziest AI products of the last year, some X users criticized Yue for hooking up OpenClaw to her real email in the first place. Ben Hylak, the cofounder of Raindrop AI and an Apple alum, posted a screenshot of her LinkedIn. \"This should terrify you,\" he wrote. \"What is Meta doing?\"\n\n\"Somewhat concerning that a person whose job is AI alignment is surprised when an AI doesn't precisely follow verbal instructions,\" another X user wrote.\n\nYou can't make this up. And this happened to a someone working on safety and alignment at META Superintelligence Lab.\n\nI don't get how people can let AI agents go on unsupervised like this.\n\nI'll stick to my supervised use of AI for now. pic.twitter.com/tWvQFd1NP5\n\nYue and Meta didn't respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nYue also isn't the only Meta employee to toy around with OpenClaw; creator Peter Steinberger said that Mark Zuckerberg played with the tool for a week and even sent feedback. While Meta courted him, Steinberger later accepted a job offer from OpenAI.\n\nIn the comments of Yue's post, someone asked about her AI alignment role. \"Were you intentionally testing its guardrails or did you make a rookie mistake?\" they wrote.\n\n\"Rookie mistake tbh,\" Yue responded. \"Turns out alignment researchers aren't immune to misalignment.\"",

    "title": "David Ellison's Paramount has some breathing room in its quest to buy WBD despite a pressing deadline",
    "description": "Paramount is in a bidding war with Netflix for Warner Bros. and has until March to make its best and final offer.",
    "fullText": "Paramount Skydance is staring down a key deadline in its pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery, but it doesn't need to make a move quite yet.\n\nDavid Ellison and company have been able to negotiate directly with WBD's leadership team in recent days for the first time in months — thanks to Netflix, Paramount's rival in the bidding war.\n\nNetflix granted WBD, its deal partner, a weeklong waiver on negotiation exclusivity that expires at midnight on Monday. The company said it hoped these talks between Paramount and WBD would \"fully and finally resolve\" the monthslong saga that it said has been an \"ongoing distraction\" for both Netflix and WBD shareholders.\n\nAs of midday Monday, Paramount hasn't made its \"best and final\" bid for WBD, though it doesn't necessarily have to rush. That's because the seven-day window that Netflix granted Warner Bros. is to talk with Paramount, not the deadline for Paramount to raise its bid.\n\n\"Anyone can make an offer up to the shareholder vote,\" a person familiar with the WBD-Paramount negotiations told Business Insider.\n\nWBD's shareholder vote is on March 20. At that meeting, investors can choose to either approve or reject the Netflix deal, or they can abstain. WBD shareholders who prefer Paramount's offer can tender their shares to Ellison and company. Paramount has set a March 2 deadline for that, though it could be extended. If Paramount gets a majority of shares, it could shift WBD's course toward its own offer over Netflix's.\n\nThat means Paramount's real deadline for submitting its best offer is weeks away, though the company could raise its bid well before that. If Paramount raises its offer, Netflix will have four days to respond.\n\nWBD has said it prefers Netflix's all-cash offer of $27.75 per share for its studio and streaming assets over Paramount's proposal of $30 per share for the entire company, including its cable TV networks.\n\nWBD warned last week that if it went with Paramount, its employees could quit in droves, ahead of what could be a major round of layoffs under Ellison. Paramount has said it plans to create $6 billion in cost savings, which would include layoffs, compared to $2 billion or $3 billion from Netflix.\n\nParamount has argued that Netflix is the biggest threat to Hollywood since it has the most streaming subscribers and dominates viewership share among paid streamers. Netflix's counterargument is that it also competes against YouTube and other free streamers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is another variable. Trump said in December that Netflix's acquisition of Warner Bros. \"could be a problem\" due to its market share, before saying in early February that he had decided he \"shouldn't be involved\" in the regulatory process.\n\nA White House spokesperson told Business Insider last week that Trump \"has great relationships with all parties in this potential transaction and remains neutral in this process with no preference for either bidder.\"\n\nThen on Saturday, Trump said Netflix should remove Susan Rice from its board \"or pay the consequences.\" On a podcast, Rice, a former senior White House official under Obama and Biden, criticized the Trump administration and companies that \"take a knee\" under pressure from the president.\n\nNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos shrugged off the president's remarks on Monday, saying that the streaming titan's bid for Warner Bros. is \"not a political deal.\"",

    "description": "Anthropic's Claude is allegedly going to destroy  a bunch of jobs. Unless you look at the startup's job listings.",
    "fullText": "I've seen some silly predictions about the future of work lately. If you're worried about AI destroying jobs, take a quick trip through Anthropic's careers page. It's one of my favorite spots on the internet right now.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei is among the loudest voices warning that AI could erase many white-collar jobs. He's been especially outspoken about coding, given Anthropic's Claude Code is so powerful.\n\nA successful editor once told me to focus on what people and companies do, not what they say. So let's look at the jobs Anthropic is trying to fill right now.\n\nTop of the list: software engineering roles. The AI company with the most effective coding-automation machine on earth is looking to hire more than 100 coding experts.\n\nThis job posting stood out to me. Anthropic is hiring an iOS developer to build mobile apps. I thought you could just vibe-code apps these days? Apparently not.\n\nBoris Cherny, the creator of Claude Code, was asked about this recently. If this AI tool is writing most or all of Anthropic's code these days, why is the company still hiring so many software developers?\n\n\"Someone has to prompt the Claudes, talk to customers, coordinate with other teams, decide what to build next,\" Cherny replied on X. \"Engineering is changing and great engineers are more important than ever.\"\n\nLet that sink in. Software development is probably the job that is most disrupted by AI. Models have gotten good at coding because it's relatively easy to evaluate good versus bad outputs. That's because the code either works, or it doesn't, when deployed. This creates clear yes/no signals that are really valuable for training and fine-tuning new AI models.\n\nSo if Anthropic is still hiring more than 100 software engineers, then other types of jobs that are less impacted by AI should probably endure as well.\n\nProving my point, Anthropic has 32 finance jobs open, along with 33 in marketing, 16 in legal, and more than 100 in sales.\n\nI'm not just telling you this to make you feel better. When extreme AI job predictions are made, it leads to dumb ideas such as banning data center construction.\n\nSo, take a breath. AI is just a (powerful) tool to help humans get more work done. I'll leave you with final thoughts on this topic from Jensen Huang (who, by the way, is hiring humans like crazy).\n\nIn a recent interview, he argued that fears of mass job destruction often confuse the \"tasks\" involved in a job with the broader \"purpose\" of the role. AI, in his view, changes how tasks get done, but the purpose remains the same. And that means, the technology probably won't destroy jobs and could even increase demand for the people responsible for outcomes at work.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "\"These campaigns are growing in intensity and sophistication,\" Anthropic said as part of its lengthy statement.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic says its Chinese competitors are stealing from the AI startup to gain an edge in the global AI race.\n\nOn Monday, Anthropic said three of China's biggest AI labs, DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot AI, were \"illicitly\" using Claude \"to improve their own models,\" through a process known as distillation.\n\n\"These campaigns are growing in intensity and sophistication,\" Anthropic said as part of its lengthy statement on Monday. \"The window to act is narrow, and the threat extends beyond any single company or region. Addressing it will require rapid, coordinated action among industry players, policymakers, and the global AI community.\n\nAnthropic said the distillation efforts were \"industrial-scale campaigns\" that included roughly 24,000 fraudulent Claude accounts that generated over 16 million exchanges \"in violation of our terms of service and regional access restrictions.\"\n\nDistillation is the process of training a less powerful model on the output of a more powerful model. The practice is a legitimate way that many US companies use to train their models for public release. Increasingly, major US companies are also stating that their Chinese competitors are improperly using the practice to steal their work.\n\nIn January 2025, OpenAI said DeepSeek may have \"inappropriately\" used OpenAI's outputs to train their models. Earlier this month, Google disclosed it had \"identified an increase in model extraction attempts or 'distillation attacks.'\"\n\n\"Competitors can use it to acquire powerful capabilities from other labs in a fraction of the time, and at a fraction of the cost, that it would take to develop them independently,\" Anthropic said on Monday.\n\nAnthropic disclosed remarkable detail about the extent to which DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot AI \"illicitly\" used their systems. Claude is not available for commercial access in China, though Anthropic said the rival labs found workarounds.\n\nAmong the notable findings, Anthropic said DeepSeek sought to create \"censorship-safe alternatives to policy-sensitive queries.\" The company also said it detected MiniMax's campaign \"while it was still active,\" giving them an in-depth look at what their competitor was doing.\n\n\"When we released a new model during MiniMax's active campaign, they pivoted within 24 hours, redirecting nearly half their traffic to capture capabilities from our latest system,\" Anthropic said.\n\nRepresentatives for DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot AI did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nBeyond cheating in the AI, Anthropic said improper distillation poses security risks because less-trained models may lack the proper safeguards, such as those to prevent the development of bioweapons.\n\nIn response to such distillation campaigns, Anthropic said it has built in \"behavioral fingerprinting systems,\" shares data with other AI companies on what to look out for, and continues to develop additional countermeasures.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei recently wrote that leading models are approaching the point where, without proper safeguards, they could help direct someone in building a bioweapon.\n\nAmodei is also an outspoken advocate of US-export controls, a topic that divides some leading tech CEOs. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has repeatedly said that restricting US companies, including his own, from selling advanced chips to China won't curb China's AI advancements.\n\n\"Distillation attacks therefore reinforce the rationale for export controls: restricted chip access limits both direct model training and the scale of illicit distillation,\" Anthropic said.\n\nAnthropic has also faced allegations of using copyrighted material to train its models. In January, the Washington Post reported new details about an endeavor at the company called Project Panama, which the company reportedly described as \"our effort to destructively scan all the books in the world.\" Last year, Anthropic settled a class-action lawsuit brought by the authors and publishers of some of the books for $1.5 billion. As part of the settlement, the company didn't admit any wrongdoing.",

    "description": "222 wants to grow beyond helping people make new friends. The AI-powered startup also wants to help people find love and maintain relationships.",
    "fullText": "It'd be nice to meet someone the old-fashioned way: Passing by them on the street, meeting at a restaurant, or sharing an exchange at a party.\n\nHowever, apps dominate the modern dating experience, replacing kismet meet-cutes with scrolling and DMs.\n\n222, a startup focused on relationship building with the help of AI, thinks it can bring back the spontaneity of making a new friend — or falling in love.\n\n\"We're trying to get as close as possible to you walking into someplace with other people there, and connection just naturally happens,\" CEO Keyan Kazemian told Business Insider.\n\nAt a high level, 222 matches people with strangers for experiences like dinner or a night out after they take a robust personality quiz, using machine learning models trained by its team and open-source AI models.\n\n\"When you walk in, all of those people are people we predict you're going to be able to have a good conversation with, and you'll like,\" COO Danial Hashemi said.\n\nWhen 222 launched in 2021, it began as a dinner series in Los Angeles for young adults emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, helping them meet new people. Then the project grew into a company. It was accepted into Y Combinator, raised capital, moved to New York City, and launched a mobile app to spur in-real-life (IRL) socializing.\n\nWhile people who join 222 are often new to a city, Kazemian said, today they're pretty evenly split along why they're using the platform: they're either looking for new friends or potential romantic connections.\n\nSince putting out its app in 2024, the 222 experience has evolved. It's no longer just about meeting strangers, having a fun night, and forming new relationships.\n\n\"We're very focused on going beyond that,\" Kazemian said.\n\nThe platform is now digging deeper into connecting people after the first encounter that 222 initiates. It's helping plan follow-up hangs with friends and kindling a romantic connection by setting people up on a date if the feeling is mutual.\n\nAfter a 222 experience, the platform follows up to ask attendees whether they want to hang out or go on a date with anyone they met.\n\nOnce two people say they'd like to go on a date, \"we fully set up the next date for them,\" Hashemi said — reservation and all.\n\n\"If you think about just before dating apps, before all this stuff, how would people meet each other?\" Hashemi said. \"It would be you're in the same physical space with no preconceived notions of who this person is going to be.\"\n\nHashemi said that some of the \"joy\" of navigating how you feel about someone new in your life has \"gone away because of dating apps.\"\n\nMeeting in a way that feels more organic, such as a social gathering or through friends, has staying power. A 2025 survey of 7,000 US adults by health company Hims found that 77% of Gen Z met their partners IRL. Even Partiful, the Gen Z replacement for Facebook Events, is getting in on the IRL event-to-dating pipeline.\n\n222 thinks AI can make the meet-cute more accessible.\n\nWhat 222's founding team has zeroed in on is \"labeled data,\" Kazemian said, which comes from its users' feedback after they meet people.\n\nThe startup knows its first pairings may not be the ultimate match, which is why it encourages its subscribers — who pay $22 a month — to try multiple experiences. Its AI, in return, can curate better matches from 222's network.\n\nThere are layers of factors that contribute to that, 222's CTO Arman Roshannai said, such as similar music tastes or hometowns.\n\n\"The signal that we're training on is after you meet this person, you spend two hours getting dinner with them, and then you hang out for a few hours afterwards, were you guys actually a good match for each other?\" Roshannai added.\n\nKazemian added that training on this proprietary data from user feedback is a \"painstakingly difficult and long process,\" but gives the startup a \"technical moat\" to stand out from some competitors.\n\n222 isn't the only startup — or public company — betting that AI can improve how we connect.\n\nSeveral startups have launched with this premise and are raising millions, pitching matchmaking solutions that use AI to set people up. Meanwhile, Bumble, Tinder, and Facebook Dating are testing the AI waters and reimagining the swipe. Hinge's founder recently left the Match Group-owned dating app to build an AI dating alternative.\n\nAfter raising another $10.1 million from venture capital investors in 2025 — bringing the startup's total raised to $13.7 million — 222 is doubling down on hiring and expanding its product with tools that keep relationships going.\n\n222's next undertaking is to provide avenues for its users to reach their \"next offline moment\" together, so they can deepen those relationships.\n\nThe startup wants to be in the business of both creating relationships and maintaining them.\n\n\"They need to show up at the same place together,\" Kazemian said, be it a hangout, a date, or a restaurant reservation. \"We can help them figure out what that place is.\"",

It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nYesterday morning, my husband and I were sitting in bed, looking out the windows, when we suddenly saw what looked like a fast-moving cloud across the sky. At first, I thought it was a rainstorm coming, but when I opened the window properly, I could see it was smoke — tons of it.\n\nWith the window open, we could hear explosions erupting into plumes of smoke across the beautiful, historic district of Puerto Vallarta.\n\nI was shocked. My husband and I have been to this city every year for 10 years during the winter months to perform as musicians. We've never experienced anything like this. This city has always felt safe.\n\nI opened Facebook to try and see if anyone in the local community groups knew what was going on. Everyone was piecing together that this must be retaliation after Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, Mexico's leader of the Jalisco New Generation drug cartel, was killed during a security operation to arrest him on Sunday.\n\nRealizing we didn't have much food in the apartment, we went to a friend's apartment on the eighth floor of our building to eat.\n\nWe all went to the rooftop of the building and could clearly see all kinds of activity unfolding below us. There were fires in shops. There were people being pulled from cars. We saw people going into buildings and throwing Molotov cocktails.\n\nIt was frightening to look outside and see so much burning in flames, but it was oddly comforting to see that civilians weren't being harmed.\n\nAs the smoke rose up to where we were standing on the rooftop, it started to feel unsafe to breathe in all the flames, which smelled of gas. As late afternoon rolled in, the smoke dissipated, and by evening, it had disappeared.\n\nAt around 5:30 p.m., a giant military chopper circled around us, which felt alarming for everyone looking on. The night was quiet, and we slept through the night without any disturbance.\n\nToday, we can see that people are starting to venture out to corner stores for food, but many shops are still shuttered. People here like to eat out daily, keeping only small amounts of food at home. I can see lines outside the open shops. We have eggs and smoothies, so we are trying to stay in for the most part.\n\nI can sense that people are rolling with how things are going. Flights have been canceled, but I've heard Airbnbs and hotels have been great about letting people stay longer.\n\nWhile I'm not fearful, I am sad. I'm sad for locals who survive on tourism. Americans have traditionally been scared about the safety of Mexico, and this justifies fears. But for so long, this has not been the case in Puerto Vallarta — it's always been incredibly safe. I'm sad about the impact that this disruption will have on locals' livelihoods and the impact on the reputation of the city I love so much.\n\nDespite these last two days, I still feel safer in Puerto Vallarta than I do in the United States, where I live for large parts of the year. In the US, there is so much more gun violence targeted at civilians.\n\nAs messed up as the drug cartel attack is, it is retaliation against the government, rather than against actual civilians here in the city. I haven't felt unsafe these last two days, because never once did I feel like the cartels were coming for us.\n\nWe are scheduled to be here until March 6th. We have three performances left — they may or may not get canceled. We'll most likely just stay here until our return date home, unless things get really dangerous.",

    "description": "Governance watchers say Susan Rice's critique of Donald Trump is complicating Netflix's bid for Warner Bros., while others call her stance principled.",
    "fullText": "A corporate board seat can bring status and stock awards — and also political heat.\n\nThe criticism that Netflix board member Susan Rice leveled at President Donald Trump last week is dividing governance watchers over how political a corporate director can afford to be.\n\nRice, who served in top roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, made several critical remarks about the commander in chief during an appearance on the podcast \"Stay Tuned with Preet Bharara.\" Trump responded by demanding that Netflix remove her from her seat \"or pay the consequences.\"\n\nThe spat has come at a precarious time for the video-streaming company. Netflix's pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery— an $82.7 billion bid — could reshape Hollywood, but it requires approval from the Department of Justice's antitrust division.\n\nWhile Rice's actions didn't break any laws, governance experts who spoke with Business Insider were split over whether she crossed a line.\n\nDirectors would be wise to keep their personal views about politics and other sensitive topics out of the public eye, said Charles Elson, founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. Their fiduciary responsibility is to serve in the company's best interests, and Rice's remarks ran counter to that duty, he said.\n\n\"It's poor judgment. And you're elected as a director for your judgment,\" Elson said. \"She has to ask herself, 'Am I a public figure or am I a corporate director?'\"\n\nElson, himself a director, said he avoids publicly staking out political positions. \"I just don't think it's in my lane,\" he said.\n\nTrump's threat of retaliation, however, didn't align with the kind of conduct normally expected of a sitting president, either, said Jo-Ellen Pozner, a management and entrepreneurship professor at Santa Clara University's Leavey School of Business.\n\n\"It's really important to recognize that what Susan Rice was calling out is exactly the behavior that Trump responded with,\" she said. \"Trump's reaction just points out how important what she has to say is.\"\n\nRice spoke critically of Trump at length on the podcast, suggesting her remarks were intentional rather than off the cuff.\n\n\"This might have felt like the hill that she was ready to die on, metaphorically,\" added Pozner. \"It's definitely risky for her politically. It's definitely risky for the Netflix deal, but it also seems like such a principled stance that it ought to be respected by most people.\"\n\nRice, Netflix, and the White House didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIt is possible that Rice warned Netflix's leadership about the podcast and got its blessing behind the scenes. Ted Sarandos, the company's co-CEO, referred to its bid for Warner Bros. as a \"business deal\" on the BBC's Today program on Monday. \"It's not a political deal,\" he said.\n\nStill, Rice's public and partisan tongue-lashing is unusual for a director on a major corporate board. It could make companies reconsider whether to put political figures on their boards, Elson said.\n\n\"Obviously, someone coming out of public service has a lot of experience, a lot of intelligence,\" said Elson. But, he added, \"Are you retired or not?\"\n\nThe incident could further discourage corporate leaders from speaking their minds in public, said Pozner. The president has repeatedly targeted critics, publicly calling for boycotts of companies and attacking business figures who challenge him.\n\n\"I think it will have a dampening effect on public speech,\" said Pozner.\n\nGovernance experts say the incident should serve as a case study for corporate boardrooms.\n\n\"Every company in America that has a pending regulatory approval should be watching the case,\" said Bradley Akubuiro, a partner at leadership advisory firm Bully Pulpit International.\n\n\"The lesson isn't: Don't have political opinions. The lesson is: Understand when your company is at peak vulnerability and govern that accordingly. … Time really does matter.\"\n\nCompanies may be able to prevent directors from causing a similar kerfuffle, said Akubuiro, by enacting quiet periods during sensitive moments. These would be similar to how leaders are expected to clam up in the weeks leading up to companies' quarterly earnings reports.\n\n\"You just want to recognize that in a politicized moment, anything that's quasi-political can become a weapon, and folks will use that against you for maximum leverage,\" Akubuiro said.\n\nSimilarly, companies need defined communication policies that set expectations for directors, especially when regulatory stakes are high, and outline what to do if a board member goes off script, said Jennifer Schielke, CEO of the staffing firm Summit Group Solutions.\n\n\"The boardroom should be designed for robust dissent that is productive and private,\" she said.\n\nIn a fractious political environment, it's prudent for board members to get counsel and to consider the potential costs and benefits of what they say, said Jill E. Fisch, a professor of business law at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nYet, she added, \"That is completely different from being cowed into not saying anything.\"\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, is a Netflix board member.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Brian Thompson, 75, who lives in New Jersey. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nOn February 21, my wife and I traveled to Puerto Vallarta, just in time to miss a historic blizzard hitting the Jersey Shore.\n\nWhen we were planning this trip, it seemed like a good idea to miss a couple of winter weeks by traveling to Puerto Vallarta, where I'd visited twice before.\n\nPeople describe Puerto Vallarta as a little bit of paradise. Locals and tourists here are very friendly. It's a vibrant, bustling city with a great jazz scene.\n\nI'd never felt unsafe here until yesterday. I woke up in the morning and saw what I thought was pollution from automobile exhaust, but when I went down to the front door of the condominium, people said we were under attack by the cartel.\n\nAt first, we stayed in our unit because we were told to shelter in place. I went up to the condominium's front door to see what was going on, but I didn't go any further. I spent the next few hours communicating with family and friends who wanted to know if we were OK.\n\nLater on, I went out onto the pool deck and could see new fires and smoke, and a helicopter circling. I saw multiple videos online of vehicles being burned in the area.\n\nThe scariest part was hearing that the restaurant adjoining our building was on fire. Fortunately, it was quickly put out, but I could see smoke coming across our balcony.\n\nThis morning, it looks like things have calmed down. My wife struggled to fall asleep last night. I've been worried about her, but I've only felt a little bit scared. For the most part, my adrenaline was high. I've spent my career as a television journalist, and I'm used to running toward trouble. I decided to report on the events to my audience by sending information to my friends and people on X.\n\nWe spent last night with some other residents in the condo, and they shared their food with us.\n\nWhen my wife and I arrived on Saturday, we didn't have much food with us. I'd brought three protein bars with me, and we'd gotten a few items from a local store, including chips, guacamole, and yogurt. I haven't tried to leave the condo yet today. Whether I will or not depends partly on whether my wife will let me.\n\nWe planned to travel to Mexico City after spending a week in Puerto Vallarta, but we've canceled that leg of our trip.\n\nSo far, it's been hard to get flights out of the area. The earliest trips I've been able to find are on this Friday and Saturday, and I've booked trips back to the US through both Houston and Los Angeles.\n\nI'm hoping New Jersey will have dug itself out from the blizzard by Friday, but I haven't booked our travel from Houston to New Jersey because I don't even know if we'll make it to Houston.\n\nI don't know if we'll come back to Puerto Vallarta, but I hope we will. I want to come back to support the people of Puerto Vallarta and show faith in their country.\n\nDo you have a story to share about being stuck on holiday in Mexico?

    "fullText": "The AI-driven software sell-off that ravaged markets in early February isn't over, with IBM stock tanking on Monday as Anthropic unveiled another disruptive AI tool.\n\nIBM shares fell 13% after the maker of the Claude AI chatbot announced another new tool. In this case, the startup announced an update that can help reduce the cost of COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) systems used by many businesses.\n\nThe term may not be widely known outside the software industry, but it quickly sent IBM stock into a nosedive in the latest installment of the software sell-off.\n\nAnthropic announced the update in a blog post, laying out why COBOL matters and why people outside the tech community should care.\n\n\"COBOL is everywhere. It handles an estimated 95% of ATM transactions in the US,\" it wrote. \"Hundreds of billions of lines of COBOL run in production every day, powering critical systems in finance, airlines, and government. Despite that, the number of people who understand it shrinks every year.\"\n\nAmong its uses, the company said the new tool could \"Identify risks that would take human analysts months to surface.\" The new AI use case poses a potential threat to the kind of business data service that comprises a core part of IBM's business.\n\nAccording to the startup, Claude will allow companies to streamline their COBOL operations for a fraction of their previous cost, similar to the legal plugins the company rolled out early in the month that triggered the initial software sell-off.\n\n\"Legacy code modernization stalled for years because understanding legacy code cost more than rewriting it. AI flips that equation,\" Anthropic said in its post.\n\nTech stocks initially bounced back after Anthropic's legal plugin release spooked Wall Street and caused investors to rush to limit their legal tech exposure, but the market was selling off sharply again on Monday.\n\nEven before the Anthropic news hit IBM shares, the sector was tumbling earlier in the session as investors reacted to tariff uncertainty and a report making the rounds online that speculated about far-reaching negative impacts of AI.",

    "fullText": "Hannah Donovan is four months pregnant. And with two little ones already at home, she and her husband had been banking on one family trip before life got even more hectic.\n\nPuerto Vallarta was meant to be a babymoon — a chance to meet up with family nearby, soak up the sun, and actually relax for a few days.\n\nHowever, less than 24 hours before they were set to head to their airport in Idaho, videos and pictures of burning cars and billowing smoke began circulating on social media.\n\nDonovan said the images she saw online followed reports that Mexican forces carried out an operation on Sunday in Tapalpa, Jalisco, that killed Nemesio \"El Mencho\" Oseguera Cervantes, the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. The incident sparked retaliatory violence across multiple cities in Mexico, including in Puerto Vallarta.\n\nThe Donovans have since canceled their trip to Mexico and will play it by ear on whether they'll try to visit Puerto Vallarta later.\n\n\"We're incredibly grateful we're not there, but we're worried about the people who are, including travelers and our family who live there,\" Donovan, 28, told Business Insider. \"We're definitely a little traumatized by the situation.\"\n\nThe Donovans are among many Americans rethinking trips, moves, and stays in the region after chaos flared across parts of Mexico following the killing of Oseguera Cervantes on Sunday. Four people at the scene were killed, according to authorities. Three others — including Oseguera Cervantes — were wounded and later died, and two people were arrested. Three members of the armed forces were also wounded.\n\nIt comes after President Donald Trump designated the cartel a foreign terrorist organization. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the US provided intelligence support for the operation, but stopped short of offering details on how. The administration has prioritized cracking down on Latin American cartels, urging leaders to take a harder line and deploying military force against suspected drug-smuggling vessels in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean.\n\nIn the hours since, the US and Canadian governments have urged citizens in some areas to shelter in place, and said most domestic and international flights in Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta were grounded. On Monday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum called for calm in the country, but many of those flights remained canceled.\n\nMexico has become increasingly popular with American tourists, drawn by its vibrant nightlife, strong culinary scene, and affordability compared to other trendy international destinations such as France and Japan.\n\n\"Americans, especially on the West Coast, have long used it as an inexpensive place to go on vacation,\" Robin Ingle, a specialist in travel security, told Business Insider.\n\nMexico has also seen a surge in tourism from people who previously would have traveled to the US but are avoiding the country for various political or financial reasons, he said.\n\n\"A lot of the people I've spoken to over the weekend would have gone to places like Florida, California, Arizona — now they're going to Mexico instead,\" he said of the tourists he's spoken to since cartel violence broke out.\n\nBut as unrest spreads, some Americans who had planned to vacation or relocate there, or who are already in Mexico, are watching those plans unravel.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with three of them about what comes next.\n\nDoug Howell, a retired sales and distribution executive from the Spokane, Washington area, bought a rental place in Puerto Vallarta and now spends roughly six months a year there — a routine he's kept up for the past 20 years.\n\n\"It's very vibrant,\" Howell, 63, told Business Insider. \"I like to walk around the neighborhoods, everything is pretty close, or a short bus ride away if you want to check out the beaches or the waterfalls. There's always something to do, and the food is incredible.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Howell said he was standing on his balcony when he started hearing explosions, then saw plumes of smoke rising nearby. Before long, he said, he noticed highways and roads in and out of the area had been blocked off.\n\nHe was scared at first, he said, and hunkered down with neighbors.\"We just stayed inside all day yesterday, and I didn't go anywhere,\" he recalled. \"They actually bombed a store on a corner and a car on the bridge that's not even a quarter of a mile away.\"\n\n\"They're already on it today, and people are supporting each other in the community — that's what I like about it,\" he said. \"One question everybody asks me: Is it safe? And it's like, yeah, it is, unless you go to the wrong place at the wrong time. And that's anywhere in the world.\"\n\nFor now, Howell plans to stay in Mexico, but if things worsen, he said he plans to return to the States.\n\nLinda Armijo and her husband have been visiting Puerto Vallarta for the past 25 years.\n\nIn January, they returned for a three-month stay in the city's Marina Vallarta district, an upscale, waterfront area in northern Puerto Vallarta.\n\nArmijo said that on Sunday, after her husband's massage therapist warned that roads downtown were blocked, she went up to the rooftop terrace of their condo, which overlooks the city. From there, she said she could see five or six plumes of smoke.\n\nSmoke isn't entirely unusual in Puerto Vallarta — controlled burns are common — but Armijo said this was more than she typically sees. \"I came down to our condo and told Anthony, 'There's something going on, there are fires everywhere,'\" she recalled.\n\nArmijo said the city was hit by a series of disruptions, including the blast of an engine as a car was set on fire, interruptions to water service, and highways and roads blocked off. Although the uncertainty has left tourists and locals scrambling, they're relying on each other to get by.\n\n\"I met two girls from LA who are renting a condo upstairs. They were meant to fly out yesterday, and threw away all their food and supplies before learning their flight was canceled. I shared some water with them,\" Armijo said. She added that a building worker told her they were also accommodating those who needed to extend their stay.\n\nArmijo plans to stay put for now and said she isn't especially worried about her safety. Instead, she's thinking about what this could mean for the city.\n\n\"I feel safe in my building, and we have plenty of food and water,\" the Spanish-speaker said. \"It's a minor inconvenience not being able to leave, but my biggest emotions are sadness and concern for the people of Puerto Vallarta.\"\n\nIn the near term, Ingle, the travel security specialist, said he expects to see an impact on the tourism scene.\n\n\"I know there's going to be a blowback in the next month, people deciding not to go, because there's a percentage of the population that doesn't want to take risks,\" he said. \"Governments are putting out warnings, and that affects travel insurance.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the long-term impact, however, Ingle doesn't see this weekend's violence creating a lasting stain on Puerto Vallarta's ability to attract tourists.\n\n\"If all the violence dies down quickly and gets cleaned up, I think this will go away,\" Ingle said. \"Normally, this will take a couple days, and then it will fix itself.\"\n\n\"That doesn't mean it's without risk,\" he added.",

    "description": "The Air Force has been looking into what's possible with autonomous drones and how they can fight alongside advanced crewed aircraft.",
    "fullText": "A crewed US Air Force fighter and an uncrewed jet-powered aircraft flew together recently, communicating and showing how autonomous drones might fight in a future air war alongside human pilots.\n\nUS defense firm General Atomics, a competitor in the Air Force's Collaborative Combat Program aimed at developing and fielding loyal wingman-type drones, said on Monday that its MQ-20 Avenger, long a CCA stand-in, flew with an F-22 Raptor.\n\nDuring the test at Edwards Air Force Base earlier this month, the stealth fighter's pilot commanded the test drone to carry out tactical maneuvers, perform combat air patrols, and execute airborne threat engagement tasks.\n\nThe most recent demonstration is an advancement of a similar test in November 2025, when an F-22 pilot used a tablet to control an MQ-20, a test aircraft being used to demonstrate CCA-style teaming. The tablet allowed the pilot to communicate with the drone and send commands during flight.\n\nThe flight test earlier this month saw the Raptor pilot use government-provided autonomy software on the F-22 and a tactical data link to pass commands in real time to the drone.\n\n\"This demo featured the integration of mission elements and the ability of autonomy to utilize onboard sensors to make independent decisions and execute commands from the F-22,\" David Alexander, the president of General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc., said in a statement.\n\nGeneral Atomics said the latest demonstration showed how CCA-type platforms could increase the combat power available to human pilots in a future war.\n\nThe Collaborative Combat Aircraft program is a priority for the Air Force as a way to bolster American airpower. These drones are meant to fly alongside advanced fighters, including the coming sixth-generation F-47 being developed by Boeing.\n\nAir Force officials say CCAs aren't disposable, but they're cheaper than fighters like the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter. They are built to be attritable so they can be risked in combat instead of a human-piloted aircraft.\n\nTesting with the MQ-20 is helping inform the Air Force's CCA program, which is focused on General Atomics' YFQ-42, Anduril's YFQ-44, and Northrop Grumman's YFQ-48A. The air service envisions these systems as easily upgradable platforms compatible with high-end crewed aircraft.\n\nCCA-type drones, which include designs beyond those with dedicated Air Force program designations, are designed to carry out missions on their own, from air-to-air combat to strike and intelligence roles, while also boosting the power of a formation by adding more sensors and weapons without another pilot in the cockpit.\n\nThe Air Force says that CCAs are not intended as replacements for its crewed jets but are rather partners that will change how pilots work with artificial intelligence and drones — and expand US airpower in a fight, especially against a near-peer adversary.",

    "description": "Lou Cohen emphasizes AI's potential in marketing, urging marketers to leverage it for improved audience segmentation and ad efficiency.",
    "fullText": "Lou Cohen, EY's chief digital officer, said many marketers are not yet taking advantage of the benefits of artificial intelligence.\n\nCohen, who is also a professor at New York University, Yeshiva University, and Baruch College, said marketing is at an \"inflection point,\" with investment shifting from general digital innovation to AI transformation.\n\nCohen said that marketers who understand how to use AI in an assistive way, by focusing on what outcomes it delivers best, will access a deeper level of audience segmenting, targeting, and testing. He was interviewed for CMO Insider at Business Insider's studio in New York City.\n\nUltimately, Cohen said, the marketing function will embrace the new opportunity. \"Marketers, they're not afraid to try things,\" Cohen said. \"We're going to learn more from the things that we fail with and that don't work than the things that do.\"\n\nThe following transcript has been edited for clarity.\n\nWe are at an interesting inflection point. In today's marketing environment, you really need to understand how to make AI work for you; otherwise, you will end up working for it.\n\nThere are efficiency and operational gains to be had. But if you think about the outcomes that AI can enable from a marketing perspective, we could be smarter about how we segment our audiences for different campaigns. We could be more efficient in the ways our advertising runs. We could test more rapidly to get better-quality content in front of the right audiences at the right time in the right place.\n\nBut most marketing teams are not yet set up to take advantage of this potential. So the investments of the last 15 years in digital transformation are now shifting into AI transformation.\n\nIt's a bit unknown now. Marketers are not totally comfortable with this because we're so worried that it's going to hallucinate or give us something that isn't accurate. Marketers, they're not afraid to try things. We're going to learn more from the things that we fail with and that don't work than from the things that do.\n\nMy colleague came up with a great way to evaluate the quality of our content using AI. We can paste in an article that a partner of ours wrote, and it will give us recommendations on how to make that piece of content better. But we're never — I shouldn't say never — we're not likely to use content created by AI. But we certainly can use AI to enhance and give feedback to our content creators.\n\nHallucinations are real. The challenge is that as consumers of these technologies, we don't yet understand the difference between probabilistic and deterministic outcomes. Probabilistic is the likely correct response that the AI is trying to give us. Deterministic is \"one plus one equals two,\" and arguably, one plus one always equals two. \n\nWhen you're doing a search on Google or Bing, for example, you are getting a deterministic response. You're getting what it believes to be the likely to answer your question. Versus with the LLMs, the ChatGPTs, the Llamas, the Geminis of the world, you're getting a probabilistic response. The model is bringing a bunch of different sources together to determine the answer it thinks you should get based on your prompt.\n\nThat means if we were using these tools for their designed purpose, we'd still need search engines to just navigate to the things we're looking for, or to find the needles in the haystack of the internet. But LLMs give us a different opportunity. They can be assistants. That was some of the original idea behind these AI tools, to assist people in doing different tasks.\n\nI think of these LLMs more as marketing assistants to give me real-time ideas, feedback, or suggestions, rather than doing the task for me. That's a human putting AI to work to get better outcomes faster than if I were to just do it myself.",

    "title": "The best travel purses to use as your personal item on flights, according to a travel writer",
    "description": "As a fashion-forward travel writer, I use a travel purse way more than a carry-on backpack. Here are the most stylish crossbody travel bags I tested.",
    "fullText": "I'll admit, I'm one of the reasons the airport security line is moving so slowly. Once I reach the TSA agent, even if I've rehearsed the interaction for last 30 minutes, I always end up rummaging furiously through my travel tote, where my plane reads, passport, and random lip balms have all mixed.\n\nFinally, I switched over to a designated travel purse. I've found it to be much more useful than a travel backpack because I can wear it throughout my whole trip, rather than just at the airport. The best travel purses I tested have better storage options for a passport, phone, keys, and wallet, offering convenient access in a cute, wearable little package.\n\nFor more on the best personal items we love to travel with, see our guide to the best weekender bags and best carry-on luggage.\n\nTo find the stylish travel purses for staying organized, I tested 10 bags and wore each for at least 5 hours. I wore them in crowded urban areas, on road trips, and through hiking trails. I took note of how heavy they felt and how long it took me to grab things when I needed them, particularly at cash registers and while going through customs. Our team of editors have tested dozens of other crossbody bags on international flights and backcountry road trips, the best of which we added below.\n\nThe genius zippered vertical side pocket keeps everything organized. I wore this medium-sized crossbody bag for errand-filled city excursions, beach days, and a weekend cabin getaway. No other purse I tested felt so well-suited to such a range of environments.\n\nThe interior pockets are helpfully mesh-lined so I could see where everything was the moment I opened the bag. It's hard for me to choose a favorite pocket — there are so many smart ones, including the built-in card holder. \"My favorite part is its vertical zippered side pocket, where I can pull out my phone without taking the bag off my shoulder,\" writes senior associate style editor Gabrielle Chase.\n\nIt's lightweight, buttery soft, and comfy to carry all day. In addition to looking high-end, the leather feels silky-smooth and gentle on my skin. Even when I had the bag stuffed to maximum capacity, the wide adjustable strap lands really comfortably and evenly, never digging into my shoulder or back. It only weighs 10.8 ounces, which is impressive given the amount of storage options.\n\nIt can convert into three different bags. The adjustable, removable strap clicks into the body of the bag, allowing you to wear the Aoyama as a shoulder bag or even a clutch. Having one beautiful, adaptable bag that keeps me organized from the airport to a fancy dinner saves space in my suitcase. This kind of versatility makes the $248 price tag a bit more justifiable. There's also a nylon version that costs $178.\n\nRead \n\nIt's low-maintenance and machine-washable. Made of a durable-feeling recycled nylon, the fabric isn't what you might call \"luxury\"—rather, it's sporty and lightweight, which is far more important to me when I'm lugging suitcases and spilling coffee. Best of all for a messy, outdoorsy traveler like myself is that this Baggu is machine-washable.\n\nThe storage is simple and roomy. The Cargo Crossbody doesn't have as many specialized compartments as the other options I tested. Instead, there's just two exterior pockets and one interior zippered pocket. But the fact that the roomy interior is open gives me the option for all the other stuff I inevitably acquire while traveling. It can comfortably fit a wallet, sandwich, can of Diet Coke, a Nintendo switch, phone and a book, as I learned from my picnic in the park.\n\nIt comes in a variety of cute colors. Mine is a French blue, which adds a fun pop of color to any outfit (just because a bag is utilitarian and practical doesn't mean it has to be plain).\n\nI no longer have to root around in my bag for my phone. Before Bandolier, I'd yet to find an accessory that offers easy, fumble-free, repeated access to my phone, which I use constantly while traveling — checking reservations, looking at Google Maps, or filming my pasta like I'm an influencer.\n\nBandolier's sturdy leather phone case, which has a handy envelope for cards, upgraded my entire life. I can wearing my phone elegantly as a purse, with the crossbody strap clasped directly to the leather phone case. This made it so easy to grab and then \"put away,\" i.e. drop so it simply drapes across my body. The case clasps easily into Bandolier's expanded pouch, which can fit tickets, a thin wallet, a passport, keys, and a lip balm.\n\nThe materials and design feel expensive. Also, it is expensive. Both made of 100% leather, the Expanded Pouch is $98, and the Lily Duet (which is crossbody and wristlet phone case duo) costs $148. The sturdy pouch is a nice addition for a bit of extra storage, but you don't necessarily need to buy both: the phone case and detachable strap are enough.\n\nThe phone case itself is amazing. The back pocket card holder has a snap closure that keeps my credit card and ID secure and hidden. It's much safer than the exposed card holders I had before. I've made this my permanent phone case, whether traveling or not.\n\nThere are so many security features. The locking clasp straps are secure — they even take me a moment to undo when I'm just alone in my house, so I can't imagine how a thief would pull it off. I wore this bag through Times Square to get to a gynecologist appointment, and not for a second did I fear for the precious contents inside it (which included my anti-anxiety meds). Arden Cove makes it with \"slash-resistant lining\" and a hidden back zip pocket where I put my passport.\n\nIt can be worn in four ways. This Bum Bag's adjustable straps let me wear it as a belt bag, fanny pack, chest bag, or crossbody, which is ideal for crowded, high-traffic areas when I want my belongings as close to me as possible. The structure of the bag itself is less flexible than other options, but it allows you to keep everything close to the chest.\n\nThe storage is elite. I'm obsessed with its storage options, which includes two card holders that are perfect for subway cards, business cards, credit cards, IDs, and small tickets.\n\nIt's really comfortable. Away's simple design offers just the right amount of structure and slouch. It's made from a water-repellant polyester till feels cushiony and almost quilted. Even when I filled the bag with snacks, a big book, a Fuji camera, and my notebook, the padding around the strap prevented the bag from digging into my shoulders.\n\nIt has an impressive capacity. The Featherlight Crossbody weighs just over half a pound, yet has a storage capacity of 10 liters. I wore the bag on a bike trail along the Hudson River, to a Phillies game, and to Brighton Beach, where water and sand slid right off. It's also machine washable.\n\nThere are super useful hidden exterior pockets. I used the tiny one on the strap, which is perfect for AirPods or keys, and the other that's ideally sized for a passport and phone. These helped me avoid rummaging around in my bag in front of hotel receptionists and baristas.\n\nThere are so many ways to store things. I especially loved the convenience of the exterior magnetic-closure phone pocket. It has special compartments like card slots and pen loops, with loads of interior and exterior pockets for easy access to everyday items. I found myself constantly using the little loops for pens — a Godsend as mine are always scribbling on the bottom of my bags.\n\nIt looks cool. The Micah crossbody has a really distinctive, athletic look, with fun, chunky zippers. I felt really cool wearing it to yoga class and to the dog park. The 100% vegan material is made from 7 recycled plastic bottles, and it feels durable and sturdy.\n\nIt's lightweight and comfortable. It's can easily fit all the items I want while traveling — like documents, tablets, pens, books, and large headphones — but not something as large as a water bottle (for that, we suggest Dagne Dover's Sloan Sling instead).\n\nIt has a slim profile with a deceptively spacious main compartment. \"I toted it for a long day in New York City, and I appreciated that all my items were secured, but I knew exactly where to find them when I needed to,\" writes style contributor Talia Ergas.\n\nThere are eight pockets total, \"with organizational features galore designed with neat freaks like me in mind,\" says Talia. \"On the exterior, it has a front U-shaped pocket that offers a perfect compartment for stowing my cash and credit cards (in the leather card pocket), keys (via an easy access key leash), a pen (which stays secure thanks to a leather pen loop), and other quick-access items like a passport or tickets.\"\n\nIts lightweight design packs flat. Say you're wearing a backpack on the plane, but still want your Tumi Tyler Crossbody once you reach your destination. You can simply empty out the contents and the water resistant nylon exterior won't crumple, even if you have to smoosh it beneath the rest of your belongings.\n\nIt makes a trendy handbag into a practical purse. East-West bags — the long, skinny silhouette popularized by Alaia's $2,950 Le Teckel — can be horribly impractical. The slim body might be the trendiest shape right now, but I can't imagine squeezing travel essentials like sunscreen or snacks into a purse built like a pencil case. But the Gabrielle Shoulder Bag from Parisa Wang makes this purse trend practical. Not only is it supremely roomy, but it also has lots of functional features like quick-access pockets and handles that feel comfortable enough on your shoulder for all-day wear.\n\nThe elongated shape makes the purse incredibly spacious. I fit a hard-shell sunglass case, a 3.4-ounce bottle of sunscreen, a granola bar, a wallet, a pack of Band-Aids, two lipsticks, a claw clip, and all my little essentials like keys and AirPods in the purse with lots of room to spare. It also has two exterior pockets on either side of the bag, which are perfect for storing quick-access items like tickets or travel documents.\n\nIt works from day trips to dinner reservations. Lots of practical purses tend to lean too heavily into function at the cost of form. But this bag, with its smooth leather and minimalist look, would be chic enough for a stop at a Parisian wine bar after your walking tour. We all know the look of a tourist with their many-pocketed fanny pack, but this purse won't make you look like you came straight from a survivalist retreat. — Samantha Crozier, style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nMaria Yagoda, travel writer and style contributor: Maria is based in Brooklyn, where she covers travel and culture. It's where these two fields intersect that she's witnessed the latest style trends from across the globe. Whether she's flying to Italy or venturing upstate, Maria is intuiting which travel accessories are a worthy investment for most people in terms of convenience, comfort, and aesthetics.\n\nLearn how the Reviews team tests clothing, shoes, and accessories at Business Insider.\n\nStorage capacity: You want a travel purse that's small enough to not add bulk, but still has room inside for an umbrella, book, or souvenirs you pick up along the way. I found the ideal liter capacity for travel purses to be around 10 liters.\n\nSecurity features: Look for RFID-blocking compartments to protect your credit cards, and zippered closures. Crossbody bags offer a more secure fit that's harder to swipe off your person.\n\nWeight and adaptability: The more lightweight a travel purse is — and the more ways you can adjust its wide strap to distribute the weight — the more comfortable you'll be throughout your trip. Look for travel purses that weigh between 8 to 10 ounces.\n\nDurability: Look for machine washable, water-resistant materials (like nylon) especially if you'll be doing outdoorsy stuff.\n\nCompartments: Look for travel purses with horizontal and vertical zippered pockets on its interior, exterior, or even carrying strap.\n\nKAAI Rebel Crossbody ($575) This sporty, luxury-grade sling bag has a cool asymmetrical shape and is lined with a beautiful blue suede. Unfortunately it was too narrow and structured to fit anything bulky.\n\nQuince Italian Leather Convertible Crescent Shoulder Bag ($119) This is a well-made Italian leather purse that looks a lot like the very trendy Clare V. Moyen Messenger ($435). It's comfortable to wear, but the internal organization is somewhat minimal.\n\nCuyana Mini Paloma Bag ($398) It's elegant, compact, and has good organizational features, but was just a bit too small for my everyday carry. This one's better suited to minimalist travelers.\n\nCaraa Nimbus ($190) Design-wise, this bag has a very distinctive, cool look. It's kind of fluffy and cloud-like, so it could be used as a travel pillow if you're desperate. The storage space is really flexible and can accommodate quite a lot, but it only has three interior pockets.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

    "fullText": "The roar of Lamborghini's screaming V10 and V12 engines won't go silent.\n\nIn an interview with The Sunday Times, CEO Stephan Winkelmann said the Italian supercar maker has scrapped plans for its first all-electric model, the Lanzador, after consumer interest in high-priced EVs flattened to \"close to zero.\"\n\n\"EVs, in their current form, struggle to deliver this specific emotional connection,\" he told the Times, adding that engine noise is often a selling point for luxury sports cars. \"The decision was made after over a year of continuous internal discussion, engaging with customers, dealers, market analysis, and global data.\"\n\nLamborghini first announced the Lanzador EV in 2023, and the high-riding two-door coupe was scheduled to hit dealerships by 2029.\n\nWinkelmann said the car will now come to market as a plug-in hybrid instead.\n\nThe shift marks a notable recalibration for the Volkswagen-owned supercar brand. In 2021, Lamborghini laid out an electrification road map that was supposed to add a fully-electric car by the \"second half of the decade.\" The company said it wanted to cut its 2024 carbon emissions in half.\n\nWinkelmann told the Times that by 2030, its entire lineup will feature a gas engine and a battery that can be plugged into an electrical outlet.\n\nHe added that it will continue building internal combustion engines \"for as long as possible.\"\n\n\"Lamborghini is fully prepared for full electric,\" the company said in a statement to Business Insider. \"However, market readiness within the segment is not yet aligned with this transition.\"",

    "title": "AI-Generated Playlists, a New Look, and Other Changes Coming to Apple Music",
    "description": "The next big iPhone update will bring new features to the Apple Music app.",
    "fullText": "Your iPhone is likely currently running iOS 26.3 (assuming you've been keeping up with the operating system updates), but there's another version currently in the works over at Apple HQ. Right now, beta testers have their hands on iOS 26.4, which is shaping up to be a much bigger update than the last. Among the changes, Apple is debuting end-to-end encryption for RCS chats, so texts with Android users will no longer be insecure, and the Reminders app is getting an \"Urgent\" section for any entries you've labeled as such.\n\nBut perhaps no part of iOS is getting a larger update with 26.4 than Apple Music—both the app, and Apple's paid subscription service. Apple seems to have decided that Music needed a bit of a facelift, as well as some quality of life changes that will make the app and service easier to use. Whether you use Apple Music for streaming or you rely on it to store your digital library, you're going to notice the updates when iOS 26.4 drops in the near future. Some of these features will be free and some only available to paid subscribers; I've reached out to Apple to confirm which is which, and I will update this piece if I hear back.\n\nDo you like making playlists, or do you know someone who does? The robots are coming for your hobby, too. With iOS 26.4, Apple Music is rolling out \"Playlist Playground,\" a new feature that lets you generate playlists from natural language prompts. In layman's terms, that means you tell the AI what kind of music you want to hear, and it will generate a playlist from that request. That could something hyper-specific, like \"Taylor Swift country tracks,\" or something more general, like \"morning coffee vibes.\" The AI will choose 25 songs it thinks match your query. If it doesn't get it quite right, you can ask it to make changes, and you can change things yourself, like the playlist's title, description, and cover image.\n\nI'm interested to try this out, if for no other reason than music discovery: I like Apple Music's curated playlists already, but I am intrigued as to whether asking Apple's AI to select certain types of songs for me will help me find new music any better than the platform's human curators. I also don't think this will stop me from making my own playlists, or looking for playlists from friends. Sure, maybe the AI is good at picking 25 songs that match a specific theme, but there is an art to hand-picking tracks that work well together—plus, it's just fun.\n\nApple is far from the first company to roll out such a feature. YouTube Music recently launched something similar, while Spotify has two different AI playlist features (AI Playlist and Prompted Playlist) available on its platform.\n\nWhen you start exploring Apple Music after updating to iOS 26.4, you'll likely notice something right away: The UX, which is normally white or black (whether your iPhone is in light or dark mode) now matches the color scheme of the artwork for the album or playlist you're checking out. The effect is especially cool when the album art supports full-screen motion, like the following:\n\nApple has made some divisive design decisions in recent years, but I think this change is going to be a crowd pleaser. The difference between the current design on iOS 26.3 and the new look is stark, and, while there's nothing wrong with how things stand now, it already looks super dated next to the full-screen color matching designs.\n\nSpeaking of playlists, you can now add songs to multiple at once—just in case you still need some human intervention when it comes to these playlists. When you go to add a song to a playlist, you'll notice a new button in the bottom right. Tap it, and Apple Music opens up the ability to select multiple playlists at once, and send the song to all of them. It's a small change, but a helpful one, especially if you frequently add new music to more than one playlist at a time. I could see myself using this to add a song to my personal new discoveries playlist, as well as a shared playlist of new music I keep with friends.\n\nNot all music is made to active listening. If you use Apple Music for background music, especially when sleeping, working, or zoning out, you might be interested in the new \"Ambient Music\" widget, which lets you launch one of four different ambient playlists from the Home Screen: Sleep, which plays \"Sleep Sounds;\" Chill, which plays \"Today's Chill;\" Productivity, which plays \"Productivity;\" or Wellbeing, which plays \"Pure Meditation.\"\n\nI still can't quite shake the habit of relying on YouTube for my \"focus music\" needs, especially since these tracks mess with my Apple Music algorithms. But it might make sense to start relying on the platform I actually pay for when I want music to work or fall asleep to—unless that music is only available elsewhere.\n\nApple Music is also making it easier to listen to music outside of the app. The platform is rolling out a \"Concerts Near You\" section, which shows you artists playing in your area. You can see popular artists and their concert dates, as well as shows that are coming up this week. You can sort by both date and genre, and you can update the location when you want to know where shows are going to be in different areas.",

    "description": "The next Galaxy S Series is nearly here.",
    "fullText": "Whether you're a Samsung fan, an Android user, or just a tech enthusiast in general, you may want to clear your calendar: Samsung Unpacked 2026 is nearly here. Like Google I/O or Apple's fall event, Unpacked is Samsung's keynote, where the company shows off what it's been working on since, well, the last Unpacked. Like previous keynotes, this year's should be full of big Samsung news, all of which you can watch live as it happens.\n\nSamsung's big presentation will kick off in San Francisco on Wednesday, Feb. 25. Like many tech events, Galaxy Unpacked starts at 10 a.m. PT (1 p.m. ET).\n\nWhile Samsung is hosting a live presentation for a limited number of media and guests, anybody can tune into Galaxy Unpacked 2026 as it happens. The company is streaming the show from a number of websites, including Samsung.com, Samsung Newsroom, and Samsung's official YouTube channel. The YouTube livestream is currently up, but, of course, you won't see much until 1 p.m. ET on Wednesday.\n\nUsually, all we have is rumors and conjecture when reporting on what a company like Samsung will reveal during a big hardware event. We still need to do that in this case, but, that said, the company outright told us what its biggest announcement will be. When Samsung first announced Unpacked 2026 a couple weeks ago, it said that \"the new Galaxy S series is coming,\" which, no doubt, refers to the Galaxy S26. Samsung says this new series is \"built to simplify everyday interactions, inspire confidence, and make Galaxy AI feel seamlessly integrated from the moment it's in hand.\" Whatever that means.\n\nWe can look to rumors surrounding the S26 series to paint a picture of what to expect Wednesday. As it the norm, Samsung will likely release three main S26 units: the S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. It isn't clear whether the company will release an S26 Edge this year to follow up the S25 Edge.\n\nThe standard S26 seems like it'll be a small upgrade over the current S25, though with one key change: The new Galaxy will house its three rear cameras on a raised camera bump, following in the footsteps of Apple and Google. Rumors are split as to whether the cameras themselves will be upgraded, with some speculating that the Ultra will jump from 12MP to 50MP. The S26 may pack a 6.3-inch AMOLED display, a 4,300 mAh battery, up to 12GB of RAM, and possible up to 512GB of storage. Samsung may be running with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 to power the phone. The S26 Plus will likely be a similar phone, just with a larger 6.7-inch display.\n\nThe S26 Ultra looks like it'll launch with four rear cameras, with three of them contained to the bump out. As usual, the Ultra is the largest of the bunch, sporting a rumored 6.9-inch display. It could even be a bit thinner than the current S25 Ultra. The cameras may get some upgrades too, though the raw numbers appear to the same as the S25 Ultra. For example, while both may have 200MP main sensors, the S26's sensor may get some upgrades. It, too, could come with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip, as well as up to 16GB of RAM, up to 1TB of storage, a 5,000 mAh battery, and 60-watt fast wired charging.\n\nThe entire S25 series may also support 25W fast wireless charing, and may start selling a 25W Qi2 charger that supports it. They may all also support satellite communications, which would let users call and text emergency services and contacts without cellular network—similar to Apple's Emergency SOS via satellite on iPhone.\n\nSamsung will likely unveiled a new pair of earbuds Wednesday alongside the S26 series: Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 Pro. If the rumors are true, the Buds 4 will come in black and the Buds 4 Pro will come in white, though both will come with a charging case with a transparent lid. Besides color, the other big difference here is how the buds fit: The Buds 4 Pro are rumored to come with silicone tips, like AirPods Pro, while the Buds 4 do not, like Apple's standard AirPods.\n\nFinally, expect some big AI announcements, especially as they pertain to the S26 series. In a press release on Sunday, Samsung announced an \"expansion of Galaxy AI\" to support \"a choice of integrated agents.\" Specifically, Samsung is partnering with Perplexity to bring its AI agents to Galaxy devices. You'll be able to say \"Hey Plex\" to access the agent, and the bot will work across Samsung apps, like Calendar, Clock, Gallery, Notes, and Reminder.\n\nAt the same time, the company is currently testing the latest version of its own assistant, Bixby, with One UI 8.5. The goal is to let users ask Bixby for things on their Galaxy device, such as \"I don't want the screen to shut off when I'm looking at it,\" and the bot will adjust the proper settings in kind. The new Bixby can also access the web to answer questions, similar to other AI bots like ChatGPT or Gemini. Expect to hear more about this during Unpacked as well.",

    "description": "British number one Jack Draper marks his post-injury return to action on the ATP Tour with a straight-set win over Frenchman Quentin Halys at the Dubai Tennis Championships.",
    "fullText": "British number one Jack Draper said he felt \"really proud\" after marking his post-injury return to action on the ATP Tour with a straight-set victory over Frenchman Quentin Halys in Dubai.\n\nCompeting on the men's tour for the first time since the US Open last August, Draper won 7-6 (10-8) 6-3 on his debut at the Dubai Tennis Championships.\n\nThe 24-year-old, who has slipped to 15th in the world after reaching a career-high ranking of fourth in June, will play Hungary's Fabian Marozsan or France's Arthur Rinderknech next.\n\n\"I've been craving the feeling of competing for a very long time,\" Draper said in his post-match interview.\n\n\"It just felt normal, it felt like I was coming back to doing what I love, which is being out here, competing and having the adrenaline of winning and losing points.\n\n\"A lot of people have helped me to get back to this position after a lot of down moments [during] the last eight months.\n\n\"It's not been easy to be back here and that's something I can be really proud of. Long may it continue.\"\n\nDraper contested his first competitive match for 164 days when he played at the Davis Cup qualifiers earlier in February, beating Norway's Viktor Durasovic in straight sets.\n\nBut he had remained absent from tour singles competition since withdrawing from the US Open before his second-round match because of a left arm injury six months ago.\n\nDraper won the prestigious Masters 1,000 title at Indian Wells and reached the fourth round of the Australian and French Opens in a promising start to his 2025 season.\n\nBut he began struggling with a bruised bone in his service arm during the clay-court swing in April, and the issue progressively worsened.\n\nDetermined to complete a full recovery from the issue, Draper took the decision to miss the Australian Open in January before making his return for Great Britain on 5 February.\n\nSeeded fourth in Dubai, Draper had to withstand a set point when serving at 5-4 down in the opening set but went on to edge a tight tie-break by winning three consecutive points to overcome an 8-7 deficit.\n\nDespite first-set opportunities for both players, the first break of serve in the contest did not arrive until the fourth game of the second set when the 68th-ranked Halys hit wide to give Draper a 3-1 lead.\n\nDraper served out victory untroubled from there, conceding just two further points on serve as he ending the match with an impressive 86% win rate on his first serve.\n\nThe left-hander's successful recovery from injury was also underlined by the fact 19 of his 24 winners flew off his previously affected forehand side.\n\nThe post-victory celebration might have been reserved - a solemn face only briefly breaking into half a smile - but Draper will be delighted with his ATP Tour return, make no mistake.\n\nAn absence of nearly six months has undoubtedly been difficult for Draper to deal with.\n\nPulling out of January's Australian Open showed the severity of the bruised humerus on his dominant left arm - the bone running from the shoulder to the elbow - and the necessity to avoid any risks.\n\nSo too did the decision to withdraw from the ATP tournament in Rotterdam earlier this month.\n\nSome saw that move, coming after making his comeback with a routine Davis Cup win, as a red flag.\n\nFor Draper, though, it was all about playing the long game with a career which has been characterised by injury.\n\nBut there was no holding back against Halys. A pair of flaying forehands in the first two points of the match set the tone, followed by a booming ace at the start of an opening service game where he found his range with four out of five first serves.\n\nDraper was wearing a protective compression sleeve on the affected arm, but he continued to play freely and fluently from the baseline.\n\nIt has been clear for a while there is not a straightforward fix with an injury of this nature.\n\nGenerally speaking, the fear with a bruised humerus is the problem could lead to a more serious stress fracture with continued repetition and torsional stress - which tennis players clearly face.\n\nPatience has become a virtue which Draper has needed to learn - and, while this was an impressive return, he may still need more of it in the weeks and months ahead.\n\nLive scores, results and order of play\n\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Striker Benjamin Sesko and goalkeeper Senne Lammens are the key figures as Manchester United gain a hugely valuable Premier League win at Everton.",
    "fullText": "Michael Carrick had a neat way of describing Benjamin Sesko's assimilation into life at Manchester United.\n\n\"He is growing as a player,\" said United's head coach. \"Sometimes it's big steps, sometimes it's little steps. He has taken some huge ones recently.\n\n\"The confidence and belief he is playing with is great to see.\"\n\nThe mighty strides Sesko has taken in United's latest two games have placed the club in a superb position to cement a return to the Champions League after a two-year absence.\n\nWithout the Slovenian's contributions off the bench, United would have lost at West Ham on 10 February and drawn with Everton on Monday on their first visit to Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\nSesko's goals have put Carrick's men out on their own in fourth spot, three points behind Aston Villa and three ahead of Chelsea and Liverpool.\n\nIf his stoppage-time volley to earn a point at West Ham was a thing of aesthetic beauty, his latest effort in the 71st minute of the 1-0 win at Everton was a feat of physical excellence.\n\nIt was a combination of endurance, running 70 yards at top speed after laying off a pass to Matheus Cunha, and calmness, to steady himself and coolly slot home Bryan Mbeumo's square pass.\n\n\"It was a great finish, a ruthless finish,\" said Carrick. \"I like the way he put it away with real confidence.\"\n\nWatching the game for Sky Sports, former Liverpool and England defender Jamie Carragher looked at the goal admiringly.\n\n\"Sesko has gone over 80 yards and then finishes,\" Carragher said. \"You expect him to be breathing heavily and panting after that. But no, he still has the energy to really celebrate.\"\n\nSesko has taken his goals tally to eight for the season.\n\nRemarkably, he only scored twice under Ruben Amorim, who signed him from RB Leipzig for £73.7m in August 2025.\n\nNow he has six in his latest seven games, starting with three in two matches while Darren Fletcher was in interim charge after Amorim's dismissal at the start of January.\n\nThat return has led many observers to feel Sesko is unlucky not to have made the starting XI for any of the six games Carrick has had at the helm.\n\nUnited's boss understands the debate. But he doesn't feel it is especially important.\n\n\"I get why everyone is talking about it and making a big deal of it, but it is not always as extreme,\" he said.\n\n\"I have got a really good relationship with Ben. We have had some good conversations, and he is in a good place.\n\n\"He obviously wants to play, but we have got some good forwards and I can't speak highly enough of how he has been.\"\n\nFor Sesko, it is about delivering when his manager asks – and he is brimming with the confidence to do that.\n\n\"I believe in me and so do the other players,\" Sesko told Sky Sports.\n\n\"They know what they are going to get when I arrive in the game. Whether that is five minutes or 90 minutes, it doesn't really matter. It's about showing I can deliver if I possibly can and I'm really happy with that.\"\n\nSesko comes off bench to score Man Utd winner at Everton\n\n'I'm not Schmeichel in disguise - I am just Senne Lammens'\n\nWho has made Troy's Premier League team of the week?\n\nIf Sesko broke Everton's hearts at one end of the field, another summer recruit, Senne Lammens, did it at the other.\n\nThe Belgian goalkeeper kept out a blockbuster strike from Michael Keane, which Moyes felt sure was going in, then dealt superbly with a series of corners dropped under his crossbar as Everton literally tried to force an equaliser.\n\n\"Their goalie was brilliant tonight,\" was Moyes' blunt reaction.\n\n\"The save he made from Michael, the way he dealt with corner kicks. The pressure we had. For me, their goalkeeper was the best player.\"\n\nCarrick is the one who benefits though, just as he is benefiting from the decision of United's recruitment department to block Amorim's calls to bring in Emi Martinez from Aston Villa on summer transfer deadline day and instead place their faith in a relatively young £18.1m goalkeeper with just one full season of senior football in Belgium behind him.\n\nLammens is 23. Sesko is 22. United might not quite be winning trophies with kids, but they have a young generation that is beginning to blossom.\n\nIt was brought to Carrick's attention after the Everton game that his former United team-mate and all-time great goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar was analysing the game on TV with Carragher.\n\nCarrick skilfully navigated the question of whether there are comparisons to be drawn between the two men.\n\n\"I've got to be careful what I say,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't want to be comparing them because I don't think it's fair to Senne. But there's definitely similarities.\n\n\"You want a goalkeeper to be reliable and trustworthy. Instead of creating a chaos, you want him to take the chaos away and calm things down. I think Senne is that.\n\n\"He's quite quiet at times and unassuming, but he's got real steel. It's a big role for some, and it's about being comfortable in your environment.\n\n\"Sometimes it takes time, sometimes not, but he has that calmness and composure. It helps those in front of him an awful lot.\"\n\nAt the start of the season, United's stated aim was to get back into Europe.\n\nEven internally, it was felt reaching the Europa League was the most realistic target, and financial estimates were created around that.\n\nHowever, in the wake of Amorim's exit, director of football Jason Wilcox spoke to the players about reaching the Champions League.\n\nThe difference in status and finance is huge.\n\nUnited have now gone 10 consecutive Premier League games without defeat for the first time since a run of 14 between January and May 2021 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\n\nFrom their current position, with no European distractions, which is something Villa, Chelsea and Liverpool all have, it would be a major disappointment for them if United were not to seal a return to European football's top table.\n\n\"Manchester United are now virtually guarantees for one of the Champions League places,\" said Carragher. \"I can't see them not making it.\"\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Boxing greats Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather have agreed a professional rematch in September.\n\nPacquiao, 47, and Mayweather, 48, will fight at Sphere in Las Vegas on Saturday, 19 September, with the bout live on Netflix.\n\nFormer world champion Mayweather announced he would come out of retirement for a fourth time last week.\n\nIt will be the American's first professional fight since beating mixed martial arts fight Conor McGregor with a 10th-round technical knockout in 2017.\n\nFilipino Pacquiao retired from the sport to focus on his political career in 2021 but returned to the ring last July to fight WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios, who retained his title after a draw.\n\nMayweather and Pacquiao first met in 2015, in what was billed as the 'Fight of the Century' and remains the richest in boxing history.\n\nIt was Mayweather who emerged victorious, beating Pacquiao via a wide unanimous decision in Las Vegas.\n\nIt is not yet known over how many rounds or at what weight class the rematch will be contested.\n\nPacquiao, winner of 12 world titles across eight weight classes, said: \"Floyd and I gave the world what remains the biggest fight in boxing history.\n\n\"The fans have waited long enough. They deserve this rematch.\n\n\"I want Floyd to live with the one loss on his professional record and always remember who gave it to him.\"\n\nMayweather, who turns 49 on Tuesday, said: \"I already fought and beat Manny once. This time will be the same result.\"\n\nMayweather has won all 50-0 of his professional fights, with 27 coming by knockout.\n\nHe has had a string of exhibition bouts since retiring in 2017 and is scheduled to face Mike Tyson this year.\n\nThat is set to be former undisputed world heavyweight champion Tyson's first fight since the American ended his 19-year retirement in November in a controversial defeat by Youtuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul.\n\nAnnouncing the end of his retirement on Saturday, Mayweather said: \"From my upcoming Mike Tyson event to my next professional fight afterwards: no-one will generate a bigger gate, have a larger global broadcast audience and generate more money with each event than my events.\"\n\nPacquiao, who has 62 wins from his 73 bouts, said in October that the pair were close to agreeing a rematch – but added it was dependent on he and Mayweather being able to \"understand each other\".\n\nTheir previous meeting in 2015 generated a record 4.6 million pay-per-view buys and a record live gate of $72m at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.\n\nFull details regarding the undercard and ticket availability will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nWhat a chaotic few days it's been for boxing. After Conor Benn's shock move to Zuffa, the sport has barely had time to reset. But perhaps nothing in boxing should shock us any more.\n\nThe first Mayweather-Pacquiao fight was the one everyone demanded for years, yet when it finally arrived in 2015, it had come too late. And then it never lived up to the billing.\n\nSince then, nobody really has been clamouring for a rematch. Certainly not in 2026.\n\nWhen the rematch was announced, most boxing fans on social media assumed this would be an exhibition. It isn't.\n\nThe finer details are still unclear but if there are any special rules or conditions attached, that's unlikely to go down well with purists.\n\nThere is one hook: Mayweather putting his unbeaten record on the line. And with Netflix involved, you can expect the full promotional treatment - it will be sold as a global event for the casual sports fan.\n\nUltimately, both men will bank enormous purses for revisiting old ground, and it's hard to escape the feeling that this is being driven more by the money than anything else.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Italian cricket is in crisis days after the country's T20 World Cup debut, as it emerged that a senior national governing body official has been investigated over a sexual assault allegation.\n\nFederazione Cricket Italiana (FCRI) women's cricket co-ordinator Prabath Ekneligoda, 57, was the subject of a criminal investigation relating to a claim he inappropriately touched a member of the Azzurri women's national team.\n\nMultiple members of the Italy board are said to have resigned over this case and other governance issues, BBC Sport has been told.\n\nThe sexual assault allegation was made to police in Rome in March last year by a player who has represented the national team.\n\nThe player, whose identity is protected for legal reasons, alleged that the sexual assault occurred during a massage on a knee injury at a training session, and she had been scared to report the incident because she feared it would cost her a spot in the team.\n\nAn investigation was concluded by a Rome prosecutor in November 2025 and Ekneligoda was interviewed by police the following month.\n\nA decision is now set to be made on whether there is sufficient evidence to bring it to trial. Ekneligoda's lawyer said his client denies the allegation, that there are ulterior motives to the allegation, and that a witness supports his version of events.\n\nFCRI said in a statement to BBC Sport it \"noted proceedings are currently under way before the federal prosecutor's office\" and will \"co-operate with the relevant authorities\".\n\n\"The Italian Cricket Federation reiterates that its conduct is guided by principles of fairness, transparency and the protection of its registered members, as well as by the ethical and civic standards that underpin the sporting system,\" added the statement.\n\n\"The federation therefore defers to the competent judicial authorities for any determinations arising from the matter.\"\n\nEkneligoda, who is originally from Sri Lanka, was suspended from his role with the FCRI in November but has remained a visible presence on the Italian cricket scene.\n\nHe is the partner of FCRI president Maria Lorena Haz Paz and accompanied her to India for the men's T20 World Cup.\n\nBBC Sport has seen evidence that Ekneligoda attended Italy's matches wearing official accreditation and was permitted to sit with the rest of the FCRI party.\n\nEkneligoda was also seen at various events laid on for Italy's cricket delegation, including a reception at the Italian consulate in Kolkata for officials, players and coaching staff.\n\nThe FCRI, its president Haz Paz, and safeguarding officers, had full knowledge of the seriousness of the claim made against Ekneligoda before the World Cup.\n\nLast weekend, Il Messaggero, external and Corriere della Sera, external reported the allegation in the Italian media for the first time.\n\nAs of Monday, Ekneligoda was still listed as the women's cricket coordinator on the FCRI website.\n\nSources have told BBC Sport that some members of the FCRI's board have resigned over the matter, and other governance issues, which has placed Haz Paz's position under greater scrutiny.\n\nSenior officials in Italian cricket fear potential reputational damage, and the possibility of legal cases, will hamper opportunities to capitalise on their debut T20 World Cup appearance and grow the game further in the country.\n\nHaz Paz was appointed president of the Italian cricket federation in February 2025 until 2028.\n\nItaly's debut at the T20 World Cup, and the stories of some of their players, had captured the imagination of the cricket world.\n\nThe Azzurri failed to make the Super 8 stage but beat Nepal in Mumbai and gave England a scare in Kolkata in their Group C fixtures.\n\nIPL-linked teams 'not considering Pakistan players'\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\n\n'It smacks of England' - Australia fail again at T20 World Cup",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nDean Henderson (Crystal Palace): Not a great weekend for goalkeepers in terms of the shots faced. But a penalty save and a clean sheet against a poor Wolves team was big for Crystal Palace who really needed that win.\n\nVirgil van Dijk (Liverpool): People have been questioning whether he or John Terry is the better Premier League centre-back. For me, Van Dijk is just a Rolls-Royce and the two of them go in the same category. He delivers all the time and has started to make Milos Kerkez look better with his organisation. It was a tough game against Forest but he stood up and delivered.\n\nHarry Maguire (Manchester United): Mr Dependable. I was going to put Luke Shaw in but Harry just got the nod. Manchester United are on a great run under Michael Carrick and look like they are continuing to be a solid team, and Maguire being fit and available has coincided with that. He was great for Ruben Amorim and now he's great again. Not so long ago, they were trying to shift him out for anything and now he is the Guvnor.\n\nLewis Hall (Newcastle): I had to find a place for him because he has been fantastic over the course of the Premier League and even though his goal against Manchester City was a deflected strike, I just thought he was brilliant.\n\nNico O'Reilly (Manchester City): The player of the weekend for me, and the player of the month by a country mile. Since O'Reilly has moved into that midfield, Rodri has looked better, Manchester City have looked better, he has looked amazing and the job he has done for the past 18 months at left-back shows his versatility. What a player. Both his goals against Newcastle were great and totally different. He offers so much to Manchester City and is a shoo-in for the England squad. We were looking at him as a left-back but does he now play midfield?\n\nAnton Stach (Leeds): I thought Leeds might falter and fall away. I think they have to be careful with these draws but he was a really good performer against Aston Villa - and that free-kick he scored against a World-Cup winning goalkeeper in Emi Martinez means he goes in my team.\n\nEberechi Eze (Arsenal): He has to go in this week with his two goals against Spurs on Sunday. He has scored five goals against them now in two games - so Spurs are obviously his team to face. Good for him and good for Mikel Arteta to pick him. He has been up and down this season, in and out of the team, but this will be a real confidence booster for him and Arsenal.\n\nDiego Gomez (Brighton): He got a goal in the win against Brentford, but it was also an important midfield performance from him. Brentford weren't at their best, with injuries in the squad, but you have to be able to break through the lines and he did that a lot. He was fantastic. It was Brighton's first win in seven league games and they needed it.\n\nZian Flemming (Burnley): Yes, he scored against Chelsea, but it was an old-school number nine performance. I have got a lot of time for this sort of display. He was horrible, he was beating people up, making little fouls, and was a real nuisance. He was doing it to the point where Chelsea were getting so frustrated, he was probably part of the reason why Wesley Fofana got sent off.\n\nViktor Gyokeres (Arsenal): He scored two against Spurs. Yes, the opposition were mediocre with a terrible backline but he doesn't care. The rest of his play was better as well. I can't give him too much credit, but you can only score against the teams put in front of you.\n\nRaul Jimenez (Fulham): He goes through these spells when he scores a run of goals and he looks a real top player. Then he goes quiet again. He scored another couple of goals at Sunderland on Sunday - he is a big powerful player, and the one thing you know is he is going to work that backline on his own.\n\nMikel Arteta (Arsenal): It was a big week for the Arsenal manager. With Manchester City winning, there was a lot of pressure on his team going into the north London derby against a poor Spurs team. Arsenal had to handle the pressure and they did that very well. I give Arteta all the credit. He is handling it every step of the way.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?
