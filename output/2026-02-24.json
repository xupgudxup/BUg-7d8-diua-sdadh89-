    "fullText": "Manchester United climbed into the Premier League top four with a hard-earned 1-0 victory over Everton, as Benjamin Sesko’s second-half strike proved decisive at the Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\nMichael Carrick’s side arrived knowing that three points would move them above Chelsea, and they delivered in a contest short on quality but rich in significance.\n\nUnited began brightly and almost took an early lead when Amad Diallo’s low effort was parried by Jordan Pickford before James Tarkowski cleared off the line.\n\nEverton responded with energy but struggled to carve out clear openings against a disciplined visiting back line.\n\nJames Garner tested Senne Lammens with a dipping free-kick before the interval, yet clear-cut chances remained limited.\n\nThe first half was defined by intensity rather than incision, with both sides cancelling each other out in midfield.\n\nEverton started the second period with greater urgency and Harrison Armstrong forced a sharp save from Lammens inside the opening minute.\n\nUnited gradually regained composure and Bryan Mbeumo spurned a promising opportunity when he volleyed over from close range.\n\nCarrick turned to his bench just before the hour mark, introducing Sesko in search of greater penetration.\n\nThe substitution proved decisive 13 minutes later with a swift counter-attacking move.\n\nMatheus Cunha initiated the break with a forward pass into space for Mbeumo, who drove at the retreating defence.\n\nMbeumo waited for support and delivered a precise ball into the path of Sesko, who had sprinted from deep.\n\nThe Slovenian striker applied a composed first-time finish beyond Pickford to register his eighth goal of the season.\n\nEverton pushed forward in response and Michael Keane unleashed a powerful effort that was tipped over by Lammens.\n\nThe hosts continued to press in the closing stages but United defended resolutely to preserve their narrow advantage.\n\nSesko had an opportunity to add a second late on but failed to control cleanly when sent through on goal.\n\nThe final whistle confirmed a vital away win that strengthens United’s Champions League ambitions.\n\nCarrick’s men now sit fourth, overtaking Chelsea and building momentum at a crucial stage of the campaign.\n\nThe defeat extends Everton’s frustrating run at home and leaves them searching for consistency.\n\nSesko’s timely intervention once again proved the difference in a tightly contested encounter for United.",

The franchise also has interest in Alabama signal-caller Ty Simpson in April's draft.\n\n\"Packers backup quarterback Malik Willis and Alabama’s Ty Simpson are among the external quarterbacks on the Browns’ radar with the NFL Combine kicking off Tuesday and free agency starting in two weeks,\" Cabot said.\n\nSigning Willis would be a savvy move by general manager Andrew Berry.\n\nWillis has done a terrific job filling in for Jordan Love over the last two seasons, showcasing his efficiency with a 78.7% completion rate on 89 passes with Green Bay.\n\nThe Liberty product possesses a dynamic skillset that head coach Todd Monken can maximize. Monken coached Lamar Jackson with the Baltimore Ravens for three seasons, so he knows a thing or two about working with mobile quarterbacks.\n\nSpotrac projects Willis will land a $71 million contract over two seasons in free agency, an average annual value of $35.5 million. That would be a hefty price point, but one Cleveland would pay if they believe Willis can be their quarterback of the future.\n\nRams $44 million cut candidate could land with Bills, Patriots, Steelers\n\nKyle Pitts rumor is bad news for Giants, Commanders, Eagles, Broncos\n\nFalcons rumor could lead to trade with Steelers, Dolphins or Jets\n\nMaxx Crosby rumor gives Bills, Cowboys, Eagles, Pats minimum trade price\n\nRumor from NFL Network reveals Browns' interest in top free agent",

    "fullText": "Manchester United boss Michael Carrick praised the impact of super-sub Benjamin Sesko after the Slovenian's cool finish earned a 1-0 win at Everton on Monday night.\n\nSesko is yet to start in Carrick's six matches in charge but has come off the bench to net in three of his last four appearances with vital goals.\n\nThe 22-year-old also scored a late winner against Fulham and rescued a point against West Ham deep into stoppage time in United's previous outing.\n\nSesko started the move that led to the winning goal as all of United's £200 million ($270 million) trio of attacking signings last summer combined to great effect.\n\nMatheus Cunha picked out the run of Bryan Mbeumo, who squared for Sesko to slot home his sixth goal in seven appearances since Ruben Amorim was sacked in January.\n\nVictory lifted United into the Premier League's top four, three points clear of Liverpool and Chelsea in the battle for a place in next season's Champions League.\n\n\"It was a ruthless finish, I like the way he put it away with real confidence,\" said Carrick, who has five wins and one draw since taking charge at Old Trafford.\n\n\"Great play from Matheus and Bryan to set it up. Delighted for Ben again, coming on and making the difference.\"\n\nUnited did not hit the height of sparkling performances to beat title challengers Arsenal and Manchester City in Carrick's first two matches in charge during an uninspired clash at the Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\nBut the former Middlesbrough boss was delighted with a third clean sheet in six games.\n\nUnited had held opponents goalless just twice in 29 matches this season before Carrick's arrival.\n\n\"We had to do a lot of work. Credit to Everton they made it difficult, made us defend our box a lot. The spirit with which we defended the box was top class,\" added Carrick.\n\nGoalkeeper Senne Lammens made a couple of vital saves to continue an impressive debut season at United for the 23-year-old Belgian.\n\n\"Senne was oustanding tonight,\" said Carrick. \"You couldn't hope for much more from a goalkeeper. It was an exempalary performance, so delighted for him.\n\n\"You want (a goalkeeper) to take the chaos away and Senne is that. That calmness and composure helps those in front of him.\"",

    "description": "In an article naming possible landing spots for a projected $71 million quarterback, the Pittsburgh Steelers, Minnesota Vikings and Arizona Cardinals were mentioned.",
    "fullText": "Steelers, Vikings, Cardinals named possible landing spots for $71 million quarterback originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThere are going to be plenty of teams in the market for a quarterback this offseason, and among them could be the Pittsburgh Steelers, Minnesota Vikings and Arizona Cardinals.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, the Steelers still don't have an answer on Aaron Rodgers. If he doesn't come back, the Steelers need to make an addition to a quarterbacks room that would include the unproven Will Howard and backup Mason Rudolph.\n\nThe Vikings have J.J. McCarthy under contract, but he failed to cement himself as the team's locked-in starter for the long haul after a poor second season. As a result, the expectation is the Vikings are going to at least add veteran competition.\n\nAs for the Cardinals, it appears Kyler Murray's days are numbered. If he is shown the door, we would bet Arizona won't be keen on staking its future to the Jacoby Brissett wagon, no matter how well he played in 2025.\n\nOne quarterback who could be the most coveted in free agency is Green Bay Packers signal-caller Malik Willis. On SI's Ethen Hutton believes the Steelers, Cardinals and Vikings are all possible landing spots for him.\n\n\"Willis projects to be a sound fit in Minnesota’s talented offense under quarterback-friendly coach Kevin O’Connell. Monitoring his fantasy football outlook, his stock would take a sizable leap with Jefferson and Addison on the perimeter,\" Hutton said of Willis to the Vikings. \"His consistency as a passer will help elevate the Vikings’ offense, with significant upside among fantasy entering the 2026 season. His rushing upside will also pair well with the likes of Aaron Jones and Jordan Mason in the run game, bolstering the rushing attack.\"\n\n\"In Pittsburgh, Willis would join an offense featuring DK Metcalf and a talented tight end trio featuring the likes of Pat Freiermuth, Darnell Washington and Jonnu Smith,\" he said of Willis to Pittsburgh. \"He’d also add a new dynamic to the Steelers’ backfield tandem of Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell. From a fantasy football perspective, his stock would take a sizable leap in Pittsburgh, filling the team’s need for a franchise quarterback. His outlook is highly encouraging for fantasy managers as Willis gears up for his first season as a starter.\"\n\n\"Willis fits Arizona’s offense system under new head coach Mike LaFleur, the brother of Packers head coach Matt LaFleur, as the team looks to bring in another mobile quarterback,\" Hutton said of the Liberty product going to Arizona. \"From a fantasy football standpoint, the Cardinals offer one of the best supporting casts of any team on our list, bolstering Willis’ fantasy stock immensely for the 2026 season. With Willis set to take over a starting job, he’s slated to break out in fantasy football next season. The Cardinals’ weapons could help Willis emerge as one of fantasy’s top quarterbacks next season, with additional upside as a rusher in LaFleur’s offense.\"\n\nA former third-round pick of the Tennessee Titans, Willis looked like he was going to be a bust after two years in the NFL. Then, a trade to the Packers changed everything.\n\nWillis didn't see a ton of action while serving as Jordan Love's backup, but he no doubt made the most of his opportunities and looked like a completely different quarterback than the one we saw in Nashville.\n\nHe showed he can make all the throws, and with accuracy, and his decision-making and pocket presence was top notch. As an added bonus, Willis has plus-athleticism to escape the rush.\n\nWillis doesn't come without some risk, though.\n\nWe believe Willis will command something close to what Spotrac projects, which is a two-year, $71 million contract. That might seem crazy for a guy with just six career starts, but he should enough promise to warrant that kind of money.\n\nEssentially Sports' Tony Pauline reports that many around the league believe Willis is going to end up with the Cardinals, so Arizona is a realistic possibility, assuming they do indeed cut or trade Murray.\n\nThe Steelers' interest in Willis will depend upon what happens with Rodgers, but if the future Hall of Famer doesn't return, we believe Pittsburgh would be willing to take a swing on Willis.\n\nWhen it comes to the Vikings, reports suggest they would like to sign a veteran quarterback, but we would not rule Minnesota out from pursuing Willis if head coach Kevin O'Connell believes he can be an upgrade over McCarthy.\n\nKyle Pitts rumor is bad news for Giants, Commanders, Eagles, Broncos\n\nFalcons rumor could lead to trade with Steelers, Dolphins or Jets\n\nMaxx Crosby rumor gives Bills, Cowboys, Eagles, Pats minimum trade price\n\nRumor from NFL Network reveals Browns' interest in top free agent\n\nCardinals believed to be most likely landing landing spot for $71M QB",

    "fullText": "Fairhope (Ala.) St. Michael Catholic four-star quarterback Gunner Rivers is following in his father’s legendary footsteps.\n\nThe son of former NFL star and future Hall of Famer Philip Rivers has committed to NC State, choosing to join the Wolf Pack 26 years after his father did back in 2000. Gunner chose NC State over reported offers from Auburn, Georgia, Miami, Boston College and more.\n\nOne of the top quarterbacks nationally in the 2027 class, Rivers has long been thought of as a lean to the school where his father won ACC Player of the Year honors in 2003 and Rivers broke almost every NC State and ACC passing record.\n\nGunner himself has had a record-breaking high school career and is coming off a junior season where he completed 208 of 290 passes (72%) for 2,813 yards, 44 touchdowns and just five interceptions. In the process, he led St. Michael Catholic to a 13-1 record and an appearance in the state title game vs. powerhouse Jackson.\n\nStanding in at 6’3 and 200 pounds, he ranks as the nation’s No. 117 overall prospect and No. 12 quarterback, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, an equally weighted average that utilizes all three major recruiting services.\n\nHe also ranks as the No. 4 player from the state of Alabama this cycle.\n\nRivers is undoubtedly one of NC State’s biggest football recruiting wins in program history. His pledge gives head coach Dave Doeren and the Wolfpack four commits early on in the 2027 cycle.\n\nRivers joins Homerville (Ga.) Clinch County three-star safety Kamarion Johnson, Raleigh (N.C.) Cardinal Gibbons three-star tight end Griffin Cockerham and Southeast Raleigh three-star running back Christian Freeman.\n\nLast cycle, NC State signed the nation’s No. 46 class, according to the Rivals Industry Team Recruiting Rankings. It’s early, but the addition of Rivers could provide the Wolfpack with some serious recruiting momentum heading into the spring.\n\nNC State has not signed a top-25 class in the internet recruiting era. It’s highest-ranked haul came in the 2008 cycle, when it landed the No. 26 class that was headlined by four-star QB Mike Glennon.",

    "fullText": "Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao made boxing history in 2015.\n\nMore than a decade later, the two boxing legends are hoping to do it again.\n\nThe two will fight in a professional rematch Sept. 19. The event, which will be streamed live on Netflix, will be the first boxing match to be held at the Las Vegas Sphere.\n\nThe first time around, Mayweather defeated Pacquiao by unanimous decision on May 2, 2015, in the so-called \"Fight of the Century\" at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.\n\n\"I already fought and beat Manny once,\" Mayweather said in a statement released by Netflix. \"This time will be the same result.”\n\nThat fight generated 4.6 million pay-per-view buys and a live gate of $72 million, both of which are still records.\n\nIt was a long-awaited matchup between two of the biggest names in the boxing world — 38-year-old Mayweather (47-0, 26 KO) and 36-year-old Pacquiao (57-5-2, 38 KO) — that ultimately earned Mayweather the World Boxing Council, World Boxing Assn. and World Boxing Organization welterweight titles.\n\nThe backdrop to this year's bout is a bit different. Mayweather is now 50-0 (27 KO) and will be 49 on Tuesday. He has retired and unretired multiple times but has not fought in a bout that counts since his 10-round technical knockout of Conor McGregor in 2017.\n\nAlthough he still has an exhibition fight against Mike Tyson coming up on a still-unannounced date this spring, Mayweather announced last week that he is resuming his professional fighting career.\n\nPacquiao, 47, is 62-9-2 (39 KO). In July, he lost by majority draw to WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios in an attempt to break his own record for oldest welterweight champion. He was 40 when he defeated Keith Thurman for the title in 2019.\n\nPacquiao recently announced a a 10-round welterweight exhibition against former junior welterweight world champion Ruslan Provodnikov on April 18 at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas.\n\n\"Floyd and I gave the world what remains the biggest fight in boxing history,\" Pacquiao said in a statement released by Netflix. \"The fans have waited long enough — they deserve this rematch, and it will be even bigger now that it will be streamed live globally on Netflix. I want Floyd to live with the one loss on his professional record and always remember who gave it to him.\"\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Everton 0-1 Manchester United: Super-sub Sesko scored from the bench for the third time in four games as he finished off a devastating counter-attack",
    "fullText": "When Manchester United were looking for a saviour this season, they opted not to revert to their greatest super-sub. They may not have Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in the dugout but they seem to have his successor in spirit on the pitch. Benjamin Sesko is yet to start a game under Michael Carrick but he has come off the bench to score three times, all significant, delivering an extra five points.\n\nFirst the winner against Fulham, then an equaliser at West Ham, now a decider at Everton. It was early by Sesko’s standards – in the 71st minute, rather than injury time, when Jordan Pickford denied him a second – but it felt further evidence of Carrick’s nous. United had looked blunt before his arrival, lacking inspiration and a focal point in attack. Sesko is the only pure No 9 in the squad and, once again, he illustrated the merits of a penalty-box presence. In time, Carrick may have an issue if he can keep naming Sesko on the bench. For now, their alliance is benefiting both. Carrick said: “I have got a really good relationship with Ben. He has taken some huge steps recently.”\n\nIn a game low on drama, the goal came from a sweeping move. Everton, who had been the more positive in the second half, may regret committing too many men forward, leaving themselves open to the counter-attack which, whether under Carrick or Solskjaer, tends to be United’s most potent weapon.\n\nSesko was involved twice in a move that involved their three big summer signings. He laid the ball off to Matheus Cunha, who sprayed a diagonal pass to release Bryan Mbeumo. He was confronted only by Michael Keane and squared the ball for Sesko, who had run 70 yards to slide in a shot. “It was a ruthless finish,” said Carrick. “I like the way he put it away with real confidence.” It was the Slovenian’s eighth goal for United. He only had two in 17 games when Ruben Amorim was sacked.\n\nAnd United have been transformed since then. They took their haul under Carrick to 16 points from a possible 18, a charge that is putting them on a path towards the Champions League. A distinctly mundane match nevertheless produced a fine result for United.\n\nArguably, they undid some of the damage done on one of Amorim’s most ignominious nights. In November, his United were clueless when confronted with the 10 men of Everton and lost at Old Trafford. The rematch was different and not just because Idrissa Gueye completed the evening without slapping a teammate. Unlike Amorim, Carrick found a way. Successful substitutions have been a theme of his reign, and not just those involving Sesko.\n\nFor one of his predecessors, it was a frustrating reunion. David Moyes has now seen Everton go seven games without a win at Hill Dickinson Stadium. They are yet to record a win over elite opposition at their deluxe ground and, when they were looking more ambitious than United, they conceded.\n\nThey had rarely threatened to in the preceding hour. They almost struck early, when James Tarkowski cleared Amad Diallo’s fourth-minute shot off the line, though Pickford had taken some of the sting out of it. Thereafter, Diogo Dalot thudded a long-range half-volley into the advertising hoardings while, after the break, Mbeumo blazed a shot over from an acute angle.\n\nIf the first half had seemed a contest to give the ball away most, United could savour the earthy qualities that earned them a result. “I'm delighted with the result and spirit, the boys digging deep and sacrificing for each other,” said Carrick. He played his own part. They had too little threat on either flank, so he removed Amad, brought on Sesko and recalibrated his side.\n\nMoyes, of course, did not have a £73m striker in reserve; or in the team, for that matter. “The quality you are talking about costs big money,” he lamented.\n\nThe cheaper striker he does have, Thierno Barry, could have scored inside 10 seconds, albeit without knowing much about it, when Senne Lammens slammed a clearance into him. After that, the Belgian impressed rather more. “Senne was outstanding tonight,” said Carrick. “As a goalkeeper you couldn’t hope for much more: safe hands, calm, composed, an exemplary performance.”\n\nLammens held on to James Garner’s well-struck free kick, saved from Harrison Armstrong less than 30 seconds into the second half and, as Everton chased an equaliser, tipped away Keane’s thunderbolt from distance and thwarted the replacement Tyrique George in injury time. “Their goalie was bloody brilliant,” said Moyes, who nominated Lammens as his man of the match. Everton had directed a series of corners under the bar. They had not realised Lammens would deal with them so well, Moyes reflected ruefully.\n\nWith three summer signings combining for the goal, a fourth excelling in goal, it felt a triumph of United’s recruitment. Of players and, more recently, a head coach.",

    "fullText": "The NFL Competition Committee has discussed a change to the league's rules that would allow replay officials throw penalty flags for fouls that went unpunished on the field.\n\nNFL executive vice president of football operations Troy Vincent said on Monday that the conversation centered on non-football acts that were unpenalized by on-field officials. Vincent cited Seahawks cornerback Josh Jobe striking Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs during Super Bowl LX and Seahawks linebacker Derick Hall stepping on Rams guard Kevin Dotson during the regular season as plays that could be addressed by the change. Jobe was fined for his act and Hall was suspended for one game, but neither was penalized during the game.\n\n\"You don't want to just be expanding the Pandora’s box, but we believe that things like the non-football act, you can really, really restrict what that is,\" Vincent said, via ESPN.com. \"That's something that we believe that potentially there's a little bit of tweaking in the language, that may be the first step.\"\n\nIf the league moves forward with this change, there will likely be more questions in the future about allowing replay officials to make calls on other clear penalties that are missed on the field.",

    "description": "Connelly Early returned this spring sporting an additional 15 pounds of muscle. Monday gave him a chance to try out his new physique on the mound.",
    "fullText": "PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. — Some pitchers go home for the winter with instructions about how to add a new pitch or refine an old one.\n\nThe Red Sox liked what they saw of him in September, and trusted him enough to give him the ball for Game 3 of the Wild Card round in Yankee Stadium.\n\nInstead, the organization advised Early last fall to focus on getting bigger and stronger.\n\nUnlike his closest friend on the team, Payton Tolle, Early doesn’t have the classic power pitcher build. And in order to maximize his stuff and maintain it deeper into outings, the Red Sox wanted him to concentrate on his body.\n\nThere was a revamped diet to start with, and lots of time in the weight room .\n\n“I think we challenged him,” said manager Alex Cora, “and he did (get bigger). I think he added 15 pounds. He’s a lot stronger. That’s going to help him raise the floor on his fastball, maintain the fastball throughout his outings. If he can accomplish that, it’s going to be fun. It was fun last year.”\n\nEarly’s fifth big league start came on the biggest postseason stage imaginable and he showed his poise by not wilting. Early fanned six in 3.2 innings in an elimination game for his team and though he was charged with three earned runs, that was misleading as the team committed several misplays behind him.\n\n“It was a great experience, one that’s going to make him better for his career,” said Cora. “He didn’t care (about the pressure). From the anthem all the way through when he took him out, he was under control.”\n\nEarly’s first major league spring training officially got underway Monday with two scoreless innings against the Tampa Bay Rays at Charlotte Sports Park. He faced seven hitters, and retired six, charged with only a walk.\n\n“I felt good today,” said Early after a 2-1 Red Sox defeat. “Body felt good. I felt comfortable out there. Hopefully, a byproduct of (the added muscle and strength) is the velo ticking up. I think it was in a pretty good spot today, so hopefully, that continues to go up.”\n\nEarly said he didn’t feel much differently on the mound with the added bulk and doesn’t want to obsess about radar gun readings this spring.\n\n“If we’re getting swing-and-misses on (the fastball) and we’re getting some chase,” he said, “it’s a good enough pitch. I’m not too worried about the velo. Honestly, it’s more about holding the floor of the velo at a good spot and feeling good and being able to bounce back from starts.”\n\nThe real test will come later in camp, when Early gets out to five and six innings and discovers whether he’s able to keep the velocity up after 75 or so pitches.\n\nIn the meantime, the Red Sox will want to see Early refine his approach on the mound to pay attention to details: monitoring his tempo, keeping baserunners close and other less obvious facets of the game.\n\n“Polish,” concluded Cora. “He has a good understanding of what he needs to do. His secondary pitches play at this level; they did last year. But there’s more. There’s some progression. He’s not a final product. The physical aspect of it is going to benefit him.”\n\nFenway Insider: Connelly Early makes Grapefruit League debut for Red Sox\n\nRed Sox newcomer given honorable mention on MLB insider’s Top 10 third basemen list\n\nRed Sox reliever wants first baseball card — and to solidify himself as big leaguer in Year 5\n\nAlex Cora’s shout out gave Boston Red Sox trade acquisition ‘more energy’\n\nRed Sox lineup includes players competing for Opening Day roster spots",

    "fullText": "The Buffalo Bills announced that they have re-signed defensive tackle Phidarian Mathis. The former second-round pick agreed to a one year contract. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nStaying in Buffalo ‼️\n\nWe have re-signed OL Alec Anderson and DT Phidarian Mathis each to one year contracts.\n\n— Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) February 23, 2026\n\nMathis, who will turn 28 in April, was chosen 47th overall by the Washington Commanders in the 2022 NFL Draft. He spent three injury-plagued seasons with the club, totaling just 25 tackles and two tackles for loss across only 23 games. Washington released him in December 2024, and he signed with the New York Jets’ practice squad. He did not appear in a game for Gang Green, and he was released in August 2025.\n\nMathis signed with Buffalo’s practice squad on September 10, 2025. The Bills elevated him for two contests—a 23-20 loss to the New England Patriots in Week Five and a 28-21 win over the Kansas City Chiefs in Week Eight—before signing him to their 53-man roster on November 5. Mathis played in four more games during the regular season, and in two of them, he was a huge contributor. He had four tackles in victories over the Cleveland Browns and the New York Jets. Overall, he showed good burst and solid anchor against the run, totaling 13 tackles in his six regular season games.\n\nMathis also played six snaps in the Bills’ Wild Card victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. At 6’4” and 312 lbs. with 34.5” arms, he profiles as someone who can play multiple spots along an odd-man defensive line, which is the scheme the Bills will utilize under new defensive coordinator Jim Leonhard. Coming out of Alabama, NFL Network’s Lance Zierlein called him a “scheme-versatile player” who could play nose tackle in either an odd front or an even front, or a 5-tech defensive end in a 3-4 scheme. Zierlein’s professional comparison for Mathis was DaQuan Jones, Buffalo’s top 1-tech defensive tackle for the last four seasons.\n\nNews had previously leaked regarding Buffalo re-signing offensive lineman Alec Anderson, and the Bills officially announced his signing in the same release announcing the Mathis contract.",

    "title": "Kyle Pitts, George Pickens franchise tag impact: Top remaining free agents",
    "description": "Two of the top offensive players in this year's free agent class may not hit the open market. Here's how that'll impact the rest of free agency.",
    "fullText": "Free agency is weeks away but two major players might not be at the negotiating table.\n\nTight end Kyle Pitts and wide receiver George Pickens are the major prizes of free agency on offense. Teams besides the Atlanta Falcons and Dallas Cowboys, respectively, could be out of luck for negotiating with them.\n\nAtlanta is reportedly using the franchise tag on Pitts and Cowboys co-owner Stephen Jones inferred that was likely for Pickens as well.\n\n“I wouldn’t put any timeframe (on a contract),” Jones told reporters. “Once you have a tag, you have a tag. We know George is going to be here.”\n\nThe franchise tag is a tool teams can use to prevent one player per year from reaching free agency. The tag is a one-year, fully guaranteed contract calculated using other salaries at the position.\n\nIt prevents the player from securing a longer-term deal from another team at the cost of a fully guaranteed salary.\n\nNon-quarterbacks rarely play a season with the franchise tag. Instead, it's often used as a tool to keep the player at the negotiating table for their original team for longer. Jones' quote points to the Cowboys using the franchise tag to keep Pickens in the building to iron out a contract before the start of 2026. If not, he'll play the season on that one-year deal.\n\nHere's what it means for the rest of free agency at their positions if Pickens and Pitts aren't free to negotiate league-wide:\n\nPickens is by far the top wide receiver available in this free-agent class. Second-team All-Pro wide receivers rarely are available - especially ones who haven't hit their second contract yet. That's why the Cowboys are motivated to keep him in-house.\n\nIf Pickens stays with Dallas, that moves all of the other free agents up a spot in the rankings and with it likely a bump in pay.\n\nFellow 2022 draftees Alec Pierce and Rashid Shaheed will become the top free agents at wide receiver. Both offer excellent speed on the outside and Shaheed's a dynamic threat in the return game. Jauan Jennings offers a more possession-based skillset but could get a bump in salary with Pickens off the market as well.\n\nHere's the top 10 free agent wide receivers by projected average annual value (AAV) of their future contracts after Pickens, per Spotrac:\n\nJauan Jennings, San Francisco 49ers: $22.61 million\n\nAlec Pierce, Indianapolis Colts: $20.24 million\n\nWan'dale Robinson, New York Giants: $17.64 million\n\nDeebo Samuel, Washington Commanders: $15.77 million\n\nTyreek Hill, Miami Dolphins: $15.07 million\n\nRashid Shaheed, Seattle Seahawks: $14.12 million\n\nMike Evans, Tampa Bay Buccaneers: $13.31 million\n\nRomeo Doubs, Green Bay Packers: $12.00 million\n\nKeenan Allen, Los Angeles Chargers: $6.81 million\n\nHollywood Brown, Kansas City Chiefs: $5.5 million\n\nPitts has draft pedigree as the No. 4 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, as well as recent production with his second-team All-Pro award in 2025.\n\nLike Pickens, there's a mix of options beyond him at the position, either veterans or second-contract players. Teams will have to decide if they value more youth or production at the position with handing out money in this free-agent cycle. Without Pitts, there's a chance the other players have a chance to make more money but the overall tight end market isn't on the same level as wide receiver. Teams aren't as willing to spend big on the position in the same way.\n\nHere's a look at the top 10 free agents at the position without Pitts, per Spotrac projected AAV:\n\nTravis Kelce, Kansas City Chiefs: $10.77 million\n\nDavid Njoku, Cleveland Browns: $9.99 million\n\nIsaiah Likely, Baltimore Ravens: $8.81 million\n\nChig Okonkwo, Tennessee Titans: $7.96 million\n\nCade Otton, Tampa Bay Buccaneers: $7.91 million\n\nDallas Goedert, Philadelphia Eagles: $6.00 million\n\nTyler Higbee, Los Angeles Rams: $5.35 million\n\nTyler Conklin, Los Angeles Chargers: $3.33 million\n\nNoah Fant, Cincinnati Bengals: $3.22 million\n\nDarren Waller, Miami Dolphins: $3.21 million\n\nAll the NFL news on and off the field.

    "fullText": "Girona earned a point at Mendizorrotza after drawing 2-2 against Deportivo Alavés in an intense match that was decided in the final moments. Míchel's team managed to respond to the initial blow from the Basques but saw the victory slip away in the 89th minute.\n\nThe match started off difficult for the Girona side. In the 5th minute, Boyé put Alavés ahead, taking advantage of a quick action inside the box that caught the visiting defense off guard. The early goal forced Girona to take control of the game and patiently look for their scoring opportunities.\n\nThe response came in the 31st minute. Vanat finished off a set-piece play after a corner to restore balance and reward the growing dominance of the red-and-whites. The goal gave Míchel's team confidence, and they ended the first half with better sensations and control of the ball.\n\nIn the second half, Girona made a decisive step forward. With more presence in the opponent's half and a more vertical passing game, the Catalans found their reward in the 73rd minute. Ounahi, returning to action after the Africa Cup of Nations and his injury, showcased his quality and assisted Tsygankov with a precise pass that the winger coolly converted into a 1-2 lead.\n\nJust as Girona was on the verge of securing three points, a cold shower arrived. In the 89th minute, Boyé scored his second goal, capitalizing on a shot inside the box to make it 2-2. It was an excessive punishment for a Girona side that had managed to come back and created the clearest chances to win the match.\n\nDespite the final disappointment, the point leaves Girona in eleventh place in the standings, with the good news of Ounahi's return, who was instrumental in the second goal. Next Sunday, March 1st, at 9:00 PM, Girona will host Celta de Vigo at Montilivi.",

    "description": "The Braves may not make any starting pitching additions.",
    "fullText": "The Atlanta Braves were linked to a number of starting pitchers this past offseason. They ultimately did not upgrade their rotation, though. After it was recently announced that both Spencer Schwellenbach and Hurston Waldrep are dealing with injuries, rumors began to swirl once again. According to MLB insider Ken Rosenthal, however, the Braves are not interested in two of the top remaining starting pitchers in free agency.\n\nThe Braves, among other teams facing starting pitching injuries, don't seem as intrigued by Lucas Giolito or Zack Littell as you'd expect at the moment, says @Ken_Rosenthal. pic.twitter.com/PELbxh9qT0\n\n— Foul Territory (@FoulTerritoryTV) February 23, 2026\n\nRosenthal pointed to the fact that Bryce Elder and Joey Wentz are both out of options. As a result, they would be placed on waivers if demoted to the minor leagues. Rosenthal reports that the Braves \"evidently\" don't believe signing Lucas Giolito or Zack Littell would be worth the possibility of losing Elder and/or Wentz off waivers.\n\n\"They don't feel Giolito and Littell are enough of an upgrade, I guess, over Wentz and Bryce Elder,\" Rosenthal said.\n\n\"Scherzer is also out there,\" Rosenthal added. \"But Scherzer, it looks like, looks like he might be headed back to Toronto.\"\n\nScherzer landing with the Toronto Blue Jays would make sense, as previous reports have echoed a similar sentiment. However, Giolito and Littell remain available.\n\nLittell spent 2025 with the Tampa Bay Rays and Cincinnati Reds. He ended up making a total of 32 starts, pitching to a 3.81 ERA. He'd be a good depth starter for a number of ball clubs.\n\nGiolito pitched well with the Boston Red Sox a season ago. He recorded a 3.41 ERA across 26 starts.\n\nThe fact that both starters remain un-signed is surprising. One has to imagine they will land a deal sooner rather than later, but it apparently won't be with the Braves unless Atlanta changes its approach.\n\nIt is worth noting that Elder was an All-Star in 2023. He has not been the same pitcher since, as he recorded a 5.30 ERA in 2025. Wentz spent time with the Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates and Minnesota Twins last year, finishing the campaign with a 5.60 ERA across 39 total appearances (13 starts).\n\nElder has displayed signs of potential in the past and Wentz offers versatility given his ability to start or pitch in relief, but not signing Giolito or Littell because Elder and Wentz don't have options would obviously be a questionable move. It would be different if Atlanta was not looking to compete, but the Braves feature an overall talented ball club and would benefit from bringing in at least one more veteran starter amid Schwellenbach and Waldrep's injury concerns.",

    "fullText": "James Harden says he's more than just an NBA player: 'I am a system' originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJames Harden’s most talked-about quote didn’t come after a 50-point night. It came in a press room—and it hasn’t left the conversation since.\n\n“I’m just not a system player; I am a system,” Harden said in 2023.\n\nMORE: Angel Reese serves First Lady teas in fitted Versace\n\nAt the time, the line drew pushback. But in 2026, as detailed in reporting by Brandon “Scoop B” Robinson, the statement reads less like a headline grab and more like a clear explanation of Harden’s role on the floor.\n\nNow with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Harden’s game has shifted from high-volume scoring to full-scale orchestration. Playing alongside Donovan Mitchell, he’s tasked with managing possessions, directing spacing, and creating opportunities before defenses can react.\n\nHarden described what matters most in that role: “Somebody that can have that dialogue with me and understand and move forward and figure out and make adjustments on the fly throughout the course of games, that’s all I really care about. It’s not about me scoring.”\n\nThat approach has defined Cleveland’s structure. With frontcourt options like Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen, Harden’s ability to process the floor in real time has become central to how the offense functions. Instead of operating within a set system, he dictates it—controlling tempo, reading coverages, and forcing defensive shifts.\n\nSpeaking with Robinson, Harden compared that responsibility to elite NFL quarterbacks, pointing to Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, Lamar Jackson, and Patrick Mahomes.\n\n“The greats,” Harden said. “All those guys have decisions to make in every possession… It’s a split second.”\n\nMORE: Devin Booker shades Bad Bunny Halftime performance: 'I'm Mexican'\n\nThe comparison highlights how Harden views the game. Each possession begins with a read—defender positioning, help coverage, timing—and ends with a decision. Whether it’s a pass to a rolling big or a kick-out to a shooter, the outcome is shaped by those initial reads.",

    "description": "Cleveland Browns starting S Ronnie Hickman is a restricted free agent, Kamren Curl could fill is role in free agency",
    "fullText": "The 2026 free agent list for the Cleveland Browns is a sad sight. There are plenty of guys that GM Andrew Berry could have signed to extensions during this past season, but did not. And now, these talented players are headed to the free agency period, which begins March 9.\n\nOne name really stands out: Safety Ronnie Hickman.\n\nIn the Browns’ defensive back room, the following are listed on the free agent list: S Rayshawn Jenkins, CB M.J. Emerson, CB Tre Avery, CB Sam Webb, CB D’Angelo Ross, CB Anthony Kendall, and Hickman. Webb is a restricted free agent, whereas Kendall is an exclusive rights free agent.\n\nHickman is also a restricted free agent. This means a player who has three accrued seasons with an expired contract. He can negotiate with other NFL clubs, subject to “tender offers” from his original team. Cleveland would have the right of first refusal to match any offer sheet.\n\nIf Hickman leaves, or if Berry does not re-sign him before free agency begins, there is trouble in paradise with the safety room. Grant Delpit is the other starter, along with the youngster Donovan McMillon and journeyman Chris Edmonds.\n\nKamren Curl could come in and become the Day 1 starter for the Browns.\n\nThere are plenty of very good safeties in all rounds of the April NFL draft, including Ohio State’s Caleb Downs, who is ranked the #5 prospect in this year’s NFL draft. The Browns are picking at #6, so that is a huge possibility for Cleveland.\n\nHowever, Berry might have his sights on another player and hopes that the draft falls his way. Waiting to see where Downs goes is not prudent. Berry should consider bringing in another safety from free agency first.\n\nBerry is a former college cornerback, so he has always provided the defensive back room with plenty of talent and developmental players. This group is Berry’s pet project.\n\nThis past NFL season, the Browns ranked #4 in the league in defense. Break that down into the #3 passing defense and the #16 rushing defense, so the importance of pass coverage with Cleveland’s defense has been a huge focus.\n\nNFL draft: 2020 Round 7, pick #216 (Commanders)\n\n2025 season: 17 starts, 122 tackles, 2 QB hits, 2 sacks, 2 interceptions, 5 batted passes, 4 pressures, 2 hurries, 0 knockdowns, 2 tackles for loss, 1 forced fumble, 0 fumble recoveries, 0 batted passes, 7 missed tackles, 47 receptions allowed, 1,112 defensive snaps (99%), 46 special teams snaps (10%)\n\n586 career tackles in just six seasons. Had a career high this past season with 122 and had 115 in 2023. Very durable and has missed very few games. 93 games played with 86 NFL starts, so he has the experience. His vertical jump is 34.5.”\n\nHe is a versatile defensive back with underrated coverage abilities and has zero issues coming up and supporting the run-stopping game. He is known across the league as one of the league’s best run-stopping safeties.\n\nBut Curl’s talents don’t just stop with large tackling numbers. He can play free safety, box, lined up at strong safety in college, and play linebacker in the 4-2-5. He is a good blitzer and lends a hand at cornerback if needed.\n\nHe is a reliable tackler with just seven missed tackles this past year. Curl excels at closing on the ball and understands passing lanes. Very good instincts and productive.\n\nCurl does lack elite speed, which is a reason why he doesn’t line up at cornerback. And at times his angle pursuit is off, which results in additional yardage gained. His backpedal is smooth and even.\n\nRuns the alley with adequate effort to free himself from blockers. Reads combinations and comes out clean as deep safety.\n\nHe is good on kickoff teams as well, so he comes with special teams value. He was paid $9 million on a two-year deal with the Rams.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Detroit Lions and Las Vegas Raiders are predicted to pull off a trade involving two players, including edge rusher Max Crosby.\n\nBleacher Report's Alex Ballentine's trade proposal sends Crosby to the Lions and cornerback Terrion Arnold to the Raiders.\n\nThe hypothetical trade would also have Las Vegas acquiring the No. 17 overall pick in April's draft and a 2027 second-round pick:\n\n\"The Lions make a lot of sense as a team that has lost momentum as a contender, though. Dan Campbell's group seemed to fade from the spotlight as the year went on. Pairing Crosby with Aidan Hutchinson puts them right back in that spotlight. It would finally give Crosby a strong bookend while putting the Lions right back in the NFC conversation.\"\n\nAcquiring Crosby would take the Lions' defense to the next level and catapult Dan Campbell's squad to Super Bowl contention.\n\nA pass-rushing duo of Crosby and Aidan Hutchinson would be unstoppable and would cover up other weaknesses Detroit may have on defense.\n\nTrading for Crosby will cost the Lions premium draft capital and a player, and Arnold could be the player Las Vegas wants. The young corner played just eight games in 2025 due to a shoulder injury, but when healthy, he's a solid starter who will only get better.\n\nHowever, giving up Arnold to land a game-changer like Crosby is a no-brainer for the Lions. Crosby is one of the best players in football, tallying three double-digit sack seasons in the past four years.\n\nDespite all the trade speculation, Crosby will likely remain in Las Vegas this season, but if he does request a trade and gets moved by the Raiders, the Lions should be a top landing spot, especially if Detroit fails to re-sign breakout edge rusher Al-Quadin Muhammad in free agency.\n\nRams $44 million cut candidate could land with Bills, Patriots, Steelers\n\nKyle Pitts rumor is bad news for Giants, Commanders, Eagles, Broncos\n\nFalcons rumor could lead to trade with Steelers, Dolphins or Jets\n\nMaxx Crosby rumor gives Bills, Cowboys, Eagles, Pats minimum trade price\n\nRumor from NFL Network reveals Browns' interest in top free agent",

    "title": "What releasing Antonio Gibson means for the Patriots",
    "description": "The veteran running back was let go ahead of NFL free agency.",
    "fullText": "The New England Patriots decided to shake up their running back room on Monday. Antonio Gibson, who originally joined the team on a three-year, $11.25 million free agency deal in 2024, was released after two seasons and 22 total games with the organization.\n\nThe move itself did not come as too big a surprise. Not only was Gibson little more than a rotational option in the Patriots’ backfield with an unclear outlook given that Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson reside atop the depth chart, he also is currently rehabbing a torn ACL suffered in October.\n\nThat said, let’s take a bigger-picture view at what the transaction means from a New England perspective.\n\nThe Patriots entered the offseason with six true running backs under contract for the 2026 season, including Gibson as the projected RB3 behind the aforementioned Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson. With him no longer a piece of the puzzle, one layer of depth has been removed behind the top pair and is leaving the group looking as follows:\n\nRunning back (5): Rhamondre Stevenson (38), TreVeyon Henderson (32), Terrell Jennings (26), Lan Larison (34), Elijah Mitchell (45)\n\nOutside of those six players, the Patriots also have two backfield players headed for free agency. Both running back Deneric Prince and fullback Jack Westover are exclusive rights free agents.\n\nEven if Prince and Westover are retained, the Patriots are lacking established depth or long-term developmental upside behind Stevenson and Henderson. While they project as a formidable one-two punch, no Gibson as the third option means that the team might be on the lookout for another player with a similarly versatile skillset.\n\nBefore tearing his ACL in Week 5 against the Buffalo Bills, Gibson had not just served as the Patriots’ third running back but also their top kickoff return man. As such, he had averaged 28.5 yards on his 12 runbacks and also scored a 90-yard touchdown in Week 2 versus Miami.\n\nOnce Gibson was lost for the year, the Patriots were unable to find similar production and home-run potential. Six other players returned kickoffs for them on the year — running backs Rhamondre Stevenson, TreVeyon Henderson, Terrell Jennings and D’Ernest Johnson as well as wide receivers Kyle Williams and Efton Chism III — but none emerged as a clear featured option.\n\nWith Gibson now officially out of the picture, the competition will start at zero again. Based on flashes, Henderson and Williams seem like the frontrunners at the moment, but there are a lot of factors plus future roster changes that are likely to change that projection.\n\nOne of the reasons why Gibson getting released was no surprise was his contract. Carrying a $4.14 million salary cap number, he was the 21st most-expensive player on the team right now. That in itself might not have been a release-worthy problem, but the structure of the pact invited a change: only his $1 million signing bonus proration for the 2026 season was fully-guaranteed.\n\nThat $1 million will now be added to the Patriots’ dead cap space for 2026. Meanwhile, the team created $2.14 million in net savings: his gross savings of $3.14 million minus another player with a $1 million salary cap number taking his spot on the Top 51 list of contracts to be counted against the cap once the new league year starts in mid-March.\n\nAccording to salary cap expert Miguel Benzan, Gibson’s release now puts the Patriots $44.3 million under a projected league cap of $304.3 million.\n\nConsidering that Gibson was released with a failed physical designation, however, it appears that he qualifies for the NFL’s injury protection benefit. If so and he remains unsigned heading into the new season, the Patriots might be charged $2.1 million against their cap at the start of the regular season. In that case, the financial gains of releasing the 27-year-old would be minimal.\n\nThe Patriots’ 2024 offseason was their first without Bill Belichick presiding over their football operations. So, who was the first free agent added under the new regime led by Eliot Wolf and then-head coach Jerod Mayo? That would be one Mr. Antonio Gibson.\n\nWith Gibson now gone, so is another remnant of the Mayo-era Patriots. In fact, less than 14 months after his firing, only 23 players remain with the team who played under the one-and-done coach as pointed out by Ethan. Hurwitz of Sports Illustrated.\n\nWith Antonio Gibson's release, here's the list of remaining Patriots under contract for 2026 that played under Jerod Mayo:\n\n– Christian Gonzalez\n– DeMario Douglas\n– Kayshon Boutte\n– Drake Maye\n– Marte Mapu\n– Bryce Baringer\n– Dell Pettus\n– Marcus Jones\n– Terrell Jennings\n-…\n\n— Ethan Hurwitz (@HurwitzSports) February 23, 2026\n\nWhile his failed physical might have forced their hand a bit, the Patriots had no real reason to release Gibson now as opposed to closer to the start of free agency on March 11. However, with the entire league embarking on Indianapolis this week for the NFL Scouting Combine, getting cut now allows Gibson a head start of sorts.\n\nSure, teams will be cautious when it comes to a running back who tore his ACL just four months ago, but Gibson’s name is at least out there already and he can start taking visits and undergoing physical examination with other clubs right away. Other veteran running backs who might end up competing against him on the open market might not be in that same position yet.",

    "description": "Benjamin Sesko scores winner for Manchester United at Everton in Premier League.",
    "fullText": "Everton 0 - 1 Manchester United FT\n\nBenjamin Sesko was Manchester United's super-sub for the second match running as the Slovenian scored the only goal against Everton to send Michael Carrick's men clear in fourth spot.\n\nThirteen days after Sesko struck deep in injury time to rescue a point at West Ham, the £73.7m forward applied a clinical first-time finish to a 71st-minute counter-attack that he had started deep in his own half.\n\nSesko kept motoring after laying a pass off to Matheus Cunha. By the time Cunha had delivered a long pass to Bryan Mbeumo, the eager Sesko had outrun Everton's defence and was on hand to stroke home his eighth goal of the season.\n\nRemarkably, only two of those goals came under former boss Ruben Amorim, with three coming in Darren Fletcher's two-game stint in interim charge and three under Carrick, who has now won five of his six games at the helm.\n\nIt was a moment of class that was a long time in coming in a match that was low on quality at Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\nBoth sides struggled against obdurate defences, having gone almost a fortnight without a game after playing early in the last round of matches, late in this one and with no FA Cup game in between after respective early exits.\n\nIn a game of few chances, James Tarkowski cleared off the line in the first half after an effort from Amad was half-saved by Jordan Pickford.\n\nVisiting goalkeeper Senne Lammens denied teenager Harrison Armstrong, who had Everton's best attempt before Michael Keane let fly with a thunderous long-range effort eight minutes from time. The shot was heading towards the top left corner but Lammens was again alert, with the Belgium international tipping the ball over.\n\nThis result means it is now seven home games without a win in all competitions for Everton, who sit ninth.\n\nWhat did you make of Everton’s display?\n\nHave your say on Manchester United's performance\n\nIn six games at the helm, Carrick has made two changes to his starting line-up, both due to injury.\n\nLisandro Martinez missed this one because of a minor calf problem, which meant Leny Yoro had to step in at the back.\n\nHe is backing his players, and he knows there is firepower on the bench too.\n\nWhen United performed as poorly as they had done at West Ham, some critics were already taking to social media to claim the bubble had burst.\n\nHowever, Carrick has trust in Sesko. With less than an hour gone and with little sign of a goal coming, Carrick sent on his towering forward.\n\nHis finish was not as eye-catching as the one at London Stadium, but he held his nerve when it mattered.\n\nSesko should have had a second after he was sent clear by Diogo Dalot as the game entered stoppage time.\n\nIf he had taken it, it would have spared United a few anxious minutes. As it was, he failed to control the ball properly, and England goalkeeper Pickford was able to see off the danger.\n\nSesko's goals in his latest two games could prove priceless as United strive for one of what seem certain to be five Champions League places for English teams.\n\nNot only have United put three points between themselves and Chelsea and Liverpool, who sit fifth and sixth, but they are now only three points behind third-placed Aston Villa, who they entertain at Old Trafford in three games' time.\n\nDavid Moyes wore a look of irritation and frustration as he went to shake hands at the final whistle.\n\nThe Scot knew that for much of the contest his home side had been the equal of the club he once managed.\n\nBut, as has been the case often for Everton, big-spending opponents delivered a moment of quality for which the Toffees had no response.\n\nMoyes has promise in his squad. That was clear when looking at Armstrong, former United midfielder James Garner, who excelled at right-back, and Tyrique George, who was denied by Lammens deep in stoppage time as Everton desperately chased an equaliser.\n\nTarkowski, Pickford and Keane are reliable and experienced. But the elite level depth is not there.\n\nMoyes spoke in his programme notes about chasing targets beyond the ones Everton have recently been used to going after. In recent seasons, their mission has essentially been to deal with a chronic financial situation and stay up.\n\nA new stadium means new ambitions, and there has been no relegation danger this season. But Everton want more than mid-table security.\n\nThe only problem with that is – as Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace are finding out – without sufficient resources, juggling Premier League and European football is a fresh strain on resources than can be exceptionally tough to overcome.\n\nMoyes will keep pushing for those loftier spots in the table because it is his nature, but perhaps the top half and no more would not be a bad outcome for the first campaign away from Goodison Park.\n\nEverton are next in action in the Premier League at Newcastle United on Saturday, 28 February (15:00 GMT). Manchester United entertain Crystal Palace on Sunday, 1 March (14:00 GMT).",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFor many seasons, the Los Angeles Angels moved as Mike Trout did. He was the sole face of the club's offense after Shohei Ohtani signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers, and he has had a difficult time staying healthy.\n\nTrout missed a month of the season in 2025 after suffering a bone bruise in his left knee, the same knee he had surgery on in 2024. After coming back, he was reduced to being used as the primary DH for the club.\n\nAnd while Trout was trying his best to give the Angels all he had, someone else stepped up to be the face of the offense, and that would be outfielder Jo Adell.\n\nMORE: Angels players 'took notice' of owner Arte Moreno's recent comments\n\nMike Trout could only muster up 26 home runs last year, tying him for third place alongside Zach Neto. Taylor Ward would go on to have a great season, hitting 36 home runs, but it was not enough to be the home run leader for the Halos.\n\nThat prize would go to Adell, who hit a career-high 37 home runs last season over the course of 152 games.\n\nWhile he may take a step back this year, Bleacher Report's Joel Reuter believes he can be the home run leader for the Angels once again in 2026.\n\n\"Despite his poor batting average and middling defense, the Angels gave Jo Adell a full runway to prove himself last season. The 26-year-old responded by finishing in fourth on the AL leaderboard with a career-high 37 home runs, and while a potential Mike Trout resurgence looms, Adell now stands as a top-tier power threat.\"\n\nNow, if the Angels can get a healthy and resurging year from Trout, they could be in a much better position than they have been over the last few years.\n\nThe Pirates' home run crown could come down to three new faces\n\nEugenio Suarez returns to Cincinnati to reclaim his home run throne\n\nAnticipating a crowded leaderboard for the Athletics' home run crown\n\nMLB analyst makes the case for Kerry Carpenter to carry Detroit offensively\n\nNew walls and goals for Royals' star Bobby Witt Jr. in Kansas City",

    "fullText": "Thanks to Henri Veesaar's return on Saturday, the UNC basketball team is back in the win column. North Carolina roared ahead midway through the second half on Saturday, downing Syracuse 77-64 and sweeping the season series.\n\nEarlier last week, the Tar Heels lost an embarrassing, 82-58 rivalry battle with NC State. UNC looked overwhelmed from opening tip, with the host Wolfpack (19-8, 10-4 ACC) playing off a rowdy crowd.\n\nNorth Carolina is still in the rankings ahead of Monday night's home clash with Louisville – and a win should further improve its standing. In college basketball analyst Andy Katz' latest Power 37 rankings, the Tar Heels dropped to 29th.\n\nUNC sits between Iowa (28th) and Georgia (30). The Hawkeyes split a pair of ranked games last week, upsetting Nebraska and losing at Wisconsin, while the Bulldogs upset Kentucky and Texas.\n\nNorth Carolina is still awaiting Caleb Wilson's return, but his teammates are stepping up, including unlikely heroes like Zayden High. The Tar Heels' backcourt is still trying to find consistency, but senior captain Seth Trimble is a key behind big games.\n\nNEW #Power37 from @TheAndyKatz 🚨\n\n1. Duke\n2. Arizona\n3. Michigan\n4.

Iowa State\n\n— NCAA March Madness (@MarchMadnessMBB) February 23, 2026\n\nUNC faces a brutal schedule to end regular season play, starting with the ranked Cardinals (20-7, 9-5 ACC) on Monday night. North Carolina hosts Virginia Tech on Saturday night at 8:30 p.m., Clemson next Tuesday at 7 p.m., then a rematch at Duke on March 7.\n\nThe Tar Heels currently sit in a sixth-place tie with Louisville in the ACC, meaning they'd have a single bye in the ACC Tournament. UNC has an outside chance to clinch the ACC regular season title, but needs the conference-leading Blue Devils (25-2, 13-1 ACC) and others to, essentially, lose out.\n\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: UNC basketball falls to 29th in latest Power 37 rankings",

With 24 games remaining, some might question Murray returning. But tanking doesn't serve much purpose for the Pelicans after trading this year's first-round selection to the Hawks to move up to select Derik Queen.\n\n\"I'm not one of those guys like I'm paid, I could get an extra 6-7 months, or our team is 14th in the West. There are a lot of excuses for a chump to say 'I'm not playing'. I am the opposite of that... I want to represent of New Orleans\"\n\n-- Dejounte Murray on New Orleans pic.twitter.com/NOB1LzV3IC\n\n— Pelicans Film Room (@PelsFilmRoom) February 23, 2026\n\n[Get more Pelicans news: New Orleans team feed]\n\nMurray also wants to see some game action after being sidelined for more than a year.\n\n\"I'm here, I love New Orleans, I love the people. This is the reason I'm coming back,\" Murray said to Pelicans Film Room on Monday.\n\n\"I'm not one of those guys like, I'm paid, I could get an extra 6-7 months, or our team is 14th in the West,'\" he added. \"There are a lot of excuses for a chump to say, 'No, I ain't playing.' I am the opposite of that.\"\n\nMurray will likely be on a minutes restriction as he works his way back. Pelicans interim head coach James Borrego didn't say for certain how much Murray might play, but praised him for wanting to get on the court.\n\n\"It speaks to his character, that he cares,\" Borrego said, via the Associated Press. \"I'm not saying that everybody coming off this injury would even play right now. This kid wants to play. He wants to be out there on the floor. He wants to compete. He wants to be out there with his teammates. He wants to win.\"\n\nDuring his eight NBA seasons, Murray has averaged 15.5 points, 5.8 rebounds, 5.4 assists and 1.5 steals per game playing for the San Antonio Spurs, Hawks and Pelicans. He missed the entire 2018-19 season with a torn ACL sustained during the preseason.",

    "fullText": "Kouri Richins, a Utah mom of three and children's book author accused of killing her husband last year, allegedly Googled \"luxury prisons for the rich\" after his death, according to new court documents.\n\nProsecutors say Richins, 33, poisoned her husband, 39-year-old Eric Richins, with fentanyl the evening of March 3, 2022, at their home in Kamas, just outside of Park City, while their three young sons were sleeping.\n\nShe also told police after her husband was found dead that \"he didn't just die in his sleep,\" records reveal.\n\nRichins appeared in court on Monday, when she was denied bail.\n\nUTAH CHILDREN'S BOOK AUTHOR ACCUSED OF MURDERING HUSBAND TOOK OUT $2M IN LIFE INSURANCE PRIOR TO HIS DEATH\n\nNew details of the case were revealed in court records, though, which show that investigators got access to Richins' phone and found various typo-ridden Google searches that they believe may be used as incriminating evidence against the suspect, though her defense team disagrees.\n\nShe apparently searched the following phrases beginning in April 2022: \"luxury prisons for the rich in america,\" \"how long does life insrance companies takento.pay [sic];\" \"can you delete everythjng on an old icloud account [sic],\" \"can deleted text messages be retrieved,\" \"what information can be cbtained from a cellphone [sic],\" \"how to turn find my iphone off [sic],\" \"can cops force you to do a lie detector test,\" \"when does FBI get involved in a case,\" \"what is considered a lethal.dose of fentanyl [sic],\" and \"what are you allowed inside utah jails.\"\n\nUTAH AUTHOR ACCUSED OF MURDEIRNG HUSBAND ALLEGEDLY CAUGHT TRYING TO STEAL HIS LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS\n\nRichins' Google Search history also included a search for her own net worth, various inquiries about ranches for sale in Tennessee and Montana and searches for her husband's family's ties to police in Summit County, Utah.\n\nThe suspect's defense attorney, Skye Lazaro, filed a response to the state's allegations on Sunday, saying her \"search history is merely in response to what was happening with the investigation, not evidence as of guilt as the State asserts.\"\n\nLazaro also pushed for Richins' release on bail \"because there is no substantial evidence to support the charges,\" though a judge on Monday denied bail for the murder suspect.\n\nAmy Richins, Eric’s sister, called her sister-in-law \"desperate, greedy and extremely manipulative\" in a statement read aloud during Richins' Monday bail hearing.\n\n\"How can anyone value human life so cheaply? I cannot comprehend it,\" she said.\n\nUTAH CHILDREN'S BOOK AUTHOR HAD ‘PERFECT’ MARRAIGE WITH HUSBAND BEFORE ALLEGED MURDER: FRIEND\n\nProsecutors allege Richins purchased four different life insurance policies on Eric Richins' life totaling more than $1.9 million between 2015 and 2017. On Jan. 1, 2022, months before his murder, Kouri \"surreptitiously and without authorization changed the beneficiary for Eric's $2 million life insurance policy to herself,\" the document states.\n\nPrior to his death, Eric took Kouri off his will and made his sister the beneficiary instead, according to investigators. His family told authorities he had been in fear for his life after Kouri allegedly tried to poison him once several years ago in Greece and again on Valentine's Day 2022.\n\nUTAH MAN ALLEGEDLY POISONED BY AUTHOR WIFE BELIEVED SHE WAS HAVING AFFAIR: FAMILY SPOX\n\nThe couple was apparently having financial disagreements due to Kouri's wish to purchase a $2 million mansion under construction in Wasatch County. She wanted to flip the mansion and sell it for a profit, a warrant states.\n\nEric apparently thought the home was too expensive, his family told investigators.\n\nUTAH CHILDREN'S BOOK AUTHOR, HUSBAND SPARRED OVER ‘CURSED’ MANSION BEFORE HIS ALLEGED MURDER\n\nKouri, who owns a real estate company, is accused of poisoning Eric with a Moscow Mule spiked with fentanyl, an opioid that is lethal in small doses, while they were celebrating a home sale March 3, 2022. The next day, Kouri allegedly closed a deal on the Wasatch County mansion \"alone,\" after her husband was pronounced dead.\n\nKouri told investigators the morning of March 4, 2022, that she did not know what happened to her husband after calling police to report his death, according to a transcript from police-worn body camera footage taken at the scene of Eric's murder.\n\n\"He didn't just die in his sleep. This is insane,\" she told police at the time.\n\nLater on, after finding out that her children heard their father had died, Kouri Richins apparently said, \"Oh, my God. This can't be happening. This can't be happening. This can't be happening.\"\n\nKouri's defense attorney alleges that Summit County officials did not read Richins her Miranda rights while they questioned her after Eric Richins' death and apparently ignored communication from her counsel. She is arguing that as a result of alleged malpractice, investigators should \"refrain from using the passcode to access Ms. Richins’ cell phone,\" the filing states.\n\nAdditionally, Kouri's defense team is taking issue with testimony from a witness identified as C.L. in court documents, who is currently in prison. C.L. told investigators that she sold fentanyl to Kouri prior to Eric's poisoning death, but Lazaro alleges that C.K. only identified the fentanyl after investigators pushed her to do so after questioning her for over an hour.\n\nAfter Eric's death, Kouri wrote a children's book about death, \"Are You With Me?\"\n\nA description for the book, which was listed on Amazon for $14.99, describes \"Are You With Me?\" as \"a must-read for any child who has experienced the pain of loss, and for parents who want to provide their children with the emotional support they need to heal and grow.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

    "description": "We release Steerling-8B, an 8B-parameter causal diffusion language model that is interpretable by construction — its predictions are routed through concepts you can measure, audit, and control.",
    "fullText": "We are releasing Steerling-8B, the first interpretable model that can trace any token it generates to its input context, concepts a human can understand, and its training data.\nTrained on 1.35 trillion tokens, the model achieves downstream performance within range of models trained on 2–7× more data.\nSteerling-8B unlocks several capabilities which include suppressing or amplifying specific concepts at inference time without retraining, training data provenance for any generated chunk, and inference-time alignment via concept control, replacing thousands of safety training examples with explicit concept-level steering.\n\nFor the first time, a language model, at the 8-billion-parameter scale, can explain every token it produces in three key ways.\nMore specifically, for any group of output tokens that Steerling generates, we can trace these tokens to:\n\nWe are releasing the weights of a base model trained on 1.35T tokens as well as companion code to interact and play with the model.\n\nBelow we show Steerling-8B generating text from a prompt across various categories. You can select an example, then click on any highlighted chunk of the output. The panel below will update to show:\n\nSteerling is built on a causal discrete diffusion model backbone, which lets us steer generation across multi-token tokens rather than only at the next-token.\nThe key design choice is decomposing the model’s embeddings into three explicit pathways: ~33K supervised “known” concepts, ~100K “discovered” concepts the model learns on its own, and a residual that captures whatever remains.\n\nWe then constrain the model with training loss functions that ensure the model routes signal through concepts without a fundamental tradeoff with performance.\nThe concepts feed into logits through a linear path, every prediction decomposes exactly into per-concept contributions, and we can edit those contributions at inference time without retraining.\nFor the full architecture, training objectives, and scaling analysis, see Scaling Interpretable Models to 8B.\n\nDespite being trained on significantly fewer compute than comparable models, Steerling-8B achieves competitive performance across standard benchmarks. The figure below shows average performance (across 7 benchmarks) versus approximate training FLOPs on a log scale, with vertical lines marking multiples of Steerling’s compute budget.\n\nIn the previous update, we shared several ways that assess how interpretable a model’s representations are.\nHere we provide another metric that gives insight into the model’s use of its concepts. On a held-out validation set, over 84% of token-level contribution comes from the concept module: the model is not just using the residual to make its predictions.\nThis matters for control: if the model’s predictions genuinely flow through concepts, then editing those concepts at inference time actually changes what the model does rather than nudging a side channel while the real work happens elsewhere.\n\nA useful check is what happens when we remove the residual pathway. On several LM Harness tasks, dropping the residual has only a small effect, which suggests the model’s predictive signal is largely routed through concepts rather than hidden “everything-else” channels.\n\nFinally, Steerling can detect known concepts in text with 96.2% AUC on a held-out validation dataset.\n\nIn the coming weeks, we’ll be releasing deep dives on each of these capabilities:\n\nWe’ll cover each of these in detail in upcoming posts, with quantitative evaluations and deployment-oriented case studies.",

    "fullText": "Life is complicated. Regardless of what your beliefs or politics or ethics are, the way that we set up our society and economy will often force you to act against them: You might not want to fly somewhere but your employer will not accept another mode of transportation, you want to eat vegan but are at some point in a situation where the best you can do is a vegetarian option.\n\nSometimes it’s not even our hand being forced but us not having the mental strength or priorities to do something: I could just not use WhatsApp because it is owned by Meta but my son’s daycare organizes everything through WhatsApp and do I really want to force my belief on all those very busy parents and caretakers or should I just bite the bullet and use the tool that seems to work for everyone – even though it’s not perfect?\n\nThere are no one-size-fits-all solutions for this: Sometimes a belief or ethic you hold is so integral to you that you will not move. Sometimes they are held loosely enough to let go under certain conditions. There’s a multitude of factors and thoughts that go into those kinds of decisions and at some point you just gotta make a call based on what’s in front of you and your priorities.\n\nWhat I am saying is: We are all doing things we know are not ideal, are either morally questionable or do not align with our values. That’s life. I for example know that consuming meat is problematic for ethical and ecological reasons, I still do it sometimes. I reduce as much as I can but I am far from perfect. Just one of the many examples of my actions not being perfectly and purely aligned with my beliefs.\n\nAnd I am 100% sure each and every reader will have similar experiences. We are imperfect and messy beings. In the end all you can do is actually try to make good decisions based on your values, try to learn from your actions and ideally do better – or at least understand what were the forces that go you to act against your values.\n\nCory Doctorow, probably one of the most influential writers about digital technology and culture celebrated the 6th anniversary of his personal blog pluralistic – congratulations! Cory is quite the phenomenon, I know nobody with his amount of output and his consistency of publication. It is scary just how consistently he writes and published while also churning out books. I do admire his work ethic tremendously.\n\nBut one thing in his celebratory post rubbed me the wrong way and I think it’s worth pointing out. Not for the one specific case but because it highlights a problematic way of thinking that I see a lot in current tech discourse that stands in the way of us actually improving the world.\n\nSo Cory outlines his process of how he publishes to his blog (and then pushes the same writing out to other places). He describes how one QA step in his process is piping his writing through an LLM (using the Ollama software, it’s unclear which open weight LLM he uses) to check for typos and small grammar mistakes. He then points out how some readers might find that problematic:\n\n“Doubtless some of you are affronted by my modest use of an LLM. You think that LLMs are “fruits of the poisoned tree” and must be eschewed because they are saturated with the sin of their origins. I think this is a very bad take, the kind of rathole that purity culture always ends up in.”\n\nUsing LLMs isn’t always popular with the cool crowd, Cory knows that. And he wants to defend his (quite modest) use, which I understand: Nobody likes their problematic behavior being pointed out to them. But as outlined: Life’s complicated. Cory could just have said “I know there are many critiques of LLMs, but right now that is the best way for me to enable my work, I try to limit the problematic aspects by using a small open weight model and checking the results in detail.” and have moved on. But he needed to make a stand. And that stand lead him into the problematic train of thought that I wanted to point out here. Because many, many people listen to him and basically take his word as the gospel. So great power, great responsibility and such.\n\nThe whole argument is based on a strawman. Let’s look at Cory’s words:\n\nLet’s start with some context. If you don’t want to use technology that was created under immoral circumstances or that sprang from an immoral mind, then you are totally fucked. I mean, all the way down to the silicon chips in your device, which can never be fully disentangled from the odious, paranoid racist William Shockley, who won the Nobel Prize for co-inventing the silicon transistor\n\nCory is right in pointing out that almost any technology we have has been touch by problematic figures. Racists, fascists, sexists, rapists. You name it. Anything you touch will have some research or engineering or product work by a person you despise in it.\n\nThe strawman is his claim that people who criticize LLM usage are doing that for some form of absolutist reasons. That they have a fully binary view of the world as separated into “acceptable, pure things” and “garbage”. Which is of course false. Because they are using a computer, using warm water that’s probably heated through the use of fossil fuels etc.\n\nHe attacks a ridiculous made-up figure to deflect from specific criticism of LLM use (that many probably wouldn’t even apply that strongly to his use case). But that’s not where criticism of LLMs comes from: It’s mostly specific focusing on the material properties of these systems, their production and use.\n\n“Refusing to use a technology because the people who developed it were indefensible creeps is a self-owning dead-end. You know what’s better than refusing to use a technology because you hate its creators? Seizing that technology and making it your own. Don’t like the fact that a convicted monopolist has a death-grip on networking? Steal its protocol, release a free software version of it, and leave it in your dust:”\n\nHere again Cory is misrepresenting the LLM-critic’s argument: Sam Altman is a scam artist and habitual liar, but that’s not one of the first 10 to 20 reasons people criticise OpenAI’s products. Sure, basically every leading figure in the “AI” space seems to be unpleasant at best but that’s true for most of tech TBH. People criticise LLMs for their structural properties, their material impacts, for the way they make it harder to learn and grow, for the way they make products worse while creating massive negative externalities in the form of emissions, water use and e-waste. For the way these systems can only be build by taking every piece of data – regardless of whether the authors consent or even explicitly refuse – and how the training needs ungodly amounts of harmful, exploitative labor done mostly by people in countries from the global majority. How it materially harms the commons.\n\nEven if OpenAI was run by decent, ethical, friendly, trustworthy people (which would then of course make them not work on the products OpenAI has, but it’s just a thought experiment) their products would need to be criticized for what they are and what they do. It’s really not about these few dudes running the companies.\n\nCory misrepresents the arguments (well basically hides them) in order to not have to face any material criticism and turns them into “you just don’t like these people” which frames the criticism as emotional and not rational. As if it was about not liking a bunch of rich men.\n\nHe then goes into how the path forward is to “steal the protocol”. His following paragraph goes into detail:\n\n“That’s how we make good tech: not by insisting that all its inputs be free from sin, but by purging that wickedness by liberating the technology from its monstrous forebears and making free and open versions of it”\n\nAnd here we are coming to the core of the problematic argument. Because Cory implicitly argues that technology is neutral and that one can just change its meaning and effect through usage. But as Langdon Winner argues in his famous essay “Do artifacts have politics” artifacts have built-in politics deriving from their structure. A famous example is the nuclear power plant: Due to the danger of these plants, their needs with regards to resources as well as security, power plants imply a certain form of political arrangement based on having a strong security force/army and a way to force these facilities (and facilities to store the waste in) upon communities potentially against their will.\n\nArtifacts and technologies have certain logics built into their structure that do require certain arrangements around them or that bring forward certain arrangements. The second aspect is often illustrated by how ships are organized: Because ships are sometimes in dangerous situations and sometimes critical decisions need to be made, the existence of ships implies the existence of a hierarchy of power relationships with a captain having the final say. Because democracy would be too slow at times. These politics are built into the artifact.\n\nUnderstanding this you cannot take any technology and “make it good”. Is a torturing device “good” if the plans on how to build it are creative commons? Do we need to answer the existence of the digital torment nexus by building an open source torment nexus? I’d argue we need to destroy it – regardless of what license it is released under.\n\nThat does not mean that it is impossible to take certain technologies or artifacts and try to reframe them, change their meaning. In some way computers are one such example: They were first used by governments, banks and other corporations to reach their goals but where then taken and reframed as devices intended to support personal liberation. It’s a bit more complicated (for why, dive into the late David Golumbia’s “The Cultural Logic of Computation”) but let’s give that one to Cory. Sure, sometimes it is possible to take something originally built for nefarious purposes and find better uses for it. But is that true for everything? Very obviously not.\n\nLet’s just look at the embedded politics of LLMs: In order to train a capable system you need data. Lots of it. AI companies keep buying books to scan them, they download everything from every legal or illegal source claiming “fair use” (a doctrine that only applies to the US by the way) or that “scraping is always okay”. Capable LLMs require a logic of dominance and of disregarding consent of the people producing the artifacts that are the raw material for the system. LLMs are based on extraction, exploitation and subjugation: To produce these systems – even if you release the end result as open weights for people to use at home – you need to take cultural works, personal writing etc. from people who not only not consented but actively reject that notion. The politics of LLMs is violence. How does one “liberate” that? What’s the case for open source violence?\n\nHe uses a so-called “open source LLM” and that’s very much how he presents his values but open-source LLMs do not really exist. You can download some weights but cannot understand what went into them or really change or reproduce them. Open source AI is just marketing and openwashing.\n\nCory shows his libertarian leanings here: If everything is somehow “free and open” then we have won. But “free and open” in this context usually means that “certain privileged groups have easy access to it and are not limited in what to do with it”. That’s one of the core problems with the whole “open Source” movement: That it reduces all struggle to if one can get their hands on the tools and has any restrictions to using them.\n\nThis also shines through in Cory arguing that we need to “liberate” technology. What a strange idea: Technology doesn’t need liberation, people do. Technologies are tools, not what we actually care about. Sure, sometimes technologies can play a role in liberating people but just as often “freeing” a technology does quite the opposite to people: Ask the women who have massive amounts of nonconsensually created sexualized images and videos generated of them whether they think that the “liberation” of stochastic images generators is liberating them? Technology doesn’t need to be free. It cannot be free because freedom as a concept applies to people.\n\nAnd freedom is not the only value that we care about. Making everything “free” sounds cool but who pays for that freedom? Who pays for us having for example access to the freedom an open weight LLM brings? Our freedom as users rests on the exploitation of and violence against the people suffering the data centers, labeling the data for the training, the folks gathering the resources for NVIDIA to build chips. Freedom is not a zero-sum game but a lot of the freedoms that wealthy people in the right (which I am one of) enjoy stem from other people’s lack thereof.\n\n“Purity culture is such an obvious trap, an artifact of the neoliberal ideology that insists that the solution to all our problems is to shop very carefully, thus reducing all politics to personal consumption choices:”\n\nCory labels people’s values and their prioritization as “purity culture” (referring back to the black and white strawman the started this part of his post with) and then pulls a really interesting spin here: Many people criticizing LLMs come from a somewhat leftist (in contrast to Cory’s libertarian) background. Cory intentionally frames those leftist thoughts that put politics based on values as “neoliberal ideology” that reduces “all politics to personal consumption choices”. This is clever narratively: Tell those stupid leftists that they are just neoliberals, the thing they hate! Awesome.\n\nBut the argument against using LLMs is not about shopping and markets at all. My not using LLMs does not influence anything in that regard, Microsoft will just keep making the data center go BRRRRRRR.\n\nIn a way this framing shows more about Cory’s thinking than about that of the people he criticises: Cory is focused on markets and market dynamics and in that world it’s about purchasing. But moral choices only sometimes relate to markets. They do when I for example choose only to buy fairly produced garments. But when I for example refused conscription (when I was young Germany still forced every young man to learn how to kill) that was not a shopping decision. That was politics as well as leading an ethical life.\n\nPeople do not believe that “not using LLMs” will solve the issue of OpenAI etc all existing. They do no want to build on, use products with so clearly defined harms and negative externalities. Because they believe it to be wrong. Sure, there might be a utilitarian argument for “the thing exists anyways and if it saves you time, that’s good, right” but many people are not utilitarians. They want to lead a life where they feel their actions align with their values. In a way that is a path to freedom: To having the freedom to make the decisions one feels are right are in alignment with one’s values.\n\nWhich Cory actually also believe and acts upon when it’s about his values: He has refused to create a Bluesky account in spite of wanting to be there cause his friends are there for (good!) ideological reasons: Because Bluesky was back then and honestly is still today mostly centralized with the Bluesky corporation having a central chokepoint to control the network. Cory believes that one sometimes needs to make decisions based on one’s values. He just does not think that your values as someone not wanting to use LLMs matter.\n\nI mean, it was extraordinarily stupid for the Nazis to refuse Einstein’s work because it was “Jewish science,” but not merely because antisemitism is stupid.\n\nEverybody hates Nazis. Implying that one is in any way like the Nazis is just a killer argument. But let’s talk about Nazis for a second. The Nazis did a lot of psychological and medical research. On people they interned and later killed in concentration camps. There actually was a massive debate within especially psychology whether using the results of that kind of research is ethically possible. Utilitarianism of course argues that if it’s there one should use it but especially when your whole discipline is focused on understanding how our psyche works in order to for example help people in trauma just taking research that has been created through unthinkable violence and torture feels wrong. Feels contrarian to what your whole discipline is there for. This reminds me of Ursula K. Le Guin’s story “The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas“: Omelas is an almost perfect city. Rich, democratic, pleasant. But it only works by having one small child in perpetual torment. Okay, but if that kid is already suffering because those other people chose to, should you walk away? Of just reap the fruits of that suffering?\n\nSometimes you need to walk away.\n\nCory then repeats the strawmen we already talked about and lands here:\n\n“It’s not “unethical” to scrape the web in order to create and analyze data-sets. That’s just “a search engine””\n\nAgain, he twists the argument in the way that the AI corporations like to do it as well: Search engines scour the web so AI companies should be allowed the same. It’s the same technology! But what’s the purpose?\n\nA search engine scrapes pages to build an “index” in order to let people find those pages. The scraping has value for the page and its owner as well because it leads to more people finding it and therefore connecting to the writer, journalist, musician, artist, etc. Search engines create connection.\n\nAI scrapers do not guide people towards the original maker’s work. They extract it and reproduce it (often wrongly). “AI”‘s don’t point out to the web for you to find other’s work to relate to, they keep you in their loop and give you the answer cutting off any connection to the original sources.\n\nWhile the technology of scraping is the same, the purpose and material effects of those two systems is massively different. Again, Cory misrepresents the critique and tries to make it look unreasonable by making it just a conversation about tech without regarding how that technology affects the world and the people in it.\n\nI appreciate a lot of work Cory Doctorow has done in the last decades. But the arguments he presents here to defend his usage of LLMs for this rather trivial task (which TBH could probably be done reasonably well with traditional means) are part of why the Internet – and therefore the world – looks like it does right now. It’s a set of arguments that wants to delegitimize political and moral actions based on libertarian and utilitarian thinking.\n\nTechnologies are embedded not only in their deployment but also in their creation, conceptualization. They carry the understanding of the world that their makers believe in and reproduce those. A bit like an LLM reproduces the texts it learned from: It might not always be a 100% identical replica but it’s structurally so similar that the differences are surface level.\n\nIn order to build an Internet and a world that is more inclusive, fairer, freer we need to move past the dogma of unchecked innovation and technology. We need to re-politicize our conversations about technology and their effects and goals in order to build the structures (technological, political, social) we want. The structures that lead to a conviviality in harmony with the planet we all live on and will live on till the end of our days.\n\nThat path is paved with discussions about political and moral values. Discussions about how certain technological artifacts do align with those values or not.\n\nI do agree with Cory that demanding perfect purity lead nowhere. We are imperfect people in an imperfect world. I just do not think that this means to go all accellerationalist. Just turning the “open source” dial up to 11 does not stop the apocalypse. It’s a lot harder.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.",

    "description": ": Watchdogs warn models that can generate realistic images of people must comply with data protection laws",
    "fullText": "A global coalition of privacy watchdogs has fired a warning shot at the generative AI industry, saying companies churning out realistic synthetic images can't pretend that data protection rules don't apply.\n\nThe joint statement [PDF] signed by more than 60 regulators, including the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), boils down to a simple point: if your model can convincingly fake a person, you don't get to pretend data protection law doesn't exist.\n\n\"Recent developments – particularly AI image and video generation integrated into widely accessible social media platforms – have enabled the creation of non-consensual intimate imagery, defamatory depictions, and other harmful content featuring real individuals,\" said the signatories. \"We are especially concerned about potential harms to children and other vulnerable groups, such as cyberbullying and/or exploitation.\"\n\nThe warning lands weeks after the ICO and DPC opened formal probes into Elon Musk's xAI following reports that its Grok chatbot produced sexual images of real people without their consent.\n\nThe group says organizations dabbling in generative AI need to build safeguards from the start and think carefully about risks such as non-consensual imagery, misuse of someone's likeness, and potential harms to children – all areas where the tech has raced ahead of social norms and, in some cases, common sense.\n\nThe regulators stress that the law already covers this, and that firms don't get a free pass just because the content came from a machine.\n\nWilliam Malcolm, executive director of Regulatory Risk & Innovation at the ICO, said: \"People should be able to benefit from AI without fearing that their identity, dignity or safety are under threat. AI already plays a large role in all our lives, and everybody has a right to expect that AI systems handling their personal data will do so with respect. Responsible innovation means putting people first: anticipating the risks and building in meaningful safeguards to ensure autonomy, transparency, and control.\n\n\"Public trust is foundational to the successful adoption and use of AI. Joint regulatory initiatives like this show global commitment to high standards of data protection in AI systems and help provide regulatory certainty. We expect those developing and deploying AI to act responsibly. Where we find that obligations have not been met, we will take action to protect the public.\"\n\nThe joint statement on AI-generated imagery suggests that if companies want to keep pushing ever more realistic AI into everyday products, they should expect regulators to keep asking awkward questions about how it all works. ®",

    "fullText": "A fiscal note on the proposed Chicago Bears stadium construction package shows northwest Indiana residents could pay millions in new taxes, which could grow with use by visitors to the region.\n\nThe statement — prepared by the nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency — still includes many unknowns but does provide some baseline revenue estimates for hospitality-related taxes.\n\nUnder Senate Bill 27, a state-crafted authority would take out bonds to build the stadium. A bevy of taxes would provide revenue to make the annual bond payments.\n\nThe exact cost of the project is unknown at this time though the Chicago Bears have committed $2 billion and House Speaker Todd Huston said Thursday in unveiling the plan that as much as $1 billion in public funding could be involved.\n\nThe bill allows Lake and Porter counties to each adopt a 1% food-and-beverage tax by June 30, 2027. Revenue from these taxes would go to the Northwest Indiana Stadium Board.\n\nIf both counties impose the 1% food-and-beverage tax, they could collect an estimated total of at least $12 million to $18 million annually, according to the fiscal estimate datedFriday. The estimate is based on the existing food services industry in each county and revenue collected in counties that currently impose such taxes.\n\nChicago Bears call Indiana deal ‘step forward’ for building new stadium in Hammond\n\n“The actual amount of revenue in Lake and Porter counties would likely be greater to the extent the stadium project results in increased demand for food and beverages,” it said.\n\nThe bill allows Lake County to increase the local hotel tax rate from its current 5% to 10%. The county council is required to adopt an ordinance increasing the tax rate by June 30, 2027.\n\nRevenue received from the hotel tax increase could be at least $5.4 million annually. But the statement says “the actual innkeeper’s tax revenue distributed to the board would likely be greater once the stadium and other facilities have been built.”\n\nHammond could also establish a 12% admissions tax on tickets for events held in the stadium. The tax is imposed on tickets offered for sale to the public at a box office or authorized agent, and does not apply to season tickets or a personal seat license.\n\nAll revenue collected would go to the Northwest Indiana Stadium Board to pay debt owed by the board.\n\nThe fiscal estimates the tax would generate around $12 million annually once the facility begins holding events. However, the revenue could be greater depending on the events that are held at the stadium.\n\nThe 10% Marion County admissions tax, which applies to events held at Lucas Oil Stadium, Victory Field, Gainbridge Fieldhouse and the Indiana Convention Center, generated $31.3 million during fiscal year 2025.\n\nAnother provision in the bill would create the Northwest Indiana Professional Sports Development Area. It could include any facility or complex of facilities that is used to hold a professional sporting event, including a stadium, parking garages, training facilities, and other related areas as specified in the bill.\n\nIt provides for allocation of covered taxes, including taxes paid for wages earned by athletes playing home games in a sporting facility, to the tax area. It defines covered taxes as state sales and use tax; individual income tax; local income tax; food and beverage taxes. Those revenues can be used for costs related to financing, construction, operating, maintaining and administration of the facilities established as part of the area.\n\nThe fiscal analysis said the total capture for the new tax area is unknown, but it will be less than the Marion County Professional Sports Development Area. That area — containing three sports facilities, a convention center and training facility — brings in over $16 million a year.\n\nOne final section of the bill allows dollars captured through a renegotiation of the Indiana Toll Road lease in 2026 to be used by the Indiana Finance Authority to pay or reimburse any costs associated with transportation and infrastructure projects in the following counties associated with the stadium relocation: Elkhart, LaGrange, Lake, LaPorte, Porter, Steuben and St. Joseph.\n\nAn information request with the IFA is currently pending concerning how much in revenue could be received from a renegotiation of the lease of the Indiana Toll Road, the fiscal report said.\n\nSenate Bill 27 is set for a second reading in the Indiana House on Monday and will be finalized by Friday, when this year’s legislative session is set to conclude.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",

    "title": "Russia’s Mi-28 Havoc Attack Helicopter Has Tiny Crew Compartment To Pick Up Downed Pilots",
    "description": "Like the Mi-24 Hind before it, albeit to a far more austere degree, the Mi-28’s fuselage compartment can be used in a pinch for rescues.",
    "fullText": "As well as being a key component of Russia’s attack helicopter force in the war in Ukraine, the Mi-28 Havoc has been in the news recently on account of its apparent delivery to Iran. Meanwhile, one lesser-known aspect of the Mi-28 is its ability to transport two or three passengers in a cramped fuselage compartment, a feature that is seen clearly in a recently published video of the rotorcraft.\n\nMi-28NM attack helicopter • Preflight Checks & Takeoff.\n[b/n \"05\" yellow?]\n\nVGTRK(Feb. 2026) https://t.co/F5sBjCQ3rBpic.twitter.com/0QRbVgQFSN\n\n— Massimo Frantarelli (@MrFrantarelli) February 23, 2026\n\nThe footage in question originates with the state-owned Russia Television and Radio channel and shows a Russian Aerospace Forces Mi-28NM — the latest domestic version of the gunship — undergoing pre-flight checks at a forward airstrip somewhere in the Ukrainian conflict zone. The video reportedly dates from this month.\n\nAt the start of the video, a technician is seen handling hoses that run into the helicopter’s port-side rear fuselage via an open door. Typically, such hoses are attached to dehumidifier units, which then blow warm, dry air through the aircraft to keep everything dry. This is especially important for sensitive avionics in cold weather, as on this snowy airfield. Once the helicopter is fully powered up, it should keep itself warm enough for moisture not to be a problem.\n\nWhat’s most interesting, however, is that the open door provides a rare look into this rear-fuselage compartment, which has the capacity to carry two or three people, or an equivalent load of cargo. Of course, this is in addition to the Mi-28’s two crew seated in tandem in the cockpit — the weapon system operator/navigator forward and the pilot to the rear.\n\nA look at the door armor on a Mi-28 attack helicopter.https://t.co/PTEzmFYUeY pic.twitter.com/wy6am7wkh2\n\n— Rob Lee (@RALee85) May 27, 2019\n\nThe fuselage compartment, unique among in-service attack helicopters, was part of the Mi-28’s design when it was first schemed back in the second half of the 1970s. The Soviet Union had ordered Mil to design a new-generation combat helicopter, equivalent to the U.S. AH-64 Apache, but this feature was all its own.\n\nThe Mi-28’s configuration was broadly similar to the AH-64, but marked a significant move away from the philosophy enshrined in the previous Mi-24 Hind. As we have discussed in the past, the Mi-24 had been built around a passenger/cargo cabin — with space for a squad of infantry — although, as it was developed, it expanded its anti-armor capabilities, too.\n\nA walkaround video of a privately owned Mi-24 in the United States. The passenger/cargo cabin is seen in detail from around the 11:30 mark:\n\nIn contrast, the Mi-28 was a tank-killer first and foremost, with no cabin, and better overall performance. However, there was internal space for a much smaller compartment and one that would be very useful for retrieving downed pilots from the battle area, especially for grabbing a pilot who went down within the same flight. Bearing in mind the expected aircraft losses on Europe’s Central Front — especially among low-flying helicopters — this made a lot of sense.\n\nOther tasks could have included moving mechanics and tools to conduct limited repairs of other helicopters in an emergency. Potentially, it could even have been used for inserting and picking up infiltrators or saboteurs.\n\nHaving the option of using the Mi-28 as a kind of ad-hoc, or non-traditional combat search and rescue (CSAR) asset would also mean that the aircraft could operate on its own and on the fly if other air or ground assets were not available. Traditionally, CSAR helicopters have to operate with an armed escort. It’s unknown whether the passenger cabin has been used at all in the war in Ukraine, but the limited space, presence of avionics equipment, and complete lack of windows mean it’s only really suited to emergencies. For more typical CSAR missions in the Ukrainian theater, Mi-8 Hips and Mi-24s are typically used, with an escort of Mi-28 or Ka-52 Hokum attack helicopters.\n\nAs for other attack helicopter types attempting personnel recovery, the best-known incident is likely that involving two British Army Apache gunships in Afghanistan in January 2007. During that dramatic mission, four Royal Marines strapped themselves to the outside of two Apaches for an attempted combat rescue. Ultimately, they were only able to recover the body of their fallen comrade, Lance Corporal Ford, who had already been killed.\n\nThe Italian Army, too, has explored the concept of using its A129 Mangusta attack helicopters for personnel rescue, strapping a pair of soldiers to the main landing gear struts. Meanwhile, the U.S. Army Special Operations Command operates MH-6M Little Birds with side-mounted planks to externally airlift special operators. A more elaborate modular system, used to transport small numbers of personnel, was schemed for the Bell 360 Invictus armed scout helicopter, as you can read about here.\n\nIt’s also worth pointing out another planned ‘survival’ feature of the Mi-28, namely its crew-escape system. Unlike the Ka-52, the Mi-28 doesn’t have ejection seats. Instead, the Zvezda/Tomilino Pamir-K crew seats have belts that tighten automatically when high-g loads are encountered. As originally envisaged, the crew escape system would work as follows. During any kind of catastrophic failure at altitude, the cockpit doors would be blown off, the stub wings would be jettisoned together with their loads, and an inflatable door-sill sleeve would be filled with air. This was to protect the crew from the protruding main landing gear and cannon and help them clear the helicopter, after which they would return to the ground by parachute. In theory, at least.\n\nKa-52 alligator and its unique K-37-800M ejection seats.

(@VladZinen) December 11, 2020\n\nIn practice, it seems the crew escape system never reached operational status on the Mi-28, likely due to the very limited window in which it would be of practical use.\n\nAccording to the Oryx open-source tracking group, Russia has lost 19 Mi-28s since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine four years ago. This figure could be higher because Oryx only tabulates losses it can confirm visually. Russia began the conflict with a force of around 110 Mi-28s of all versions.\n\nVideo of the destruction of the Mi-28 of the\n\nFPV drone. The first recorded case pic.twitter.com/LWosDeX2Ah\n\n(@front_ukrainian) August 7, 2024\n\nThe Mi-28 has had a notably protracted history since it was first flown in prototype form in 1982. The original Havoc was abandoned by the early 1990s, and Mil pressed ahead with the radar-equipped, night-capable Mi-28N version. Deliveries of production Mi-28N helicopters to Russia began in 2008, and export versions have since been sold to Algeria, Iraq, Uganda, and, apparently, now also Iran.\n\nNewly delivered Russian Mi-28NE attack helicopter was spotted over Tehran, Iran. pic.twitter.com/Mq5x9q4NHh\n\n— Clash Report (@clashreport) February 3, 2026\n\nFor Russia, the basic version remains the Mi-28N, which also undertook combat operations in Syria starting in 2016.\n\nLess common is the Mi-28UB (only 24 of which were produced), which received a mast-mounted radar, lacking on the Mi-28N, and dual controls. As for the latest Mi-28NM version — as seen in the video above — this also has the mast-mounted radar and other changes, including new missiles. As well as having been ordered in quantity for Russia, there are also plans to bring older Mi-28N aircraft up to Mi-28NM standard.\n\nVideo of the radar-equipped Mi-28UB during a live-fire exercise in the Krasnodar region, March 2020:\n\nFor all the changes that the Mi-28 has undergone since it first appeared, its highly compact passenger compartment remains one of its most unusual features.\n\nContact the author: thomas@thewarzone.com",

    "fullText": "PARIS (AP) — France's top diplomat Monday requested that U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner no longer be allowed direct access to members of the French government after he skipped a meeting to discuss comments by the Trump administration over the beating death of a far-right activist.\n\nFrench authorities had summoned Kushner to the Quai d'Orsay, which houses the Foreign Affairs Ministry, on Monday evening but he did not show up, according to diplomatic sources.\n\nJean-Noel Barrot, the foreign affairs minister, moved to restrict Kushner's access “in light of this apparent misunderstanding of the basic expectations of the mission of an ambassador, who has the honor of representing his country.”\n\nThe ministry, however, left the door open for reconciliation.\n\n“It remains, of course, possible for Ambassador Charles Kushner to carry out his duties and present himself at the Quai d’Orsay, so that we may hold the diplomatic discussions needed to smooth over the irritants that can inevitably arise in a friendship spanning 250 years,” it said.\n\nKushner had been summoned following a statement by the State Department’s Counterterrorism Bureau, which posted on X that “reports, corroborated by the French Minister of the Interior, that Quentin Deranque was killed by left-wing militants, should concern us all.” The U.S. Embassy had posted that statement on social media.\n\nDeranque, a far-right activist, died of brain injuries this month from a beating in the French city of Lyon. He was attacked during a fight on the margins of a student meeting where a far-left lawmaker was a keynote speaker.\n\nHis killing highlighted a climate of deep political tension ahead of next year’s presidential vote.\n\n“We reject any instrumentalization of this tragedy, which has plunged a French family into mourning, for political ends,” Barrot said over the weekend. “We have no lessons to learn, particularly on the issue of violence, from the international reactionary movement.”\n\nThe State Department said in its post that “violent radical leftism is on the rise and its role in Quentin Deranque’s death demonstrates the threat it poses to public safety. We will continue to monitor the situation and expect to see the perpetrators of violence brought to justice.”\n\nKushner was summoned in August over his letter to French President Emmanuel Macron alleging the country did not do enough to combat antisemitism. France’s foreign officials met with a representative of the U.S. ambassador since the diplomat did not show up.",

    "fullText": "Russia’s invasion of Ukraine four years ago launched Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II, causing immense suffering for civilians and harrowing ordeals for soldiers while rewriting the post-Cold War security order.\n\nThe fighting enters its fifth year on Tuesday, and it shows no signs of stopping anytime soon.\n\nThe U.S. has brokered talks with delegations from Moscow and Kyiv as part of the Trump administration's yearlong push for peace. But reconciling key differences, such as the future of Russian-occupied Ukrainian land and postwar security for Ukraine, has thwarted progress.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of each countries’ troops have died on the battlefield, and Ukrainian civilians have been battered by Russian aerial strikes that have brought years of power outages and water cuts.\n\nHere’s a look at the conflict, by the numbers, since the full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nThe upper end of the estimated number of soldiers killed, wounded or missing on both sides, according to a report last month by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank.\n\nIt estimated that Russia suffered 1.2 million casualties, including up to 325,000 troop deaths, between February 2022 and December 2025 — what it said was the largest number of troop deaths for any major power in any conflict since World War II.\n\nRussia has not released figures on battlefield deaths since January 2023, when it said more than 80 soldiers were killed in a Ukrainian strike, bringing the total military deaths Moscow has confirmed to just over 6,000.\n\nCSIS estimated that Ukraine has seen 500,000 to 600,000 military casualties, including up to 140,000 deaths.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this month that 55,000 Ukrainian troops have died in the war. Many are missing, he said.\n\nNeither Moscow nor Kyiv gives timely data on military losses. Independent verification is not possible.\n\nThe U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission’s count for civilian deaths in Ukraine since Russia’s all-out invasion, though it says that is likely an underestimate. More than 40,600 civilians were injured over the same period, it said in a December report.\n\nThe war has killed at least 763 children, according to the U.N.\n\nLast year was the deadliest for civilians in Ukraine since 2022. The conflict killed 2,514 civilians and injured 12,142 in the country in 2025 — a 31% increase in civilian casualties over 2024, it said.\n\nThe percentage of Ukrainian land occupied by Russia, according to the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nOver the past year, Russia has gained just 0.79% of Ukraine’s territory in the grinding war of attrition, the Washington-based think tank said in calculations provided earlier this month to The Associated Press, underscoring the little progress Moscow's forces have made despite huge costs in troops and armor.\n\nBefore Russia’s all-out invasion, it controlled nearly 7% of Ukraine, including Crimea and parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the east, as Moscow-backed separatists fought the Ukrainian army, according to Ukrainian officials and Western analysts.\n\nThe percentage drop in foreign military aid to Kyiv last year compared with the annual average between 2022 and 2024, according to Germany’s Kiel Institute, which tracks assistance to Kyiv.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump stopped sending American weapons paid for by the U.S. to Ukraine after he took office just over a year ago. European countries, striving to make up the difference, increased their military aid last year by 67% compared with the 2022-2024 period, the institute said in a report this month.\n\nForeign humanitarian and financial aid to Ukraine fell by 5% last year in comparison with the average in the previous three years, it said.\n\nThe number of Ukrainian civilians who have left their country.\n\nSome 5.3 million of those people have found refuge in Europe, according to a report this month from the U.N. office in Ukraine.\n\nAdditionally, around 3.7 million Ukrainians forced out of their homes have moved elsewhere within the country, the U.N. said in December.\n\nUkraine's prewar population was more than 40 million.\n\nThe number of Russian attacks that affected the provision of medical care in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion, according to a report from the World Health Organization on Monday.\n\nThere was a nearly 20% increase in such attacks last year compared with 2024, the U.N. agency said.\n\nA report earlier in the month from the WHO documented at least 2,347 strikes on health care facilities, in addition to others that damaged vehicles and the storage of medical supplies.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "Bitcoin price faces $60 billion whale selling pressure as consolidation persists, raising risks of breakdown toward $60,000 support levels.",
    "fullText": "Bitcoin price is consolidating after recent volatility, trading within a neutral structure. The crypto king has struggled to establish a decisive trend over the past two weeks.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin remains rangebound, reflecting balanced pressure between buyers and sellers. This equilibrium suggests that investor behavior from here will likely determine the next directional move.\n\nOn-chain data indicates that younger holders are choosing to HODL rather than exit positions. HODL waves show that the supply held by investors aged one to three months has declined by 5%. This supply has matured into the three- to six-month cohort, signaling reduced short-term selling.\n\nThis shift reflects improving holder resilience despite recent drawdowns. Bitcoin investors who remain underwater are not engaging in panic-driven liquidation. Instead, coins are aging into longer-term categories, which historically supports price stability. Reduced short-term distribution often limits downside volatility and strengthens structural support zones.\n\nWant more token insights like this? \n\nWhile some holders’ behavior appears stable, whale activity presents a contrasting dynamic. Since February 13, large holders have moved approximately 900,000 BTC, valued at $60 billion. This transfer activity suggests that significant capital may be preparing to exit positions following limited price appreciation.\n\nPersistent whale selling can introduce supply shocks, particularly in range-bound conditions. Large distributions increase overhead resistance and weaken bullish momentum. If critical holders grow increasingly impatient, sustained selling pressure could undermine BTC’s stability and elevate the probability of a broader correction.\n\nBitcoin is trading at $66,188 at the time of writing after slipping below the $67,394 support level. The asset remains confined between $65,000 and $70,000. This consolidation range reflects ongoing equilibrium. A decisive breakout or breakdown will likely define the next major move in Bitcoin price.\n\nOver the past two weeks, BTC has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern. Price action shows no clear directional bias. However, continued whale selling could tip the balance downward. A breakdown below the triangle support may send Bitcoin toward $64,142. Losing that level would expose BTC to a potential decline toward $60,000. Notably, a recent long lower wick signaled dip buying interest.",

    "fullText": "It was supposed to be peak relaxation.\n\nKate Johnson and her husband, Sean, planned a 10-day ski vacation to Japan early last year. They figured it would be their last big trip for a while since they were trying to get pregnant.\n\nA few weeks before boarding the plane, the Hoboken couple found out they were expecting.\n\n“I weighed my options on being able to ski and figured that so early on in the pregnancy, it wouldn’t have that much of an effect,” Johnson, 38, told The Post. “Little did I know how that was going to turn out.”\n\nSpoiler alert: It went downhill fast. A harrowing fall while skiing in the backcountry of Japan complicated Johnson’s pregnancy in aggravating ways — and underscored how difficult it can be for pregnant women’s health concerns to be taken seriously.\n\nJohnson’s tumble came on her second day of skiing in the area of Nagano, the site of the 1998 Winter Olympics. She and Sean were being led by a guide up and down a mountain and throughout a nearby valley.\n\n“The second run down, I just caught like an edge. I got a little bit too much speed, and I sort of fell backwards,” the digital retail sales specialist recalled.\n\n“And when that happened, I sort of heard this pop,” she continued. “I don’t fall that often, so I didn’t really know exactly what was happening.”\n\nJohnson — who began skiing at 4 years old — tried to get her bearings. She was startled to hear a “massive cracking sound” in her right knee when she pulled her boot back on.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, she had fallen in an avalanche zone, so a helicopter came to dramatically rescue her.\n\nJohnson landed in a nearby hospital, where doctors suspected a patellar tendon injury but didn’t perform an MRI. Many doctors avoid MRIs in the first trimester as a precaution, even though there are no proven harmful effects on the fetus.\n\nJohnson was given “an enormous brace” and crutches to navigate the rest of her dream vacation.\n\nOnce she got back to the States, the real nightmare began.\n\nAt home in New Jersey, she struggled to find a doctor who would fix the problem.\n\nShe had to jump through hoops just to get an MRI, which revealed a full rupture of her ACL and a tear in her meniscus, the cartilage pad in the knee that absorbs shock and provides stability.\n\nMost of the 15 to 20 doctors she contacted suggested she wait until after she delivered to undergo surgery — but Johnson was ready to move forward.\n\n“[I] have a history of depression, anxiety and disordered eating, so movement is super important to me [for] regulating myself,” she explained.\n\nShe finally came upon Dr. Abigail Campbell, co-director of the NYU Langone Center for Women’s Sports Medicine.\n\nWhile some surgeons may postpone non-emergency procedures on pregnant women due to the potential risks of anesthesia, Campbell was game to do the procedure.\n\n“Like many things in pregnancy, [anesthesia] is one of those things that there has been minimal data on, so when unsure, it is assumed that it may not be safe in pregnancy,” Campbell told The Post.\n\n“However, there have been several studies in the past few years come out in the orthopedic trauma literature regarding safe practices and safe outcomes for surgery (for orthopedic injuries) in pregnant individuals.”\n\nJohnson’s medical team decided to perform the surgery when she was about 16 weeks along.\n\n“The second trimester is preferred for elective procedures in pregnant patients because of the confounding risk of spontaneous abortion (which is elevated in the first trimester) and the risk of preterm labor (which is higher in the third trimester),” Campbell noted.\n\nThe operation required a single X-ray, which confirmed that Johnson had actually torn the other meniscus in her right knee as well because her knee was so unstable.\n\nTo capture that image, Campbell and Johnson each had to wear two layers of lead aprons to protect their fetuses from radiation.\n\nCampbell, herself, was pregnant with a girl at the time.\n\n“Normally, surgeons wear one layer of lead aprons during surgery,” Campbell said. “On my end, wearing two layers of lead just made me hot during the procedure, but I had to do this all the time! Got used to it.”\n\nJohnson was given spinal anesthesia for the ACL reconstruction and meniscus repairs. The entire ordeal took over 90 minutes, during which Johnson’s baby was monitored to make sure he was OK.\n\nPost-procedure, Johnson had scar tissue and a couple of nights of restless leg syndrome to contend with, but her recovery went “surprisingly” well. That’s good news since she eschewed painkillers throughout the pregnancy.\n\nJohnson gave birth to son Brody on Oct. 3 — he clocked in at a healthy 6 pounds, 8 ounces.\n\n“Now it’s just a matter of building up the muscles that have sort of atrophied through non-use on both knees at this point,” Johnson said.\n\nFor her part, Campbell gave birth in July to daughter Louise.\n\nShe’s proud of Johnson’s recovery and her persistence in getting a variety of medical opinions.\n\n“Truly elective surgery, like cosmetic surgery, are not recommended, but in situations like this, in which waiting could result in long-term irreversible joint damage, the benefits outweigh the risks,” Campbell said about surgery while pregnant.\n\nAnd the whole misadventure hasn’t given Johnson cold feet for skiing.\n\n“I’m really lucky that this year the snow is so terrible that I’m not having horrible FOMO, but I’m already thinking about next year — when we can get back out and when we can get Brody on skis,” she confessed.",

    "fullText": "TORONTO (AP) — Canada announced Monday that it is working on an aid package for Cuba as it faces blackouts and severe fuel shortages worsened by a U.S oil embargo.\n\nForeign Minister Anita Anand declined to give details beyond that.\n\n“We are preparing a plan to assist. We are not prepared at this point to provide any details of the announcement,” Anand said.\n\nCuba is facing an increasingly dire energy crisis that has heightened in recent weeks after oil shipments from Venezuela, its main oil supplier, were halted when the U.S. attacked the South American country in early January and arrested its leader. Mexico, another major supplier, then also suspended oil shipments under U.S. pressure.\n\nAir Canada and other airlines have canceled flights to the Caribbean island because of a shortage of aviation fuel on the island.\n\nCanadian tourism is vital to Cuba’s economy. Global Affairs Canada, a governmental office, has said Canada is Cuba’s second-largest source of direct investment to the island, particularly in the mining and tourism sectors.\n\nCanada would join Mexico in providing aid.\n\nTwo Mexican Navy ships laden with humanitarian aid docked in Cuba earlier this month, two weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on countries that sell oil to the island, deepening an already severe economic and energy crisis in the Caribbean nation. The ships brought about 800 tons of goods, and another 1,500 tons of powdered milk and beans.\n\nThe economic crisis gripping Cuba since 2020 has been compounded by intensified U.S. sanctions aimed at forcing a change in the island’s political model. These pressures led to critical shortages and severe blackouts that peaked in early 2026.\n\nBecause Cuba produces only 40% of its required fuel, it remains highly vulnerable to external blockades. While strong allies like Russia and China have condemned the U.S. measures, their support has remained largely symbolic thus far.\n\nFollow AP’s Latin America coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

    "description": "With the Colorado River shrinking and its water rights in flux, the Central Arizona Project has assembled a coalition to campaign for its share.",
    "fullText": "A Central Arizona Project-backed advocacy group called the Coalition for Protecting Arizona’s Lifeline has begun rolling out television ads and online videos defending the water supplier’s rights to a Colorado River that is under serious hydrological and political strain.\n\n“Arizona is being unfairly targeted for reductions of Colorado River water that would cripple our state, flatten our economy and weaken our nation’s defense,” an ad aired by the coalition warns. It goes on to note that Arizona communities have done their part, committing more water for conservation in Lake Mead than those in other states, and that several options that the federal government is weighing for managing the river would fall hardest on the state.\n\nOne such alternative under review, CAP General Manager Brenda Burman recently said, would essentially dry up the agency’s canal from the river to Phoenix and Tucson.\n\n“In that alternative, they proposed to take us off the map,” she said. Three other alternatives do less harm to CAP. The agency has rejected all as unfairly penalizing Arizona while demanding much less from upstream states in particular.\n\nThe alternatives Burman was referring to were never stated as the Trump administration’s preference, but rather as ideas from which the seven states that share the river water might draw from in writing an agreement for sharing in its worsening shortages. Now that the states have failed to reach such an agreement, though, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is faced with either enacting something like them or rapidly developing a new federal plan in time to replace river guidelines that expire this autumn.\n\nNatural re\n\nIn normal times before the last quarter-century of drought, CAP was entitled to 1.6 million acre-feet of water — each acre-foot equating to roughly 326,000 gallons and enough to support about three households for a year. In those plentiful times Arizona took some of that water and sunk it in the ground for future use.\n\nIn recent years, Lake Mead's loss of stored water has forced CAP to forego more than 500,000 acre-feet a year. Worse cutbacks are on the horizon, but just how dry the canal will go depends on what rules the federal government imposes.\n\nAnticipating a fight, CAP formed the coalition last summer, announcing that discussions with the mayors of Phoenix, Tucson, Mesa and Surprise had led to its creation. Two dozen other mayors ultimately joined, along with leaders of several commerce groups and Native American tribes.\n\nThe coalition’s website and ads ask Arizonans to pledge their support for the effort to protect CAP water. The group has posted numerous video testimonials from members.\n\n“If there are major cuts or changes in how Colorado River water is allocated, the impacts on our communities and the entire state could be devastating,” Casa Grande Mayor Lisa Fitzgibbons said in one such testimonial. “That’s why Arizona and cities like Casa Grande are taking proactive steps to protect our water future,” including by a city demand management program.\n\nWhile the materials don’t directly state members’ intended method of securing water, some of the videos lean heavily on the so-called Law of the River and its guarantee of water from the four headwaters states to Arizona, California and Nevada. This theme reiterates a point that CAP and Arizona water officials have stressed over the last year or so, that if push comes to shove in a legal battle, they have the 1922 Colorado River Compact on their side.\n\nWater shortages: Without a deal on the Colorado River, deeper cuts loom. How 9 Arizona cities will respond\n\nTwo river tutorial videos note that the compact awarded the three states of the Lower Basin 7.5 million acre-feet of water per year on average plus half of the smaller U.S. obligation to Mexico, and stated that the Upper Basin states would not deplete the river flow below that level.\n\nTwentieth century negotiators from the Upper Basin conceded the point out of fear that California and Arizona could otherwise claim most of the river due to their earlier use of the water, according to the videos. In wet years the Upper Basin could use up to 7.5 million acre-feet itself, but in dry years it would allow at least that much to flow to the more developed Southwestern cities and farm districts.\n\n“This was an obligation,” a narrator states, “meaning a guarantee.”\n\nRead more Colorado River stories: \n\nThat’s a point that modern negotiators for the Upper Basin states have disputed, saying that the Lower Basin continues to use most of the water while it’s climate change rather than their own consumption that has reduced the supply.\n\n“We do not have a delivery obligation under the terms of the compact,\" Colorado state river commissioner Becky Mitchell said last year during a meeting of the Upper Colorado River Commission, \"and will not agree to impose one on ourselves through agreement now.\"\n\nAs states gear up for a potential showdown in court, CAP and its Coalition for Protecting Arizona’s Lifeline are making clear that they will demand compact compliance if other states don’t cut their uses sufficiently.\n\n“The Colorado River Compact isn’t just history,” one of the videos asserts. “It’s the foundation of Western water law. And it still dictates how the West shares its most important resource — water.”\n\nBrandon Loomis covers environmental and climate issues for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com.

    "description": "Whoopi Goldberg wonders if maybe the FBI wanted Patel out of the country for a bit simply so they could get work done without him",
    "fullText": "The hosts of “The View” were largely disgusted by video footage showing FBI director Kash Patel partying with the U.S. men’s Olympic hockey team in Milan this weekend, but Whoopi Goldberg offered a more “positive” spin on it. The ABC moderator suggested that maybe the FBI told Patel to go, simply to get him out of the way.\n\nIn the footage, Patel is seen celebrating in the locker room with the victorious U.S. team on Sunday, yelling and drinking. But, a spokesperson for the FBI insisted Patel was in Milan on official business, and that’s why he used a taxpayer-funded plane to get there. His trip to the Olympics just happened to coincide.\n\n“Maybe the folks in the FBI said ‘Yeah Kash, go do that,’ so they don’t have to deal with him,” Whoopi suggested on Monday. “Because they know he doesn’t know what he’s doing. They know that he is incompetent, they know he’s just — he’s a joke. And he’s a joke to the rest of the world, and because, for most of the people working in the FBI, it is not a joke, they’re the ones whose eyes are on the ball.”\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the women at the table weren’t so optimistic. Host Ana Navarro was quick to remind viewers that Patel has been accused of misusing the FBI plane before, and that he wasn’t the only one.\n\n“The bottom line is these people have no care about wasting taxpayer money, and they behave — I don’t even know what Kash Patel was doing there,” she said.\n\nBeyond the use of taxpayer money, the optics of Patel’s trip bothered host Sara Haines more, considering how many things are going on in this country.\n\n“Right now, the world doesn’t feel settled or stable, and you’ve got the head of the FBI, and the visual of chugging a beer in a locker room,” she said. “I just think it doesn’t — he’s already under scrutiny for a thousand reasons, because this administration has not been the defining of competence.”\n\n“So I think when you have someone like that, with all that’s going on, and then that’s what you see, I just think it’s a bit of an insult to the American people,” Haines continued.\n\nHaines lamented that she misses the days when FBI directors weren’t so prominent, which prompted guest host Amanda Carpenter to explain why that was the case and precisely why she was so bothered by the footage as well.\n\n“The reason we don’t see them is because they’re usually busy,” she said. “There’s a lot of things to do. And god forbid something happens, and it could’ve been prevented, and it wasn’t because he was concerned about hanging around in the men’s hockey locker room.”\n\n“The View” airs weekdays at 11 a.m. ET on ABC.\n\nThe post ‘The View’: Whoopi Wonders If FBI Told Kash Patel to Go to the Olympics ‘So They Don’t Have to Deal With Him’ appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "While the Big Mac has been McDonald's premium sandwich for over 50 years, it wasn't on the menu when the chain opened its first restaurant in 1940.\n\nBack then, the idea of a premium burger conflicted with the broader concept of having a simple menu that could be delivered quickly. Back in those early days, the chain focused on a simple offering of burgers, cheeseburgers, fries, and sodas.\n\nIt was actually 27 years later when the chain's corporate leaders gave Michael James “Jim” Delligatti, a franchise operator, permission to launch a burger with two patties.\n\n\"The Big Mac made its debut on April 22 in 1967. According to The New York Times, the first newspaper ads for the specialty sandwich described it as a burger with 'two freshly ground patties, tangy melted cheese, crisp lettuce, pickle, and our own Special Sauce.' Early printed ads also often included the catch phrase 'A meal disguised as a sandwich,' to emphasize the burger’s size,\" Food & Wine reported.\n\nThe Big Mac was a hit that went on to become the chain's enduring signature offering. Since 1967, however, McDonald's has tried many times to create new signature, premium burgers, and aside from the Quarter Pounder with Cheese, the chain has failed many times.\n\nDespite failures like the Arch Deluxe, and Angus Third Pounders, McDonald's has decided to launch a new premium burger, the Big Arch.\n\nCFO Ian Borden has talked about why the company has struggled with higher-end offerings in the past.\n\n“We thought the opportunity was about premium burgers, which was wrong,” he said at a UBS Global Consumer and Retail Conference in 2024, Business Insider reported. “We weren’t successful.”\n\nInstead, he noted, customers want a larger, more satisfying burger. The Big Arch, which launches March 3, will attempt to meet that demand.\n\nMcDonald's will launch the Big Arch at a time when consumers are seeking value and when rivals, including Chipotle, have leaned into the added-protein trend.\n\n\"Protein is hot. Everybody is into protein,” McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski said in an Instagram video.\n\nIn addition to Chipotle's protein menu, Starbucks has added protein-infused coffees, and many chains are promoting protein on their menus.\n\nChipotle’s new consumer strategy raises eyebrows\n\nBurger King revives iconic kids’ meal toys after 22 years\n\nWalmart surprises shoppers with bold new restaurant offering\n\nThis year, 28.4% of U.S. restaurant menus call out “protein,” up from 5.9% a decade ago, according to Datassential, CNBC reported.\n\n“A lot of younger consumers are more proactive about their health habits, so they’re looking for ways to support health now but also to support their health in the future,” said Julia Mills, a food and drink analyst for market research firm Mintel told the news site.",

    "description": "The proposed legislation would revise the state’s criminal code to charge abortion patients with fetal homicide, a crime punishable by life imprisonment, life without parole, or, yes, the death penalt...",
    "fullText": "In a wildly ridiculous case of GOP lawmakers wanting to make everything about ultimately banning abortion and punishing abortion patients, two (he/him) lawmakers in Tennessee have proposed a bill that would charge abortion patients with homicide.\n\nRep. Jody Barrett (R) and Sen. Mark Pody (R) have introduced House Bill 570 and Senate Bill 738, which, if passed, would revise the state’s criminal code to charge abortion patients with fetal homicide. Some media outlets have highlighted that this could mean abortion patients could receive the death penalty, which Rep. Barrett denies. But even though it’s true that their bill doesn’t explicitly mention the death penalty, punishment for fetal homicide can include life imprisonment, life without parole, or, yes, the death penalty.\n\nThe bill also removes protection for pregnant people. For the most part, states with abortion bans look to punish the doctor, healthcare provider, or anyone who helps someone get an abortion, not the abortion seeker themselves. But HB 570 and SB 738 would consider any harm done to a fetus as harm done to an individual “born alive” or, in other words, prioritize protections for a fetus over the pregnant person carrying them.\n\nWhile the bill has yet to be voted on, it would take effect on July 1 if it passes—though it would not apply to any cases before then.\n\nA post shared by AGirlHasNoPresident (@agirlhasnopresident)\n\nThe legislation was initially announced by anti-abortion group Foundation to Abolish Abortion (FAA), and was endorsed by the Southern Baptist Convention—or the same denomination that made headlines in 2019 for overlooking and enabling a system of church leaders who raped, molested, and abused hundreds of victims. It was also backed by Reps. Bud Hulsey (R), Ed Butler (R), and Monty Fritts (R)—the latter of whom defended the bill by telling the Tennessee Holler in late January that “murder is murder. I know that’s hard for people to hear, and I don’t mean to be hard with it, I promise.”\n\nTennessee is one of 13 states with a near-total abortion ban, and also considered one of the strictest bans in the country—while it has a vague exception for the life of the mother, the ban has zero exceptions for rape or incest. In July, one doctor also used the states newly-passed Medical Ethics Defense Act to deny a pregnant woman prenatal care because she was unmarried.\n\nSo far in 2026, three states, in addition to Tennessee, have tried to advance legislation aiming to classify abortion as murder. Ten states tried (and failed) to do the same in 2025. It’s a risky move for the GOP ahead of the midterms—as abortion rights remain overwhelmingly popular in the U.S. But if they want to dig their own grave, they have our blessing to shovel away.\n\nLike what you just read? You’ve got great taste.  Plus, you’ll be supporting independent journalism—which, can you even imagine not supporting independent journalism in times like these? Yikes.",

    "fullText": "Are aliens real? The question has animated conspiracy theories for decades and enthralled at least one former president of the United States. In a recent interview, Barack Obama became the first American president to affirm a belief in the existence of extraterrestrial life, but insisted that it was not being stored inside the top-secret Area 51 military base in Nevada.\n\nFor Bill Diamond, the president and chief executive of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute (Seti) in California, Obama’s beliefs are hardly radical. Seti is the world’s leading research organisation dedicated to the scientific search for life beyond our planet – and Diamond insists that aliens are out there.\n\n“Oh yes,” says the 69-year-old scientist. “I do believe aliens are real. Definitely… It is one of the questions we ask if you want to get a job at Seti. If you don’t believe in aliens, there’s probably no point having a job with us.” Diamond’s job involves overseeing teams of scientists working on various projects and sifting through torrents of data from radio telescopes, searching for patterns that nature alone cannot explain.\n\nDiamond is careful, though, to draw distinctions in what he means by aliens. He is not talking about flying saucers and abductions. “Life is probably very common in the universe,” he says. “It’s when you start talking about complex organisms, intelligence and then, ultimately, technology that it becomes a different matter.\n\n“The conditions that would allow for [aliens] to exist, which are mostly time and evolution, are probably not going to be as common as the conditions that allow just basic cellular life to emerge. But statistically speaking, there will be many examples of intelligent and ultimately technological life on other worlds.”\n\nSo if they do exist, what will they look like? Public imagination of aliens in film and fiction are of little men flying through our skies in spaceships and etching elaborate patterns into wheat fields. Diamond smiles at the cliché. Reality, he believes, is both less theatrical and far harder to picture.\n\n“It’s very hard for us to imagine what aliens would be like,” he says, but points to the biodiversity of our own planet which may offer clues. Aliens may even be similar to creatures like jellyfish, he suggests. “We have jellyfish that, from my point of view, are pretty extraordinary looking, a bit like aliens – and various sea creatures and birds and reptiles and mammals and so forth.” On Earth alone, evolution has produced creatures that seem almost otherworldly. Octopuses with nervous systems that extend into their arms, whales capable of complex communication. If such diversity exists under one sky, perhaps it’s not so difficult to imagine stranger things still under another.\n\nThe same physical laws apply everywhere, Diamond notes. Gravity, chemistry and energy behave the same way across the known universe. This does not mean that aliens would look human but it does mean that they would be shaped by similar constraints. “They will obviously be shaped by their environment. A bigger planet than Earth is going to have a stronger gravitational field that’s going to require an organism that is capable of withstanding that gravitational pull so likely to be a more robust physical species. A planet slightly smaller would have a lower gravitational field that might allow for more spindly, less structurally solid beings.”\n\nSo if aliens do exist, how would they get in touch? Diamond is clear about what he does not expect. “I think crop circles are rather unlikely,” he says. “If you’re an advanced civilisation, and you are able to be here in some capacity, having a presence or impact on our planet and you wanted to get our attention or have the technology to visit Earth in some direct or impactful way, you have technology far beyond our ability to imagine.”\n\nSuch a civilisation would not stumble upon us. It would already know we were here. It would have studied our atmosphere, our radio signals. It would understand our level of technology and, almost certainly, our languages, Diamond says.\n\nInstead, he believes that contact is far more likely to come as a signal. “First contact is most certainly going to be an observation of a phenomena that nature doesn’t produce, that we can say that’s technology,” he says. “Certainly, if an advanced civilisation wanted to get in touch or contact us, radio transmission would be one of the most efficient and effective ways.”\n\nHowever, he jokes that even if aliens could contact us, they might not want to. “There is a joke amongst some researchers,” he says. “When alien spacecraft fly by the Earth, they lock the doors.”\n\nAt Seti, Diamond describes three ways that scientists search for life. The first is “in situ” exploration, sending instruments directly to a place of interest. Nasa’s Perseverance rover is currently exploring Mars to determine whether life exists or once existed there. That approach, for now, is limited to our own solar system. The second is remote observation. The James Webb Space Telescope can examine the atmospheres of distant planets up to around 1,000 light years away. The third is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence itself, though Diamond prefers a more precise description. What Seti is really seeking, he says, is extraterrestrial technology, something that acts as a proxy for life and intelligence.\n\nSo, when might all of this happen? “A Seti discovery could happen tomorrow, it might not happen for a thousand years, we don’t know,” Diamond says. “But one of the things we also say in this business is that the probability for finding life beyond Earth if you don’t look for it is zero.”\n\nThe challenge, he explains, is scale. If a signal was sent from Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to our solar system, it would only take four years to get here. Yet if an alien civilisation 1,000 light years away sent a message today, it would not reach us for 10 centuries. If we replied, our response would take just as long. Therefore, any exchange would unfold across generations rather than lifetimes.\n\nThat does not dampen his optimism. Humanity has been technologically capable for barely a century. In that time, we have gone from inventing radio to building space telescopes that can study worlds hundreds of light years away. Given enough time, our reach will expand.\n\nA confirmed detection would be historic. Diamond and his colleagues are already thinking about what it would mean. What will that discovery do to humanity as we know it? Change it for the better, Diamond hopes.\n\n“Whatever the nature of the discovery, almost certainly it will have an impact on us,” he says. “How will it impact religious beliefs and how will it impact governments and international diplomacy?”\n\nFor a man who spends his days contemplating vast distances and civilisations he may never see, the conclusion is strikingly human. “I hope we will be excited by the news and not threatened by it. Maybe people would finally realise we are all on this one planet as one little island and in this together so it might be smart for us to co-operate instead of fighting with each other.”\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "As a dietitian, I know bananas are healthy. But what would happen if I decided to eat a banana every day for a week? Find out here.",
    "fullText": "As a dietitian, I know the importance of nutrition. Fruits, including bananas, provide essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber our bodies need. Despite this, I will admit that there are days when I don’t quite meet my own fruit quota. So in an effort to up my intake, I decided to challenge myself to eat a banana every day for a week.\n\nIf you’re like me, bananas are probably one of those foods you don’t think twice about. It’s easy to grab when running out the door, sweet enough to feel like a treat, and tasty in recipes from smoothies to banana bread. It would be simple to eat one every day, right? Here’s how my week with bananas unfolded and what I learned along the way.\n\nBefore getting started, I reflected on how often bananas naturally made an appearance in my diet. I realized that while I wasn’t eating them daily, I did enjoy them in several forms—blended into smoothies, sliced over yogurt, or spread with peanut butter as a quick snack. I figured eating one each day wouldn’t be difficult, and I was curious to see if I’d notice any tangible benefits.\n\nOver the next several days, I made a point to eat a banana a day. And honestly, it was easy to do, thanks in large part to the fact that bananas don't need to be refrigerated. Running to my car, I grabbed a banana to hang onto for when hunger pangs hit, and I was so happy I had it with me when I got hungry. One day for dessert, I sliced a banana over Icelandic Provisions salted caramel and banana skyr (tastes like banana pudding). And another day, I leaned on a classic peanut butter, banana, and honey sandwich at lunchtime. It required very little effort to add a banana to my days.\n\nAs the week went on, I noticed some pleasant changes. My energy levels felt steadier, especially during the busy mid-morning hours when I’d usually start searching for a quick pick-me-up. Bananas gave me a satisfying boost without the jitters or crash I sometimes get from sugary snacks. I felt more satisfied and less likely to reach for less healthy options.\n\nDigestively, things seemed to move along more smoothly, too. While the difference wasn’t extreme, it was certainly positive. I didn’t feel bloated like I do on occasion, and my bowel movements were regular. Plus, having that daily banana seemed to curb my sweet tooth, so I wasn’t tempted by mid-afternoon sweets as much. Overall, it was a simple change that left me feeling good!\n\nBananas are nutritional powerhouses. A medium-sized banana is considered a single serving. Here’s the breakdown of what you get in one medium banana:\n\nBananas also deliver plenty of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that deliver scientifically-backed benefits. Some of the most impressive ones include:\n\nPotassium is a critical nutrient that supports heart health and helps maintain proper blood pressure. One medium banana provides about 375 milligrams of potassium, making it a great way to meet your daily needs of about 2,600–3,400 milligrams. If you struggle with muscle cramps after workouts or occasional fatigue, adequate potassium intake might help ease those symptoms.\n\nBananas are an excellent source of dietary fiber, with one medium banana providing about 3 grams of fiber. Fiber plays a significant role in supporting regular bowel movements and promoting healthy gut bacteria. What’s more, slightly underripe bananas offer a unique benefit: They’re a source of prebiotic fiber. Prebiotic fiber feeds the “good” bacteria in your gut, which supports a healthy digestive system and can improve overall gut health.\n\nOne medium banana contains about 0.4 milligrams of vitamin B6, which is roughly 25% of the daily recommended intake for adults. The benefits of vitamin B6 are vast, but it particularly supports brain health, aiding the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine that regulate mood.\n\nBananas are predominantly made up of carbohydrates, with about 27 grams per medium banana. Thanks to their natural sugars and the fiber they contain, bananas provide a steady source of energy, making them ideal before a workout or as a pick-me-up snack.\n\nBananas contain several antioxidants, including vitamin C. Antioxidants help neutralize free radicals in the body, reducing oxidative stress and potentially lowering the risk of certain chronic diseases.\n\nBecause bananas are about 75% water, they contribute to your overall hydration. Combining their potassium content with this water content makes them a fantastic post-workout snack to help replenish lost electrolytes and fluids.\n\nWhile bananas are packed with nutrients, like any food, they’re best enjoyed in moderation. Eating too many bananas in a short timeframe may result in an overload of certain nutrients, such as potassium. Though this is rare, too much potassium (a condition called hyperkalemia) can lead to issues like heart irregularities if your kidneys can’t process the excess properly, or even dialysis.\n\nFor most people, eating one to two bananas a day is perfectly safe. If you focus on a balanced diet with a variety of fruits, it prevents overdoing any one thing.\n\nAnother thing to consider is bananas’ carbohydrate and sugar content. If you’re monitoring your blood sugar closely, be mindful of your portion size and pair bananas with some protein or fat, like almond butter or yogurt, to help support healthy blood glucose levels.\n\nBananas do make an excellent grab-and-go snack, but there are also many other easy and delicious ways to enjoy them on a regular basis. Here are some that I recommend:\n\nSmoothies: Slice a banana and toss it into your blender with yogurt, milk, and your favorite fruits for a quick breakfast or snack.\n\nOn toast: Pair banana slices with nut butter on whole grain toast for a filling, balanced meal.\n\nDesserts: Freeze ripe bananas to make creamy “nice cream” as a healthier alternative to ice cream.\n\nBaking: Use mashed bananas in recipes like banana bread or muffins for natural sweetness.\n\nToppings: Add sliced bananas to your cereal, oatmeal, or yogurt for some extra flavor and nutrients.\n\nAfter eating a banana every day for a week, I can confidently say that incorporating a banana into your daily routine comes with some impressive benefits. They’re convenient, affordable, and packed with essential nutrients like vitamins B6 and C that can boost energy, support digestion, and enhance overall health.\n\nThat said, balance and variety are key. I enjoy a wide range of fruits every day, including bananas, to ensure a diverse mix of nutrients. For those who don’t eat fruit regularly but enjoy bananas, they’re a simple, delicious, and budget-friendly way to start adding more nutrition to your diet. This versatile fruit truly punches above its weight!\n\nCan Apple Cider Vinegar Lead to Weight Loss?\n\nBobbi Brown Shares Her Top Face-Transforming Makeup Tips for Women Over 50",

    "fullText": "Civil unrest in Mexico following the death of a cartel leader led to flight cancellations on Sunday, Feb. 22, and Monday, Feb. 23, including flights to and from Mexico out of major California airports such as LAX and SFO.\n\nViolence erupted in western Mexico on Feb. 22 after a military operation that killed cartel leader Nemesio Oseguera, known as \"El Mencho.\"\n\nThe U.S. Embassy & Consulates in Mexico issued a security alert for the Mexican states of Jalisco, Tamaulipas, Michoacan, Guerrero and Nuevo Leon that urged U.S. citizens to shelter in place because of \"ongoing security operations and related road blockages and criminal activity.\"\n\nSeparately, a Northeast blizzard has canceled flights from Sky Harbor to Northeast cities like New York City, Boston, Newark and Philadelphia.\n\nLos Angeles International Airport, or LAX, had 128 flights out of and into the airport canceled as of 10 a.m. on Feb. 23, according to FlightAware.\n\nLAX's site showed that several flights departing had been canceled, with the majority being East Coast destinations including New York, Newark and Boston. Flights to Puerto Vallarta and Guadalajara were also canceled for Feb. 23.\n\nFlight Aware also showed that 86 flights into or out of San Francisco International Airport, or SFO, had been canceled on Monday, including all incoming flights from Boston Logan International, John F. Kennedy International and Newark Liberty International.\n\nA statement from the Mexican government said the Special Forces of the Mexican Army were conducting an arrest of Oseguera, head of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. The Mexican Army was attacked during their operation, leading to a shootout.\n\nSeven cartel members died in the operation, including Oseguera. Four died on the scene; three, including Oseguera, died while being transported to Mexico City.\n\nA wave of violence spread in response to Oseguera's death, including the burning of buses and blockages of roads.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs posted on X that U.S. citizens in locations affected by the violence should shelter in place, adding that most domestic and international flights were canceled in Puerto Vallarta and Guadalajara.

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Nick Reiner, the 32-year-old son of Hollywood luminary Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner, pleaded not guilty Monday to two counts of first-degree murder more than two months after their deaths, denying for the first time that he fatally stabbed his parents.\n\nReiner’s attorney, Deputy Public Defender Kimberly Greene, entered the plea on his behalf as he stood behind glass in an enclosed custody area of the packed Los Angeles courtroom.\n\nThe third of Rob Reiner’s four children, Nick Reiner has been held without bail since his arrest hours after beloved actor-director Reiner and photographer and producer Singer were found dead on Dec. 14 at their home in the upscale Brentwood section of Los Angeles.\n\nReiner appeared in court with a shaved head and light facial hair, wearing brown jail clothes. He talked to his lawyer briefly through the glass before the judge began the hearing. At one point a low door in the enclosure was opened and they crouched down and spoke face-to-face. During the hearing, he spoke only to answer yes when the judge asked if he waived his right for next steps of the case to proceed speedily.\n\nReiner was not wearing the suicide prevention smock he wore in his first court appearance in December days after his parent's killings. It was the third time he had been set to enter a plea, but issues surrounding the high-stakes, closely watched case, including a surprising change in defense lawyers, kept it from happening until Monday.\n\nThe judge told Reiner to return to court April 29 for the scheduling of a preliminary hearing where prosecutors will present evidence and a new judge will decide if it’s enough for Reiner to go to trial.\n\nThe case will now be handled by longtime Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Sam Ohta. He has had many prominent murder, manslaughter and public corruption cases in his courtroom in recent years, but none have drawn the national media attention this case has.\n\nDistrict Attorney Nathan Hochman said outside court that his office still hasn’t decided whether it will seek the death penalty for Reiner. Hochman said the death penalty decision “goes through a very rigorous process. We will be looking at all aggravating and mitigating circumstances.”\n\nReiner’s not guilty plea is common for criminal defendants at this stage of the case, whatever their longer-term plan might be.\n\nReiner’s former attorney, the high-profile private lawyer Alan Jackson, had to quit the case at the previous hearing, citing reasons beyond his and his client’s control that ethics wouldn't let him reveal. But in parting, he adamantly declared that “pursuant to the laws of California, Nick Reiner is not guilty of murder,” a stance made official by Reiner's plea Monday.\n\nAuthorities have said nothing about possible motives, and leaks in the case have been virtually nonexistent on both sides, leaving some of the most basic questions about the killing unanswered publicly.\n\nRob Reiner, 78, and Michele Singer Reiner, 70, died from “multiple sharp force injuries,” the LA County Medical Examiner said in initial findings. Authorities said they were killed hours before the bodies were discovered. A court order has prevented the public release of more details.\n\nDeputy District Attorney Habib Balian said Monday that his office is still awaiting the full autopsy report from the Medical Examiner, but all other evidence has been turned over to the defense.\n\nRob Reiner was a prolific director whose work included some of the most memorable and endlessly watchable movies of the 1980s and ’90s. His credits included “This is Spinal Tap,” “Stand By Me,” “A Few Good Men,” and “When Harry Met Sally… ,” during the production of which he met photographer Michele Singer. They wed soon after and were married for 36 years.",

    "fullText": "Chronically online MAGA Congressman Mike Lee should have just kept this one in the drafts.\n\nThe Utah senator, 54, shared a photo on X on Sunday afternoon of masked Mexican cartel members, calling out “leftists” in an attempted double standards gotcha moment regarding the idea that ICE agents should not wear masks to hide their identities.\n\n“Cartel hitmen wear masks,” Lee, from his personal @BasedMikeLee account, wrote. “Leftists aren’t complaining.”\n\nHowever, the senator was quick to delete his post after a few prominent Democrats responded, calling out how Lee’s argument unintentionally backfired.\n\n“Yes. Cartel hitmen wear masks. That’s why ICE shouldn’t,” wrote Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n“Oh dear Mike,” wrote Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy. “I literally couldn’t make our argument better than you do. The bad guys wear masks. The good guys don’t.”\n\nHawaii Senator Brian Schatz replied, “Mike, I would like ICE to have the same standards as a local police department, not cartel hitmen.”\n\nLee’s posting of polarizing rhetoric on social media, only to delete it later, is nothing new.\n\nIn June 2025, after Democratic Minnesota state representative Melissa Hortman and her husband were assassinated in their home by Trump voter Vance Boelter, the GOP congressman tweeted and deleted some incredulous accusations blaming liberals for her death.\n\nIn one deleted post, Lee called the killing a “Nightmare on Waltz Street” in a misspelled effort to pin the blame on the state’s Democratic governor and staunch Trump administration adversary, Tim Walz.\n\nIn another deleted post, Lee said, “This is what happens... When Marxists don’t get their way.”\n\nMS NOW host Lawrence O’Donnell said the senator was “not well” in the wake of his comments regarding the fatal shooting of Hortman and her husband.\n\n“Mike Lee appears to be in an agonizing mental struggle with how to be a human being,” O’Donnell, 74, said on The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell last year.\n\n“100 tweets a day is not healthy,” he continued, referring to the congressman’s avid social media usage as reported by the Salt Lake Tribune. “No United States senator actually doing the job of senator would have the time for 100 tweets a day, or even 10 tweets a day.”\n\nThough Lee deleted his posts about Hortman’s assassination, the Utah senator never officially apologized for his comments.",

    "title": "In less than a year, Trump erased 12 years of solvency for the trust fund that pays for Medicare Part A",
    "description": "The CBO estimates that benefit reductions would start at 8% in 2040 and steadily climb to a 10% cut by 2056.",
    "fullText": "Recent policy changes and economic shifts have slashed 12 years off the projected life span of the trust fund that pays for Medicare Part A, according to a newly updated report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund is now slated to be entirely exhausted by 2040, even though the balance generally increases through 2031, as spending will begin to outstrip income in the following year.\n\nThis rapid deterioration of Medicare’s financial solvency represents a stark drop from the CBO’s previous estimate, which was published just last year, in March 2025. The dramatically shortened timeline means future retirees could face significant cuts to vital health care services far sooner than previously anticipated. As required by the Deficit Control Act, CBO Director Phillip Swagel noted the projections reflect the assumption benefits would be paid as scheduled even after the HI trust fund was exhausted.\n\nThe primary culprit for this accelerated depletion is a sharp reduction in the fund’s projected income, heavily driven by legislation passed over the last year. Specifically, the 2025 reconciliation act (Public Law 119-21, more commonly known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act) significantly reduced the revenues the trust fund normally receives from taxing Social Security benefits. This legislation lowered tax rates and established a temporary deduction for taxpayers age 65 or older. Consequently, this major policy shift enacted during the Trump administration has directly contributed to starving the Medicare safety net of critical future funding.\n\nThe HI trust fund is the financial backbone for Medicare Part A, which covers essential services including inpatient hospital care, stays in skilled nursing facilities, home health care, and hospice care. Over the next 30 years, the fund is expected to rely on the Medicare payroll tax for about three-quarters of its annual income, with another roughly one-eighth derived from income taxes on Social Security benefits.\n\nHowever, the recent tax cuts are not the only factor draining the fund. The CBO also cited decreased projections for payroll tax revenues, warning it had to adjust their models to account for lower expected worker earnings. Furthermore, because the trust fund will have smaller balances going forward, it will generate less interest income, creating a compounding negative effect on its overall finances.\n\nOn the other side of the ledger, Medicare spending is rising faster than anticipated. The CBO noted per-enrollee spending in Medicare Part A’s fee-for-service program in 2025, along with 2026 bids by Medicare Advantage plan providers, both came in higher than expected.",

    "fullText": "LEFT: Lauren Boebert (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call via AP Images) RIGHT: Tony Gonzales (Francis Chung/POLITICO via AP Images)\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) called on Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-TX) to resign on Monday, hours after 24sight News reported on inappropriate text messages that Gonzales sent to Regina Santos-Aviles, a former staffer who committed suicide by self-immolation last September.\n\nThe new messages — in which Gonzales asked Santos-Aviles to send him “a sexy pic” and fantasized about being “On top pinning your legs” — were produced less than a week after another former Gonzales employee who described himself as Santos-Aviles’s “best friend” told the  San Antonio Express-News that Santos-Aviles had admitted the affair to him, and that she had been battling depression ever since her husband found out about the relationship, causing the congressman to “abruptly cut her off.” The staffer also produced text messages in which Santos-Aviles admitted to the affair.\n\nGonzales has repeatedly denied the allegations that he had an affair with Santos-Aviles, and blamed last week’s story on his primary opponent in a statement that read:\n\nMs. Santos-Aviles was a kind soul who devoted her life to making the community a better place. Her efforts led to improvements in school safety, healthcare, and rural water like never before. It’s shameful that Brandon Herrera [Gonzales’s primary opponent] is using a disgruntled former staffer to smear her memory and score political points, conveniently pushing this out the very day early voting started. I am not going to engage in these personal smears and instead will remain focused on helping President Trump secure the border and improve the lives of all Texans.\n\nAt least one of his colleagues is not convinced of his innocence, though. Boebert called on Gonzales to resign after the publication of the incriminating text messages.\n\n.@RepTonyGonzales, RESIGN! https://t.co/sOjPAt0CWS\n\n— Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) February 23, 2026\n\nBoebert’s demand is notable given the fact that Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) and the GOP command the smallest majority in nearly a century. If Gonzales were to resign, it would shrink further to 217-214, with four vacancies. The tight margin of error is particularly notable given the fact that some Republicans, including Reps. Don Bacon (R-NE) and Thomas Massie (R-KY), have proven willing to defect and vote with the Democrats on myriad issues.\n\nThe post JUST IN: Lauren Boebert Demands Fellow House Republican Resign Amid Growing Scandal first appeared on Mediaite.",

However, a few just didn't capture my heart in the same way.\n\nHere are three Greek islands I'd return to and two I'd skip in the future.\n\nSymi is easily one of my favorite Greek Islands because it feels more lowkey than some of the more famous spots like Mykonos or Santorini.\n\nFor stunning views overlooking the bay, I recommend hiking up the Kali Strata's hundreds of stairs. I also suggest joining a full-day boat trip with Poseidon cruises or hopping on a water taxi to visit one of the nearby beaches.\n\nIn my opinion, Milos has some of the most stunning beaches in Greece.\n\nOne of the most well-known spots is Sarakiniko Beach, which is famous for its lunar landscape — a series of smooth, white, volcanic rock formations that resemble the surface of the moon.\n\nI recommend renting a car to explore Milos by land, but don't skip a boat trip around the island as well — some of the best swim spots are only accessible from the water.\n\nSeveral tiny fishing villages also add a unique factor to this island. In some of them, traditional boathouses have been renovated into cozy, waterfront villas and hotels. I recommend booking one for a truly immersive experience.\n\nSkiathos is a charming island filled with great local shops and some of the best Greek food I've had during my travels. It also has a lively nightlife scene, with plenty of bars and clubs that stay open late.\n\nDuring the day, you can hop on a boat or a bus to explore the many beaches in the area. In the evening, I recommend taking advantage of lengthy happy hours at the many cocktail bars offering sunset views.\n\nIf you love \"Mamma Mia,\" Open Air Cinema hosts special screenings of the movie — after all, parts of it were filmed on the island. I recommend grabbing tickets early because they sell out quickly.\n\nMykonos is known for its upscale beach clubs, lively bars, and cute old town. It delivers on all of these fronts, but in my opinion, it does so at a cost.\n\nIt's known as one of the pricier Greek islands to visit, and although I enjoyed my time there, it's not somewhere I feel the need to go back to.\n\nInstead, I recommend taking a multi-day Greek Island sailing trip that stops in Mykonos. That way, you can see it and experience some of the hype, but you don't have to stay for more than one night.\n\nGoing into my trip, I knew that Kos was more touristy than other islands I've visited. However, although it's beautiful, I ultimately found it to be underwhelming.\n\nInstead of unique gifts, I found that most of the old town was filled with typical tourist shops. The beaches were OK, but also seemed less picturesque compared to those I've visited on other islands.\n\nSince Kos has an international airport, I think it's best suited as a starting point for reaching other destinations.\n\nThis story was originally published on September 19, 2024, and most recently updated on February 23, 2026.",

    "fullText": "Peter Mandelson, the United Kingdom's former Ambassador to the United States, was arrested by the Metropolitan Police on Monday in the continued fallout over the Epstein files.\n\nThe police confirmed they had arrested a 72-year-old \"former government minister\" on suspicion of misconduct in public office, following search warrants at two addresses, including Camden. The description matches that of Mandelson.\n\nDocuments released by the Department of Justice in January showed Mandelson sharing sensitive government information with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nIn emails sent while Mandelson was a government minister, the politician forwarded internal memos to Epstein, tipping him off about changes in tax rules, the sale of government assets during the UK financial crisis, and the European Union's bailout of Greece's economy.\n\nThe documents also contain a record of Epstein sending money to Mandelson's husband, Reinaldo Avila da Silva.\n\nLast year, he was fired as ambassador after more about his ties to Epstein became public, and he subsequently left the British Labour Party.\n\nEarlier this month, the Metropolitan Police announced an investigation into Mandelson.\n\nMandelson has denied any illegal activity and told The Times of London that his husband's acceptance of funds from Epstein reflected \"a lapse in our collective judgment.\"\n\nLast week, King Charles' younger brother, the former Prince Andrew, was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office over government documents he shared with Epstein. The former prince, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, has denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe scandal around Mandelson has grown to affect Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has faced backlash for appointing Mandelson to the ambassador position in 2024, despite knowing about his ties to Epstein. Several of Starmer's senior staff members have quit over the revelations.",

    "title": "Why a veteran strategist says signs of stress among richer Americans mean it's a good time to buy stocks",
    "description": "The wealthy are becoming worried about the US economy more rapidly than lower-income households. A Wall Street veteran says it's that's bullish for stocks.",
    "fullText": "The S&P 500 could be set to break out of its anemic trading range, according to a veteran Wall Street strategist.\n\nThe key metric to watch isn't some piece of technical analysis or a big earnings update. Rather, it's the growing feeling of economic unease among high-earning Americans, according to Jim Paulsen.\n\nThe S&P 500 is roughly flat since the start of 2026 as investors weigh the market impact of Trump's uncertain tariff regime and AI disruption fears. Jim Paulsen, former chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group, says his new market indicator, which he dubs the poor/rich sentiment measure, has successfully forecast recent market rallies and is signaling a potential upswing is on the horizon.\n\nLower-income households were seen by forecasters as a weak spot in the economy for some time, but their mood has been brightening of late. At the same time, high earners have become more downbeat. This narrowing of the sentiment gap, Paulsen says, is a buy signal.\n\nPaulsen compares consumer confidence in the economy by income level to find a daily confidence ratio that he then combines with a ratio of Walmart's stock performance relative to the S&P Global Luxury stock price index.\n\nPaulsen overlaid his poor/rich sentiment indicator over the S&P 500 to assess it as an indicator for market performance.\n\n\"The Poor/Rich sentiment indicator has spiked higher 8 previous times since 2018 — in late-2018, October 2019, March 2020, May 2022, October 2022, November 2023, September 2024, and in April 2025. During each of these previous spikes in the Poor/Rich sentiment indicator, the S&P 500 was at a level which represented a good buy! \"\n\nSince the end of 2025, Paulsen's indicator has climbed. The measure's spike since December shares similarities with increases seen at the end of the 2022 bear market and at the 2020 pandemic lows.\n\nThe strategist ties the indicator's success to the idea that if the high-income cohort is losing faith in the economy, then the stock market is often at a low point. Paulsen highlights a downturn in Bloomberg's US billionaires relative total return index, which he says could be a signal that the rich are losing faith in the market.\n\n\"We seem to be in a relatively rare period when the Rich are losing confidence faster than the Poor … when the rich start complaining more than the poor, it's often been a good time to step up and buy some equities,\" the strategist said.\n\nPaulsen warned investors against using a single gauge, but said it may be a good time to assess equity exposure.\n\n\"If you are underinvested, perhaps it's worth considering taking advantage of recent volatility by adding to your equity exposure during selloffs,\" he wrote on his Substack post.",

    "description": "Over 9,000 flights have been canceled since Sunday as a snowstorm blankets the East Coast. FlightAware's Misery Map shows where chaos is piling up.",
    "fullText": "Even if you could make it to the airport as winter storm Hernando blankets runways and aircraft, your flight probably wasn't going anywhere.\n\nA \"misery map\" from the aviation-tracking website Flightaware shows where disruptions are piling up fastest. So far, more than 9,000 flights have been canceled across the US since Sunday. More disruptions are expected on Tuesday.\n\nCirium data shows that of the about 25,000 scheduled US flights on Monday, roughly 20% aren't taking off, compared with 1% on a typical day. It was about the same on Sunday.\n\nThe Northeast is bearing the brunt of the storm, with nearly every flight from Philadelphia to Boston canceled. More than half of the roughly 750 daily departures from Washington, DC-area airports have also been scrapped, mostly from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, the closest to the city.\n\nThe misery map doesn't currently show some smaller airports like Providence, Rhode Island, and Hartford, Connecticut, that have been similarly slammed by snow.\n\nThe disruptions — especially at busy hub airports — have caused a ripple effect across the national network, stranding travelers booked on subsequently canceled inbound planes far from home. This includes thousands of people on about 550 flights from abroad.\n\nWith only a handful of international flights per day, airlines may deploy additional planes to shuttle passengers back once the storm passes. Airlines made a similar call in January when people got stranded in the Caribbean amid a US raid on Venezuela.\n\nEven after the snow lets up, it could take airlines days to get back on schedule.\n\nAirport staff — many of whom may be stuck at home — may struggle to get to work quickly. Snow on the tarmacs, taxiways, and runways must be removed and full inspections completed before planes can safely land or take off. And aircraft must be de-iced and cleared of snow before each departure — processes that can take hours in heavy storms.\n\nTravelers shouldn't expect compensation for the chaos.\n\nAirlines classify the snowstorm as a \"force majeure\" event — situations outside their control that force flight delays, cancellations, or diversions. Travelers may receive a voucher for meals or hotel accommodations as a gesture of goodwill, but it's not required by federal law. Still, it doesn't hurt to ask.\n\nIf you booked your flight with a travel credit card, such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve or the American Express Platinum, you may be able to recoup expenses through their dedicated reimbursement programs.\n\nTravelers can get refunds for canceled flights (so long as they choose not to fly), and airlines are waiving change fees and fare differences as they suspend operations in certain airports. The changed flight must typically fall within a specific time window and be to and from the itinerary's original airports.\n\nIt has been a hectic 24 hours for air travel.\n\nAbout 40 Mexico‑bound flights were canceled or diverted on Sunday as carriers suspended operations to resort destinations amid cartel‑related unrest — adding to the logistical chaos already caused by the snowstorm.\n\nA confusing TSA PreCheck policy — which ended in the lanes remaining open, even after Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced they'd close amid the partial government shutdown — didn't help.",

    "fullText": "The US Navy abruptly fired the commander of guided-missile destroyer USS Truxtun after his ship collided with a logistics vessel during a resupply operation at sea earlier this month.\n\nRear Adm. Carlos Sardiello, who leads US Naval Forces Southern Command and 4th Fleet, relieved Cmdr. James Koffi on Sunday.\n\nThe ship collision that resulted in a \"loss of confidence\" and cost Koffi his command occurred during a replenishment-at-sea operation involving USNS Supply, a fast combat support ship, the Navy said in a statement on the relief.\n\nThe cause of the ship collision remains under investigation but highlights the risks of at-sea logistics and the challenges of keeping naval forces on the move.\n\nReplenishments-at-sea are resupplies in which one ship sails closely alongside another to transfer supplies such as fuel or ammunition. These missions are routine operations that support global naval activity by allowing vessels to remain at sea, rather than forcing them to return to port.\n\nAt-sea replenishments carry risks, though, that can be exacerbated by a range of factors beyond proximity, such as sea state, crew fatigue, communication breakdowns, and equipment failures.\n\nTwo personnel sustained minor injuries during the February 11 collision between the Truxton and Supply.\n\nKoffi, who took over the Truxtun just over a year ago, has been reassigned to Commander, Naval Surface Group Middle Atlantic. The Truxton, which had been deployed for under a month when the ship collision happened, is in port in Ponce, Puerto Rico. The Navy said the ship is undergoing repairs.\n\nCmdr. Taylor Auclair, who most recently served at US Fleet Forces Command, has been assigned to command the Truxtun.\n\n\"The Navy maintains the highest standards for leaders and holds them accountable when those standards are not met,\" the Navy said in a press release.\n\nA near-miss during a resupply in 2024 resulted in the relief of the commander of USS John S. McCain, another destroyer. And last year, the Navy relieved the captain of an aircraft carrier after it collided with a civilian merchant vessel during a deployment that experienced a string of major accidents, including the loss of three fighter jets, including one to a friendly-fire incident.\n\nThe Truxton deployed to Caribbean waters as part of President Donald Trump's pressure campaign against Venezuela and narcotics trafficking. The administration sent nearly a dozen warships, among other combat assets, to the region late last year. The military launched strikes on suspected drug-smuggling boats, seized oil tankers, and carried out a January raid inside Venezuela that resulted in the capture of its former president, Nicolás Maduro.\n\nMore recently, roughly a dozen Navy warships have been directed to the Middle East as the administration has shifted focus to a ballooning buildup in the region. As of last week, the Truxton is now one of just five ships remaining in the Caribbean",

    "fullText": "Newly captured satellite imagery shows widespread fires, roadblocks, and cars burning in a Costco parking lot after cartel violence rocked the Mexican resort town of Puerto Vallarta, the company that took the photos said.\n\nThe imagery, captured Sunday by US spatial intelligence firm Vantor and analyzed by Business Insider, underscores the scale of the chaos gripping Puerto Vallarta, nestled along the Pacific Ocean in Mexico's Jalisco state, and its hundreds of thousands of residents.\n\nFires and smoke can be seen across the city, including along a coastal road, in a Costco parking lot, at a shopping mall, and at an Autozone. Roadblocks are also visible in the imagery. Puerto Vallarta is a major tourist destination, especially in the winter.\n\nMexican forces carried out an operation Sunday that killed Nemesio \"El Mencho\" Oseguera Cervantes, the notorious leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel who had a $15 million US bounty on his head.\n\nPresident Donald Trump designated the cartel as a foreign terrorist organization just last year. Karoline Leavitt, a White House spokesperson, said the US provided intelligence support to Mexico to assist with the operation, although she did not specify how.\n\nThe Trump administration has made it a priority to combat Latin American cartels, encouraging heads of state to have a tougher stance against them and even using military force against alleged drug boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean Sea.\n\nThree additional cartel members were killed, three were wounded, and two more were arrested in the operation, which took place in Talpalpa, a town in the Jalisco state, Leavitt said. Mexico said three soldiers were hurt in the raid.\n\nRetaliatory violence erupted in cities across Mexico following the raid, with organized criminal groups and suspected cartel members clashing with security forces and setting fire to cars and buildings.\n\nThe US State Department urged American citizens in some locations to shelter in place and said most domestic and international flights were canceled in Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta, where scenes of the violence were shared widely on social media.\n\nDozens of suspected cartel members and security personnel have been killed in the violence, with Mexican authorities scrambling to regain control of the chaos.",

    "fullText": "Canary in the coal mine. The next financial crisis. \"Cockroaches\". Those are all phrases used in recent, panicked discussions of private credit, but according to Bank of America, commentary from the bears is creating a stream of misinformation that's to blame for the sector's recent troubles.\n\nThe Financial Times last week reported that Blue Owl, an alternative asset manager focused on private credit, froze withdrawals from one of its funds offered to retail investors, generating fresh concerns about the market and sparking comparisons to the financial crisis.\n\nEconomist Mohamed El-Erian said the situation could be a \"canary-in-the-coalmine\" moment akin to 2007, before the onset of the Great Financial Crisis. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he's \"concerned\" and watching the Blue Owl news. Adding to the troubles, Business Insider reported that Blue Owl was unable to finance a data center set to be occupied by CoreWeave.\n\nBlue Owl stock has fallen more than 16% in five days.\n\nYet, Bank of America analysts wrote on Monday that they're not worried about private credit, indicating they're surprised so many are. They say investors' worries are being driven by a lack of understanding about what private credit is.\n\n\"There is a significant level of misinformation weighing on OWL and the private credit industry which has led to a particularly attractive buying opportunity for OWL,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nBank of America's price target for Blue Owl stock implies a more than 100% upside.\n\nIt said there are a few reasons it remains upbeat on the sector. For one, BofA said that Blue Owl's data center exposure is separate from the rest of its private credit business. It also believes credit quality in the software sector is strong. Finally, last year's high-profile blowups of First Brands and Tricolor Holdings weren't precursors to a wider spate of private credit crises.\n\nBofA was bullish on the private credit space coming into 2026, and it remains upbeat in the long term.\n\n\"We continue to view private credit as an attractive contributor to a US retirees' portfolio given the high returns, downside protection and monthly dividends and it has even outperformed most equity strategies over the last three years,\" the bank wrote.",

I had to RUN to my Mac mini like I was defusing a bomb. pic.twitter.com/XAxyRwPJ5R\n\nYue had previously tried OpenClaw on her \"toy inbox,\" where she wrote that the bot worked well and gained her trust. Testing it on her \"real inbox,\" the bot had to compact a much larger set of emails. She instructed it not to take action without approval, but OpenClaw lost the prompt during compaction, she wrote.\n\nYue joined Meta after its deal with Scale AI as a director of alignment of its Superintelligence Labs division, according to her LinkedIn profile. That's left some critics on social media confused: why would someone studying AI safety use such an AI agent that has previously drawn security concerns?\n\nUnlike other AI agents, OpenClaw does not need human approval to sign off on actions. It was also vibe-coded, and that combined with OpenClaw's level of system access has led some AI researchers to question the bot's security. AI researcher Gary Marcus told Business Insider that it was like \"giving full access to your computer and all your passwords to a guy you met at a bar who says he can help you out.\"\n\nOpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger, who has since been hired by OpenAI, recently said in a podcast interview that he was prioritizing building out additional security safeguards over ease-of-use features.\n\nThough it's not altogether surprising that someone working in AI would test out one of the buzziest AI products of the last year, some X users criticized Yue for hooking up OpenClaw to her real email in the first place. Ben Hylak, the cofounder of Raindrop AI and an Apple alum, posted a screenshot of her LinkedIn. \"This should terrify you,\" he wrote. \"What is Meta doing?\"\n\n\"Somewhat concerning that a person whose job is AI alignment is surprised when an AI doesn't precisely follow verbal instructions,\" another X user wrote.\n\nYou can't make this up. And this happened to a someone working on safety and alignment at META Superintelligence Lab.\n\nI don't get how people can let AI agents go on unsupervised like this.\n\nI'll stick to my supervised use of AI for now. pic.twitter.com/tWvQFd1NP5\n\nYue and Meta didn't respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nYue also isn't the only Meta employee to toy around with OpenClaw; creator Peter Steinberger said that Mark Zuckerberg played with the tool for a week and even sent feedback. While Meta courted him, Steinberger later accepted a job offer from OpenAI.\n\nIn the comments of Yue's post, someone asked about her AI alignment role. \"Were you intentionally testing its guardrails or did you make a rookie mistake?\" they wrote.\n\n\"Rookie mistake tbh,\" Yue responded. \"Turns out alignment researchers aren't immune to misalignment.\"",

    "title": "David Ellison's Paramount has some breathing room in its quest to buy WBD despite a pressing deadline",
    "description": "Paramount is in a bidding war with Netflix for Warner Bros. and has until March to make its best and final offer.",
    "fullText": "Paramount Skydance is staring down a key deadline in its pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery, but it doesn't need to make a move quite yet.\n\nDavid Ellison and company have been able to negotiate directly with WBD's leadership team in recent days for the first time in months — thanks to Netflix, Paramount's rival in the bidding war.\n\nNetflix granted WBD, its deal partner, a weeklong waiver on negotiation exclusivity that expires at midnight on Monday. The company said it hoped these talks between Paramount and WBD would \"fully and finally resolve\" the monthslong saga that it said has been an \"ongoing distraction\" for both Netflix and WBD shareholders.\n\nAs of midday Monday, Paramount hasn't made its \"best and final\" bid for WBD, though it doesn't necessarily have to rush. That's because the seven-day window that Netflix granted Warner Bros. is to talk with Paramount, not the deadline for Paramount to raise its bid.\n\n\"Anyone can make an offer up to the shareholder vote,\" a person familiar with the WBD-Paramount negotiations told Business Insider.\n\nWBD's shareholder vote is on March 20. At that meeting, investors can choose to either approve or reject the Netflix deal, or they can abstain. WBD shareholders who prefer Paramount's offer can tender their shares to Ellison and company. Paramount has set a March 2 deadline for that, though it could be extended. If Paramount gets a majority of shares, it could shift WBD's course toward its own offer over Netflix's.\n\nThat means Paramount's real deadline for submitting its best offer is weeks away, though the company could raise its bid well before that. If Paramount raises its offer, Netflix will have four days to respond.\n\nWBD has said it prefers Netflix's all-cash offer of $27.75 per share for its studio and streaming assets over Paramount's proposal of $30 per share for the entire company, including its cable TV networks.\n\nWBD warned last week that if it went with Paramount, its employees could quit in droves, ahead of what could be a major round of layoffs under Ellison. Paramount has said it plans to create $6 billion in cost savings, which would include layoffs, compared to $2 billion or $3 billion from Netflix.\n\nParamount has argued that Netflix is the biggest threat to Hollywood since it has the most streaming subscribers and dominates viewership share among paid streamers. Netflix's counterargument is that it also competes against YouTube and other free streamers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is another variable. Trump said in December that Netflix's acquisition of Warner Bros. \"could be a problem\" due to its market share, before saying in early February that he had decided he \"shouldn't be involved\" in the regulatory process.\n\nA White House spokesperson told Business Insider last week that Trump \"has great relationships with all parties in this potential transaction and remains neutral in this process with no preference for either bidder.\"\n\nThen on Saturday, Trump said Netflix should remove Susan Rice from its board \"or pay the consequences.\" On a podcast, Rice, a former senior White House official under Obama and Biden, criticized the Trump administration and companies that \"take a knee\" under pressure from the president.\n\nNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos shrugged off the president's remarks on Monday, saying that the streaming titan's bid for Warner Bros. is \"not a political deal.\"",

    "description": "Anthropic's Claude is allegedly going to destroy  a bunch of jobs. Unless you look at the startup's job listings.",
    "fullText": "I've seen some silly predictions about the future of work lately. If you're worried about AI destroying jobs, take a quick trip through Anthropic's careers page. It's one of my favorite spots on the internet right now.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei is among the loudest voices warning that AI could erase many white-collar jobs. He's been especially outspoken about coding, given Anthropic's Claude Code is so powerful.\n\nA successful editor once told me to focus on what people and companies do, not what they say. So let's look at the jobs Anthropic is trying to fill right now.\n\nTop of the list: software engineering roles. The AI company with the most effective coding-automation machine on earth is looking to hire more than 100 coding experts.\n\nThis job posting stood out to me. Anthropic is hiring an iOS developer to build mobile apps. I thought you could just vibe-code apps these days? Apparently not.\n\nBoris Cherny, the creator of Claude Code, was asked about this recently. If this AI tool is writing most or all of Anthropic's code these days, why is the company still hiring so many software developers?\n\n\"Someone has to prompt the Claudes, talk to customers, coordinate with other teams, decide what to build next,\" Cherny replied on X. \"Engineering is changing and great engineers are more important than ever.\"\n\nLet that sink in. Software development is probably the job that is most disrupted by AI. Models have gotten good at coding because it's relatively easy to evaluate good versus bad outputs. That's because the code either works, or it doesn't, when deployed. This creates clear yes/no signals that are really valuable for training and fine-tuning new AI models.\n\nSo if Anthropic is still hiring more than 100 software engineers, then other types of jobs that are less impacted by AI should probably endure as well.\n\nProving my point, Anthropic has 32 finance jobs open, along with 33 in marketing, 16 in legal, and more than 100 in sales.\n\nI'm not just telling you this to make you feel better. When extreme AI job predictions are made, it leads to dumb ideas such as banning data center construction.\n\nSo, take a breath. AI is just a (powerful) tool to help humans get more work done. I'll leave you with final thoughts on this topic from Jensen Huang (who, by the way, is hiring humans like crazy).\n\nIn a recent interview, he argued that fears of mass job destruction often confuse the \"tasks\" involved in a job with the broader \"purpose\" of the role. AI, in his view, changes how tasks get done, but the purpose remains the same. And that means, the technology probably won't destroy jobs and could even increase demand for the people responsible for outcomes at work.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "\"These campaigns are growing in intensity and sophistication,\" Anthropic said as part of its lengthy statement.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic says its Chinese competitors are stealing from the AI startup to gain an edge in the global AI race.\n\nOn Monday, Anthropic said three of China's biggest AI labs, DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot AI, were \"illicitly\" using Claude \"to improve their own models,\" through a process known as distillation.\n\n\"These campaigns are growing in intensity and sophistication,\" Anthropic said as part of its lengthy statement on Monday. \"The window to act is narrow, and the threat extends beyond any single company or region. Addressing it will require rapid, coordinated action among industry players, policymakers, and the global AI community.\n\nAnthropic said the distillation efforts were \"industrial-scale campaigns\" that included roughly 24,000 fraudulent Claude accounts that generated over 16 million exchanges \"in violation of our terms of service and regional access restrictions.\"\n\nDistillation is the process of training a less powerful model on the output of a more powerful model. The practice is a legitimate way that many US companies use to train their models for public release. Increasingly, major US companies are also stating that their Chinese competitors are improperly using the practice to steal their work.\n\nIn January 2025, OpenAI said DeepSeek may have \"inappropriately\" used OpenAI's outputs to train their models. Earlier this month, Google disclosed it had \"identified an increase in model extraction attempts or 'distillation attacks.'\"\n\n\"Competitors can use it to acquire powerful capabilities from other labs in a fraction of the time, and at a fraction of the cost, that it would take to develop them independently,\" Anthropic said on Monday.\n\nAnthropic disclosed remarkable detail about the extent to which DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot AI \"illicitly\" used their systems. Claude is not available for commercial access in China, though Anthropic said the rival labs found workarounds.\n\nAmong the notable findings, Anthropic said DeepSeek sought to create \"censorship-safe alternatives to policy-sensitive queries.\" The company also said it detected MiniMax's campaign \"while it was still active,\" giving them an in-depth look at what their competitor was doing.\n\n\"When we released a new model during MiniMax's active campaign, they pivoted within 24 hours, redirecting nearly half their traffic to capture capabilities from our latest system,\" Anthropic said.\n\nRepresentatives for DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot AI did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nBeyond cheating in the AI, Anthropic said improper distillation poses security risks because less-trained models may lack the proper safeguards, such as those to prevent the development of bioweapons.\n\nIn response to such distillation campaigns, Anthropic said it has built in \"behavioral fingerprinting systems,\" shares data with other AI companies on what to look out for, and continues to develop additional countermeasures.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei recently wrote that leading models are approaching the point where, without proper safeguards, they could help direct someone in building a bioweapon.\n\nAmodei is also an outspoken advocate of US-export controls, a topic that divides some leading tech CEOs. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has repeatedly said that restricting US companies, including his own, from selling advanced chips to China won't curb China's AI advancements.\n\n\"Distillation attacks therefore reinforce the rationale for export controls: restricted chip access limits both direct model training and the scale of illicit distillation,\" Anthropic said.\n\nAnthropic has also faced allegations of using copyrighted material to train its models. In January, the Washington Post reported new details about an endeavor at the company called Project Panama, which the company reportedly described as \"our effort to destructively scan all the books in the world.\" Last year, Anthropic settled a class-action lawsuit brought by the authors and publishers of some of the books for $1.5 billion. As part of the settlement, the company didn't admit any wrongdoing.",

    "description": "222 wants to grow beyond helping people make new friends. The AI-powered startup also wants to help people find love and maintain relationships.",
    "fullText": "It'd be nice to meet someone the old-fashioned way: Passing by them on the street, meeting at a restaurant, or sharing an exchange at a party.\n\nHowever, apps dominate the modern dating experience, replacing kismet meet-cutes with scrolling and DMs.\n\n222, a startup focused on relationship building with the help of AI, thinks it can bring back the spontaneity of making a new friend — or falling in love.\n\n\"We're trying to get as close as possible to you walking into someplace with other people there, and connection just naturally happens,\" CEO Keyan Kazemian told Business Insider.\n\nAt a high level, 222 matches people with strangers for experiences like dinner or a night out after they take a robust personality quiz, using machine learning models trained by its team and open-source AI models.\n\n\"When you walk in, all of those people are people we predict you're going to be able to have a good conversation with, and you'll like,\" COO Danial Hashemi said.\n\nWhen 222 launched in 2021, it began as a dinner series in Los Angeles for young adults emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, helping them meet new people. Then the project grew into a company. It was accepted into Y Combinator, raised capital, moved to New York City, and launched a mobile app to spur in-real-life (IRL) socializing.\n\nWhile people who join 222 are often new to a city, Kazemian said, today they're pretty evenly split along why they're using the platform: they're either looking for new friends or potential romantic connections.\n\nSince putting out its app in 2024, the 222 experience has evolved. It's no longer just about meeting strangers, having a fun night, and forming new relationships.\n\n\"We're very focused on going beyond that,\" Kazemian said.\n\nThe platform is now digging deeper into connecting people after the first encounter that 222 initiates. It's helping plan follow-up hangs with friends and kindling a romantic connection by setting people up on a date if the feeling is mutual.\n\nAfter a 222 experience, the platform follows up to ask attendees whether they want to hang out or go on a date with anyone they met.\n\nOnce two people say they'd like to go on a date, \"we fully set up the next date for them,\" Hashemi said — reservation and all.\n\n\"If you think about just before dating apps, before all this stuff, how would people meet each other?\" Hashemi said. \"It would be you're in the same physical space with no preconceived notions of who this person is going to be.\"\n\nHashemi said that some of the \"joy\" of navigating how you feel about someone new in your life has \"gone away because of dating apps.\"\n\nMeeting in a way that feels more organic, such as a social gathering or through friends, has staying power. A 2025 survey of 7,000 US adults by health company Hims found that 77% of Gen Z met their partners IRL. Even Partiful, the Gen Z replacement for Facebook Events, is getting in on the IRL event-to-dating pipeline.\n\n222 thinks AI can make the meet-cute more accessible.\n\nWhat 222's founding team has zeroed in on is \"labeled data,\" Kazemian said, which comes from its users' feedback after they meet people.\n\nThe startup knows its first pairings may not be the ultimate match, which is why it encourages its subscribers — who pay $22 a month — to try multiple experiences. Its AI, in return, can curate better matches from 222's network.\n\nThere are layers of factors that contribute to that, 222's CTO Arman Roshannai said, such as similar music tastes or hometowns.\n\n\"The signal that we're training on is after you meet this person, you spend two hours getting dinner with them, and then you hang out for a few hours afterwards, were you guys actually a good match for each other?\" Roshannai added.\n\nKazemian added that training on this proprietary data from user feedback is a \"painstakingly difficult and long process,\" but gives the startup a \"technical moat\" to stand out from some competitors.\n\n222 isn't the only startup — or public company — betting that AI can improve how we connect.\n\nSeveral startups have launched with this premise and are raising millions, pitching matchmaking solutions that use AI to set people up. Meanwhile, Bumble, Tinder, and Facebook Dating are testing the AI waters and reimagining the swipe. Hinge's founder recently left the Match Group-owned dating app to build an AI dating alternative.\n\nAfter raising another $10.1 million from venture capital investors in 2025 — bringing the startup's total raised to $13.7 million — 222 is doubling down on hiring and expanding its product with tools that keep relationships going.\n\n222's next undertaking is to provide avenues for its users to reach their \"next offline moment\" together, so they can deepen those relationships.\n\nThe startup wants to be in the business of both creating relationships and maintaining them.\n\n\"They need to show up at the same place together,\" Kazemian said, be it a hangout, a date, or a restaurant reservation. \"We can help them figure out what that place is.\"",

    "description": "Branden James has spent the last 10 years flying to Puerto Vallarta for the winter with his husband. He says he is not afraid with what is happening.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Branden James, a 47-year-old musician who has spent the last 10 winters in Puerto Vallarta. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nYesterday morning, my husband and I were sitting in bed, looking out the windows, when we suddenly saw what looked like a fast-moving cloud across the sky. At first, I thought it was a rainstorm coming, but when I opened the window properly, I could see it was smoke — tons of it.\n\nWith the window open, we could hear explosions erupting into plumes of smoke across the beautiful, historic district of Puerto Vallarta.\n\nI was shocked. My husband and I have been to this city every year for 10 years during the winter months to perform as musicians. We've never experienced anything like this. This city has always felt safe.\n\nI opened Facebook to try and see if anyone in the local community groups knew what was going on. Everyone was piecing together that this must be retaliation after Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, Mexico's leader of the Jalisco New Generation drug cartel, was killed during a security operation to arrest him on Sunday.\n\nRealizing we didn't have much food in the apartment, we went to a friend's apartment on the eighth floor of our building to eat.\n\nWe all went to the rooftop of the building and could clearly see all kinds of activity unfolding below us. There were fires in shops. There were people being pulled from cars. We saw people going into buildings and throwing Molotov cocktails.\n\nIt was frightening to look outside and see so much burning in flames, but it was oddly comforting to see that civilians weren't being harmed.\n\nAs the smoke rose up to where we were standing on the rooftop, it started to feel unsafe to breathe in all the flames, which smelled of gas. As late afternoon rolled in, the smoke dissipated, and by evening, it had disappeared.\n\nAt around 5:30 p.m., a giant military chopper circled around us, which felt alarming for everyone looking on. The night was quiet, and we slept through the night without any disturbance.\n\nToday, we can see that people are starting to venture out to corner stores for food, but many shops are still shuttered. People here like to eat out daily, keeping only small amounts of food at home. I can see lines outside the open shops. We have eggs and smoothies, so we are trying to stay in for the most part.\n\nI can sense that people are rolling with how things are going. Flights have been canceled, but I've heard Airbnbs and hotels have been great about letting people stay longer.\n\nWhile I'm not fearful, I am sad. I'm sad for locals who survive on tourism. Americans have traditionally been scared about the safety of Mexico, and this justifies fears. But for so long, this has not been the case in Puerto Vallarta — it's always been incredibly safe. I'm sad about the impact that this disruption will have on locals' livelihoods and the impact on the reputation of the city I love so much.\n\nDespite these last two days, I still feel safer in Puerto Vallarta than I do in the United States, where I live for large parts of the year. In the US, there is so much more gun violence targeted at civilians.\n\nAs messed up as the drug cartel attack is, it is retaliation against the government, rather than against actual civilians here in the city. I haven't felt unsafe these last two days, because never once did I feel like the cartels were coming for us.\n\nWe are scheduled to be here until March 6th. We have three performances left — they may or may not get canceled. We'll most likely just stay here until our return date home, unless things get really dangerous.",

    "title": "Poor judgment or a principled stand? Susan Rice's spat with Trump dissected",
    "description": "Governance watchers say Susan Rice's critique of Donald Trump is complicating Netflix's bid for Warner Bros., while others call her stance principled.",
    "fullText": "A corporate board seat can bring status and stock awards — and also political heat.\n\nThe criticism that Netflix board member Susan Rice leveled at President Donald Trump last week is dividing governance watchers over how political a corporate director can afford to be.\n\nRice, who served in top roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, made several critical remarks about the commander in chief during an appearance on the podcast \"Stay Tuned with Preet Bharara.\" Trump responded by demanding that Netflix remove her from her seat \"or pay the consequences.\"\n\nThe spat has come at a precarious time for the video-streaming company. Netflix's pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery— an $82.7 billion bid — could reshape Hollywood, but it requires approval from the Department of Justice's antitrust division.\n\nWhile Rice's actions didn't break any laws, governance experts who spoke with Business Insider were split over whether she crossed a line.\n\nDirectors would be wise to keep their personal views about politics and other sensitive topics out of the public eye, said Charles Elson, founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. Their fiduciary responsibility is to serve in the company's best interests, and Rice's remarks ran counter to that duty, he said.\n\n\"It's poor judgment. And you're elected as a director for your judgment,\" Elson said. \"She has to ask herself, 'Am I a public figure or am I a corporate director?'\"\n\nElson, himself a director, said he avoids publicly staking out political positions. \"I just don't think it's in my lane,\" he said.\n\nTrump's threat of retaliation, however, didn't align with the kind of conduct normally expected of a sitting president, either, said Jo-Ellen Pozner, a management and entrepreneurship professor at Santa Clara University's Leavey School of Business.\n\n\"It's really important to recognize that what Susan Rice was calling out is exactly the behavior that Trump responded with,\" she said. \"Trump's reaction just points out how important what she has to say is.\"\n\nRice spoke critically of Trump at length on the podcast, suggesting her remarks were intentional rather than off the cuff.\n\n\"This might have felt like the hill that she was ready to die on, metaphorically,\" added Pozner. \"It's definitely risky for her politically. It's definitely risky for the Netflix deal, but it also seems like such a principled stance that it ought to be respected by most people.\"\n\nRice, Netflix, and the White House didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIt is possible that Rice warned Netflix's leadership about the podcast and got its blessing behind the scenes. Ted Sarandos, the company's co-CEO, referred to its bid for Warner Bros. as a \"business deal\" on the BBC's Today program on Monday. \"It's not a political deal,\" he said.\n\nStill, Rice's public and partisan tongue-lashing is unusual for a director on a major corporate board. It could make companies reconsider whether to put political figures on their boards, Elson said.\n\n\"Obviously, someone coming out of public service has a lot of experience, a lot of intelligence,\" said Elson. But, he added, \"Are you retired or not?\"\n\nThe incident could further discourage corporate leaders from speaking their minds in public, said Pozner. The president has repeatedly targeted critics, publicly calling for boycotts of companies and attacking business figures who challenge him.\n\n\"I think it will have a dampening effect on public speech,\" said Pozner.\n\nGovernance experts say the incident should serve as a case study for corporate boardrooms.\n\n\"Every company in America that has a pending regulatory approval should be watching the case,\" said Bradley Akubuiro, a partner at leadership advisory firm Bully Pulpit International.\n\n\"The lesson isn't: Don't have political opinions. The lesson is: Understand when your company is at peak vulnerability and govern that accordingly. … Time really does matter.\"\n\nCompanies may be able to prevent directors from causing a similar kerfuffle, said Akubuiro, by enacting quiet periods during sensitive moments. These would be similar to how leaders are expected to clam up in the weeks leading up to companies' quarterly earnings reports.\n\n\"You just want to recognize that in a politicized moment, anything that's quasi-political can become a weapon, and folks will use that against you for maximum leverage,\" Akubuiro said.\n\nSimilarly, companies need defined communication policies that set expectations for directors, especially when regulatory stakes are high, and outline what to do if a board member goes off script, said Jennifer Schielke, CEO of the staffing firm Summit Group Solutions.\n\n\"The boardroom should be designed for robust dissent that is productive and private,\" she said.\n\nIn a fractious political environment, it's prudent for board members to get counsel and to consider the potential costs and benefits of what they say, said Jill E. Fisch, a professor of business law at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nYet, she added, \"That is completely different from being cowed into not saying anything.\"\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, is a Netflix board member.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Brian Thompson, 75, who lives in New Jersey. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nOn February 21, my wife and I traveled to Puerto Vallarta, just in time to miss a historic blizzard hitting the Jersey Shore.\n\nWhen we were planning this trip, it seemed like a good idea to miss a couple of winter weeks by traveling to Puerto Vallarta, where I'd visited twice before.\n\nPeople describe Puerto Vallarta as a little bit of paradise. Locals and tourists here are very friendly. It's a vibrant, bustling city with a great jazz scene.\n\nI'd never felt unsafe here until yesterday. I woke up in the morning and saw what I thought was pollution from automobile exhaust, but when I went down to the front door of the condominium, people said we were under attack by the cartel.\n\nAt first, we stayed in our unit because we were told to shelter in place. I went up to the condominium's front door to see what was going on, but I didn't go any further. I spent the next few hours communicating with family and friends who wanted to know if we were OK.\n\nLater on, I went out onto the pool deck and could see new fires and smoke, and a helicopter circling. I saw multiple videos online of vehicles being burned in the area.\n\nThe scariest part was hearing that the restaurant adjoining our building was on fire. Fortunately, it was quickly put out, but I could see smoke coming across our balcony.\n\nThis morning, it looks like things have calmed down. My wife struggled to fall asleep last night. I've been worried about her, but I've only felt a little bit scared. For the most part, my adrenaline was high. I've spent my career as a television journalist, and I'm used to running toward trouble. I decided to report on the events to my audience by sending information to my friends and people on X.\n\nWe spent last night with some other residents in the condo, and they shared their food with us.\n\nWhen my wife and I arrived on Saturday, we didn't have much food with us. I'd brought three protein bars with me, and we'd gotten a few items from a local store, including chips, guacamole, and yogurt. I haven't tried to leave the condo yet today. Whether I will or not depends partly on whether my wife will let me.\n\nWe planned to travel to Mexico City after spending a week in Puerto Vallarta, but we've canceled that leg of our trip.\n\nSo far, it's been hard to get flights out of the area. The earliest trips I've been able to find are on this Friday and Saturday, and I've booked trips back to the US through both Houston and Los Angeles.\n\nI'm hoping New Jersey will have dug itself out from the blizzard by Friday, but I haven't booked our travel from Houston to New Jersey because I don't even know if we'll make it to Houston.\n\nI don't know if we'll come back to Puerto Vallarta, but I hope we will. I want to come back to support the people of Puerto Vallarta and show faith in their country.\n\nDo you have a story to share about being stuck on holiday in Mexico?

    "fullText": "The AI-driven software sell-off that ravaged markets in early February isn't over, with IBM stock tanking on Monday as Anthropic unveiled another disruptive AI tool.\n\nIBM shares fell 13% after the maker of the Claude AI chatbot announced another new tool. In this case, the startup announced an update that can help reduce the cost of COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) systems used by many businesses.\n\nThe term may not be widely known outside the software industry, but it quickly sent IBM stock into a nosedive in the latest installment of the software sell-off.\n\nAnthropic announced the update in a blog post, laying out why COBOL matters and why people outside the tech community should care.\n\n\"COBOL is everywhere. It handles an estimated 95% of ATM transactions in the US,\" it wrote. \"Hundreds of billions of lines of COBOL run in production every day, powering critical systems in finance, airlines, and government. Despite that, the number of people who understand it shrinks every year.\"\n\nAmong its uses, the company said the new tool could \"Identify risks that would take human analysts months to surface.\" The new AI use case poses a potential threat to the kind of business data service that comprises a core part of IBM's business.\n\nAccording to the startup, Claude will allow companies to streamline their COBOL operations for a fraction of their previous cost, similar to the legal plugins the company rolled out early in the month that triggered the initial software sell-off.\n\n\"Legacy code modernization stalled for years because understanding legacy code cost more than rewriting it. AI flips that equation,\" Anthropic said in its post.\n\nTech stocks initially bounced back after Anthropic's legal plugin release spooked Wall Street and caused investors to rush to limit their legal tech exposure, but the market was selling off sharply again on Monday.\n\nEven before the Anthropic news hit IBM shares, the sector was tumbling earlier in the session as investors reacted to tariff uncertainty and a report making the rounds online that speculated about far-reaching negative impacts of AI.",

    "description": "After cartel violence shut down flights and blocked roads in Puerto Vallarta, Americans are canceling vacations and rethinking future travel plans.",
    "fullText": "Hannah Donovan is four months pregnant. And with two little ones already at home, she and her husband had been banking on one family trip before life got even more hectic.\n\nPuerto Vallarta was meant to be a babymoon — a chance to meet up with family nearby, soak up the sun, and actually relax for a few days.\n\nHowever, less than 24 hours before they were set to head to their airport in Idaho, videos and pictures of burning cars and billowing smoke began circulating on social media.\n\nDonovan said the images she saw online followed reports that Mexican forces carried out an operation on Sunday in Tapalpa, Jalisco, that killed Nemesio \"El Mencho\" Oseguera Cervantes, the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. The incident sparked retaliatory violence across multiple cities in Mexico, including in Puerto Vallarta.\n\nThe Donovans have since canceled their trip to Mexico and will play it by ear on whether they'll try to visit Puerto Vallarta later.\n\n\"We're incredibly grateful we're not there, but we're worried about the people who are, including travelers and our family who live there,\" Donovan, 28, told Business Insider. \"We're definitely a little traumatized by the situation.\"\n\nThe Donovans are among many Americans rethinking trips, moves, and stays in the region after chaos flared across parts of Mexico following the killing of Oseguera Cervantes on Sunday. Four people at the scene were killed, according to authorities. Three others — including Oseguera Cervantes — were wounded and later died, and two people were arrested. Three members of the armed forces were also wounded.\n\nIt comes after President Donald Trump designated the cartel a foreign terrorist organization. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the US provided intelligence support for the operation, but stopped short of offering details on how. The administration has prioritized cracking down on Latin American cartels, urging leaders to take a harder line and deploying military force against suspected drug-smuggling vessels in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean.\n\nIn the hours since, the US and Canadian governments have urged citizens in some areas to shelter in place, and said most domestic and international flights in Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta were grounded. On Monday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum called for calm in the country, but many of those flights remained canceled.\n\nMexico has become increasingly popular with American tourists, drawn by its vibrant nightlife, strong culinary scene, and affordability compared to other trendy international destinations such as France and Japan.\n\n\"Americans, especially on the West Coast, have long used it as an inexpensive place to go on vacation,\" Robin Ingle, a specialist in travel security, told Business Insider.\n\nMexico has also seen a surge in tourism from people who previously would have traveled to the US but are avoiding the country for various political or financial reasons, he said.\n\n\"A lot of the people I've spoken to over the weekend would have gone to places like Florida, California, Arizona — now they're going to Mexico instead,\" he said of the tourists he's spoken to since cartel violence broke out.\n\nBut as unrest spreads, some Americans who had planned to vacation or relocate there, or who are already in Mexico, are watching those plans unravel.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with three of them about what comes next.\n\nDoug Howell, a retired sales and distribution executive from the Spokane, Washington area, bought a rental place in Puerto Vallarta and now spends roughly six months a year there — a routine he's kept up for the past 20 years.\n\n\"It's very vibrant,\" Howell, 63, told Business Insider. \"I like to walk around the neighborhoods, everything is pretty close, or a short bus ride away if you want to check out the beaches or the waterfalls. There's always something to do, and the food is incredible.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Howell said he was standing on his balcony when he started hearing explosions, then saw plumes of smoke rising nearby. Before long, he said, he noticed highways and roads in and out of the area had been blocked off.\n\nHe was scared at first, he said, and hunkered down with neighbors.\"We just stayed inside all day yesterday, and I didn't go anywhere,\" he recalled. \"They actually bombed a store on a corner and a car on the bridge that's not even a quarter of a mile away.\"\n\n\"They're already on it today, and people are supporting each other in the community — that's what I like about it,\" he said. \"One question everybody asks me: Is it safe? And it's like, yeah, it is, unless you go to the wrong place at the wrong time. And that's anywhere in the world.\"\n\nFor now, Howell plans to stay in Mexico, but if things worsen, he said he plans to return to the States.\n\nLinda Armijo and her husband have been visiting Puerto Vallarta for the past 25 years.\n\nIn January, they returned for a three-month stay in the city's Marina Vallarta district, an upscale, waterfront area in northern Puerto Vallarta.\n\nArmijo said that on Sunday, after her husband's massage therapist warned that roads downtown were blocked, she went up to the rooftop terrace of their condo, which overlooks the city. From there, she said she could see five or six plumes of smoke.\n\nSmoke isn't entirely unusual in Puerto Vallarta — controlled burns are common — but Armijo said this was more than she typically sees. \"I came down to our condo and told Anthony, 'There's something going on, there are fires everywhere,'\" she recalled.\n\nArmijo said the city was hit by a series of disruptions, including the blast of an engine as a car was set on fire, interruptions to water service, and highways and roads blocked off. Although the uncertainty has left tourists and locals scrambling, they're relying on each other to get by.\n\n\"I met two girls from LA who are renting a condo upstairs. They were meant to fly out yesterday, and threw away all their food and supplies before learning their flight was canceled. I shared some water with them,\" Armijo said. She added that a building worker told her they were also accommodating those who needed to extend their stay.\n\nArmijo plans to stay put for now and said she isn't especially worried about her safety. Instead, she's thinking about what this could mean for the city.\n\n\"I feel safe in my building, and we have plenty of food and water,\" the Spanish-speaker said. \"It's a minor inconvenience not being able to leave, but my biggest emotions are sadness and concern for the people of Puerto Vallarta.\"\n\nIn the near term, Ingle, the travel security specialist, said he expects to see an impact on the tourism scene.\n\n\"I know there's going to be a blowback in the next month, people deciding not to go, because there's a percentage of the population that doesn't want to take risks,\" he said. \"Governments are putting out warnings, and that affects travel insurance.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the long-term impact, however, Ingle doesn't see this weekend's violence creating a lasting stain on Puerto Vallarta's ability to attract tourists.\n\n\"If all the violence dies down quickly and gets cleaned up, I think this will go away,\" Ingle said. \"Normally, this will take a couple days, and then it will fix itself.\"\n\n\"That doesn't mean it's without risk,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "A crewed US Air Force fighter and an uncrewed jet-powered aircraft flew together recently, communicating and showing how autonomous drones might fight in a future air war alongside human pilots.\n\nUS defense firm General Atomics, a competitor in the Air Force's Collaborative Combat Program aimed at developing and fielding loyal wingman-type drones, said on Monday that its MQ-20 Avenger, long a CCA stand-in, flew with an F-22 Raptor.\n\nDuring the test at Edwards Air Force Base earlier this month, the stealth fighter's pilot commanded the test drone to carry out tactical maneuvers, perform combat air patrols, and execute airborne threat engagement tasks.\n\nThe most recent demonstration is an advancement of a similar test in November 2025, when an F-22 pilot used a tablet to control an MQ-20, a test aircraft being used to demonstrate CCA-style teaming. The tablet allowed the pilot to communicate with the drone and send commands during flight.\n\nThe flight test earlier this month saw the Raptor pilot use government-provided autonomy software on the F-22 and a tactical data link to pass commands in real time to the drone.\n\n\"This demo featured the integration of mission elements and the ability of autonomy to utilize onboard sensors to make independent decisions and execute commands from the F-22,\" David Alexander, the president of General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc., said in a statement.\n\nGeneral Atomics said the latest demonstration showed how CCA-type platforms could increase the combat power available to human pilots in a future war.\n\nThe Collaborative Combat Aircraft program is a priority for the Air Force as a way to bolster American airpower. These drones are meant to fly alongside advanced fighters, including the coming sixth-generation F-47 being developed by Boeing.\n\nAir Force officials say CCAs aren't disposable, but they're cheaper than fighters like the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter. They are built to be attritable so they can be risked in combat instead of a human-piloted aircraft.\n\nTesting with the MQ-20 is helping inform the Air Force's CCA program, which is focused on General Atomics' YFQ-42, Anduril's YFQ-44, and Northrop Grumman's YFQ-48A. The air service envisions these systems as easily upgradable platforms compatible with high-end crewed aircraft.\n\nCCA-type drones, which include designs beyond those with dedicated Air Force program designations, are designed to carry out missions on their own, from air-to-air combat to strike and intelligence roles, while also boosting the power of a formation by adding more sensors and weapons without another pilot in the cockpit.\n\nThe Air Force says that CCAs are not intended as replacements for its crewed jets but are rather partners that will change how pilots work with artificial intelligence and drones — and expand US airpower in a fight, especially against a near-peer adversary.",

    "description": "Lou Cohen emphasizes AI's potential in marketing, urging marketers to leverage it for improved audience segmentation and ad efficiency.",
    "fullText": "Lou Cohen, EY's chief digital officer, said many marketers are not yet taking advantage of the benefits of artificial intelligence.\n\nCohen, who is also a professor at New York University, Yeshiva University, and Baruch College, said marketing is at an \"inflection point,\" with investment shifting from general digital innovation to AI transformation.\n\nCohen said that marketers who understand how to use AI in an assistive way, by focusing on what outcomes it delivers best, will access a deeper level of audience segmenting, targeting, and testing. He was interviewed for CMO Insider at Business Insider's studio in New York City.\n\nUltimately, Cohen said, the marketing function will embrace the new opportunity. \"Marketers, they're not afraid to try things,\" Cohen said. \"We're going to learn more from the things that we fail with and that don't work than the things that do.\"\n\nThe following transcript has been edited for clarity.\n\nWe are at an interesting inflection point. In today's marketing environment, you really need to understand how to make AI work for you; otherwise, you will end up working for it.\n\nThere are efficiency and operational gains to be had. But if you think about the outcomes that AI can enable from a marketing perspective, we could be smarter about how we segment our audiences for different campaigns. We could be more efficient in the ways our advertising runs. We could test more rapidly to get better-quality content in front of the right audiences at the right time in the right place.\n\nBut most marketing teams are not yet set up to take advantage of this potential. So the investments of the last 15 years in digital transformation are now shifting into AI transformation.\n\nIt's a bit unknown now. Marketers are not totally comfortable with this because we're so worried that it's going to hallucinate or give us something that isn't accurate. Marketers, they're not afraid to try things. We're going to learn more from the things that we fail with and that don't work than from the things that do.\n\nMy colleague came up with a great way to evaluate the quality of our content using AI. We can paste in an article that a partner of ours wrote, and it will give us recommendations on how to make that piece of content better. But we're never — I shouldn't say never — we're not likely to use content created by AI. But we certainly can use AI to enhance and give feedback to our content creators.\n\nHallucinations are real. The challenge is that as consumers of these technologies, we don't yet understand the difference between probabilistic and deterministic outcomes. Probabilistic is the likely correct response that the AI is trying to give us. Deterministic is \"one plus one equals two,\" and arguably, one plus one always equals two. \n\nWhen you're doing a search on Google or Bing, for example, you are getting a deterministic response. You're getting what it believes to be the likely to answer your question. Versus with the LLMs, the ChatGPTs, the Llamas, the Geminis of the world, you're getting a probabilistic response. The model is bringing a bunch of different sources together to determine the answer it thinks you should get based on your prompt.\n\nThat means if we were using these tools for their designed purpose, we'd still need search engines to just navigate to the things we're looking for, or to find the needles in the haystack of the internet. But LLMs give us a different opportunity. They can be assistants. That was some of the original idea behind these AI tools, to assist people in doing different tasks.\n\nI think of these LLMs more as marketing assistants to give me real-time ideas, feedback, or suggestions, rather than doing the task for me. That's a human putting AI to work to get better outcomes faster than if I were to just do it myself.",

    "title": "The best travel purses to use as your personal item on flights, according to a travel writer",
    "description": "As a fashion-forward travel writer, I use a travel purse way more than a carry-on backpack. Here are the most stylish crossbody travel bags I tested.",
    "fullText": "I'll admit, I'm one of the reasons the airport security line is moving so slowly. Once I reach the TSA agent, even if I've rehearsed the interaction for last 30 minutes, I always end up rummaging furiously through my travel tote, where my plane reads, passport, and random lip balms have all mixed.\n\nFinally, I switched over to a designated travel purse. I've found it to be much more useful than a travel backpack because I can wear it throughout my whole trip, rather than just at the airport. The best travel purses I tested have better storage options for a passport, phone, keys, and wallet, offering convenient access in a cute, wearable little package.\n\nFor more on the best personal items we love to travel with, see our guide to the best weekender bags and best carry-on luggage.\n\nTo find the stylish travel purses for staying organized, I tested 10 bags and wore each for at least 5 hours. I wore them in crowded urban areas, on road trips, and through hiking trails. I took note of how heavy they felt and how long it took me to grab things when I needed them, particularly at cash registers and while going through customs. Our team of editors have tested dozens of other crossbody bags on international flights and backcountry road trips, the best of which we added below.\n\nThe genius zippered vertical side pocket keeps everything organized. I wore this medium-sized crossbody bag for errand-filled city excursions, beach days, and a weekend cabin getaway. No other purse I tested felt so well-suited to such a range of environments.\n\nThe interior pockets are helpfully mesh-lined so I could see where everything was the moment I opened the bag. It's hard for me to choose a favorite pocket — there are so many smart ones, including the built-in card holder. \"My favorite part is its vertical zippered side pocket, where I can pull out my phone without taking the bag off my shoulder,\" writes senior associate style editor Gabrielle Chase.\n\nIt's lightweight, buttery soft, and comfy to carry all day. In addition to looking high-end, the leather feels silky-smooth and gentle on my skin. Even when I had the bag stuffed to maximum capacity, the wide adjustable strap lands really comfortably and evenly, never digging into my shoulder or back. It only weighs 10.8 ounces, which is impressive given the amount of storage options.\n\nIt can convert into three different bags. The adjustable, removable strap clicks into the body of the bag, allowing you to wear the Aoyama as a shoulder bag or even a clutch. Having one beautiful, adaptable bag that keeps me organized from the airport to a fancy dinner saves space in my suitcase. This kind of versatility makes the $248 price tag a bit more justifiable. There's also a nylon version that costs $178.\n\nRead \n\nIt's low-maintenance and machine-washable. Made of a durable-feeling recycled nylon, the fabric isn't what you might call \"luxury\"—rather, it's sporty and lightweight, which is far more important to me when I'm lugging suitcases and spilling coffee. Best of all for a messy, outdoorsy traveler like myself is that this Baggu is machine-washable.\n\nThe storage is simple and roomy. The Cargo Crossbody doesn't have as many specialized compartments as the other options I tested. Instead, there's just two exterior pockets and one interior zippered pocket. But the fact that the roomy interior is open gives me the option for all the other stuff I inevitably acquire while traveling. It can comfortably fit a wallet, sandwich, can of Diet Coke, a Nintendo switch, phone and a book, as I learned from my picnic in the park.\n\nIt comes in a variety of cute colors. Mine is a French blue, which adds a fun pop of color to any outfit (just because a bag is utilitarian and practical doesn't mean it has to be plain).\n\nI no longer have to root around in my bag for my phone. Before Bandolier, I'd yet to find an accessory that offers easy, fumble-free, repeated access to my phone, which I use constantly while traveling — checking reservations, looking at Google Maps, or filming my pasta like I'm an influencer.\n\nBandolier's sturdy leather phone case, which has a handy envelope for cards, upgraded my entire life. I can wearing my phone elegantly as a purse, with the crossbody strap clasped directly to the leather phone case. This made it so easy to grab and then \"put away,\" i.e. drop so it simply drapes across my body. The case clasps easily into Bandolier's expanded pouch, which can fit tickets, a thin wallet, a passport, keys, and a lip balm.\n\nThe materials and design feel expensive. Also, it is expensive. Both made of 100% leather, the Expanded Pouch is $98, and the Lily Duet (which is crossbody and wristlet phone case duo) costs $148. The sturdy pouch is a nice addition for a bit of extra storage, but you don't necessarily need to buy both: the phone case and detachable strap are enough.\n\nThe phone case itself is amazing. The back pocket card holder has a snap closure that keeps my credit card and ID secure and hidden. It's much safer than the exposed card holders I had before. I've made this my permanent phone case, whether traveling or not.\n\nThere are so many security features. The locking clasp straps are secure — they even take me a moment to undo when I'm just alone in my house, so I can't imagine how a thief would pull it off. I wore this bag through Times Square to get to a gynecologist appointment, and not for a second did I fear for the precious contents inside it (which included my anti-anxiety meds). Arden Cove makes it with \"slash-resistant lining\" and a hidden back zip pocket where I put my passport.\n\nIt can be worn in four ways. This Bum Bag's adjustable straps let me wear it as a belt bag, fanny pack, chest bag, or crossbody, which is ideal for crowded, high-traffic areas when I want my belongings as close to me as possible. The structure of the bag itself is less flexible than other options, but it allows you to keep everything close to the chest.\n\nThe storage is elite. I'm obsessed with its storage options, which includes two card holders that are perfect for subway cards, business cards, credit cards, IDs, and small tickets.\n\nIt's really comfortable. Away's simple design offers just the right amount of structure and slouch. It's made from a water-repellant polyester till feels cushiony and almost quilted. Even when I filled the bag with snacks, a big book, a Fuji camera, and my notebook, the padding around the strap prevented the bag from digging into my shoulders.\n\nIt has an impressive capacity. The Featherlight Crossbody weighs just over half a pound, yet has a storage capacity of 10 liters. I wore the bag on a bike trail along the Hudson River, to a Phillies game, and to Brighton Beach, where water and sand slid right off. It's also machine washable.\n\nThere are super useful hidden exterior pockets. I used the tiny one on the strap, which is perfect for AirPods or keys, and the other that's ideally sized for a passport and phone. These helped me avoid rummaging around in my bag in front of hotel receptionists and baristas.\n\nThere are so many ways to store things. I especially loved the convenience of the exterior magnetic-closure phone pocket. It has special compartments like card slots and pen loops, with loads of interior and exterior pockets for easy access to everyday items. I found myself constantly using the little loops for pens — a Godsend as mine are always scribbling on the bottom of my bags.\n\nIt looks cool. The Micah crossbody has a really distinctive, athletic look, with fun, chunky zippers. I felt really cool wearing it to yoga class and to the dog park. The 100% vegan material is made from 7 recycled plastic bottles, and it feels durable and sturdy.\n\nIt's lightweight and comfortable. It's can easily fit all the items I want while traveling — like documents, tablets, pens, books, and large headphones — but not something as large as a water bottle (for that, we suggest Dagne Dover's Sloan Sling instead).\n\nIt has a slim profile with a deceptively spacious main compartment. \"I toted it for a long day in New York City, and I appreciated that all my items were secured, but I knew exactly where to find them when I needed to,\" writes style contributor Talia Ergas.\n\nThere are eight pockets total, \"with organizational features galore designed with neat freaks like me in mind,\" says Talia. \"On the exterior, it has a front U-shaped pocket that offers a perfect compartment for stowing my cash and credit cards (in the leather card pocket), keys (via an easy access key leash), a pen (which stays secure thanks to a leather pen loop), and other quick-access items like a passport or tickets.\"\n\nIts lightweight design packs flat. Say you're wearing a backpack on the plane, but still want your Tumi Tyler Crossbody once you reach your destination. You can simply empty out the contents and the water resistant nylon exterior won't crumple, even if you have to smoosh it beneath the rest of your belongings.\n\nIt makes a trendy handbag into a practical purse. East-West bags — the long, skinny silhouette popularized by Alaia's $2,950 Le Teckel — can be horribly impractical. The slim body might be the trendiest shape right now, but I can't imagine squeezing travel essentials like sunscreen or snacks into a purse built like a pencil case. But the Gabrielle Shoulder Bag from Parisa Wang makes this purse trend practical. Not only is it supremely roomy, but it also has lots of functional features like quick-access pockets and handles that feel comfortable enough on your shoulder for all-day wear.\n\nThe elongated shape makes the purse incredibly spacious. I fit a hard-shell sunglass case, a 3.4-ounce bottle of sunscreen, a granola bar, a wallet, a pack of Band-Aids, two lipsticks, a claw clip, and all my little essentials like keys and AirPods in the purse with lots of room to spare. It also has two exterior pockets on either side of the bag, which are perfect for storing quick-access items like tickets or travel documents.\n\nIt works from day trips to dinner reservations. Lots of practical purses tend to lean too heavily into function at the cost of form. But this bag, with its smooth leather and minimalist look, would be chic enough for a stop at a Parisian wine bar after your walking tour. We all know the look of a tourist with their many-pocketed fanny pack, but this purse won't make you look like you came straight from a survivalist retreat. — Samantha Crozier, style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nMaria Yagoda, travel writer and style contributor: Maria is based in Brooklyn, where she covers travel and culture. It's where these two fields intersect that she's witnessed the latest style trends from across the globe. Whether she's flying to Italy or venturing upstate, Maria is intuiting which travel accessories are a worthy investment for most people in terms of convenience, comfort, and aesthetics.\n\nLearn how the Reviews team tests clothing, shoes, and accessories at Business Insider.\n\nStorage capacity: You want a travel purse that's small enough to not add bulk, but still has room inside for an umbrella, book, or souvenirs you pick up along the way. I found the ideal liter capacity for travel purses to be around 10 liters.\n\nSecurity features: Look for RFID-blocking compartments to protect your credit cards, and zippered closures. Crossbody bags offer a more secure fit that's harder to swipe off your person.\n\nWeight and adaptability: The more lightweight a travel purse is — and the more ways you can adjust its wide strap to distribute the weight — the more comfortable you'll be throughout your trip. Look for travel purses that weigh between 8 to 10 ounces.\n\nDurability: Look for machine washable, water-resistant materials (like nylon) especially if you'll be doing outdoorsy stuff.\n\nCompartments: Look for travel purses with horizontal and vertical zippered pockets on its interior, exterior, or even carrying strap.\n\nKAAI Rebel Crossbody ($575) This sporty, luxury-grade sling bag has a cool asymmetrical shape and is lined with a beautiful blue suede. Unfortunately it was too narrow and structured to fit anything bulky.\n\nQuince Italian Leather Convertible Crescent Shoulder Bag ($119) This is a well-made Italian leather purse that looks a lot like the very trendy Clare V. Moyen Messenger ($435). It's comfortable to wear, but the internal organization is somewhat minimal.\n\nCuyana Mini Paloma Bag ($398) It's elegant, compact, and has good organizational features, but was just a bit too small for my everyday carry. This one's better suited to minimalist travelers.\n\nCaraa Nimbus ($190) Design-wise, this bag has a very distinctive, cool look. It's kind of fluffy and cloud-like, so it could be used as a travel pillow if you're desperate. The storage space is really flexible and can accommodate quite a lot, but it only has three interior pockets.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

    "fullText": "The roar of Lamborghini's screaming V10 and V12 engines won't go silent.\n\nIn an interview with The Sunday Times, CEO Stephan Winkelmann said the Italian supercar maker has scrapped plans for its first all-electric model, the Lanzador, after consumer interest in high-priced EVs flattened to \"close to zero.\"\n\n\"EVs, in their current form, struggle to deliver this specific emotional connection,\" he told the Times, adding that engine noise is often a selling point for luxury sports cars. \"The decision was made after over a year of continuous internal discussion, engaging with customers, dealers, market analysis, and global data.\"\n\nLamborghini first announced the Lanzador EV in 2023, and the high-riding two-door coupe was scheduled to hit dealerships by 2029.\n\nWinkelmann said the car will now come to market as a plug-in hybrid instead.\n\nThe shift marks a notable recalibration for the Volkswagen-owned supercar brand. In 2021, Lamborghini laid out an electrification road map that was supposed to add a fully-electric car by the \"second half of the decade.\" The company said it wanted to cut its 2024 carbon emissions in half.\n\nWinkelmann told the Times that by 2030, its entire lineup will feature a gas engine and a battery that can be plugged into an electrical outlet.\n\nHe added that it will continue building internal combustion engines \"for as long as possible.\"\n\n\"Lamborghini is fully prepared for full electric,\" the company said in a statement to Business Insider. \"However, market readiness within the segment is not yet aligned with this transition.\"",

    "title": "AI-Generated Playlists, a New Look, and Other Changes Coming to Apple Music",
    "description": "The next big iPhone update will bring new features to the Apple Music app.",
    "fullText": "Your iPhone is likely currently running iOS 26.3 (assuming you've been keeping up with the operating system updates), but there's another version currently in the works over at Apple HQ. Right now, beta testers have their hands on iOS 26.4, which is shaping up to be a much bigger update than the last. Among the changes, Apple is debuting end-to-end encryption for RCS chats, so texts with Android users will no longer be insecure, and the Reminders app is getting an \"Urgent\" section for any entries you've labeled as such.\n\nBut perhaps no part of iOS is getting a larger update with 26.4 than Apple Music—both the app, and Apple's paid subscription service. Apple seems to have decided that Music needed a bit of a facelift, as well as some quality of life changes that will make the app and service easier to use. Whether you use Apple Music for streaming or you rely on it to store your digital library, you're going to notice the updates when iOS 26.4 drops in the near future. Some of these features will be free and some only available to paid subscribers; I've reached out to Apple to confirm which is which, and I will update this piece if I hear back.\n\nDo you like making playlists, or do you know someone who does? The robots are coming for your hobby, too. With iOS 26.4, Apple Music is rolling out \"Playlist Playground,\" a new feature that lets you generate playlists from natural language prompts. In layman's terms, that means you tell the AI what kind of music you want to hear, and it will generate a playlist from that request. That could something hyper-specific, like \"Taylor Swift country tracks,\" or something more general, like \"morning coffee vibes.\" The AI will choose 25 songs it thinks match your query. If it doesn't get it quite right, you can ask it to make changes, and you can change things yourself, like the playlist's title, description, and cover image.\n\nI'm interested to try this out, if for no other reason than music discovery: I like Apple Music's curated playlists already, but I am intrigued as to whether asking Apple's AI to select certain types of songs for me will help me find new music any better than the platform's human curators. I also don't think this will stop me from making my own playlists, or looking for playlists from friends. Sure, maybe the AI is good at picking 25 songs that match a specific theme, but there is an art to hand-picking tracks that work well together—plus, it's just fun.\n\nApple is far from the first company to roll out such a feature. YouTube Music recently launched something similar, while Spotify has two different AI playlist features (AI Playlist and Prompted Playlist) available on its platform.\n\nWhen you start exploring Apple Music after updating to iOS 26.4, you'll likely notice something right away: The UX, which is normally white or black (whether your iPhone is in light or dark mode) now matches the color scheme of the artwork for the album or playlist you're checking out. The effect is especially cool when the album art supports full-screen motion, like the following:\n\nApple has made some divisive design decisions in recent years, but I think this change is going to be a crowd pleaser. The difference between the current design on iOS 26.3 and the new look is stark, and, while there's nothing wrong with how things stand now, it already looks super dated next to the full-screen color matching designs.\n\nSpeaking of playlists, you can now add songs to multiple at once—just in case you still need some human intervention when it comes to these playlists. When you go to add a song to a playlist, you'll notice a new button in the bottom right. Tap it, and Apple Music opens up the ability to select multiple playlists at once, and send the song to all of them. It's a small change, but a helpful one, especially if you frequently add new music to more than one playlist at a time. I could see myself using this to add a song to my personal new discoveries playlist, as well as a shared playlist of new music I keep with friends.\n\nNot all music is made to active listening. If you use Apple Music for background music, especially when sleeping, working, or zoning out, you might be interested in the new \"Ambient Music\" widget, which lets you launch one of four different ambient playlists from the Home Screen: Sleep, which plays \"Sleep Sounds;\" Chill, which plays \"Today's Chill;\" Productivity, which plays \"Productivity;\" or Wellbeing, which plays \"Pure Meditation.\"\n\nI still can't quite shake the habit of relying on YouTube for my \"focus music\" needs, especially since these tracks mess with my Apple Music algorithms. But it might make sense to start relying on the platform I actually pay for when I want music to work or fall asleep to—unless that music is only available elsewhere.\n\nApple Music is also making it easier to listen to music outside of the app. The platform is rolling out a \"Concerts Near You\" section, which shows you artists playing in your area. You can see popular artists and their concert dates, as well as shows that are coming up this week. You can sort by both date and genre, and you can update the location when you want to know where shows are going to be in different areas.",

    "title": "Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2026: How to Watch and What to Expect",
    "description": "The next Galaxy S Series is nearly here.",
    "fullText": "Whether you're a Samsung fan, an Android user, or just a tech enthusiast in general, you may want to clear your calendar: Samsung Unpacked 2026 is nearly here. Like Google I/O or Apple's fall event, Unpacked is Samsung's keynote, where the company shows off what it's been working on since, well, the last Unpacked. Like previous keynotes, this year's should be full of big Samsung news, all of which you can watch live as it happens.\n\nSamsung's big presentation will kick off in San Francisco on Wednesday, Feb. 25. Like many tech events, Galaxy Unpacked starts at 10 a.m. PT (1 p.m. ET).\n\nWhile Samsung is hosting a live presentation for a limited number of media and guests, anybody can tune into Galaxy Unpacked 2026 as it happens. The company is streaming the show from a number of websites, including Samsung.com, Samsung Newsroom, and Samsung's official YouTube channel. The YouTube livestream is currently up, but, of course, you won't see much until 1 p.m. ET on Wednesday.\n\nUsually, all we have is rumors and conjecture when reporting on what a company like Samsung will reveal during a big hardware event. We still need to do that in this case, but, that said, the company outright told us what its biggest announcement will be. When Samsung first announced Unpacked 2026 a couple weeks ago, it said that \"the new Galaxy S series is coming,\" which, no doubt, refers to the Galaxy S26. Samsung says this new series is \"built to simplify everyday interactions, inspire confidence, and make Galaxy AI feel seamlessly integrated from the moment it's in hand.\" Whatever that means.\n\nWe can look to rumors surrounding the S26 series to paint a picture of what to expect Wednesday. As it the norm, Samsung will likely release three main S26 units: the S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. It isn't clear whether the company will release an S26 Edge this year to follow up the S25 Edge.\n\nThe standard S26 seems like it'll be a small upgrade over the current S25, though with one key change: The new Galaxy will house its three rear cameras on a raised camera bump, following in the footsteps of Apple and Google. Rumors are split as to whether the cameras themselves will be upgraded, with some speculating that the Ultra will jump from 12MP to 50MP. The S26 may pack a 6.3-inch AMOLED display, a 4,300 mAh battery, up to 12GB of RAM, and possible up to 512GB of storage. Samsung may be running with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 to power the phone. The S26 Plus will likely be a similar phone, just with a larger 6.7-inch display.\n\nThe S26 Ultra looks like it'll launch with four rear cameras, with three of them contained to the bump out. As usual, the Ultra is the largest of the bunch, sporting a rumored 6.9-inch display. It could even be a bit thinner than the current S25 Ultra. The cameras may get some upgrades too, though the raw numbers appear to the same as the S25 Ultra. For example, while both may have 200MP main sensors, the S26's sensor may get some upgrades. It, too, could come with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip, as well as up to 16GB of RAM, up to 1TB of storage, a 5,000 mAh battery, and 60-watt fast wired charging.\n\nThe entire S25 series may also support 25W fast wireless charing, and may start selling a 25W Qi2 charger that supports it. They may all also support satellite communications, which would let users call and text emergency services and contacts without cellular network—similar to Apple's Emergency SOS via satellite on iPhone.\n\nSamsung will likely unveiled a new pair of earbuds Wednesday alongside the S26 series: Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 Pro. If the rumors are true, the Buds 4 will come in black and the Buds 4 Pro will come in white, though both will come with a charging case with a transparent lid. Besides color, the other big difference here is how the buds fit: The Buds 4 Pro are rumored to come with silicone tips, like AirPods Pro, while the Buds 4 do not, like Apple's standard AirPods.\n\nFinally, expect some big AI announcements, especially as they pertain to the S26 series. In a press release on Sunday, Samsung announced an \"expansion of Galaxy AI\" to support \"a choice of integrated agents.\" Specifically, Samsung is partnering with Perplexity to bring its AI agents to Galaxy devices. You'll be able to say \"Hey Plex\" to access the agent, and the bot will work across Samsung apps, like Calendar, Clock, Gallery, Notes, and Reminder.\n\nAt the same time, the company is currently testing the latest version of its own assistant, Bixby, with One UI 8.5. The goal is to let users ask Bixby for things on their Galaxy device, such as \"I don't want the screen to shut off when I'm looking at it,\" and the bot will adjust the proper settings in kind. The new Bixby can also access the web to answer questions, similar to other AI bots like ChatGPT or Gemini. Expect to hear more about this during Unpacked as well.",

    "description": "British number one Jack Draper marks his post-injury return to action on the ATP Tour with a straight-set win over Frenchman Quentin Halys at the Dubai Tennis Championships.",
    "fullText": "British number one Jack Draper said he felt \"really proud\" after marking his post-injury return to action on the ATP Tour with a straight-set victory over Frenchman Quentin Halys in Dubai.\n\nCompeting on the men's tour for the first time since the US Open last August, Draper won 7-6 (10-8) 6-3 on his debut at the Dubai Tennis Championships.\n\nThe 24-year-old, who has slipped to 15th in the world after reaching a career-high ranking of fourth in June, will play Hungary's Fabian Marozsan or France's Arthur Rinderknech next.\n\n\"I've been craving the feeling of competing for a very long time,\" Draper said in his post-match interview.\n\n\"It just felt normal, it felt like I was coming back to doing what I love, which is being out here, competing and having the adrenaline of winning and losing points.\n\n\"A lot of people have helped me to get back to this position after a lot of down moments [during] the last eight months.\n\n\"It's not been easy to be back here and that's something I can be really proud of. Long may it continue.\"\n\nDraper contested his first competitive match for 164 days when he played at the Davis Cup qualifiers earlier in February, beating Norway's Viktor Durasovic in straight sets.\n\nBut he had remained absent from tour singles competition since withdrawing from the US Open before his second-round match because of a left arm injury six months ago.\n\nDraper won the prestigious Masters 1,000 title at Indian Wells and reached the fourth round of the Australian and French Opens in a promising start to his 2025 season.\n\nBut he began struggling with a bruised bone in his service arm during the clay-court swing in April, and the issue progressively worsened.\n\nDetermined to complete a full recovery from the issue, Draper took the decision to miss the Australian Open in January before making his return for Great Britain on 5 February.\n\nSeeded fourth in Dubai, Draper had to withstand a set point when serving at 5-4 down in the opening set but went on to edge a tight tie-break by winning three consecutive points to overcome an 8-7 deficit.\n\nDespite first-set opportunities for both players, the first break of serve in the contest did not arrive until the fourth game of the second set when the 68th-ranked Halys hit wide to give Draper a 3-1 lead.\n\nDraper served out victory untroubled from there, conceding just two further points on serve as he ending the match with an impressive 86% win rate on his first serve.\n\nThe left-hander's successful recovery from injury was also underlined by the fact 19 of his 24 winners flew off his previously affected forehand side.\n\nThe post-victory celebration might have been reserved - a solemn face only briefly breaking into half a smile - but Draper will be delighted with his ATP Tour return, make no mistake.\n\nAn absence of nearly six months has undoubtedly been difficult for Draper to deal with.\n\nPulling out of January's Australian Open showed the severity of the bruised humerus on his dominant left arm - the bone running from the shoulder to the elbow - and the necessity to avoid any risks.\n\nSo too did the decision to withdraw from the ATP tournament in Rotterdam earlier this month.\n\nSome saw that move, coming after making his comeback with a routine Davis Cup win, as a red flag.\n\nFor Draper, though, it was all about playing the long game with a career which has been characterised by injury.\n\nBut there was no holding back against Halys. A pair of flaying forehands in the first two points of the match set the tone, followed by a booming ace at the start of an opening service game where he found his range with four out of five first serves.\n\nDraper was wearing a protective compression sleeve on the affected arm, but he continued to play freely and fluently from the baseline.\n\nIt has been clear for a while there is not a straightforward fix with an injury of this nature.\n\nGenerally speaking, the fear with a bruised humerus is the problem could lead to a more serious stress fracture with continued repetition and torsional stress - which tennis players clearly face.\n\nPatience has become a virtue which Draper has needed to learn - and, while this was an impressive return, he may still need more of it in the weeks and months ahead.\n\nLive scores, results and order of play\n\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Striker Benjamin Sesko and goalkeeper Senne Lammens are the key figures as Manchester United gain a hugely valuable Premier League win at Everton.",
    "fullText": "Michael Carrick had a neat way of describing Benjamin Sesko's assimilation into life at Manchester United.\n\n\"He is growing as a player,\" said United's head coach. \"Sometimes it's big steps, sometimes it's little steps. He has taken some huge ones recently.\n\n\"The confidence and belief he is playing with is great to see.\"\n\nThe mighty strides Sesko has taken in United's latest two games have placed the club in a superb position to cement a return to the Champions League after a two-year absence.\n\nWithout the Slovenian's contributions off the bench, United would have lost at West Ham on 10 February and drawn with Everton on Monday on their first visit to Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\nSesko's goals have put Carrick's men out on their own in fourth spot, three points behind Aston Villa and three ahead of Chelsea and Liverpool.\n\nIf his stoppage-time volley to earn a point at West Ham was a thing of aesthetic beauty, his latest effort in the 71st minute of the 1-0 win at Everton was a feat of physical excellence.\n\nIt was a combination of endurance, running 70 yards at top speed after laying off a pass to Matheus Cunha, and calmness, to steady himself and coolly slot home Bryan Mbeumo's square pass.\n\n\"It was a great finish, a ruthless finish,\" said Carrick. \"I like the way he put it away with real confidence.\"\n\nWatching the game for Sky Sports, former Liverpool and England defender Jamie Carragher looked at the goal admiringly.\n\n\"Sesko has gone over 80 yards and then finishes,\" Carragher said. \"You expect him to be breathing heavily and panting after that. But no, he still has the energy to really celebrate.\"\n\nSesko has taken his goals tally to eight for the season.\n\nRemarkably, he only scored twice under Ruben Amorim, who signed him from RB Leipzig for £73.7m in August 2025.\n\nNow he has six in his latest seven games, starting with three in two matches while Darren Fletcher was in interim charge after Amorim's dismissal at the start of January.\n\nThat return has led many observers to feel Sesko is unlucky not to have made the starting XI for any of the six games Carrick has had at the helm.\n\nUnited's boss understands the debate. But he doesn't feel it is especially important.\n\n\"I get why everyone is talking about it and making a big deal of it, but it is not always as extreme,\" he said.\n\n\"I have got a really good relationship with Ben. We have had some good conversations, and he is in a good place.\n\n\"He obviously wants to play, but we have got some good forwards and I can't speak highly enough of how he has been.\"\n\nFor Sesko, it is about delivering when his manager asks – and he is brimming with the confidence to do that.\n\n\"I believe in me and so do the other players,\" Sesko told Sky Sports.\n\n\"They know what they are going to get when I arrive in the game. Whether that is five minutes or 90 minutes, it doesn't really matter. It's about showing I can deliver if I possibly can and I'm really happy with that.\"\n\nSesko comes off bench to score Man Utd winner at Everton\n\n'I'm not Schmeichel in disguise - I am just Senne Lammens'\n\nWho has made Troy's Premier League team of the week?\n\nIf Sesko broke Everton's hearts at one end of the field, another summer recruit, Senne Lammens, did it at the other.\n\nThe Belgian goalkeeper kept out a blockbuster strike from Michael Keane, which Moyes felt sure was going in, then dealt superbly with a series of corners dropped under his crossbar as Everton literally tried to force an equaliser.\n\n\"Their goalie was brilliant tonight,\" was Moyes' blunt reaction.\n\n\"The save he made from Michael, the way he dealt with corner kicks. The pressure we had. For me, their goalkeeper was the best player.\"\n\nCarrick is the one who benefits though, just as he is benefiting from the decision of United's recruitment department to block Amorim's calls to bring in Emi Martinez from Aston Villa on summer transfer deadline day and instead place their faith in a relatively young £18.1m goalkeeper with just one full season of senior football in Belgium behind him.\n\nLammens is 23. Sesko is 22. United might not quite be winning trophies with kids, but they have a young generation that is beginning to blossom.\n\nIt was brought to Carrick's attention after the Everton game that his former United team-mate and all-time great goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar was analysing the game on TV with Carragher.\n\nCarrick skilfully navigated the question of whether there are comparisons to be drawn between the two men.\n\n\"I've got to be careful what I say,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't want to be comparing them because I don't think it's fair to Senne. But there's definitely similarities.\n\n\"You want a goalkeeper to be reliable and trustworthy. Instead of creating a chaos, you want him to take the chaos away and calm things down. I think Senne is that.\n\n\"He's quite quiet at times and unassuming, but he's got real steel. It's a big role for some, and it's about being comfortable in your environment.\n\n\"Sometimes it takes time, sometimes not, but he has that calmness and composure. It helps those in front of him an awful lot.\"\n\nAt the start of the season, United's stated aim was to get back into Europe.\n\nEven internally, it was felt reaching the Europa League was the most realistic target, and financial estimates were created around that.\n\nHowever, in the wake of Amorim's exit, director of football Jason Wilcox spoke to the players about reaching the Champions League.\n\nThe difference in status and finance is huge.\n\nUnited have now gone 10 consecutive Premier League games without defeat for the first time since a run of 14 between January and May 2021 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\n\nFrom their current position, with no European distractions, which is something Villa, Chelsea and Liverpool all have, it would be a major disappointment for them if United were not to seal a return to European football's top table.\n\n\"Manchester United are now virtually guarantees for one of the Champions League places,\" said Carragher. \"I can't see them not making it.\"\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Boxing greats Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather have agreed a professional rematch in September.\n\nPacquiao, 47, and Mayweather, 48, will fight at Sphere in Las Vegas on Saturday, 19 September, with the bout live on Netflix.\n\nFormer world champion Mayweather announced he would come out of retirement for a fourth time last week.\n\nIt will be the American's first professional fight since beating mixed martial arts fight Conor McGregor with a 10th-round technical knockout in 2017.\n\nFilipino Pacquiao retired from the sport to focus on his political career in 2021 but returned to the ring last July to fight WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios, who retained his title after a draw.\n\nMayweather and Pacquiao first met in 2015, in what was billed as the 'Fight of the Century' and remains the richest in boxing history.\n\nIt was Mayweather who emerged victorious, beating Pacquiao via a wide unanimous decision in Las Vegas.\n\nIt is not yet known over how many rounds or at what weight class the rematch will be contested.\n\nPacquiao, winner of 12 world titles across eight weight classes, said: \"Floyd and I gave the world what remains the biggest fight in boxing history.\n\n\"The fans have waited long enough. They deserve this rematch.\n\n\"I want Floyd to live with the one loss on his professional record and always remember who gave it to him.\"\n\nMayweather, who turns 49 on Tuesday, said: \"I already fought and beat Manny once. This time will be the same result.\"\n\nMayweather has won all 50-0 of his professional fights, with 27 coming by knockout.\n\nHe has had a string of exhibition bouts since retiring in 2017 and is scheduled to face Mike Tyson this year.\n\nThat is set to be former undisputed world heavyweight champion Tyson's first fight since the American ended his 19-year retirement in November in a controversial defeat by Youtuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul.\n\nAnnouncing the end of his retirement on Saturday, Mayweather said: \"From my upcoming Mike Tyson event to my next professional fight afterwards: no-one will generate a bigger gate, have a larger global broadcast audience and generate more money with each event than my events.\"\n\nPacquiao, who has 62 wins from his 73 bouts, said in October that the pair were close to agreeing a rematch – but added it was dependent on he and Mayweather being able to \"understand each other\".\n\nTheir previous meeting in 2015 generated a record 4.6 million pay-per-view buys and a record live gate of $72m at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.\n\nFull details regarding the undercard and ticket availability will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nWhat a chaotic few days it's been for boxing. After Conor Benn's shock move to Zuffa, the sport has barely had time to reset. But perhaps nothing in boxing should shock us any more.\n\nThe first Mayweather-Pacquiao fight was the one everyone demanded for years, yet when it finally arrived in 2015, it had come too late. And then it never lived up to the billing.\n\nSince then, nobody really has been clamouring for a rematch. Certainly not in 2026.\n\nWhen the rematch was announced, most boxing fans on social media assumed this would be an exhibition. It isn't.\n\nThe finer details are still unclear but if there are any special rules or conditions attached, that's unlikely to go down well with purists.\n\nThere is one hook: Mayweather putting his unbeaten record on the line. And with Netflix involved, you can expect the full promotional treatment - it will be sold as a global event for the casual sports fan.\n\nUltimately, both men will bank enormous purses for revisiting old ground, and it's hard to escape the feeling that this is being driven more by the money than anything else.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Italian cricket is in crisis days after the country's T20 World Cup debut, as it emerged that a senior national governing body official has been investigated over a sexual assault allegation.\n\nFederazione Cricket Italiana (FCRI) women's cricket co-ordinator Prabath Ekneligoda, 57, was the subject of a criminal investigation relating to a claim he inappropriately touched a member of the Azzurri women's national team.\n\nMultiple members of the Italy board are said to have resigned over this case and other governance issues, BBC Sport has been told.\n\nThe sexual assault allegation was made to police in Rome in March last year by a player who has represented the national team.\n\nThe player, whose identity is protected for legal reasons, alleged that the sexual assault occurred during a massage on a knee injury at a training session, and she had been scared to report the incident because she feared it would cost her a spot in the team.\n\nAn investigation was concluded by a Rome prosecutor in November 2025 and Ekneligoda was interviewed by police the following month.\n\nA decision is now set to be made on whether there is sufficient evidence to bring it to trial. Ekneligoda's lawyer said his client denies the allegation, that there are ulterior motives to the allegation, and that a witness supports his version of events.\n\nFCRI said in a statement to BBC Sport it \"noted proceedings are currently under way before the federal prosecutor's office\" and will \"co-operate with the relevant authorities\".\n\n\"The Italian Cricket Federation reiterates that its conduct is guided by principles of fairness, transparency and the protection of its registered members, as well as by the ethical and civic standards that underpin the sporting system,\" added the statement.\n\n\"The federation therefore defers to the competent judicial authorities for any determinations arising from the matter.\"\n\nEkneligoda, who is originally from Sri Lanka, was suspended from his role with the FCRI in November but has remained a visible presence on the Italian cricket scene.\n\nHe is the partner of FCRI president Maria Lorena Haz Paz and accompanied her to India for the men's T20 World Cup.\n\nBBC Sport has seen evidence that Ekneligoda attended Italy's matches wearing official accreditation and was permitted to sit with the rest of the FCRI party.\n\nEkneligoda was also seen at various events laid on for Italy's cricket delegation, including a reception at the Italian consulate in Kolkata for officials, players and coaching staff.\n\nThe FCRI, its president Haz Paz, and safeguarding officers, had full knowledge of the seriousness of the claim made against Ekneligoda before the World Cup.\n\nLast weekend, Il Messaggero, external and Corriere della Sera, external reported the allegation in the Italian media for the first time.\n\nAs of Monday, Ekneligoda was still listed as the women's cricket coordinator on the FCRI website.\n\nSources have told BBC Sport that some members of the FCRI's board have resigned over the matter, and other governance issues, which has placed Haz Paz's position under greater scrutiny.\n\nSenior officials in Italian cricket fear potential reputational damage, and the possibility of legal cases, will hamper opportunities to capitalise on their debut T20 World Cup appearance and grow the game further in the country.\n\nHaz Paz was appointed president of the Italian cricket federation in February 2025 until 2028.\n\nItaly's debut at the T20 World Cup, and the stories of some of their players, had captured the imagination of the cricket world.\n\nThe Azzurri failed to make the Super 8 stage but beat Nepal in Mumbai and gave England a scare in Kolkata in their Group C fixtures.\n\nIPL-linked teams 'not considering Pakistan players'\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\n\n'It smacks of England' - Australia fail again at T20 World Cup",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nDean Henderson (Crystal Palace): Not a great weekend for goalkeepers in terms of the shots faced. But a penalty save and a clean sheet against a poor Wolves team was big for Crystal Palace who really needed that win.\n\nVirgil van Dijk (Liverpool): People have been questioning whether he or John Terry is the better Premier League centre-back. For me, Van Dijk is just a Rolls-Royce and the two of them go in the same category. He delivers all the time and has started to make Milos Kerkez look better with his organisation. It was a tough game against Forest but he stood up and delivered.\n\nHarry Maguire (Manchester United): Mr Dependable. I was going to put Luke Shaw in but Harry just got the nod. Manchester United are on a great run under Michael Carrick and look like they are continuing to be a solid team, and Maguire being fit and available has coincided with that. He was great for Ruben Amorim and now he's great again. Not so long ago, they were trying to shift him out for anything and now he is the Guvnor.\n\nLewis Hall (Newcastle): I had to find a place for him because he has been fantastic over the course of the Premier League and even though his goal against Manchester City was a deflected strike, I just thought he was brilliant.\n\nNico O'Reilly (Manchester City): The player of the weekend for me, and the player of the month by a country mile. Since O'Reilly has moved into that midfield, Rodri has looked better, Manchester City have looked better, he has looked amazing and the job he has done for the past 18 months at left-back shows his versatility. What a player. Both his goals against Newcastle were great and totally different. He offers so much to Manchester City and is a shoo-in for the England squad. We were looking at him as a left-back but does he now play midfield?\n\nAnton Stach (Leeds): I thought Leeds might falter and fall away. I think they have to be careful with these draws but he was a really good performer against Aston Villa - and that free-kick he scored against a World-Cup winning goalkeeper in Emi Martinez means he goes in my team.\n\nEberechi Eze (Arsenal): He has to go in this week with his two goals against Spurs on Sunday. He has scored five goals against them now in two games - so Spurs are obviously his team to face. Good for him and good for Mikel Arteta to pick him. He has been up and down this season, in and out of the team, but this will be a real confidence booster for him and Arsenal.\n\nDiego Gomez (Brighton): He got a goal in the win against Brentford, but it was also an important midfield performance from him. Brentford weren't at their best, with injuries in the squad, but you have to be able to break through the lines and he did that a lot. He was fantastic. It was Brighton's first win in seven league games and they needed it.\n\nZian Flemming (Burnley): Yes, he scored against Chelsea, but it was an old-school number nine performance. I have got a lot of time for this sort of display. He was horrible, he was beating people up, making little fouls, and was a real nuisance. He was doing it to the point where Chelsea were getting so frustrated, he was probably part of the reason why Wesley Fofana got sent off.\n\nViktor Gyokeres (Arsenal): He scored two against Spurs. Yes, the opposition were mediocre with a terrible backline but he doesn't care. The rest of his play was better as well. I can't give him too much credit, but you can only score against the teams put in front of you.\n\nRaul Jimenez (Fulham): He goes through these spells when he scores a run of goals and he looks a real top player. Then he goes quiet again. He scored another couple of goals at Sunderland on Sunday - he is a big powerful player, and the one thing you know is he is going to work that backline on his own.\n\nMikel Arteta (Arsenal): It was a big week for the Arsenal manager. With Manchester City winning, there was a lot of pressure on his team going into the north London derby against a poor Spurs team. Arsenal had to handle the pressure and they did that very well. I give Arteta all the credit. He is handling it every step of the way.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?
