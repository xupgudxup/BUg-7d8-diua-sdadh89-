Add us as a preferred source on your Google account here.\n\nThe battle for the final podium spot in the men’s ice hockey tournament is set, with Slovakia taking on Finland in the Bronze Medal Game at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics on Saturday, February 21.\n\nMy top Finland vs. Slovakia predictions and free betting picks expect Finland to win, extending their streak as the longest-standing nation to medal in Olympic tournaments featuring NHL players.\n\nFinland vs Slovakia Best bet: Finland -1.5 (+125 at BET99)\n\nDespite Slovakia winning 4-1 in the tournament opener, Finland generated 65.9% of the scoring chances.\n\nThe Finns just need more finish on those chances to take home the bronze medal and podium at the Olympics for the fourth consecutive time with NHL players, and that's a claim to fame no other country can match.\n\nMedaling will be both a point of pride for the Finns and an opportunity to kick the stink from the preliminary loss to the Slovaks.\n\nimg src=\"https://img.covers.com/betting/sportsbooks/82/bet99.svg\" alt=\"Bet99\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"194\" height=\"62\"\n\nIn addition to the highlighted mismatch, Finland gave Canada a good scare, and the Finns have allowed just 10 goals through five games. Finnish No. 1 Juuse Saros is also sporting an elite .938 save percentage after turning away 36 of 39 Canadian shots Friday.\n\nThe Slovaks lack the same firepower, and I expect the Finns to clog the neutral zone and rely on their depth of defensively responsible NHLers, just as they did against Canada in the semifinal.\n\nMoneyline: Finland -230 | Slovakia +175\n\nPuck Line: Finland -1.5 (+125) | Slovakia +1.5 (-160)\n\nOver/Under: Over 5.5 (+100) | Under 5.5 (-130)\n\nMilano Santagiulia Arena, Milan, Italy\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Dodgers begin Cactus League play on Saturday, but early spring training action on Friday showed a high-profile free agent already making an impact at his new home. There were also updates about two pitchers on either side of Tommy John surgery.\n\nPete Alonso seems to be settling in nicely in Baltimore after leaving the New York Mets in free agency.\n\nAlonso, who signed a five year, $155 million contract with the Orioles late last year, blasted a two-run home run in the team’s spring training matchup with the Yankees.\n\nOrioles manager Craig Albernaz said Alonso asked for the third at-bat that resulted in the bomb, as reported by the Associated Press.\n\n“He wanted it, and he made the most of it,” Albernaz said. “It speaks a lot. Pete just wants to play.”\n\nAs reported by Chris Kirschner of The Athletic, Gerrit Cole wowed his teammates in his first live batting practice since Tommy John surgery.\n\nCole hit 97 mph with some pitches and managed to strike out one of the three batters he faced.\n\nYankees superstar Aaron Judge, who grounded out off a Cole pitch during the brief session, said his teammate again looked like the great pitcher who won the 2003 American League Cy Young Award.\n\n“Gerrit looked great,” Judge said. “Excited to see him back on the mound. That was the most important thing. The stuff is still electric.\n\nFull AB: Trent Grisham strikes out on a 95 mph fastball from Gerrit Cole pic.twitter.com/nh5TFcJYZQ\n\n— Chris Kirschner (@ChrisKirschner) February 20, 2026\n\nOn the other end of the Tommy John spectrum, Pablo Lopez will indeed have to undergo the procedure after tearing his ulnar collateral ligament.\n\nThe tear was reported earlier this week, though the details of the procedure have now been confirmed.\n\n“The team said Friday that López’s surgery will be performed next week in Texas by Rangers team physician Dr. Keith Meister,” the Associated Press reports. “López turns 30 early next month.”\n\nLopez missed significant time last season with injuries, but he still posted a 2.74 ERA in 14 starts.\n\nHe will also miss pitching for Team Venezuela in the upcoming World Baseball Classic.",

    "fullText": "Antoine Semenyo has made an impressive start to life at Manchester City. Since signing for City from Bournemouth, the Ghana international has scored five goals and added two assists in nine appearances for Pep Guardiola’s side. Semenyo, alongside Marc Guehi, arrived at City during last month’s transfer window, and the pair have made an immediate impact on their new team. In Semenyo’s case, Pep Guardiola has praised the powerful winger for the impact he has already made for his team. Looking further ahead, you do sense that Semenyo has barely scratched the surface of what he will become as a Manchester City player.\n\nSpeaking ahead of Manchester City’s pivotal Premier League fixture against Newcastle, Pep Guardiola praised the impact that Antoine Semenyo has made since signing for Manchester City. He explained: “It’s not just scoring a lot of goals. The strikers and the players who play up front are so important. Not just that. (He) makes a special rhythm, his versatility to play many positions up front and in the three positions.”\n\n“We knew it and comes from Bournemouth, they are exceptional in the rhythm and defensively and he has it in his DNA. His impact has been really good.”\n\nPep Guardiola also has confidence in Antoine Semenyo’s ability to play on the biggest stage in the UEFA Champions League. The Ghana international is yet to play in the competition, but that opportunity awaits him as this season progresses. Guardiola added: “Antoine we played against him many times in the last years and whether he can be top class or elite, we have to see. I don’t know, when you buy a player from a club, they come here, see how he adapts to play in the Champions League where he hasn’t played before.”\n\n“The biggest stages in the Premier League, yes, but in the knockout stages in the position is a good test for him. How he will react. I’m pretty sure his mentality, I think he will handle it quite well.”\n\nThere is no doubt that Antoine Semenyo, along with Marc Guehi, has made an immediate impact at Manchester City. This City side does feel immediately stronger with their addition. The pair were ready to make the next step in their careers. They forged their way in the Premier League at Bournemouth and Crystal Palace, and a move to a club like City was the logical next step for both players. Antoine Semenyo has made an impressive start to life as a City player. His goals have been crucial. In terms of what Semenyo can become as a City player, he is yet to scratch the surface of what he will become.\n\nAs impressive as Semenyo’s start to life at Manchester City has been, the areas of his game that need to be tidied up stand out. Semenyo has been clunky in possession at times, and he has been guilty of losing possession. He also needs to learn the nuances of Manchester City’s high defensive press. That will all come in time. Semenyo is currently learning on the fly. He is also yet to develop a proper understanding with Erling Haaland, Jeremy Doku, Phil Foden, Rayan Cherki, and the remainder of his City teammates. The more he plays, the more that will all come. So while Semenyo has made an immediate impact already, the ceiling is incredibly high for what the Ghana international will become for Pep Guardiola’s side.\n\nAntoine Semenyo has rightly been praised by Pep Guardiola for his fast start to life at Manchester City. He has already made a tremendous contribution. Looking further ahead, Semenyo has more room to grow as a City player, and that in itself is a fantastic proposition to ponder for the future for Semenyo and Manchester City.",

    "fullText": "No. 19 Clemson turned a tight game into a comfortable win in a matter of minutes on Friday night.\n\nSix runs in the bottom of the eighth inning broke open a 3-3 tie and carried the Tigers to a 9-3 victory over Bryant in the opener of a three-game set at Doug Kingsmore Stadium. Clemson moved to 5-0 on the season, while the Bulldogs dropped to 1-3.\n\nThe game swung on a chaotic eighth. After loading the bases, true freshman Jason Fultz worked a walk to force in the go-ahead run, the first RBI of his career. Following a strikeout, Tryston McCladdie lined a two-run single into right to stretch the lead to 6-3. Clemson wasn’t finished. Luke Gaffney added an RBI walk with the bases loaded, Ty Dalley lifted a sacrifice fly, and Jack Crighton capped the inning with a run-scoring single.\n\nGaffney set the tone early at the plate, finishing a perfect 3-for-3 with a solo homer and two RBIs. Crighton also had three hits and drove in a run, while Jacob Jarrell went 2-for-3 with a homer, an RBI and two runs scored.\n\nBryant grabbed an early lead in the second when a ball off the bat of Charlie Saul skipped past centerfielder Bryce Clavon and rolled to the wall, allowing Saul to circle the bases. Clemson answered quickly. Gaffney launched a solo shot to left to tie it, and Jarrell followed Crighton’s single with a two-run homer to make it 3-1.\n\nThe Bulldogs evened the score in the seventh, capitalizing on a double and a fielding error that led to two unearned runs. Defensive miscues proved costly again for Clemson, which committed three errors. All three Bryant runs were unearned, and the Bulldogs managed just two hits all night.\n\nOn the mound, Aidan Knaak was sharp in his start, striking out eight over five innings while allowing just one unearned run on one hit. Justin LeGuernic followed and logged two-plus innings, surrendering only one hit. Joe Allen entered in the eighth after a leadoff walk and retired the next three hitters, striking out two to earn his second win. Nathan Dvorsky closed the door with a clean ninth.\n\nReacting to Clemson stars landing spots in ESPN’s best QBs of 2000’s https://t.co/LH8iUNef1T pic.twitter.com/foJNyTWKws\n\n— Clemson Wire (@Clemson_Wire) February 20, 2026\n\nClemson’s pitching staff racked up 14 strikeouts, a season high, and has now allowed just two earned runs through five games.\n\nThe same two teams meet again on Saturday, with first pitch scheduled for 2 p.m. Michael Sharman is slated to start for the Tigers.\n\nContact us @Clemson_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook for ongoing coverage of Clemson Tigers news and notes, plus opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Clemson Wire: Clemson baseball takes down Bryant after a massive 8th inning",

    "fullText": "Ryan Garcia is planning to put on a show tomorrow.\n\nOn Saturday evening, Garcia challenges WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios when the two square off at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. Both men are in rough patches in their careers, with Garcia coming in off a loss to Rolando Romero for the WBA welterweight title in May, while Barrios has retained his title in back-to-back draws in his previous two bouts.\n\nThe lead-up to their fight on Saturday has been mostly respectful between the two, and remained that way during the ceremonial weigh-ins on Friday night, though the two did have a prolonged final faceoff.\n\n𝗪𝗕𝗖 𝗔𝗡𝗗 𝗥𝗜𝗡𝗚 𝗝𝗨𝗡𝗜𝗢𝗥 𝗪𝗘𝗟𝗧𝗘𝗥𝗪𝗘𝗜𝗚𝗛𝗧 𝗧𝗜𝗧𝗟𝗘𝗦 𝗢𝗡 𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘 🏆\n\nMario Barrios 🆚 Ryan Garcia \n\n🎟️ Buy BARRIOS VS GARCIA HERE –> https://t.co/FoiaUucafv#TheRingHighStakes | Feb 21 | Live Exclusively on DAZN | @RingMagazine ▪️ pic.twitter.com/WyJ0U7CC1K\n\n— DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nFollowing the faceoff, both men gave their final thoughts on the fight, with Garcia promising a much more exciting performance on Saturday than he gave against Romero last year.\n\n“You’re going to see a ferocious Ryan Garcia in the ring,” Garcia said. “We’re not here to play games. From that start of the bell, we’ll be ready to fight. … We’re going to be ferocious when it comes to that ring, and we’re getting right to it. …\n\n“I’m coming to light lightning, baby. You don’t want to miss this one, I promise you. This is going to be a Ryan Garcia classic. You don’t want to miss this one, I promise.”\n\nBarrios was less animated than Garcia, but no less confident, praising the challenger’s skills while maintaining he may have a surprise in store for “King” Ryan on Saturday.\n\n“Both of his hands are dangerous,” Barrios said. “He definitely has an equalizer with that hook. But like I said, everything we worked on. I also have a hook, I’ve got two hands, and I think that there’s a lot that he has to look out for. …\n\n“I’m going in there with bad intentions. Going in there, like I said, with all the work we put in. I think this fight could definitely end early.”\n\nGarcia vs. Barrios takes place this Saturday night, with prelims starting at 6 p.m. ET and available on MMA Fighting, while the main card kicks off at 8 p.m. on DAZN.",

    "description": "Benn has left Hearn’s company, joining rival promoter Dana White in a shocking move",
    "fullText": "Eddie Hearn has claimed he “misjudged the character” of Conor Benn, after the boxer left Matchroom to join rival promoter Dana White.\n\nOn Friday, it was announced that Benn had joined Zuffa Boxing, which is spearheaded by UFC president White. And the move comes just days after White launched a scathing attack on Hearn, saying the British promoter lacks “vision”.\n\nBenn’s decision to leave Matchroom is particularly shocking given he has spent his entire professional career with Hearn’s company, which even stood by the 29-year-old from 2022 until 2025, during a saga in which he failed two drug tests and could not box on home soil.\n\n“I blame myself, because I just forgot it was boxing, you know?” Hearn told iFL TV late on Friday, admitting he was “pretty devastated”. “I was like... I just felt that the loyalty that we’ve shown would never, ever put us in this position.\n\n“And I just felt that I never really needed to push Conor Benn to sign a new contract previously, and I probably could’ve got him to sign a new contract previously.\n\n“Like I said, I blame myself. I made a mistake, because I misjudged the character. And again, I’m not gonna hang him out to dry, and he will say: ‘Well, it was a big offer.’\n\n“But when I received the email from his lawyer, I texted him and said: ‘I think we should have a call. I think, for everything I’ve done for you, I think I deserve a call. And he said ‘no’, and I was like: ‘Man... f***... I can’t believe it.’\n\n“I just don’t know what to say, other than I just felt that everything that we gave him, the loyalty that we gave him, the support we gave him, would be enough to talk it through – or just get close to a number, but there wasn’t really the interest.\n\n“So, very surprising, very painful, but just another moment in life that you live and learn from [...] You lose a bit of your soul. It’s a little bit numb. There’s a lot I could say.\n\n“He doesn’t think like he’s done anything wrong, but that’s him as a person. Sometimes you can get poisoned.\n\n‼️ Eddie Hearn on Conor Benn signing with Zuffa Boxing: \"I blame myself because I forgot it was boxing and I was like — I just felt that the loyalty that we've shown would never ever put us in this position and I just felt that I never really needed to push Conor Benn to sign a… pic.twitter.com/SAZgZcObRg\n\n— EverythingBoxing | Darshan Desai (@EverythingBoxi2) February 20, 2026\n\n“[Anthony] Joshua, you can’t mention those in the same breath – for many reasons. Joshua is a different breed of class and loyalty,” Hearn added, referencing his highest-profile boxer.\n\nBenn, the son of British boxing great Nigel Benn, released a statement on Friday upon the announcement of his move, and the welterweight said he hoped he could still work with Hearn going forward.\n\n“First and foremost, I want to thank Eddie and the entire team at Matchroom for everything they’ve done for me over the past decade,” said Benn. “From guiding me when I first turned pro, to headlining stadium shows, they were not only with me for those highlight moments but stood shoulder to shoulder with me during the tough times.\n\n“It’s been a journey beyond anything we could have imagined, and for their belief, support and guidance, I will always be truly grateful, but Zuffa Boxing presented me with an opportunity I simply couldn’t refuse.\n\n“I’d love Eddie to continue to be part of my team and for our partnership to evolve in this new chapter.\n\n“I’m filled with excitement and hunger for what’s ahead with Zuffa Boxing. I want the legacy fights, the biggest nights, the biggest stages. I fear no man at any weight, and I’m ready to give the fans the fights they’ve been calling for. I’m in my prime, and together we have bold, ambitious plans.”\n\nZuffa Boxing is being up by White and Saudi government official Turki Alalshikh, the latter of whom has been pivotal to the Gulf nation’s boxing drive in recent years.",

    "description": "The FC Bayern star is having an incredible season.",
    "fullText": "There is something undeniably encouraging about hearing a player speak with clarity, confidence, and humility all at once—and that is exactly the tone Luis Díaz struck when reflecting on his current level. For Bayern Munich supporters, it is the kind of mindset that suggests not just a short burst of form, but a sustained period of influence at the highest level.\n\n“Yes, I think so. I’ve actually been in very good form since I left Colombia. I had a couple of very good seasons in Porto. Things also went very well for me in Liverpool, especially last season. But I think that over time I’ve simply grown a lot more as a footballer and also as a person, that I’ve learned a lot more. It just helps when you’re more mature. And today I feel at 100% – physically and mentally. I think I’m going through a very good time right now, and I’m trying to enjoy that on the one hand… but on the other hand, also to keep doing things right and not be complacent. Because that’s what it’s all about: staying grounded and continuing to help my team. That’s the most important thing,” Díaz told Sky Germany’s Kerry Hau (as captured by @iMiaSanMia).\n\nWhat stands out most is not just the confidence, but the balance. Díaz is not declaring himself finished product or superstar above reproach. Instead, he frames his rise as a process—one built through experience in Portugal and England, personal growth, and the discipline to remain grounded even when things are going well.\n\nThat mentality fits perfectly within Bayern Munich’s long-standing culture. The club has always thrived on players who combine elite talent with relentless professionalism. If Díaz truly feels “at 100% – physically and mentally,” then Bayern may be witnessing the beginning of a particularly dangerous phase in his career.\n\nFor fans, that is the most exciting takeaway. Form can fluctuate, but maturity and mindset tend to last. And if Díaz continues pairing confidence with humility, his “very good time” might extend far beyond the present moment.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "description": "High school girls basketball: Dixie grinds past Desert Hills in 4A semifinal foul fest",
    "fullText": "Here’s a recap of the 4A girls basketball state tournament semifinals at Weber State on Friday, with No. 1 Dixie winning the first game to advance to Saturday’s championship. This story will be updated.\n\nFor the first time in 13 years, Dixie’s girls basketball team will play for the state championship after winning an exhausting semifinal nailbiter over Desert Hills 60-55 on Friday afternoon.\n\nDixie coach Kasey Winters remembers the Flyers’ last championship well, as he was there. Granted, he was waiting in the tunnels at Weber State to coach the Bear River boys in the 3A championship immediately after the girls game.\n\nDixie’s girls won that championship over Desert Hills in a thriller, while Winters’ Bears lost.\n\nThe second-year Dixie coach is hoping this time he gets to cut down the nets on Saturday when his team faces the Green Canyon-Pine View winner at 1 p.m.\n\nAdvancing to the championship was an absolute grind against Desert Hills, which plays a relentless full-court game for 32 minutes.\n\n“I think it just wears on you physically and mentally,” Winters said. “We just have to preach like it’s going to be that way the whole game.\n\n“You can’t expect any breaks. You can’t expect to just be able to walk it up the court. You have to be ready for pressure and physicality for 32 straight minutes.”\n\nDixie handled the pressure much better in the second half in a back-and-forth game that featured nine lead changes and six ties.\n\nThe constant pressure resulted in a lot of whistles, with 43 combined fouls and both teams dealing with foul trouble for much of the game.\n\nWinters said the style wasn’t surprising, as it mirrored Dixie’s two region wins over Desert Hills earlier this season.\n\n“Both teams are athletic, they’re physical, we both like to try to cause a little bit of chaos and ultimately it ends up in a lot of fouls for both teams,” said Winters.\n\nDesert Hills dealt with the chaos better early on, jumping out to a 13-7 lead after the first quarter, but Dixie made a push in the second quarter to claim a 23-21 halftime lead despite a dozen first-half turnovers.\n\n“We gave them quite a few possessions just because we weren’t tough with the ball and we weren’t ready for the pressure that we should know is coming,” said Winters.\n\nIt spilled over into the third quarter as well, with Desert Hills opening on a 11-0 spurt to build its largest lead of the game at 32-23 with 5:46 left in the frame.\n\n“Yeah, it wasn’t our best start to the second half, but we knew there was a lot of game left and that’s kind of what we said in the timeout, is just have to stop turning the ball over, get a couple stops,” said Winters.\n\nThe lead changed hands four more times in the fourth as the fouls and free throws mounted for both teams. Crucially, Dixie finished the game 19 of 26 from the free throw line while Desert Hills was 13 of 23.\n\nTrailing 51-49 with under three minutes remaining, Desert Hills’ Ellie Heaton hit a huge 3-pointer to put the Thunder ahead and answer a big 3 from Dixie leading-scorer Izzy Hollinghead — her only 3 of the game.\n\nOrton had a huge response a minute later with her fourth 3-pointer of the game, putting Dixie ahead for good 54-53 with 1:51 left.\n\nShe finished 4 of 8 from behind the arc with 12 points. She was one of four Dixie players who scored in double figures, led by Addison Winters with 15, Hollinghead with 14 and Lydia Shurtliff adding 10.\n\n“I love seeing that four or five people in double figures. It means we’re moving the ball, we’re not forcing shots and we’re just playing good team basketball,” said Winters.\n\nAfter pulling ahead, Dixie forced Desert Hills into three turnovers in the final two minutes and then it successfully sealed the win from the foul line.",

    "description": "Peterson is viewed as the No. 1 overall pick in this year's NBA Draft, but questions about his availability could affect that status.",
    "fullText": "Amid star player Darryn Peterson facing criticism for missing games or leaving them early due to injuries or illness, Kansas men's basketball coach Bill Self says the freshman guard must take initiative to change the national conversation about him.\n\n\"There is a way to change the narrative. Play. Finish,\" Self told reporters on Friday. \"Now, if his body allows him to, fantastic. If it doesn't allow him to, then they'll say something again the next game.\"\n\n\"But that's the way to get people to quit talking,\" he added. \"It's not me saying, 'It's not fair.' I don't think that really keeps anybody from having an opinion on a national level, or on this level, or any level, to be quite candid.\"\n\nPeterson, 19, has played in only 15 of the Jayhawks' 26 games this season. But he has also left three of those games early, most recently Wednesday's 81-69 win over Oklahoma State. Peterson has missed games due to hamstring, quad and ankle injuries and taken himself out because of flu-like symptoms and cramping.\n\nThat limited availability has led to questions about Peterson protecting himself for the 2026 NBA Draft, which could affect his prospects of being the No. 1 overall pick.\n\nSelf says the speculation over why Peterson has missed games or finished them early is misguided, but acknowledges that such conjecture can't be controlled.\n\n\"He hasn't finished games. The reasons why they say he hasn't finished games is 100% false,\" Self said. \"So, at least in 70 to 80% of the reasons why, with what they've said that I've heard. I can't say 100% of everything would be false, but that's the narrative that's being out there.\"\n\nThe Kansas coach asserted the speculation over Peterson's mindset is \"100% false,\" then seemed to say, well, maybe it's not entirely false. But that chatter will only be silenced if Peterson plays and continues to show the talent that makes many evaluators believe he will be the top player available in this summer's NBA Draft.\n\nBill Self on Darryn Peterson:\n\n\"He hasn't finished games... The bottom line is, there is a way to change the narrative: Play. Finish. That's the way to get people to quit talking.\" 👀\n\n(🎥: @KUsports) pic.twitter.com/71bbB7sD7q\n\n— The Field of 68 (@TheFieldOf68) February 20, 2026\n\n[Get more Jayhawks news: Kansas team feed]\n\nIn his 15 games, Peterson has averaged 20 points per game while shooting 43% on 3-pointers. Despite leaving the matchup with Oklahoma State after playing 18 minutes, he still scored 23 points and shot 6-for-10 from long range. Peterson scored a season-high 32 points in a 104-100 overtime win over TCU. That's the kind of production that has NBA teams coveting the opportunity to draft him.\n\nSelf supported Peterson, saying that he's dedicated to basketball in addition to being a gifted scorer.\n\nI don't know that we've had a guy that studies the game, has prepared himself for this moreso than what Darryn Peterson has,\" Self said. \"He loves ball. He can't get enough ball... Nobody's put more time in outside of practice working on their game on an individual than what he has over a lifetime.\"\n\nWith five games remaining in Kansas' regular season, along with the Big 12 conference and NCAA tournaments approaching, Peterson has plenty of opportunity to alter whatever perceptions are being formed about him. Especially if that includes a national championship run. The Jayhawks face Cincinnati (14-12) on Saturday before big matchups versus No. 2 Houston (23-3) and No. 4 Arizona (24-2) next week.",

    "fullText": "The coaching carousel for the 2025-2026 men's college basketball season is starting to heat up.\n\nNumerous programs around the country are virtually eliminated from NCAA Tournament contention, barring a surprise conference championship win. Some athletic directors are already starting to get ahead of the curve and filing away candidates.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Kansas State said it fired Jerome Tang 'for cause.' Will that hold up in court?\n\nKansas State's Jerome Tang was one of the first major dominos to fall, although there's still discourse between Tang and the school regarding his $18.7 million buyout. Kansas State claims it has bounds to fire Tang for cause, which would invalidate the total.\n\nThere are multiple mid-major coaches that are also on the rise and could be next up for Power Four gigs. Names like Saint Louis' Josh Schertz, New Mexico's Eric Olen and Utah State's Jerrod Calhoun have all been wildly successful in 2025-26.\n\nHere's a running list of every head coaching change during the 2025-26 men's college basketball season:\n\nThis story will be updated live.\n\nScott was suspended indefinitely in January while being investigated for treatment of Air Force's cadet-athletes. It was announced Feb. 20, however, that he and the school mutually agreed to part ways.\n\n\"Coach Scott's passion for the game of basketball has long been evident in his competitive and direct coaching style. It was this coaching style that guided Air Force Basketball to some of the program's most memorable achievements during his initial tenure at the Air Force Academy,\" Air Force athletic director Nathan Pine said in the announcement. \"This is a different day, and now is the right time for a new voice and a new approach to drive the culture and success of the men's basketball program, aligned with the Air Force Academy's mission of forging leaders of character developed to lead in our Air Force and Space Force.\n\n\"We thank Coach Scott for his 10 years of service to the Academy and wish him and his family well.\"\n\nAir Force went 97-183 in Scott's second tenure as head coach from 2020 onward. He also led the program from 2000-04, taking the team to an NCAA Tournament berth in 2004. - Austin Curtright\n\nLavin won't return to San Diego for the 2026-27 season but will remain as head coach for the remainder of the current campaign. The former UCLA and St. John's coach has a 46-79 record at San Diego in four seasons, and currently holds an 11-17 mark this season.\n\n\"As my coaching tenure at USD begins to wind down, I would like to pause and express my heartfelt appreciation to President Jim Harris for presenting this life-changing opportunity in 2022,\" Lavin said in the announcement. \"Teaching and coaching at the University of San Diego has been an experience of unparalleled pride and joy. Specifically, I will carry forward the gift of participating in our players' journeys, and will treasure the relationships forged along the way.\" - Austin Curtright\n\nTang led Kansas State to the Elite Eight in his first season at the helm in 2022-23, but it was a downward spiral from there. The Wildcats failed to reach the NCAA Tournament the next two seasons and had a 10-15 record with a 1-11 mark in conference play this season before Tang was fired.\n\n“This was a decision that was made in the best interest of our university and men’s basketball program,\" K-State athletic director Gene Taylor said. “Recent public comments and conduct, in addition to the program’s overall direction, have not aligned with K-State’s standards for supporting student-athletes and representing the university. We wish Coach Tang and his family all the best moving forward.”\n\nKansas State is attempting to fire Tang for cause after he called out his players in a press conference after a blowout loss against Cincinnati. - Austin Curtright\n\nKansas City announced in January that Menzies would finish out the season at Kansas City but wouldn't be returning for the 2026-27 season. The Roos hired former Maryland coach Mark Turgeon shortly after. - Austin Curtright\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Men's college basketball coach firings, changes in 2025-26 season",

    "description": "Stop the count: Mariners enter tie for first place with 1-0 record",
    "fullText": "It’s been four months since the Seattle Mariners played a baseball game. Four months can feel like a long time. A lot happened: the holidays came and went, various roster moves were (and weren’t) made, Rick Rizzs announced his impending retirement, the Seahawks won the Super Bowl, nearly the entirety of the Winter Olympics have happened… et cetera. Still, despite how much has happened, just 123 days have passed since the Seattle Mariners last played a baseball game.\n\n“123 days” feels like a lot less time than “4 months”. I’m not sure why — maybe just a quirk of human bias and perception. For most of the last month, I’d identified more with the “4 months” side of things. It seemed like forever since we had baseball. To have gone from each day being punctuated with the joy of the 2025 Mariners, to each having no clear punctuation at all… well, they call it the bleak midwinter for a reason.\n\nToday, though, it felt like baseball never left. From the moment this morning that the Mariners posted the first lineup card of 2026, all the way through the last pitch that non-roster invitee Nick Davila delivered to close out the ninth inning, today was a continuation of the excitement, joy, and momentum of 2025. Peoria Sports Complex looked and sounded like it was at capacity. Nary a patch of grass in the outfield was unoccupied, and every exciting moment on the field was answered by a chorus of jubilant cheers.\n\nIt helped that the Mariners’ starting lineup was mostly comprised of their actual projected Opening Day lineup. The same cannot be said of the pitching, as the team looks to more slowly bring their big-league staff up to speed. Non-roster invitee Dane Dunning took the bump for Seattle. Dunning, who projects to be a (hopefully unneeded) depth piece for the Mariners this year, ended up throwing 1.2 scoreless innings after working around some early traffic. His fastball, which last year averaged a hair above 90 MPH, sat around 89 MPH for most of the day. The presence of full Statcast numbers in Spring Training this year is fun. However, as I scour Dane Dunning’s February 20th velocity and vertical break, searching for meaning, it occurs to me that the availability of these data may not be optimal for my mental health. Verdict: Dunning looked fine.\n\nThe rest of today’s pitching staff for Seattle was comprised mainly of Guys on the Pile. One highlight was newcomer Cooper Criswell, acquired from the Red Sox over the offseason. Criswell, a soft-tossing righty, induced three strikeouts over two innings, including a particularly nasty one of Manny Machado.\n\nAnother familiar face was Troy Taylor, who looks to bounce back from a disappointing 2025. Taylor’s velocity was great: he was already up and over last year’s average speed of 96. Less great was a hung sinker that Romeo Sanabria whacked 416 feet over the center field fence.\n\nRight hander Alex Hoppe, who the Mariners also acquired from the Red Sox this winter, had a doubly disappointing afternoon. A dinger surrendered to Jose Miranda might have been bad enough, but the broadcasting team outed Hoppe as a true sicko: apparently his favorite player growing up was Jack Flaherty? First of all, Flaherty is literally 30 years old and Hoppe is 27, so I truly do not know when he would have idolized Flaherty. Secondly, even if the timeline did make any sense, Hoppe is likely the first person ever to idolize Jack Flaherty.\n\nFortunately, the hitters on Seattle’s side were a lot more interesting than the pitchers. Luke Raley, Julio Rodríguez, Josh Naylor, Leo Rivas, and Dom Canzone each checked in with hits in their first game back (Raley had two). Canzone made a flashy play in right field, laying out for a sinking line drive to rescue Dunning’s first inning. The real story of today, though, was the young guys. Most specifically Michael Arroyo.\n\nArroyo, a 21-year-old second baseman who just today was revealed to be working out at third base and in the outfield, watched the first pitch he was thrown. It was a changeup on the corner, called a ball. The Padres challenged, and it was overturned. Arroyo fouled off a second changeup to go down 0-2. A third changeup went right down the middle, and Arroyo took it the other way. It looked somewhat innocuous off the bat, but the ball carried, and carried, and carried. 406 feet later, Arroyo had recorded Seattle’s first home run of 2026.\n\nStar prospect Colt Emerson immediately hit a ball in nearly the exact same spot, but it died before reaching the fence.\n\nArroyo’s very next at bat saw him hit another ball hard to the same spot. This one dropped short of the fence, but Arroyo was left standing on second base for a double. Not a bad showing for the 67th ranked prospect in all of baseball.\n\nThe final effort from today that I wanted to highlight was from fellow Top 100 Prospect Lazaro Montes. In the box score, Montes’ day didn’t look overly impressive: 1-for-3 with a single and a strikeout. The single, however, was one of the more difficult ones you’re likely to see.\n\nThe at bat in question was against Padres flamethrower Mason Miller, who we all know well from his days with the Athletics. Montes started by working a 2-2 count off Miller — an impressive feat in its own right. Miller responded by dialing up a 101.5 MPH fastball, which he lost control of. The resulting errant pitch nearly decapitated Montes, who had to leap out of the way. With a slight smile on his face, Montes dug back into the box and fouled off another 101.5 MPH fastball. Miller tried to switch it up with a slider, which Montes pulled for a line drive single into right field. Talk about Big League stuff from the 21-year-old.\n\nCountless battles of NRI-on-NRI later, the Mariners were left standing with a 7-4 advantage over the Padres. Sure, the game was meaningless. Though, isn’t every game meaningless in the long run? Everything, even?\n\nWith meaning ultimately left as an exercise for the reader, I hope you enjoyed seeing the sunlight today, even if it was through a laptop or television screen. Fewer than five weeks remain until Opening Day and fewer than three until Daylight Savings. We made it.",

    "description": "Comment: Precocious talent, mental-health concerns, and a failed drug test – what next for Garcia? Possibly a showdown with Britain’s Benn",
    "fullText": "Ryan Garcia and Conor Benn are a match made in hell, in the exact way that makes them heaven for boxing promoters. For now, a match-up between the American and the Briton is in purgatory, but the barriers could come crumbling down on Saturday.\n\nIn Las Vegas, Garcia will challenge Mario Barrios for the WBC welterweight title, to which Benn is the next mandatory challenger.\n\nNever mind the fact that Garcia, 27, is receiving this title shot on the back of a loss, in which he was dropped and outpointed by underdog Rolly Romero. Never mind that he entered the Romero fight after a year-long drug ban. Never mind that Benn’s last two fights were middleweight bouts with Chris Eubank Jr, in which he went 1-1. Never mind that he went through his own drug-test saga beforehand. All roads lead to Garcia vs Benn.\n\nStill, the terrain is often rocky in this sport.\n\nBenn, 29, has long said his greatest desire is to become WBC welterweight champion, yet he has also barked at any American star who will listen, as well as a 47-year-old Manny Pacquiao. Just a few weeks ago, the Briton was face-to-face with new WBO champion Shakur Stevenson, having “messaged” the four-weight king over a possible showdown in the preceding weeks.\n\nYet the general thinking is that the unbeaten Stevenson, 28, would prove too slick for Benn, in a way that the inconsistent Garcia might not. Indeed, in Garcia, Benn might have found the ideal opponent and perfect rivalry to follow the blood feud with Eubank Jr.\n\nHowever, Garcia must first overcome Barrios, and “King Ryan”’s past struggles in and out of the ring mean that is no guarantee. One cannot overlook his loss to Romero in May, his stoppage by Gervonta Davis in 2023, nor past concerns over his mental health – due to, in his own words, his habit of “drinking every day” before his bout with Devin Haney.\n\nIn that contest in 2024, Garcia was electric. He had gone 3-3 with his fellow American during their amateur careers, but the feeling was that, at this level, the unbeaten Haney would prove too clinical and elusive for Garcia. But Garcia dropped the “Dream” three times en route to a points win. Of course, that victory was ruined by the revelation of a failed drug test, with the result overturned and Garcia banned for a year.\n\nNaturally, that adverse test result had fans and pundits questioning the legitimacy of Garcia’s performance against Haney, but King Ryan may not need to match that level to see off Barrios; with respect, the 30-year-old is seen as one of the weaker champions in boxing right now, and he enters Vegas on the back of two straight draws – one of which came against an aged Pacquiao. So, Garcia is the favourite on Saturday, and the question is whether he can live up to that status, after he failed to against Romero.\n\nIf he can, boxing may have a scintillating new rivalry: one between two admittedly-flawed fighters.\n\nFor Benn, Garcia represents a more-beatable opponent than Stevenson, and a more-marketable one than Barrios. In that way, a Garcia victory would be the perfect outcome for Benn this weekend.\n\nThere are other options out there for Benn, such as a clash with Northern Ireland’s Lewis Crocker for the IBF belt. However, the risk-reward ratio of that fight might not tip in the right direction for the “Destroyer”.\n\nIn truth, the profile of Benn’s opponents from here on out feels more important than their status; that is to say: Benn should share the ring with big names, whether or not they carry title belts.\n\nBut again, in Garcia, he might have encountered someone who can bring both. And so Benn will watch from ringside at T-Mobile Arena, it seems.\n\n“I don’t think he has a big presence in America, but I would be willing to go to the UK,” Garcia said of Benn in November. “I would definitely be willing to go to the UK to fight him. He seems like a fun match-up. He’s gonna come crazy and throw bombs all night and thinks he’s gonna overwhelm me, but he won’t.\n\n“But I would love to fight him. I love fighting Eddie Hearn’s fighters, I don’t know why, I just love to beat them up. He just makes you want to beat his fighters up. It’s just the way he talks, the way he moves, I can’t wait to look at his face and say: ‘I did it again.’\n\n“That would bring so much joy to me, almost more than a championship title. I would be ecstatic just to see Eddie's face, sad and confused. I beat Luke Campbell, Devin Haney – he was representing him, I beat him. I’m ready to beat up Conor now.”\n\nIn any case, Garcia must beat up Barrios. Then, fans will hope the road to Garcia vs Benn remains firm under the fighters’ feet. The press conferences would be engrossing, and the fight itself would be captivating. Yes, Garcia and Benn are flawed, but at this precise moment, they could make each other whole.\n\nEditor’s note: Friday brought the shock news that Benn is leaving Hearn’s promotional company, Matchroom, to join rivals Zuffa Boxing. Given Zuffa’s desire to move away from boxing’s traditional belt system, it is conceivable that Benn will soon lose his status as WBC mandatory challenger.",

    "description": "Justices Kavanaugh, Alito, and Thomas argued that Trump's tariffs were lawful and that reversing them could get messy.",
    "fullText": "Three conservative justices of the US Supreme Court — Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito — broke with the majority Friday, arguing that President Donald Trump had clear authority to impose his sweeping tariff policy.\n\nThe three dissenting justices said the president's tariffs were perfectly legal under the 1970-era law Trump used that says presidents can \"regulate\" importation in the case of emergencies.\n\n\"The tariffs at issue here may or may not be wise policy,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"But as a matter of text, history, and precedent, they are clearly lawful.\"\n\nThe three justices also noted that the majority 6-3 decision is silent on how to return billions of dollars in tariffs that have already been collected.\n\nThat process \"is likely to be a 'mess,'\" as was acknowledged at oral arguments, Kavanaugh wrote in a lengthy dissent that Thomas and Alito joined.\n\nThe two dissents differed with the majority on two fronts: Trump's bypassing of Congress in imposing tariffs, and the legality of the president's invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.\n\nIn the dissent written by Kavanaugh, the justices argued that presidents have \"commonly\" imposed tariffs to regulate imports throughout American history.\n\nInterpreting IEEPA to exclude tariffs \"creates nonsensical textual and practical anomalies,\" Kavanaugh wrote. As with quotas and embargoes, tariffs are a \"traditional and common tool to regulate importation,\" he said.\n\n\"It does not make much sense to think that IEEPA allows the President in a declared national emergency to, for example, shut off all or most imports from China, but not to impose even a $1 tariff on imports from China,\" Kavanaugh wrote.\n\nReversing the tariffs may be an exercise in futility, Kavanaugh added. Even without IEPPA, \"numerous other federal statutes authorize the president to impose tariffs and might justify most (if not all) of the tariffs at issue in this case,\" Kavanaugh wrote.\n\nIn a separate dissent, Thomas wrote that \"neither the statutory text\" of IEEPA \"nor the Constitution provide a basis for ruling against the President.\"\n\n\"This Court has consistently upheld Congress's delegation of power over foreign commerce, including the power to impose duties on imports,\" Thomas wrote. \"The Court has long conveyed to Congress that it may 'invest the President with large discretion in matters arising out of the execution of statutes relating to trade and commerce with other nations.'\"\n\nIn remarks at the White House following the Supreme Court's decision, Trump praised the three dissenting justices while bashing the others.\n\n\"I'd like to thank and congratulate Justices Thomas, Alito, and Kavanaugh for their strength and wisdom and love of our country, which is right now, very proud of those justices,\" Trump told reporters. \"When you read the dissenting opinions, there is no way that anyone can argue against them — there is no way.\"\n\nTrump called the Supreme Court ruling \"deeply disappointing\" and said he was \"ashamed of certain members of the court.\"",

    "description": "Our family went on an ultra-luxury Seabourn Ovation cruise to the Caribbean. Here's what the cheapest room was like and why it was a good value.",
    "fullText": "We traveled as a group of five: my mother, my brother and sister-in-law, their 7-year-old son, and me.\n\nIn total, we booked two entry-level suites — one for my mother and me, and another for my brother, sister-in-law, and their son — bringing the combined cruise fare to just over $20,000 for five people across 12 nights.\n\nThis figure includes accommodations, all meals, a selection of soft drinks and alcoholic beverages, and gratuities. We saved some money on my 7-year-old nephew's fare thanks to the cruise line's third-guest-at-half-price policy.\n\nOur suite measured 302 square feet, plus a 68-square-foot balcony.\n\nIts decor was pretty minimal, but it felt a bit elevated with accents of marble, dark wood, and glass.\n\nDespite being the cheapest option on the ship, this room felt more like it was part of a boutique hotel than just a standard cruise cabin.\n\nThe base-category suite felt thoughtfully laid out, with a seating area, a couch, a table, two beds, and a generously sized walk-in closet. Our clothes and bags easily fit inside with space to spare.\n\nIn the other suite, a sofa bed was set up as a dedicated sleeping space for my nephew.\n\nWe were delighted to find our room's minibar stocked with complimentary ginger beer, juices, and the spirits we requested prior to our sailing.\n\nTwice-daily housekeeping kept everything meticulously refreshed.\n\nSince all of our meals, standard beverages, and gratuities were included in the cost of the cruise fare, we didn't have to budget or crunch numbers during our trip.\n\nWe had most of our dinners in the ship's main dining room, which was so easy. It felt quite formal, and the rotating menus kept things interesting across the 12-night itinerary.\n\nPassengers also had access to The Patio, a poolside eatery with laid-back fare, and The Colonnade, a more casual spot serving buffet breakfasts and lunches, plus seated themed dinners.\n\nOptions for specialty dining included a sushi restaurant and a Mediterranean eatery called Solis, which was a standout for me.\n\nThe menu featured steak, lobster, and whole grilled fish deboned tableside. I particularly loved its post-dinner affogatos\n\nThe ship has a large main pool surrounded by lots of loungers, though we preferred the smaller hot tubs in other areas.\n\nQuieter spots, like the hot tub at the bow with incredible views of the ocean, quickly became our favorites.\n\nLocated on the top sundeck, The Retreat was my favorite area on the ship.\n\nThe space offered shaded cabanas, a noticeably calmer atmosphere than the main pool deck, and attentive, unhurried service.\n\nTo access it, passengers had to pay an additional $150 per day on port days or $250 on sea days.\n\nBooking it on sea days felt especially worthwhile. The quiet setting made it easy to relax or catch up on a bit of remote work on my laptop without feeling out of place.\n\nWe mostly booked excursions through the cruise line for peace of mind.\n\nOur favorite was in Saint Lucia, where a packed day included a catamaran ride, volcano hike, mud bath, and snorkeling.\n\nThe excursion ran late, but the ship waited for us as it had been booked through them.\n\nOn Saint Kitts, the crew arranged a private Christmas Day beach party with grilled lobster and drinks. Later, Santa Claus arrived by Jet Ski to serve caviar and Champagne in the surf.\n\nUltimately, our cruise averaged out to about $333 per person, per night. That felt surprisingly fair considering how much was included in our 12-night trip.\n\nWe also really enjoyed the ship's intimate size. Compared to other mega-ships carrying thousands of people, this 600-passenger vessel felt calm, navigable, and personal. We never felt overwhelmed by crowds, even on sea days.\n\nAlthough children aren't typically the target audience for ultra-luxury cruises, my nephew genuinely had a great time alongside the mostly older guests. His sailing also felt like a great value, considering he was charged half price as a third guest and still had his own proper bed.\n\nFor a multigenerational holiday trip that combined ease, variety, and consistent service, the value ultimately justified the price.\n\nAll in all, we enjoyed the trip enough to book another Seabourn voyage (at a discounted price) before disembarking.",

    "title": "Peacock's next growth bet: selling subscriptions for other streamers",
    "description": "Peacock has approached specialty streamers about selling subscriptions to complement its reality TV and sports-heavy programming.",
    "fullText": "Peacock's next growth bet isn't a blockbuster show or sports deal.\n\nNBCU's flagship streaming service is plotting to sell add-on subscriptions to other specialty streamers on its platform, four people familiar with the plans told Business Insider.\n\nPeacock has approached streamers about selling subscriptions to offer viewers content that complements its reality and sports-heavy line-up, these people said. Peacock expects to start with one streamer this year and is likely to limit the offering to a small number of partners.\n\nStarz, which already has multiple distribution partnerships, is one that's being considered, two insiders said. Starz declined to comment.\n\nTwo people briefed on Peacock's pitch saw it as a way for smaller streamers to reach new subscribers in a relatively uncluttered environment, and they hoped Peacock would eventually offer features such as the ability for streamers to offer free samples of their shows.\n\nThey described Peacock's terms as favorable compared to Amazon, which has a large business selling subscriptions to programmers big and small, from HBO Max to Crunchyroll. Amazon's channel terms vary by partner, but two partners told Business Insider in 2025 that Amazon's subscription revenue cut was over 50% in their deals.\n\nPeacock's plans come at a time when streaming services — especially outside market leaders Netflix and Disney — face pressure to consolidate as they look to continue growing their subscriber bases while remaining profitable. Overall, paid streaming growth in the US has cooled, while cancellation rates have risen in the wake of price hikes.\n\nTV viewership growth for streamers in the US is largely stagnant, and subscribers are navigating an increasingly complex landscape. Streaming services are trying tactics like discounts and bundling to keep people from leaving their platforms.\n\nSome other streaming platforms have adopted a marketplace approach that's broader than what Peacock is contemplating. Amazon is by far the leader. Last year, Amazon reported that its \"Channels\" program accounted for about 25% of US streamer sign-ups, citing Antenna data. Roku, YouTube, and device makers like Samsung and LG also let people \n\nPeacock, for its part, already sells add-on subscriptions to NBC Sports Regional Sports Networks, which it shares a corporate parent with. It also sells a bundle with Apple TV+ that involves cross-platform sampling and a discounted price.\n\nPeacock, with less than 2% of TV watch time in the US, has struggled to grow its share of the TV pie, according to Nielsen. That makes it the second-smallest of the subscription streamers Nielsen measures, ahead only of Warner Bros. Discovery (1.4%), which includes Discovery+ and HBO Max.\n\nUS-only Peacock also has relatively few subscribers, with about 44 million. Its nearest rival, Paramount+, has around 79 million global subscribers, and both are well behind Netflix, which is No. 1 with more than 325 million subscribers.\n\nStill, Peacock has far more subscribers than many specialty streamers. AMC Networks, for example, reported about 10 million subscribers across its portfolio of streamers, including AMC+, Acorn TV, and Shudder, as of the end of 2025.\n\n\"Peacock has been struggling,\" said Alan Wolk, a media industry analyst. \"There haven't been a whole lot of reasons to watch it, so giving people another reason to subscribe is a smart idea. If you ask consumers what's your biggest frustration with streamers, it's always, 'I can't find anything.' So the more you can put things together under one interface, the happier people will be.\"\n\nA global survey by Nielsen in November found more than 46% say it's harder to find the content they want to watch because there are too many streamers, rising to 51% in the US, with people spending 14 minutes searching for what to watch and 49% likely to cancel because they can't find something.\n\nThe survey also showed 66% of people expressed interest in a guide to present content information across all services.\n\nJames Faris contributed reporting.",

    "description": "I traveled the world as a digital nomad in places like Mexico City and Paris after a breakup. The experience taught me about my own resilience.",
    "fullText": "Three and a half years ago, I stood in my New Jersey apartment, surrounded by boxes I was about to put into storage. Tears streamed down my cheeks.\n\nI'd recently ended a two-year, live-in relationship. We loved each other deeply, but just weren't the right fit — and although the split was a gut-wrenching decision, we both knew it was the right move.\n\nI had just accepted a fully remote job, which allowed me to explore moving out of the New York City area — something I had been considering for about a year.\n\nI planned to just travel for a few months before settling down somewhere, but I ended up spending the next three years as a nomad.\n\nAlthough it wasn't quite what I'd pictured when I said goodbye to the apartment I shared with my ex, it turned into one of the most important chapters of my life.\n\nMy post-breakup plan was to put all of my belongings into a storage unit and spend a few months in Tulum.\n\nAfter that, I would travel to Miami and Los Angeles, \"interviewing\" both cities as candidates for a longer-term move. I was about seven months into this plan when I learned my role was going to be eliminated.\n\nLuckily, I was able to secure freelance work, so I decided to continue my travels since I wasn't needed in one particular place for my job.\n\nFrom Tulum, I headed to Mexico City. After just a few days, I fell in love with the food, vibrancy, people, and culture. My one-week vacation turned into an almost three-month stay.\n\nDuring my time in Mexico City, I explored art galleries and museums, learned some Spanish, made friends, went on dates, visited small shops, and tipped local people well.\n\nThese little moments helped me learn how adaptable I truly was. I realized I could make friends anywhere, stay disciplined with my work even while exploring a new place, safely navigate dating as a solo traveler, and be extremely resourceful.\n\nI kept exploring. I took the nomad life slowly, spending about four or five months abroad at a time in places like Paris, Lisbon, Málaga, London, Melbourne, Miami, and Tulum.\n\nBetween travels, I'd spend a few months recharging in a sublease (or a friend's apartment) in New York City.\n\nWhen traveling solo, every choice you make is yours, from where you eat to how you spend your days. I felt immensely grateful for this freedom — every day, it struck me how lucky I was to have every minuscule decision be solely my own.\n\nThat's not to say I felt lonely, though. With each new city and country I stayed in, I was delighted by the magic of connecting with strangers.\n\nOne time, I struck up a conversation with another woman at a particularly intense yoga class in Tulum. She was visiting from Canada, and we ended up spending a whole day together.\n\nI had another memorable experience in Europe. I had been traveling by myself for about three years at that point, and although it was incredible, I was exhausted. I felt ready to return to New York City, but I wasn't sure I could afford to do so.\n\nThen, one afternoon, my spirits were lifted when I found myself in a café in Paris, enjoying a chocolate-chip cookie and a latte. An older woman started chatting with me, and soon, another young woman traveling solo from Korea joined in.\n\nWe all shared stories and giggled as we sipped our coffees. As the older woman left the café, she said, \"You two girls exchange numbers now, and spend time together.\"\n\nWe laughed at the gentle demand, but wound up spending that evening — and the next day, too — exploring the city as a pair. I may or may not ever see her again, but she told me that if I ever visit Seoul, I'll be welcomed with open arms.\n\nI learned that not every place has to be a permanent home, and not every relationship has to last forever; in fact, some friendships might just last for the span of a trip.\n\nThe memories I made during this time will stick with me, though I've since emptied out my storage unit and settled into a one-year lease in New York City.\n\nMy nomadic chapter is closed for now, but my encounters with strangers, small moments in new cities, and solo time with myself left me changed for the better — and will surely inspire my next adventure.",

    "fullText": "NATO is deploying a Turkish drone carrier to the Baltic Sea to boost its surveillance and defense in response to \"repeated\" Russian airspace violations, the alliance announced on Friday.\n\nThe TCG Anadolu will support Eastern Sentry, a defensive operation the alliance launched in September after Russian drones crossed into Polish airspace, forcing a military response.\n\nThe Turkish drone carrier is deploying toward the coast of Latvia, where it will contribute to air surveillance and defense along NATO's eastern edge. Allies have been surging fighter jets and warships to the Baltic region in response to Russian drone incursions.\n\nAllied Joint Force Command Brunssum, one of three operational-level NATO headquarters, said in a statement on Friday that the deployment of the Anadolu follows \"repeated airspace violations\" that have been attributed to Russia.\n\nJFC Brunssum called the deployment \"a clear signal to the east\" and said that it \"sends an unmistakable message\" that NATO is prepared to defend its territory.\n\nIt's unclear when the carrier will arrive on station and how long it will remain there. The Turkish defense ministry could not immediately be reached for comment, and neither JFC Brunssum nor NATO's Allied Air Command responded to a request for additional information.\n\nThe first-of-its-kind TCG Anadolu is the Turkish Navy's only drone-carrying amphibious assault ship. It was commissioned in 2023 and is now Ankara's most advanced vessel and flagship.\n\nThe 750-foot-long vessel was originally intended to carry helicopters and F-35B fighter jets, but after Turkey was kicked out of the F-35 program over its purchase of Russian surface-to-air missile systems, Ankara decided to repurpose the Anadolu for fixed-wing drones.\n\nThe Anadolu can carry Bayraktar TB-3 and Bayraktar Kızılelma combat drones, systems made by the Turkish company Baykar, as well as attack helicopters.\n\nJFC Brunssum said the carrier is the largest ship in NATO's Steadfast Dart fleet, which is comprised of 17 vessels, including amphibious landing ships, frigates, destroyers, and submarines.\n\nIran and China have also built their own drone carriers, and Portugal expects to receive one later this year.",

    "title": "The battle over Trump tariff refunds is next — and it will be messy",
    "description": "The process for IEEPA tariff refunds will likely go through the Court of International Trade. Already, over 1,000 lawsuits are pending.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court on Friday overturned the centerpiece of President Donald Trump's tariff plans, ruling the federal government illegally collected over $133 billion in taxes from American businesses.\n\nNow comes the battle over refunds for tariffs paid, which Trump on Friday predicted could take years.\n\n\"I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years,\" he said at a White House press conference, while blasting the ruling as \"terrible\" and \"defective.\"\n\nUS Secretary of the Treasury went a step further, saying about refunds: \"I've got a feeling the American people won't see it.\"\n\nOne reason: Over 1,000 companies have filed lawsuits to claw back money from the government if the Supreme Court overturned Trump's tariffs justified by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nIn his dissenting opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh also predicted the process could become a \"mess,\" citing refund requests tallying \"billions of dollars to importers,\" even as some importers have already passed those costs to consumers.\n\nHere are all your questions about tariff refunds, answered by experts.\n\nTypically, the refund process would be handled by Customs and Border Protection, which collected the tariffs in the first place.\n\nIn order for that to happen, the Trump administration would need to establish a process for handling refund requests. The White House, which didn't return Business Insider's request for comment, has yet to signal plans to do this, said Rachel Brewster, a professor of international trade at Duke Law School.\n\nWithout a formal process in place, claims will be litigated in the Court of International Trade, which will order CPB to issue refunds to specific companies, Brewster said.\n\nIn the past, the Court of International Trade has ordered refunds when it has found particular taxes to be invalid — albeit on a smaller scale, according to Daniel Mach, a commercial litigator at Bryan Cave.\n\nIt'll likely turn to the process that followed a 1998 Supreme Court decision to overturn a harbor maintenance tax, which also resulted in refunds, Mach said.\n\n\"It's been a while,\" Mach said. \"Everyone's going to be kind of figuring out the ropes as they go. But at the end of the day, it's not an unsolvable problem.\"\n\nGiven the number of claims, the Court of International Trade is likely to appoint an administrator or special master to consider each of them, rather than handling the lawsuits piecemeal, Mach said.\n\nGroups that advocated for the Supreme Court to overturn the IEEPA tariffs have urged the Court of International Trade to develop a smooth process for refunds.\n\n\"The refunds will serve as an economic boost and allow companies to reinvest in their operations, their employees and their customers,\" said David French, an executive at the National Retail Federation, in a statement.\n\nThe whole refund process — whether through CPB or through a class-action or administrative processes in court — could take up to two years, according to Brewster.\n\nYes! The cases that went to the Supreme Court were groups of small companies, including a wine importer and an educational toy retailer. But several massive corporations, including Toyota and Costco, have also filed refund lawsuits.\n\nYou can try to get a refund for personal orders hit by tariffs, but it'll be complicated.\n\nIn asking CPB or a court for a refund, you'll have to distinguish tariffs you paid pursuant to IEEPA, which were overturned, and the tariffs justified by other laws, which remain on the books.\n\nIndividual lawsuits for IEEPA tariffs on individual retailer orders, like from Temu and Shein, likely won't be worthwhile. The legal fees would likely exceed any potential refund. But it's possible that some enterprising litigators would put together a class-action lawsuit to make it worthwhile, Brewster predicted.\n\n\"It was an illegally imposed tax,\" she said. \"So in theory, everyone is entitled to a refund.\"\n\nWith reporting by Brent Griffins",

The AI infrastructure stock has battled high volatility lately, though it's up about 19% year to date.\n\nWhy: CoreWeave's decline on Friday comes after a report from Business Insider that said Blue Owl Capital was unable to arrange debt financing for a data center it's co-developing that is expected to be occupied by CoreWeave.\n\nBusiness Insider's Dan Geiger reports that a debt arranger for major data center deals said that the project, located in Pennsylvania, failed to attract interest because lenders are reluctant to add exposure to AI firms with below-investment-grade credit. CoreWeave debt is rated B+ by S&P Global Ratings, several notches below investment grade.\n\nWhat it means: Despite being backed by Nvidia, CoreWeave has faced skepticism from finance pros who have wondered about the sustainability of the business model of renting out compute to AI customers.\n\nThe company's high debt-to-equity ratio and its AI-dependent business model have been red flags for some investors, particularly as AI enthusiasm has waned somewhat in the last six months.\n\nIn October, CoreWeave's attempted merger with Core Scientific fell through after Trip Miller, the founder of the investment firm Gullane Capital and Core Scientific's third-largest shareholder, announced he would vote against it.\n\nFamed short-seller Jim Chanos has also raised concerns about CoreWeave, highlighting problems he sees with its financials and profitability, and warning investors against owning data center stocks.\n\nBlue Owl, meanwhile, was already in the spotlight this week for reportedly halting redepmtions on one of its private credit funds offered to retail investors.",

    "description": "The US Supreme Court ruled against some of Trump's tariffs on Friday. Jefferies analysts highlighted five stocks that are set to gain on the news.",
    "fullText": "Wall Street is weighing the impact of the US Supreme Court ruling against Trump's tariffs, with investors on the hunt for stocks that stand to gain the most from the reversal of the landmark trade policy.\n\nSCOTUS ruled that Trump can't use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify tariffs. Following the announcement, Jefferies analysts highlighted five stocks that they say have the \"largest upside benefit\" on the court's decision.\n\n\"The removal of IEEPA tariffs introduces a meaningful margin tailwind across our consumer discretionary coverage,\" the analysts wrote.\n\n\"While the ruling eliminates the legal authority for these tariffs, questions remain around remedies—most notably whether companies will be entitled to refunds for duties already paid,\" they added.\n\nHere are five stocks that Jefferies sees as best-positioned to gain after the SCOTUS tariff decision.\n\nJefferies analysts said Signet Jewelers is a primary beneficiary of the tariff decision.\n\nThe company sources roughly half of its inventory from India since the country is a global hub for both natural and lab-grown diamonds.\n\nWith the SCOTUS ruling, Signet Jewelers' weighted‑average tariff exposure falls to 0% from 15.1%, creating an opportunity for margin expansion and earnings growth, Jefferies analysts wrote.\n\nPrior to the SCOTUS ruling, Yeti had a nearly 15% exposure to tariff-related sources, concentrated in its US revenue.\n\nThe company told investors there was a $0.35 earning per share impact from the IEEPA tariffs, meaning that the decision will eliminate tariff pressures going forward.\n\nSharkninja proactively mitigated tariff impact by diversifying its supply chain, supply concessions, strategic pricing, and promotions.\n\nEven with these efforts, the company still saw tariff-related margin headwinds.\n\nSCOTUS's decision will turn this pressure into a benefit for the company, as the already successful operational shifts, along with the removal of the tariffs, will further boost earnings.\n\nNike embedded a 7.7% tariff exposure into its fiscal 2026 guidance. This would have amounted to a $1.5 billion cost for the athletic wear company.\n\n\"The elimination of IEEPA tariffs now flips this dynamic into a margin tailwind, supporting incremental gross margin expansion through FY26,\" Jefferies wrote.\n\nBirkenstock worked a nearly 7% weighted‑average tariff impact into their guidance.\n\nThe SCOTUS news turns the margin headwind into a tailwind to fuel outperformance compared to the company's outlook, Jefferies said.",

    "title": "From Section 122 on down, Trump readies his new tariff toolkit",
    "description": "The Supreme Court blocked Trump's IEEPA tariffs, but he has other ways to impose sweeping duties — some of which are already being dusted off.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court on Friday knocked down President Donald Trump's controversial tariffs, ruling that the president overstepped his authority by relying on a law normally reserved for emergencies.\n\nThe high court ruling, however, only curbed the president's most flexible tool for reshaping global trade. Taxing imports is central to Trump's economic policy, and the president indicated on Friday that the White House has plenty of other options for imposing taxes on imported goods — some of which they are already dusting off.\n\n\"We have very powerful alternatives,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday as he bashed the Supreme Court's ruling.\n\nHere's a rundown of options the Trump administration could turn to next, starting with a new 10% global tariff that the White House announced on Friday.\n\nTrump can use other laws to impose duties on goods from other countries, including Sections 122 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act.\n\nOn Friday, Trump mentioned all of these laws as viable alternatives to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, which the Supreme Court ruled was not intended for tariffs.\n\n\"Effective immediately, all national security tariffs under Section 232, and existing Section 301 tariffs — they're existing, they're there — remain in place, fully in place, and in full force and effect,\" Trump said.\n\nHe added, \"Today, I will sign an order to impose a 10% global tariff under Section 122, over and above our normal tariffs already being charged.\"\n\nTrump also said his administration was \"initiating several Section 301, and other investigations, to protect our country from unfair trading practices of other countries and companies.\"\n\nSection 301 allows the United States to place tariffs on goods from particular countries if they \"either violated international trade law or otherwise acted unfairly,\" according to Rachel Brewster, a professor of international trade at Duke Law School.\n\nIt's a \"broad standard\" that can work to Trump's benefit, Brewster said. And because the law includes provisions that allow the president to form trade deals with other countries to resolve the unfair trade practices, the deals Trump already struck after imposing IEEPA tariffs could likely be \"folded into\" Section 301, Brewster said.\n\nSection 232, on the other hand, allows the president to impose tariffs on particular goods they deem a national security threat, across all countries. Trump has already used the law broadly — he's applied it to everything from aluminum to bathroom vanities.\n\nSection 122 is a blunt instrument, allowing a blanket tariff of up to 15% on all imports from all countries for up to 150 days. The law is meant to address a \"balance of payments\" imbalance, and it's possible Trump could use it as a stopgap measure, according to Brewster.\n\nBefore Trump, no president tried to use the IEEPA to impose tariffs. The 1970s-era national security law says that, in case of emergencies, presidents can \"regulate\" importation.\n\nIt's the law he used to justify his April \"Liberation Day\" tariffs of at least 10% on every country in the world, a 125% tariff on imports from China, and a tariff on any country that imported oil from Venezuela.\n\nIn a 6-3 ruling released on Friday, the highest court in the land said that Trump overstepped his authority by using the IEEPA to impose taxes on imported goods.\n\n\"IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs,\" the ruling said.\n\nOne benefit of using Section 301 and Section 232 is that they have already proven legally durable.\n\nTrump used Section 301 in his trade war against China during his first term. Joe Biden, during his presidency, renewed the tariffs and expanded them by imposing additional duties on electric vehicles and solar panel components.\n\nImporters have challenged the tariffs brought under Section 301 and Section 232. So far, they haven't been successful, according to Kathleen Claussen, an international trade arbitrator and professor at Georgetown Law. Courts have ruled in favor of the government on all sorts of legal questions, from whether Trump had the power to bring the tariffs at all, to whether he followed the right process to add or modify particular products that were subject to tariffs.\n\n\"Big picture questions down to small, detailed nuances — those were all tested back in Trump One,\" Claussen told Business Insider.\n\nThe downside of both Section 301 and Section 232 is that each requires investigations from federal agencies to establish the tariffs, which can take months.\n\nA typical Section 301 United States Trade Representative investigation — to determine whether another country truly acted unfairly, and how high the duties should be in response — usually takes six months, Brewster said.\n\nBut the Trump administration can move quickly if it wants to, Claussen said. It can skip procedural steps, like convening a private sector committee or holding hearings.\n\n\"I do think people who think we're talking about, 'Oh, this is going to take a couple of months for them to stand up 301 — I don't think it will take that long,\" Claussen said.\n\nTrump could also dust off Section 338, a law passed during the Great Depression that has never been used to impose tariffs. The law allows duties of up to 50% for goods from specific countries that \"discriminate\" against US exports.\n\nThe law's language is broad and \"squishy,\" Claussen said, and it could be vulnerable to legal challenges. But it's possible the Trump administration would use it anyway.\n\n\"There's no question in my mind that the government is preparing all possible tools and options for the president,\" Claussen said. \"That's what you would imagine that they should be doing. So I would think that they are considering 338, I would think that they're considering 122 and just sort of teeing anything up so the president can choose what he thinks most appropriate.\"",

She had worked at OpenAI for three years prior. Before that, she worked for 10 years on security at Apple, her profile says.\n\nOther employees rejoined OpenAI last month. Two co-founders, former CTO Barret Zoph and Luke Metz, both left, along with researcher Sam Schoenholz.\n\nLia Guy, another researcher, also rejoined OpenAI, The Information reported. Another cofounder, Andrew Tulloch, left for Meta late last year, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nOpenAI and Thinking Machines Lab declined to comment.\n\nThinking Machines Lab raised a monster $2 billion funding round last year, valuing the company at $12 billion, spokespeople said at the time. The startup launched its first product, Tinker, last October.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company has become known for attracting star-studded talent. It quietly hired Neal Wu, a legendary coder who won three gold medals in an Olympiad for programming, and Soumith Chintala, the creator of the open-source AI project PyTorch at Meta, who is now Thinking Machines Lab's CTO, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Microsoft named Asha Sharma, an executive in its CoreAI group, as Phil Spencer's replacement as the CEO of Microsoft Gaming.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer is retiring, according to an email to employees. Microsoft executive Asha Sharma will become the new executive vice president and CEO of Microsoft Gaming, reporting directly to Nadella.\n\n\"Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in the email.\n\n\"He expanded our reach across PC, mobile, and cloud; nearly tripled the size of the business; helped shape our strategy through the acquisitions of Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax, and Minecraft; and strengthened our culture across our studios and platforms,\" Nadella wrote.\n\nSpencer's departure marks the end of an era for Xbox. Under Spencer, Microsoft transformed gaming into a subscription- and services-driven business and completed the largest acquisition in its history, paying $69 billion for Activision Blizzard.\n\nSharma joined Microsoft in 2024 and has worked in the CoreAI group under Jay Parikh. She was previously a chief operating Officer at Instacart and a vice president of product and engineering at Meta before that.\n\nXbox's president and chief operations officer, Sarah Bond, is leaving the company, while longtime Microsoft gaming executive Matt Booty will become executive vice president and chief content officer, reporting to Sharma.\n\nGaming has been part of Microsoft from the start. Flight Simulator shipped before Windows, and you can practically ray‑trace a line from DirectX in the '90s to the accelerated‑compute era we're in today.\n\nAs we celebrate Xbox's 25th year, the opportunity and innovation agenda in front of us is expansive. Today we reach over 500 million monthly active users, are a top publisher across all platforms, and continue to innovate across gaming hardware, content and community, in service of creators and players everywhere.\n\nI am long on gaming and its role at the center of our consumer ambition, and as we look ahead, I'm excited to share that Asha Sharma will become Executive Vice President and CEO, Microsoft Gaming, reporting to me. Over the last two years at Microsoft, and previously as Chief Operating Officer at Instacart and a Vice President at Meta, Asha has helped build and scale services that reach billions of people and support thriving consumer and developer ecosystems. She brings deep experience building and growing platforms, aligning business models to long-term value, and operating at global scale, which will be critical in leading our gaming business into its next era of growth.\n\nMatt Booty will become Executive Vice President and Chief Content Officer, reporting to Asha. Matt's career reflects a lifelong commitment to games and to the people who make them. Under his leadership, Microsoft Gaming has grown to span nearly 40 studios across Xbox, Bethesda, Activision Blizzard, and King, which are home to beloved franchises including Halo, The Elder Scrolls, Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Candy Crush, and Fallout.\n\nTogether, Asha and Matt have the right combination of consumer product leadership and gaming depth to push our platform innovation and content pipeline forward. Last year, Phil Spencer made the decision to retire from the company, and since then we've been talking about succession planning. I want to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership and partnership. Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it. He expanded our reach across PC, mobile, and cloud; nearly tripled the size of the business; helped shape our strategy through the acquisitions of Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax, and Minecraft; and strengthened our culture across our studios and platforms. I've long admired Phil's unwavering commitment to players, creators, and his team, and I am personally grateful for his leadership and counsel. He will continue working closely with Asha to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nWe have extraordinary creative talent across our studios and a global platform that is second to none. I'm excited for how we will capture the opportunity ahead and define what comes next, while staying grounded in what players and creators value.\n\nPlease join me in congratulating Asha and Matt on their new roles, and in thanking Phil for everything he has done for Microsoft and for our industry.\n\nWhen I walked through Microsoft's doors as an intern in June of 1988, I could never have imagined the products I'd help build, the players and customers we'd serve, or the extraordinary teams I'd be lucky enough to join. It's been an epic ride and truly the privilege of a lifetime.\n\nLast fall, I shared with Satya that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life. From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we've built. Xbox has always been more than a business. It's a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead.\n\nToday marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team. Working with her over the past several months has given me tremendous confidence. She brings genuine curiosity, clarity and a deep commitment to understanding players, creators, and the decisions that shape our future. We know this is an important moment for our fans, partners, and team, and we're committed to getting it right. I'll remain in an advisory role through the summer to support a smooth handoff.\n\nI'm also grateful for the strength of our studios organization. Matt Booty and our studios teams continue to build an incredible portfolio, and I have full confidence in the leadership and creative momentum across our global studios. I want to congratulate Matt on his promotion to EVP and Chief Content Officer.\n\nAs part of this transition, Sarah Bond has decided to leave Microsoft to begin a new chapter. Sarah has been instrumental during a defining period for Xbox, shaping our platform strategy, expanding Game Pass and cloud gaming, supporting new hardware launches, and guiding some of the most significant moments in our history. I'm grateful for her partnership and the impact she's had, and I wish her the very best in what comes next.\n\nMost of all, to everyone in Microsoft Gaming, I want to say \"thank you\". I've learned so much from this team and community, grown alongside you, and been continually inspired by the creativity, courage, and care you bring to players, creators, and to one another every day.\n\nI'm incredibly proud of what we've built together over the last 25 years, and I have complete confidence in all of you and in the opportunities ahead. I'll be cheering you on in this next chapter as Xbox's proudest fan and player.\n\nToday I begin my role as CEO of Microsoft Gaming.\n\nI feel two things at once: humility and urgency.\n\nHumility because this team has built something extraordinary over decades. Urgency because gaming is in a period of rapid change, and we need to move with clarity and conviction.\n\nI am stepping into work shaped by generations of artists, engineers, designers, writers, musicians, operators and more who create worlds that have brought joy and deep personal meaning to hundreds of millions of players. The level of craft here is exceptional, and it is amplified by Xbox, which was founded in the belief that the power of games connect people and push the industry forward.\n\nThank you to Phil for his leadership, and to every studio, platform, and operations team that built this foundation. We are stewards of some of the most loved stories and characters in entertainment and bring players and creators together around the fun and community of gaming in entirely new ways.\n\nMy first job is simple: understand what makes this work and protect it.\n\nThat starts with three commitments.\n\nEverything begins here. We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything. Unforgettable characters, stories that make us feel, innovative game play, and creative excellence. We will empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas. We will take risks. We will enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most.\n\nI promoted Matt Booty in honor of this commitment. He understands the craft and the challenges of building great games, has led teams that deliver award-winning work, and has earned the trust of game developers across the industry.\n\nWe will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world.\n\nWe will celebrate our roots with a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console which has shaped who we are. It connects us to the players and fans who invest in Xbox, and to the developers who build ambitious experiences for it.\n\nGaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware. As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise.\n\nWe are witnessing the reinvention of play.\n\nTo meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters, and worlds that people love. But we will not treat those worlds as static IP to milk and monetize. We will build a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories.\n\nAs monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.\n\nThe next 25 years belong to the teams who dare to build something surprising, something no one else is willing to try, and have the patience to see it through. We have done this before, and I am here to help us do it again. I want to return to the renegade spirit that built Xbox in the first place. It will require us to relentlessly question everything, revisit processes, protect what works, and be brave enough to change what does not.\n\nThank you for welcoming me into this journey.\n\nI read Phil's note with much gratitude. He has been a steady champion for game creators and our studio teams, and I've learned so much from his leadership over the years. All our games have benefited from his foundational support. I'm also grateful to Satya for his ongoing commitment to gaming and holding a vision of how it can connect back to the larger company.\n\nLooking forward, I'm excited to partner with Asha as our next CEO. Our first conversations centered on her commitment to making great games and the role that plays in our overall success. She asks questions, pushes for clarity, and wants our choices grounded in player and developer needs. That mindset matters as the industry around us is changing quickly: how players engage, how games are made, and how business models and platforms evolve.\n\nWe have good reasons to believe in what's ahead. This organization and its franchises have navigated change for decades, and our strength comes from teams who know how to adapt and keep delivering. That confidence is grounded in a strong pipeline of established franchises, new bets we believe in, and clear player demand for what we are building.\n\nMy focus is on supporting the teams and leaders we have in place and creating the conditions for them to do their best work. To be clear, there are no organizational changes underway for our studios.\n\nThanks for everything you do for players and for each other.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "A 6-3 majority struck down one of President Donald Trump's favored methods to impose tariffs.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump lashed out at the Supreme Court after justices dealt a sweeping rebuke of his trade policy.\n\nIn some of his harshest criticisms ever of the nation's highest court, Trump said some justices should be \"absolutely ashamed\" for siding against him. Without evidence, Trump accused justices of being \"swayed by foreign interests.\" He added that the majority opinion was \"almost like not written by smart people.\"\n\n\"Others think they're being politically correct, which has happened before far too often with members of this court,\" he said. \"They are just being fools and lapdogs for the RINOS and radical left Democrats.\"\n\nTrump said that it was fair to question the loyalty of \"our people,\" a likely reference to his two appointees, Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch, who sided against the administration's view.\n\nTrump said that due to the \"deeply disappointing\" decision, \"alternatives\" will be used to preserve his trade agenda. Later, he said he would use a separate authority to impose a 10% global tariff on top of any existing tariffs.\n\n\"The Supreme Court did not overrule tariffs. They merely overruled a particular use of IEPPA tariffs,\" Trump said, citing the law in question in the court's ruling.\n\nA White House official later said that countries being tariffed under the authority the Supreme Court struck down will now be subject to the 10% tariff.\n\n\"With IEEPA no longer applicable, those countries will now be tariffed at the global 10% tariff using the Section 122 legal authority,\" the official said in a statement to Business Insider. \"This is, however, only temporary as the Administration will be pursuing other legal authorities to implement more appropriate or pre-negotiated tariff rates.\"\n\nLeft unclear is what the administration will do in the long term.\n\nSection 122 tariffs, which Trump said he would use for a global tariff, can only be imposed for 150 days. After that, Congress must vote to extend. It's unclear if such a vote could pass just months before the midterm elections.\n\nAsked if the government will now have to issue refunds, Trump again criticized the court for not addressing the issue.\n\n\"I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years,\" he said.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that Trump did not have the power under a 1970s law to unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs as he did in April 2025 during \"Liberation Day.\" The ruling does not invalidate all of Trump's tariffs, as other tariffs were imposed under different authorities. It does mean that Trump is significantly more limited in imposing broad, general tariffs against countries, one of his preferred methods in trade negotiations.\n\n\"The President must 'point to clear congressional authorization' to justify his extraordinary assertion to justify his extraordinary assertion of the power to impose tariffs,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion. \"He cannot.\"\n\nTrump, who has repeatedly proclaimed himself to be \"Tariff Man,\" has also repeatedly suggested that he would use revenue from tariffs to pay for a range of things, from refund checks to paying down the national debt to helping fund childcare.\n\nIn total, Treasury Department data showed that the US has collected more than $133 billion in tariffs as of December.\n\nThe White House and top Trump administration officials have repeatedly suggested that if the court struck down most of Trump's tariffs that it would be a mess to sort out any potential refund process.\n\n\"It won't be a problem if we have to do it, but I can tell you that if it happens - which I don't think it's going to - it's just a corporate boondoggle,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently told Reuters. \"Costco, who's suing the US government, are they going to give the money back to their clients?\"\n\nRoberts' opinion did not explicitly address a potential refund process, a point that Justice Brett Kavanaugh seized on in his 63-page dissent.\n\n\"The Court says nothing today about whether, and if so how, the Government should go about returning the billions of dollars that it has collected from importers,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"But that process is likely to be a 'mess,' as was acknowledged at oral argument.\"\n\nIn addition to criticizing the justices in the majority, Trump offered effusive praise for Kavanaugh, who wrote a 63-page dissenting opinion.\n\n\"I'm so proud of him,\" Trump said, suggesting Kavanaugh's stock has \"gone way up.\"\n\nThis is unlikely to be Trump's last word on the soon-to-be historic ruling. On Tuesday, he is set to deliver his annual State of the Union address.\n\nHistorically, the justices occupy front-row seats on the House floor.",

    "description": "Govs. Gavin Newsom and JB Pritzker demand Trump pay Americans $1,700 in tariff refunds after the Supreme Court ruling.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump previously promised Americans tariff dividend checks, but if Democrats have their way, he could be issuing refunds instead.\n\nAfter a Supreme Court ruling on Friday struck down Trump's tariffs levied under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Democratic lawmakers were quick to demand that the president repay Americans through tariff refunds.\n\n\"Donald Trump should return that money immediately. He has an obligation,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said on Friday. \"$1,751 per family that were taxed by Donald Trump. He took hundreds of billions of dollars from working folks, from the ag community, from small businesses for this vanity play, this illegal action, and he finally was held to account. The rule of law won out.\"\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker sent a letter to Trump calling for refunds to families in his state.\n\n\"Your tariff taxes wreaked havoc on farmers, enrage our allies, and sent grocery store prices through the roof,\" Pritzker said in the letter. \"On behalf of the people of Illinois, I demand a refund of $1,700 for every family in Illinois.\"\n\nThe governor also sent an invoice billing that amount for more than 5.1 million Illinois families, totaling more than $8.6 billion. The invoice said it was \"PAST DUE - DELINQUENT.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment, White House spokesman Kush Desai responded in part by saying if Pritzker \"really cared about delivering economic relief for Illinois, he'd start with his own state government instead of chasing another stupid headline.\"\n\nThe offices of Newsom and Pritzker did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBoth Newsom and Pritzker are considered potential candidates for the presidential election in 2028, and they've both been highly critical of Trump.\n\nThe governors appeared to be basing their requests for refunds of that amount on a report released this month by Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee in Congress. The report found American families paid an average of $1,745 in tariff costs between February 2025 and January 2026, for a total of over $231 billion paid by consumers.\n\nOther studies, including from Harvard Business School and The Budget Lab at Yale, have found that tariff costs are largely paid by American businesses and consumers.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday ruled that tariffs issued under the IEEPA, a national security act, had exceeded the president's authority. Trump denounced the decision and said he would pursue additional tariffs through other avenues.\n\nIn November, Trump touted the money being collected from tariffs and floated the idea of sending $2,000 tariff dividend checks to middle and low-income Americans, though issuing such checks would likely have required an act of Congress. In January, Trump gave mixed messages about his plans for tariff rebate checks.\n\nNow, with the IEEPA tariffs struck down, it's likely some American businesses will try to receive refunds for the tariff costs they paid.\n\nDespite Democrats' stance on the issue, there's a lot of uncertainty about whether or how refunds would happen.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling did not touch on issuing tariff refunds.\n\nWhen Trump was asked Friday if the government would now have to issue refunds, he said, \"I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years.\"\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Friday it was \"unlikely\" Americans would receive tariff refunds.\n\n\"I got a feeling the American people won't see it,\" Bessent said, adding, \"My sense is that could be dragged out for weeks, months, years.\"",

    "description": "In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court upended President Donald Trump's trade agenda and left many major questions unanswered.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump issued a stinging rebuke of the Supreme Court for striking down most of his tariffs.\n\n\"Others think they're being politically correct, which has happened before far too often with members of this court,\" Trump said. \"They are just being fools and lapdogs for the RINOS and radical left Democrats.\"\n\nTrump vowed to press on with his trade agenda, starting with a sweeping 10% global tariff that will be in addition to any existing tariffs. The president has other avenues to impose tariffs, including through Section 232.\n\nWhile he criticized the justices who sided against him, Trump lavished praise on the three who dissented, Brett Kavanaugh, Samuel Alito, and Clarence Thomas.\n\n\"I would like to thank Justice Kavanaugh for, frankly, his genius and his great ability,\" Trump said.\n\nWedbush's Dan Ives said the ruling could be a \"net positive\" for tech companies if refunds are issued.\n\n\"With ~$133.5 billion in tariff revenue up for grabs if the US tariff ruling leads to refunds for organizations, we believe this would act as a net positive for tech with financial relief for many companies while creating greater supply chain visibility especially coming from the Asia supply chain,\" Ives wrote in a note. \"This will be a very noisy situation but for the tech space and AI trade it's a net positive out of the gates in our view.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts' ruling did not explicitly address what companies that paid the now-invalidated tariffs may be entitled to.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent lamented the ruling, adding that it was \"unlikely\" Americans will ever see tariff refunds.\n\n\"I got a feeling the American people won't see it,\" Bessent said during a speech before the Economic Club of Dallas.\n\nLike Trump, Bessent noted the administration has other alternatives to impose tariffs. He also echoed the president's point that it may take years to sort out any potential refunds.\n\n\"My sense is that could be dragged out for weeks, months, years,\" Bessent said about the coming court fights.\n\nJefferies analysts said five consumer stocks are poised to get a big boost on the heels of the ruling.\n\nThe firm's analysts said Signet Jewelers, Yeti, Sharkninja, Nike, and Birkenstock are all set to gain do to \"a meaningful margin tailwind.\"\n\nRaymond James Washington Policy Analyst Ed Mills said he expects any sort of refund process to be \"lengthy and challenging.\"\n\n\"We expect that the process for firms to receive tariff refunds will be lengthy and challenging, with litigants needing to bring individual cases or participate in class action (vs. automatic refunds),\" Mills wrote in a note.\n\nMills added that Costco and other firms have sued to ensure their claims are not invalidated by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's deadline for disputing tariff bills. Costco's case remains ongoing.\n\nFormer Deputy Director of the National Economic Council Bharat Ramamurti said \"rational businesses\" should understand that tariffs aren't going away.\n\n\"The point is that any rational US business is going to anticipate the possibility of new tariffs, which is going to: (a) deter them from passing along any short-term cost savings to consumers; and (b) continue to fuel the uncertainty that is putting a damper on certain forms of business investment in the US,\" Ramamurti wrote in a post on Substack.\n\nThe short-term economic impact is unclear, Ramamurti wrote, because the court's opinion did not address major issues like potential refunds.\n\nOn the topic of refunds, Erica York, the vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, said it should actually be quite easy for the Trump administration to issue refunds.\n\n\"The IEEPA tariffs have brought in around $160 billion in tariff payments. For context, the IRS refunds taxpayers more than $300 billion in income tax overpayments each year,\" York wrote on X. \"Refunding tariff payments to the importer of record should follow a similar, straightforward process.\"\n\nInvestor Jason Calacanis said the court's ruling shows why Trump needs to work with Congress to impose tariffs.\n\n\"MAGA and AFAO loyalists will lose their minds when President @AOC and VP @ZohranKMamdani start using 'emergency powers' to shape their socialist agenda,\" Calacanis wrote on X. \"This is why the Founding Fathers limited executive power and balanced the branches of government.\"\n\nWhile often supportive of Trump, Calacanis and others in the business and tech space have expressed skepticism of Trump's sweeping tariffs.\n\nThe US Chamber of Commerce and the National Retail Federation hailed the court's decision.\n\n\"Swift refunds of the impermissible tariffs will be meaningful for the more than 200,000 small business importers in this country and will help support stronger economic growth this year,\" Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement.\n\nThe National Retail Federation called on a lower court \"to ensure a seamless process to refund the tariffs.\"\n\n\"The refunds will serve as an economic boost and allow companies to reinvest in their operations, their employees and their customers,\" David French, executive vice president of government relations, said in a statement.\n\nCanadian Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc said the decision \"strengthens\" his country's view that Trump's emergency tariffs were \"unjustified.\"\n\n\"Although Canada has concluded the best trade agreement with the United States among all its trading partners, we recognize that there is still much to be done to support Canadian businesses and workers who continue to be affected by the tariffs imposed under Section 232 on the steel, aluminum, and automotive sectors,\" LeBlance wrote in a post on X.\n\nNotably, Section 232 tariffs are not included in Friday's ruling, underscoring that Trump still has additional tools at his disposal for his trade policy.\n\nVice President JD Vance called the decision \"lawlessness from the Court.\"\n\n\"Today, the Supreme Court decided that Congress, despite giving the president the ability to 'regulate imports,' didn't actually mean it,\" Vance wrote in a post on X. \"This is lawlessness from the Court, plain and simple. And its only effect will be to make it harder for the president to protect American industries and supply chain resiliency.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson said Republicans would find a way forward after the setback.\n\n\"No one can deny that the President's use of tariffs has brought in billions of dollars and created immense leverage for America's trade strategy and for securing strong, reciprocal America-first trade agreements with countries that had been taking advantage of American workers for decades,\" Johnson said in a statement posted on X. \"Congress and the Administration will determine the best path forward in the coming weeks.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries took a victory lap after the ruling.\n\n\"Donald Trump's failed economic policies and global trade war waged with irresponsible, on-again, off-again tariffs on our allies and trading partners have generated massive uncertainty, threatened the economic well-being of the American people and damaged our country's standing around the world,\" Jeffries said in a statement.\n\nThe Top House Democrat said his party will \"push back aggressively in Congress\" on Trump's tariffs.\n\nDespite being in the minority, all but one House Democrat recently joined with six Republicans to approve a largely symbolic rebuke of Trump's emergency tariffs on Canada. It was unclear if the resolution would have passed in the Senate. Trump was widely expected to veto it if it arrived on his desk.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled on Friday that Trump lacked the power to impose such tariffs on Canada.\n\nCorrection: February 20, 2026 — An earlier version of this story misspelled Hakeem Jeffries' name.",

    "title": "Here's Why You Should Never Use AI to Generate Your Passwords",
    "description": "ChatGPT isn't good at generating secure passwords.",
    "fullText": "I'm a bit of a broken record when it comes to personal security on the internet: Make strong passwords for each account; never reuse any passwords; and With these three steps combined, your general security is pretty much set. But how you make those passwords matters just as much as making each strong and unique. As such, please don't use an AI program to generate your passwords.\n\nIf you're a fan of chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini, it might seem like a no-brainer to ask the AI to generate passwords for you. You might like how they handle other tasks for you, so it might make sense that something seemingly so high-tech yet accessible could produce secure passwords for your accounts. But LLMs (large language models) are not necessarily good at everything, and creating good passwords just so happens to be among those faults.\n\nAs highlighted by Malwarebytes Labs, researchers recently investigated AI-generated passwords, and evaluated their security. In short? The findings aren't good. Researchers tested password generation across ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, and discovered that the passwords were \"highly predictable\" and \"not truly random.\" Claude, in particular, didn't fare well: Out of 50 prompts, the bot was only able to generate 23 unique passwords. Claude gave the same password as an answer 10 times. The Register reports that researchers found similar flaws with AI systems like GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 3 Pro, and even Nano Banana Pro. (Gemini 3 Pro even warned the passwords shouldn't be used for \"sensitive accounts.\")\n\nThe thing is, these results seem good on the surface. They look uncrackable because they're a mix of numbers, letters, and special characters, and password strength identifiers might say they're secure. But these generations are inherently flawed, whether that's because they are repeated results, or come with a recognizable pattern. Researchers evaluated the \"entropy\" of these passwords, or the measure of unpredictability, with both \"character statistics\" and \"log probabilities.\" If that all sounds technical, the important thing to note is that the results showed entropies of 27 bits and 20 bits, respectively. Character statistics tests look for entropy of 98 bits, while log probabilities estimates look for 120 bits. You don't need to be an expert in password entropy to know that's a massive gap.\n\nHackers can use these limitations to their advantage. Bad actors can run the same prompts as researchers (or, presumably, end users) and collect the results into a bank of common passwords. If chatbots repeat passwords in their generations, it stands to reason that many people might be using the same passwords generated by those chatbots—or trying passwords that follow the same pattern. If so, hackers could simply try those passwords during break-in attempts, and if you used an LLM to generate your password, it might match. It's tough to say what that exact risk is, but to be truly secure, each of your passwords should be totally unique. Potentially using a password that hackers have in a word bank is an unnecessary risk.\n\nIt might seem surprising that a chatbot wouldn't be good at generating random passwords, but it makes sense based on how they work. LLMs are trained to predict the next token, or data point, that should appear in a sequence. In this case, the LLM is trying to choose the characters that make the most sense to appear next, which is the opposite of \"random.\" If the LLM has passwords in its training data, it may incorporate that into its answer. The password it generates makes sense in its \"mind,\" because that's what it's been trained on. It isn't programmed to be random.\n\nMeanwhile, traditional password managers are not LLMs. Instead, they are designed to produce a truly random sequence, by taking cryptographic bits and converting them into characters. These outputs are not based on existing training data and follow no patterns, so the chances that someone else out there has the same password as you (or that hackers have it stored in a word bank) is slim. There are plenty of options out there to use, and most password managers come with secure password generators.\n\nBut you don't even need one of these programs to make a secure password. Just pick two or three \"uncommon\" words, mix a few of the characters up, and presto: You have a random, unique, and secure password. For example, you could take the words \"shall,\" \"murk,\" and \"tumble,\" and combine them into \"sH@_llMurktUmbl_e.\" (Don't use that one, since it's no longer unique.)\n\nIf you're looking to boost your personally security even further, consider passkeys whenever possible. Passkeys combine the convenience of passwords with the security of 2FA: With passkeys, your device is your password. You use its built-in authentication to log in (face scan, fingerprint, or PIN), which means there's no password to actually create. Without the trusted device, hackers won't be able to break into your account.\n\nNot all accounts support passkeys, which means they aren't a universal solution right now. You'll likely need passwords for some of your accounts, which means abiding by proper security methods to keep things in order. But replacing some of your passwords with passkeys can be a step up in both security and convenience—and avoids the security pitfalls of asking ChatGPT to make your passwords for you.",

    "fullText": "Celtic interim chairman Brian Wilson has vowed to seek an end to \"this debilitating and unnecessary atmosphere of conflict\" after a fan protest during Thursday's Europa League game left the Scottish champions fearing disciplinary action.\n\nUefa's disciplinary body will review reports from officials at the game against Stuttgart before deciding what, if any, action will be taken after it was held up for more than three minutes when tennis balls were thrown on to the Celtic Park pitch.\n\nIt is the latest in a long line of protests this season as fans expressed disappointment at the club's board.\n\nMartin O'Neill's side lost the first leg of their knockout play-off 4-1.\n\nScotland set to lose second Champions League place\n\nCeltic's O'Neill seeks 'utopia' after Euro setback\n\nCeltic v Hibs, Bartley & Chermiti in focus\n\n\"Last night was deeply disappointing for the club in many respects,\" Wilson said. \"This started with an orchestrated disruption of the game, causing a delay to an important match.\n\n\"Over the past two weeks, I have met with a range of supporters' groups and individual supporters.\n\n\"I have met in good faith with representatives of the Green Brigade and was hopeful that progress could have been made; indeed this remains the case. I also met in good faith with representatives of the Celtic Fans Collective.\n\n\"When I came into this role, I asked for unity inside the stadium to support the team while trying to resolve other issues. I want to see suspensions lifted and differences set aside, but this cannot be unconditional.\"\n\nWilson had taken over as interim chairman after former chief executive Peter Lawwell stood down in December citing \"abuse and threats\".\n\nRelations appeared to be thawing in January when the Celtic Fans Collective praised Wilson's appeal for unity and appealed for common ground while again calling for changes to the club's hierarchy.\n\nThe latest tennis ball protest led to criticism from team boss O'Neill.\n\n\"Last night's disruption and the reasoning behind it illustrate the difficulty we face and have repeatedly had to contend with,\" Wilson added.\n\n\"This is not intended to deflect from other issues that affect the club and are fully recognised. However, the possibility of further disruptions needs to be addressed urgently.\n\n\"Surely the priority must be to give Martin and our players every opportunity to achieve their objectives within the remainder of the season.\n\n\"On that basis, I will continue to seek an end to this debilitating and unnecessary atmosphere of conflict.\"\n\nVisit our Celtic page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Celtic news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "fullText": "Milan-Cortina 2026 has been one of the most eventful Winter Olympics in history – in sporting and political terms - so it is appropriate that the final medal event could be the most enticing of all.\n\nCanada and United States have been the two best teams in the men's ice hockey competition, and they will duke it out at Milano Santagiulia Arena on Sunday at 13.10 GMT.\n\nFor two of the most storied nations in the sport, however, they have very different Olympic histories.\n\nCanada are aiming to be the first nation to earn 10 men's ice hockey gold medals, most recently winning the title in 2014.\n\nUSA meanwhile have not claimed the men's title since 1980 - the 'Miracle on Ice' triumph over Soviet Union in Lake Placid - and have not beaten Canada in a men's final since 1960.\n\nCanada have beaten the American men in their past two Olympic final meetings - Salt Lake City 2002 and Vancouver 2010. But the USA are looking for a double in Milan after their women's side defeated the Canadians on Thursday.\n\nThe two teams did not have a totally smooth skate to this point. Both needed overtime to win their quarter-finals, while Canada had to come from 2-0 down to beat Finland 3-2 in Friday's semi-final on Friday, scoring the winner with 35 seconds on the clock.\n\nThe Canadians also have fitness issues. They could be without captain Sidney Crosby, who was forced off in their last eight win over Czech Republic with a knee injury and missed the Finland semi. Canada are hopeful to have him for Sunday, but he certainly will not be 100% fit.\n\nThe squad has also been afflicted by a sickness bug, which dramatically revealed itself in the quarter-final when Nathan MacKinnon threw up while sat on the bench.\n\nBut even when impacted by injury and illness, Canada still have the strongest team.\n\n\"In Connor McDavid you have the best player on the planet by a million miles,\" ice hockey commentator Seth Bennett told BBC Sport. \"He was averaging three points a game going into semi-finals.\n\n\"McKinnon is another superstar offensive player. Defensively, Cale Makar is the best defenceman in the world and a gamechanger. All will be judged against him.\n\n\"You mix them up and it's like if you have a computer game and you put all the best players on one team.\"\n\nThey also have some of the best up-and-coming talents in the game, such as 19-year-old Macklin Celebrini who has already scored the most points by a teenager in an Olympic competition.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nUSA meanwhile have stars of their own, but don't have the attacking gifts of the Canadians.\n\n\"The Tkachuk brothers [Brady and Matthew], and Jack Eichel, that attacking line has worked well together,\" Bennett said.\n\n\"What they have not had is much scoring from captain Auston Matthews, he has not yet taken any of the games by the horns. They are OK, but not more than that.\"\n\nHowever, the Americans have the best defenceman at the Games in Quinn Hughes, who scored the crucial winner against Sweden.\n\n\"He might be the best three-on-three player in the world,\" said Bennett. \"He loves to keep possession, and is always looking to make an exciting play.\"\n\nIt sets up a mouth-watering finale of an Olympic ice hockey competition which has benefitted hugely from the return of National Hockey League (NHL) players for the first time since 2014.\n\nThe attendance of players from the top North American league was in doubt for a time over concerns about the ice quality at the unfinished Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena, but they have been a major boon for the Games.\n\n\"This is the highest level of hockey we have ever seen at an Olympics,\" said Bennett. \"The NHL players have made it a different world.\n\n\"At the last two Olympics, games have been good but have missed the quality in the final third, the big moments. Players didn't have the skillset to break a game, so saw a lot of tight, dull games\n\n\"Some of what the players have been doing here has been mind-blowing. One of the goals scored for Canada, McDavid saucered this pass from the back door [behind the goal], it lands as McKinnon is shooting, on the half-volley. That's when you recognise it.\n\n\"I have been getting phone calls from people in the hockey world, all they have been saying is, this is so good. There have been periods where Kent [Simpson, BBC co-commentator] and I have just been sat watching, smiling, laughing.\"\n\nCanada have won gold in three of the five Olympics when NHL players have featured and will fancy their chances in a game on Sunday which could be as fascinating in the stands as it is on the ice.\n\nIt is highly likely that Canadian prime minister Mark Carney will be in Milan for the game.\n\nNot only is Canada as a country hockey-mad, but so is Carney - when working as governor of the Bank of England, he would play for a recreational team in Haringey, north London.\n\nThe big question is whether his American counterpart will also be in Italy.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThe BBC understands that, as of Friday afternoon, Donald Trump is scheduled to remain in Washington DC - but that could now change.\n\nIt would be a logistical and security nightmare for the International Olympic Committee should he attend, and it would add a major frisson to an already charged game.\n\nTrump's vice president JD Vance attended a USA group stage game, and the Olympic opening ceremony at San Siro where he was loudly booed when he appeared on the stadium's big screen.\n\nAnd the presence of Trump - who previously said he will impose tariffs on imported goods from Canada, while also floating the idea of their northern neighbours becoming the US's 51st state - would turn the Santagiulia Arena into a political cauldron.\n\nHis impact was seen in February 2025, when the Four Nations match between the United States and Canada descended into chaos with three fights breaking out between players in the first nine seconds.\n\nThe crowd at Montreal's Bell Centre for that game loudly booed the US national anthem pre-game - an issue which will be avoided in Milan. What happens after the game depends on the victor.\n\nAnd Bennett thinks the heightened stakes and occasion will mean a less pugilistic occasion.\n\n\"There won't be a repeat of the fights with a gold medal on the line,\" he said. \"They will be at each other though; in every break in play, there will be a cross-check, a word, a push, a scrum.\n\n\"Then when they fly back, they will fly on the same private jets because the NHL will put on transport.\n\n\"For example, you have Matthew Tkachuk for USA and Brad Marchand for Canada, who are both rink rats, they will go head-to-head 100%. Then they will be on the same flight, they are Florida Panthers teammates and will try to win the Stanley Cup together.\"\n\nThe crowd may also be less tense due to the likelihood of more neutrals buying tickets for an Olympic spectacle, rather than a potential grudge match.\n\nSo, if you are a neutral going to the game, who does Seth think you should support?\n\n\"Canada going for their 10th gold, so usually the neutral will go with the underdog,\" he says. \"But that is USA.\n\n\"Canada are a bit arrogant too, but they have all the favourite players. How do you not love a team with all those players?\n\n\"But how do you not love a USA team who are having this much fun?\"",

    "fullText": "Great Britain has fallen 25 years behind the best short track nations in the world amid outdated facilities and rising costs, according to British Ice Skating's head of performance.\n\nTeam GB's only short track representative at Milan-Cortina 2026, Niall Treacy, crashed in all three events - 500m, 1,000m and 1500m.\n\nThe 25-year-old reached the final of the 1500m, finishing ninth. But he was the only Brit to compete, with Team GB unable to fill their quota of three athletes.\n\nIt is a far cry from eight years ago, when a well-funded team of five were sent to PyeongChang 2018 with realistic medal hopes.\n\nBut a failure to get on the podium in Korea saw the sport's funding slashed, and head of performance Jon Eley says they have been rebuilding ever since.\n\nFormer short track skater Eley – who represented Britain in three Olympics between 2006 and 2014 – told BBC Sport: \"Go back to PyeongChang, where short track was funded well and we had a world champion [Elise Christie] in the team. That was a Games when we were disappointed not to win a medal.\n\n\"Since then, we have been rebuilding. During that time many teams have gone to the next level of performance and resources.\n\n\"When I made the team 25 years ago and we moved to Nottingham, we had one of the best facilities in the world; now, we don't have an international standard arena. We have a lot of work to do.\"\n\nBefore the 2018 Games, UK Sport provided £4.8m to short track skating. As of 2026, the latest UK Sport funding allocation of just under £2m has been presented as a total for short track, figure and long track speed skating.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nBritain has no international quality rinks to host short track events – such as an arena with soft padding around the barriers in case of crashes - meaning Treacy trained with the Dutch national team ahead of the Olympics.\n\nAnd Eley says there are no plans to improve facilities, due to a lack of funding as well as the greater popularity of other winter sports.\n\n\"If you do that [install padding] you can't have hockey on the rink, you can't have pucks with the pads, so you are cutting the use of the facility,\" he said. \"Ice hockey is a big participation sport in the UK.\n\n\"We had that in the lead up to PyeongChang, a hybrid system – pads in place during the week then they take them out on the weekend when the hockey team played.\n\n\"But it was costing £30,000 a week because of how much work it took to take the barriers in and out.\n\n\"Plus, the cost of running rinks in the last few years has gone through the roof, the cost of freezing the ice and the price of energy.\"\n\nInstead, short track will have to be clever with their funding and facilities – and Eley says they could look to a sport where Britain have had Olympic success.\n\nTwo of Britain's three golds at Milan-Cortina have been in skeleton, despite training on a single track in Bath with no ice.\n\nHowever, a clear talent ID and training programme brought success, followed by funding to allow for greater strides to be made in design and hiring world-class coaches.\n\n\"From a skeleton perspective, they might not have loads of access to tracks, but what they do, they do very well,\" he said. \"So we can learn from them.\"\n\nShort track is currently funded as a development sport, and Eley says they are looking to have a stronger and larger team for French Alps 2030.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Britain's Conor Benn has left Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Boxing organisation to join Dana White's Zuffa Boxing promotional company.\n\nThe 29-year-old had been with Matchroom since turning professional and beat long-time rival Chris Eubank Jr in a blockbuster rematch at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in November, having lost their first bout in April.\n\nIn a statement on Instagram, Benn said he was \"filled with excitement and hunger for what's ahead with Zuffa Boxing\" while paying tribute to his former promoters.\n\n\"First and foremost I want to thank Eddie and the entire team at Matchroom for everything they have done for me over the past decade,\" wrote Benn, the son of former two-weight world champion Nigel.\n\n\"From guiding me when I first turned pro, to headlining stadium shows. They were not only with me for those highlight moments but stood shoulder to shoulder with me during the tough times.\"\n\nBenn and Eubank Jr were originally set to fight in 2022 but the bout was called off when Benn failed a voluntary drugs test - twice testing positive for the banned substance Clomifene.\n\nThat sparked a two-year battle with authorities, before Benn's suspension was lifted in November 2024.\n\nBenn has won 24 of his 25 professional bouts, with his only loss coming against Eubank - whose father Chris Sr fought Nigel Benn twice in the early 1990s.\n\nVictory over Eubank Jr in November has left Conor Benn on the verge of challenging for a world title.\n\nZuffa Boxing, backed by UFC chief White and Saudi Arabian money, staged its first event in January and has vowed to transform professional boxing.\n\nWhite's ultimate aim is to sideline the four traditional sanctioning bodies - WBO, WBC, IBF and WBA - and make Zuffa's belt the premier world title alongside the Ring Magazine title, an organisation owned by Saudi boxing powerbroker Turki Alalshikh.\n\n\"Conor Benn is an absolute beast and a superstar,\" said White. \"He shows up every time and destroys people, and now some of the best fighters in the world are calling him out.\n\n\"He's ready for a world title next and I can't wait to see him compete in Zuffa Boxing. He's going to be a huge addition to a growing stable of very talented boxers.\"\n\nBenn said he hoped Hearn could still be involved in future fights, adding: \"I want the legacy fights, the biggest nights, the biggest stages. I fear no man at any weight and I'm ready to give the fans the fights they've been calling for.\"\n\nAbsolutely nobody in boxing had this on their bingo card. There were no whispers, rumours or cryptic social media hints.\n\nUsually when a fighter jumps ship, the outgoing promoter gets ahead of it with a statement or some kind of warning shot - not this time.\n\nWhite has made no secret of his desire to disrupt boxing's power structure, and securing Benn - a fighter with genuine mainstream appeal, albeit still with doubters - is a statement signing.\n\nHearn had stood firmly behind Benn throughout the doping saga and was actively manoeuvring him towards a world-title shot. Benn is the mandatory challenger for the winner of Mario Barrios v Ryan Garcia, and has made no secret of his ambition to become a world champion.\n\nSo what does this mean for those plans? Zuffa recently signed reigning cruiserweight world champion Jai Opetaia, yet the long-term vision is one belt, a Zuffa title, and no reliance on the traditional sanctioning bodies.\n\nIf that is the direction, what does Benn do now? Will he target becoming the first Zuffa welterweight champion?\n\nOver the past week, White dismissed Hearn's credentials and quipped he works for his father Barry - prompting the younger Hearn to fire back that White's boss is Alalshikh.\n\nFrom a pure PR standpoint, this is a major win for White. This brewing promotional rivalry just got a whole lot louder.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Tries: Clark, Feldt, Shorrocks Goals: Hastings 4\n\nTries: Charnley, Senior, Hodgson Goals: Cook 3\n\nSt Helens gave new coach Paul Rowley his first Super League win in a hectic, breathless encounter with Leigh Leopards at the Brewdog Stadium.\n\nNew signing Jackson Hastings kicked the decisive penalty after he had created and then converted a try for Joe Shorrocks, his first in the club's colours, to level the scores.\n\nLeigh, after beating Leeds Rhinos in their opener last week, twice led through tries from Josh Charnley, Innes Senior and Bailey Hodgson, with Adam Cook adding two difficult conversions and a penalty.\n\nSaints, who lost Jonny Lomax to a suspected broken arm and Nene Macdonald to a thigh injury, hit back well through tries from Daryl Clark and Kyle Feldt before Shorrocks and Hastings came up with the points that edged them to the win.\n\nLeeds overpower York for first Super League win\n\nBlake scores twice as Bradford overpower Catalans\n\nHull KR beat Brisbane to win World Club Challenge\n\nLeigh have bossed this fixture in the past two seasons, winning the last four meetings and Saints, after losing full-back Jack Welsby to a dislocated shoulder in defeat by Warrington Wolves last week, looked vulnerable early on after a re-shuffle.\n\nCharnley finished in the corner to put the Leopards ahead but after Clark had barrelled over and Hastings added the extras to put them ahead, Saints lost Lomax to force more changes to their set-up.\n\nA Hastings penalty increased the lead but Leigh came on strong as Tesi Nu sent Innes Senior in for a try in the corner and more fine handling by the Leopards ended with Hodgson feinting and darting over to put daylight between them and the home side.\n\nSaints hit back when a fortuitous bounce from the restart gave them good field position and Feldt pounced for a try, but the loss of Macdonald further disrupted their ranks before half time.\n\nCook's early penalty opened a six-point lead but the second half belonged to Saints, who had clearly heeded Rowley's insistence that they needed to sharpen up their defence after losing to Wolves.\n\nHastings' short pass sent Shorrocks crashing over between the posts and after his conversion had made it 18-18, the 2019 Man of Steel added a penalty to secure the points.\n\nSt Helens coach Paul Rowley told BBC Radio Merseyside:\n\n\"It was an absolute rollercoaster of emotions for myself and the coaching staff. First and foremost, getting over injuries with a long time left in the game, was a challenge we had to get over pretty quickly.\n\n\"The players had to not let that derail what we are about and how we had prepared and planned and that we still had that belief, with people out of position, that we could hold tight, stay resilient and get the outcome we wanted.\n\n\"It's a long list of injuries and Jonny [Lomax] and Nene [Macdonald] going off so early in the game had a direct impact on the fluidity of what we wanted to do, offensively.\n\n\"As always, you learn more about people in adversity, so buckle up and we'll see where we get.

    "description": "Sheffield Wednesday are on the brink of becoming the first team in English Football League history to be relegated in February.",
    "fullText": "Barring a highly unlikely series of results, administration-hit Sheffield Wednesday will become the first team in English Football League history to be relegated in February at some point in the next week.\n\nThe foundations for this relegation were set last summer when former owner Dejphon Chansiri's chaotic tenure came to a head with numerous missed wage payments.\n\nA large number of the senior squad and manager Danny Rohl left in the summer before the Owls were eventually placed into administration in October.\n\nTwo separate points deductions - totalling 18 points - followed, and it has always been a case of when, not if they went down from the Championship this season.\n\nA preferred bidder for the club was selected in December but the Owls remain in administration and are operating under tight restrictions, leaving them with a threadbare squad ill-equipped to compete at this level.\n\nHowever, few would have thought relegation could come quite as early as this and, to make matters worse, it could in fact now be confirmed at bitter cross-city rivals Sheffield United on Sunday.\n\nIf Sheffield Wednesday win all of their remaining 14 games of the season, they will finish the campaign on 35 points.\n\nFollowing Blackburn's win against Preston on Friday, the Owls will be relegated on Saturday if West Bromwich Albion beat leaders Coventry.\n\nA draw or a Coventry win would mean that Wednesday, who are still on -7 points, must then win at Bramall Lane to stop the 'R' from being placed next to their name this weekend.\n\nWinning a derby away from home is a tall task at the best of times, but when you consider that Wednesday's only win all season came at Portsmouth in September, they have lost their past nine games in the Championship, and have not so much as scored in the past six Steel City derbies, you get some idea of what Henrik Pedersen's beleaguered men are up against.\n\n\"We will do everything to bring a top, top performance to compete with them,\" Pederson told BBC Radio Sheffield. .\n\n\"Of course, we know it will happen some day.\n\n\"Nobody understands what this group has been through in the past many months.\n\n\"I have a group with a big belief and big motivation, and a group of senior players who are ready to do everything for our fans and stand up and perform.\n\n\"They know that 95% will not be enough.\"\n\nThe 18 points Sheffield Wednesday have been deducted are the third highest in a single Football League season.\n\nDerby County were deducted 21 in the 2021-22 campaign but took their fight for Championship survival through to April, while Luton Town were hit with a 30-point penalty in the 2008-09 season but finished on a creditable 26 points as they dropped out of League Two and also won the Football League Trophy.\n\nWith 14 games to go, Wednesday are also in danger of setting several more unwanted EFL records, including:\n\nNo team has ever ended a season on minus points. The Owls, who have won 11 points from 32 games so far, need seven from 14 matches to avoid this.\n\nAllowing for three points a game, the fewest points a team has ever picked up in a Football League season is Loughborough with nine in 1899-1900. In more recent times, Derby County went down from the Premier League with 11 points in the 2007-08 season. The all-time low for a 46-game season is Doncaster Rovers' 20 points in 1997-98.\n\nThe record for the most defeats in a 46-game league season also belongs to Doncaster with 34 in the 1997-98 campaign. Wednesday have lost 23 of their first 32 games, meaning 12 defeats in their remaining 14 matches would see them break that record.\n\nThe most consecutive defeats suffered by a team in one season was by Darwen way back in the 1898-99 season with 18. Since the second tier was rebranded as the Championship, the record for the most successive defeats is Rotherham's 10 in the 2016-17 season. Pedersen's side have lost their past nine games.\n\nIn a 46-game season, the fewest wins a team has ever managed is Rochdale's two as they were relegated from the third tier in 1973-74.\n\nWednesday's only win this season came away from home, meaning the Owls are now just six games from becoming the first Football League team to go an entire season without a home win.\n\nThe farthest adrift a team has finished is Stoke City in the 1984-85 season. They finished 33 points from safety in the top tier. At present, the Owls are 41 points behind 21st-placed West Brom.\n\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder has said the prospect of relegating their cross-city rivals is \"not in his thought process at all\".\n\nThe Blades fan, who is unbeaten in his seven games against the Owls, said he disagreed with the notion that his side, who are 15th in the table, should cruise to a win.\n\n\"We'll have done more preparation on this game than we have on any game this season and all the games other than the play-off final last season,\" he told BBC Radio Sheffield.\n\n\"I've got complete respect for Henrik and a group of players... there's talk of it being a mismatch or a gimme, whether it's bookies' odds or the narrative in the city... football just doesn't work like that.\n\n\"The players have to play with a discipline and a control to win a game of football, to win a local derby.\"\n\nWilder added: \"We put a slide up about Macclesfield v Crystal Palace and Bodo/Glimt v Manchester City. There are all sorts of examples recently, let alone [in] the 100 years plus of football, the game isn't decided on team sheets.\n\n\"We understand it's basically their season on the line, we're not daft. But we've got our fight, and ours has to be bigger than theirs.\"\n\nLatest Sheffield Wednesday news, analysis and fan views\n\nListen to Sheffield Wednesday content on BBC Sounds",

    "description": "Preparation, training, and belief - after Keely Hodgkinson smashes the indoor 800m world record, her coach Jenny Meadows explains how their plan came together.",
    "fullText": "Keely Hodgkinson had been preparing for this moment for years.\n\nWhen she stepped on to the indoor track in France on Thursday, the Briton and her team \"had no doubt\" she was going to break the 800m indoor world record - and she did so in some style.\n\nBut it has not all been plain sailing for Hodgkinson since she won the Olympic 800m title at Paris 2024.\n\nThe 23-year-old suffered injury issues last year which challenged her physically and mentally - but has used those setbacks to return even stronger, with her training group, the M11 Track Club, dubbing her 'Keely 2.0'.\n\nShe proved she is back to her best with her stunning indoor run in Lievin, crossing the line in one minute 54.87 seconds to smash a world record which had stood since 3 March 2002 - the day Hodgkinson was born.\n\nAnd this is how Hodgkinson etched her name in the history books.\n\nSince 2019, Hodgkinson has trained with coaches Trevor Painter and Jenny Meadows in Manchester.\n\nMeadows, a former international runner, was in France to watch her protege take almost a second off the 800m indoor record, set by Slovenia's Jolanda Ceplak almost 24 years ago.\n\n\"She actually said to me the day before: 'obviously I know I'm going to get it',\" said Meadows.\n\n\"There had been so many benchmarks we measure in training, we had no doubt that she would do it.\n\n\"Her biggest fear was to set a world record, but be disappointed with the time. She said 'what if I can't smile? What if I've got the world record, and everyone's so excited, and I think, oh that was rubbish. I could have gone faster'?\"\n\nThe date - 19 February 2026 - had long been set in the diary by Meadows and Hodgkinson given the track in Lievin is notoriously fast.\n\n\"Lievin has had a lot of world records over the years, and we kind of thought 'you know what, let's go with the statistics',\" Meadows said.\n\n\"We're only probably going to get one opportunity during this indoor season to go for it. So that's the event that we picked, and that's the date we've really had etched in our minds the last three months.\"\n\n\"I've got to say, the time she did was the bare minimum of what she was happy with,\" Meadows added.\n\n\"She definitely would have liked to run faster, and there was definitely half a second, maybe even up to one second in those legs.\"\n\nMeadows retired from the sport in 2016. As a former world and European medallist over 800m, she knew exactly what was required to make history.\n\n\"800m is so tough, your body is literally breaking down from the training,\" she said.\n\n\"Keely can be doing certain repetitions, and she's being physically sick from the lactic acid. It's a little bit inhumane at times.\"\n\nIn the build-up to Thursday's race, Meadows said the team learned lessons from previous years, and resisted the urge to do too much training with Hodgkinson - instead believing in the process and their athlete.\n\n\"Keely is a really interesting character. I was quite robotic and could follow a routine. Keely keeps us on our toes. We have to keep her interested. So we're always trying to do little different goals for her.\"\n\nMeadows added: \"We've not been greedy, we've really held back and said we need to believe in our process. We need to believe in our product. We need to believe in our athlete, that Keely can stand on that start line and deliver when the eyes of the world are on her.\"\n\nNine months ago the success experienced in Lievin would have felt like a distant dream for Hodgkinson.\n\nShe had planned a tilt at the 800m indoor world record at her eponymous Keely Klassic event in February 2025 and \"was in great shape\", according to Meadows.\n\nHowever, a hamstring problem forced Hodgkinson to withdraw, regroup and retrain - only for the injury to reoccur 12 weeks later.\n\nDespite setbacks and a reduction in training, she made it to the start line for September's World Athletics Championships, claiming bronze behind GB team-mate Georgia Hunter Bell and winner Kenya's Lilian Odira.\n\n\"It was phenomenal, given the very little preparation [Hodgkinson] did but I doubt she's ever looked at that medal again. She wants the gold, she wants the records, and that is what was driving her forward,\" said Meadows.\n\n\"She isn't the most talented athlete I have ever seen. The difference between Keely and a lot of others is mindset, she can get the best out of herself on a daily basis.\"\n\nIn under a month Hodgkinson will head to Poland to compete in the World Athletics Indoor Championships as a firm favourite for gold.\n\nBeyond that there is another target in her sights - the world record that has stood longer than any other in athletics.\n\nIn July 1983, Czech athlete Jarmila Kratochvilova set a women's outdoor 800m world record in a time of 1:53.28.\n\nBut 43 years on, Hodgkinson wants to beat that mark and make more history.\n\n\"She wants that more than the indoor record. Her ambition is to be a legend of the sport,\" said Meadows.\n\nKratochvilova's time remains more than a second quicker than Hodgkinson's current personal best of 1:54.61, a national record she set in London in 2024.\n\nHer coach believes London could be the scene of what would be arguably Hodgkinson's greatest achievement.\n\n\"I think she would like to do it in the UK. London always delivers a great crowd, a great occasion. In 2026 I think she can definitely run under 1:54...\n\n\"If she goes in on interrupted training, she really does stand a chance.\"",

    "description": "\"Wonderfully different\" Henry Pollock will start his first England Test in Saturday's must-win Six Nations game against Ireland.",
    "fullText": "Henry Pollock has never been short on confidence. He also knows how to leave an impression.\n\nEngland head coach Steve Borthwick speaks to Rugby Football Union director of performance Conor O'Shea \"four or five times a week\" about talent coming through the system.\n\nA blond-haired schoolboy flanker sprinting from his own 22 to score a solo try, external for Northampton Saints Under-18s will not go unmissed.\n\nHowever, it was a colourful post-match interview that first brought Pollock's personality to screens, as the youngster chose not to hold back after England Under-18s were beaten by South Africa in 2022.\n\nPollock's potty mouth was different and unexpected. The talent was always undeniable, but the personality drew attention.\n\nWhen visiting some of Northampton's England players, Borthwick was told to meet the then teenager, who was not long out of school.\n\n\"Normally, when an 18-year-old meets the England head coach for the first time and you don't know each other at all, they are reasonably shy and reserved at that point in time. He was the complete opposite,\" Borthwick told BBC Rugby Union Weekly.\n\n\"He bounded up to me and introduced himself, and I think his words were 'how are you, mate?' I thought 'this guy is wonderfully different, he is an incredible character, full of confidence'.\"\n\nAfter a meteoric rise, Saturday's match against Ireland - which England likely need to win to keep their Six Nations title hopes alive - will be Pollock's first Test start.\n\nDespite it being England captain Maro Itoje's 100th cap, many headlines have been around the inclusion of the 21-year-old tyro, who played for the British and Irish Lions last year after an extraordinary breakthrough season.\n\nSaturday 21 February at 14:10 GMT\n\nListen to live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds with live text updates on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nSuch has been Pollock's impact that already children at rugby clubs across England have been spotted running around with black head tape on, scoring tries and imitating his pulse-checking celebration.\n\nNorthampton's club shop does a roaring trade in sales of black head tape, which Pollock wears to protect his ears.\n\nBut his influence goes further than that.\n\nFormer Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll came home from covering last Saturday's game against Italy in Dublin to find his son dressed as Pollock.\n\nBordeaux Begles players mocked Pollock, who ended up in a final-whistle scuffle, in their post-match celebrations after winning last season's Champions Cup final.\n\n\"Pollock is an outstanding rugby player and I think he is brilliant for the game,\" former Scotland scrum-half Andy Nicol told Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"My daughters are 25 and 22 and they don't know who Tom Curry or Ben Earl are. They know who Henry Pollock is.\"\n\nIn less than six months, he went from being an England Under-20 player to playing for the British and Irish Lions.\n\n\"He is a great character and I got on well with him on the Lions tour in a weird kind of way,\" said assistant coach Johnny Sexton, who received a tongue-in-cheek 40th birthday message on tour off Pollock.\n\nA number of solo tries - one which cut open Leinster in a Champions Cup semi-final win and a remarkable chip-and-chase against Sale Sharks - showed Pollock has the speed and finishing prowess of a Test winger.\n\nThat ability to turn a game on its head, with a moment of magic, was missing for England in their defeat by Scotland last weekend.\n\nFormer Ireland wing Shane Horgan added on BBC 5 Live: \"He does things that few others can, I wouldn't be surprised if there's a spectacular moment by him [against Ireland] that galvanises England's performance.\n\n\"You've got an extremely highly skilled, massively talented individual who has enormous self-confidence, and that confidence has not been blunted by anything yet.\n\n\"That is when you get those generational players. They have all the components but also this bullet-proof confidence, which means they can just keep on delivering throughout their career.\"\n\nWhy Pollock may be England's next breakthrough star\n\nFive moments that made England centurion Itoje\n\n'Ireland plot upset with title hopes on the line'\n\nBorthwick has leaned into Pollock's energy, deploying him as an impact replacement for all seven of his England caps.\n\nFormer Ireland scrum-half Conor Murray played against Pollock in Europe last season and could not believe he has yet to start for England.\n\n\"He has been ripping it up for so long,\" Murray told BBC Rugby Union Weekly. \"He is perceived very well in my book.\n\n\"It was something very different when he came on the scene - too loud and brash - but what makes that OK in my sporting world is that he backs it up all the time.\n\n\"People talk about Pollock being so good off the bench with his dynamism, power and energy.\n\n\"Watch him for Northampton - he goes from the first minute to the 80th minute and does not look tired. I think he is a real danger.\"\n\nPollock, who can play across the back row, also enjoys playing on the edge, adding that he plays best when \"aggressive and confrontational\".\n\nHis love-hate relationship with fans in France continued this season in Bordeaux as he was booed in the Champions Cup final rematch, where he scored twice in defeat.\n\n\"Nobody boos rubbish players, nobody boos somebody they don't actually respect,\" Northampton boss Phil Dowson said.\n\nImpressive performances off the bench against Scotland and Wales have earned him a start at number eight, a position where he has scored six tries in his past five starts for Saints.\n\nFlanker Tom Curry, who started all three Lions Tests, has recently been used as a replacement in a back-row combination with Pollock.\n\nGetting one of England's big-game players on from the start would also have helped pave the way for Pollock, with Ben Earl's speed at open-side flanker also useful in trying to out-run Ireland.\n\n\"Henry Pollock is always tremendously excited. That is his general state. He lives at a level of excitement,\" Borthwick added.\n\n\"The supporters see the joy he plays the game with and they are excited by him.\"\n\nThe last time Pollock faced Irish opposition he played the entire 80 minutes and delivered a performance that accelerated his career and profile.\n\nA similar performance on Saturday may do the same, but this time as a Test starter.\n\nSix Nations: All about Ireland with Conor Murray",

    "description": "As pre-season testing reaches its conclusion, which teams look best - and worst - placed ahead of the Australian Grand Prix?",
    "fullText": "The final pre-season test confirmed there will be a new Formula 1 when the 2026 season starts in Australia in two weeks' time.\n\nNew in the sense of who is at the front - and new in terms of many aspects of the sport and how it works.\n\nSo what did the last three days of running in Bahrain, before the teams decamp to Albert Park in Melbourne, say about the reshaped sport - and who are the winners and losers within that?\n\nFerrari's Charles Leclerc ended the test with the single fastest lap time in an emphatic way - 0.811 seconds quicker than the next best time, set by Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli.\n\nHeadline times in testing are usually not the place to look to gauge the competitive order, but this did reflect the picture in one important way - Mercedes and Ferrari look like they are going into the new season in the best shape.\n\nAndrea Stella, team principal of world champions McLaren, said on Friday evening: \"This test has confirmed that Ferrari and Mercedes look like the teams to beat. McLaren and Red Bull [are] probably very similar, Ferrari and Mercedes a step ahead.\"\n\nThis picture, an impression reflected by many other senior figures up and down the pit lane, comes less from the headline lap times - even if they did show the teams in the order Ferrari, Mercedes, McLaren, Red Bull - than the so-called race-simulation runs.\n\nBecause the teams fill up their cars with fuel and run a grand prix distance, these have far fewer variables to muddy the picture than single laps.\n\nOn Friday evening, Leclerc did the best race simulation of the week, slightly quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen and McLaren's Oscar Piastri the day before, when they set more or less exactly the same time.\n\nMercedes did not do any race simulations in the second week, only in the first, when track conditions were up to a second slower.\n\nAntonelli set comfortably the fastest race simulation of the first week - a lot faster than Piastri, who was running at the same time.\n\nAnd his team-mate George Russell - the bookies' pre-season championship favourite - was also impressively quick when running in the hotter, slower conditions earlier in the day.\n\nThis is not an exact science, but the cumulation of data is what led to the conclusion reached by Stella and many others.\n\nA complication was that McLaren were not running the latest specification of Mercedes power-unit, which Mercedes were proving out, so can expect an uplift when they switch in Australia to the latest spec.\n\nAnother is Red Bull's new engine is said by Russell to have the best deployment of energy, which is such an important facet this season.\n\nMercedes' biggest concern is reliability. This hit Antonelli much more than Russell, but it's probably fair to say that Mercedes suffered more problems than their major rivals, although Red Bull's new recruit Isack Hadjar did lose a fair bit of his running to issues of one kind or another.\n\nRelive final day of pre-season testing as Ferrari's Leclerc fastest in Bahrain\n\n'Keep calm,' says Domenicali on criticism of new F1 rules\n\nNorris admits new F1 cars 'not purest form of racing'\n\nThere is no question as to the prize for biggest disappointment so far this year. Aston Martin, starting their new works partnership with Honda, are runaway winners of that.\n\nWith design legend Adrian Newey at the helm, Honda - world champions with Red Bull as recently as 2024 - and the money of their billionaire owner Lawrence Stroll and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), all the ingredients for success seem to be there.\n\nBut the new car, delayed by the fact Newey did not arrive until March last year, is uncompetitive and difficult, and the engine is lacking power and unreliable. Aston Martin completed the fewest laps of testing, and look like they may even be in worse shape than new team Cadillac, who expected to be last this year.\n\nBoth the internal combustion engine and hybrid elements of the new Honda power-unit are said to be well behind the best.\n\nSeveral sources told BBC Sport this week that Newey said at Wednesday's meeting of the F1 Commission - a rule-making body comprising all the teams as well as F1 and the FIA - that the Honda power-unit could not even recover energy at the lower limit of 250kw, let alone the higher one of 350kw, which comes into force under certain circumstances in the highly complex rules.\n\nReliability was so bad that by the start of the final day of the test, Honda had only one battery left, and took the decision to limit running to only short runs. A statement said that was to allow them to study data in between track outings, but in the end Lance Stroll did only six laps all day.\n\nThe problems with the engine make it difficult to make any judgement on the car. There is no question it was slow in the corners - but the Honda is running so badly that it's hard for the team to work out where the car is, and therefore how to improve it.\n\nThis is exacerbated by the fact Aston's first in-house gearbox - they have bought them in previously - is not communicating with the engine properly, and keeps behaving oddly, making life even more difficult for the drivers.\n\nFor Fernando Alonso, this all must come with an agonising sense of deja vu. He spent three painful years at McLaren when Honda were underprepared when they re-entered F1 in 2015.\n\nAnd now he faces another one, at the age of 44, and with his contract running out at the end of the year.\n\nPublicly, Alonso is staying optimistic as he said: \"Short and medium term, I don't think there is anything that is impossible to fix.\"\n\nHow long it takes, though, is another matter. And one thing Alonso does not have much of is time.\n\nWhile all the teams are reluctant to say exactly where they think they stand in the competitive order, all are clear that there appears to be three groups of teams - the top four, the midfield, and then Aston Martin and Cadillac at the back.\n\nAmong the midfield runners, who are in the region of at least a second a lap slower than the big four, the team poised to make the biggest step seem to be Alpine.\n\nThey finished last season last, by the biggest margin ever, partly because they devoted extremely limited resource to last year's car, so they could focus on this year.\n\nAlpine have switched to a Mercedes power-unit, following parent company Renault's decision to end its F1 engine programme. And with the combination of this and a much-improved car appear to have jumped up to the top of the midfield fight.\n\nThere is some debate as to whether they or Haas are in the best shape, but either way this is huge progress for the French team.\n\nRacing Bulls are also in this mix at the top of the midfield.\n\nAmong the midfield teams, Williams seem to be the biggest losers. Their 2026 car has been a disappointment so far, overweight by a significant margin - said to be anywhere between 25 and 40 kilos - and lacking downforce.\n\nWilliams finished fifth last year, and this season was supposed to be the next step in their ambition of a return to the top of F1.\n\nTeam principal James Vowles has been saying for two years how much of an opportunity the new rules are to move forward, and was vocal last season as to how early they had switched to the 2026 design and compromised 2025 for exactly this reason.\n\nAudi, which has taken over Sauber for the start of its brand new works programme with its own in-house engine, were expected to have difficulties.\n\nBut they appear to be in decent shape and have been quietly impressive in the midfield context, and could well be ahead of Williams, even if a long way from their ultimate ambitions.\n\nThe leading drivers have all at various points expressed their dissatisfaction with the new rules, especially the amount of energy management required with the new hybrid power-units.\n\nThese feature a near 50-50 split between internal combustion engine and electrical components.\n\nWith the amount of hybrid power increased three-fold, a component of the engine that helped recovery energy removed, and the batteries more or less the same size as last year, the cars are energy starved.\n\nThis has led to some unusual aspects being added to driving.\n\nThese include not going flat out in the run up to the start of a qualifying lap, taking corners in higher gears than is optimum for lap time to keep the turbo spinning, lifting and coasting in qualifying, and even not going flat out at the end of a qualifying lap because it is more time-effective to use the energy elsewhere.\n\nAt some circuits, there will be a lot more energy recovery required than others by the various means available. These include recovering while at full throttle, known as \"super-clip\", and lifting and coasting, as well as the standard method, during braking.\n\nAlbert Park is one of these energy-poor circuits.\n\nFor a purist, and drivers who want to be on the limit at all times, this is not ideal.\n\nBut F1 as a sport has known this was coming ever since the power-unit regulations were created in 2022. And, for now, the drivers are going to have get used to a new normal.\n\nBehind the scenes, meanwhile, there are ongoing discussions as to how to allow the drivers to drive in a more conventional way, but it remains to be seen how these will resolve.\n\nHowever, having seen the cars on track, and watched them on television, it is highly unlikely the average viewer will notice any difference. They still look like F1 cars, and in some ways are more appealing than last year's.\n\nThey are smaller and have less downforce, so they slide \n\nRussell, while acknowledging the differences from previous cars, said: \"The guiding principles are still very much the same. You're pushing the car to the absolute limit. You're trying to brake as hard and late as possible, and carry as much speed through the corners. So far, I'm quite enjoying it.\"\n\nOff track, one of the main focuses of pre-season has been a row between the engine manufacturers over the rules governing the engines' compression ratio.\n\nIt split the engine suppliers into two groups, Mercedes versus the rest - Ferrari, Honda and newcomers Red Bull and Audi.\n\nThe row was dismissed earlier this week by Vowles - a Mercedes customer - as \"noise that will probably go away\", and by Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff as \"a storm in a teacup\".\n\nAnd it looks like both will end up being right.\n\nWhy have Mercedes been targeted? Because their rivals believe they have found a way of exploiting the rule restricting the compression ratio - a measurement of the cylinder displacement between the two extremes of the piston stroke - to 16:1. The rules dictate it is measured at ambient temperature.\n\nTypically, the compression ratio reduces when engines heat up, and the belief was Mercedes had found a way using materials technology to limit this loss.\n\nMercedes' rivals have been pushing for a rule that measures it at a higher temperature, in the hope of restricting their perceived advantage.\n\nThis could also have allowed the others to set their ambient temperature compression ratio higher than 16:1 so that it was at the limit at a higher temperature, and so improve the performance of their engines relative to Mercedes.\n\nGoverning body the FIA has proposed a compromise whereby the ratio is measured both at ambient temperature and 130C.\n\nAs this does not achieve the aim Mercedes' opponents wanted, the signs are the other companies may even vote against the proposal that came out of their own campaign. Even if it passes, it seems it will make no difference.\n\nWolff added: \"The way it works, you know, either we stay with the regulations like we are or the e-vote goes ahead with the proposal that came from the FIA. Both are OK for us.\"\n\nThe new engines are also much harder to get off the line, which many expect will lead to unpredictability at starts.\n\nThere were safety concerns about this at the start of the first test - especially the risk of a car slow away being rear-ended by another at high speed.\n\nBut these were largely assuaged by a new start line procedure that was trialled at the test, which gives the drivers more time to get the turbos spinning at the optimum speed.\n\nOn the face of it, the Ferrari-engined cars seemed to have an advantage - they rocketed past rivals on several occasions during these tests.\n\nBut Williams driver Alex Albon said: \"I don't think what you're seeing is really what's going to happen. You've got drivers who are finishing long runs, going into a practice start, on a high-mileage tyre that's already gone. So you've seen this chaos of some people getting good starts, bad starts, but actually it's not as bad as that.\"\n\nAnd data seen by BBC Sport showed that, actually, of all the starts performed in testing, the Mercedes-engined teams as a bloc had the best starts on average - they were ranked in four of the top five places - followed by Ferrari-powered cars.\n\nStrangely, Racing Bulls were second and Red Bull last, despite having the same Red Bull Powertrains/Ford engine.\n\nFerrari (Charles Leclerc) one minute 31.992 seconds\n\nMercedes (Kimi Antonelli) Mercedes 1:32.803\n\nMcLaren (Oscar Piastri) 1:32.861\n\nRed Bull (Max Verstappen) 1:33.109\n\nHaas (Oliver Bearman) Haas 1:33.487\n\nAudi (Gabriel Bortoleto) 1:33.755\n\nRacing Bulls (Arvid Lindblad) 1:34.149\n\nWilliams (Carlos Sainz) 1:34.342\n\nCadillac (Valtteri Bottas) 1:35.290\n\nAston Martin (Lance Stroll) 1:35.974",

    "description": "Cloudflare introduces Code Mode for Workers AI, a technical approach to fit entire API schemas into 1,000 tokens, enabling LLM agents to execute precise tool calls with minimal latency.",
    "fullText": "Model Context Protocol (MCP) has become the standard way for AI agents to use external tools. But there is a tension at its core: agents need many tools to do useful work, yet every tool added fills the model's context window, leaving less room for the actual task.\n\nCode Mode is a technique we first introduced for reducing context window usage during agent tool use. Instead of describing every operation as a separate tool, let the model write code against a typed SDK and execute the code safely in a Dynamic Worker Loader. The code acts as a compact plan. The model can explore tool operations, compose multiple calls, and return just the data it needs. Anthropic independently explored the same pattern in their Code Execution with MCP post.\n\nToday we are introducing a new MCP server for the entire Cloudflare API — from DNS and Zero Trust to Workers and R2 — that uses Code Mode. With just two tools, search() and execute(), the server is able to provide access to the entire Cloudflare API over MCP, while consuming only around 1,000 tokens. The footprint stays fixed, no matter how many API endpoints exist.\n\nFor a large API like the Cloudflare API, Code Mode reduces the number of input tokens used by 99.9%. An equivalent MCP server without Code Mode would consume 1.17 million tokens — more than the entire context window of the most advanced foundation models.\n\nCode mode savings vs native MCP, measured with tiktoken\n\nYou can start using this new Cloudflare MCP server today. And we are also open-sourcing a new Code Mode SDK in the Cloudflare Agents SDK, so you can use the same approach in your own MCP servers and AI Agents.\n\nThis new MCP server applies Code Mode server-side. Instead of thousands of tools, the server exports just two: search() and execute(). Both are powered by Code Mode. Here is the full tool surface area that gets loaded into the model context:\n\nTo discover what it can do, the agent calls search(). It writes JavaScript against a typed representation of the OpenAPI spec. The agent can filter endpoints by product, path, tags, or any other metadata and narrow thousands of endpoints to the handful it needs. The full OpenAPI spec never enters the model context. The agent only interacts with it through code.\n\nWhen the agent is ready to act, it calls execute(). The agent writes code that can make Cloudflare API requests, handle pagination, check responses, and chain operations together in a single execution.\n\nBoth tools run the generated code inside a Dynamic Worker isolate — a lightweight V8 sandbox with no file system, no environment variables to leak through prompt injection and external fetches disabled by default. Outbound requests can be explicitly controlled with outbound fetch handlers when needed.\n\nSuppose a user tells their agent: \"protect my origin from DDoS attacks.\" The agent's first step is to consult documentation. It might call the Cloudflare Docs MCP Server, use a Cloudflare Skill, or search the web directly. From the docs it learns: put Cloudflare WAF and DDoS protection rules in front of the origin.\n\nStep 1: Search for the right endpoints\nThe search tool gives the model a spec object: the full Cloudflare OpenAPI spec with all $refs pre-resolved. The model writes JavaScript against it. Here the agent looks for WAF and ruleset endpoints on a zone:\n\nThe server runs this code in a Workers isolate and returns:\n\nThe full Cloudflare API spec has over 2,500 endpoints. The model narrowed that to the WAF and ruleset endpoints it needs, without any of the spec entering the context window.\n\nThe model can also drill into a specific endpoint's schema before calling it. Here it inspects what phases are available on zone rulesets:\n\nThe agent now knows the exact phases it needs: ddos_l7 for DDoS protection and http_request_firewall_managed for WAF.\n\nStep 2: Act on the API\nThe agent switches to using execute. The sandbox gets a cloudflare.request() client that can make authenticated calls to the Cloudflare API. First the agent checks what rulesets already exist on the zone:\n\nThe agent sees that managed DDoS and WAF rulesets already exist. It can now chain calls to inspect their rules and update sensitivity levels in a single execution:\n\nThis entire operation, from searching the spec and inspecting a schema to listing rulesets and fetching DDoS and WAF configurations, took four tool calls.\n\nWe started with MCP servers for individual products. Want an agent that manages DNS? Add the DNS MCP server. Want Workers logs? Add the Workers Observability MCP server. Each server exported a fixed set of tools that mapped to API operations. This worked when the tool set was small, but the Cloudflare API has over 2,500 endpoints. No collection of hand-maintained servers could keep up.\n\nThe Cloudflare MCP server simplifies this. Two tools, roughly 1,000 tokens, and coverage of every endpoint in the API. When we add new products, the same search() and execute() code paths discover and call them — no new tool definitions, no new MCP servers. It even has support for the GraphQL Analytics API.\n\nOur MCP server is built on the latest MCP specifications. It is OAuth 2.1 compliant, using Workers OAuth Provider to downscope the token to selected permissions approved by the user when connecting. The agent  only gets the capabilities the user explicitly granted.\n\nFor developers, this means you can use a simple agent loop and still give your agent access to the full Cloudflare API with built-in progressive capability discovery.\n\nSeveral approaches have emerged to reduce how many tokens MCP tools consume:\n\nClient-side Code Mode was our first experiment. The model writes TypeScript against typed SDKs and runs it in a Dynamic Worker Loader on the client. The tradeoff is that it requires the agent to ship with secure sandbox access. Code Mode is implemented in Goose and Anthropics Claude SDK as Programmatic Tool Calling.\n\nCommand-line interfaces are another path. CLIs are self-documenting and reveal capabilities as the agent explores. Tools like OpenClaw and Moltworker convert MCP servers into CLIs using MCPorter to give agents progressive disclosure. The limitation is obvious: the agent needs a shell, which not every environment provides and which introduces a much broader attack surface than a sandboxed isolate.\n\nDynamic tool search, as used by Anthropic in Claude Code, surfaces a smaller set of tools hopefully relevant to the current task. It shrinks context use but now requires a search function that must be maintained and evaluated, and each matched tool still uses tokens.\n\nEach approach solves a real problem. But for MCP servers specifically, server-side Code Mode combines their strengths: fixed token cost regardless of API size, no modifications needed on the agent side, progressive discovery built in, and safe execution inside a sandboxed isolate. The agent just calls two tools with code. Everything else happens on the server.\n\nThe Cloudflare MCP server is available now. Point your MCP client at the server URL and you'll be redirected to Cloudflare to authorize and select the permissions to grant to your agent. Add this config to your MCP client:\n\nFor CI/CD, automation, or if you prefer managing tokens yourself, create a Cloudflare API token with the permissions you need. Both user tokens and account tokens are supported and can be passed as bearer tokens in the Authorization header.\n\nMore information on different MCP setup configurations can be found at the Cloudflare MCP repository.\n\nCode Mode solves context costs for a single API. But agents rarely talk to one service. A developer's agent might need the Cloudflare API alongside GitHub, a database, and an internal docs server. Each additional MCP server brings the same context window pressure we started with.\n\nCloudflare MCP Server Portals let you compose multiple MCP servers behind a single gateway with unified auth and access control. We are building a first-class Code Mode integration for all your MCP servers, and exposing them to agents with built-in progressive discovery and the same fixed-token footprint, regardless of how many services sit behind the gateway.",

    "description": "Preflight Checklist I have searched existing requests and this feature hasn't been requested yet This is a single feature request (not multiple features) Problem Statement When auto-compaction trig...",
    "fullText": "When auto-compaction triggers mid-task, the summarization process irreversibly loses user-provided data that Claude is actively working with. The compacted summary retains a reference to the data (e.g., \"user provided DOM markup\") but discards the data itself — even though the full transcript is still on disk at ~/.claude/projects/{project-path}/.\n\nConcrete example: I paste ~8,000 characters of DOM markup and ask Claude to refactor it. The session continues, auto-compaction fires, and the summary now says \"User provided 8,200 characters of DOM markup for analysis.\" When I ask a specific question about the markup, Claude either hallucinates details, hedges, or asks me to re-paste what I provided minutes ago. The transcript on disk still has the original markup — Claude just has no way to know that, or where to find it.\n\nThis isn't an edge case. Any task involving substantial user-provided input (DOM markup, config files, log output, schema definitions) is at risk the moment the context window fills up. There are at least 8 open issues describing different symptoms of this same root cause:\n\n#1534 — Memory Loss After Auto-compact (June 2025, closed — problem persists)\n\n#3021 — Forgets to Refresh Memory After Compaction\n\n#10960 — Repository Path Changes Forgotten After Compaction\n\n#13919 — Skills context completely lost after auto-compaction (compiled its own list of 5+ related issues)\n\n#14968 — Context compaction loses critical state\n\n#19888 — Conversation compaction loses entire history\n\n#21105 — Context truncation causes loss of conversation history\n\n#23620 — Agent team lost when lead's context gets compacted\n\nThe underlying problem: compaction is a one-way lossy transformation with an available lossless source that isn't wired up. The summary and the transcript coexist on disk, but the summary contains no pointer back to the source material it compressed.\n\nPhase 1: Within-session indexed transcript references\n\nTag compressed entries in the compacted summary with transcript line-range annotations so Claude can surgically recover only the specific content it needs, on demand.\n\nCurrent behavior (lossy, no recovery):\n\n[compacted] User provided 8,200 characters of DOM markup for analysis.\n\nProposed behavior (recoverable):\n\n[compacted] User provided 8,200 characters of DOM markup for analysis. [transcript:lines 847-1023]\n\nWhen Claude detects it needs the original data — because a question requires specifics the summary doesn't contain — it reads only lines 847–1023 from the transcript. Surgical recovery, minimal token cost, no wasted context on data that isn't needed.\n\nImplementation scope: A modification to the compaction summarizer — when compressing a block of content, emit the summary line plus a transcript line-range annotation. Then expose a recovery mechanism (likely a file read with offset) that Claude can invoke when it identifies a gap between what the summary references and what it can actually see.\n\nPhase 2 (future extension): Cross-session indexed lookup\n\nThe same mechanism generalizes across sessions. Transcripts from past sessions persist in ~/.claude/projects/. A cross-session reference would look like:\n\nSuggested UX: Claude checks the current session transcript first (fast, local, cheap). If no match, Claude prompts the user: \"I don't have that detail in the current session. Want me to search previous session transcripts?\" User opts in → Claude searches across session transcripts using indexed references. This respects the user's token budget while providing a clean escalation path.\n\nMEMORY.md behavioral nudge — Adding a rule in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md telling Claude to check the transcript when data feels incomplete. This works occasionally but depends on Claude being self-aware enough to recognize what it's lost, which it often can't. It's a behavioral hack, not an architectural fix.\n\nManual /compact with preservation instructions — e.g., /compact preserve all user-provided DOM markup. This is manual, not automated, and still produces lossy summaries.\n\nExisting proposals that address this differently:\n\n#17428 — File-backed summaries that write compacted content to new files for later retrieval. This proposal achieves the same goal with less machinery: the transcript already exists on disk, so rather than duplicating data into new files, annotate the summary with line-range pointers to the existing transcript. Same recoverability, zero additional storage.\n\n#15923 — Pre-compaction hook to archive transcripts before compaction. Useful for logging but doesn't solve the recovery problem — Claude still can't find what it lost.\n\n#21190 — Include last N interactions verbatim in the compact summary. Helps with recent context but doesn't scale to mid-session data and increases summary size.\n\n#6549 — Manual continuation prompts before compaction. Effective but entirely manual and user-dependent.\n\nCommunity workarounds: The MCP memory ecosystem (embedding stores, knowledge graphs, SQLite-backed recall) has dozens of projects working around this gap externally. These are all compensating for one missing capability: the compacted summary doesn't know where its source material lives. The indexed transcript reference approach solves it natively, at the platform layer, with zero additional infrastructure.\n\nHigh - Significant impact on productivity\n\nWith indexed transcript references:\n\nAt step 4, Claude sees [transcript:lines 847-1023] in the compacted summary, reads just those 177 lines from the transcript on disk, recovers the exact markup, and answers accurately. No re-paste, no guessing, no wasted tokens. The session continues as if compaction never happened.\n\nThe transcript already persists at ~/.claude/projects// — no new storage mechanism needed. This proposal adds metadata to the compaction summary, not infrastructure.\n\nImplementation scope is a modification to the compaction summarizer: emit summary lines with [transcript:lines X-Y] annotations, plus a recovery mechanism (file read with line offset) Claude can invoke on demand.\n\nToken cost is zero until recovery is triggered, and surgical when it is — only the specific compressed chunk gets loaded, not the full transcript.\n\nRelated issues (demand evidence):\n\nAt least 8 open bugs trace back to this same root cause — compaction summaries with no back-reference to source:\n\n#1534, #3021, #10960, #13919, #14968, #19888, #21105, #23620\n\nRelated feature requests (differentiation):\n\nPhase 2 extension (not the core ask, but worth noting): The same indexed mechanism generalizes across session transcripts for cross-session recovery. Default to current session lookup; prompt the user before searching prior sessions. Same architecture, wider scope.",

    "fullText": "It has long been the case that the person sitting next to you on an airplane may have paid a very different price for their seat than you did. For two reasons. First, airlines don’t price seats – they price itineraries. A seat from London to New York may be priced very differently depending on whether it’s one-way, one-half of a round trip, or one stage in a larger, multi-stage journey. Second, however, airlines are sophisticated about maximizing the value of your seat, responding to patterns of peak travel (Thanksgiving, August), when you buy it, and other factors. Despite their complexity, those prices are supposed to be based on published tariffs that anyone can, in theory, calculate for themselves and come up with the same answer.\n\nIn 2012, travel and data privacy expert Edward Hasbrouck explained all this as part of documenting and opposing the airlines’ desire to move to personalized pricing. Instead of acting as common carriers and publishing tariffs that apply across the board, with personalized pricing the airlines would use the information they have about you to charge what you can and would be willing to pay. In 2012, the International Air Transportation Association called it “New Distribution Capability”.\n\nThis is a much scarier proposition now than it was then; companies have a lot more data they can exploit. In 2012, they might simply have known your flying habits and credit score, while balancing their desire to get the most they can for the seat against the time they have left to sell it. Uber uses similar tactics; it raises the price of a ride – “surge pricing”, or “dynamic pricing” – when demand is high.\n\nToday, an airline might know – or be able to find out – that you are racing against time to see a beloved relative before they die. And why should it stop with airlines? Exploitative possibilities abound.\n\nUber has already been dubiously accused of charging more when riders’ phone batteries are low. Retailers collect shopping histories through loyalty cards and apps; often customers already pay more for opting out.\n\nSome types of price discrimination have long been illegal under consumer protection law. On February 12, US senators Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) introduced the Stop Price Gouging in Grocery Stores Act of 2026 to block it in grocery stores. Other efforts are also underway in the US. This week’s news is calling this “surveillance pricing” or “predatory pricing”, which accurately reflects the data collection and surveillance capitalism underpinning.\n\nThis is not really a story about specific technologies, although “AI”; the issue is, as Hasbrouck writes, opacity and discrimination.\n\nThe technological pieces are in place to make this all much worse. Not just online, where prices are easily generated on the fly, but also in real-world retailers via wireless connections and electronic shelf tags, which already exist in some stores. A May 2025 study finds that these tags are so far not used to implement surge pricing but to update sale prices and offer discounts – but for how long?\n\nIn a May 2025 paper in the International Journal of Research in Marketing researchers examine the rise of algorithmic pricing – Uber, landlords, retailers – generally and personalized pricing in particular. The authors note that the latter requires market power, and buyers must have limited ability to exploit price differences. And also: it’s profitable (duh). The authors go on to discuss the role of privacy, data protection, consumer laws, and backlash, in curbing unfairness. At Big, which focuses on consolidation and market power, Matt Stoller warns of the potential power of Google’s plan to run pricing strategies for advertisers.\n\nHasbrouck returned to the subject last year while recapping the latest season of The Amazing Race to explain the airlines’ use of systems that deliver increasingly opaque and unpredictable pricing and the lack of enforcement enabling it.\n\nIn a pair of posts, the ACLU’s Jay Stanley follows Hasbrouck’s logic to new levels, laying out a possible future these developments may bring. The desire to wring every last possible bit of profit out of us – we’re talking everyone who sells goods or services now, not just airlines – in Stanley’s view will lead to collecting more and more detailed data. The digital identification infrastructure being built into airports – as planned here in 2013 and shown arriving in 2022 – will ensure there is no countermeasure we can take to escape monitoring and data collection. In Stanley’s projection, stores will be able to demand a digital identification sign-in as a condition of entry.\n\nAgain, a bit of this is here already. In the UK, Facewatch, which we first encountered in 2013, is used by some major retailers to identify and bar shoppers who have previously been caught shoplifting or being violent. Recently, the system flagged a shopper and staff ousted the wrong person, who found it difficult to prove the mistake.\n\nIn other words, all these technologies, wrapped up together, could enable a world not much different from that imagined by Ira Levin in his 1970 book This Perfect Day, where everything anyone wanted to do required permission from a centralized system. Although: the key to making that work was drugging the entire population.\n\nIllustrations: Burmese python in Florida, 2011 (via Wikimedia).\n\nWendy M. Grossman is an award-winning journalist.

    "fullText": "Figure 1: JPEG produced with DALL-E 4o\n\nEvery engineer I've worked with has used the phrase \"technical debt\", but everyone seems to have a different notion of what this phrase actually means. I've also found the phrase to be quite controversial, sparking knee jerk reactions that cut short any meaningful discussions around how to improve codebases and the systems they precipitate.\n\nIn general, I feel the term has become a catch-all for anything in a codebase that someone doesn't like – messy code, missing tests, old frameworks, that one service nobody wants to touch, that slow CI in a repo that everyone has to touch…. This imprecision isn't just sloppy language – it's actively harmful. When everything is \"tech debt,\" nothing is, and teams lose the ability to reason clearly about what to fix, when to fix it, and whether to fix it at all.\n\nWhen everything is \"tech debt,\" nothing is, and teams lose the ability to reason clearly about what to fix, when to fix it, and whether to fix it at all.\n\nThis post reclaims the financial metaphor that Ward Cunningham originally intended1, extends it with precise mappings to financial instruments, and proposes concrete management strategies that scale from a two-person startup to a thousand-engineer enterprise.\n\nThe key insight elicidated in this post, and the main subject of my argument, is that the real danger isn't the debt itself – it's the interest. This post will be useful to you because, if you are like most teams, you likely don't know your interest rate.\n\nTechnical debt is a deliberate deviation from an optimal design that yields short-term value at the cost of increased future work.\n\nLike financial debt, it has principal (the cost to fix), interest (the ongoing drag), and an interest rate (the frequency with which you interact with the debt multiplied by the friction it causes).\n\nThe problem isn't taking on debt – it's failing to manage the interest. This post provides a framework for classifying, measuring, and paying down technical debt at any organizational scale.\n\nIn 1992, Ward Cunningham presented an experience report at OOPSLA describing the development of a financial portfolio management system in Smalltalk. He needed to justify ongoing refactoring to his business stakeholders, so he reached for a an unironically relevant metaphor they'd understand1:\n\nShipping first time code is like going into debt. A little debt speeds development so long as it is paid back promptly with a rewrite… The danger occurs when the debt is not repaid. Every minute spent on not-quite-right code counts as interest on that debt. – Ward Cunningham\n\nNotice what he didn't say. He didn't say \"writing bad code is like going into debt.\" He said shipping code before you fully understand the problem domain is like going into debt. The distinction matters enormously.\n\nCunningham was describing something specific: the team had built a working system, and through the process of building it, they had learned things about the domain that the code didn't yet reflect. The code worked. It was well-written. But it encoded an earlier, incomplete understanding of the problem. The \"debt\" was the gap between what the team now understood and what the code expressed.\n\nThis is a much more subtle – and much more useful – concept than \"the code is messy.\"\n\nBuilding on Cunningham's original insight, and drawing from a decade of subsequent refinement by Martin Fowler, Philippe Kruchten, and others, here's the definition I use:\n\nTechnical debt is a deliberate or accidental deviation from an optimal design that yields short-term value at the cost of increased future work.\n\nTechnical debt is a deliberate or accidental deviation from an optimal design that yields short-term value at the cost of increased future work.\n\nFurthermore, technical debt has four essential properties:\n\nThat last point is critical. A mortgage isn't reckless. Neither is shipping a prototype with hardcoded configuration to validate a business hypothesis. The question isn't whether to take on debt. It's whether you know you're doing it, and whether you have a plan to service it.\n\nPrecision matters here. Conflating these concepts with tech debt dilutes the metaphor to uselessness.\n\nThe litmus test: does this thing have both a principal (cost to fix) and an interest rate (ongoing cost of not fixing it)? If it only has a principal and no meaningful interest, it's not debt – it's just cleanup work. If it has interest but no meaningful principal (you can't fix it), it's a constraint, not debt.\n\nThe power of Cunningham's metaphor is that finance has centuries of well-developed theory for managing debt. But most engineers use the analogy at the level of \"debt = bad, pay it off\" – which is about as sophisticated as saying \"mortgages are bad, never buy a house.\"\n\nLet's map the concepts precisely.\n\nA key insight falls out of this mapping:\n\nHigh-interest debt is debt that compounds every time you touch it.\n\nHigh-interest debt is debt that compounds every time you touch it. The auth module you hack around daily costs orders of magnitude more than the deployment script you run quarterly – even if the deployment script's remediation cost (principal) is lower. This is why prioritizing debt paydown by \"ease of fix\" is backwards. You should prioritize by interest rate.\n\nNot all debt is created equal, and not all debt should be treated the same way.\n\nHere are a few high level categories:\n\nFinancial analog: a 30-year fixed mortgage.\n\nThis is stable code that is architecturally imperfect but rarely touched. For example, this could be a data ingestion pipeline written in Python 2 that runs once a month and processes CSV files. If it works and nobody modifies it, then the interest is near-zero because the frequency of interaction is near-zero.\n\nManagement strategy: leave it alone. Seriously. Refactoring this is like paying off a 2% mortgage early when you have 20% credit card debt. It's mathematically silly.\n\nFinancial analog: credit card debt.\n\nThis is the core module that every team touches daily and everyone hates. For example, the ORM that requires three workarounds per query, or the authentication layer that breaks in every test environment, or the deployment pipeline that takes 45 minutes and fails 20% of the time.\n\nI once worked on a team where the API gateway had been \"temporarily\" written as a single Express.js middleware file. Every team in the company routed through it. Every feature that touched authentication, rate limiting, or request validation required modifying that file. We had merge conflicts on it daily. The file was 3,000 lines long. The principal to fix it – decomposing it into proper middleware layers – was maybe two weeks of focused work. We deferred it for eighteen months because no sprint ever had \"room.\" By the end, we estimated that the accumulated interest – in merge conflicts, debugging time, and incidents caused by accidental regressions in that file – had cost us closer to six months of engineering time. Two weeks of principal. Six months of interest. That's a 1,200% annual rate.\n\nManagement strategy: pay this down immediately. Every day you don't costs more than the day before, because interest compounds with each interaction. This is where the \"just ship it\" mentality becomes catastrophically expensive.\n\nFinancial analog: an adjustable-rate mortgage.\n\nThis is debt whose cost changes based on external factors. A system that works fine at current scale but will collapse at 10x. Hardcoded assumptions about single-region deployment. A data pipeline that assumes English-only text.\n\nThe interest rate is low today but will spike when conditions change – a new market, a compliance requirement, a viral moment. The danger is that by the time the rate spikes, the principal has grown too.\n\nManagement strategy: cap your exposure. You don't need to fix it now, but you need to know about it and have a plan. Architecture decision records (ADRs) are your friend here – they document the assumptions that, when violated, will trigger a rate increase.\n\nFinancial analog: off-balance-sheet liabilities (the kind that caused the 2008 financial crisis).\n\nThis is the scariest kind. Tribal knowledge that exists only in one engineer's head. Undocumented invariants that the code silently depends on. A deployment process that only works because of a specific order of operations that nobody has written down.\n\nHidden debt is the technical equivalent of off-balance-sheet liabilities – the kind that brought down Lehman Brothers. You don't know about it until it explodes.\n\nManagement strategy: incognito leverage too dangerous – make it visible. Do bus factor analysis, documentation sprints, runbooks, chaos engineering – anything that surfaces hidden assumptions. You can't manage debt you can't see.\n\nTechnical debt doesn't appear and disappear in a single event — it follows a lifecycle. The diagram below traces debt from the moment it's incurred through a decision point where teams choose one of five responses. Notice the feedback loops: deferred debt compounds back into accruing interest, and even \"resolved\" debt eventually gives way to new debt as the system evolves.\n\nMartin Fowler's Technical Debt Quadrant provides the best taxonomy I've seen for why debt gets created. It classifies debt along two axes: deliberate vs. inadvertent and prudent vs. reckless2.\n\nEach quadrant requires a different response:\n\nIt's important to resist the temptation to moralize about technical debt. In many contexts, taking on debt is the right decision:\n\nTech debt is often a sign of rational decision-making under uncertainty – not incompetence.\n\nThis is the framing I use with stakeholders, and it changes the conversation immediately. Instead of \"we need to clean up the code\" (which sounds like an engineering vanity project), it becomes \"we need to manage our financial exposure\" (which sounds like responsible governance).\n\nMost teams think about technical debt in terms of principal – \"how hard would it be to fix this?\" They estimate the cost of a refactor, put it on the backlog, and let it sit there because it never outranks the next feature.\n\nBut the principal is static. The interest is what kills you. And interest compounds.\n\nAvoid metrics theater. Lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, and lint scores are proxies at best and noise at worst. The following signals are more useful for measuring the interest on your technical debt:\n\nThese signals map directly to interest, not principal. A system with high change amplification and a high fear factor is accruing massive interest, regardless of how \"easy\" the fix would be.\n\nInterest on technical debt compounds in ways that are genuinely analogous to financial compound interest. Consider a module with a 10% \"tax\" – every feature touching this module takes 10% longer than it should.\n\nHacking around debt like trying to kill a mythological hydra – the effort is herculean, but the problem only grows with each swing of the engineer's sword.\n\nIn isolation, 10% sounds manageable. But compound it:\n\nThis is how a 10% tax becomes a 50% tax in 18 months. I've seen this exact pattern play out at multiple companies. Hacking around debt like trying to kill a mythological hydra – the effort is herculean, but the problem only grows with each swing of the engineer's sword. If the banner image of this blog post reminds you of a terrifying hydra, then I've accomplished my goal of being illustrious.\n\nThe chart above models three scenarios over five years. The red line shows what happens when debt is left unmanaged – a 10% velocity tax compounds into a 50%+ tax within a few years. The yellow line shows moderate, consistent debt service. The green line shows aggressive front-loaded paydown that levels off once the worst debt is addressed.\n\nThe takeaway: the earlier you start servicing debt, the cheaper it is. Just like a mortgage.\n\nThe compounding effect isn't just an analogy – it's a law of software evolution.\n\nLehman's laws of software evolution, established empirically in the 1970s and validated repeatedly since, state that4:\n\nLaw #2 is the kicker. Complexity doesn't increase because engineers are careless. It increases because that's what happens to systems that interact with the real world. Entropy is the default. Order requires energy. This is as true in software as it is in thermodynamics.\n\nEntropy is the default. Order requires energy.\n\nTechnical debt, in this framing, is unreduced complexity – the delta between the system's current complexity and the minimum complexity needed to serve its current purpose. Interest is the ongoing cost of carrying that excess complexity. And Lehman tells us that without deliberate effort, that delta only grows.\n\nSo the debt compounds. The interest accrues. Lehman's second law tells us complexity grows by default. The natural question is: what do you actually do about it?\n\nThe right approach depends heavily on context. A strategy that's right for a 500-person engineering org can be lethal for a 5-person startup, and vice versa.\n\nThis is where debt management gets serious, and where I've seen the most damage done. At one growth-stage company I worked with, the engineering team tripled in a year. The codebase they inherited from the startup phase was a classic \"clean interfaces, dirty internals\" system – which had been fine at 8 engineers. But at 30, the dirty internals became a coordination bottleneck. Three teams would independently hack around the same internal limitation in three different ways, creating three new debt instruments per quarter. The startup-era debt didn't grow linearly with headcount – it grew quadratically, because every new engineer was another node in the collision graph.\n\nYou're past the point where everyone knows everything, but not yet at the scale where platform teams and formal governance make sense. This is the most dangerous stage.\n\nAllocate fixed capacity for debt service. 15-25% of engineering capacity, every sprint, non-negotiable. This is not a \"20% time\" passion project. This is interest payments. McKinsey's research found that organizations with systematic debt management freed up engineers to spend up to 50% more time on value-generating work5.\n\nAt enterprise scale, technical debt becomes systemic risk. Individual modules matter less than system-level friction: API boundaries, deployment pipelines, shared libraries, and the organizational structures that produce them.\n\nNotice how the allocation to debt service increases with company size. This is counterintuitive – you'd think larger companies with more resources could afford less proportional debt spending. But larger companies have more accumulated debt, more system boundaries where debt hides, and higher coordination costs. The 5% a startup spends is \"fix it when you see it.\" The 25% an enterprise spends is \"dedicated teams, formal processes, migration projects.\"\n\nOne of the most powerful reframings in this entire financial analogy:\n\nRefactoring is not \"paying off\" debt. It's refinancing it.\n\nWhen you refinance a mortgage, you don't eliminate the debt. You replace one debt instrument with another that has better terms – lower interest rate, more predictable payments, better aligned with your current financial situation.\n\nGood refactoring does the same thing:\n\nThis reframing matters because it changes the conversation with stakeholders. \"We need to stop feature work for 3 months to clean up the code\" is a hard sell. \"We're refinancing – we'll reduce our ongoing maintenance costs by 30%, freeing up 2 engineers' worth of capacity for new features\" is a business case.\n\nNo discussion of technical debt in 2026 is complete without addressing the elephant in the IDE: AI code assistants.\n\nGitHub Copilot, Claude, and their cousins have fundamentally changed the economics of code production. Writing code is now cheaper and faster than ever. But cheaper production doesn't mean cheaper ownership – and this is where the financial analogy becomes urgent.\n\nGitClear's 2025 research on AI-assisted code quality found11:\n\nGoogle's 2024 DORA report corroborates: teams with higher AI adoption reported faster code review and improved documentation, but the same cohort showed a measurable decrease in delivery stability3.\n\nIn financial terms: AI assistants have massively increased the rate at which teams can issue new debt, while simultaneously reducing the rate at which existing debt gets serviced.\n\nThe mechanism is straightforward:\n\nThis creates a specific new type of debt that deserves its own name: comprehension debt.\n\nAI assistants have massively increased the rate at which teams can issue new debt, while simultaneously reducing the rate at which existing debt gets serviced.\n\nComprehension debt is the gap between the size of a codebase and any individual engineer's ability to hold a working mental model of it. Traditional technical debt is about code that's wrong – suboptimal designs that create friction. Comprehension debt is about code that might be individually correct but is collectively unintelligible. Each AI-generated function may work perfectly, but when 40% of the codebase was written by an LLM that doesn't know your team's conventions, the overall architecture drifts toward incoherence – ten different patterns for error handling, six ways to call the same API, three duplicate utility functions that almost-but-do-not-quite do the same thing.\n\nThe insidious property of comprehension debt is that it can't be addressed by traditional refactoring. You can't \"fix\" a codebase that nobody can hold in their head. The debt isn't in any individual module – it's in the aggregate. The principal doesn't show up in any static analysis tool, and the interest manifests as slower onboarding, more bugs from unexpected interactions, and a growing sense among senior engineers that \"nobody really knows how this system works anymore.\"\n\nHere's the uncomfortable truth that most engineers don't want to hear:\n\nTechnical debt is often a management and incentive problem, not a technical one.\n\nConway's Law states that organizations design systems that mirror their own communication structures8. The implication for technical debt is profound: organizational friction becomes architectural friction becomes technical debt.\n\nIf teams A and B can't communicate efficiently, the interface between their services will accrue debt – duplicated logic, mismatched assumptions, undocumented contracts. The debt isn't caused by poor engineering. It's caused by poor organizational design. And no amount of refactoring will fix it, because the structure that created the debt will recreate it.\n\nThe Inverse Conway Maneuver – deliberately restructuring teams to match the desired architecture – is the only way to address this class of debt. It's also politically difficult, which is why this debt tends to persist.\n\nTechnical debt grows fastest in organizations with these incentive patterns:\n\nTech debt grows fastest where engineers feel powerless to address it. If your process doesn't allocate time for debt service, debt will accumulate. This is not a technical problem. It's a governance problem.\n\nThe most pernicious version of this: organizations that say they value quality but measure only velocity. Engineers quickly learn which metric actually matters, and they optimize accordingly.\n\nLet's pull everything together into a practical framework.\n\nYou can't manage what you can't see. Build a simple inventory:\n\nDon't over-engineer this. A spreadsheet or a markdown file (or org-mode file if you're cool like me 🤪) in the repo is fine. The point is visibility, not process.\n\nSort your inventory by interest rate, not by principal. The debt that every team interacts with daily costs more than the debt that one team encounters quarterly, even if the quarterly debt has a higher remediation cost.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt Priority Score} = \\text{Interest Rate} \\times \\text{Number of Affected Teams} \\times \\text{Interaction Frequency}\n\\]\n\nThis isn't meant to be precise – it's meant to force the right conversation.\n\nDecide on a fixed percentage of engineering capacity for debt service. This should be:\n\nIn practice, I've seen this work best when the allocation is protected at the team level, not the org level. Telling 50 teams \"the org is allocating 20% to debt\" is meaningless. Telling each team \"20% of your sprints go to debt service, and here's how we'll track the impact\" creates accountability.\n\nFor each debt paydown initiative, define:\n\nTrack these before and after. This builds the institutional evidence base for continued debt service investment.\n\nHere's a concrete example: suppose you're refactoring the authentication module. Before starting, measure: average PR size for auth-touching features (say, 15 files), average time from \"code complete\" to \"merged\" (say, 4 days), and staging failure rate for auth changes (say, 25%). Set targets: reduce PR size to <8 files, merge time to <2 days, staging failures to <10%. After two sprints of focused refactoring, measure again. If the metrics moved, you have evidence. If they didn't, you're either fixing the wrong thing or the refactor isn't done yet.\n\nPaydown without prevention is a treadmill. Implement:\n\nLet me end with the thesis I promised at the start:\n\nYou don't eliminate technical debt. You structure it.\n\nEvery financial system carries debt. Healthy companies have mortgages, lines of credit, and corporate bonds. The difference between a healthy company and a bankrupt one isn't the presence of debt – it's the management of it. Healthy companies know their debt-to-equity ratio, their interest obligations, and their capacity to service existing debt before taking on more.\n\nThe same is true for codebases.\n\nA healthy codebase has known, documented debt with managed interest rates, owned by specific teams, prioritized by business impact, and systematically paid down. An unhealthy codebase has the same amount of debt but nobody can tell you what it is, how much it costs, or who's responsible.\n\nEvery system carries debt. The question is who pays, when, and how predictably.\n\nThe financial analogy isn't perfect. No analogy is. But it gives us a vocabulary – principal, interest, refinancing, credit rating – that makes the invisible visible and the abstract concrete. It transforms \"we have a lot of tech debt\" from a vague complaint into a specific, actionable diagnosis: what is the debt, what is the interest rate, and what is our plan for servicing it?\n\nStart there. The rest follows.\n\nCunningham's original insight was that shipping code creates a gap between what you've built and what you now understand. Thirty-four years later, the insight holds – but the gap has widened. We ship faster, understand later, and compound the difference daily. The metaphor he gave us is still the best tool we have for closing it. Use it precisely, and it will serve you well.\n\nThis post reclaims Ward Cunningham's original financial metaphor for technical debt and extends it into a comprehensive framework for managing code quality at any organizational scale.\n\nThe core argument begins with a precise definition: technical debt is a deliberate or accidental deviation from an optimal design that yields short-term value at the cost of increased future work. Critically, not everything that frustrates engineers is debt—bugs are liabilities, legacy systems are only debt if they impede change, and \"bad code\" is a style preference unless it causes measurable drag.\n\nThe post maps technical concepts to financial instruments with precision: principal is remediation cost, interest is ongoing friction, and the interest rate is interaction frequency multiplied by system friction. This leads to a taxonomy of debt types—low-interest long-term debt (like a mortgage), high-interest revolving debt (like credit cards), variable-rate debt whose costs spike under changing conditions, and dangerous hidden debt that lurks off the balance sheet.\n\nMartin Fowler's quadrant classifies debt by whether it was deliberate or inadvertent, prudent or reckless—each requiring different responses. The post argues that debt is often rational, especially for startups validating product-market fit or teams exploring uncertain requirements.\n\nThe central thesis emerges in the section on interest: the real danger isn't the debt itself but the compounding interest. The post provides practical signals for measuring interest—change amplification, time-to-confidence, fear factor, and rework rate—and illustrates how a 10% velocity tax can become 50% in 18 months through compound effects that Lehman's Laws predict are inevitable without deliberate countermeasures.\n\nManagement strategies vary by company stage: startups should accept higher interest rates while avoiding irreversible debt, growth-stage companies must allocate 15-25% of capacity to debt service, and enterprises need platform teams functioning as internal lenders with enforced contracts at system boundaries.\n\nThe post reframes refactoring as refinancing rather than cleanup—replacing one debt instrument with another that has better terms—and distinguishes good refinancing (incremental, measurable) from bad (big-bang rewrites, cosmetic changes).\n\nA timely section addresses AI-generated code as a new debt accelerator, introducing the concept of \"comprehension debt\"—the gap between codebase size and any engineer's ability to maintain a working mental model. The data shows AI tools have increased code production while reducing refactoring activity, creating a dangerous imbalance.\n\nOrganizational factors often matter more than technical ones: Conway's Law means organizational friction becomes architectural friction becomes debt, while incentive misalignment (rewarding only shipping, no ownership past delivery) accelerates accumulation.\n\nThe post concludes with a five-step framework: inventory your debt, prioritize by interest rate rather than principal, allocate fixed non-negotiable capacity for debt service, execute with measurable targets, and prevent new high-interest debt through ADRs and architecture tests. The final message: you don't eliminate technical debt, you structure it—just as healthy companies carry managed debt with known obligations and clear ownership.\n\nWard Cunningham first described the debt metaphor in his 1992 OOPSLA experience report, \"The WyCash Portfolio Management System.\" He later clarified in a 2009 video that the metaphor was specifically about the gap between the team's evolving understanding and the code's current design – not about deliberately writing poor code.\n\nMartin Fowler's Technical Debt Quadrant (2009) built on Cunningham's original metaphor by distinguishing between deliberate/inadvertent and prudent/reckless debt. This taxonomy is now widely used in industry.\n\nGoogle's DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) program has tracked software delivery performance for over a decade. The 2024 State of DevOps report introduced rework rate as a fifth key metric and found mixed results from AI adoption: improved throughput but decreased stability. See: dora.dev.\n\nLehman's laws of software evolution were first proposed by Meir M. Lehman in 1974 and refined through the 1990s. The laws describe empirically observed properties of \"E-type\" systems (software that solves real-world problems). The key insight – that complexity increases unless explicitly counteracted – has been validated across decades of research. See: Wikipedia: Lehman's Laws.\n\nMcKinsey's 2023 report \"Breaking technical debt's vicious cycle to modernize your business\" found that technical debt consumes a significant share of IT budgets – CIOs surveyed reported that as much as 40% of their technology estate was composed of tech debt. Organizations with systematic debt management freed engineers to spend up to 50% more time on value-generating work. One CIO reported reducing the \"debt tax\" on engineer time from 75% to 25%.\n\nArchitecture Decision Records (ADRs) were popularized by Michael Nygard in a 2011 blog post. The format is simple: Context, Decision, Consequences. The key value is recording the context so future engineers understand why the decision was made, not just what it was.\n\nFor a deep dive on schema languages as an interface-level debt prevention strategy, see my companion post: The Schema Language Question: Avro, JSON Schema, Protobuf, and the Quest for a Single Source of Truth.\n\nConway's Law, introduced by Melvin Conway in 1967, states that \"organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.\" Research from MIT and Harvard Business School found \"strong evidence to support the mirroring hypothesis.\" See: Wikipedia: Conway's Law.\n\nThe Strangler Fig pattern was named by Martin Fowler in his 2004 blog post, inspired by the strangler fig trees he observed in Australia. The pattern involves building a new system around the edges of the old, gradually routing traffic from old to new, until the old system can be decommissioned.\n\nJoel Spolsky's \"Things You Should Never Do, Part I\" (2000) argues that full rewrites are \"the single worst strategic mistake that any software company can make,\" citing Netscape's decision to rewrite their browser from scratch as a cautionary tale. The argument is that working code, however ugly, embodies years of accumulated knowledge about edge cases and failure modes that a rewrite will inevitably lose.\n\nGitClear's \"AI Copilot Code Quality: 2025 Data Suggests 4x Growth in Code Clones\" analyzed over 200 million lines of changed code to measure the impact of AI assistants on code quality metrics. The findings suggest that AI tools are accelerating code production while reducing refactoring activity, leading to increased duplication and higher churn rates.",

    "title": "Kansas City moved to close a downtown nuisance business. It hasn’t worked | Opinion",
    "description": "Five months after being labeled a nuisance, Downtown Market at 11th and Grand remains open despite city orders and an eviction. From David Hudnall:",
    "fullText": "For a business that was supposed to be on the brink of closure, Downtown Market is doing a brisk trade.\n\nFive months after the city labeled it a nuisance and the landlord moved to evict, the lights are on at 1103 Grand. The beer coolers hum. The liquor selection remains vast. The counter display still includes synthetic urine kits for anyone looking to game a drug test. Step outside the market, and you won’t struggle to find a sidewalk entrepreneur selling some of the substances those tests are meant to detect.\n\n“We’re still seeing all the same activity, dealing with all the same problems,” said Jason Swords, one of the owners of The Grand, a high-rise a few doors down. “We still find bottles of alcohol all over the place on the sidewalks every morning. There are vagrants everywhere. We still see people hiding in the alleyways, peeing on the sidewalks.”\n\nIt has not been for want of effort from those with authority to intervene.\n\nIn September, Public Safety Director Lace Cline sent Downtown Market a cease and desist letter giving the store 10 days to correct conditions the city said enabled “unrelenting, open, and notorious drug activity and public intoxication.” The letter cited 184 calls for service over two years — 101 of them disturbances — and referenced a January 2025 shooting inside the store.\n\nTwo months later, the building’s owner took the matter to Jackson County court. The Alexander Company, which owns the 16-story Professional Building where Downtown Market occupies the ground floor, filed suit seeking to give Downtown Market the boot. The landlord says it sent a notice of default in October, gave the tenant time to address multiple violations, then terminated the lease when it concluded the problems continued. It has asked a judge for possession of the space and back rent while the case plays out.\n\nThe city and the landlord have the same gripe: The lease envisioned something more like a grocery store for on-the-go downtown dwellers and workers. The operation on the ground moves mostly booze and attracts loose characters that have turned the block into something resembling a skid row.\n\nShawn Choudry, part of the management team that owns Downtown Market, has a different version of the story: This is a city problem, not a Downtown Market problem.\n\n“Downtown Market didn’t get 184 calls for service,” Choudry told me back in the fall. “This area did. The problems come from outside our store, not inside.”\n\nChoudry said this week that he preferred to let his countersuit against The Alexander Company do the talking for now. That complaint, filed in January, says the market’s owners poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into renovating the space and that its mix of groceries, alcohol and tobacco was approved from the start. It argues that, contrary to the landlord’s allegations, alcohol makes up less than half of sales and that much of the activity cited by the city happens at the bus stop across the street. It accuses the landlord of using the city’s nuisance designation as leverage to push them out of a long-term lease.\n\nThis fight probably burns hotter because of where it sits. The corner of 11th and Grand is a few blocks from the Power & Light District and T-Mobile Center, adjacent to the city’s financial district, and next door to the Ambassador Hotel. It is a part of downtown that’s supposed to feel stable and safe, a stretch of street the city will be showing off to visitors with the World Cup on the horizon.\n\nSwords and his investors at The Grand have been saying for months that the disorder around their building is bleeding into their balance sheet. They’ve asked PIEA, the city’s Planned Industrial Expansion Authority, for additional tax relief, arguing that shootings, street activity and constant repairs have made their $69 million investment increasingly difficult to sustain.\n\nPIEA hasn’t taken up that request yet; chair Tom Porto told me this week that he expects it to come before the board later this spring. I imagine Kansas City Public Schools and other taxing jurisdictions that would forgo revenue in such a deal are unlikely to shrug quietly at the prospect of extending further relief to a project already enjoying a substantial tax break.\n\nSwords said he has noticed a stronger police presence in recent months. He credits officers for spending more time on the block and the city for trying to take action against Downtown Market, even if the day-to-day street scene still looks familiar to him.\n\nOn my own drop-ins over the past few months, the store does appear to be on slightly better behavior. The supply of kratom products and other “gas station drugs” has been cleared out, and I’m not seeing loosies or airplane bottles moving across the counter.\n\nHis complaints are backed up by the call data regardless. I asked KCPD for calls to service to the address since the cease and desist went out in September. Between late August and mid-February, police logged 215 calls — including most commonly disturbances (69), followed by advice or non-emergency calls (56). At least 10 incidents involved weapons, and more than 40 required fire or EMS response.\n\nI asked Mayor Quinton Lucas Wednesday where the city stands on the matter, and got a statement heavy on legal phrasing. The plain-English version reads something like: The city intends to keep citing and pushing for compliance while the landlord-tenant case works its way through court, and it hasn’t ruled out shutting the place down if conditions don’t improve. It has made a similar move at least once in recent years, when it closed an illegal nightclub on Prospect Avenue after a shooting.\n\nBut it remains hard to know how much the issue involves Downtown Market customers versus people who would be on that corner regardless. Closing Downtown Market might remove one piece of the puzzle. But the corner sits at the intersection of much bigger problems in the city: chronic homelessness, addiction and a mismanaged KCPD budget that has started to make sustained community policing feel like a luxury. One padlock won’t solve all that.",

    "fullText": "Investigators examining last year’s deadly Air India Flight 171 crash in Ahmedabad have concluded the disaster was caused by the pilot in command deliberately moving both engine fuel control switches to cutoff, according to a report published Thursday.\n\nThe Boeing 787 Dreamliner lost thrust seconds after takeoff and crashed into a medical student hostel on June 12, 2025, killing 241 people on board and 19 on the ground. The report cites cockpit voice and flight data recordings that allegedly show manual shutdown of both engines despite no evidence of mechanical failure.\n\nBlack box data under review: The aircraft’s cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered days after the crash and sent for detailed analysis as part of the investigation led by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau with technical assistance from U.S. and U.K. authorities. The Boeing 787 was powered by twin engines and equipped with electronically controlled fuel systems that require intentional manual input to change fuel flow settings. Investigators have examined parameters including throttle position, engine core speed and fuel flow rates to determine the sequence of events in the seconds between liftoff and impact.\n\nMental health scrutiny surfaces: The report also claims that Captain Sumeet Sabharwal had experienced depression in the months before the crash, citing unnamed sources familiar with the inquiry. Sabharwal’s family has publicly rejected assertions about his mental health and called for a fresh and impartial investigation. Pilot associations in India previously objected to earlier reports suggesting pilot responsibility, urging authorities to avoid attributing blame before the final report is issued.\n\nTrending on NextShark: AI research boom draws scrutiny after single author claims 113 papers in one year\n\nLegal questions emerge: The crash has prompted scrutiny beyond the technical investigation, including reports that Air India has offered financial settlements to some victims’ families. According to separate media accounts, the offers allegedly included provisions limiting the ability to pursue legal action against the airline and the aircraft manufacturer. Air India has not publicly detailed the terms of any such agreements, and the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau has yet to release its final determination of cause.\n\nThis story is part of The Rebel Yellow Newsletter — a bold weekly newsletter from the creators of NextShark, reclaiming our stories and celebrating Asian American voices.\n\nTrending on NextShark: Minority psychologist coalition challenges Jewish ethnic recognition within APA\n\nSubscribe free to join the movement.

    "description": "Consumers should stop using the product immediately.",
    "fullText": "Freeze-dried food and treats have become a popular feeding option for both cats and dogs. The food provides a better delivery system for nutrients to your pets without the downsides of raw food, which can pose a salmonella risk.\n\nHowever, freeze-dried foods are not exempt from recalls. One popular cat food brand recently issued a voluntary recall for their freeze-dried chicken cat nuggets. It wasn't for bacterial contamination, though. This recall was due to a possible vitamin deficiency.\n\n🐶\nView the complete details on this recall at: https://t.co/E5Zy1sSKuI pic.twitter.com/pSb6bD7qW0\n\n— U.S. FDA Recalls (@FDArecalls) February 18, 2026\n\nIf your cat is eating the Quest Cat Food Chicken Recipe, you need to check your pantry. The voluntary recall affects one specific lot: C25288 with the UPC: 6-91730-18103-1 and a Best Buy Date of 10/15/2027. The zip-lock bags were sold in Colorado, Utah, Washington, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Michigan, California, Texas and Illinois. The affected batch may have low thiamine levels, also known as vitamin B1.\n\nThe recall of the freeze-dried nuggets was triggered after a cat owner reported illness in their cat. Thankfully, a veterinarian treated the cat, and it has recovered. So far, it is the only cat to have experienced adverse effects from the product.\n\nThe product was tested by the veterinarian who treated the ill cat, and the test indicated that the lot did not meet the required thiamine levels to support a cat's diet. Quest conducted further testing to verify that the lot may have low thiamine levels. Quest's parent company, Go Raw LLC, has already taken measures to ensure that this doesn't happen again.\n\nThiamine is considered an essential nutrient for cats. According to a 2017 study, the water-soluble vitamin helps animals process carbohydrates, synthesize nucleotides, and maintain normal nervous system function. Since they can't produce the vitamin on their own, they need to consume at least 0.33 to 0.35 milligrams per day to maintain healthy levels.\n\nWhile deficiencies can be reversed if caught early enough, they can lead to severe medical issues. According to the FDA's press release, cats' nervous systems and stomachs can be affected. \"Early signs of thiamine deficiency may include decreased appetite, salivation, vomiting, failure to grow, and weight loss,\" the release said. \"In advanced cases, neurological signs may develop, including ventroflexion (bending towards the floor) of the neck, mental dullness, vision changes, wobbly walking, circling, falling, and seizures.\"\n\nIf not treated in time, cats can also become so ill that they die from their symptoms. Go Raw LLC has said that consumers should immediately stop using the product and return it to the store where it was purchased for a full refund. If you have any questions, you can email the company at cs@gorawllc.com or call them at (801) 432-7478, Monday through Friday, 9 am to 4 p.m. MST.",

    "fullText": "The car market can often defy logic. As we are aware, buying used saves money in general, as new cars lose a potential 30% of their value within two years. Yet, this isn't always the case: some used models often sell for above the MSRP of their newer rivals.\n\nIt doesn't make sense, but there are reasons for this. For instance, inventory may have been disrupted by market events, such as the 2022 semiconductor shortage. Moreover, when demand outstrips supply, certain vehicles become more desirable, which only drives wider interest.\n\nWhich cars make the grade for this unique selection? Using the latest iSeeCars listings data, among other sources, we have compiled this fleet of stalwarts. As you can probably guess, Toyota is quite the overperformer.\n\nIf you're looking for a new car to get you from point A to B and back, these might be worth considering.\n\nThe Ford Maverick boasts a hybrid powertrain option that can deliver strong fuel economy and a modest tow rating that still handles everyday tasks. As a selling point, it is one of the few pickups appealing broadly from daily commute to weekend jobs. This used car has an astonishingly high price difference over a new model: around 12.3% and an average $4,038 increase.\n\nMoreover, its smaller footprint makes city parking easier, and standard features like smartphone integration and a comfortable cabin extend its value on the used market. It is clearly a very popular used car choice. According to Drew Dorian at Car and Driver, the Maverick is \"a simple, honest truck with enough capability for casual truck drivers who don't need something the size of an F-150.\"\n\nToyota's Corolla Hybrid has quietly become one of the most efficient compact sedans/SUV alternatives on the road. Of course, it is just one reason why used examples can fetch prices well above their new counterparts in recent listings.\n\nIn its 2026 review, Car and Driver observed that the Corolla Hybrid can deliver fuel economy into the 50+ mpg range. Such an irresistible economy makes it stand out among compact vehicles, where efficiency and cost rule the roost. That blend of everyday thrift and strong reliability has translated into strong demand for lightly used units. It goes without saying that Toyota's hybrid technology has decades of consistent performance under its belt, which translates to trust in the used market.\n\nLike its Japanese rival, Toyota, Mercedes has already convinced us how much we can trust them. The company's reputation for durability means buying used comes with few doubts. The Mercedes-Benz G-Class is no exception and arguably the premier example of a luxury SUV whose used pricing often exceeds new MSRP on dealership listings.\n\nThis outcome is particularly true for low-mileage AMG variants. The G-Class blends classic design with formidable off-road capability and premium amenities that appeal to enthusiasts and luxury buyers alike. According to Edmunds' appraisal data, a 2024/2025 G-Class can still command dealer retail values well into the high five figures and beyond.\n\nMinivans usually depreciate faster than SUVs, so the Toyota Sienna is in a league of its own, and not just for this unique trait. For starters, it's one of the few modern minivans that never got replaced by SUVs, instead evolving into a hybrid-only platform that's both fuel-thrifty and family-friendly.\n\nThat reputation for practicality, combined with strong reliability, has led to very tight used-car inventories, keeping prices close to or above new MSRP in many markets.\n\nIn its 2025 coverage, MotorTrend's Bob Hernandez called the Sienna \"one of the most enduring people movers in North America,\" noting its efficient hybrid powertrain, generous interior space, and thoughtful tech upgrades, including larger infotainment screens and refined connectivity features.\n\nThe Toyota RAV4 Prime is the plug-in hybrid version of America's perennial SUV bestseller. This trusty little SUV is one of the models that still shows used pricing above new MSRP in the latest iSeeCars research. It's a reflection of the RAV4 Prime's demand among buyers who want both electric range and SUV utility.\n\nDrew Hardesty of the YouTube channel Car Confections cites the 2024 Prime as his all-around favorite SUV. He says it \"builds upon the already excellent formula of the Rav 4 hybrid and gives you that pure electric range and more performance without compromising really anything.\" The video estimates that a used 2024 RAV4 Prime retains a nice 65% of its resale value after five years, which is why these SUVs are hard to find.\n\nWhile often underrated against bigger siblings, the Toyota Corolla Cross has quietly boomed in popularity. The TCC is a small SUV with a big following and a solid performer in a small package, much like Prince before he departed the stage for good.\n\nIt has held its own so well that used prices have edged above new MSRP in national iSeeCars listings. Built on Toyota's reliable foundation, the Corolla Cross delivers comfortable seating, good visibility, and efficient performance: traits that buyers prize in a small SUV. There is a clear Toyota-shaped pattern emerging here.\n\nOfficially, Toyota's RAV4 is America's favorite SUV, according to AutoBlog's Jacob Oliva. It means that demand is at an all-time high, and inventory is tight. Added to this fact, RAV4s will go hybrid, pushing used demand even further.\n\nNot all used RAV4 Hybrid pricing comes from electrified variants: the standard RAV4 Hybrid also appears above new MSRP in some used listings. Owners can appreciate its smooth ride quality, good fuel economy, and adaptability from suburban roads to light off-road trails: a balance that can appeal to many buyers.\n\nWhile Japan's Toyota is unmatched for long-term auto investment, South Korea is never far behind. Kia's success has been palpable over the past two decades in the USA, and the Carnival's utilitarian design makes it one of the more popular models. With minivans less common than SUVs, buyers seeking maximum space without jumping to larger three-row SUVs have helped keep Carnival prices firm. Furthermore, it has the handling, feature content, and usability rather than sheer economy to promote resilience.\n\nJerry Seiner of Kia South Jordan in Utah reminds us why they are so popular. \"Kia vehicles are built to last, with high-quality materials and engineering designed for longevity,\" he writes. \"This focus on durability means that even older Kia models can perform well and maintain their aesthetic appeal over time.\"\n\nThis off-road icon with huge cult appeal has seen a revival this decade, making it one of Ford's recent success stories. Built on a rugged ladder frame, the Bronco offers multiple trim levels, powerful turbocharged engines, and authentic off-road capability with selectable drive modes designed to conquer terrain from sand to mud.\n\nFor an idea of which models will retain value best, perhaps this Everything Bronco Aftermarket review will enlighten. \"Models such as the Bronco Raptor with the top-spec V6 and the limited edition Ford Bronco Heritage Edition are likely to retain value the best,\" it reads.\n\nIf there's one vehicle that has turned depreciation into something of a practical joke, it's the Toyota Tacoma. This iconic midsize pickup has become America's go-to for reliability and longevity, rugged enough for weekend hauling but compact enough for daily use.\n\nThat reputation for durability and desirability means light-mileage used Tacomas are sometimes priced as high as or higher than new ones: a rare exception to the usual depreciation curve.\n\nKelley Blue Book's (KBB's) \"Best Resale Value Awards\" make clear that the 2025 Toyota Tacoma has a strong 64% resale value. This credential makes it highly in demand across the used car markets.",

    "description": "The court action brings an end to three years of negotiating by eight men, including Freeburg’s mayor.",
    "fullText": "Former Major League Baseball player Danny Cox and three other men have entered plea agreements on hunting citations issued three years ago on his property in rural Freeburg.\n\nThis brings an end to cases against eight men, including Freeburg Mayor Seth Speiser, in St. Clair County Circuit Court. Illinois Conservation Police had issued them a total of 29 citations and 22 written warnings after a monthlong investigation.\n\nThis week, Cox pleaded guilty to two of six alleged violations, according to court records. They include falsifying harvest records by using an archery permit issued to someone else, a Class A misdemeanor; and taking a 10-point buck with aid of bait, a Class B misdemeanor.\n\nAssociate Judge Maurche’ Belk fined Cox $700. She dismissed cases related to four other citations for allegedly placing bait for deer, firearm deer hunting with aid of bait, taking an 8-point buck with aid of bait and failing to wear blaze orange while hunting.\n\n“It was a prosecution that led to an outcome of guilt on the charges,” said Chris Allen, spokesman for State’s Attorney James Gomric’s office, which negotiated the plea agreements.\n\nConservation police, formerly known as game wardens, are part of the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. IDNR representatives declined to comment for this story.\n\nUnder an agency point system, Cox’s convictions on the two violations would result in 22 points against his hunting license and lead to a 22-month suspension of privileges.\n\nCox, 66, formerly pitched for the St. Louis Cardinals, Philadelphia Phillies and Toronto Blue Jays, and managed the Gateway Grizzlies. He didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nCox’s two sons, Kamdan and Kyle, and a fourth hunter, Steve Pate, entered similar plea agreements this week. All were represented by former State’s Attorney John Baricevic.\n\nSpeiser, 61, owns property next to 300 mostly wooded acres owned by the Cox family. The mayor, his son and another man entered plea agreements last month in St. Clair County Circuit Court.\n\nSpeiser pleaded guilty to placing bait for deer. Associate Judge L. Dominic Kujawa fined him $400, placed him on 12-month court supervision and dismissed cases related to three other citations for alleged taking of a white-tailed deer with aid of bait and firearm deer hunting with aid of bait.\n\nAll four charges against Speiser were Class B misdemeanors. Under Illinois law, each carried a maximum penalty of up to six months in jail and/or a fine of up to $1,500.\n\nIf Speiser completes supervision and isn’t cited for additional hunting violations in the next year, the first charge also will be dismissed, according to Allen. However, that won’t eliminate his penalties. The nine points against his hunting license don’t reach the 13-point threshold for suspension.\n\nHere are the results of the other plea agreements:\n\nKamdan Cox, 30, of Clarksville, Tennessee, pleaded guilty to one violation involving turkey hunting. He was fined $800. Belk dismissed cases related to six other citations.\n\nKyle Cox, 35, of Belleville, pleaded guilty to using a hunting license issued to someone else. He was fined $500. Belk dismissed cases related to two other citations.\n\nSteve Pate, 65, of Marietta, Georgia, pleaded guilty to archery deer hunting without a valid permit and unlawful taking of a 7-point buck. He was fined $600. Belk dismissed cases related to two other citations.\n\nMitchell Speiser, 28, of Freeburg, pleaded guilty to taking a protected species (white-tailed deer). He was fined $400 and placed on 12-month supervision. Kujawa dismissed a case related to one other citation.\n\nBrian Forrester, 38, of New Athens, pleaded guilty to firearm deer-hunting with aid of bait. He was fined $300 and placed on 12-month supervision. Kujawa dismissed a case related to one other citation.\n\nAn eighth hunter, Barry Northerner, 66, of Roswell, Georgia, pleaded guilty early on and paid a fine for failing to wear blaze orange instead of negotiating for a plea agreement.\n\nIllinois Conservation Police conducted the investigation in the fall of 2022. Incident reports show that officers did site reconnaissance by day and night and used an Illinois State Police plane for aerial surveillance.\n\nOfficers issued 21 citations and 12 written warnings to the Cox hunting party. They alleged in reports that:\n\nDanny Cox used a firearm permit issued to his wife, Nancy, who doesn’t hunt, to harvest a doe.\n\nKamdan Cox used Nancy’s archery permit to harvest a 5-point buck.\n\nKyle Cox harvested deer using free landowner permits, despite not living on the property.\n\nOthers in the party used permits obtained in the name of Danny and Nancy Cox’s daughter, Kayleigh, who doesn’t hunt.\n\nOfficers observed trail cameras on nine deer stands or blinds baited with corn, molasses and mineral salt.\n\nDanny Cox told them that he’s a “conservationist” who feeds deer year-round to ensure they have enough to eat.\n\nDeer baiting is illegal in Illinois due to ethical or “fair-chase” standards and the risk of disease spread from congregated feeding, according to IDNR, although more than 20 states allow it.",

    "fullText": "All truckers and bus drivers will have to take their commercial driver’s license tests in English as the Trump administration expands its aggressive campaign to improve safety in the industry and get unqualified drivers off the road.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced the latest effort Friday to ensure that drivers meet the federal requirements to understand English well enough to read road signs and communicate with law enforcement officers. Florida already started administering its tests in English.\n\nCurrently, many states allow drivers to take their license tests in other languages even though they are required to demonstrate English proficiency. California offered tests in 20 other languages. Duffy said that a number of states have hired other companies to administer commercial driver's licenses tests, and those companies aren't enforcing the standards that drivers are supposed to meet to demonstrate their driving and English skills.\n\nThese latest enforcement efforts come just days after the Transportation Department said 557 driving schools should close because they failed to meet basic safety standards. The department has been aggressively going after states that handed out commercial driver’s licenses to immigrants who shouldn’t have qualified for them ever since a fatal crash in August.\n\nA truck driver who Duffy says wasn’t authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people. Other fatal crashes since then, including one in Indiana that killed four members of an Amish community earlier this month, have only heightened concerns.\n\nStates are expected to ensure drivers can speak English before giving them a commercial license, and then law enforcement is supposed to check driver's language skills during any traffic stops or inspections. Drivers who can't communicate effectively are supposed to be pulled off the road. A recent federal effort involving 8,215 inspections led to nearly 500 drivers being disqualified because of their English skills. California initially resisted enforcing the English rules, but the state recently pulled more than 600 drivers off the highways.\n\nDuffy said every American wants drivers who get behind the wheel of a big rig to be well-qualified to handle those vehicles. But he said that for too long the problems in the trucking industry were “allowed to rot and no one's paying attention to it for decades.\"\n\n“Once you start to pay attention, you see that all these bad things have been happening. And the consequence of that is that Americans get hurt,” Duffy said. “When we get on the road, we should expect that we should be safe. And that those who drive those 80,000-pound big rigs, that they are well-trained, they’re well-qualified, and they’re going to be safe.”\n\nThe campaign will also now expand to prevent fraudulent trucking companies from getting into the business while continuing to go after questionable schools and ensure states are complying with all the regulations for handing out commercial licenses.\n\nDuffy said that the registration system and requirements for trucking companies will be strengthened while Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration inspectors conduct more spot checks of trucks and commercial driver’s license schools.\n\nOfficials are also trying to make sure that the electronic logging devices drivers use are accurate, and that states are following all the regulations to ensure drivers are qualified to get commercial licenses.\n\nCurrently, companies only have to pay $300 and show proof of insurance to get registered to operate, and then they might not be audited until a year or more later. And even then the audits might be done virtually, which makes it less likely to identify fraudulent companies.\n\nThat has made it easy for fraudulent companies that are known in the industry as “chameleon carriers” to register multiple times under different names and then simply switch names and registration numbers to avoid any consequences after crashes or other violations.\n\nDan Horvath, who is the chief operating officer for the American Trucking Associations trade group, said this longstanding problem has made it far too easy for companies that have been ordered to shut down to just change their name and registration number and keep operating the same way.\n\n“What we think at ATA has happened over the years is that we have a lack of true enforcement and intervention with motor carriers that are in operation,” Horvath said. Only a small fraction of trucking companies ever undergo a full compliance review with an in-person inspection, he said.\n\nAfter that Indiana crash, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration knocked the company that employed the driver out of service and pulled the DOT numbers assigned to two other companies that were linked to AJ Partners. Tutash Express and Sam Express in the Chicago area were also disqualified, and the Aydana driving school that the trucker involved in the crash attended lost its certification.\n\nImmigration authorities arrested that driver because they said the 30-year-old from Kyrgyzstan entered the country illegally. Authorities say he pulled out and tried to go around a truck that had slowed in front of him, and his truck slammed into an oncoming van.\n\nIn December, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration took action to decertify up to 7,500 of the 16,000 schools nationwide, but that included many defunct operations.\n\nDuffy said the companies involved in that Indiana crash were all registered at the same apartment. In other cases, there might be hundreds of these chameleon companies registered at a single address.",

    "fullText": "In a scene that feels ripped from a procedural drama, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Scott Thomas Deiseroth, 42, was pulled off a Florida Keys highway in August 2025 after deputies say he was driving erratically on the Seven Mile Bridge with his two young sons in the truck — and body-camera footage reveals a confrontation that spiraled from a simple DUI stop into a forceful arrest and a viral controversy.\n\nDeputies from the Monroe County Sheriff’s Office were dispatched around 3:24 p.m. on August 13 after multiple calls reported a pickup weaving between lanes, crossing into oncoming traffic, and nearly causing collisions on U.S. Highway 1 near Bahia Honda.\n\nWhen deputies caught up to the truck near Mile Marker 36.5, they immediately noticed a strong smell of alcohol and two children, ages 7 and 9, in the back seat.\n\nThe encounter was already tense from the first words captured on bodycam. Deiseroth identified himself as an ICE agent based in Miami, insisting he was trying to get home with his boys and that his federal status mattered in how the deputies should treat him. When asked for his Department of Homeland Security credentials, he didn’t have them on hand.\n\nThings escalated when deputies asked him to perform standardized field sobriety exercises. In the footage, Deiseroth repeatedly challenges the stop, asking “Are you Haitian?” about one of the deputies — a moment that has since become the focal point of national attention on race, privilege, and bias.\n\nDeputies insist that nationality has no bearing on the stop being conducted, but Deiseroth presses the question several times, appearing to imply that the deputy’s background should influence how the situation is handled.\n\nThe video shows Deiseroth struggling with basic coordination tasks like walking in a straight line and reciting numbers. At one point he flails and stumbles, prompting deputies to question how much he has been drinking.\n\nHe claims “about four drinks,” but cannot clearly describe what he drank, and his speech and motor skills appear impaired.\n\nWhen deputies move to place him under arrest for DUI and child endangerment — a charge bolstered by the presence of his children in the vehicle — Deiseroth resists, at times refusing to step toward the patrol car and shouting at them.\n\nHe expresses fear of losing custody of his kids, saying he is in the middle of a divorce, and continues to rail against the officers even while being handcuffed.\n\nAfter the arrest, his children were handed over to their mother, and the Florida Department of Children and Families was notified, as required in cases involving potential child endangerment. Deiseroth was booked into the Monroe County Jail on misdemeanor charges of driving under the influence and resisting without violence.\n\nThe case drew national headlines not just for the surreal body-cam footage, but for the questions it raised about accountability and privilege when a federal law enforcement officer becomes the suspect.\n\nA spokesperson for ICE reportedly said that all employees are held to the agency’s highest standards, and that the matter would be addressed appropriately after investigation. At the time the footage was released, Deiseroth remained on administrative leave pending the outcome of that review.\n\nIn late 2025, Deiseroth pleaded no contest to the DUI charge. On October 30, he was sentenced to one year of probation and had his driver’s license revoked for the same period.\n\nProsecutors declined to pursue child neglect and resisting arrest charges. That decision elicited sharp criticism from some legal observers and social commentators. But that’s not all.\n\nMeanwhile, the body-cam clip continues to circulate widely, igniting debate about how law enforcement is held to account and becoming another chapter in broader discussions about ICE conduct, racial profiling, and public trust in policing agencies.\n\nEditorial Note: Video playback may be limited or restricted on certain platforms.

    "fullText": "The Gender Liberation Movement’s Raquel Willis says trans youth “are our future” and that new HHS rules amount to a national ban on gender-affirming care for young people.\n\nRather than do something, anything, about the abysmal state of healthcare in the United States, the Trump administration’s Department of Health and Human Services has doubled down on its attacks against trans youth, their families, and the web of providers who work to ensure young people can live comfortably and fully in their truths. Of course it’s not just HHS. Last summer, the conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court ruled that it isn’t discriminatory to discriminate against trans youth. But HHS has the ability to take that bigoted opinion even further by barring institutions from providing gender-affirming care as a condition of their participation in Medicare and Medicaid. The same condition would apply to Children’s Health Insurance Program funding. In other words, these proposed rules would affect nearly all, if not all, hospitals.\n\nYet there hasn’t been much coverage about them. In this dizzying era of “flood the zone” tactics, our basic freedoms are pitted against one another. We deserve more, and young people certainly deserve better.\n\nLed by the Gender Liberation Movement, 50 parents and activists, including members of ACT UP NY and ACT UP Pittsburgh, protested outside of Health and Human Services headquarters on Tuesday, on the final day of the public comment period of the rules, to make it known that “trans youth are no debate.” Organizers held a sign that read, “HANDS OFF OUR ’MONES,” while blockading the entrance of HHS, before 25 people were taken into custody, first by Department of Homeland Security agents before being handed over to the Metropolitan Police Department. The parents and activists were held for 12 hours, and some were denied food and phone calls or experienced mistreatment because of their race or gender identity, Raquel Willis, cofounder of the Gender Liberation Movement, told The Nation. The group, which organized the inaugural Gender Liberation March in 2024, works “to build power for gender liberation in culture, organizing, and policy.”\n\nIn an email interview, Willis, who was one of the organizers at the protest who was arrested, discussed why this fight over gender-affirming care is a fight for the future and what people can do to champion trans youth.\n\nRegina Mahone: Why was it important to Gender Liberation Movement to block the entrance to the HHS building?\n\nRaquel Willis: This is a critical time in the fight against tyranny and fascism, and it was necessary for us to express our public comment to Trump, RFK Jr, and their HHS that we won’t allow these cuts to care to go unopposed. With so many fights happening at once, the attacks on trans youth, their families, and affirming, qualified service providers are largely being ignored. We saw this last summer when the Supreme Court effectively greenlit state bans on gender-affirming care with its ruling in US v. Skrmetti—and there was minimal media and movement response.\n\nWe hope that, sooner rather than later, our movement will wake up and bring back some of that energy it had during marriage equality to fight for the next generation of trans, nonbinary, queer, and intersex youth. We owe it to them.\n\nRM: Can you talk about the experiences of the protesters, yourself included, who were then held in custody for some 12 hours?\n\nRW: Over those 12 hours, the arrested protesters were held in custody of the Department of Homeland Security and the Metropolitan Police Department. We spent hours having our paperwork and processing delayed by inept officers from the former agency without clarity on when we would be released or with what we would be officially charged.\n\nSome protesters were denied food and calls to their emergency contacts and legal advisers. A few of us experienced discriminatory practices like what seemed like racial profiling due to darker skin. Additionally, some transgender and nonbinary protesters were misgendered, denied housing based on their actual gender even when their ID documents aligned, and forced into solitary confinement.\n\nRM: People don’t often consider the right to protest as an issue of bodily autonomy, but the fact of these arrests and the experiences you described while in custody make that undeniable. This administration has proven it will use force not only over how we are living in our bodies but also how we defend our rights to agency and autonomy. Why was it important to you to put your body on the line, once again, particularly in this era of ramped up state violence?\n\nRW: Just as our ancestors and elders in liberation movements before us fought for dignity and full lives, the Gender Liberation Movement believes we must do the same now. Since the start of this current Trump era, we have leaned into radical defiance, understanding that we can’t simply comply, otherwise there will be no stopping at the rights that are pried out of our hands. As well, young people are so thoroughly spoken over in our society and we wanted to send a message that we see them and we are committed to protecting and defending them. So much of this care that is being stolen from trans youth is still accessible to cisgender youth, and that is utterly immoral.\n\nRM: You’ve spoken and written about how “our liberation is bound together.” Can you talk more about how this issue of trans care isn’t solely an issue for trans youth and their families but an issue that affects all of us?\n\nRW: For too long the narrative has been that trans people are isolated and alone, but the truth is we have always had vibrant, loving communities and families around us. Trans youth give us the clearest example of this. When their care is cut off, whole entire families are disturbed, as well as the network of adults from providers to educators who affirm them.\n\nWe know that the current administration’s actions to cut off care for trans youth won’t stop there. The ages on the bans keep creeping up and it won’t be long until we see more cuts for access to care for trans adults as well. This administration wants to take more and more away from people on the margins, whether you’re trying to afford insulin or mental health medications or simply rely on Medicaid and Medicare to live the full, healthy life you deserve.\n\nRM: How can people help to minimize the harm being done right now and be a shield for trans youth in their communities who would be harmed by these rules seeking to eliminate most trans youth care in the country?\n\nRW: We must continue to raise our voices against these attacks and all anti-trans legislation. We must urge progressive and empathetic lawmakers to champion trans youth, the adults who love and support them, and all of our rights. We must educate our neighbors on why voting for these measures would be against their own interest. We must pour resources into and donate to organizations who are supporting groups on the frontlines from Gender Liberation Movement to our friends with the Trans Youth Emergency Project and Elevated Access. We must, above all, continue to build a culture that affirms and supports trans youth and their truths. They are our future and we better start acting like it.",

    "fullText": "MILAN — Polish skater Kamila Sellier suffered a serious injury in the sixth quarterfinal of Friday night’s 1500m short-track speedskate and was taken from Assago Ice Skating Arena to a nearby hospital. Polish officials indicated that she was in good spirits, even raising a thumbs-up as she left the arena.\n\nLate in the quarterfinal, Sellier appeared to lose her footing and slipped, colliding with the United States’ Kristen Santos-Griswold. In the ensuing accident, Santos-Griswold’s skate caught Sellier on the face. Sellier slid into the protective retaining wall, and medical crews raised a sheet around her to protect the scene from the audience. She was stretchered from the ice.\n\nMasakra ....\nFatalnie wyglądał wypadek Kamili Sellier podczas rywalizacji w short tracku na igrzyskach olimpijskich.

Other reports indicated that Sellier had potentially fractured a cheekbone and suffered severe swelling.\n\n“We are waiting for what the hospital tests will show,” Niedźwiedzki said, via translation.\n\nOne of Sellier’s teammates, Natalia Maliszewska, appeared visibly shaken as she spoke with reporters. “My thoughts are with her,” Maliszewska said in Polish. “I can’t think of anything else.”\n\n“These aren't common accidents, but they do happen,” Sellier’s teammate Gabriela Topolska said in Polish. “Kamila already has one of them, from a skate on her face. Kamila has a cut in her skin, with stitches.”\n\nSellier has won several European speed-skating medals, most recently a silver medal in the 2000m mixed relay at the European short track speed skating championships in January.\n\nSantos-Griswold was disqualified from the race, potentially because of an illegal pass that led to the accident. She declined to speak to media after the race, which continued after the injury timeout.",

Mitch McConnell and former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy.\n\nIn the call, McConnell and McCarthy allegedly discussed bringing back slavery, creating state-funded religious schools, banning abortion, stemming immigration and the forced impregnation of eighth-graders.\n\nWe found no credible evidence that the transcript was authentic or that any such conversation between McConnell and McCarthy ever took place. The claim is unfounded.\n\nIn February 2026, social media users wrote to Snopes on Instagram, asking about videos of internet users listening to an audio clip (archived) of an alleged transcript of a phone call between Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. The transcript was supposedly a record of the two men discussing measures to ban abortion, stem immigration, create state-funded religious schools, bring back slavery and impregnate eighth graders.\n\nOne of the Instagram users who posted a video of themselves listening to the transcript wrote in text superimposed over the clip, \"Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy talk about bringing slavery back & and making it mandatory for 8th graders to get pregnant in order to graduate.\"\n\nThe claim also circulated on X (archived), Facebook (archived), Bluesky (archived) and Reddit (archived).\n\nWe found no evidence whatsoever that the audio clip or transcript represented an authentic conversation between McConnell and McCarthy.\n\nWe found no reputable news sources reporting the \"leaked\" transcript (archived, archived, archived, archived), which would have been extremely newsworthy if true. Though McConnell and McCarthy both previously voted against federal protections for abortion, a common opinion for their party, neither had publicly expressed opinions or plans that aligned with the other supposed policy points like slavery and state-funded religious education allegedly discussed on the call.\n\nWe reached out to representatives for McConnell and McCarthy to ask if the transcript read out in the videos was genuine and await replies to our queries.\n\nThe full transcript of the alleged phone call, which an unidentified voice read out, was as follows:\n\nMitch: We have to bring slavery back. Those were the good old days.\n\nKevin: How will we do that, there's no way we can do that.\n\nMitch: Black people won't do it but white people will.\n\nKevin: How will we get white people to be slaves? That sounds ridiculous.\n\nMitch: We have to get rid of the separation of church and state. We must have state-funded religious schools.\n\nKevin: I don't see where you're getting at.\n\nMitch: Those schools will have work programs for fourth through eighth graders.\n\nKevin: Ah, I think I see where you're going here. How is that going to work?\n\nMitch: We get the kids to be — to pick all the produce as a part of their work program to teach them the values of good, old-fashioned blue-collar labor and the bounty of God.\n\nKevin: I don't think that anyone will go for that.\n\nMitch: It's all about grooming, start in the first grade and by fourth grade they'll be ready to do it.\n\nKevin: But we already have people to pick the produce.\n\nMitch: We have to finish the wall.\n\nKevin: No way that's going to happen.\n\nMitch: We find better ways to get the immigrants out of the United States.\n\nKevin: This will be too busy, too hard and we'll be too busy trying to sustain this over long periods of time and generations.\n\nMitch: No, we get rid of the abortion laws in the United States and we make it mandatory that all eighth-grade females be impregnated in order to graduate.\n\nKevin: Oh, like replacing the crops. Ha ha ha. Pun intended.\n\nAlso Kevin: I will work on getting the abortion ban, you work on state-funded religious schools.\n\nMitch: We don't have to do either. Lindsey and I took care of that with the new SCOTUS.\n\n\"Lindsey\" was an apparent reference to Lindsey Graham, the senior senator from South Carolina and a fellow Republican. \"SCOTUS\" is a common abbreviation for the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nThe versions of the alleged phone call shared online were scant on details about when the conversation supposedly took place. Some said the recording was from July 2022, but did not back up this claim. Online postings contained no further information about who leaked the alleged call or why.\n\nAs stated above, Snopes found no evidence that the alleged call between McConnell and McCarthy was real, nor did the call seem to reflect the politicians' publicly expressed opinions.\n\nMcConnell and McCarthy both voted against the Women's Health Protection Act, which would \"prohibit governmental restrictions on the provision of and access to abortion services.\" The bill passed the House in 2021 but failed in the Senate in 2022.\n\nSince then, McConnell has said that abortion should be dealt with at a state rather than a federal level. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a nonprofit that seeks to reduce and ultimately end abortion in the U.S., rated both McConnell and McCarthy \"A+.\"\n\nBoth McConnell and McCarthy have historically opposed slavery, a central theme of the alleged call, on their social media accounts. McCarthy spoke (archived) of the \"evils\" of slavery in 2019. That same year, McConnell wrote (archived) about \"slavery's stain on our history\" on X. However, McConnell did previously oppose the idea of reparations for slavery, saying in 2019 he didn't think \"reparations for something that happened 150 years ago, for whom none of us currently living are responsible, is a good idea.\"\n\nLastly, McConnell allegedly advocated for \"state funded religious schools\" in the phone call transcript. These schools, he allegedly argued, would be the basis for the renewed slavery project, as students would participate in work programs. In reality, McConnell has historically been a strong advocate for school choice, co-authoring an opinion piece in 2013 that argued \"Choice breeds competition — which is the best way to improve schools,\" an opinion that would seemingly be at odds with advocating for forced attendance at state-funded schools.\n\nThis was not the first rumor Snopes has investigated about either McConnell or McCarthy. For example, we previously looked into claims that McConnell said he would not participate in 2020 election debates that included female moderators and that a photo authentically showed McCarthy watching himself lose a vote for speaker of the House.\n\nBlad, Evie. \"Senate GOP Sticks to School Choice Push in Slimmed Down Relief Proposal.\" Education Week, 8 Sep. 2020. www.edweek.org, https://www.edweek.org/education/senate-gop-sticks-to-school-choice-push-in-slimmed-down-relief-proposal/2020/09.\n\nChu, Judy. \"H.R.3755 - Women's Health Protection Act of 2021.\" Congress.Gov, 6 Aug. 2021, https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3755.\n\nHuffington Post: Op-Ed by Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, Sens.
