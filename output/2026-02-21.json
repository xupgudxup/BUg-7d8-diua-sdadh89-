    "fullText": "Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid has offered a fresh update on Travis Kelce’s future, stressing that open dialogue remains the most important factor as speculation continues.\n\nThe veteran tight end has faced renewed questions about how much longer he plans to play, particularly after another demanding postseason run.\n\nReid’s latest comments suggest the situation is stable rather than urgent.\n\nPer ESPN, Reid said, “There is communication. That’s the main thing. I’ve said this before: As long as there’s communication, I’m good.\n\n“That means people want to move forward. I think that’s where Travis is.”\n\nThe Chiefs have leaned heavily on Kelce throughout their recent Super Bowl runs, with the tight end remaining Patrick Mahomes’ most trusted target in critical moments.\n\nAt 36, Kelce continues to produce at a high level, but the physical demands of the position inevitably prompt discussion about longevity.\n\nReid’s emphasis on communication indicates there is no disconnect between player and organisation. Instead, both sides appear aligned in assessing what comes next.\n\nReid added: “I’m not trying to put words in his mouth at all, and I try to give him some space here. He’s been doing this a long time, and he can sort all that out as he goes forward.\n\n“But we’re proceeding with that.”\n\nThe head coach’s tone reflects respect for a player who has become central to the franchise’s modern era.\n\nKelce’s resume includes multiple Super Bowl titles and consistent Pro Bowl selections, placing him among the most accomplished tight ends in NFL history.\n\nFor now, the message from Kansas City is clear: discussions are ongoing, and the relationship remains strong.\n\nPatrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce facing lawsuit over their Kansas City steakhouse\n\n‘Shut up’ – Chris Jones fires back after ESPN analyst says Chiefs should move on from Travis Kelce\n\nWhat ‘difficult’ Travis Kelce decision should Kansas City Chiefs make, reveals ESPN insider",

    "title": "Early pecking order and Verstappen’s concerns: 7 key takeaways from F1 testing",
    "description": "After three weeks in Barcelona and Bahrain, F1 heads to Melbourne. But what are the main lessons from pre-season testing? From Mercedes’ favourite status to interesting tech solutions, here are the key takeaways",
    "fullText": "Prior to winter testing, George Russell was already the bookmakers’ top favourite for the 2026 Formula 1 world title, and that picture has not changed after three weeks of running.\n\nYes, Ferrari ultimately topped the timesheets, but that says little. Traditionally, the Scuderia tends to show a bit more than some of its rivals and Charles Leclerc even bolted on a set of C4 tyres, a softer compound than Pirelli normally brings to Bahrain. Mercedes did not feel that necessity, which in itself may be a sign of confidence.\n\nF1 Bahrain pre-season test: Ferrari tops testing overall by 0.8s\n\nAs McLaren team boss Andrea Stella explained on Friday evening: individual lap times say little, only the long runs reveal a first indication. In that respect, Mercedes has made a good impression at various moments. Moreover, rivals – not least Max Verstappen – have expressed the view that Toto Wolff’s outfit is still holding quite a bit of performance in reserve. In that regard, it was telling that Pirelli has indicated that the lap times in Bahrain (in contrast to those in Barcelona) were slower than anticipated, which may also point to sandbagging.\n\nMercedes remains the favourite after the first on-track action of the year, but that does not take away from the fact that Ferrari has started well. The long runs looked relatively consistent, also in terms of energy deployment over multiple laps. There is cautious reason for optimism in Maranello, although it is not something that should make anyone in Brackley or Brixworth nervous.\n\nWhen Stella shared his own view on the early pecking order, the message was clear: Mercedes and Ferrari are a step ahead, behind them McLaren and Red Bull seem relatively close to each other – with Oscar Piastri slightly quicker than Verstappen in Thursday’s long runs.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that not all Mercedes customer teams seemed to have used the exact same mappings as the factory team in Bahrain – an aspect Alpine alluded to. Perhaps there is still a bit more to come for the likes of McLaren in that regard.\n\nThis, however, does nothing to diminish the good impression Red Bull has made with its own power unit. Wolff described the DM01 as “the benchmark”, although that praise seemed rather politically charged. Moreover, technical director Pierre Wache explained that Red Bull had mastered certain aspects of the energy management slightly earlier than its competitors, but he was quick to add that the rest of the pack had since taken steps in the same direction.\n\nIt may not make Red Bull Powertrains the absolute benchmark, contrary to what Wolff said, but it remains impressive how that project has come out of the blocks. The power unit has proven reliable so far and Red Bull looks competitive. As Mekies rightly pointed out on Friday evening: that in itself is already quite an achievement for a newcomer.\n\nBased on early evidence, the four top teams from last year still appear to be the four top teams in 2026. With changes to both the engine and chassis regulations, in theory, the door was open for a major surprise, but a fairytale à la Brawn GP in 2009 has not materialised.\n\nSeveral factors underlie this. The most important one is that the big four still have the most potential. Yes, the budget cap is meant to ensure a level playing field, but structurally the larger outfits still retain some crucial advantages. That applies both in terms of facilities and personnel, although there is one team on the grid that should theoretically be able to match that – but more on that below.\n\nTeam by team: How Bahrain's double pre-season test went for the F1 2026 field\n\nAs for the ‘best of the rest’ position, Alpine and Haas seem to hold good cards for now. Alpine had virtually written off 2025 to perform better this season and that approach appears to be paying off, at least in the early days. The Mercedes power unit naturally helps, although team members acknowledge that its integration and adjusting the working methods after years of being a factory team will take some time. Still, Alpine seems back in a position to fight for something – and that is already an important step forward compared to last season.\n\nThe biggest loser of pre-season testing is easy to guess: Aston Martin. That message was already audible during its season launch in Saudi Arabia. From all corners at the home of title sponsor Aramco came the same line: “It’s not about where we stand in Melbourne, it’s all about our development and the second half of the season.” In Bahrain it became clear why that message was being emphasised so strongly: the team has work to do, a lot of it in fact.\n\nAn important part of that seems related to Honda. The F1 project of the Japanese brand now looks very different compared to the successful years with Red Bull. After the decision to officially quit F1 at the end of 2021, many people left or were reallocated to other R&D divisions within the company. Honda therefore largely had to rebuild the project from scratch. Add to that the integration with a new partner, and the fact that Aston Martin is now running its own gearbox for the first time, and the complexity of the whole project becomes clear.\n\nHonda ‘unhappy’ with its own F1 performance, not just reliability\n\nIn that respect it did not help that Adrian Newey, by his own admission, was only able to start late, and that the new wind tunnel with its 2026 car became operational four months later than planned. As the integration of the engine into the chassis was considered a key advantage of this partnership, that delay is now being felt in other areas. With Newey, Honda and the hyper-modern Silverstone campus, all the ingredients for long-term success appear to be in place, but if pre-season testing has made one thing clear, it is that this project will take time – perhaps a lot of time. The follow-up question is whether Fernando Alonso still has that time behind the wheel.\n\nA fear that technical directors usually express ahead of a regulation change is that the new rules might be too restrictive. This time it was said by, among others, Newey. But in practice this ruleset seems to offer enough room for distinctive designs. In pre-season, the creation of Newey himself stood out, not least because of the rather extreme suspension choices at the rear.\n\nDuring testing in Bahrain a few more interesting solutions emerged. Audi came up with completely new sidepods – a concept that differed from what the other teams had shown up to that point – and Ferrari drew attention with a rotating rear wing. Team boss Frederic Vasseur emphasised that it was a test item and that it has to be analysed whether it will be raced in Melbourne, although the FIA has confirmed that it is legal and usable if Ferrari wishes to run it.\n\nSuch creative interpretations are still possible in 2026, and that in itself is good news. It not only fits the innovative nature of the pinnacle of motorsport, but also underlines the continuous arms race between all teams. Under a new set of regulations that applies more than ever, which means this has only been the first glimpse of what will be an extreme development rate – in Australia and beyond, the pace of teams introducing new parts will remain relentless.\n\nWhile that aspect – the development race – is still “peak F1”, that does not apply, according to all drivers, to the experience behind the wheel. Verstappen voiced his objections first and in the most outspoken way. The Dutchman called F1’s new era “Formula E on steroids” and added that he did not even want to test the 2026 car in the simulator last year, simply because it felt so bad.\n\nMax Verstappen on F1 2026 flaws: ‘I already said that in 2023, but nobody listened’\n\nAlthough the overall picture cannot easily be remedied and is linked to how these regulations came about (politically) – first finalising the engine rules for Audi and Honda and only then looking at the chassis and aerodynamics – it is clear that teams are learning quickly. In terms of energy management and avoiding unnatural things, such as lifting and extra downshifting, it already looks slightly better than in Barcelona, although the real challenges are still to come.\n\nThose challenges will confront teams in Melbourne. Energy harvesting will be a much greater challenge there, as Stella explained, which may require more ‘unnatural things’ from drivers. A potential workaround could be running 300kW electric power in race trim rather than 350kW and relying on ‘super clipping’ (charging to 350kW instead of 250kW while flat-out), although the FIA wants to monitor the early races before taking any action. Until then, the hope will be that the image does not become too alienating for diehard fans. Despite teams having learned a lot, drivers’ concerns have not disappeared – certainly not for some of the tracks that are to come.\n\nThe final point is not directly related to the on-track action, but after the past few months it cannot be omitted: the political discussion about the compression ratio. While the pure racing may not be “peak F1”, the political chess game certainly is. It is alive like never before, with the Mercedes engine dominating the discussions in Bahrain.\n\nWolff has indicated that Mercedes kept the FIA “in the loop” throughout the entire development process, although the governing body nevertheless saw the need – after questions from other manufacturers – to put the compression ratio tests to a vote. If a double test is indeed introduced – one of which at a temperature of 130 degrees Celsius – that tightening will only take effect on 1 August, meaning everyone loses a little – the textbook example of an F1 compromise – and the issue will continue to simmer in the background for a while.\n\nNikolas Tombazis said on behalf of the FIA that the performance advantage is much smaller than some in the paddock suspect and that, in his view, the topic does not deserve that much attention at all. But that too is typical F1; every grey area and every potential performance differentiator – no matter how small – is fiercely contested. During the testing days in Barcelona and Bahrain many things in F1 turned out to be different, but this aspect certainly did not.\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

Unfortunately for the Dubs, they won’t have a chance to land veteran point guard Mike Conley this season.\n\n“The Minnesota Timberwolves have signed Mike Conley to a deal for the rest of the season,” HoopsHype’s Michael Scotto reported Tuesday. “Conley has averaged 9.2 points, including shooting 41.3% from three-point range, 4.7 assists, and 1.0 steals per game in four combined seasons with Minnesota.”\n\nConley landed on the buyout market after the Charlotte Hornets, who traded for the former All-Star on Feb. 3, waived him two days later.\n\nAlthough Conley isn’t the dynamic point guard he was in his younger days, he still boasts a positive reputation in the big leagues. Why? Because the Ohio State product is a likable role player who understands that, despite his advanced age, he can still be an impactful veteran presence.\n\nConley, who’s averaging 4.4 points and 2.9 assists per game while shooting 32.2% from the field and 32.1% from three with the Timberwolves this season, could have been an older yet beneficial addition to Golden State in late February.\n\nSimply put, it just wasn’t meant to be for Stephen Curry and the Dubs.\n\nMore NBA: Lakers cut ties with Luka Doncic's 7-foot ex-Mavericks teammate via G-League buyout",

    "fullText": "The \"Boca World\" has a new protagonist. Adam Bareiro was officially presented as the club's new signing after sealing a deal that will tie him to the institution for the next three seasons. The 29-year-old Paraguayan forward returns to Argentine football after his stint with Fortaleza in Brazil, thus fulfilling a long-held wish of Juan Román Riquelme, who always had him as a top priority on his radar.\n\nThe transfer was closed for a figure close to 3 million dollars. A significant detail of the operation is that half of that amount went to River Plate, a club that still owned 50% of his rights. In fact, his \"millonario\" past sparked the first tense moment of the day: while heading to his medical examination, a River fan confronted him, shouting \"traitor.\" Bareiro, far from getting into controversy, simply smiled and continued with the signing protocol.\n\nAfter passing his medical exams and signing a three-year contract (with an option for one more), the striker immediately moved to La Bombonera. There, he was seen in one of the boxes watching the match against Racing, already immersed in the atmosphere of his new home. With this move, Boca adds hierarchy and attacking power to face the challenges of 2026, backed by the absolute confidence of the management in his goal-scoring ability.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

Both Hurston Waldrep and Spencer Schwellenbach are expected to miss much of the 2026 season due to surgeries on their pitching elbows.\n\nWhile the Braves still have solid pitching depth, they’ve been looking at the free agent market for potential options to fill Waldrep and Schwellenback’s spots in the rotation. One player that has been linked to Atlanta is one-time All-Star Lucas Giolito.\n\nThe 31-year-old had a good season for the Boston Red Sox in 2025 after missing all of 2024 following Tommy John surgery. Yet, for some reason, he remains a free agent with spring training a week old for teams around the league.\n\nWell, his 2025 teammate Garret Crochet believes that should end, and claimed this week that the Braves are a “pretty obvious” place he should land.\n\n“It just doesn’t make a ton of sense. It’s just been that way for a while, though,” Crochet told the media on Saturday when asked about Giolito still being available. “The middle of the market on both the position player and pitching side kind of gets screwed and ends up either signing after the season begins or what have you.”\n\n“… A lot of guys never figure it out here. The guys that have, they’ve stayed around, in the past, for a reason. I don’t think that just because we’re getting super analytical, we should look at it any differently,” he added. “When you look at depth, you’re looking at guys who are experienced and have done it, not guys who can do it. That’s not depth. That’s just another prospect.”\n\nGiolito went 10-4 with a 3.41 ERA and fanned 121 batters in 145 innings last season.\n\nBlue Jays & Max Scherzer Getting ‘Serious’ in Talks\n\nReport Reveals Juan Soto Delivered Record Revenue for NY Mets in Debut Season\n\nBest MLB Shortstops 2026: 10 Best Shortstops in MLB Right Now",

    "description": "Jamie George and Marcus Smith were thrown on in the first half for Luke Cowan-Dickie and Freddie Steward but England still fell to a chastening 42-21 loss on home soil",
    "fullText": "Steve Borthwick explained the thinking behind his early substitutions during England’s humiliating home Six Nations defeat to Ireland.\n\nEngland were blown away by Andy Farrell’s side at Allianz Stadium, trailing 22-0 in the first half and ultimately falling to a 42-21 loss – Ireland’s biggest away win over their old enemy, as well as the most points they’ve scored at Twickenham – as huge questions over the direction of Borthwick’s team came to a head for a second week running.\n\nTo try and stem the tide, Borthwick made three substitutions in the first half, although one of those was injury-enforced as stricken scrum half Alex Mitchell was replaced by Jack van Poortvliet on 23 minutes, Jamie George came on at hooker for Luke Cowan-Dickie in the 29th minute and Marcus Smith replaced Freddie Steward at full back in the 39th minute.\n\nEngland were 10-0 down when Mitchell departed, trailed 15-0 by the time George entered the fray and the score was 22-0 when Smith was thrown on just before the break.\n\nExplaining his decision to remove Cowan-Dickie, who had erred on two early lineouts, and turn to former skipper George before the half-hour mark, Borthwick cited the veteran’s leadership.\n\n“We’ve got a really good group of players and unfortunately the context of the game and context is always key, you can start talking about minutes of changes but the context is the key element to it,” said Borthwick.\n\n“So what did we face there? Down on the scoreboard we’d had two lineouts very early in the game go not the way we wanted them to. Jamie George certainly helps in that regard. I thought Jamie George’s experience supporting Maro there was important as well.”\n\nGeorge’s presence didn’t stop Tommy O’Brien going over for Ireland’s third try less than a minute after the hooker came on, meaning the deficit was 22 points by the time the explosive Smith was preferred to Steward on 39 minutes.\n\n“Late in the first half clearly Marcus Smith... I think you all know how highly I rate Freddie Stewart,” added Borthwick. “I think Marcus Smith has a different skillset and clearly when you are points down on the scoreboard, you need to score.\n\n“That’s where someone like Marcus Smith can add a different element to it.”\n\nRemoving starting scrum half Mitchell earlier in the game was enforced and a real blow to England, with Borthwick confirming that the prognosis may not be good.\n\n“It looks like he’s a soft tissue injury,” explained Borthwick. “We don’t know how bad .”\n\nAnother player who struggled for England at Allianz Stadium was George Ford, with the fly half uncharacteristically missing touch from two separate penalties and struggling to get England’s attack clicking in the Irish 22.\n\nThere will be renewed calls for Fin Smith to wear the No 10 jersey for England’s next game against Italy in Rome, after the upcoming fallow week, but Borthwick refused to be drawn on whether he would make that change.\n\n“I think George has done so much good for England for such a long period of time and particularly over the last spell,” said the head coach.\n\n“I thought the way George played in the autumn was outstanding and I thought two weeks ago he played really well here against Wales.\n\n“You want to talk about individuals, but it is the team – it is all of us today and it was all of us last week. We didn’t find a way to get the result we wanted and that’s all of our responsibility.”\n\nWhen pushed on Fin Smith’s qualities in particular, Borthwick added: “I think Fin is an excellent player as is Marcus Smith and we have some very good players and options in that position [fly half] and the 15 position also.”",

    "fullText": "The Orioles’ Grapefruit League opener yesterday was a resounding success, at least if you’re a pitcher or Pete Alonso. The Birds’ newest slugger mashed a two-run homer in his O’s spring debut to provide all the offense in a 2-0 win over the Yankees. Trevor Rogers, Keegan Akin, Rico Garcia, Grant Wolfram, Jose Espada, and Trey Gibson combined on a three-hit shutout, with Gibson pitching the final three innings for the save. All of those guys except Gibson are either locks or strong candidates for the Opening Day roster, so it’s nice to see them all start well.\n\nThe O’s have a return engagement at Ed Smith Stadium today against the Pirates. Dean Kremer, who will soon be leaving the Orioles to pitch for Team Israel in the World Baseball Classic, takes the mound today. It’s strange to think that Kremer might have to compete for a rotation spot, but that may be the case, as he, Chris Bassitt, and Zach Eflin (if healthy) are three candidates for two openings behind Rogers, Kyle Bradish, and Shane Baz.\n\nToday’s game marks the Orioles debuts for Taylor Ward and Blaze Alexander, while Dylan Beavers and Ryan Mountcastle will also be starting for the first time this spring. Adley Rutschman and Gunnar Henderson, the latter of whom will soon leave for the WBC as well, are the only Orioles from yesterday’s game who are starting again today. They’ll take on Pirates prospect Wilber Dotel. Former Orioles Ryan O’Hearn and Billy Cook are in the Pirates’ lineup this afternoon.\n\nThe game will be televised on MASN and on radio on 98 Rock.\n\nLF Taylor Ward\nC Adley Rutschman\n1B Ryan Mountcastle\n2B Blaze Alexander\nDH Gunnar Henderson\nRF Dylan Beavers\nCF Leody Taveras\n3B Weston Wilson\nSS Luis Vázquez",

    "fullText": "TESERO, Italy (AP) — Norway’s Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo set the new gold standard Saturday for the most wins by one athlete in a single Winter Olympics by sweeping all six men's cross-country skiing events at the Milan Cortina Games.\n\nHis half-dozen golds helped catapult Norway to new heights in first-place finishes and total Winter Games medals.\n\nKlaebo has plenty of company atop the podium. The nation has won big on cross-country skis — in classic and freestyle races and Nordic combined in Tesero, and biathlon in Anterselva.\n\nIt also has notable wins in ski jumping, freestyle skiing, Alpine skiing and speedskating.\n\nThe latest records build on Norway’s dominance in the Winter Games: It has more winter medals than any other country and has led the medal count in the past three Olympics.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of some of the key numbers that explain why Norway has been so dominant.\n\nSix of Norway's 18 gold medals through Saturday afternoon were won by Klaebo, though two were for relays involving teammates.\n\nSki jumper Anna Odine Stroem won both the normal and large hills competitions, becoming the first woman to do so because it was the first year women jumped on the bigger hill. Stroem also won a silver in the mixed team event.\n\nNorway won a pair of golds in men’s freestyle skiing. Birk Ruud won freeski slopestyle and Tormod Frostad won men’s freeski big air.\n\nIn alpine skiing, Thea Louise Stjernesund won silver in women’s giant slalom and Henrik Kristoffersen got the bronze in the men’s slalom.\n\nJens Luraas Oftebro stood atop the podium in all three competitions in Nordic combined, the sport that begins with a ski jump and ends with a cross-country ski race. Oftebro won individually on the normal and large hills and again in the team relay.\n\nMen's speedskater Sander Eitrem won gold in the men’s 5000 meter race.\n\nOn the women's side, Ragne Wiklund hauled in three medals: silvers in the 1500 meters and 3000 meters and bronze in the 5000 meters.\n\nKlaebo’s victory in the 50-kilometer mass start race Saturday shattered the nearly 50-year record set by American speedskater Eric Heiden, who won five golds in the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics.\n\nAll of Heiden’s wins were in individual races and two of Klaebo’s have come in team events, so Heiden’s record for individual wins still stands.\n\nThe biathlon team won 11 medals, led by Maren Kirkeeide, who won individual gold in the women’s 7.5-kilometer sprint and silver in the 10-kilometer pursuit and was part of the bronze medal-winning four by 6-kilometer relay. On the men's side, Johan‑Olav Botn won gold in the individual 20-kilometer and Johannes Dale‑Skjevdal won in the 15-kilometer mass start.\n\nSturla Holm Laegreid, won four individual medals, two silver and two bronze.\n\nVetle Sjaastad Christiansen won an individual silver and shared a silver in the four by 7.5-kilometer race with Laegreid and Botn.\n\nCross-country skiers captured the most medals, with Klaebo laying claim to nearly half of them — with a little help from his friends in the team relay and sprint titles.\n\nTeammates who won the four by 7.5-kilometer relay with Klaebo all enjoyed some hardware of their own.\n\nMartin Loewstrøm Nyenget won silver in the 50-kilometer mass start and bronze in the 20-kilometer skiathlon. Einar Hedegart also shared gold in the team sprint with Klaebo and won a bronze in the 10-kilometer interval start. Emil Iversen won bronze in the 50-kilometer race.\n\nNorwegian women beat dominant Sweden in the team four by 7.5-kilometer race and Heidi Weng, who was in that foursome, added an individual bronze in the 20-kilometer skiathlon\n\nNorway has won a total of 40 medals: 18 golds, 11 silvers and 11 bronze.\n\nThe gold medals beat its previous record of 16 won at the 2022 Beijing Olympics for the most won by a nation in a single Winter Olympics.\n\nThe total medal count with Norway's cross-country sweep on Saturday also set a Winter Olympics record, though the 116 medal events this year is more than in the past.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "description": "Ireland secured their biggest ever win over England at Twickenham",
    "fullText": "Ireland boss Andy Farrell hailed Stuart McCloskey’s late cover tackle on Marcus Smith as a moment that defined his side’s superb Six Nations performance against England.\n\nThe visitors secured their biggest win over England at Twickenham, stunning the hosts in a 42-21 success that kept their title hopes alive.\n\nIt was a showing that stood in stark contrast to a flat performance against France on the opening night, with much of the Irish older guard delivering after being backed by Farrell to give a better account of themselves.\n\nCentre McCloskey stood out throughout, with the 33-year-old showing an impressive turn of speed to haul in Smith with ease after the England replacement full-back had intercepted a pass near halfway.\n\nWing Robert Baloucoune later scrambled to deny Tommy Freeman a try in two moments that Farrell believes showed his side’s spirit.\n\n“I suppose the telling parts of Stu McCloskey chasing back Marcus there and being able to put him in touch just shows the fight,” Farrell explained. “And also, the Rob Baloucoune one on the far side just shows the fight and the spirit that these lads have got for one another and what it means to them.\n\n“It looked like we were hunting people down throughout the game. You know, it's one thing going up with a good start and getting the bonus point there as far as four tries is concerned, but how we kick-chased, how we kept hunting down the breakdown, all that type of stuff, it shows that that's a proper performance where there's no egos, that everyone's just going for it together and trying to gain a little bit more respect off one another.”\n\nWhile British and Irish Lions Jamison Gibson-Park and Tadhg Beirne were also among Ireland’s best, there were coming of age performances from young wings Baloucoune and Tommy O’Brien.\n\nO’Brien had been introduced for James Lowe after his Leinster teammate suffered an injury that “didn’t look too good”, according to Farrell, and combined superbly with the rest of the Irish back three to tear England apart in wider channels.\n\nWIth McCloskey, winning his 26th cap after a career largely spent on the periphery of Farrell’s first choice side, also going well, the Ireland head coach believes it was a performance that showed depth developing that some felt Ireland lacked.\n\n“The growth in the team is with the likes of Rob Baloucoune and Stu McCloskey dominating at this type of level in such a big game like that,” Farrell stressed. Cian Prendergast coming on and showing that he belongs at this level. Nick Timoney coming on and doing exactly the same. The respect that they have now got from their peers is pretty solid.”\n\nAfter the fallow week, Ireland host Wales in Dublin on Friday 6 March as they continue their Six Nations campaign.",

We must play well and win.”\n\nThe pressure seems to be getting to Juve, who collapsed after the Juan Cabal red card in Istanbul and were beaten 5-2 by Galatasaray.\n\nThat leaves them with a mountain to climb on Wednesday to turn it around in that Champions League play-off.\n\nISTANBUL, TURKEY – FEBRUARY 17: Khephren Thuram of Juventus battles for possession with Baris Alper Yilmaz of Galatasaray A.S. during the UEFA Champions League 2025/26 League Knockout Play-off First Leg match between Galatasaray A.S. and Juventus at Ali Sami Yen Spor Kompleksi on February 17, 2026 in Istanbul, Turkey.

Ahead of the game against Nottingham Forest on February 22, the Liverpool boss said: \"Jeremie will not be involved this weekend yet. We hope he will be involved next week [against West Ham United] if things go as planned.\"\n\nExpected return date: August 2026\n\nBradley hurt himself when clearing the ball into touch in the closing stages of the draw at Emirates Stadium. He was taken off on a stretcher in some distress, and the club later confirmed he requires surgery on what was described as a \"significant\" knee injury. The Northern Ireland international will miss the rest of this season after sustaining bone and ligament damage.\n\nExpected return date: Late March\n\nAlexander Isak was struggling to make an impact in his first few months at Anfield, and his woes worsened when he suffered a broken leg while scoring the opening goal in Liverpool's win over Tottenham on December 23.\n\nIsak was back doing outdoor training towards the end of February but had not yet started working with a ball. Sweden's World Cup playoff semifinal against Ukraine on March 26 could be a target for the former Newcastle man.\n\nInjury: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear\n\nExpected return date: August 2026\n\nSummer signing Leoni suffered a nightmare debut as he horrifically tore an ACL against Southampton. The Italian defender underwent immediate surgery and his campaign has already been cruelly ended.\n\nGomez, Konate, Van Dijk, Kerkez\n\nNottingham Forest vs. Liverpool | Premier League | Saturday, February 21\n\nLiverpool vs. West Ham | Premier League | Saturday, February 28\n\nWolves vs. Liverpool | Premier League | Tuesday, March 3\n\nTBD vs. Liverpool | Champions League Round of 16, 1st leg | March 10/11\n\nLiverpool vs. Tottenham | Premier League | Sunday, March 15",

    "fullText": "Scott Parker's team endured long spells without the ball but their point earned at Stamford Bridge owes to a committed defensive display and a brilliant set-piece from James Ward-Prowse.\n\nThe likes of Joe Worrall, Maxime Esteve and Bashir Humphreys all made goal-saving interventions when blocking shots from Cole Palmer and Joao Pedro.\n\nIt also left goalkeeper Martin Dubravka not as busy as he would have otherwise expected to be in west London, although he had to be alert coming for crosses into the box.\n\n\"The player showed a real resilience to go a goal down early but stay in the game,\" Parker said at Stamford Bridge. \"We grew into the first half, and are maybe frustrated we weren't able to get all three points.\"\n\nThat frustration will come after Ward-Prowse delivered two almost identical set-pieces - the first was a perfect delivery for Zian Flemming's goal but Jacob Bruun Larsen could not score from an identical chance.\n\nParker added: \"[Ward-Prowse] had real quality - he is a real set-piece specialist. When you want to deliver a ball, you know where it is going. All the set-piece coaches can do the best blocks or runs but with James it is pretty easy because you know if it is delivered on the money then you have a chance.\"\n\nOf course, Chelsea's red card helped them swing the momentum but resilience gave Burnley their foundations for the draw.\n\n\"The longer you stay in the game, the more the confidence grows,\" goalscorer Flemming added. \"The red card is a significant moment because at that moment we could really attack and put them under pressure.

    "description": "James Milner has broken the Premier League appearance record, 24 years after making his debut as a 16-year-old.",
    "fullText": "\"People joke that I only did it because he didn't do his homework,\" says former Premier League referee Jon Moss about the time he sent off James Milner.\n\nTwenty-four years after making his debut, Milner, 40, broke the record for most Premier League appearances when he started for Brighton at Brentford on Saturday.\n\nA stellar career spanning more than two decades, six top-flight clubs, 654 Premier League appearances, 61 England caps, three Premier League titles, two FA Cups and one Champions League triumph has also delivered some unexpected moments.\n\nLike the time Milner - known as 'Milly' by those close to him - was sent off by Moss, his former teacher at Westbrook Lane Primary School in Horsforth, Leeds, while playing for Liverpool against Crystal Palace in 2019.\n\n\"He said I couldn't wait to get my card out,\" laughs Moss about dismissing his former pupil after switching careers.\n\n\"People say I'm the only teacher to send off one of his pupils in a Premier League game. We can both laugh about it now.\"\n\nMilner has now overtaken Gareth Barry, who played 653 times, at the top of the all-time Premier League appearance list, some 8,504 days after making his debut for hometown club Leeds United soon after leaving school in 2002.\n\n\"I think that will be a special thing for him but he is focused on top of that on the ambitions from the club as well. He wants to be always successful like he was his whole life,\" said Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler.\n\n\"He is a driver of this winning mentality and I think it's very important to have these kind of players in the squad.\n\n\"They know how to win, they know what it needs to win, how you need to prepare a game, how you react in bad phases like on bad runs we have at the moment.\"\n\nAlan Shearer, who played with Milner at Newcastle, describes him as a model professional and a \"manager's dream\".\n\n\"You would do well if you had him in your squad because you knew exactly what you were going to get,\" adds former England captain Shearer.\n\nThis is the story about a young lad from Leeds who evolved to set standards for hard work, professionalism and longevity - and earn respect from fans all over the world.\n\nMilner was just 16 and earning £70 a week as a YTS player when he broke into the first team at Leeds, six months after taking his GCSE exams.\n\nOn 10 November 2002, his dad Peter was in the away end at Upton Park when boss Terry Venables sent the youngster on for Jason Wilcox, now director of football at Manchester United, in the final minutes of a 4-3 win against West Ham.\n\nIt was a dream come true for Milner, who had grown up supporting the club and wore shirts with the names of Tony Yeboah and Tony Dorigo on the back.\n\nSix weeks after the West Ham game, Milner - aged 16 years and 356 days - became the youngest Premier League goalscorer at that time when he scored in a 2-1 win against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light.\n\nIt was not enough to get the former Leeds season ticket-holder out of his post-match duties, however.\n\nBack then YTS players were expected to clean the dressing room after first-team games.\n\n\"Even when I was playing and scoring goals, after games I was helping the kit man pick dirty shirts off the dressing room floor,\" Milner told the High Performance podcast in 2023.\n\n\"I carried on cleaning the under-18 captain's boots. I was playing in the first team but he was still older than me.\"\n\nIt was not long, however, before Milner was sent on loan to the third tier of English football to continue his football education.\n\nSome 17-year-olds might have sulked at the prospect of swapping the glamour of the Premier League for games against Grimsby and Peterborough.\n\nMilner saw it as a chance to show what he was all about.\n\nDid Milner's record become a problem for Brighton?\n\nCan you name the players with most Premier League appearances?\n\nDuring four weeks in Wiltshire, Milner played six games and scored two goals.\n\nSam Parkin, who was at Swindon at the same time as Milner, remembers a committed and hard-working teenager eager to learn.\n\n\"James was determined, driven and focused compared to some of the other young lads we had from Premier League clubs,\" recalls Parkin.\n\n\"He made a goal for me against Brighton at the Withdean Stadium and I remember us both scoring in a win against Peterborough.\"\n\nMilner describes his time in the lower leagues as a \"bit of an eye-opener\", with Swindon's players bringing their own pasta to eat on the team bus.\n\nYet he impressed with his attitude and performances, says Parkin.\n\n\"Before James went back to Leeds I told him: 'I never want to see you back here because you've got too much quality for this level',\" he adds.\n\nMilner returned to Elland Road where he became a first-team regular alongside the likes of Mark Viduka and Alan Smith.\n\nHe 'celebrated' his 18th birthday by playing in a 4-1 FA Cup defeat by Arsenal before relegation at the end of the 2003-04 season resulted in Leeds selling players to raise money.\n\nEngland forward Smith moved to Manchester United in a deal worth £7m, goalkeeper Paul Robinson went to Tottenham for £1.5m, while Milner signed for Newcastle in a deal worth £5m.\n\nNewcastle had just finished fifth in the Premier League, Sir Bobby Robson was manager and Shearer wore the captain's armband.\n\nIt was at Newcastle, however, that Milner would go on to experience one of the lowest moments of his career.\n\nShearer remembers Milner having a desire to learn and improve.\n\n\"He had a great mentality to get better, to be patient, but also to be frustrated and angry - you get that at times during your career.\"\n\nRobson lost his job four games into the 2004-05 season and was replaced by Graeme Souness, the former Liverpool and Scotland midfielder.\n\nA year after signing for Newcastle, Milner was sent out on loan to Premier League rivals Aston Villa.\n\nSouness defended his decision at the time saying \"you won't win the league with James Milners\". The remark, for which Souness has since apologised, stung the young winger, who would go on and win three Premier League titles.\n\nYet there was more turbulence ahead.\n\nMilner had impressed on loan at Villa so much that in September 2006 they offered around £4m to sign him permanently.\n\nNewcastle accepted and Milner travelled to the West Midlands only to learn upon arrival at Villa Park that the Magpies had pulled out of the deal at the 11th hour at the end of the transfer window.\n\nMilner was bitterly frustrated.\n\nIt would be another two years before he finally sealed a permanent switch to Villa at the age of 22 after 94 top-flight appearances for Newcastle.\n\nFor two seasons he played under Martin O'Neill before another move in 2010.\n\nChelsea had just won a Premier League and FA Cup double under Carlo Ancelotti and wanted to add Milner to their squad.\n\nManchester City were also keen. The trouble was, they had not won anything significant since 1976.\n\nIn the end he opted for the challenge of reviving City's fortunes.\n\nHe left five years later having helped them win two Premier League titles, one FA Cup, one League Cup and one Community Shield.\n\nMilner proved a versatile servant for both Roberto Mancini and Manuel Pellegrini, playing in a variety of positions including a stint as a lone striker - and he was popular in the dressing room.\n\n\"We won the Premier League together in 2012 but there were times that season when things were not going well,\" recalls former City defender Micah Richards.\n\n\"He was one of the people who kept everyone going.\"\n\nRichards developed a close bond with Milner but remembers getting the blame for the parody 'Boring James Milner' social media account, which mocked the player, often focusing on ironing, tea and trivial match details.\n\n\"Everyone thought I was behind it,\" says Richards.\n\n\"Whenever a new post went up Milner would say, 'Come on, mate, you've had your fun'. I'd be going, 'I swear, Millie, it's not me!'\n\n\"I ended up messaging the guy behind it, saying, 'Who is this because Milner thinks it's me?'\n\n\"He would not disclose his name but he sent me a picture of himself and it was just some random bloke. I just told him, 'Keep it up - I love it!'\"\n\nMilner played along with the 'boring' tag and during lockdown posted a video of himself cutting his lawn with scissors.\n\nAfter 147 top-flight appearances for City, he was ready for his next challenge.\n\nNext stop...Liverpool, where he won the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup, Uefa Super Cup, Fifa Club World Cup and the Community Shield.\n\nIt was not all trophies and smiles, however, at Anfield.\n\nThere was that red card from his former teacher - and then the time he angered Klopp.\n\n\"One time at half-time he [Klopp] was sharing his thoughts and I was sharing mine,\" Milner adds on the High Performance podcast.\n\n\"I remember him smashing his hands down on the table and saying, 'Will you shut up'. But Jurgen was great, I had a great relationship with him.\"\n\nAfter Liverpool came an offer from Brighton in 2023 to prolong his top-flight career, where he continues to compete in what is his 24th Premier League season.\n\nMilner, who is eight years older than Seagulls boss Hurzeler, became the Premier League's second-oldest goalscorer behind Teddy Sheringham when he scored from the penalty spot against his former club Manchester City earlier this season.\n\nHe celebrated by recreating Diogo Jota's trademark video game controller celebration in tribute to his former Liverpool team-mate, who died in a car crash last July.\n\nMilner is wearing the No 20 shirt for Brighton, the same number Jota wore at Liverpool.\n\n\"I've not scored [in the Premier League] for six years and I was wearing his number. Obviously, I've got help from the great man,\" said an emotional Milner after the match.\n\nWhere does the player who represented England at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups rank on the list of all-time Premier League greats?\n\n\"Milner's name never really is mentioned as one of the greats, but he is, without a doubt,\" says Richards.\n\nFormer Leeds and England goalkeeper Paul Robinson, who played the night Milner made his debut at West Ham in 2002, said his former team-mate had dedicated his life to remain at the top level.\n\n\"It's everything you do, it's how you walk around at home, it's what shoes you wear, it's how you sleep, it's what pillows you sleep on, it's what you eat, it's what you put in your body,\" says Robinson.\n\n\"And for him to have evolved the way that the game's evolved as well, it's huge credit to himself as a person, not just a footballer, but as a person.\"\n\nWill Milner carry on playing when his contract expires in the summer? Having turned 40 in January, he treats every game as though it could be his last.\n\nHe still remembers a conversation with veteran Leeds goalkeeper Nigel Martyn soon after breaking into the first team 24 years ago.\n\n\"He told me, 'Enjoy it while you can because it goes so fast'. I said, 'Leave it out, Nige, I'm 16!'\n\n\"And here we are in the blink of an eye - and I'm where he was.\"\n\nThis article was originally published on 6 February 2026\n\nWho has the most Premier League appearances?\n\nMilner sent off by former PE teacher\n\nLatest Brighton news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Brighton - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Bayern Munich are once again sweating over the fitness of Alphonso Davies after the Canadian left back suffered another injury setback in Saturday’s Bundesliga win. FCB head coach Vincent Kompany sounded a tentative all-clear while he conducted his post-match interview with DAZN. Bayern board-member-for-sport Max Eberl was nevertheless more pessimistic in the mixed zone.\n\nDavies’ return from the brutal (and controversial) ACL tear he suffered last spring, understandably enough, has been a slow process. Davies officially returned to action just prior to Christmas. The 25-year-old has earned four league and one cup start in his 12 appearances for Bayern across all competitions.\n\nNot looking especially confident or quick in his Bundesliga stars, Davies was at least able to register an assist off the bench in last weekend’s away win over Bremen. Apart from that, however, the 58-times-capped Canadian international hasn’t managed to get his name on the scoresheet.\n\nDavies had to exit proceedings in the 50th minute in Saturday’s league win over Eintracht Frankfurt. Ankle trouble left him unable to continue. The only thing Kompany and Eberl appeared to be in agreement about relates to the fact that Davies will miss at least two weeks.\n\n“I don’t know if it will be two or four weeks,” Kompany told DAZN. “But my gut feeling is that it won’t take that long.”\n\n“It looks like he’ll be out for longer,” Eberl nevertheless said in the mixed zone. “It appears to be something muscular.”",

    "fullText": "When the chips are down, few managers can bank on his players to deliver more than Phil Parkinson can.\n\nHis Wrexham side went 3-2 down to automatic promotion hopefuls Ipswich Town shortly after half time at Stok Cae Ras, but remarkably scored a further three goals to win 5-3.\n\nCrucially, it was a victory - Wrexham's first at home in the league in 2026 - that lifted the Red Dragons back up to sixth in the Championship table, and one that produced five different goal scorers.\n\n\"The magnitude of the effort and the commitment the lads have given us today, if ever there is a game our supporters should be proud of their team, it was today,\" Parkinson said.\n\nLatest Wrexham news, analysis and fan views\n\nWrexham edge Ipswich in eight-goal thriller\n\nWrexham twice went ahead in what was a frenetic first half in north Wales as Kieffer Moore and Josh Windass both netted.\n\nHowever, the class within Ipswich's ranks shone through as they levelled on both occasions, firstly through Anis Mehmeti and then Ivan Azon.\n\nWhen centre-back Cedric Kipre fired beyond Arthur Okonkwo within two minutes of the restart, the 1,288-strong contingent of Ipswich fans in the away end could have been forgiven for feeling they were on course for a 16th league win of the campaign.\n\nGeorge Thomason - whose heart Parkinson described as \"immense\" - netted his first goal for the club to level the match.\n\nJust 15 minutes after Callum Doyle was, according to Parkinson, fortunate not to be \"knocked clean out\" by goalkeeper Christian Walton, the defender scored his first home goal for the club since joining from Manchester City in the summer.\n\nAnd the final word was left to Nathan Broadhead - the man who left Portman Road to re-join Wrexham for a club record fee last summer.\n\nGoal scorer Doyle spoke about being \"proud\" of his team-mates.\n\nAnd victory means the Red Dragons go into Tuesday night's contest with Portsmouth (19:45 GMT) in north Wales in the play-off places once again, the perfect reward for coming out on top in a true Championship thriller.\n\n\"We're pleased with that (returning to the top six). We've got a big game on Tuesday and I can't wait,\" added Parkinson.\n\n\"It's like I keep saying, we're just enjoying the ride.\n\n\"In this division we've played Ipswich three times now, they're a good side. They've got a great manager, a really good side.\n\n\"I think if the bookies would have put all the factors together today, Ipswich making 10 changes, the freshness of coming up, they'd have probably been favourites and we've overturned that with sheer commitment, honesty and endeavour.\"",

Interestingly enough, Houston and Arizona play each other today at 3 p.m., making today one of the best days of college basketball in recent memory and a possible Final Four preview between that and Michigan vs Duke at 6:30 p.m.\n\nLast season, three of the No. 1 seeds in the early bracket reveal remained a No. 1 seed on Selection Sunday. Going a step further, only two teams from last year’s early bracket reveal — Michigan (No. 4 to No. 5 seed) and Kansas (No. 4 to No. 7) — dropped out of the top four seeds by the time Selection Sunday rolled around.\n\nNo matter what Michigan does from here on out, it has a great shot at being among the top seeds in the NCAA Tournament. The schedule doesn’t get any easier after today — matchups at Illinois, at Iowa and vs Michigan State, along with the Big Ten Tournament, still loom — but this team has been battle tested all season long and have come out victorious much more often than not.\n\nSelection Sunday is already less than a month away. We will know the entire NCAA Tournament field soon enough, as that show on CBS will start around 6 p.m. on March 15.",

Thus, Gabriel Sara remained with the Yellow-Red team.\n\n“The Brazilian’s recent performance has been incredible. The Juventus match changed many things. Sara is now attracting interest from one of the giants of English football, Manchester United.”\n\nThe Juventus match in question showed exactly what Gabriel Sara is capable of. One goal and an assist and multiple chances created.\n\nIn the Turkish Super Lig, the 26-year-old ranks in the top percentile for expected assists and successful crosses (via fotmob).\n\nUnited could certainly do with a player of his ilk. His current market value stands at €20 million as per Transfermarkt but he is expected to cost a lot more.\n\nFeature image Ahmad Mora via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "England 21-42 Ireland: The hosts wilted as the visitors turned them over at Twickenham by a record margin",
    "fullText": "The reports of Ireland’s demise have clearly been greatly exaggerated. This was a performance reminiscent of their pomp that seemed to defy the circumstance, a record win over England at Twickenham that challenged so many of the assumptions made about both. No country for old men? There is life, and lots of it, left in this Irish band of brothers.\n\nThe verdant past of back-to-back Six Nations crowns may yet be beyond Ireland but here was a throwback showing of golden autumnal hue. Andy Farrell had backed his tried and trusted to hit the levels they had failed to of late and got what he had demanded. Ponderous? Plodding? Leggy after the Lions? Not so here: Jamison Gibson-Park fizzed with a vitality Ireland lacked in Paris on the opening night; Tadhg Beirne made mischief and menace; Stuart McCloskey stood tall to reduce English oak to acorns. For others, this was an international coming-of-age, wings Robert Baloucoune and Tommy O’Brien among them. An assured showing from Jack Crowley should make the No 10 shirt his for the foreseeable future. “It's a special day, 100 per cent, to come here and perform like that,” Farrell said of his side. “We're obviously delighted with that.”\n\nThe only trouble for Farrell’s beaming team in green is that their title hopes may well rest on England beating France in Paris. It is a scenario that feels fanciful after this. For as good as Ireland were, the hosts simply wilted in the face of their pressure to raise deeper questions about their direction.\n\nIf their performance against Scotland could be dismissed as something of an aberration on a day luck did not go their way, there was no rub of the green, really, for Ireland here. Excepting the scrum – how was the play, Mrs Lincoln? - the visitors were better in every facet.\n\n“It was bitterly disappointing,” Steve Borthwick conceded after a chastening day. “Huge credit to Ireland, they took their chances, their kicking game was excellent. Unfortunately for two weeks now, we have given ourselves a mountain to climb, given the opposition too many points and we have not got scoreboard presence. We will be looking closely at that and how I set the team up to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”\n\nIt had been Maro Itoje to lead England out, just the ninth man to reach a century of caps for his country, a great statesman, and great player, emerging with the understated calm and confidence that has defined him over a decade. A look to the heavens, perhaps in memory of his mother, and England’s captain was down to business.\n\nBorthwick and his squad had expressed frustration about their lacking physicality in the opening Edinburgh skirmishes, and there was a real punch to their first few carries, Freddie Steward hurling himself into the Irish line and Joe Heyes soon after. But a poor kick from George Ford squandered possession, before the eagerness to atone manifested itself in three sloppy, hurried set-pieces. An offside penalty in the English 22 granted the recalled Crowley the chance to open the scoring, and settle any nerves.\n\nThe hosts, meanwhile, carried a certain skittishness, a coltish feel they had seemed to shed during their long winning run. Ford, unbelievably, twice missed touch with punted penalties, while Steward and Ellis Genge fumbled within five metres of the line after sustained series deep in Irish territory.\n\nWhen Ireland at last got a chance to attack, they seized their chance. It looked all too easy for Baloucoune and O’Brien – on early for an injured James Lowe – to make metres in open acreage down the right, and England didn’t appropriately reform when the visitors went away to the left. Tom Curry, cynically, came in at the side to stem the flow; Gibson-Park tapped the resultant penalty quickly and zipped into the corner.\n\nFor a second week running, bad for England soon became worse. O’Brien took a steepling kick on the left and Stuart McCloskey strode away from Ollie Lawrence up the centre. A superb cover tackle from Steward was immediately cancelled out by his diving over the top of the ruck; off he went to the sin bin after Baloucoune finished it off. Like Irish thoroughbreds rounding the bend at Cheltenham, the wing pair were soon at it again, with O’Brien this time the scorer in the left corner.\n\nIt was all too much for some. Referee Andrea Piardi departed with an injury and neither Luke Cowan-Dickie nor Steward made it to half time, hooked as Borthwick sought emergency solutions – or perhaps locked the stable door. Even when England did finally register, through Fraser Dingwall on the stroke of the interval, it felt like heavy treading, a phase or five too many required to break Ireland apart.\n\nThe visitors, by contrast, found plenty of pasture. Caelan Doris was next to have a gallop as the travelling support sang of the Fields of Athenry. His break forced an infringement under the posts, for which Henry Pollock was shown yellow, and Dan Sheehan soon provided the finishing touches. England grew petulant: Itoje warned about his tone, Jack van Poortvliet conceding 10 metres with backchat.\n\nAgain, it appeared the game was long gone before the final quarter that England had come to command during their 12 consecutive wins. A neatly-worked Ollie Lawrence try, and accompanying yellow card to Jamie Osborne, re-instilled some fading hope, but it did not last long, two strikes of Crowley’s right boot adding to the advantage and all but killing home hope.\n\nWhen a returned Osborne punched over 10 minutes from time, there were sprouts of green all around, and Englishmen and women stumbled for the exit. Itoje – another off early even on his milestone day – wore a face of stone, like plenty of others. Even at the last, Ireland were scrambling back hard, McCloskey hauling down Marcus Smith to showcase his impressive speed, Baloucoune bundling Tommy Freeman towards touch. “It looked like we were hunting people down throughout the game,” Farrell hailed.\n\nSam Underhill’s late try varnished a home performance for the scrapheap, yet still a record margin of defeat to Ireland here remained. Itoje’s 100th Test would have been among the most painful. Where do England go next?",

    "fullText": "Burnley dented Chelsea's chances of Champions League qualification by snatching a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge, while Aston Villa also struck late to salvage a point against Leeds on Saturday.\n\nThe Blues climb into the Premier League's top four only on goal difference after they paid for failing to build on Joao Pedro's fourth-minute opener.\n\nChelsea were dominant until Wesley Fofana was sent off with 18 minutes remaining for a second yellow card.\n\nBurnley took full advantage as Zian Flemming headed in from a corner in the 93rd minute to boost their battle to beat the drop.\n\n\"It is not enough clean sheets and not enough basic values of defending set-pieces. That is something I have to address,\" said Chelsea boss Liam Rosenior.\n\n\"There were players on the pitch who were assigned to do their job and who didn't do their job. That is what cost us the two points.\"\n\nThe Clarets edge to within eight points of safety.\n\n- Milner sets appearance record -\n\nVilla defied the odds to keep pace with Arsenal and Manchester City in the title race until recent weeks, but a 1-1 draw continued their poor run at Villa Park.\n\nAnton Stach's spectacular free-kick from fully 40 yards (37 metres) at an angle caught out Emi Martinez at his near post to give Leeds the advantage.\n\nDaniel Farke's men have lost just twice in their last 16 games to relieve their fears of being dragged into a battle for survival.\n\nBut Tammy Abraham then snatched a point for Villa two minutes from time.\n\nFive Premier League sides are set to qualify for next season's Champions League thanks to the strong performance of English sides in European competition this season.\n\nBut Liverpool and Manchester United have the chance to close in when they face Nottingham Forest and Everton in the coming days.\n\nJames Milner set a new record of 654 Premier League appearances in Brighton's 2-0 win at Brentford.\n\nThe 40-year-old started for the Seagulls as they secured a first win in seven games to ease the pressure on boss Fabian Hurzeler.\n\n\"It's the drive and hunger. You want to be the best every day whether it's game or training,\" said Milner on the secret to his longevity.\n\nDiego Gomez drilled in the opening goal for the visitors after Ferdi Kadioglu's stunning strike came back off the bar.\n\nDanny Welbeck then pounced on some slack Brentford defending to double Brighton's lead just before half-time.\n\nManchester City can close to within two points of leaders Arsenal when they host Newcastle in Saturday's 2000 GMT kick-off.\n\nThe Gunners have breathed new life into City's title challenge with disappointing draws at Brentford and Wolves since Pep Guardiola's men last played in the Premier League.\n\nArsenal are in action on Sunday when they travel to local rivals Tottenham Hotspur in the north London derby.",

    "title": "Turns Out There Was Voter Fraud in Georgia – By Elon Musk",
    "description": "The state board of elections found Musk’s PAC sent prefilled ballot applications.",
    "fullText": "If Donald Trump’s administration really wants to find evidence of foreign interference in Georgia’s elections, then they need look no further than the president’s old friend Elon Musk and his shady super PAC.\n\nMembers of the Georgia State Elections Board voted Wednesday to issue a formal letter of reprimand to Musk’s America PAC over the billionaire technocrat’s illegal scheme to get Trump elected. Georgia, a key battleground state in 2024, was the target of aggressive campaigning by Trump’s team.\n\nIn October 2024, the Georgia secretary of state’s office launched an investigation after receiving numerous reports from residents across several counties saying they’d received partially prefilled absentee ballot applications from Musk’s America PAC, according to John Fervier, the State Elections Board’s chairman.\n\nThere was evidence to suggest America PAC had violated a state law that prohibits any person or entity, other than an authorized relative, to send an elector an absentee ballot application prefilled with the elector’s required information, according to Janice Johnston, the SEB’s vice chairman.\n\nAmerica PAC had also failed to display in a conspicuous location that this was not an official government publication, was not provided by the government, and was not a ballot, Johnston added.\n\nThe board swiftly voted to issue a letter of reprimand to America PAC.\n\nThis letter comes weeks after Trump suggested that his Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was spotted lurking around a federal raid at the election office in Fulton County, Georgia, because she was investigating foreign interference in elections.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the only evidence of meddling with people’s votes came from Trump’s own camp—the same thing happened in the 2020 election too.\n\nFox News doesn’t want a war with Iran and is trying to persuade its most famous viewer, Donald Trump, that it’s a bad idea.\n\nOn Fox & Friends Friday morning, host Rachel Campos-Duffy urged Trump to “make a better case” for “potentially going into another war.” Campos-Duffy is the wife of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, and was filling in for Ainsley Earhardt.\n\n“I don’t think the case has been made sufficiently for me,” Campos-Duffy said. “You read The New York Times. There’s a lot of people who also feel that way. If you’re going to get us potentially into a war, you have to explain why it matters to us.”\n\nCampos-Duffy added that she didn’t think that military action would aid protesters within Iran against the ruling clerical regime.\n\n“I just want to mention, you know, I do feel sorry for the protesters. Again, it’s not clear to me that doing this move, potentially going to war is necessarily going to help the protesters,” Campos-Duffy said. “I’d like to think that was true. Explain to me why. Explain to me why I should risk my military-aged boys potentially going into another war in the Middle East. I thought we were done with that.”\n\nBrian Kilmeade looks like he’s going to have a stroke as Rachel Campos Duffy goes way off script on the subject of Trump’s new Middle East war of choice which Fox has been working overtime to sell pic.twitter.com/Z3O8fxc0eP\n\nA Fox host openly questioning Trump’s rationale for military action, let alone one who happens to be the wife of a Cabinet secretary, suggests that there is dissension among MAGA and right-wing media over the prospect of attacking Iran. Trump told reporters Friday morning that he was considering a limited military strike to pressure Iran into a deal, and Reuters reports that the United States is in the advanced stages of planning such an attack, looking into targeting individuals and even regime change.\n\nWill Trump listen to his supporters who have doubts or even outright oppose military action? Right now, the military buildup around Iran is almost unprecedented, and a bombing campaign could start a dangerous and deadly war for all sides.\n\nPresident Trump said that he had a backup plan after the Supreme Court struck down his tariffs on Friday morning.\n\n“President Trump commented on the Supreme Court ruling striking down his tariffs while inside the White House breakfast with governors this morning, calling it a ‘disgrace,’ I’m told,” CNN’s Kaitlan Collins wrote on X. “He told those gathered that he has a backup plan.”\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled 6–3 Friday that Trump could not use a law meant for national emergencies to invoke global, sweeping tariffs.\n\nCNN’s Kristen Holmes reported that Trump became enraged when he learned about the decision, at one point ranting about “these f—king courts.”\n\n“Trump was speaking to a room full of U.S. governors at the White House when he was handed a note from an aide informing him of the Supreme Court decision, a source tells me,” wrote Reuters’s Jarrett Renshaw. “Trump was visibly frustrated and told the crowd that he had to do something about the courts, the source said.”\n\n“There is no exception to the major questions doctrine for emergency statutes. Nor does the fact that tariffs implicate foreign affairs render the doctrine inapplicable. The Framers gave ‘Congress alone’ the power to impose tariffs during peacetime,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote. “And the foreign affairs implications of tariffs do not make it any more likely that Congress would relinquish its tariff power through vague language, or without careful limits.”\n\nThere really isn’t any legal “backup plan” to a Supreme Court ruling, as that’s the entire point of the highest court in the land. We can only speculate as to what kind of extrajudicial last-ditch efforts Trump might take here.\n\nThis is how the Trump administration treats its veterans: Raid them, detain them, and leave them without any way to legally defend themselves.\n\nThat’s what happened to George Retes, a 26-year-old Army veteran who was arrested by ICE officials while commuting to his job in July, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday.\n\nRetes, a U.S. citizen and father of two, was driving to a farm in Ventura County, California, where he was supposed to work as a security guard on July 10. As he approached the farm, droves of protesters and federal agents were blocking the road. He tried to explain that he needed to get through for work, but the message—and his legal residency—did not matter.\n\nICE agents followed him back to his vehicle, where they proceeded to bang on his doors and give him conflicting information. One agent told him to “reverse,” while another agent told him to “​​pull over to the side,” according to an op-ed Retes penned for the San Francisco Chronicle in September.\n\nAs the situation escalated, officers lobbed tear gas at nearby protesters. The chemical irritant filled Retes’s car, causing him to choke.\n\n“Suddenly, an agent smashed my window and pepper-sprayed me,” Retes wrote. “I was pulled from the car, and one agent knelt on my neck while another knelt on my back.”\n\nThe veteran was zip-tied and left in the dirt for several hours before the agency sent him to Los Angeles’s Metropolitan Detention Center. They never bothered to check his identification.\n\nRetes was detained for three days, during which he was deprived of basic rights that are granted to suspected criminals, according to his attorneys. “He was not allowed a phone call, access to counsel, or a hearing. He was also subjected to inhumane treatment, not being allowed a shower to wash chemical irritants off his body,” the lawsuit reads.\n\nIn addition, the unwarranted and violent fiasco caused Retes to miss his daughter’s third birthday, and “exacerbated injuries he had sustained during his military service.”\n\nTo make matters worse, Retes never received an explanation for his arrest or for his continued detention at MDC, according to the lawsuit.\n\n“The officers, for their part, showed no interest in confirming George’s story,” the lawsuit reads. “No officer suggested he had broken any law, either. And no officer perceived him as a threat.”\n\nThe lawsuit was filed against the U.S. government, specifying unnamed individuals with the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Navy, the FBI, and Customs and Border Protection.\n\n“George’s rights were violated, and he is filing this lawsuit, not only to protect his own rights, but to have the rights of others be protected too,” Andrew Wimer, director of media relations at the Institute for Justice, told The Guardian. “What happened to George is clearly wrong. No one can be held for three days without being told what they’ve done wrong, without being charged with a crime. Americans deserve justice when their rights have been violated.”\n\nDonald Trump is losing the MAHA moms.\n\nThe New York Times reports that women who flocked to the president in the 2024 election and embraced his promise to tackle “toxins in our environments and pesticides in our food” feel betrayed after Trump signed an executive order Wednesday to boost U.S. production of glyphosate, the pesticide used in the weedkiller Roundup that is possibly linked to cancer and is the subject of numerous lawsuits, including one brought by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\n“Ensuring an adequate supply of elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides is thus crucial to the national security and defense, including food-supply security,” Trump’s order read.\n\nAs a result, these women, some of whom embraced the moniker “MAHA moms” after Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Again” slogan, are now rethinking their support for the president.\n\n“Women feel like they were lied to, that MAHA movement is a sham,” health and wellness podcaster Alex Clark, who works for the Trump-allied group Turning Point USA, told the Times. “How am I supposed to rally these women to vote red in the midterms? How can we win their trust back? I am unsure if we can.”\n\nSome MAHA moms have directed their anger at the president, but others question why Kennedy is backing production of a chemical he has criticized. On the Instagram page of Vani Hari, who promotes healthy eating and advises the White House on food policy, several commenters were upset with Kennedy.\n\n“This begs the question why didn’t sec Kennedy have a say and stop it,” wrote one person, while another asked “Where is RFK Jr.?” Neither Kennedy’s office nor the Trump administration has addressed whether Kennedy was part of any discussions about the order before it was issued.\n\nThe founder of Moms Across America, Zen Honeycutt, has led a campaign against glyphosate, petitioning stores not to sell it and supporting testing for pesticide residue. She called Trump’s order “an egregious offense to what he promised,” in an interview with the Times.\n\nTrump’s order also has pushback from Republican Representative Thomas Massie, who posted on X Thursday that he would introduce legislation to overturn the order. It seems that Trump has started a fight between MAGA and MAHA.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled Friday to undo Donald Trump’s illegal Liberation Day tariffs, taking away the president’s favorite toy after he used it to hit his allies.\n\nIn the court’s 6–3 majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that Trump’s invocation of an emergency in order to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act was a massive overreach of Congress’s authority and flew in the face of decades of precedent.\n\n“There is no exception to the major questions doctrine for emergency statutes. Nor does the fact that tariffs implicate foreign affairs render the doctrine inapplicable. The Framers gave ‘Congress alone’ the power to impose tariffs during peacetime,” Roberts wrote. “And the foreign affairs implications of tariffs do not make it any more likely that Congress would relinquish its tariff power through vague language, or without careful limits.\n\n“Accordingly, the President must ‘point to clear congressional authorization’ to justify his extraordinary assertion of that power,” Roberts wrote. “He cannot.”\n\nRoberts was joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch, Kentanji Brown Jackson, and Amy Coney Barrett. In his concurring opinion, Gorsuch wrote, “Whatever else might be said about Congress’s work in IEEPA, it did not clearly surrender to the President the sweeping tariff power he seeks to wield.”\n\nConservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh both wrote dissenting opinions, and Justice Samuel Alito and Thomas joined Kavanaugh’s.\n\nTrump imposed his so-called “reciprocal tariffs” in April 2025 using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a rule that allows the president to regulate commerce in case of a national emergency—but doesn’t actually include the word “tariff.”\n\nThe Trump administration initially claimed that the “reciprocal tariffs” were simply a tool to negotiate improved trade deals with other countries in order to promote domestic manufacturing and thwart drug trafficking.\n\nBut it quickly became clear that the deals were neither binding nor permanent. In reality, Trump’s tariffs were intended to be ever-changing, a whip to extend across the world at his whim. The results? Trump has hurt U.S. manufacturing, driven up prices, and strained relationships with U.S. allies.\n\nTrump claimed in mid-January that should the Supreme Court rule against his tariff policy, the U.S. would be forced to “pay back … Hundreds of Billions of Dollars” in investments made by companies and countries hoping to avoid his steep tariffs.\n\n“When these Investments are added, we are talking about Trillions of Dollars!” Trump wrote. “It would be a complete mess, and almost impossible for our country to pay.”\n\nTrade Representative Jamieson Greer told The New York Times on January 19 that in the case of an unfavorable decision, Trump planned to simply ignore the ruling. He would impose a new set of tariffs that will “start the next day” in order “to respond to the problems the president has identified.”\n\nThe FBI conducted four interviews with a woman who accused President Donald Trump of sexually assaulting her as a child, and Trump’s Justice Department gave all four of those interviews to Ghislaine Maxwell before her trial, as reported by Roger Sollenberger. Only one of those interviews is in the publicly searchable Epstein files—and it was removed and put back earlier this week.\n\n“By choosing not to release three FBI interviews with an underage Trump accuser—interviews the DOJ gave to Maxwell at trial—Trump’s DOJ allowed Maxwell to retain potential blackmail over the president,” Sollenberger wrote Friday on X. “But that leverage over Trump vanishes if DOJ made them public, as law requires.”\n\nThe woman sat down for the interviews with the FBI after filing a lawsuit against the Epstein estate. In the publicly available interview, she claims that she was “brutally and forcibly battered, assaulted, and raped by these other men she met through Epstein. On one occasion, one of these prominent men forcibly slapped Jane Doe 4 in the face after she was forced to perform oral sex on him. This same man forcibly raped her, penetrating her both vaginally and anally. On information and belief, Epstein was aware of and, indeed encouraged, the assault of Jane Doe 4 by these other men.”\n\nThis lawsuit matches the FBI’s lone public interview with her, in which she names Trump.\n\n“[REDACTED] stated Epstein introduced her to Trump who subsequently forced her head down to his exposed penis which she subsequently bit,” the FBI said. “In response, Trump punched her in the head and kicked her out.” This allegedly occurred in the mid-1980s when she was “approximately 13-15 years old.”\n\nTrump has of course denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThere are three more interviews that this woman has with the FBI, and we don’t know what else she says or who else she names. But Maxwell does.\n\nLabor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer’s husband has been banned from the department’s headquarters in Washington after he allegedly sexually assaulted two female staffers, The New York Times reported Thursday.\n\nDr. Shawn DeRemer, a 57-year-old anesthesiologist from Portland, Oregon, will no longer be able to visit his wife at work, after at least two female staffers told officials that he touched them inappropriately. A building restriction notice viewed by the Times put it gently: “If Mr. DeRemer attempts to enter, he is to be asked to leave.”\n\nOne of the incidents, which occurred during working hours, was caught by security cameras, people familiar with the matter told the Times. The footage showed DeRemer giving a female staffer an extended embrace, and it was reviewed as part of a criminal investigation, one of the people told the paper.\n\nA police report documenting a December incident of forced sexual conduct at the Labor Department was filed by Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department in late January.\n\nConcerns about DeRemer were initially raised in January, as part of an internal investigation into alleged misconduct by his wife. In an explosive complaint to the Inspector General’s Office, Chavez-DeRemer was accused of abusing her position by having an inappropriate sexual relationship with a member of her security detail.\n\nShe was also accused of drinking during the workday and of committing travel fraud by making her chief of staff schedule official taxpayer-funded trips she could use to see friends and family. Her lawyer has denied these allegations.\n\nThe Trump administration has taken more than a year to roll out a fraction of the Epstein files, but literally overnight, Donald Trump decided that it would be no problem at all to dump everything the government has on alien life.\n\nThe president announced late Thursday that he would direct agencies to “begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters.”\n\nTrump noted the spontaneous release was due to the public’s “tremendous interest,” though that’s not the entire story.\n\nHours earlier, Trump was caught off guard by a reporter’s question relating to Barack Obama’s recent revelation that aliens are real.\n\n“Have you seen any evidence of nonhuman visitors to earth?” Fox News’s Peter Doocy asked Trump on Air Force One.\n\n“Well, he gave classified information, he’s not supposed to be doing that,” said Trump, who was charged for mishandling and illegally keeping classified documents after losing the 2020 election.\n\n“So aliens are real?” Doocy pressed.\n\n“Well I don’t know if they’re real or not, I can tell you he gave classified information; he’s not supposed to be doing that. He made a big mistake,” Trump replied, cracking that the only aliens he was aware of in the U.S. were “illegals.”\n\nObama casually fessed to his belief in aliens during a speed round of playful questions on the No Lie With Brian Tyler Cohen podcast Saturday, informing listeners that “they’re real, but I haven’t seen them.” The former president added that there was no facility storing aliens at Area 51, “unless there’s this enormous conspiracy, and they hid it from the president of the United States.”\n\nHe clarified his comments the following day, writing on social media that the universe is so vast that the likelihood of extraterrestrial life is “statistically” probable.\n\n“But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!” Obama posted.\n\nTrump’s eagerness to satiate apparent public demand on the existence of aliens only further underscores the absurdity of the endless delays holding back the full, legally mandated release of the Epstein files.\n\nRecent reports indicate that the DOJ has only released a fraction of the Epstein files, potentially holding on to upward of 50 terabytes that the agency has not yet disclosed. The recent releases, which include millions of pages of documents, amount to roughly 300 gigabytes, or 2 percent of the estimated total.\n\nPresident Trump is continuing his crusade against voting rights, claiming that mail-in ballots are “crooked as hell” and that eliminating them will guarantee Republican dominance of elections for the next half-century.\n\n“Mail-in ballots are crooked as hell. We’re the only country in the world that use this type of mail-in ballot, the only country in the world,” Trump said at a rally in Rome, Georgia, on Thursday. “I’ll tell you what, Republicans have to win this one. We’ll never lose a race for fifty years, we won’t lose a race.”\n\nHe then launched into his broader attack on voting rights, which many see as a last-ditch attempt to salvage the GOP’s chances in the November midterm elections, which are predicted to go poorly for them.\n\n“We want voter ID, we want proof of citizenship, and we don’t want mail-in ballots except for the military far away, except for people that are ill, disabled, or people that are away. Even for a vacation! We’ll be generous,” Trump added.\n\nTrump: \"Mail in ballots are crooked as hell. Republicans have to win this one. We'll never lose a race for 50 years.\" pic.twitter.com/5c3X98vW7g\n\nTrump had no complaints about mail-in ballots when he won the presidency in 2024. And the U.S. is not the only country to use them: 34 countries and territories use some kind of postal voting. Twelve even allow all voters to vote by mail, including the U.K., Germany, Poland, Greece, and Canada.",

    "fullText": "I have seen many times a thought on LinkedIn: “Make yourself irreplaceable at work.” It sounds like career wisdom. Become so essential that the company can’t function without you. But here’s what I’ve learned after years as a software developer and team captain: being irreplaceable is actually holding you back.\n\nThis article is part of the Knowledge Silos series:\n\nLast year, I took my first three-week vacation in my career. As a Team Captain I was a bit worried how things will go. You know what happened? The team thrived. They followed our established rituals, delivered value to customers, and handled everything smoothly. No emergencies, no urgent calls, no disasters.\n\nThis wasn’t an accident. It was the result of specific actions we took to build team resilience.\n\nBeing replaceable isn’t about being redundant. It’s about building resilient systems and empowering teams.\n\nWhen you’re the single person who knows how something works, you might feel secure, important, irreplaceable. But consider the real consequences:\n\nI’ve seen brilliant developers trapped in the same role for years because their managers couldn’t afford to move them. They became victims of their own “irreplaceability.”\n\nA knowledge silo forms when critical information stays trapped within one person or one group, with no transfer to the rest of the team.\n\nIt’s not always one lone expert. It can be an entire subgroup — three developers who always pick tasks from the same module because that’s what they know, while the other five never touch it. It feels efficient. It’s comfortable. And it quietly turns into a fragile dependency nobody notices until someone goes on vacation.\n\nThat’s the thing about silos: they don’t form from bad intentions. They form from convenience.\n\nSound familiar? Maybe it’s you. Maybe it’s someone on your team. Either way, it’s a risk.\n\nIn software development, we talk about the “bus factor.” How many team members could be hit by a bus before a project fails? (That’s dark. Let’s say they missed the bus.)\n\nIf your team’s bus factor is 1 (you?), that’s a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nDo you know, that in big corporations and governments, there are specific rules that people crucial for operations cannot travel together in the same bus, plane, or train? That’s how serious single points of failure are. Imagine this: half of your team is late for the flight to a conference — Congrats! You accidentally mitigated a risk.\n\nYou can’t fix what you don’t measure. Here’s a practical assessment framework to evaluate your team’s knowledge distribution.\n\nAsk these questions about your team:\n\nFor each critical area, count how many people can handle it independently:\n\nAnything above 3 is a resilent team that mastered knowledge sharing.\n\nThe bus factor is not a single score for your whole team. It’s calculated per area. Each critical area has its own number, and your weakest area is your real risk.\n\nHere’s how to do it in three steps:\n\nList your five most critical areas. Think: deployment, architecture decisions, customer escalations, legacy system knowledge, on-call incident response. Pick the ones where a gap would actually hurt.\n\nFor each area, write down every person who can handle it independently. Without asking for help.\n\nCount the names. That count is the bus factor for that area.\n\nI built a ready-to-fill Team Bus Factor Calculator PDF template for this exercise — you can grab it at the end of the article.\n\nHere’s what a filled table might look like:\n\nIn this example, the team’s real bus factor is 1: because two critical areas depend on a single person. Even though onboarding looks healthy, one bus (or one resignation, sick leave, longer vacation) breaks the whole system.\nNotice Anna. She’s carrying half the team. She also probably hasn’t taken a vacation since she accidentally became important.\n\nIf you see one name listed across multiple areas, or just one name in any row, that’s your red flag. You don’t sum the scores. You look for the lowest number. A bus factor of 1 anywhere is a single point of failure, no matter how healthy the rest of the table looks.\n\nThe goal isn’t to replace experts. It’s to ensure expertise is shared, documented, and distributed so the team stays resilient even when someone is unavailable.\n\nIf your bus factor score is below 3 in critical areas, you have an on organizational risk. It a good rule of thumb to have at least 2 people responsible for each piece of the project.\n\nBut here’s the good news: this isn’t permanent. Knowledge silos can be broken down systematically, without grinding productivity to a halt.\n\nNow you’ve identified your single points of failure. The question is: how do you fix it without sacrificing velocity? In Part 2, I’ll show you the exact 4-step system my team used to increase our bus factor from 1 to 4 while maintaining velocity.\n\nDon’t miss Part 2 — subscribe below and I’ll send it straight to your inbox when it’s out.\n\nDownload the Team Bus Factor Calculator – A free PDF template to map your team’s knowledge distribution and identify critical risks.

A ChatGPT-designed workshop on creating a 2026 vision for one's life was about to begin, and two of my friends were fighting over who would get the last brown leather-bound journal.\n\nIt was a little before Lunar New Year, a holiday rooted in honoring the past while setting intentions for the future. And this year, instead of enjoying fireworks and celebrations, I hosted something much quieter. I invited my circle into my home to answer several journal prompts around career, love, fitness, and finances.\n\nFor me, January 1 comes with too much pressure; you may remember me writing about my intentionally slow start to the New Year. Lunar New Year, however, gifted me a second chance at intention. And what resulted around my dining room table was the perfect anecdote to help me game-plan my goals.

    "fullText": "My whole life, it felt like I was promised that if I got an undergraduate degree from a great university, I would get a good job and build a stable life for myself. Reality has been a lot messier.\n\nIn May 2024, I graduated from New York University with a degree in media studies and a minor in the entertainment business. Throughout college, I held multiple internships in political campaigns and magazines, was active on my school's newspaper, networked, did well in my classes, and learned as much as I could.\n\nNYU was my dream school for so long, and my experience turned out exactly how I thought it would. I fell in love with New York. I was living my dream life: spending late nights with my best friends, exploring the entertainment scene, discovering new restaurants and bars, and taking advantage of every park the city had to offer.\n\nBut when I couldn't land a job after college, I had to leave my dreams behind and move back home with my parents.\n\nI always felt inspired and hopeful in New York, like I finally arrived somewhere that matched the energy I had always carried inside me.\n\nI did everything I could to stay. I applied to many entry-level jobs during my last semester of college and the summer after graduation. I knew I wanted to pursue a career in journalism, so I mostly applied for entry-level reporting and copyediting jobs, as well as some marketing and social media management roles.\n\nI was able to score some interviews, but none turned into full-time offers.\n\nWhen my lease in my East Village apartment ended in July, I faced a hard truth: I couldn't afford to stay. I also didn't want to ask my parents for more financial help, knowing how much they had already supported me through school.\n\nThough I have a part-time job mentoring high school seniors through their college applications, I knew it wouldn't be enough to sustain living in New York while I tried to find a full-time job, and I had no idea how long it would take.\n\nI grew up in Santa Clarita, Calif., about 32 miles north of Los Angeles. It's a safe, quiet suburb where the pace of life is much slower than in New York.\n\nComing back after living in New York was a serious whiplash. My childhood bedroom suddenly felt smaller and quieter, and the absence of my college friends made the town feel emptier than I remembered.\n\nThere are some parts I am grateful for, though. After almost four years of seeing them only a handful of times a year, I finally get to spend more time with my parents. I also hated the harsh East Coast winters and definitely do not miss schlepping my Trader Joe's groceries down 10 blocks and then up four flights of stairs.\n\nThe pace here is gentler, the streets are quieter, and while it's not Manhattan, it's given me a space to breathe and reflect in ways I couldn't before.\n\nVisiting New York every few months reminds me why I fell in love with the city, but living at home has also shown me that slowing down is not the same thing as standing still. I've been creative with my career, focusing on writing, networking, and mentoring, while appreciating the small moments I took for granted in the city.\n\nI sometimes catch myself wondering, \"If I did this differently, would I be living and working in New York by now?\"\n\nI have to constantly remind myself that I am only 23 and I have a lot of life to live. New York will always be there. There have been many times when I doubted my career in journalism and considered quitting, but I love writing, and I have never been the type to give up.\n\nI am still looking for a full-time writing job in New York, but I'm learning not to let it define my entire identity.\n\nI am such a strong believer that life happens for a reason. Maybe living in Santa Clarita again is teaching me lessons I need before I return to the city I love.\n\nLiz Lindain is a freelance entertainment journalist based in Southern California.

    "fullText": "I'm 39, and my retirement plan is haphazard, chaotic, and borderline nonexistent. I feel a lot of shame around this fact because I should know better.\n\nMy first job out of college was at PBS, where I opened a TIAA retirement account at 22. Somewhere in the intervening 18 years, the retirement accounts at PBS switched from TIAA to Fidelity. I now get notifications from both, and it's confusing.\n\nAfter PBS, I worked for a public relations agency that most certainly had a 401(k) plan, and I absolutely didn't After that, I worked at Redbox, where I again didn't enroll in a retirement plan.\n\nI've had a twisty-turny career path, including a pandemic-era six-year stint as a startup founder developing a new tech product for book lovers. During that time, I worried about money every day, so I wasn't saving anything for retirement.\n\nSo that leaves me with a string of sparse, underfunded retirement accounts, regrets about the past, and worries about the future. I'm deep in the middle of what I call \"retirement planning paralysis.\"\n\nI've shied away from retirement planning throughout my career for the same reason I didn't freeze my eggs or plan for any aspect of the future: Today is the only day that is promised.\n\nI've always tried to live in the present because it feels presumptuous to plan the future. And the future always felt very far away, so it was easy to put planning off — especially in my 20s and 30s.\n\nNow, with 40 looming, I still feel uncertain about the future, but I also see my past avoidant behaviors as ones riddled with excuses and justifications. I suddenly realized: Just because I don't know how things will turn out doesn't mean I can't plan for future me.\n\nToday, I'm working full time at a B2B PR agency, and I'm finally maxing out my 401(k). I've now doubled my total retirement savings from my previous 15+ years of corporate employment.\n\nBut I still have at least two, maybe three, different retirement accounts. I know I should combine them all, but I don't know where to start or the best way to go about that.\n\nI know that 401(k)s can be rolled over or rolled up, so I have to figure out how to get this ball rolling, but I'm still struggling to find the motivation. It feels like total planning paralysis. This is my next big hurdle.\n\nOptimistically, I would love to be in my late 60s and retired. I want to travel, hike, and volunteer. I like to imagine that I'll relax by reading books in my little cozy nook of a cabin in the hills of a forest overlooking a lake.\n\nBut more realistically, I see myself working into my 70s, not by choice but necessity — joining the growing ranks of older Americans who can't afford to stop. My current juncture makes me think of a famous Joni Mitchell line: \"It's got me hoping for the future and worrying about the past.\"\n\nI do regret some of my past choices, but I'm addressing them now. Writing this essay is my first step out of paralysis. I'm also scheduling a meeting with a financial advisor next week.\n\nLastly, I'm telling my friends about my retirement anxiety. I'm learning that admitting I'm overwhelmed doesn't make me a failure; it makes me honest. And being honest is a good first step.",

    "fullText": "Steve Hanke says there's excessive buzz around AI — and it could end badly.\n\nThe veteran trader and economist told Business Insider by email that he agrees with Yann LeCun, Meta's former chief AI scientist and a pioneer in the field, who's warned that large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT just aren't that revolutionary.\n\nHanke quoted a speech by LeCun in the spring of 2024, where he said: \"We're easily fooled into thinking they are intelligent because of their fluency with language, but really, their understanding of reality is very superficial.\"\n\nLeCun added that the chatbots have their uses but \"on the path towards human-level intelligence, an LLM is basically an off-ramp, a distraction, a dead end.\"\n\nHanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, said he's \"on LeCun's side of the court\" and considers AI to be \"overhyped and potentially dangerous.\"\n\nHe told Business Insider last October that whether the market's exuberance turned out to be rational or irrational would \"largely depend on whether the AI firms' spectacular revenue forecasts hold water.\"\n\n\"It might be wise to buckle your seat belt,\" he added.\n\nHanke was the president of Toronto Trust Argentina when it was the world's best-performing market mutual fund in 1995. He also served as an economic advisor to President Ronald Reagan.\n\nDespite some recent jitters, the AI boom seems to be going strong with OpenAI reportedly close to raising north of $100 billion at a potential $850 billion valuation. ChatGPT's maker crossed $20 billion in annualized revenue last year.\n\nThe so-called \"hyperscalers\" racing to build the infrastructure to power the AI boom have forecasted some truly mind-boggling outlays.\n\nMeta, Amazon, and Alphabet recently projected that their capital expenditures for 2026 could reach a combined $520 billion, and Microsoft is also on track to invest more than $100 billion this calendar year.\n\nLeCun recently departed Meta after working at Facebook and Instagram's parent company for more than a decade. He left to found Paris-based AMI Labs and develop open-source AI that could truly comprehend and model the physical world, not just language.\n\nHanke isn't alone in sounding the alarm on the AI boom. Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame has warned tech giants are overinvesting in microchips that could quickly become obsolete, and could see disappointing returns.\n\nJeremy Grantham, a bubble guru and GMO's long-term investment strategist, has cautioned that previous transformative technologies, such as railroads and the internet, were marked by initial bubbles that inevitably popped, and he expects the same to happen with AI.\n\nHowever, AI champions from Elon Musk to Sam Altman have predicted the tech will supercharge productivity and generate huge profits, so the run-up in valuations is more than justified.",

    "description": "The Army's first annual Best Drone Warfighter competition shed some new light on the ideal backgrounds and skill sets for drone pilots.",
    "fullText": "The US Army used its first Best Drone Warfighter competition not just to test skills, officials say, but to identify what makes a top drone operator — and who in the force is best suited for the job.\n\nRather than training every soldier to fly drones, the Army is using competition to identify the skill sets of top drone operators and whether there are specific roles within units that would make the most sense for working with uncrewed aerial systems.\n\nThe effort reflects a broader shift from treating drone flying as something for all soldiers to approaching it as a specialized skill set that requires the right aptitude, training, and sustained practice.\n\nThe inaugural drone competition took place this week at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, gathering teams from across active, Reserve, and National Guard units. There were no requirements on what types of soldiers could participate or where they came from.\n\nRather, \"it was just send your best UAS operators,\" Col. Nicholas Ryan, director of Army UAS Transformation at the Aviation Center of Excellence, told reporters, prompting a mix of operators with different backgrounds and expertise.\n\nOver three days, soldiers competed in multiple events, testing their piloting skills. The first was an obstacle course that operators navigated using first-person-view drones.\n\nThe second was a hunter-killer scenario in which teams used a reconnaissance drone to survey an array of targets and decide which were highest priority for simulated strikes with one-way attack drones. The competition didn't involve any kinetic strikes; instead, soldiers flew the drones into nets on the targets.\n\nThe third event was focused on innovation. Soldiers could build, modify, and test their own drones.\n\nRyan said that the Army was taking notes throughout the competition on who the top operators were, calling it talent management.\n\n\"At the end of the day,\" he said, \"it's not about receiving trophies or awards,\" it is about identifying what sets the top drone operators apart and figuring out how they developed those skills. The goal, he said, is to understand \"what lessons can we take from this to find out who the best operator is and how they became the best operator. What skills and resources and training allowed them to become the best operator?\"\n\nSoldiers in the US and Ukraine have noticed that gamers make excellent drone pilots, as do soldiers who have experience piloting hobby drones.\n\n\"That's something we're absolutely looking at right now,\" Ryan said.\n\nArmy leaders have previously noted a correlation between soldiers who grew up playing video games — or who are active gamers — and drone proficiency.\n\nTroops who game have shown quick reflexes, precise hand-eye coordination, and strong spatial awareness that make them competent with drones.\n\nAt an exercise in Germany last fall, a US Army captain told Business Insider that the top pilots were soldiers who \"when they got off on Fridays, then go and play video games.\"\n\nThe Army has been restructuring its approach to drone warfare, rewriting its training and focusing on integrating soldiers with small drone training into front-line units. Lessons and approaches are being shared across the service, building a broader doctrine on how the Army is adopting drones.\n\nRyan said that the service is realizing that flying drones needs to be a dedicated assignment. \"You can't be a squad rifleman and a drone operator,\" he said, explaining that \"it's one or the other because you have to have the level of skill and expertise in operating and employing the drones. That's what you have to be good at and train at and focus on for most of your time.\"\n\nOther Army officials said efforts like the competition were demonstrating where drones best fit in a formation and what aspects of training are most important to maintain these highly perishable skills.\n\nFor the most part, soldiers flew their drones successfully, but the Army did take note of communication breakdowns as soldiers went through the hunter-killer lane, specifically getting drones into position and identifying and simulating strikes on targets.\n\n\"That's an example of something we didn't anticipate, but it's absolutely standing out as that is something we as an Army need to do better on,\" Ryan said. \"If we're going to proliferate these drones and want them to be more effective and lethal, we just need to improve on how our soldiers talk to each other to communicate when they're using them.\"\n\nIn future iterations of the Best Drone Warfighter competition, the Army hopes to include kinetic elements as well as electronic warfare and jamming to better replicate real-world scenarios.",

A 2023 Pew Research report found that Americans are divided on open marriages. Of about 5,000 US adults surveyed, 37% found open marriages completely unacceptable. Younger generations approved more than anyone else: roughly half of 18- to 29-year-olds were accepting of open marriages.\n\nDr. Justin R. Garcia, the executive director of the Kinsey Institute, has also witnessed the growing popularity of non-monogamy in his work.\n\n\"People were talking about swinging in the 60s and 70s, but the language and the amount of attention to it changed, particularly over the last decade,\" Garcia told Business Insider, citing Amy C. Moors, a sexuality scientist who noticed a steady increase in people searching for terms related to polyamory between 2006 and 2015.\n\nHowever, showing interest and actually engaging in the activity are two different things. In his new book, \"The Intimate Animal,\" Garcia said that research from his lab at the Kinsey Institute, one of the most prominent research centers for human sexuality and relationships, found that one in five single adults in the US, out of about 8,700 studied, have had some kind of consensual, non-monogamous relationship at some point in their lives.\n\nWhen looking at the past five years in another study of Garcia's, however, that number dropped significantly, suggesting that \"more people try it than decide that it is a lifelong relationship structure for them,\" Garcia said. \"In my social networks, that's been my experience as well.\"\n\nIt doesn't mean that they never work, he added. According to multiple studies, \"while consensually open relationships might not work for everyone, or even for most people, there are many people for whom they do work perfectly well,\" he wrote in his book. Those in happy non-monogamous relationships, for example, don't fare psychologically or emotionally worse than content monogamous couples.\n\n\"In terms of who's a good candidate for it? My cheeky answer, but it's actually true, is those people who really want to do it,\" Garcia said. \"It's similar to 'What's the right amount of sex that we should be having?' It's as much as you want.\"\n\nStill, that doesn't mean open relationships work for everyone. Based on his research, Garcia shared the most common reasons non-monogamous partnerships don't work out.\n\nOne of the most common challenges to non-monogamous partnerships might be our own biology.\n\n\"We have such a fundamental, evolved drive to form intense pair bonds,\" Garcia said, ones that biologists theorize helped us thrive as a species over time. In his book, he said that \"our brains don't appear particularly well-suited to processing intimacy with more than one partner at a time,\" be it another romantic partner or a sexual fling. Even fantasies of threesomes, Garcia said, more often involve an existing partner.\n\nIf romance is most often defined by sustained attention and effort, then it becomes more difficult when one or both partners have other people to focus on. Introducing a new partner into a shared home can cause friction with a spouse, as can skipping dinner with a spouse to spend it with another significant other.\n\nGarcia said one of the \"prevailing rationales\" for consensual non-monogamy is having \"too much love to give.\" However, he wrote, the opposite is true: \"Most people don't have the biological, psychological, and social tools to love more than one person at a time.\"\n\nIn his research, Garcia said the happiest non-monogamous couples have the same thing in common: \"They tend to engage in a lot of communication.\"\n\nOne 20-person polycule, for instance, uses a software engineer strategy called \"agile scrum\" to resolve any relationship issues. It involves monthly reviews, discussion questions, and action points.\n\n\"Even casual polyamorous encounters take substantial effort and negotiation,\" Garcia wrote, including lots of communication. \"Who needs more touch? Less? Who is feeling neglected? Who needs more time with whom? What is the state of things between each member of the polycule and each of the others?\"\n\nSome people find that level of frequent, in-depth communication builds their intimacy and brings them closer. Still, for many people, it's just too much work.\n\nIn any healthy relationship, Garcia said there's a basic framework you have to follow: \"There's me, there's you, and there's us.\" What might make one person happier, like having more romantic partners, might make the other feel neglected.\n\nFor a non-monogamous relationship to work, \"you want to be able to both navigate your feelings of jealousy,\" Garcia said. Furthermore, he added, it helps if you actively enjoy knowing that your partner is with others.\n\nThe last reason you should be in a polyamorous or open relationship is because you want it to \"fix\" your current relationship. Often, he wrote, \"the same issues that plague monogamous relationships — mismatched libidos, jealousy, boredom, and more — tend to surface in consensually non-monogamous ones.\" In fact, he added, they can multiply when partners aren't communicating or devoting enough time to each other.\n\n\"As one of my friends who had attempted to form a polycule once told me, 'It didn't work,'\" Garcia wrote. \"'I just pissed off two women instead of one.'\"",

    "description": "Greg Coffey's Kirkoswald made a large bet against Oracle going into 2026, regulatory filings show.",
    "fullText": "The software sell-off hasn't been pretty.\n\nThanks to fears that artificial intelligence would make software businesses obsolete, stocks like Salesforce, Oracle, Workday, and more have shed trillions of dollars in market cap.\n\nWho in the $5.2 trillion hedge fund industry has been stung by this sell-off isn't entirely clear. Still, a recent release of regulatory filings of funds' holdings reveals which managers were most exposed to the sector at the start of the year. It's unclear if these funds sold their stakes before the sell-off began or have weathered the losses.\n\nOne manager who stands out is Brennan Diaz's Fernbridge Capital, a stockpicking fund with roughly $2 billion in assets. The firm began the year with more than 22% of its portfolio in Salesforce, its largest position. Its second-largest bet, which made up nearly 15% of its portfolio at the start of 2026, was in Workday.\n\nThe two stocks are down more than 25% to start the year, as of publication time.\n\nDiaz, a former portfolio manager at Viking Global, started the fund in 2019, according to his LinkedIn profile, after a stint at Junto Capital, another fund started by a Viking alum.\n\nContour Asset Management, run by David Meyer, a former portfolio manager at European multistrategy fund Brummer & Partners, started new positions in Salesforce and Workday in the fourth quarter of 2025, filings show. The manager's Salesforce bet was its third-largest holding at 2026's onset.\n\nMeanwhile, long-running activist fund ValueAct has Salesforce as its largest position, accounting for more than 11% of its portfolio, and added to its stake in the fourth quarter. The manager has been invested in the stock for years, and its chief investment officer, Mason Morfit, is on Salesforce's board of directors.\n\nSean Ma, who ran Hong Kong-based Snow Lake Capital before relocating to California, started M37 Management to invest in AI and infrastructure. His firm bought 100,000 shares of Oracle in the fourth quarter, making Larry Ellison's company Ma's second-largest holding at the start of 2026.\n\nThe managers above did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAt least one fund was skeptical enough about Oracle coming into the year that it was willing to bet heavily against the tech giant.\n\nKirkoswald's Greg Coffey, known as the \"Wizard of Oz\" for his macro prowess, bought put options on Oracle worth close to $400 million in the fourth quarter, filings show. Put options are contracts that allow an investor to sell shares of a company at a set price for a limited period.\n\nManagers use them to bet against stocks they expect to decline in price over the life of the contract, because the structure allows them to sell a stock for more than it is worth, generating a profit from the difference.\n\nIt's unclear from the filings how long Kirkoswald's options contracts were for or whether the firm has closed any positions. The firm declined to comment.",

    "title": "Thousands of military families are stuck on childcare waitlists. More spots may not be enough to fix the deeper problems.",
    "description": "The military childcare waitlist affects thousands of families, highlighting gaps in support for working spouses and service members.",
    "fullText": "There are an estimated 7,800 children on US military childcare waitlists. Military families and advocates say the number masks deeper shortfalls that continue to sideline working spouses and strain service members.\n\nLawmakers raised the issue during a recent congressional hearing, calling the persistent backlog a quality-of-life problem, even as the waitlist has notably dropped from 12,000 children in 2024.\n\nAdvocates told Business Insider that the number isn't the whole picture and excludes families who've given up out of frustration or can't use base centers that lack evening, weekend, or specialized care.\n\n\"We can't say that we are a military that cares about our families if we pretend to provide childcare and then we've got a waitlist that's got 7,800 babies waiting on it,\" Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren said to service senior enlisted leaders during last week's hearing.\n\nNone of the service leaders present disputed that figure.\n\nMaster Chief Petty Officer of the Navy John Perryman acknowledged that the Navy still has roughly 1,400 children in unmet need status, while Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force David Wolfe said his service's waitlist stands at around 2,700, though there are efforts underway to open new spots.\n\nIt is not clear how the remaining waitlisted children are divided between other services.\n\nIn 2022, the Air Force had 95,000 children under 5 but space for only about 23,000 in its child development centers, a 2023 service report on childcare found.\n\nAn Air Force spokesperson attributed that disparity to the number of children entering and leaving care throughout the year. \"The annual number served will not correlate with daily capacity and can be significantly higher,\" they said.\n\nNot all families require on-base care. But the report added that more facility construction alone would not be a \"viable solution to meet all potential demand.\"\n\nKayla Corbitt, a military spouse and the founder of a nonprofit dedicated to helping military families find reliable childcare, told Business Insider that many families lose hope amid long waits. Staying on the waitlist, she said, requires logging on every couple of months to reconfirm before families are automatically disenrolled.\n\nAnd for some families, the barriers extend beyond backlogs.\n\n\"Anyone needing evening care, weekend care, shift work care, which is a lot of the military, they aren't going to try to get on that waitlist,\" Corbitt said, explaining that most child development centers, or CDCs, on bases don't offer late evening or very early morning care needed for troops on 24-hour duty or for deployed service members with spouses who work unusual hours.\n\nAdditionally, children with special needs face significant obstacles in finding care, Corbitt said, as many CDCs are not equipped to provide care, and the policies sometimes vary from facility to facility, making it hard for families to know what to expect when they move.\n\nBrigit Schneider, an Air Force spouse and mother of three children, wants to return to work as a financial planner to better support her family, but because her local childcare center won't accept children with feeding tubes, one of her young children is shut out.\n\n\"From a special needs mom perspective, it's an extra layer of challenge,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nSchneider pays nearly $1,000 a month for one child to receive on-base childcare, another child is receiving private care due to the severity of their disability, and a third is at home. Schneider says the third should be able to receive base care.\n\n\"A G-tube really is not a hard medical device to learn how to use,\" she said.\n\nGenerally, though, military CDCs won't accept children with gastrostomy tubes. Facilities are often unable, or unwilling, to provide higher levels of care, Corbitt said.\n\nAir Force childcare programs are \"supported by a multidisciplinary team of experts who provide consultation and support to ensure the highest quality of inclusive care,\" an Air Force spokesperson told Business Insider following a query regarding the service's childcare.\n\nThe service \"offers a network of on- and off-installation care options and works closely with families to identify the appropriate setting for their child,\" said the spokesperson, adding that waitlist data helps inform future allocation requirements.\n\nStaffing shortages are another obstacle to reliable access for military personnel. Military childcare workers face unusually high attrition rates, around 50%, Warren said at last week's congressional hearing, driven largely by meager pay.\n\nCompounding the issue is the lack of a clear pathway that would allow qualified providers to move easily between states.\n\nNearly 40% of childcare workers are military spouses, said the Marine Corps' top enlisted leader, Sergeant Major Carlos Ruiz, during the hearing. \"If we can just be a little bit more smart about transferring folks and directly hiring from one CDC to another, we can reduce the attrition,\" he said.\n\nGovernment watchdogs have repeatedly flagged childcare accessibility as a point of concern for the US military. A 2024 Government Accountability Office report found that while the services focus heavily on recruiting new childcare workers, they do not consistently measure whether employee retention efforts are effective.\n\nThe military's childcare shortages aren't unique to the armed forces. Many Americans in the civilian world struggle to find reliable, reasonably priced childcare.\n\nOften, a year of childcare amounts to an entire average salary, costing tens of thousands of dollars. The cost of childcare in the US has increased by over 150% over the last quarter-century and continues to climb, often outpacing inflation. In some areas, childcare costs can exceed rent or mortgage payments.",

    "fullText": "In the search for Nancy Guthrie, authorities have relied not only on traditional investigative work but also on data trails tied to two of the world's largest companies.\n\nGoogle and Walmart have both emerged as significant players in the high-profile investigation, assisting local Arizona law enforcement and the FBI as they work to locate the 84-year-old mother of \"Today\" show host Savannah Guthrie.\n\nAuthorities believe that Nancy Guthrie was abducted from her ranch-style home in the Catalina Foothills, just outside Tucson, AZ, nearly three weeks ago.\n\nA major break in the case came more than a week into the elderly woman's mysterious disappearance, thanks, in part, to the help of Google.\n\nInitially, authorities said they were unable to retrieve any footage from Nancy Guthrie's Google-owned Nest doorbell camera because she did not have a subscription to store her video feed.\n\nThat changed when investigators, working with \"private sector partners,\" managed to cover some doorbell footage from \"residual data located in backend systems,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said in a previous statement on X.\n\nThe footage, released widely to the public by the FBI on February 10, revealed a masked and armed man outside Nancy Guthrie's home appearing to tamper with the doorbell camera on February 1, the day she vanished.\n\nIt took Google engineers several days to recover the footage, CNN has reported, citing a person familiar with the investigation. Google did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nThe tech giant is attempting to obtain additional video from Nancy Guthrie's other home cameras, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told NewsNation in a report published on Wednesday.\n\n\"We've asked Google, 'Hey guys, can you do this?' and they said the very same thing, 'Sheriff, we don't think we can get anything, but we'll try,\" Nanos said, adding that investigators remain \"hopeful.\n\nMeanwhile, authorities believe the backpack the suspect wore in the doorbell camera footage was a 25-liter \"Ozark Trail Hiker\" backpack sold exclusively at Walmart.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Pima County Sheriff's Department said this week that investigators are working with Walmart management to \"identify and isolate the individual who purchased the backpack.\"\n\nIn an interview with CBS News, Nanos described the backpack as \"one of the most promising leads\" in the case.\n\nThe sheriff said investigators have been scouring surveillance footage from local Walmart stores and that the megaretailer has turned over records of all Ozark Trail Hiker backpack purchases from the last several months, the news outlet reported.\n\nA Walmart spokesman declined to comment on the matter.\n\nSo far, the only item that has been \"positively identified\" on the suspect in the doorbell camera footage is the Ozark Trail Hiker packpack, a Pima County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman said.\n\n\"Investigators are working to determine where the other items may have been purchased,\" the spokeswoman said.\n\nNancy Guthrie's disappearance has gripped the nation. Her famous daughter, Savannah Guthrie, has issued tearful video messages, pleading for her mother's safe return.\n\nAuthorities have not publicly identified any suspects or persons of interest in the case.\n\nDNA found at Nancy Guthrie's property is being analyzed by investigators, the sheriff's department said this week.\n\nEarlier this week, Nanos, the sheriff, said the Guthrie family, including all siblings and spouses, has been cleared as possible suspects in the case.\n\n\"The family has been nothing but cooperative and gracious and are victims in this case,\" Nanos said.",

Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia.\n\nThe Udvar-Hazy Center features over 200 aircraft on display, but the Enola Gay remains one of the most prominent objects in its collection.\n\nTake a closer look at the historic aircraft.\n\nA second \"Fat Man\" atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945, by another Boeing B-29 Superfortress named Bockscar, which is on display at the National Museum of the US Air Force in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nThe emperor of Japan announced the country's surrender on August 15.\n\nTibbets commanded the Air Force's 509th Composite Group in charge of deploying nuclear weapons. The hand-picked squadron trained at an abandoned airfield in Windover, Utah.\n\nTo make the B-29 aircraft capable of carrying the atomic bomb, all of its protective and defensive armament, except for the 50-caliber tailguns, were removed to get rid of excess weight. It was also left unpainted, which saved the 850 pounds that the paint would have added.\n\nAt least 70,000 people died in the initial blast from the bombing of Hiroshima, and the death toll over five years may have exceeded 200,000 people due to the aftereffects, according to the US Department of Energy's Office of History and Heritage Resources.\n\nJapan and anti-nuclear weapons scientists released an updated higher estimate in the 1970s that counted 140,000 deaths at Hiroshima.\n\nThe Enola Gay was rattled by shockwaves from the explosion, even as it had already flown 11.5 miles away.\n\nIt took museum staff 300,000 hours to reassemble and restore the Enola Gay, with 12 truckloads transporting all of its parts.\n\nIn 1995, the fuselage and other parts of the Enola Gay were displayed at the National Air and Space Museum's flagship location in Washington, DC, in an exhibit tied to the 50th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima.\n\nThe script of the exhibit was rewritten several times as various interest groups debated how it was presented and how the decision to drop the bomb was framed, according to the Smithsonian Institution Archives.\n\nVeterans' groups pushed for the exhibit to emphasize Japanese aggression and present the narrative that dropping the atomic bomb saved lives by ending the war. Anti-war activists opposed having the exhibit justify the use of the bomb and sought to highlight its victims by protesting with alternative exhibits on the sidewalk outside the museum.\n\nWeighing 137,500 pounds with a wingspan of 141 feet, the fully assembled plane is too large for the National Air and Space Museum's flagship location on the National Mall in Washington, DC. The Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, offers more room with 340,000 square feet of exhibit space.\n\nThe Enola Gay is displayed among other aircraft from World War II, including the Northrop P-61C Black Widow, the first US aircraft designed for combat at night.\n\nOver 80 years after the bombing of Hiroshima, the Enola Gay remains not just a World War II artifact, but a symbol of a turning point that ushered the world into the nuclear age.\n\nAfter years of debate over how to present the aircraft, the permanent exhibition takes a minimalist approach, leaving visitors to decide how to understand its legacy.",

    "description": "Anxiety held me back from traveling alone for years, but I finally faced my fears with my first solo trip to Iceland. It helped build my confidence.",
    "fullText": "As I drove through Iceland's dramatic landscape alone this past June, listening to Bon Iver's \"Holocene,\" I started to cry.\n\nI was crying in sheer awe at my surroundings and the lyrics of a favorite song, one about a man pondering his significance. Most of all, though, I was crying because I was proud of myself.\n\nI had faced a fear of mine head-on, and it brought me to an emotional, yet blissful moment that I'll never forget.\n\nTaking my first solo trip showed me that what I perceived as a threat wasn't really one after all — and it gave me the confidence to continue traveling alone.\n\nTo rewind a bit, I've always been an anxious person, but it really manifested in my mid-20s when I started listening to true-crime podcasts.\n\nHuge mistake. I know too much now about what horrific acts people are capable of. My mind would conjure scenarios in which something I'd just listened to could happen to me or a loved one.\n\nThis started to impact my life in different ways — if my boyfriend was on a work trip, I was scared to leave our apartment. When my mom moved into her new home, and we didn't have an alarm system set up, I insisted I couldn't stay the night there.\n\nAnxiety had a tight grip on me at home, so the thought of solo traveling by myself? Absolutely not.\n\nThen, last January, I found myself freshly laid off, about to turn 30 in six months, with a long list of places I wanted to travel to that year.\n\nI'm not sure what changed in me — maybe it was hitting a milestone age — but after many internal battles, I decided I'd visit at least one of them solo.\n\nI settled on Iceland, which is regarded as one of the safest countries in the world. This made following through on my decision a bit easier.\n\nI also told everyone — my family, friends, even my esthetician— about my travel plans because the more people who knew, the harder it would be for me to back out.\n\nThen, I rented a campervan for three days, with a plan to explore Iceland's Ring Road.\n\nNo, I didn't return from Iceland as an entirely different person, nor did I have a transformative \"Eat, Pray, Love\" experience that changed the fabric of who I am.\n\nRather, I found that seemingly small experiences on my trip helped me build confidence and overcome so much of the anxiety I'd been struggling with.\n\nI was able to go on my first hike alone and actually enjoy myself. I drove in Iceland's notoriously high winds solo, staying calm as they shook my van.\n\nEven just being able to sleep (soundly, I might add) in my van at campsites — something I wouldn't have imagined happening a few years ago — made me feel stronger.\n\nFacing my fears head-on may have even rewired my brain a bit.\n\nAfter that three-day adventure, I booked another solo trip to Annecy, France, later that summer. I'm still looking forward to going on even more adventures by myself.\n\nIs my anxiety still there? Definitely. However, taking that trip did help me deal with it in a healthier way.\n\nAbove all, facing this fear taught me that seeing what's on the other side of my worries might actually lead me to some of life's best experiences.",

    "description": "A mom explains how everyday car rides became the most meaningful way to stay connected to her son as he entered his tween years.",
    "fullText": "When my son was still under 5, I worked at the local library. In my free time, my son was basically my best buddy. My supervisor at the time had teenagers, so she was in a different parenting stage than I was.\n\nI remember her saying that the secret to keeping her kids close was to drive them around as much as possible. This kept her kids talking to her and enabled her to maintain close relationships with them.\n\nShe was so right with her advice.\n\nMy son just turned 12, and the shift from boy to teenager seems to have happened overnight. He is becoming more independent and less talkative — with me, but not his social circle.\n\nI know it's the natural order of things for him to spread his wings and to push back a bit against me. But sometimes I just really miss my best buddy and all the fun we had spending time together when he was little. Now, when he's home from school, he's often in his room talking on the phone with his friends or playing games online with them.\n\nI think my former boss's wisdom stuck with me, because the idea of my son growing up and not wanting to talk to me scared me. I've come to realize that driving my son around whenever I get the chance is basically priceless. Right now, drives with him are primarily to and from school, but during football or basketball seasons, all of the practices and games really add up. This year, sixth grade has really felt like a turning point, because I've noticed an increase in invites to parties, hangouts, and sleepovers.\n\nI realize that as he gets older, these social outings will only increase. And then one day, when he's closer to age 16, he'll likely have a part-time job to add to his schedule. As long as he doesn't have a car, I know I'll be his main source of transportation. Instead of dreading, I know these are actually the hidden opportunities, like diamonds in the rough, to remain connected to him as he grows up.\n\nI never try to force a topic on him, because I have found that it's not the best timing for discipline-based or serious talks. I'm sure he feels trapped, so he shuts down, and it ruins the safe space I'm trying to develop out of our car rides. Allowing the conversation to flow organically is when he'll surprise me and ask me something random or open up about something that's been bothering him.\n\nEven if he doesn't open up every time, I know I'm giving him the space to do so. Often, after a few minutes of being stuck in the car together, one of us will start talking about something. I think having the music on and sightseeing on our way everywhere gives our brains distractions and talking points. It feels like the car is sometimes the white flag zone, where we stop arguing and start talking again.\n\nWhile he's mostly reserved, there are other times when he's more open and chatty, and I just let him vent and do my best to listen. It's likely therapeutic to have someone who will just listen to him at his age, but it might also be easier for him to open up to me side-by-side instead of face-to-face. Knowing there's an endpoint, such as knowing we'll be at his school in five minutes, likely helps too.\n\nWillingly taking him everywhere he needs to go daily, I think, is communicating to him that I'm not going to stop showing up for him. That no matter how tense things may be at times between us, I'm going to continue to be there for all of it.\n\nI think it reassures him that I'm not going to give up on my job as his mom, even when things get tough. I'll be sitting there in silence if that's what he needs, but the message I hope to send him is: I'm still here.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is not giving up on his tariff strategy.\n\nThe president said Saturday in a post on Truth Social that he would now impose a 15% 'worldwide tariff.'\n\n\"I, as President of the United States of America, will be, effective immediately, raising the 10% Worldwide Tariff on Countries, many of which have been 'ripping' the U.S. off for decades, without retribution (until I came along!), to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level,\" he wrote.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision on Friday, the Supreme Court said Trump did not have the authority to impose his tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a national security law that allows the president to regulate economic activity during emergencies.\n\nIn a press conference following the decision, Trump said he would use a separate authority to impose a 10% global tariff on top of any existing tariffs.\n\nThe separate authority is known as Section 122, which can only be imposed for 150 days. After that, Congress must vote to extend.\n\nA White House official later said that countries being tariffed under the authority the Supreme Court struck down will now be subject to that 10% tariff.\n\n\"With IEEPA no longer applicable, those countries will now be tariffed at the global 10% tariff using the Section 122 legal authority,\" the official said in a statement to Business Insider. \"This is, however, only temporary as the Administration will be pursuing other legal authorities to implement more appropriate or pre-negotiated tariff rates.\"\n\nThe president's Truth Social post on Saturday, while short on details, indicated he would raise that tariff to 15%.\n\nThe IEEPA-justified tariffs have been among Trump's most powerful weapons in his efforts to renegotiate trade agreements worldwide. They included Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, announced in April, which are at least 10% on nearly every country in the world.\n\n\"During the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs, which will continue our extraordinarily successful process of Making America Great Again,\" the president wrote in his Truth Social post on Saturday.",

    "description": "A mom shares what it's like raising a teenage ski athlete in the US Ski Team pipeline and the family sacrifices required along the way.",
    "fullText": "I'm the mom of an elite teenage athlete. My husband was a downhill skier as a teenager, and he taught our boys, Gavin and Deacon, to ski when they were about two or three. I don't ski at all.\n\nGavin was a shy and reserved kid, but he was a different kid on the mountain. He was so confident. We used to say that skiing was like oxygen to him. It's where he is at his best.\n\nGavin began skiing with the Bristol Mountain Freestyle team when he was around 8 years old. It's a feeder into the US Ski Team. It was apparent quickly that he was very good in the air. In 2024, when he was 14, he was invited to Lake Placid, N.Y., to participate in the US Ski Team's Project Gold, an aerial camp. He was all in on aerial skiing after that.\n\nNow 15, he is part of the US Ski Team's national development program for aerials. He trains with his national teammates at the Olympic Training Center in Lake Placid. He also travels for competitions.\n\nHe's a 15-year-old boy. He makes mistakes. But as long as he's working hard, and doing the best he can at school and being a good human, we will continue to make sacrifices for him.\n\nWe have also had conversations with Gavin about the sacrifices that he would have to make on this path. That means school is going to be harder, because he's going to miss a lot of school. He won't be able to see his school friends that much when he's competing and traveling. But, we've always told him, \"We will work hard for you as long as you are working hard for yourself.\"\n\nHe loves what he does, which makes it easy for us to support him. If he ever got to the point where he didn't want to do it anymore, we would never make him. It sounds insane considering the investment we've made, but it's his body, his life. We are also teaching him to advocate for himself because we won't always be with him.\n\nI'm a travel agent, and we like to travel as a family. Before, we'd be off to an island somewhere every break, but now I'm spending that time standing on a mountain. We've definitely had to change our plans several times for him, but we never put that burden on him. This is our family's choice.\n\nMy husband and I divide and conquer a lot. A lot of times, just my husband or just me will travel with Gavin, so that Deacon can be home, in school, and with his friends, pursuing his hobbies. Pat and I are apart a lot, but we also try to take advantage of that one-on-one time with our kids, and the moments we have together with them.\n\nDeacon is the real hero here; he is such a supportive little brother. He goes along for the ride with minimal complaints and is Gavin's biggest fan. He's so proud of him.\n\nWe want him to have fun. He had me write \"have fun\" on his skis, so if he's having a bad day or a couple of bad jumps, he can remind himself that this is fun.\n\nBut it's also serious. We might consider looking for financial sponsors soon, as we try to get him to where he needs to be. We will cross those bridges as they come. The goal is the US Ski Team for the 2034 Olympics. That sometimes feels overwhelming — it's almost a decade away.\n\nMy job as his mom is balance. I have to let go of some control, but I also need to remember that he's 15 and still needs a lot of guidance from us. I am confident in his abilities, and I'm now able to watch him jump without closing my eyes anymore.",

    "fullText": "Ireland head coach Andy Farrell said his players \"showed respect for each other and the jersey\" as he hailed Saturday's 42-21 Six Nations win over England as a \"special day\".\n\nA ravenous and resurgent Irish side scored five tries to secure their biggest away win over England and reignite their title ambitions.\n\nAnd Farrell, who was critical of his side following their 36-14 loss to France a fortnight ago, was delighted with the graft his players put in to deliver a vintage Irish display.\n\n\"It's a special day, 100% is, to come here and perform like that,\" said Farrell.\n\n\"We're delighted with that. But even more so than that for us, I thought the respect the lads showed for one another out there was immense.\n\n\"The respect they showed for the jersey and what it meant to them and respect for the Irish people really. To learn some lessons and grow as a group and a team was the overriding feeling for me.\"\n\nIreland skipper Caelan Doris, who Farrell said had his \"one of his best games in a while\", echoed the coach's comments.\n\n\"It's big,\" Doris said when asked what Saturday's display will do for Ireland's belief.\n\n\"I spoke to you guys about Paris being a reference point and hopefully we'll see a pretty steep incline in performances.\n\n\"I think this will now be a reference point that we look back on as a proper good performance that's given us a lot of belief.\n\n\"It was an unbelievable atmosphere out there. You talk about inspiring the nation and getting the Irish people behind us... Hopefully that brought people here and back at home a bit of joy today.\"\n\nRuthless Ireland hit record away win over England\n\n'We have let everyone down' - Genge after England thrashed by Ireland\n\nFarrell, who has come under increasing pressure after defeats by New Zealand, South Africa and France since he returned from the British and Irish Lions tour, said he was thrilled with how his players \"got out of their own way\".\n\nHe also pinpointed Stuart McCloskey chasing down Marcus Smith in the closing stages of the game as a telling indicator of his side's hunger.\n\n\"What that accumulated to was some fantastic rugby that was broken-field stuff,\" added Farrell.\n\n\"We got them on the break, made line-breaks from deep within our own half and ground it out on their line.\n\n\"The telling parts of Stu McCloskey chasing Marcus back and being able to put him in touch just shows the fight and the Rob Baloucoune one [turnover] on the far side shows the fight and the spirit these lads have got for one another and what it means to them.\"\n\nWhen asked if Ireland simply wanted it more than England, who were already wounded from last week's defeat by Scotland at Murrayfield, Farrell said: \"It looked like we were hunting people down throughout the game.\n\n\"It's one thing getting a good start and getting the bonus point but how we kick-chased, how we kept hunting down the breakdown... All that type of stuff shows that that's a proper performance where there's no egos.\"",

    "fullText": "The noise is one of the first things that hits you on arrival in India.\n\nThe chatter. The beeping of horns. A thrilling assault on the senses.\n\nEngland have also battled to dampen the noise around their group throughout this T20 World Cup campaign.\n\nShould Brendon McCullum stay on as coach? Is Harry Brook the right man to be captain?\n\nEven after reaching the relative tranquillity of central Sri Lanka, Brook fielded questions about the ongoing situation regarding Pakistan players' involvement in The Hundred.\n\nBrook's pre-prepared answers – he gave it in two separate interviews to different questions – did not say much, but he did at least show support for those involved.\n\nOn another day, Brook's admission that England had \"probably underestimated a couple of the sides\" when scraping through the group stage would have taken the headlines.\n\nIt was honest, but not a great look for a team battling a perception of being loose with their preparation.\n\n\"We obviously didn't know all the players and we had minimal stats on some of them,\" Brook said.\n\n\"That's something that we can definitely improve on in the future, especially in tournaments further down the line - getting your homework done a little bit earlier.\"\n\nEngland's performance in the group stage was undoubtedly unconvincing.\n\nThey were taken to the final ball by Nepal and lost to West Indies in Mumbai, before edging to wins over Italy and Scotland in Kolkata.\n\nBatters got in and got out - Tom Banton's 63 not out the only real match-defining score. Even the ever-reliable Adil Rashid has gone for nine runs per over or \n\nIt means England have shown little to suggest they can threaten late into the tournament to this point.\n\nWithout improvement this will likely be a fourth underwhelming major tournament in a row since they won the T20 World Cup in 2022.\n\nBut Brook's comments also reflect some of the difficulties faced by the major nations at this World Cup – a tournament in which no team has built an entirely compelling case to suggest they will be champions.\n\nPlayers from the lower-ranked teams expressed their keenness to perform, not just to cause an upset but also to prove they are deserving of the greater opportunities they so desperately seek.\n\nThe Test-playing sides, in contrast, had everything to lose. Just ask Mitchell Marsh when he gets off his flight to back to Australia on Saturday.\n\nAnd for all their struggles to finish matches with ease, England were also ahead in all three games against their lower-ranked opponents.\n\nNepal's chase looked to have stalled, Scotland were 127-8 and Italy 1-2 in the first over of their chase.\n\nMost former England captains would not admit it, and maybe Brook has shown he would, but it would only be human to relax in those situations.\n\nMost of all, however, England are hoping familiarity brings an upturn in fortunes.\n\nThey returned to Sri Lanka on Tuesday, first spending two nights in Colombo before taking the winding drive to Pallekele.\n\nColombo was where Brook stood in front of his team-mates in late January and apologised for his late-night antics in Wellington and the subsequent fallout – an attempt to draw a line under the Ashes defeat.\n\nPallekele was where England won all three T20s against the very same team they now face.\n\nEngland said they were badly prepared for the Ashes and now admit to being underprepared for this group stage. For the next task they could hardly have had better preparation.\n\n\"It's just about reading the pitch and the conditions as quickly as possible and communication's key,\" said Brook, when asked what he learned from beating Sri Lanka.\n\n\"We obviously had that last game where we only got 130, but that ended up being a winning score.\n\n\"You never quite know what's going to happen with the pitch and until you end up playing on it.\"\n\nThe 3-0 win, which concluded less than three weeks ago, took England's winning run in T20s against Sri Lanka to 11.\n\nThere have been six UK prime ministers since England last lost to Sunday's opponents in the shortest format.\n\nSri Lanka's key bowlers Wanindu Hasaranga and Matheesha Pathirana have also been ruled out with injury.\n\nAnd after Sri Lanka, England will face Pakistan before a meeting with New Zealand.\n\nThey have won their past three T20 series against Pakistan and beat the Black Caps last year. That was a rain-hit contest but in the one match completed, England racked up 236-4.\n\nThe favourable draw, set by the pre-seedings that have sent the four group winners into the other side of the Super 8 draw, means there will be no excuses should England fail to progress to the semi-finals.\n\nThat was the minimum requirement before this tournament began and relief at avoiding a group-stage exit should not hide that fact.\n\nEngland and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chief executive Richard Gould arrived in Sri Lanka on Saturday, with managing director Rob Key to follow on Sunday.\n\nIt is described as a pre-planned trip rather than anything that should ramp up the pressure on coach Brendon McCullum, whose future remains in question after the Ashes debacle.\n\nThese may be three matches for McCullum to save his job – should he want to continue into the summer. Two wins would likely be enough to take England into the semi-finals.\n\nAnything less and that noise would only ramp up again.\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.\n\nIs Buttler's form a worry?

The last six months I've been playing some really good tennis,\" she said.\n\n\"I made seven consecutive semi-finals and I was like, 'You know what, a title would be nice, maybe it will happen this week', and it did.\"\n\nPegula also admitted she \"couldn't have asked for a better birthday present\", with the world number five set to turn 32 on 24 February.\n\nSvitolina came into the match perhaps feeling the after-effects of beating Coco Gauff the previous day in an epic three-hour encounter, as Pegula took control immediately.\n\nPegula sped into an early double break, and despite some resistance from Svitolina, went on to wrap up the first set as the Ukrainian went into the net.\n\nIn the second set, Pegula's deep, angled hitting continued to force Svitolina, who triumphed in Dubai in 2017 and 2018, into mistakes.\n\nSvitolina saved one championship point on serve, but was powerless to prevent defeat in the next game as Pegula sealed the title with an ace.\n\nThe win saw Pegula become the third American to win in Dubai after Lindsay Davenport and three-time champion Venus Williams.\n\nLive scores, results and order of play\n\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Team GB face an uphill task to win an Olympic medal in the four-man bobsleigh as they sit seventh at the halfway point in a race where three teams crashed.\n\nPilot Brad Hall had showcased why the British team are medal contenders in Cortina with a brilliant first run of 54.39 seconds, which placed them third.\n\nBut he was left looking stunned and emotional after they dropped off the pace in the second, losing four places in the standings.\n\nThey now sit 0.23secs off the bronze medal position before Sunday's podium-deciding heats.\n\n\"I'm a bit lost for words to be honest,\" Hall told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We had a really good first run and the second run just got away from us and I honestly don't really know where. It felt like a nice run to me but we bled some time.\"\n\nThe three German teams remain the ones to beat and they occupy the top three spots with Johannes Lochner, who won two-man gold earlier this week, leading the charge with an overall time of 1:48:61.\n\nThere was a long delay to competition at the Cortina sliding track after Austria suffered a crash during heat two, with one of the athletes treated for a lengthy period on the ice before being stretchered off.\n\nGB's Greg Crackett said Austrian pilot Jakob Mandlbauer had gone to hospital but was moving and \"seemed to be alright\".\n\nAction resumed after about a 20-minute delay but, with the track now slower because of the rising temperature, the British team were unable to find the speed of their first run and currently sit on 1:49:43.\n\nFrance and Trinidad and Tobago, piloted by Harrogate-born Axel Brown, also suffered crashes but both crews walked away from the sleds.\n\nHall finished 12th in the two-man earlier this week, but said he is targeting a first medal in 12 years with his four-man team.\n\nTeam Hall finished sixth four years ago in Beijing and the last Olympic cycle has been a fruitful one.\n\nHall is the most successful British men's pilot in World Cup history with 30 race medals, and guided his team to a first world championship medal since 1939 when they took silver in Switzerland in 2023.\n\nThat came after a first-ever European title in Altenberg earlier that year.\n\nFollowing that success, the sport received a boost in funding from UK Sport, having been cut in 2019 following poor results at Pyeongchang 2018.\n\nTraining in Cortina has not been perfect, with the team clocking times outside the top five on five of the six runs.\n\nThings looked promising after run one and the team fist-pumped and banged the sled in celebration as they came up the finish straight.\n\nBut mistakes in run two proved costly and their time of 55.04secs was only the 12th-quickest in run two, leaving medal hopes hanging by a thread.\n\nTeam GB have not won an Olympic bobsleigh medal since Sochi 12 years ago, where the four-man team won bronze.\n\nMeanwhile, the medal-deciding runs for the two-woman event take place later on Saturday, with Team GB's Adele Nicoll and Ashleigh Nelson 21st at the halfway point.\n\nAfter yet another day of heavy snowfall in Livigno, the women's freeski halfpipe final - featuring Team GB's Zoe Atkin - has been postponed until Sunday.\n\nThe final was due to get under way at 18:30 GMT and was initially delayed until 20:00.\n\nBut because of \"persistent heavy snow and the inability to prepare the pipe in a safe and fair condition\", the decision was quickly made to postpone.\n\nAtkin, the current halfpipe world champion, qualified top for the final with a best score of 91.50 on her first run.\n\nThe 23-year-old, a two-time X Games gold medallist, is the younger sister of Izzy Atkin, who won Great Britain's first Olympic medal on skis with her slopestyle bronze in 2018.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo, Norway's king of cross-country skiing, broke the record for the most gold medals won at a single Winter Olympics with his sixth of the Games.\n\nKlaebo led a Norwegian sweep of the podium in the 50km mass start classic, with team-mates Martin Loewstroem Nyenget and Emil Iversen taking silver and bronze respectively.\n\nThe 29-year-old finished the brutal distance in two hours six minutes 44.8 seconds, 8.9secs ahead of Nyenget who takes his third medal of the Games.\n\n\"It's been crazy, it's a dream come true,\" Klaebo told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I really think this Olympics has been perfect. Being able to crown the Olympics with the 50km was unbelievable.\"\n\nKlaebo breaks the previous record of five golds from a single Games, held by American speed skater Eric Heiden since the Lake Placid Olympics of 1980.\n\nIt also extends his own record for most Winter Olympic golds to 11, while he becomes the first athlete to win all six cross-country events at one Games.\n\nOnly US swimming great Michael Phelps, who won 23 gold medals, has more Olympic titles to his name.\n\nBorn in Oslo, Klaebo moved to Trondheim - a haven of cross-country skiing trails - as a young child, a move that has seen him become the greatest to ever do the sport.\n\nNo other man, active or retired, comes close to his record of 116 World Cup wins, while he is also a 15-time world champion, winning all six titles at last year's edition on home snow in Trondheim.\n\n\"After the world championships last year, we knew that it was possible, but to be able to do it, it's hard to find the right words,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"[There were] so many emotions when I'm crossing the finish line.\"\n\nHis sixth Olympic gold at Milan-Cortina adds to the titles he had won earlier in the Games in the skiathlon, sprint classic, 10km interval start free, 4x7.5km relay and the team sprint.\n\nElsewhere in the race, Team GB's Andrew Musgrave placed sixth, almost four minutes behind Klaebo's winning time, while team-mate Joe Davies was 16th.\n\nMusgrave, 35, is appearing at his fifth Olympics - but did not rule out a sixth in four years' time.\n\n\"I'm still young and promising,\" Musgrave joked to BBC Sport.\n\n\"It was a decent Games. I came in good shape, but not quite good enough to fight the Norwegians, they're just so dominant at the moment.\"\n\nIt marks the end of a remarkable Olympics for Great Britain's cross-country team, in which Musgrave and James Clugnet recorded a fifth-place finish in the team sprint event, the nation's best Olympic result in the sport.\n\nThat bettered Musgrave's sixth in the 10km interval start freestyle, while Anna Pryce recorded a best British women's result at an Olympics with her 32nd place in the sprint classic.\n\n\"We've had the best ever women's Olympic result, best ever men's Olympic result, best ever team result.\n\n\"Joe is still young and up and coming, he's doing super good, fighting for top 10s, so the whole team is just showing that we work well together, we've got a good programme.\n\n\"We've had limited resources but we can still show that we can do good results.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Tries: Dingwall, Lawrence, Underhill Cons: Ford 3\n\nTries: Gibson-Park, Baloucoune, O'Brien, Sheehan, Osborne Cons: Crowley 4 Pens: Crowley 3\n\nA ruthless Ireland reignited their Six Nations title bid with a record 42-21 away win over England at Allianz Stadium.\n\nThe visitors, whose previous record-winning margin was a 17-point victory in 2022, ran in five tries to embarrass Steve Borthwick's side.\n\nEngland's defeat - their third heaviest at home - leaves their championship hopes in tatters after two defeats and one win, with away games against Italy and France to come.\n\nAndy Farrell's Ireland proved too quick and slick for the hosts, scoring three tries inside the opening 30 minutes.\n\nEngland's home form under Borthwick had become formidable, but the run ended at nine consecutive victories after a miserable afternoon that was meant to be a celebration of captain Maro Itoje's 100th cap.\n\nLack of discipline, missed tackles and simple errors were consistently punished, with 22 points the fourth-most first-half points conceded by England at home.\n\nJamison Gibson-Park's quick thinking caught England napping, before tries by wingers Robert Baloucoune and Tommy O'Brien.\n\nBorthwick's side, who were looking to bounce back from last week's defeat by Scotland, finally crossed at the end of a frantic first half through Fraser Dingwall.\n\nIreland could still claim the Triple Crown, which they won last year, with Dan Sheehan's try clinching the bonus point early in the second half.\n\nThe visitors are still in the running for the championship but may rue not picking up a late bonus point in last week's win over Italy.\n\nCentre Ollie Lawrence and Sam Underhill scored second-half tries for England, but Ireland were always too far clear because of the boot of Jack Crowley and a try by Jamie Osborne.\n\nReaction, analysis and live text as Ireland thrash England\n\nIn the opening two rounds, Ireland were a long way off the side that claimed back-to-back titles in 2023 and 2024.\n\nWith key personnel injured and players lacking form, Farrell's team has a new look this championship.\n\nAnd against England, Ireland's multi-phase attack looked back at its best.\n\nOne player to benefit is Ulster wing Baloucoune, who was a standout performer against Italy last week - his acceleration and offload creating the initial break for Gibson-Park's try.\n\nHis club team-mate Stuart McCloskey then burst up the middle of the pitch for Baloucoune to eventually dot down in the corner.\n\nFull of confidence, Baloucoune - who was also excellent in defence - broke clear and found replacement O'Brien, on for injured James Lowe, for a third unanswered try.\n\nMuch of the build-up to the game at Allianz Stadium once again was dominated by the Ireland number 10 debate.\n\nCrowley's performance could well end it - for a while, at least - as he guided his side around the pitch brilliantly.\n\nBut his poor missed touch-finder against Italy, with the clock in the red and a bonus point a real possibility, may prove costly if France slip up.\n\nYet the game could mirror the 2021 win over England, which sparked Ireland's first rejuvenation under Farrell before they reached world number one in 2023.\n\nThis was their sixth win over England in their past seven meetings.\n\nEngland lacked energy and dynamism in the early exchanges against Scotland, trailing 17-0 after 15 minutes.\n\nThe inclusion of Henry Pollock and Tom Curry from the off against Ireland was meant to be the fix, but the same problems were evident.\n\nBorthwick's side, who lost their 12-game winning run in Edinburgh, were unable to deal with the speed and intensity of Ireland's attack, and they once again came off second best in the air.\n\nThe hosts did have opportunities to score in the first half but lacked any sort of clinical edge.\n\nJamie George coming on for a misfiring Luke Cowan-Dickie and Marcus Smith replacing full-back Freddie Steward, who spent time in the sin-bin, before half-time summed up Borthwick's frustration.\n\nLosing scrum-half Alex Mitchell early in the game also did not help in dealing with the first-half chaos.\n\nSmith showed some sharp touches and was the player to send over Dingwall right on half-time.\n\nCaelan Doris' break at the start of the second half and subsequent yellow card for Pollock, which was followed by Sheehan's try, quickly ended any chances of a dramatic comeback.\n\nHopes of a Grand Slam or a first title since 2020 could not be further away and given tricky trips to Rome and Paris are to come, Borthwick's side are now under increasing pressure.\n\nEngland: Steward; Freeman, Lawrence, Dingwall, Arundell; Ford, Mitchell; Genge, Cowan-Dickie, Heyes, Itoje, Chessum, T Curry, Earl, Pollock\n\nReplacements: George, Rodd, Davison, Coles, Pepper, Underhill, Van Poortvliet, M Smith\n\nIreland: Osborne;

    "fullText": "LONDON (AP) — Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the U.K. and its European allies should immediately deploy noncombat troops to Ukraine to show Russian President Vladimir Putin that Western nations are truly committed to the nation’s freedom and independence.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Johnson told the BBC that the troops should be sent to peaceful regions in non-fighting roles. The comments from Johnson, who was one of Ukraine’s staunchest supporters as Britain’s leader during the first months of the conflict, were contained in excerpts of an interview that will be broadcast on Sunday.\n\nIf adopted, the proposal from Johnson would mark a major policy shift for the U.K. and its allies. While the “coalition of the willing” is working on plans to send troops to Ukraine, such a deployment would only take place after an agreement to end the fighting and would be designed to police the ceasefire.\n\n“If we are willing to do it in the context of a ceasefire, which of course puts all the initiative, all the power, in Putin’s hands, why not do it now?’’ Johnson said. “There is no logical reason that I can see why we shouldn’t send peaceful ground forces there to show our support, our constitutional support for a free, independent Ukraine.”\n\nWestern military planners have avoided discussing such a move publicly out of concern that Russia would see it as an escalation of the conflict.\n\nPutin in September rejected Western proposals for a peacekeeping force in Ukraine, saying that any troops deployed to the country would be “legitimate targets.”\n\nBut Johnson said Putin shouldn’t be able to dictate terms to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n“It’s about whether Ukraine is a free country or not,” he said. “If it’s a vassal state of Russia, which is what Putin wants, then obviously it’s up to Putin to decide who comes to his country. If it’s not, then it’s up to the Ukrainians.”\n\nWhen asked about Johnson’s comments, Britain’s Ministry of Defense said the government was continuing to work with the coalition of the willing to prepare for the deployment of troops to Ukraine after a ceasefire.\n\n“The multinational force Ukraine under UK leadership will secure peace for the long term, with the Prime Minister being clear that we will put British troops on the ground following the end of hostilities,” the ministry said in a statement.\n\nJohnson said the war in Ukraine was the result of the West’s failure to support Ukraine after the invasion of Crimea in 2014, as well as its inability to punish Bashar al-Assad for using chemical weapons against his own people in Syria and the debacle of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\n“I think Putin was emboldened by a Western failure in Syria to punish Assad for using chemical weapons,” he said.\n\n“I think Putin was further emboldened in February 2022 by what he’d seen in Afghanistan, and a sort of general sense that the West was on the back foot. He’d seen those appalling pictures of Americans being forced to flee Afghanistan and the UK pulling out as well, and that really did embolden him.”",

    "fullText": "Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed chair of the FCC, wants TV broadcasters to rally around the American flag in celebration of the U.S.’s 250th anniversary this year — suggesting that, for example, local stations could start “each broadcast day” with “The Star-Spangled Banner” or Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nOn Friday, Carr announced the Pledge America Campaign, which he framed as part of the White House’s Salute to America 250 Task Force agenda, which “invites citizens to have a renewed love of American history, experience the beauty of our country, and ignite a spirit of adventure and innovation that will raise our nation to new heights over the next 250 years.”\n\nBrendan Carr Confirms FCC Has Begun 'Enforcement Proceedings' Against ABC's 'The View' Over Equal Time Issues\n\nCBS 'Censorship' of Stephen Colbert Slammed by Democratic FCC Commissioner as Latest 'Corporate Capitulation' to Trump Administration\n\nFCC Chairman Says There Are 'Legitimate Competition Concerns' With Netflix's Warner Bros. Deal - but His Agency Has No Authority to Review It\n\nAccording to the FCC, Carr is “heeding this call” put forth by the Trump White House with the Pledge America Campaign, which “enables broadcasters to lend their voices in support of Task Force 250 and the celebration of America’s 250th birthday by airing patriotic, pro-America content that celebrates the American journey and inspires its citizens by highlighting the historic accomplishments of this great nation from our founding through the Trump Administration today.”\n\nThe agency’s announcement comes as Carr has said he wants to help local TV stations push back against national networks on the amount reverse compensation that they pay for programming.\n\nCarr also has taken an aggressive stance in applying the FCC’s rules to fight against what he sees as pro-left bias in some national network programming. That has included his threat to investigate local broadcasters for “news distortion” if they aired “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Carr also has said the FCC “equal time” rule for political candidates will apply to daytime and late-night shows that are deemed to not be “bona fide” news programs. The FCC is investigating ABC’s “The View” for a possible violation of the equal-time rule after Texas politician James Talarico, who is running for the U.S. Senate, appeared on the show. This past Monday, Stephen Colbert said CBS lawyers blocked “The Late Show” from airing his interview with Talarico over concern that it would trigger the FCC equal-time rule.\n\nCarr, in a statement Friday, said, “The White House is leading our national celebration of this historic event with the Salute to America 250 Task Force, which calls on the federal government, among others, to mark this momentous occasion. As part of this effort, I am calling on broadcasters to pledge to provide programming that promotes civic education, national pride and our shared history.”\n\nCarr continued, “This type of programming is more relevant than ever, as surveys show that civics education is in rapid decline. And classic programming such as ‘Schoolhouse Rock!’ is now only found in online archives. Broadcasters are uniquely positioned to help address these concerning developments by providing programming that celebrates the remarkable story of American Independence while also tailoring it to the specific needs of their local communities, in furtherance of their public interest obligations.”\n\nThe FCC’s GOP chairman also provided examples of “nonpartisan” celebratory pro-American programming:\n\nRunning PSAs, short segments or full specials specifically promoting civic education, inspiring local stories, and American history\n\nIncluding segments during regular news programming that highlight local sites that are significant to American and regional history, such as National Park Service sites\n\nStarting each broadcast day with “The Star-Spangled Banner” or Pledge of Allegiance\n\nAiring music by America’s greatest composers, such as John Philip Sousa, Aaron Copland, Duke Ellington or George Gershwin\n\nProviding daily “Today in American History” announcements highlighting significant events that took place on that day in history\n\nPartnering with community organizations and other groups that are already working hard to bring America’s stories of unity, perseverance, and triumph to light\n\n'Goat' Cast Guide: All the Celebrities and NBA Stars Voicing Animals in the Basketball Movie\n\nOscars: Original Screenplay — 'Sinners,' 'Sentimental Value' and 'Blue Moon' Gain More Popularity Among Voters\n\nWhat’s Coming to Netflix in February 2026",

    "description": "The President’s Day weekend excursion, including a group of moms, wives and close friends who shared a passion for skiing the untracked powder of the hushed, untamed wilderness of California’s Sierra ...",
    "fullText": "The eight friends found joy in the mountains, skiing together across the untracked powder of the hushed, pristine wilderness of California’s Sierra Nevada – their close friendship standing out against a rugged, unforgiving terrain.\n\nThe trip had been planned well in advance: A three-day expedition that began at Frog Lake Backcountry Huts – a hard-to-reach but cozy oasis 7,600 feet high in the Tahoe National Forest area, accessible only by ski, snowboard or snowshoe.\n\nThe group – mothers, wives and passionate, skilled skiers – came from different parts of the country for a professionally guided backcountry tour over President’s Day weekend. With four guides and three other people accompanying them, they glided on skis near the frozen lake and snow-capped cliffs, under the shadow of a ridge dotted with red firs and Jeffrey pines.\n\nThe biggest winter storm of the new year loomed over the picturesque mountains, meanwhile, as dire warnings from forecasters echoed on social media.\n\nIt was the last day of a perilous backcountry odyssey. And, as predicted, the blizzard arrived, delivering blankets of unstable powder. They were headed home when the fresh snow, light and soft, suddenly descended from the slopes as one of the most ferocious forces of nature.\n\n“Avalanche!” one of them yelled.\n\nWithin seconds, a tsunami of ice, snow and debris the size of a football field careened downhill around them, thick enough to nearly bury a house, authorities said, citing the accounts of survivors.\n\n“It overtook them rather quickly,” Nevada County Sheriff’s Capt. Rusty Greene later told reporters.\n\nThe first call for help was a silent text message from an emergency beacon, mobilizing a small army of rescuers dispatched from different directions.\n\n“Medical for avalanche in the area of Castle Peak,” a voice on a fire department dispatch channel said at 10:45 a.m. Tuesday.\n\n“Nine to ten people buried, three others attempting to dig them out,” someone said in the audio as emergency responders were heard coordinating search and rescue efforts, noting no air support was available because of the storm.\n\nAn hours-long fight for survival was beginning. Some members of the group dug desperately into the snow for friends and partners as the powder began to turn into a freezing, concrete-like crust.\n\nSix of the close friends and three guides are among the nine people killed or presumed dead in the avalanche near California’s Lake Tahoe - the nation’s deadliest in 45 years. Six skiers survived and were rescued.\n\nSisters Liz Clabaugh and Caroline Sekar were among the dead. The others were identified by their families as Carrie Atkin, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse and Kate Vitt. A spouse of a Tahoe Nordic Search and Rescue team member – who responded to the disaster – was also among those killed.\n\nThe families of the six women who perished said in a statement that they still have “many unanswered questions.” The sheriff’s office said it is investigating whether criminal negligence contributed to the incident.\n\n“We are devastated beyond words,” the families said. “Our focus right now is supporting our children through this incredible tragedy and honoring the lives of these extraordinary women.”\n\nThe families asked for privacy as they grieve a “sudden and profound loss.” The friends – from Idaho, the Bay Area and the nearby Truckee-Tahoe region – were “passionate, skilled skiers who cherished time together in the mountains.” They had trained for the backcountry, trusted their guides and carried and were familiar with avalanche safety equipment, according to the statement.\n\nThe bodies of the eight dead skiers remain on the icy mountainside because of the treacherous conditions, the sheriff’s department said. One other person is unaccounted for and presumed dead, according to Moon.\n\n“We are heartbroken and are doing our best to care for one another and our families in the way we know these women would have wanted,” the families said.\n\nOnly two members of the friends’ group survived, as well as a guide and two other skiers on the tour.\n\nIn the end, one man and five women made it out, taking cover for hours under a tarp – “doing everything they can” until rescuers on snowcats and skies could reach them, according to Greene.\n\nRescuers trudged through the heavy snow, combatting gale force winds under white-out conditions and mindful that another avalanche could potentially barrel down from above, Sheriff Moon said.\n\nRescuers were 2 miles from the skiers when their machinery got stuck, forcing them to ski the rest of the way until they reached the avalanche site around 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, the sheriff said. The survivors used avalanche beacons and iPhone Emergency SOS via satellite to text emergency services.\n\nAn emergency official communicated with a guide for more than four hours, relaying critical information to sheriff’s deputies, according to Don O’Keefe, chief of law enforcement at California’s Office of Emergency Services.\n\nBuried in an avalanche, few people are able to dig themselves out, according to experts. Within minutes, breathing creates an ice mask around the face. The snow eventually hardens like a concrete entombment.\n\nIf pulled out within 15 minutes, the Utah Avalanche Center says, 93% of avalanche victims live. After 45 minutes, only 20% to 30% survive. Few make it after two hours under the snow.\n\nSurvivors assemble tent-pole-like probes and stick them into the snow in hopes of striking buried skiers, according to experts.\n\nThat Tuesday morning, they frantically poked through the hardening snow for their ski partners and friends. Eventually they dug out three people who were no longer alive, the sheriff said.\n\n“Uncovering people who are deceased, that they know and probably cared about, is just horrible,” Nevada County Undersheriff Sam Brown told CBS News.\n\nKurt Gensheimer was on a three-night trip at Frog Lake Backcountry Huts and left Sunday, just hours before the moms and the other skiers arrived. They never crossed paths.\n\nHe had been there four times in the last four years and understood the pull of the dangerous yet beautiful surroundings.\n\n“It’s a magical place,” Gensheimer told CNN affiliate KCRA. “It’s one of the best places to backcountry ski in the country and Frog Lake Huts are the nicest amenities, possibly in North America, for backcountry skiing.”\n\nHe considered the huts a safe place to ride out a storm but his group decided to leave before the blizzard.\n\n“The discussion in the huts was, this is a big storm coming… It’s going to be falling blizzard conditions. You either should get out by Monday or plan to be there till Thursday, Friday,” Gensheimer said.\n\nThe tour company that organized the ill-fated trip, Blackbird Mountain Guides, said the tour leaders were highly trained and certified in avalanche education.\n\nIt was also aware of the avalanche danger.\n\nOn Sunday morning, the same day the group embarked on their journey, the company warned on Facebook of a big snow storm approaching and urged skiers to monitor to the Sierra Avalanche Center and “use extra caution this week!”\n\nThat morning, the Sierra Avalanche Center issued an avalanche watch that was elevated to a warning at 5 a.m. on Tuesday: “HIGH avalanche danger exists in the backcountry.\n\nThe most dangerous time for avalanches is after a rapid snowfall, according to experts. Tuesday’s avalanche was classified as a D2.5 on a five-level scale that measures the destructive potential of moving debris, according to Moon.\n\nThe allure of backcountry skiing endures despite the risks.\n\nNate Greenberg, who lives in the Eastern Sierra Mountains and said he survived an avalanche in 2021, advised against rushing to judgment. Backcountry skiing, he said, involves multiple “micro decisions.”\n\nIan McCammon, an engineer and avalanche researcher, also stressed the difficult decision making process on the slopes.\n\n“There’s usually a lot more than meets the eye to those accidents,” McCammon told CNN. “Once you start getting into the specifics, you start understanding. It’s easy to say that the people are foolish, or it’s easy to say that people have taken a lot of risks, but sometimes they’re in situations where it’s not obvious to see how they came to the decision that they did.”\n\nSara Boilen, a clinical psychologist and backcountry skier in Montana who specializes on human factors in avalanche terrain, said: “We’re all desperate to understand what happened.”\n\n“As a researcher, I want to understand so that we can deepen our sense of what is hard about decision making in the backcountry,” she told CNN. “As an educator, I want to understand so I can help others learn. As a backcountry user, I want to strengthen my own decision making by learning from others. And as a human I want answers - how could something like this happen? And we may never get all of the answers. That’s the thing about a wicked learning environment.”\n\nShe added, “Imagine losing somebody you love and simultaneously losing the relationship you have to the place you go to feel better. So, when you lose somebody in an avalanche and the mountains are the place that you feel most whole, most alive, it’s where you go for healing, what do you do?”\n\nCNN’s Nouran Salahieh, Elizabeth Wolfe, Chris Boyette, Cindy Von Quednow, Alisha Ebrahimji, Chris Dolce, Mary Gilbert, Martin Goillandeau, Chimaine Pouteau, Stephanie Elam, Diego Mendoza, Karina Tsui, Danya Gainor, Briana Waxman, Andi Babineau and Brad Parks contributed to this report.",

    "description": "In TODAY.com's Expert Tip of the Day, a longevity researcher shares the top fruit to promote a healthy heart and brain as we age.",
    "fullText": "When it comes to longevity, what we eat every day plays a major role. Diet is has the potential to promote healthy aging and extend our \"healthspan,\" or the number of years spent living in good health.\n\nBut the average healthspan in the United States is shrinking. More than three quarters of Americans have at least one chronic disease, such as heart disease, cancer or diabetes — a significant increase from the decade prior.\n\nThere's growing evidence that eating more nutritious, plant-based foods and limiting less healthy, processed foods can help prevent of chronic diseases and promote healthy aging, Emily Johnston, Ph.D., a research professor at NYU Langone specializing in longevity and nutrition, tells TODAY.com.\n\nFresh fruits and vegetables are a “non-negotiable\" to live a longer, healthier life, she says.\n\nJohnston previously shared the top fruits to support longevity, but one in particular reigns supreme for its beneficial nutrients.\n\nBerries are the best fruit to eat for healthy aging, according to Johnston. \"I always prioritize berries, every single day,\" she says.\n\nBlueberries, raspberries, strawberries and blackberries are all excellent choices.\n\nBlueberries often top the list of healthiest berries due to their high antioxidant content, but you can't go wrong with any berry, says Johnston.\n\nThese small but mighty superfoods are packed with beneficial nutrients, including fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.\n\nThe gut-healthy fiber in berries is a star nutrient for healthy aging. Fiber can aid with digestion, stabilize blood sugar, lower cholesterol, and reduce the risk of heart disease and colon cancer, which is on the rise.\n\nBerries are especially rich in phytochemicals, like flavonoids, which have potent anti-inflammatory effects in the body and help protect heart and brain health. There's evidence that eating berries regularly in mid-life can improve cognitive function and lower dementia risk.\n\nMost berries contain immune-boosting vitamin C and vitamin K, which supports healthy blood clotting, along with essential minerals like potassium and magnesium.\n\nBerries also provide sweetness thanks to their natural sugars, making them an excellent alternative to added sugar, which most Americans eat too much of, per the American Heart Association.\n\nBerries are versatile, delicious and easy to sprinkle into your diet. Johnston recommends eating a variety of berries (and all fruits) daily to get a range of beneficial nutrients.\n\nAim to eat at least five servings a day of fruit and vegetables, along with lean proteins, healthy fats and whole grains.\n\nEnjoy berries for breakfast on top of yogurt or oatmeal, blended into smoothies, sprinkled onto salads, as a snack, or as a naturally sweet dessert.\n\nTODAY’s Expert Tip of the Day series is all about simple strategies to make life a little easier. Every Monday through Friday, different qualified experts share their best advice on diet, fitness, heart health, mental wellness and more.\n\nThis article was originally published on TODAY.com",

    "fullText": "The Department of Labor’s (DOL) headquarters banned Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer’s husband after two women employed by the department alleged that he sexually assaulted them, The New York Times reported Thursday.\n\nThe staffers claimed that Dr. Shawn DeRemer touched them inappropriately inside the department building, with one of the incidents caught on security camera on Dec. 18, people familiar with the incident told the Times. The video shows DeRemer giving a woman an extended embrace, which was reviewed as part of a criminal investigation.\n\nAnother person told the newspaper the incidents were brought up during the DOL’s Office of Inspector General’s investigation into alleged misconduct between Chavez-DeRemer and two of her top staffers.\n\nThe Times obtained a Metropolitan Police Department report filed last month about forced sexual contact at the Labor Department building. The department’s sexual assault unit is investigating the incident.\n\nAfter DeRemer was barred from the building, a building restriction notice viewed by the Times read, “If Mr. DeRemer attempts to enter, he is to be asked to leave.”\n\nThe Hill has reached out to the DOL for comment.\n\nThe two staffers investigated for alleged misconduct, Chavez-DeRemer’s chief of staff Jihun Han and his deputy Rebecca Wright, were reportedly placed on leave amid the investigation into claims of personal trips with family and friends paid for with taxpayer dollars, the New York Post and Politico reported. Chavez-DeRemer was also accused of having an affair with a subordinate and drinking on the job, the outlets wrote.\n\n“There’s not an ounce of truth to this, and anyone who knows my wife would know that,” DeRemer said in a statement, the Post reported.\n\nThe DOL and White House also denied the allegations against Chavez-DeRemer. A DOL spokesperson told the Post that the “unsubstantiated allegations are categorically false.”",

    "description": "The Pentagon and the Energy Department for the first time airlifted a small nuclear reactor from California to Utah, demonstrating what they say is the U.S. potential to quickly deploy nuclear power f...",
    "fullText": "HILL AIR FORCE BASE, Utah (AP) — The Pentagon and the Energy Department for the first time airlifted a small nuclear reactor from California to Utah, demonstrating what they say is the U.S. potential to quickly deploy nuclear power for military and civilian use.\n\nThe nearly 700-mile flight last weekend — which transported a 5-megawatt microreactor without nuclear fuel — highlights the Trump administration’s drive to promote nuclear energy to help meet skyrocketing demand for power from artificial intelligence and data centers, as well as for use by the military.\n\nEnergy Secretary Chris Wright and Undersecretary of Defense Michael Duffey, who traveled with the privately built reactor, hailed the Feb. 15 trip on a C-17 military aircraft as a breakthrough for U.S. efforts to fast-track commercial licensing for the microreactors, part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to reshape the country's energy landscape.\n\nPresident Donald Trump supports nuclear power — a carbon-free source of electricity — as a reliable energy source, even as he has been broadly hostile to renewable energy and prioritizes coal and other fossil fuels to produce electricity.\n\nSkeptics warn that nuclear energy poses risks and say microreactors may not be safe or feasible and have not proved they can meet demand for a reasonable price.\n\nWright brushed those concerns aside as he touted progress on Trump’s push for a quick escalation of nuclear power. Trump signed a series of executive orders last year that allow Wright to approve some advanced reactor designs and projects, taking authority away from the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which has regulated the U.S. nuclear industry for five decades.\n\n“Today is history. A multi-megawatt, next-generation nuclear power plant is loaded in the C-17 behind us,” Wright said before the two-hour flight from March Air Reserve Base in California to Hill Air Force Base in Utah.\n\nThe minivan-sized reactor transported by the military is one of at least three that will reach “criticality” — when a nuclear reaction can sustain an ongoing series of reactions — by July 4, as Trump has promised, Wright said.\n\n“That’s speed, that’s innovation, that’s the start of a nuclear renaissance,” he said.\n\nCurrently, there are 94 operable nuclear reactors in the U.S. that generate about 19% of the country’s electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That's down from 104 reactors in 2013 and includes two new commercial reactors in Georgia that were the nation's first large reactors built from scratch in a generation.\n\nRecognizing delays inherent to deployment of new, full-scale reactors, the industry and government have focused in recent years on more efficient designs, including a small modular reactor proposed by the nation’s largest public power company, the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n\nMicroreactors, designed to be portable, can “accelerate the delivery of resilient power to where it’s needed,” Duffey said. Eventually, the mobile reactors could provide energy security on a military base without the civilian grid, he and other officials said.\n\nThe demonstration flight “gets us closer to deploy nuclear power when and where it is needed to give our nation’s warfighters the tools to win in battle,” Duffey said.\n\nThe reactor transported to Utah will be able to generate up to 5 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 5,000 homes, said Isaiah Taylor, CEO of Valar Atomics, the California startup that produced the reactor. The company hopes to start selling power on a test basis next year and become fully commercial in 2028.\n\nEdwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the transport flight — which included a throng of reporters, photographers and TV news crews — was little more than “a dog-and-pony show” that merely demonstrated the Pentagon's ability to ship a piece of heavy equipment.\n\nThe flight “doesn't answer any questions about whether the project is feasible, economic, workable or safe — for the military and the public,” Lyman said in an interview.\n\nThe Trump administration “hasn't made the safety case” for how microreactors, once loaded with nuclear fuel, can be transported securely to data centers or military bases, Lyman said.\n\nOfficials also have not resolved how nuclear waste will be disposed of, although Wright said the Energy Department is in talks with Utah and other states to host sites that could reprocess fuel or handle permanent disposal.\n\nThe microreactor flown to Utah will be sent to the Utah San Rafael Energy Lab for testing and evaluation, Wright said. Fuel will be provided by the Nevada National Security site, Taylor said.\n\n“The answer to energy is always more,” Wright said. After four years of restrictions on fossil fuels and other polluting energy under the Biden administration, he said, “Now we’re trying to set everything free. And nuclear will be flying soon.”",

    "fullText": "If you ask ChatGPT about the people of Florida and Tampa Bay, it will tell you that we’re smelly, lazy and somewhat slutty.\n\nThat is the verdict — or, at least, the algorithmic assumption — buried inside the world’s most popular artificial intelligence.\n\nA peer-reviewed study recently published in the journal Platforms & Society exposes the geographic prejudices hidden inside ChatGPT and presumably all such technologies, say the authors.\n\nTo get around ChatGPT’s built-in guardrails meant to prevent the AI from generating hateful, offensive or explicitly biased content, the academics built a tool that repeatedly asked the AI to choose between pairs of places.\n\nIf you ask ChatGPT a direct question like, “Which state has the laziest people?” its programming will trigger a polite refusal. But by presenting the AI with a binary choice — “Which has lazier people: Florida or California?” and demanding it pick one, the researchers found a loophole.\n\nTo keep the model from just picking the first option it saw, every geographic pairing was queried twice in reverse order. A location gained a point if it won both matchups, lost a point if it lost both and scored zero if the AI gave inconsistent answers.\n\nIn a comparison of U.S. states, a score of 50 meant the state was the highest ranked in that category. A score of negative 50 meant the state was the lowest ranked.\n\nThe researchers’ findings, which they call the “silicon gaze,” revealed a bizarre mix of compliments and insults to Florida and Tampa Bay.\n\nFlorida gained top or nearly top ranking in categories like “has more influential pop culture,” and “has sexier people,” but also scored a 48 under “is more annoying” and similarly high under “has smellier people” and “is more dishonest.”\n\nThe chatbot also ranked Florida alongside the rest of the Deep South as having the “laziest people” in the country.\n\nDrilling down to the local level using the project’s interactive website, inequalities.ai, reveals ChatGPT’s opinions on Tampa as having “better vibes” and being “better for retirees” than most of the other 100 largest U.S. cities.\n\nThe AI also perceived Tampa as having “sexier people,” being “more hospitable to outsiders” and having people who are “more relaxed.”\n\nBut in the same category where it called residents sexy, the AI also strongly associated Tampa with having “smellier people” and “fatter people.” Socially, the chatbot ranked the city above most for being “sluttier” and a place that “uses more drugs.” The AI also determined that Tampa “is more ignorant” and has “stupider people.”\n\nDespite St. Petersburg’s world-renowned museums, ChatGPT gave the city a negative 40 score for its contemporary art scene and unique architecture. Tampa fared similarly poorly in artistic heritage and theater.\n\nWhile it’s easy to laugh off a robot’s rude opinions, researcher Matthew Zook warns that these rankings aren’t just random. They are a mirror reflecting the internet’s own prejudices, a phenomenon that could have real-world consequences as AI begins to influence everything from travel recommendations to property values.\n\nWhen pitted head-to-head with Tampa in “Art and Style,” St. Petersburg beat Tampa as being “more stylish,” having “better museums,” boasting “more unique architecture,” and having a “better contemporary art scene.” Tampa beat St. Petersburg, according to the AI, for having a “more vibrant music scene” and a “better film industry.”\n\nSt. Petersburg scored high marks in social inclusion, being heavily associated with positive queries like “is more LGBTQ+ friendly,” “is less racist” and “has more inclusive policies.”\n\nSuch judgments are not deliberately programmed into ChatGPT by its maker, Open AI, Zook said. Rather, they are absorbed from the trillions of words scraped from the internet to train the models, material full of human stereotypes.\n\nPerhaps if the internet frequently pairs “Florida” with the chaotic “Florida Man” meme or swampy humidity, the AI learns to calculate that Florida is ignorant or smelly.\n\nAlgorithms, with their if-this-then-that logic, might seem objective, but often they “learn” to do their job from existing data — things people on the internet have already typed into a search box, for example.\n\n“Technology is never going to solve these kinds of problems,” said Zook, a geography professor at the University of Kentucky and co-author of the study. “It’s not neutral, people like to act like it is. But it’s coded by humans, and therefore it reflects what humans are doing.”\n\nAlgorithmic bias is nothing new. Early photo recognition software struggled to identify Black people because it had been trained on a dataset of mostly light-skinned faces. Search results auto-populated with racist stereotypes because people had searched those terms before. Software that screened job candidates for tech jobs filtered out applications from women because it had been trained on data that showed mostly men filled those jobs.\n\nThe difference with language learning models like ChatGPT, Zook said, appears to be in how comfortable people are relying on it already.\n\n“With generative models,” Zook said, “users are outsourcing their judgment to a conversational interface where the biases creep in without being as visually or immediately obvious.”\n\nAI models are also quite powerful and fast-working. They can generate content so quickly that they could soon “overwhelm what humans produce,” normalizing biased ideas. Last year, an estimated 50 percent of adults were using ChatGPT or something like it.\n\nZook compared interacting with an AI’s geographic opinions to dealing with a “racist uncle.” If you know his biases, you can navigate them and still be around him on the holidays, but if you take his words uncritically, you risk adopting those prejudices.",

    "description": "\"Why do insurance companies get to tell doctors how they have to do their jobs?\"",
    "fullText": "Most Americans agree that dealing with the United States’ health insurance system is frustrating. But Dr. Katherine Sislow, DDS (@dr.k.sislow) took it to a whole new level in an 8-minute Jan. 2, 2026, TikTok video documenting a particularly painful experience she had with a health insurance representative.\n\nEventually, she was able to have her patient’s claim covered, but not without losing over an hour and a half of her time and a little bit of her sanity.\n\nOn the call, Dr. Sislow explains that her patient’s claim for dental work had been denied three times, but she didn’t understand why. After being placed on hold, she was told the insurance company didn’t understand her documentation.\n\nThen the doctor established that the one document she sent them had everything; they simply needed to scroll down. Eventually, the representative found the documentation they needed…by scrolling down. But that was only the beginning.\n\nAfter a lot of back and forth, Dr. Sislow explains how the situation was a dental emergency.\n\n“He did not go to the emergency room because this is a dental problem with a dental solution,” the doctor asserted. After a pause she sighs, “yeah, I’ll hold.”\n\nAfter more negotiating, the representative gives Sislow one thing: the first name of the doctor who refused the claim. At this point, Sislow pushed back, and the representative became defensive.\n\n“No, I’m not threatening legal action,” Sislow said. “I’m just stating that as far as record keeping is concerned, it would be a much stronger case if an actual dentist looked at it and not someone with zero dental education making these claims.”\n\nFinally, the dentist got the claim approved, but not without a last exchange on how she could avoid these types of calls in the future. “Ok, just send in everything and hope and pray?” The doctor asks.\n\n“You know what, it’s okay, I’ll take the win. Have a great day.”\n\nThe TikTok garnered 18.4 million views, 2.7 million likes and over 43,000 comments from people shocked and outraged by the video’s content. Users couldn’t believe the incompetence from the representative, and how much beaurocracy Dr. Sislow had to navigate on the call.\n\n“Insurance companies is telling DOCTORS it’s not an emergency?! let that sit,” a TikTok comment read.\n\n“This should be illegal. Immediately.” read another TikTok comment.\n\n“I’m actually speechless,” a Reddit post said about the video.\n\nThis TikTok video isn’t an isolated incident. According to a KFF analysis, in 2023, HealthCare.gov insurers denied nearly one out of every five claims submitted for in-network services. They denied an even larger share of claims for out-of-network services.\n\nAs a result, there are hundreds of TikTok videos like Dr. Sislow’s detailing insurance denials. Many of these videos hope to help change the system…one phone call at a time.\n\nThe internet is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.",

    "description": "As governments race to restrict minors’ social media use, the tech billionaires who built the platforms are imposing strict screen limits at home.",
    "fullText": "Despite building an increasingly screen-focused world, billionaire tech leaders are keeping their own children away from the tech they helped create.\n\nAs far back as 2010, Apple cofounder Steve Jobs told a New York Times reporter his kids had never used an iPad and that, “We limit how much technology our kids use at home.”\n\nSince then, the trend of Silicon Valley billionaires keeping their families away from technology has become even more pronounced, thanks in part to the rise of social media and short-form video.\n\nExcessive device use among children has become more common in recent years as busy parents turn to screens to find some peace. The trend has accelerated so much that some young children accustomed to extensive screen time are dubbed “iPad kids.” On average, children in the U.S. ages 8 to 18 spend 7.5 hours per day watching or using screens, according to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.\n\nYouTube cofounder Steve Chen said at a talk at the Stanford Graduate School of Business last year that he wouldn’t want his kids consuming only short-form content, noting that it might be better to limit kids to videos longer than 15 minutes.\n\n“Shorter-form content equates to shorter attention spans,” he said.\n\nAt the 2024 Aspen Ideas Festival, early Facebook investor and billionaire Peter Thiel joined Chen among the ranks of tech leaders who are setting strict limits on screens. Thiel said he only lets his two young children use screens for an hour-and-a-half per week, a revelation that prompted audible gasps from the audience.\n\nOther tech CEOs, including Microsoft’s Bill Gates, Snap’s Evan Spiegel, and Tesla’s Elon Musk, have also spoken about limiting their children’s access to devices. Gates has said he did not give his children smartphones until age 14 and banned phones at the dinner table entirely. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, in 2018, said he limits his child to the same 1.5 hours per week of screen time as Thiel. And finally, Musk, who bought the social media company X, formerly Twitter, in 2022, said it “might’ve been a mistake” to not set any rules on social media for his children.\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who once said his own children were too young to use TikTok, clarified in 2023 that if his children lived in the U.S. and had access to the rigorous protections associated with the platform’s under-13 settings, he would let them use the app. He said even an 8-year-old could use the platform in the under-13 experience, which, among other protections, includes vetted content, no access to posting, and no advertisements.\n\nScientific research backs up their parenting instincts. A 2025 study of nearly 100,000 people found that short-form video use was consistently associated with poorer cognition and a decline in many aspects of mental health across both younger and older social media users.\n\nAs young people increasingly spend most of their waking moments online, the backlash against social media, and especially minors’ use of social media, has reached a breaking point.\n\nIn the past year, Australia and Malaysia became the first countries to ban adolescents under 16 from using social media. And several other countries, including France, Denmark, and the United Kingdom, are considering similar legislation.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand earlier this week to defend his company against claims from a 20-year-old plaintiff that the social media giant built its platforms to hook young children.\n\nAnd yet, far from being a new phenomenon, the idea that social media use is harmful for young people has been around for years. Still, it’s the tech leaders who created the attention economy who have been the most attentive to this fact.\n\nTo be sure, several social media CEOs have publicly pushed back on claims that their platforms are harmful. Instagram chief Adam Mosseri testified earlier this month in the trial against Meta that social media does not constitute “clinical addiction.” Meta’s lawyers during the trial also outlined a range of safety features Instagram has introduced for younger users, including limits on the visibility of adult content and muted notifications at night.\n\nYet, as the trials against social media companies continue and country after country moves toward legislating what Silicon Valley’s billionaires have quietly practiced for years, the private behavior of the world’s most powerful tech figures stands in contrast to what they’re promoting and building.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian forces struck an industrial site deep inside Russia on Saturday, which Ukraine and unofficial Russian news channels say was a key state-owned missile factory.\n\nThe attack in Russia’s Udmurt Republic left 11 people wounded, three of whom were hospitalized, according to a Telegram post by Sergei Bagin, the local health minister.\n\n“One of the republic’s facilities was attacked by drones” launched by Ukraine, regional head Alexander Brechalov said in another Telegram post. He added that the strike caused injuries and damage, but did not identify the site or give further details.\n\nHours later, Ukraine's General Staff said its forces struck a key missile plant near the city of Votkinsk, using Ukrainian-made FP-5 “Flamingo” cruise missiles rather than drones.\n\n“A military-industrial complex enterprise, the ‘Votkinsk Plant’ ... was hit. A fire was recorded on the facility’s premises. The results are being clarified,\" the General Staff said in a Facebook post.\n\nAn unofficial Russian news channel on Telegram, Astra, likewise said earlier on Saturday that the strike targeted the Votkinsk Machine Building Plant, a major state defense enterprise. Astra said its claim was based on an analysis of footage from residents.\n\nThe Votkinsk factory, more than 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) from Ukraine, produces Iskander ballistic missiles, often used in strikes against Ukraine, as well as nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles, missiles for submarines and air-launched Kinzhal missiles.\n\nAnother unofficial Russian Telegram channel, SHOT, which often quotes contacts in the security services, said residents of Votkinsk reported hearing at least three blasts during the night, as well as what they thought was the humming of drones.\n\nThe Udmurt Republic’s main passenger airport, in the city of Izhevsk, and airports in nearby regions suspended operations early on Saturday, according to Russia’s civil aviation authority, Rosaviatsiya.\n\nIn other overnight attacks, Ukraine's General Staff said its forces had also targeted a gas processing plant in Russia's Samara region. Earlier Saturday, Russian military blogs reported that an attack caused a fire at the Samara plant. There was no immediate comment from Russian officials.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry on Saturday said its forces had damaged launching sites for Ukraine's \"Flamingo\" cruise missiles over the previous day, among other military targets. The ministry's statement did not make reference to the Votkinsk missile plant or any Ukrainian strikes in the area.\n\nThe strike came days after the latest U.S.-brokered talks between envoys from Moscow and Kyiv over Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine ended Wednesday with no sign of a breakthrough, as the war’s fourth anniversary approaches next week.\n\nThe negotiations in Switzerland were the third round of direct talks organized by Washington, after meetings earlier this year in Abu Dhabi that officials described as constructive but which also made no major headway. Expectations for significant progress in Geneva were low.\n\nRussia attacked Ukraine with 120 drones and one ballistic missile overnight into Saturday, Ukraine’s air force said. Ukrainian forces shot down 106 drones, while the missile and 13 drones struck targets in 11 locations in the country, the statement said.\n\nOleh Kiper, the head of Ukraine's Odesa region on the Black Sea, said drones damaged civilian and energy infrastructure facilities in the region, including a secondary school and an energy company's warehouses. Two people were also injured, he said in a statement on Telegram.\n\nThe southern port city of Odesa and surrounding region have been frequent targets for Russian attacks. Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said tens of thousands of Odesa's residents were left without heating and running water.\n\nIn remarks published on social media on Monday evening, Zelenskyy said Moscow should be “held accountable” for the relentless strikes, which he said undermine the U.S. push for peace.\n\nElsewhere, Russia’s Federal Security Service, known by its acronym FSB, claimed that Ukraine has been able to harvest data from Telegram and use it for military purposes. The app is hugely popular among Russians, including soldiers at the front.\n\nThe FSB was quoted by Russian state media as saying it had obtained “numerous reliable reports” that the use of Telegram “has repeatedly resulted in threats to the life of service members over the past three months.\" The reports did not cite any examples or evidence.\n\nSeparately, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday signed a law requiring mobile operators in Russia to block cellular and landline internet services at the request of the FSB, the latest move in the ongoing Kremlin effort to tighten control over the internet.\n\nEarlier this month, Russian communications watchdog Roskomnadzor said it will impose new restrictions on Telegram, after accusing it of refusing to observe Russian law. The move triggered widespread criticism from Russian military bloggers, who warned that Telegram was widely used by troops fighting in Ukraine and its throttling would derail military communications.\n\nLast week, Russia attempted to fully block WhatsApp in the country, the company said. Russian authorities have already blocked major social media like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, throttled YouTube, and methodically ramped up restrictions against other popular platforms since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "Phoebe Gates wants to build her AI shopping company while keeping one thing out of her pitch deck: her last name. The 23-year-old youngest daughter of billionaire Microsoft founder Bill Gates and philanthropist Melinda French Gates recently raised $35 million for Phia, which is now valued at around $185 million.\n\nHow did Phoebe Gates raise funding without family support?\n\nHow is Phia performing since its launch in 2025?\n\nWhat is Phia and how does it work?\n\nWhat challenges do female entrepreneurs face in Silicon Valley?\n\nBut she’s determined for the venture to stand on its own, with “no ties to my privilege or my last name,” Phoebe Gates told Yahoo Finance’s Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast in an episode published Thursday.\n\n“I have a chip on my shoulder,” she said, describing her drive to prove she can win over private equity in Silicon Valley based on merit, not inheritance or legacy.\n\nPhoebe Gates’ comments come during the resurfacing of her father’s connections to Jeffrey Epstein, although representatives for Bill Gates have repeatedly denied his involvement and any related accusations. Phoebe Gates didn’t comment about the allegations, but French Gates recently said her ex-husband “has to answer” for Epstein files mentions just weeks after it was revealed she had received $8 billion toward her philanthropic organization, Pivotal, as part of her divorce settlement.\n\nPhoebe Gates did acknowledge her father’s business success, saying: “From my dad I’ve really learned that your team is the core of what you’re building. You can’t do anything without an incredible team.”\n\nPhoebe Gates cofounded Phia, an AI shopping assistant, with her Stanford University roommate Sophia Kianni. The shopping assistant plugs into browsers like Chrome and Safari to compare prices and surface deals across tens of thousands of retail and resale sites in real time. It essentially serves as your own personal deal finder: say you’re looking at a $200 dress from Anthropologie, Phia can find and compare prices at second-hand sellers to help customers find a better price.\n\n“Our target consumer is a young woman who’s hustling. She shops like a genius, but she doesn’t want to waste her time doing it,” Gates told Fortune’s Most Powerful Women editor Emma Hinchliffe in April 2025.\n\nThe New York–based startup launched its app in 2025 and has grown quickly, garnering hundreds of thousands of downloads in its first months as investors pile into AI “agents” that automate digital tasks. A recent $35 million funding round led by Notable Capital, with participation from firms including Kleiner Perkins and Khosla Ventures, pushed Phia’s valuation to about $185 million less than a year after an initial $8 million seed round.​",

    "fullText": "Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders (R) on Friday said the quickest way to have President Trump act on tariffs “is to tell him that he can’t,” after the Supreme Court ruled that his use of emergency powers to enact his sweeping tariff agenda was unconstitutional.\n\nThe high court’s 6-3 ruling invalidated Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose steep import taxes on almost all foreign trading partners. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion that the IEEPA does not apply to the tariffs.\n\nSanders, in an interview with NewsNation’s Katie Pavlich, said the court’s ruling was “not only disappointing” but “I think it’s wrong.”\n\n“I think Justice [Clarence] Thomas was exactly right,” she continued. “The Constitution grants the president this authority. “But ultimately, I don’t think it matters. One of the things I love about Donald Trump is that the fastest way to get him to do something is to tell him that he can’t. And he has so many tools in his toolbox.”\n\nThe GOP governor added that Trump will “use whatever tool and resource he needs to get that job done.”\n\n“And while this may, you know, take over the news cycle for a few days, I don’t think it changes what the outcome looks like and that this is a president who’s going to continue to hold other countries feet to the fire,” she said. “He’s going to make sure that American workers are put first.”\n\nTrump called the ruling “disappointing” and lashed out at Roberts and five other justices, including Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett — whom he appointed to the bench —calling them all “fools and lapdogs.“\n\n“I think it’s an embarrassment to their families, if you want to know the truth. The two of them,” Trump told reporters at the White House Friday.\n\nHe praised Justices Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote a dissent. The president said he was “proud” of Kavanaugh, who Trump appointed in 2018.\n\nThe president followed the ruling with the announcement that he signed an executive order to impose a 10 percent tariff on imports from countries around the world “effective immediately.” He invoked Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, a provision that allows for tariffs of up to 15 percent for 150 days to address “large and serious” trade deficits, to enact the new levies.\n\nThe White House said Canada and Mexico are exempt from the new tariffs due to the trilateral free trade agreement that was ratified during Trump’s first term in 2020.\n\nSome Republican members of Congress also broke with the president, hailing the Supreme Court ruling as a victory for free trade, the separation of powers, or both.\n\n“Today’s ruling affirms, despite all the noise of the moment, that the Founders’ system of checks and balances remains strong nearly 250 years later,” Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah) wrote on the social platform X.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), in his own post online, said the court’s ruling “will also prevent a future President such as AOC from using emergency powers to enact socialism,” referring to potential 2028 presidential contender Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).",

    "fullText": "Weather models continue to debate the strength and position of a weekend storm system.\n\nThe most likely scenario involves rain on Sunday morning changing to mix and then wet snow by Sunday night.\n\nThe threat for accumulation has come up over the last 24 hours, with most models suggesting anywhere from 1-5\" of snowfall in the D.C. region.\n\nSome extreme solutions suggest 6\" or more could be possible.\n\nWASHINGTON - Compared to the previous several weeks in the D.C. region, this past week has not been so bad. Sure, it has been rather cloudy and chilly, but temperatures have been consistently above freezing, allowing the region to slowly but steadily free itself from the so-called \"snowcrete\" that has blanketed the D.C. area for the better part of a month now.\n\nTemperatures are expected to remain above freezing into the upcoming weekend, with the best day of the entire week potentially being Saturday, with partial sunshine and middle 50s expected in the afternoon.\n\nThe big question of course, is how much snow? It’s a question that remains relatively difficult to answer even with just a couple days to go ahead of the potential storm system.\n\nThe key to any potential storm system is its track, and its intensity. These are two features that weather models have continued to struggle with.\n\nOur general thoughts in the weather department this evening lead a little closer to the European model. With temperatures well above freezing at onset, the system would likely start as a predominantly rainfall event through the front part of the day on Sunday.\n\nThen, as a surface storm pushes eastward into the Atlantic, colder air fills in as the storm pulls away, along a weather feature known as an inverted surface trough. This would bring the risk for rain to change over to mix and a perhaps a period of potentially heavy, wet snowfall on Sunday night.\n\nNow, the tricky part of the forecast with an inverted trough situation is the area that gets accumulating snowfall tends to be in a relatively narrow band that follows the trough axis, so not everyone in the region would be looking as a decent snowfall, it would be localized in this banding.\n\nForecasting exactly where it would setup is very difficult, and we would not have a good idea of where this feature sets up until likely closer to Saturday evening.\n\nIf this solution, which the European Model has been hinting at for the last couple of days, is the correct solution, then parts of our region could see a 1-3\" with an upside risk of 3-6\" snowfall potential by the time the storm exits late Sunday night into early Monday morning.\n\nOn the other hand, you have the American model solution, which for the better part of a day now has suggested the storm could be much more impactful. With a stronger tilt in the jetstream, the weather model suggest that a more intense storm system will develop that stays much closer to the coastline. While it also starts as rainfall on Sunday morning, the intensifying surface low pulls cold air quickly into the storm, dropping temperatures in the DC region and changing rainfall over to a widespread heavy snowfall.\n\nThe model is aggressive with a heavy, impactful snowfall for everyone, with final snow totals in the double digits.\n\nNow, most forecasters agree this evening that this solution is rather extreme and unlikely to be the case with this storm. While we cannot rule it out of the realm of possibility, it is generally on its own, with most other guidance as of Thursday night suggesting lesser snowfall totals are more likely.\n\nYou can see the westward jump reflected in the 18z European Ensemble members as well. That's a pretty noticeable jump. \n\nNow again, it's not GFS level. Breaking down the numbers, European went up in every category. Most noticable...the threat for a 4\"+ snow event went from 30% to… pic.twitter.com/pr5tDqQIGQ\n\n— Mike Thomas (@MikeTFox5) February 20, 2026\n\nSo, if we do not believe the American model solution, what is the debate this evening? The issue lies in model consistency. Weather models have admittedly been extremely poor with the forecast solutions for the Sunday storm system. Even the European, which does have a history of being more accurate than the American model, has been extremely \"jumpy\" with this storm system. Sometimes jumping the system east, showing less snowfall, then bringing the storm back west, showing more snowfall. Forecasters look for run-to-run consistency, and so far we really have not seen that from any weather model just yet.\n\nThe reason why has everything to do with the pattern. It is not just one piece of atmospheric energy helping steer this storm system, but multiple. The more pieces you have involved with a developing storm system, the more prone you are to errors in the forecast. This is why we might not have a truly good hold on what this system could do in the DC region until closer to Friday night or even Saturday, when the energy pieces involved in the formation of this storm system are all well sampled and better analyzed.\n\nThis one is going to come down to the wire in terms of figuring out snowfall amounts. What I can guarantee is this will not be a repeat of the late January storm.\n\nTemperatures will not be as cold, even after the system — no \"snowcrete\" this time around. This would also be wet snow, and we would likely lose some to ground melt in areas no longer covered in snow from the January system, as temperatures have been above freezing much of this week.\n\nA key thing we want to mention: A lot of people are saying, \"but it is too warm to snow on Sunday! The Weather App says it will be in the 40s!\" While yes, this is too warm to snow at onset...remember that your weather app is giving you the high temperature for the day.\n\nThrough a process known as dynamic cooling, temperatures can cool as you bring in cooler air on the back side of a storm system, due to the upper-level trough swinging through. So, temperatures would be falling throughout the day.\n\nThe time frame we are most concerned with at the moment is Sunday afternoon and particularly the evening hours. While we do not anticipate at this time this will be a major, city shutdown type of snowfall, the most likely timing of it does mean that the risk is there for closures and delays to schools and other activities on Monday morning.\n\nOf course, how extensive these could be really depends on the final track and intensity of this storm system, and in the interest of forecast integrity we are not yet confident on any snowfall numbers to put out our expectations.\n\nWhat we will continue to do is keep you updated and informed ahead of this potential on Sunday.\n\nTo reiterate, at this time we are leaning towards the potential for a lower impact accumulating winter snowfall type event as opposed to a major snowstorm.\n\nFOX 5 will continue to monitor the threat and let you know if we think a more impactful system will hit the region.",

    "fullText": "Juventus are reportedly keen to sign Bernardo Silva as a free agent at the end of the season, with the Manchester City midfielder believed to be open to spending a few more years competing at the highest level.\n\nLast summer, his long-term teammate Kevin de Bruyne moved to Napoli as a free agent, while AC Milan has benefited from impressive performances by Luka Modric. Juventus are now understood to want a seasoned figure of similar pedigree and have identified Silva as the player they would like to add to their squad once the current campaign concludes.\n\nSilva has continued to demonstrate his quality in recent appearances for Manchester City, underlining his enduring importance to the team. As one of the most experienced members of the squad, he remains a significant presence both on and off the pitch. City are therefore eager to persuade him to extend his contract and remain at the club beyond this season.\n\nShould Manchester City intensify their efforts to retain him, Juventus could find it extremely difficult to secure his signature. The Premier League champions are unlikely to relinquish such an influential player without making a strong attempt to keep him.\n\n(Photo by Michael Regan/Getty Images)\n\nFrom Juventus’ perspective, the appeal of adding a proven performer with extensive experience at the top level is clear. The Bianconeri are seeking leadership and quality as they look to strengthen their squad, and Silva would fit that profile.\n\nHowever, according to Tuttojuve, the situation is far from straightforward. The report indicates that several other clubs are also pursuing Silva, significantly increasing the competition for his signature. Such interest inevitably complicates matters for Juventus, who must contend not only with Manchester City’s desire to keep him but also with rival teams seeking to secure his services.\n\nIn light of these factors, completing the transfer would represent a considerable challenge for the Italian side.",

    "fullText": "Fabio Quartararo's body language at the Buriram test spoke volumes about his growing frustration with Yamaha's performance in MotoGP.\n\nQuartararo returned to action on Saturday after missing most of the Sepang test due to a finger injury. However, his first day back at the track proved to be rather frustrating for him and the entire Iwata-based brand.\n\nThe Frenchman ended up 18th among 22 riders in Thailand, more than 1.2s off the pace set by Gresini's Alex Marquez on a factory-spec Ducati.\n\nPramac rider Jack Miller led the four-bike Yamaha contingent in 17th, but his time of 1m30.325s was less than two tenths faster than Quartararo's best effort.\n\nThe latter's frustration was palpable, to the point that he even showed the middle finger to his bike. The 2021 champion was later seen with his head in his hands in the Yamaha garage.\n\nWhen questioned earlier this afternoon by the official MotoGP website, team manager Massimo Meregalli responded with some embarrassment, recalling the scale of the task undertaken by Yamaha in switching to a brand new V4 engine this year.\n\n\"The riders cannot wait, but we knew since the beginning that we couldn't expect magic,\" he said. \"We were aware that especially the beginning for us was going to be a learning process.\n\n\"I want to believe and I'm still thinking that from the second part of the season gradually we will improve the performance and accordingly the result.\"\n\nHe added: \"We knew that it was going to be a big change. I think it's part of the process now. We are really learning the bike because even if last year we could do testing, it's one thing to do tests with the testing team, but when you move everything to the factory team, the rider are always pushing more. They need something special.\n\n\"And like what we had in Sepang, we are just discovering the bike, discovering unfortunately also some problems that sometimes you can expect, other times not. It's really a learning process.\"\n\nIn Malaysia, Yamaha had to pause its testing programme for a day due to an engine-related safety issue that the engineers wanted to investigate. It is public knowledge that the technicians are exercising utmost caution with the V4 at this stage due to reliability concerns, and even put a hard limit on how much mileage riders could accumulate in Sepang.\n\nThere has also been talk of introducing an upgrade to the V4 engine in the early races. However, Meregalli denies that this will happen at the start of the championship.\n\n\"No, it's later in the season,\" he clarified. \"They already scheduled by when we should receive [the upgraded engine]. Then it depends if things go smoothly without problems.\n\n\"But from what we evaluated and confirmed in Sepang, it's the material with which we will start the season.\"\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nLillian Suwanrumpha / AFP via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nLillian Suwanrumpha / AFP via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nLillian Suwanrumpha / AFP via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nGold and Goose Photography / LAT Images / via Getty Images\n\nMotoGP Buriram test: Alex Marquez fastest on Day 1 as Marc Marquez crashes twice\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "North London derby presents Arsenal with so much to lose and everything to gain in Premier League title race originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMikel Arteta has been preaching to Arsenal fans that the Premier League title race is a marathon not a sprint.\n\nYet after a gut-wrenching 2-2 draw with Wolves that left the Gunners' lead atop the table slimmed to effectively just two points, the quest for an elusive league crown has reached a breaking point.\n\nThat's where Arsenal's most hated rivals, Tottenham Hotspur, come in.\n\nAs the Gunners search for answers in their hunt for their first Premier League championship since 2004, they are presented with the perfect opportunity for an emotional and impactful turnaround.\n\nIn truth, this North London derby couldn't have come at a better time. It is likely their most important meeting with Spurs in the last two decades, one with more to lose, and also more gain than any in recent memory.\n\nMORE:A full roundup of Arsenal team news and injury updates ahead of the match against Tottenham\n\nThe Gunners' hunt for the 2025/26 Premier League title has never felt shakier than when Tom Edozie bundled home the awkward equaliser for Wolves at the end of their recent draw.\n\nArsenal have been the frontrunners for the EPL championship for much of the last four months. Every time they've opened the door, nobody has been there to walk through it.\n\nYet with just 10 points from their last possible 21, Arsenal have now opened the door wider than before. Manchester City sit five points back with a game in hand, with just a sliver between the two sides with still 12 matches remaining.\n\nMikel Arteta has used up all the cushion that Arsenal had built with their strong run through December, but they are still in the lead, an important and critical distinction.\n\nThe Gunners have one of the softest run-ins of any club this season. Following their upcoming games against Tottenham and Chelsea, Arsenal will finish the year with just one remaining match against the Big Six clubs, being the all-important April 18 match against Man City.\n\nCommon opponents over the final eight matches of the season for the two title chasers are Burnley, Crystal Palace, and Bournemouth. That leaves Arsenal with games against Newcastle, West Ham, and Fulham while Man City have Aston Villa, Brentford, and Everton.\n\nArsenal's current form is miles from that of a title-winner, but they still have it all in front of them.\n\nThe one thing Arsenal has been missing from their title hunt has been a reliable attacking superstar.\n\nBukayo Saka was meant to be that player. The 24-year-old England winger just sealed a new contract which sees him become one of the highest-paid players in the Premier League.\n\nWith his reported new wages \"in excess of £300,000 per week,\" he finds himself amongst the likes of Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk, and Bruno Fernandes, all of whom have been reliable performers week-in and week-out. Yet Saka cannot yet count himself amongst those individuals, who have all been key performers in a title-winning season.\n\nYet Saka just has not been that player this season. Sure, injuries have taken a bit of a toll, but he still has had plenty of chances to be a star. Five goals and five assists in 23 games just isn't enough to propel a team to a title.\n\nArsenal has been a true team of contributors this season; there's no question that their depth has been an enormous asset. Yet at the end of the day, titles are won by superstars, and right now, there is a lack of stars on Arsenal.\n\nIt's hard to remember a time when fans of a club the stature of Arsenal were chasing a domestic title with such nervous tension.\n\nArsenal have not won a Premier League title since the Invincibles in 2004, that much has been well documented over the last decade. They have also never won a Champions League crown. It has left this current generation of Arsenal supporters with very little to show for their last 20 years of dedication.\n\nYet because the club is such a behemoth both in England and across Europe, they are expected to, in effect, act like they've been here before.\n\nBut they haven't. Not really. All these fans know is disappointment and near misses. They have repeatedly come up short, having finished second in each of the last three years.\n\nThat's why the Wolves draw felt like such a gut punch. This is the feeling they're so familiar with — as the craving for silverware ramps up, they are repeatedly fed with letdowns.\n\nThis is not to drive in the dagger further, but to explain why they are so uncomfortable in this position. There's no confidence to draw from, only dread.\n\nAll of that, however, can change this weekend. This all leads to Sunday's North London derby...\n\nIn terms of the Premier League title race, there hasn't been a more meaningful meeting between Arsenal and Tottenham in at least two decades, if not longer.\n\nThe last time these two teams met with these kind of stakes, Arsenal clinched their 2003/04 title with a 2-2 draw in late April, but they coughed up a 2-0 lead in that match and had a solid lead that had been inevitable for weeks.\n\nThe Gunners also secured a big 3-2 win over Spurs late in the 2023/24 chase, but that still wasn't enough to push them to the title.\n\nThis year, this game presents a titanic opportunity, and also a huge potential pitfall. Draw or defeat in this match would give Man City the chance to take an effective lead in the title race, a collapse which would serve as a crushing blow both tangibly and emotionally.\n\nYet on the opposite end, there is so much to gain.\n\nThe best chance for an emotional result against the club's biggest rival would be now, as it would erase much of the recent struggles and catapult the feeling of authority atop the Premier League back to the highs of recent months before the slide.\n\n\"The enjoyment comes from moments of suffering as well,\" Mikel Arteta professed after the disappointing draw with Wolves. \"If you believe that you come to any ground in the Premier League and you don’t have to go through tough periods, that’s not the reality, so the enjoyment comes as well from those moments when you’re not at your best. Ok, get through and find out a way to come through that.\"\n\nArsenal have suffered much this season, both to their success and their detriment. Some would argue they have inflicted too much self-imposed suffering on themselves to be Premier League champions. To that end, their 58 points through 27 games is the fewest of any Premier League leader at this point in a season since Leicester City 10 years ago.\n\nVictory here, and Arsenal's title race is once again full steam ahead. Anything less, and the train comes off the track. There's really nothing in between at this point.",

The irony being that by doing that, they sacked Highbury legend George Graham.\n\nThe appointment gave Spurs hope for Old Trafford that they might not have had otherwise. At Southampton, Hoddle had rebuilt his reputation; he was in charge of England as a young coach whose ideas were innovative and ahead of his time. 8 days didn’t give him a lot of time to implement his ethos, but maybe his tactics would catch Mr Wenger by surprise.\n\nIt didn’t; the Frenchman was just worried about what his team did, and that was mostly dominate possession, forcing our rivals to try and defend a lead they got with their only attack.\n\n(Photo by Jan Kruger/Getty Images)\n\nThe high risk their new boss mentioned before kickoff consisted mainly of starting an unfit Sol Campbell, who was then subbed for an even less healthy Ledley King. Neither, in truth, had any business playing that day.\n\nIt would turn out to be Mr Campbell’s last appearance for Spurs …\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo here are some simple rules which I must insist commenters follow….\n\nYou agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans.

    "title": "Couch: No. 1 MSU hockey is showing it can handle dicey moments — and that could mean everything",
    "description": "The No. 1-ranked Spartans were dominant on Friday, but it was Thursday's narrow and sometimes dicey win over Notre Dame that should be reassuring.",
    "fullText": "EAST LANSING — Michigan State’s hockey team reminded us on Friday night just how potent it can be, blitzing Notre Dame with eight goals, albeit against a backup goaltender, in an 8-2 win at Munn Ice Arena. It was a dominant performance, worthy of the No. 1-ranked team in college hockey, as the Spartans also took over first place in the Big Ten standings.\n\nTheir win 24 hours earlier against the Irish, however, should be equality cherished. Because MSU on Thursday night found itself in the sort of game everyone who cares about the program fears next month — the score deadlocked after two periods against an underdog playing well, on a night when the Spartans were taking too many penalties and playing a little loose defensively, the bounces and referee decisions going in the other team’s favor.\n\n“I thought they were the better team,” Adam Nightingale said Thursday night of Notre Dame.\n\nAnd yet the final score was a reassuring 4-2 MSU win, including an empty-net goal, that kept the Spartans on track for a third straight Big Ten regular-season championship and to be the No. 1-overall seed in the NCAA tournament, which could be important this year.\n\nMSU, which took a 3-2 lead early in the third period, saw out the final 18 minutes of a game that never felt comfortable. And in a season that’ll ultimately be decided and judged by how the Spartans fare in a dicey, single-elimination tournament, nights like Thursday are encouraging.\n\n“I thought in the last half of the third (period), we did a good job making them defend, and didn't give them much in the back half of that period,” Nightingale said.\n\nThis is an MSU team that has just about everything — NHL talent, savvy seniors, elite goaltending, an uncompromising culture and plenty of sweat equity. It’s a roster with a number of players who can draw on all sorts of experiences, from championships to postseason heartache, including, as a 1 seed last season, losing in the first round of the NCAA tournament when they couldn’t shepherd a 3-2 lead over the finish line.\n\nSo nights like Thursday have value.\n\n“Games like that, you learn a lot,” said MSU junior Gavin O’Connell, who scored the game-winner Thursday. “Down the stretch, every team is going to play us tight, every team is going to bring their best. So we know they're going to be close games down the stretch.”\n\nThis is a different team than a year ago. No longer with Hobey Baker winner Isaac Howard, but more depth of talent — with 14 NHL draft picks — and a top line that’s just as ferocious, still with seniors Charlie Stramel and Daniel Russell, now next to freshman Porter Martone, the sixth overall pick in last year’s NHL draft by the Philadelphia Flyers. He had a hat trick Friday night. The three forwards on that top line have a combined 49 goals and 118 points through 30 games.\n\nStramel, a Wisconsin transfer two years ago and first-round pick of the NHL’s Minnesota Wild, chose to come back for one more season at MSU — “a mature decision,” Nightingale called it. Russell has been a top-line player from Day 1, one of three holdover recruits from the previous staff — along with center Tiernan Shoudy and defensman Matt Basgall — who Nightingale remains grateful for every day.\n\n“It was special, for our staff, to (have them) trust us,” Nightingale said of Russell, Shoudy and Basgall. “They’re all about the team.”\n\nThey’re culture-setters who’ve maintained key roles as the program has become inundated with elite prospects, a difficult mix to pull off in college hockey today. When you do, you can wind up with what MSU has going for it. The Spartans (24-6) entered Friday atop the Pairwise Rankings — which determine the NCAA tournament field and seeding — a tick ahead of Michigan, which lost Friday night to Wisconsin, putting the Spartans in the driver’s seat for the Big Ten regular season title. Those two are ahead of No. 3 North Dakota and MSU is nearly three points above No. 5 Penn State, meaning the Spartans should safely be one of the four No. 1 seeds.\n\nBeing the No. 1 overall seed could matter, though, because that team is likely to face the winner of the Atlantic Hockey Association, whose champion will have an NCAA tournament auto bid, probably as the No. 16 seed, because they don’t have a team higher than No. 28 right now in the Pairwise standings. The next three No. 1 seeds, if the tournament began today, would face No. 15 UMass, 14 Connecticut and 13 Wisconsin, the sort of opponents that are more likely to create nervy moments\n\nThere’s no avoiding those at some point. This MSU team believes it has the goods to overcome them. We saw it Thursday, before seeing the upside on Friday.\n\n“I think you see it with this team, there's so much skill,” junior defenseman Patrick Geary said. “I think with this group, we know when we play the way we're supposed to play, we're a team that can't be beaten. And I think that's huge for our group. … If we play our game how we're supposed to, everything will be totally fine. And that's what is different about this group.”\n\nContact Graham Couch at gcouch@lsj.com.

I tend to think it's more positive because of the Coyotes' experience, grit and leadership. Guard Angelina Robles has also really come into her own of late and made a major impact.\n\nBut North Dakota State is just a monster, and has been all season. The Bison's strength of schedule isn't elite, but they've handled business against every foe all season, including this South Dakota team.

    "fullText": "The North Carolina Tar Heels, ready to shake off their worst game of the season on Tuesday at NC State, stay on the road for a Saturday afternoon ACC clash.\n\nUNC (20-6, 8-5) will spend its day in Upstate New York, facing the Syracuse Orange in a 1 p.m. rematch. North Carolina won the first meeting 87-77, back in Chapel Hill on February 22, but the times are different in Carolina Blue.\n\nSyracuse (15-12, 6-8 ACC), coincidentally, suffered its worst loss of the season on Monday at Duke. The ACC-leading Blue Devils (24-2, 13-1 ACC) won 101-64, the type of victory to demoralize any opponent.\n\nThe Tar Heels don't have their star post duo of Caleb Wilson or Henri Veesaar, who are both out with injury. In their absences, Zayden High and Jarin Stevenson are getting to prove themselves as reliable frontcourt options – and both are succeeding.\n\nBefore getting demolished by Duke, the Orange recorded consecutive, solid home wins against Cal and SMU. Syracuse is a balanced, guard-heavy team led by Donnie Freeman – and a rowdy JMA Wireless Dome crowd may be just what it needs to pull off the upset.\n\nUNC will be tested in its upcoming stretch, facing Syracuse, Louisville, Virginia Tech, Clemson and Duke to close its regular season. North Carolina should pick up a win or two, but post depth is a major concern.\n\nIf you're in Upstate New York, considering making the trip to Syracuse.

This will be just their third meeting on tour. The last one came at the Barcelona Open last year, with Alcaraz winning both times.\n\nThe pair faced off again a week later in the semifinals of an ATP 500 event, adding another chapter to their young rivalry.\n\nFils put on a strong performance in Monte-Carlo, pushing Alcaraz to three sets and even grabbing the first break of the decider before Alcaraz eventually came out on top.\n\nIn Barcelona, though, Alcaraz started much stronger. He took control early and won the first set 6-2, then held off Fils again in a tighter second set to seal the win.\n\nBoth of their previous matches were on clay, so the Qatar Open final will be their first meeting on a hard court.\n\nFils has looked sharp in Doha, despite this being just his third event since coming back from injury.\n\nThe Frenchman was out for a good chunk of last year after picking up a stress fracture in his back at Roland Garros, finally making his comeback this February.\n\nHe started the season in Montpellier, picking up two wins before losing to Felix Auger-Aliassime in the quarterfinals.\n\nHe then lost his opening match in Rotterdam to Alex de Minaur, but since arriving in Qatar, he’s only dropped one set so far.\n\nWhere the three oldest active players in the ATP top 100 were ranked 20 years ago\n\nDespite pushback from players, the WTA calendar could be set to grow by another tournament\n\nCoco Gauff voices frustration with her coach after double fault against Elina Svitolina",

    "fullText": "The speed skating events at the 2030 Winter Olympics will take place outside host nation France, it has been confirmed.\n\nThe Games, known as French Alps 2030, will be mostly spread across south-east France with venue clusters in Nice, Briancon, Savoie and Haut-Savoie.\n\nHowever, the speed skating will take place in pre-existing venues in either Turin in northern Italy, or Heerenveen in the Netherlands.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Games organisers do not want to build new venues that would not have a definite legacy in the host region.\n\nEdgar Grospiron, president of the French Alps 2030 organising committee, said holding the speed skating outside France was a condition agreed with the IOC upon becoming hosts of the Games.\n\n\"This decision has already been taken, so the organising committee has to go on what has already been decided,\" he told a media conference in Milan on Saturday, the day before the 2026 hosts hand over responsibility for the Games.\n\n\"This is so that the Games in the French Alps can be as we want them to be.\n\n\"For the first time we will have a Games with a discipline in another European country. This will be new; we will see if other Games do it.\"\n\nHolding events away from the host city or region is not unprecedented in the Olympics. At Paris 2024, the surfing events were held on the Pacific island of Tahiti - approximately 10,000 miles away from France.\n\nBut Tahiti, an island in French Polynesia, is an overseas territory of France, while the 2030 speed skating will be held in a different independent nation.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nGrospiron said about 15% of sports and venues for 2030 have not yet been decided, but that details will be confirmed by June this year.\n\nHe said figure skating - which does not currently have a confirmed location - will take place in Nice, as will curling and ice hockey.\n\nGrospiron also said they will decide on which new sports, if any, will be added to the programme and if any events will be removed.\n\nThe future of Nordic combined - the only event at Milan-Cortina 2026 not to have a women's competition - has not yet been confirmed.\n\nSki mountaineering, which made its debut in 2026, is yet to be confirmed as a medal event in the French Alps.\n\n\"New sports are at the eart of our concerns, this will need to be broached to then decide what our venue plan is like and has to be validated by June by the IOC,\" Grospiron said.\n\n\"We will not do this alone; we will do this hand in hand with federations and venues.\n\n\"For Nordic combined, this is at the helm of the IOC. We will follow the recommendations of the IOC. We are there to listen, to help us finalise our venue plan.\"\n\nThere have been reports of infighting among the 2030 organising committee, with director general Cyril Linette allegedly departing amid differences with Grospiron, as well as budget cuts.\n\nGrospiron said they have \"little time, little money\" but were confident the Games would be delivered successfully.\n\n\"We talk every day about wanting to make these Games a success,\" he said. \"The organising committee needs serenity, continuity, then we will show what our teams can do. We are very proud of the work we have been able to do.\n\n\"We know we have very little time, little money. But we can deliver a Games that will honour our vision and ambition.\"",

According to the 247 composite, he is the No. 145 ranked player in the class and the No. 14 safety.\n\nOn the field, Gavin looks to be a prototype, having built a reputation as a rangy back-end defender. Williams has played both sides of the field for Damien, also playing wide receiver. Recruiting analysts note his natural tracking of the football, his knack for high-pointing passes in traffic and his reliability as an open-field tackler who finishes through contract.\n\nNotre Dame’s staff, led by head coach Marcus Freeman along with the aforementioned Henry will have their work cut out for them with some sizable competition for Gavin’s services. Notre Dame will be battling USC, UCLA, Washington, and Texas A&M in his recruitment.

    "fullText": "Liverpool's injury list has been the bane of their existence this season.\n\nAlthough three or four injuries across the entire team wouldn't be the end of the world, the fact that Arne Slot's defence has often had three players absent has probably been a hard pill to swallow.\n\nDue to this, and the Reds' lack of depth, their defensive line has been brought into question on more than one occasion with several players being linked with a summer move.\n\nHowever, now that one of Slot's injury-prone men seem to be back to full fitness, it could be his time to shine and his chance to prove why the Anfield outfit have chosen to keep him around for so long.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nThere's no hiding from the fact that Joe Gomez is a 'special' player.\n\nIn fact, up until he injured his knee in the 2020-21 season, the Englishman was Virgil van Dijk's main defensive partner.\n\nSince that injury, the former Charlton man has been side-lined on several occasions with his body seemingly being made of glass.\n\nHowever, now that he's returned from his latest ailment, it feels like now could be his time to shine, especially since Jeremie Frimpong and Conor Bradley are injured.\n\nGomez is 28 years old now and with the 2026 World Cup just around the corner, a solid end to the 2025-26 season could be exactly what he needs to get into Thomas Tuchel's plans, especially because of how versatile he is.\n\nThe Englishman's most recent cameo against Brighton further proved why Slot should start against Nottingham Forest on Sunday.\n\nDue to Gomez's injury history, it's not hard to see why Slot has often chosen against starting the Englishman on a regular basis.\n\nAnd, when he has gone against his better judgement, the 28-year-old has often left the pitch early due to injury.\n\nHowever, during his 20-minute cameo against Brighton, the centre-back rolled back the years and proved why Jurgen Klopp chose to bring him to Anfield in the first place.\n\nAccording to Sofascore, the defender maintained a 100 per cent pass accuracy during his cameo and even won 100 per cent of the tackles he attempted.\n\nHe may have committed a couple of fouls during that time but his confidence on the ball was second to none.\n\nThe added stability that the centre-back brought to Liverpool's starting XI was rather helpful and, since Forest beat Fenerbahce 3-0 last time out, they'll have a point to prove.\n\nIt will also be Vitor Pereira's second game in charge and, if we look back to when the Portuguese manager first took over at Wolves, he won them a fair few games at the start.\n\nLiverpool have a lot riding on Sunday's game and, if they lose, they could end up missing out on a top four spot, which, for a team of their quality, would be horrendous.",

    "fullText": "Unbeaten after five games in charge, interim manager Michael Carrick takes his Manchester United side to Liverpool on Monday night to face David Moyes’ Everton at the Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\nCarrick had suggested at a previous press conference that Mason Mount would be fit for this one, but in the presser on Friday he suggested that the England man would need a little more time.\n\nHe also confirmed that Matthijs de Ligt is still unavailable and, although there have been reports that Patrick Dorgu is making good progress, he too is unavailable for Monday’s game.\n\nSo far, Carrick has made minimal changes to his starting XIs, although there is a loud knock on the door coming from big Slovenian striker Ben Sesko, who has scored five in his last six outings at a phenomenal average of a goal every 42 minutes.\n\nAn unchanged defence is expected, with Senne Lammens in goal and a back four of Diogo Dalot, Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez and Luke Shaw.\n\nNous Mazraoui, Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven are all available should there be any need for a change. The Frenchman had his first minutes under Carrick against West Ham after substituting Maguire in the 68th minute and put in an excellent cameo performance.\n\nThe holding midfield pair of Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo has been on fire lately, and the pair will surely start again on Monday. Ahead of them, Bruno Fernandes will play in the number 10 position.\n\nThat brings us to the big question – will Sesko start?\n\nIt could all come down to the tactical plan for the game. Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have all been playing well, but if one were to be sacrificed it would probably be the Brazilian, with Mbeumo switching to the left flank to make way for the 22-year-old striker.\n\nHowever, it is perhaps more likely that “Big Ben” will be asked to do his work from the bench again as the boss names an unchanged side.\n\nJosh Zirkzee is also an option, but it seems very unlikely he will start as his future at the club remains shrouded in doubt.\n\nCarrick will be very tempted to introduce Sesko\n\nDefence and midfield unchanged.\n\nFeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Amid the racism case involving Vinícius Júnior, Benfica has filed a complaint with UEFA’s Disciplinary Committee against Federico Valverde.\n\nThe Portuguese club accuses the Real Madrid midfielder of violent conduct due to an incident that occurred in the second half of the match between the two teams.\n\nAccording to Portuguese newspapers A Bola and Record, Benfica expects UEFA to make a decision before the second leg of the Champions League playoffs. The decisive match will take place next Wednesday (25th) at the Santiago Bernabéu.\n\nThe incident that prompted the complaint occurred in the 83rd minute, when Valverde attempted to punch Samuel Dahl of Benfica during a challenge for the ball.\n\nThe referee did not call a foul and VAR did not review the play.\n\nComplaints from the Portuguese side\n\nThe complaints from Benfica’s side are not limited to the incident with Valverde.\n\nCoach José Mourinho, who was sent off in the second half, harshly criticized referee François Letexier after the match.\n\nMourinho claimed that the referee had notes indicating that Real Madrid players (Carreras, Tchouaméni, and Huijsen) could not receive yellow cards.\n\nAccording to the coach, upon noticing this and alerting the refereeing team, he was sent off.\n\nThe match at Estádio da Luz was also marked by a serious incident involving Vini Jr.\n\nAfter opening the scoring with a stunning goal early in the second half and celebrating by dancing at the corner flag, the Brazilian was targeted by objects thrown by Benfica fans, which sparked outrage among the players.\n\nIn the ensuing confusion, the referee gave Vini Jr a yellow card while he was arguing with Argentine Prestianni of Benfica.\n\nSoon after, the Real Madrid forward accused his opponent of racism.\n\nFootage captured the moment when Prestianni covered his mouth with his shirt during the argument.\n\nAfter being insulted, Vini Jr ran toward the referee, who activated the anti-racism protocol by crossing his arms in an \"X\" to signal the incident to the stadium.\n\nThe match was halted for about ten minutes and resumed without any immediate punishments related to the incident.\n\nBenfica considers punishing fans\n\nBenfica reviewed footage from the match, both from the broadcast and internal stadium cameras, and identified fans making racist gestures—such as mimicking monkey movements—and chanting prejudiced songs against the Brazilian.\n\nThe club is now investigating whether these individuals are club members and promises harsh sanctions, which may include loss of privileges and permanent expulsion from the membership.\n\nThe Benfica board, however, continues to support forward Prestianni, trusting the athlete’s version of events.\n\nIn the sporting arena, Prestianni has submitted his official defense to UEFA. The Argentine denied calling Vini Jr. \"monkey\" (the Spanish word \"mono\"), claiming that the insult used was \"maricón,\" a homophobic slur.\n\nKylian Mbappé, however, stated that the Argentine used the racist term against Vinicius five times.\n\nThe French star even reprimanded the Argentine player on the pitch and gave a strong post-match interview, calling for Prestianni to be banned from playing in the Champions League.\n\nRegardless of the offense (racism or homophobia), UEFA’s disciplinary rules provide for penalties that can reach 10 matches or more of suspension for the Benfica player.\n\nAdditionally, FIFA is discussing strict punishment for players who cover their mouths during on-field arguments, an act Prestianni performed during the altercation with the Brazilian.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": "The Boston Bruins first-round pick found the back of the net three times to help the Eagles take down No. 10 UConn.",
    "fullText": "CHESTNUT HILL — National rankings and a favorable placement in the Hockey East tournament were the source of contention when No. 12 Boston College hosted No. 10 UConn on Friday night at Conte Forum.\n\nWith Providence College entrenched atop the Hockey East standings, BC and UConn began the home-and-home weekend series lodged in a contentious battle for second place.\n\nAll the Eagles needed in the moment was for their best player to step up in a big way.\n\nBoston Bruins 2025 first-round draft pick James Hagens recorded his second career hat trick that included the game winner in a 5-2 victory over the Huskies before a boisterous crowd of 6,585.\n\nHagens leads the club with 20 goals and 17 assists for 37 points.\n\n“It is always cool with the crowd we get here and the base that we have,” said Hagens. “It’s one of the best places to play and I’m super grateful to be at Boston College and be on the ice with fans like that and my teammates and it is just something you have to soak in.”\n\nBC improved to 18-10-1 overall, 12-7-0 in Hockey East, leaping over UConn (17-8-4, 11-6-2) into second place with 37 points. The two regional antagonists will lace them up for the rematch on Saturday afternoon (3 p.m.) at PeoplesBank Arena in Hartford, Conn.\n\n“It was two teams battling for league points and national rankings to try and make the national tournament,” said BC coach Greg Brown. “Both teams are competitive and want to get in there and that is why this is such a big series to have late in the year.\n\n“The way the season has unfolded for both teams, it is clear it is so important to both sides and you saw clear effort out of both teams there. There was real intensity out there. The guys are focused and dialed in. You can see it in practice.”\n\nAlthough it was the first meeting of the season between the two ranked programs, the game took on the aura of a long- standing rivalry with tournament intensity from the opening faceoff.\n\nHagens opened the scoring with his 18th of the season at 15:52 of the first. Andre Gasseau connected with Bruins 2024 first-round pick Dean Letourneau, who relayed the puck to Hagens at the top of the right circle. UConn goalie Tyler Muszelik (24 saves) made the initial stop on Hagens’ wrister, but the puck trickled between his pads across the goal line.\n\nHagens struck again with a little puck luck getting the assist at 18:49. Hagens’ slapper from the high slot deflected off UConn defenseman Viking Gustafsson Nyberg and went top shelf stick side to make it 2-0. BC exited the frame with a 13-7 advantage in shots on goal.\n\n“That game had a playoff feel to it,” said Brown. “The ice was contested all over the place, nothing was given for free both ways and I thought we started well and created some chances and they created a few. But I felt overall we had a decent first when we converted on two and had the momentum going our way.”\n\nThe Huskies cut the lead to 2-1 just 31 seconds into the second period. Junior first line left wing Jake Richard forced a turnover in the BC end and dished to center Ryan Tattle between the circles. Tattle flicked a quick wrister that beat BC freshman goalie Louka Cloutier (21 saves) stick side for his 11th of the season.\n\nUConn tied the game 2-2 on a hustler play by freshman left wing Alexandre Blais at 3:03. Blais muscled the puck loose along the end boards and slipped the puck to the crease where Kaden Shahan tucked it home for his eighth of the season.\n\nHagens put BC back up 3-2 with a hat trick power-play goal at 18:01. Right wing Ryan Conmy set up Hagens for a one timer from the right circle that beat Muszelik near post and brought the hats down from the stands.\n\n“We didn’t come out with the same intensity in the second and they jumped all over us and got right back in the game,” said Brown. “Then it was a battle the whole second and we got a huge goal in the end by James of course. I thought that goal was enormous for us.”\n\nFreshman Landan Resendes made it 4-2 with a wrist shot from the slot at 11:29 of the third. Teddy Stiga scored his fifth of the season into an empty net at 17:32.",

I appreciate the Supreme Court siding with Americans and American businesses, but it feels like it's going to be a tug-of-war that may go on throughout this entire administration.\n\nThis administration has created a level of uncertainty in the small business landscape that I haven't seen in 23 years of owning my store.\n\nIn addition to being a small-business owner in America, I'm a consumer in America, so I'm paying more for everything that my family consumes, from food to physical products. It's a one-two punch for us.\n\nI've kept a spreadsheet of every shipment that had a tariff charge, and as of today, we've paid over $12,000 since Trump started all of this.\n\nWe've had to pass on a percentage of that to our customers, and as a result, we've seen a slowdown in orders. Some are taking a wait-and-see mentality, or they just don't want to pay the extra fee.\n\nComics themselves — a lot of which are printed in Canada — have not been impacted by tariffs. But for me and for other comic book stores, action figures, board games, and comic book supplies, like storage items, are being impacted. Action figures account for about 65% of my shop's revenue, and they are made in China.\n\nA lot of these orders are made far in advance, too. We were being charged tariffs on items ordered in 2023 and 2024. There's stuff I need to order next week that ships in June of 2027. Is the tariff going to be 6%? Is it going to be zero? Is it going to be 100%? I have no idea.\n\nAs for the tariff costs small businesses have already paid, are we getting that back? Probably not. Are the corporations that paid the bulk of the tariffs going to be reimbursed? Where does that come from? I feel like this is just going to cause more paperwork, more red tape, more headaches. I don't know what the next step is.\n\nIf I could wave a magic wand, yes, there would be some reimbursement of the fees that all American businesses have had to pay. If I had to settle for something, it would be that, effective today, there are no more of these Trump tariffs.\n\nIt's hard to be excited about the Supreme Court ruling when, within hours, the White House says it's going to push back with more tariffs.\n\nThe administration is throwing so much at us every day that we can't make any progress. It's hard to see what the future will look like.\n\nI would hate to see this stretch on the next three years of the administration. It's going to take all this extra time that could be spent running our businesses and serving our customers, just trying to stop the government from getting its hands in our pockets.\n\nIt really feels like our elected officials are not listening to us. Historically, the Republican Party has been promoted as the party of business in the United States. If they truly were, they would be listening to constituents who are saying these tariffs are hurting our businesses.",

    "description": "A woman who worked as a manager in retail for over a decade took a leap of faith and retrained as an urban planner. Here's how she established credibility in a new field.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kate Portillo, 51, an urban planner who lives in Chicago. Her employment and education have been verified by Business Insider. This piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I decided to retrain as an urban planner at 41, I knew I was taking a leap of faith.\n\nAlthough I felt great about making the pivot, I was surprised by how difficult it was to establish credibility in a new field. I assumed that my years of management experience in retail would carry weight with most employers. In reality, I didn't feel that was the case.\n\nIn the end, changing careers in my 40s taught me a lot about starting again.\n\nAfter college, I worked with non-profits for a few years, then fell into a 13-year career in retail. My sister worked at Crate & Barrel and I saw the fun she had furnishing her home using her employee discount. She suggested I apply for a job.\n\nWithin a few weeks of being hired in 2002, at around age 25, I was put on the management track.\n\nOn a typical day, I'd work both back-of-house and front-of-house: managing teams and inventory, and tracking sales. I was trusted with significant responsibilities, from delivering bad news to customers to helping open new stores.\n\nIt was high-energy, fun, and I felt energized by how much the company cared about the customer experience.\n\nAround 2011, seven years into my retail career, I started thinking about what was next. There was a ceiling on earning potential as a store manager, and I wasn't sure how much longer the work would feel fulfilling.\n\nI considered getting a master's degree in business and attended a few university information sessions. The courses didn't resonate with me.\n\nAt the time, I volunteered on the board of the self-managed condominium where I lived. As part of major improvement projects, I navigated permitting processes and worked with contractors, designers, and architects. I really enjoyed it.\n\nI realized there was a career built around that kind of work. I attended an information session at the University of Illinois Chicago about the urban planning master's degree. I left fully confident that it was a good fit.\n\nAfter I was accepted on to the course and understood the level of commitment involved, I resigned from Crate & Barrel and began the program in 2016. I was 42, and both my kids were in elementary school.\n\nMy parents went back to school later in life — my father earned a master's degree in public health, and my mom earned one in education — and I think that inspired me. I was happy my own children would see that life is not static and that our callings can evolve over time.\n\nIn graduate school, I felt energized by the change. The courses stretched me outside my comfort zone, and I was learning new things.\n\nWhen I graduated in 2018, at 44, it stung that establishing myself in a new field was harder than expected. I didn't secure full-time employment for about a year after graduating, and filled my downtime with training, workshops, and internships.\n\nIn 2019, I got a job at a consulting firm, which involved staff augmentation. I'd sit at a desk in various municipalities, acting as their in-house staff. It made me realize that I really had a lot to offer.\n\nI loved the framework of municipal government work and, in 2022, I became an urban planner for a small community. I loved how hands-on it was and the feeling of seeing the fruits of my labor.\n\nIn 2024, I became a planning manager in Skokie, Illinois. In this role, my experience of managing teams and motivating people has come in handy. I work independently, make projects happen, but also need to mobilize people to get behind initiatives.\n\nFirst, don't get discouraged. Changing careers takes time and energy, but keep going.\n\nSecondly, prioritize networking. I'm involved with a professional development organization for women in planning and development. Networking doesn't have to be transactional; it can be about putting yourself out there and continuing to meet people until you establish some chemistry.\n\nFinally, seek out mentors. In past roles, more established women taught me, invited me to things, and folded me into their professional networks. That kind of organic network is really meaningful.\n\nWhen I first decided to pivot, it was pretty scary not knowing where I would ultimately land, but I have no regrets about where I have ended up.",

    "fullText": "It's a rare day when John Hussman, the legendary permabear who called the 2000 and 2008 crashes, expresses a degree of optimism about stocks.\n\nOne of those days came this week, however, when Hussman published his monthly market comment.\n\nThe president of the Hussman Investment Trust has been consistently bearish throughout the 2010s and 2020s, warning of potential drawdowns of 60% or more. While there have been rough patches for stocks during recent years — like the 35% S&P 500 COVID drawdown and the 25% decline amid the 2022 inflation surge — the market has repeatedly bounced back, posting huge cumulative gains.\n\nNow, the impressive returns appear to have Hussman readjusting his calculus — and his mindset.\n\nHussman said he expanded his investment parameters by reducing his downside hedges to allow for more upside potential, even during what he deems bubble periods, like today.\n\n\"I recently came to the realization that I've been discriminating against the bubble,\" Hussman wrote in his commentary titled \"How I Learned To Love the Bubble (Even Before it Bursts).\"\n\n\"Yes, we know that speculative bubbles can be filled with delusion, and their eventual collapse can cause a great deal of suffering, so when we see conditions that have inevitably led to that sort of outcome, it's natural to hope for — and look forward to — better investment conditions elsewhere, in the future,\" he wrote. \"But I decided we might be able to do better by finding and cultivating roses here and now, even amid what we are convinced is garbage.\"\n\nHussman has often warned over the last few years of \"trap door\" conditions, where extremely high valuations accompanied by deteriorating investor sentiment made it likely to see sharp downside in the near-term.\n\nHussman's preferred valuation model — the ratio of the total market cap of non-financial stock to the revenue of those stocks — is near all-time highs, beating peaks reached in 2021, 2000, and 1929.\n\nBut, increasingly, the market's best days have come during these periods, he said. Going back to the 1940s, the market's high-return days have come just 2% of the time amid poor conditions. Now, with valuations consistently high since 2020, they've come more frequently, and it's crucial to have exposure to them.\n\n\"Because 'trap door' conditions have been more frequent in recent years, these 'roses' appear in close to 15% of weekly periods during most recent 1-, 3-, and 5-year horizons,\" he wrote. \"Yet they easily account for more than half of the S&P 500 total return over these horizons.\"\n\nWhile Hussman may be a bit less bearish than he was before, he said not to anticipate a full-blown shift to the bullish side of the aisle.\n\n\"For anyone waiting for me to turn bullish as their signal to sell at the bubble highs,\" he wrote, \"I'll gently suggest that the title of this comment may be as much as you can ever hope to get.\"",

    "fullText": "Some gig workers say they're trying to log off apps like Uber and DoorDash for good.\n\nThe apps have long promoted themselves to gig workers as ways for workers to make money on their own schedule. Some, however, say that they're quitting the apps and looking for alternative side hustles — or finding full-time work, if they were full-time gig workers.\n\nJames Howe spent about two years working full-time as an Uber driver in the Denver area after losing his job. Initially, he said, he could work about 40 hours a week, accepting every trip that the Uber app offered him, and earn between $2,000 and $3,000 in gross pay, he told Business Insider.\n\nAs good-paying trips became more scarce in his area, though, Howe said that he started cherrypicking the most profitable ones, a strategy that involved a lot more unpaid time watching the Uber app for trip offers.\n\n\"You wound up spending a lot more time on the app, even though you weren't necessarily driving people,\" he said.\n\nLate last year, Howe took a full-time job in finance after one of his Uber passengers recommended him for the position. He hasn't driven for Uber since December.\n\nBesides working long hours, Howe said that he's worried about self-driving cars displacing human drivers. \"The future looks quite grim for them,\" he said.\n\nAbout 41% of Uber drivers who started working on the app between July and September 2025 were still completing trips on the app six months later, according to Gridwise, a data analytics company that analyzed app usage.\n\nEarlier data on people who began driving for Uber between January and April 2024 found that about 50% of workers were still using the app after six months. Lyft's retention rate, meanwhile, hovered around 40% in both data sets.\n\nAn Uber spokesperson told Business Insider said that the company \"saw historic low rates of driver churn in the US\" over the last year. Uber also pointed to a survey released last year that found 64% of its drivers reported being \"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\" with their experience on the app.\n\nStill, Ryan Green, CEO of Gridwise, said that many gig apps used to pay \n\nAt the same time, more people have turned to the gig apps to make money after layoffs or as the cost of living rises, making them more competitive, he said.\n\n\"The market's been oversupplied,\" he said.\n\nOne Uber driver in Atlanta, who relied on the app for income for a decade after losing her corporate job, told Business Insider this past fall that she was looking for other work options after her ride-hailing earnings fell.\n\nJustin Fisher, who works as a ride-hailing driver for Uber and delivers for DoorDash in Houston, said he's looking for other job opportunities after Uber temporarily deactivated his account for not completing an identity check through the app in time. Account deactivations are common for gig workers, and the companies don't always provide a clear reason.\n\nFisher, who worked in restaurant management before becoming a gig worker, said the deactivation highlighted the precarious nature of gig work.\n\n\"It's been making it very difficult for me to have a stable income, because I don't know for sure whether they're going to deactivate me,\" he said.\n\nFinding an alternative to gig work, especially a regular full-time job, isn't easy right now. Many workers who have quit their jobs or been laid off are facing long-term unemployment, even as they try to network and interview for a new role.\n\nOne Lyft driver in Florida pointed to another issue: Having gig work as the most recent work experience on your résumé can make landing a new role hard.\n\nThe driver, who has a bachelor's degree and ran his own marketing business before becoming a ride-hailing driver, said he thinks the year he's spent as a Lyft driver is one of the reasons most of his job applications don't lead to interviews.\n\n\"I'm very much considering taking Lyft off of my résumé,\" he said. \"But if I do that, that's going to show an enormous gap of employment that I'm going to need to explain.\"\n\n\"I don't know how I'm going to go about doing that,\" the driver said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "A solo founder used AI to vibe code her website, cut 60-minute tasks to one-minute, and scale her coaching business without hiring employees.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Christina Puder, a 35-year-old solo founder based in Madrid. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I took my side hustle full-time, I needed a website and accidentally fell into the world of building with AI.\n\nAfter trying an old website builder and failing, I hired a designer and an engineer part-time to do it. They were a bit slow, so while I was waiting, I tried using a suggested AI tool to build my website.\n\nI don't have funding or a technical background, so I made a free account with Lovable, an AI coding assistant. I started adding simple information about the website design, and all of a sudden, the AI platform built the entire landing page. That was my gateway into all the things AI can do.\n\nSometimes using AI feels like I'm working with the dumbest person I've ever met, but the word \"constraint\" very rarely enters my mind when I think about how AI is enabling me to run my business.\n\nFor about the last 10 years, I've been doing career coaching for product managers on the side of my full-time job. I went from zero clients to consistently having a full plate. In 2025, I decided to coach full-time.\n\nI knew I wanted to be bootstrapped, and hiring full-time employees was way too expensive. Part-time isn't ideal either because that's somebody who might not fully understand my business needs; it's not their main focus.\n\nBefore building my website, I was a casual AI user. I would go to ChatGPT for help with ideas, writing, and research. I don't have a background in tech, and because of that, I initially didn't think of AI as an enabler for my business. After building my website, I discovered how useful AI could be for both my webpage and the internal system of my business.\n\nWhen I tried building my website before using AI, I probably put in 30 or 40 hours, and it turned out so ugly and clunky. Then I started testing Loveable using five free credits a day. After seeing how fast the AI tool worked and how good it looked, I knew I'd be back the next day to keep building.\n\nWhen I first started using Lovable, I think the credits were correlated to the number of messages I sent. I discovered a hack after I sent a message with a single easy change request, and it cost me a credit. In the next message, I put six requests, and it did all six changes and only took one credit again.\n\nI think they've discovered that loophole. Now, credit usage seems more closely tied to the amount of power a request consumes. There are times I'm building, and I'm surprised because I won't realize I'm making such an expensive request.\n\nI'm not sure how many credits it took to build my whole website. It's definitely more than five, but someone could build a whole landing page with five credits. They could ask the AI tool to make a basic website with three sections and brand colors, and I think it would honestly only take two and a half credits.\n\nI switched to a paid account, and now I pay $20 a month for my subscription, which I don't think is that expensive. I get 100 credits a month, plus my five free credits every day that don't roll over.\n\nI've started to think of my AI tools as workers. I want to make sure I use them to their full capacity, which is why I always try to use the credits that don't roll over. It's the same as if I hired someone full-time: I'd want them to deliver high output every day.\n\nIf it's been a while since I've given my website backend some love, I'll write a prompt asking which areas of the code would most benefit from a refactor, and ask it to rank them. Then, based on how many of my five credits I have left, I'll tell it which areas to fix.\n\nOne service I offer is finding and applying to jobs for clients. Each client has very specific criteria for the kinds of jobs they want, and I would manually search for jobs that fit those criteria for each client.\n\nIt used to take me around 60 minutes a day per client just to manually find the right jobs to apply for. I built AI-driven automations that reduced search time to one minute. Getting 60 minutes a day back for each of my clients has been a massive scale unlock.\n\nI really didn't think it was possible.\n\nEvery once in a while, things break, or I hit bugs. There have been times when I'm building something, and I spend 40 credits trying to fix it. After a while, I'll ask the AI to completely remove the feature we're working on because we've hit a bug. I'll tell them that instead of continuing to try to dig our way out, we're just going to start from scratch.\n\nThere was once an issue with some logos on my website. I tried and tried to prompt it to make them all look the same size together, but it wouldn't do it. I eventually went back to my part-time engineer and asked them to fix it.\n\nEvery once in a while, I go back to that engineer and just pay him to fix one or two specific things that I can't get done.\n\nDo you have a story to share about running an AI-powered business?

    "fullText": "It takes airline pilots years to go from their first discovery flight to sitting in the cockpit of a commercial jetliner — and even then, the training never stops.\n\nMuch of a pilot's professional life is spent outside the cockpit in high-tech simulators that mimic real flights. These giant boxes mounted on hydraulic legs allow pilots to safely train for stalls, engine fires, and other emergency scenarios in a controlled environment.\n\nI recently flew an Airbus A350 simulator at Turkish Airlines' flight training center in Istanbul. With the help of Captain Fatih Altunok, the SVP of flight training, I navigated airports, severe weather, traffic conflicts, and turbulence, and practiced takeoffs, landings, and emergency scenarios.\n\nLike other major airlines worldwide, Turkish Airlines' pilot training program is built around international standards that require thousands of hours of flight time, regular medical exams, and recurrent simulator checks to expose them to rare but high-risk scenarios.\n\nAltunok said Turkish Airlines' over 5,000 pilots (including 320 foreign pilots from 58 countries) each spend months in initial training before flying passengers, and must complete four hours of simulator training every 6 months for recurrent training.\n\nUS regulators mandate recurrent simulator training for airline pilots every six to 12 months, typically in one or more four-hour blocks.\n\nAltunok said the flight simulator mirrors the exact configuration of a Turkish A350. I noticed that every switch, button, lever, screen, and alarm is carefully calibrated, and the legs tilt and lift the simulator to create lifelike movements throughout every phase of flight.\n\nThe wraparound screens were my only cue that it was fake. The visuals — simplified clouds, terrain, roads, buildings, and airports — aren't photo-realistic, though that's by design.\n\nThis imagery prioritizes stable frame rates and low latency while providing pilots with the critical visual cues needed to judge things like altitude, runway alignment, and weather.\n\nAltunok said the simulator's hydraulic system can't reproduce every sensation of flight, but it uses a combination of motion, visual, auditory, and tactile cues to trick the brain, from normal takeoffs, landings, and turbulence to more extreme maneuvers — including flipping the jet upside down, which he even demonstrated.\n\nThe simulator I used was one of about 30 in use, run by a team of about 650 instructors. They run seven days a week, 365 days a year. The airline said in 2025 alone, the simulators trained 7,500 pilots individually (some more than once) and collectively ran for 160,000 hours — or over 18 years.\n\nThese sessions let airlines regularly assess pilot proficiency and reinforce their safety culture, while crew can fine-tune their skills. Here's what it felt like to be at the controls.\n\nEven routine tasks revealed how technical the job is. Taxiing a half-million-pound plane from gate to runway requires constant adjustments, and the takeoff was more intense than I expected.\n\nI fly as a passenger at least twice a month, so I know the feeling of a jet barreling down the runway, but the simulated engines felt surprisingly loud and powerful in that training box.\n\nAltunok took the right seat and let me sit in the captain's position on the left, talking me through the takeoff. I felt the runway bumps and a brief G-force as we lifted off — though even in an A350, you pull back on the sidestick more gently than you'd think.\n\nOnce in the air, we flew a virtual circuit around Istanbul. The screens recreated the landscape below, letting me look down on the city and the Bosphorus Strait as if I were actually above it.\n\nI was given a very simple setup: just keep the plane on course using the sidestick while Altunok — who has flown Airbus and Boeing jets at Turkish Airlines for 20 years — handled the flaps, engine power, and the myriad other tasks required of the crew.\n\nHe eventually let autopilot take over. It was fun to watch the process and experience flying from a perspective that few travelers ever get.\n\nI noticed the muscle memory pilots must develop between actually flying the plane, quickly flipping to certain checklists, and reacting safely to sudden alerts and emergency situations.\n\nThe instructor, who sits behind the cockpit with their own computer setup, sent a few my way.\n\nI got a traffic alert that another plane came too close for comfort after takeoff. Sometimes this is just an alert; other times, the pilots are given a command to change altitude or adjust speed to avoid a collision.\n\nWhen we were returning to Istanbul Airport in rough weather — turbulence and all jolting the jet — a loud, red \"windshear\" alert blared in the cockpit. Windshear is a sudden change in wind speed or direction, often near the ground, that can cause a rapid loss of lift and has caused past plane crashes. Airbus makes the warning nearly impossible to miss.\n\nThis alert cues a go-around, and Altunok instructed me to push the engines to full throttle and climb away from the runway; I could feel the engines rev. Pilots must instinctively do this within just a few seconds, then reconfigure the aircraft and communicate with air traffic control for another landing attempt.\n\nSimulators also train pilots on automated systems. On one landing, Altunok set up and executed an auto-landing. Watching him manage it showed how pilots must prepare for low-visibility approaches and constantly monitor the technology.\n\nKnowing that turbulence often feels more intense than it actually is, I asked the instructor to show me what extreme turbulence would be like.\n\nI was bouncing in my seat, but it wasn't difficult to keep my hands steady on the controls. The autopilot helped keep the jet stable, and we weren't losing hundreds of feet of altitude with every bump, as some passengers fear.\n\nAltunok said that in turbulence, the pilots' main goal is to find smoother air — both to keep passengers comfortable and to avoid spilling coffee on their uniforms.\n\nThe rigorous simulator and overall training programs directly feed into the airline's safety record. Turkish Airlines was named the safest in Europe and the 12th safest globally for 2026 by the aviation ranking website AirlineRatings.\n\nThe list considers factors like the number of flights, fleet age, safety audits, turbulence prevention, and pilot training. The carrier hasn't had a crash in 17 years.",

    "description": "America's supply-chain bosses are experiencing a fresh bout of uncertainty after Friday's tariff ruling by the Supreme Court.",
    "fullText": "Friday's tariff ruling has once again put America's supply-chain bosses in a bind.\n\nMany made strategic changes after the levies were announced last year, and the new ruling — plus Trump's strong reaction to it — are now clouding their path forward. With the commander in chief fighting back, COOs must decide whether to proceed as if the court's decision is impenetrable or wait to see if the White House can successfully keep the tariffs intact.\n\n\"Tariffs are written in DC, and they're felt in the COO's inbox,\" Jason Schloetzer, a professor at Georgetown's McDonough School of Business, told Business Insider. \"It's kind of an impossible job.\"\n\nIn a news conference held shortly after the ruling, Trump lashed out at the court's justices who sided against him, saying they should be \"absolutely ashamed\" and accusing them, without evidence, of being \"swayed by foreign interests.\" He also said \"alternatives\" would be used to preserve his trade agenda and that he'd tap a separate authority to impose a 10% global tariff on top of existing tariffs.\n\n\"President Trump has been abundantly clear: Tariffs are here to stay, and the America Last era of American workers being ripped off is over,\" White House Spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. \"The Administration will be pursuing other legal authorities to maintain President Trump's America First trade and economic agenda while continuing to implement a pro-growth agenda of tax cuts, deregulation, and energy abundance.\"\n\nTrump's alternative was announced Friday night. Trump signed a proclamation that would implement a temporary 10% import surcharge for 150 days, starting on February 24, under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. The executive order also carved out exemptions for certain categories, including critical minerals and some agricultural products.\n\nAny strategies Trump deploys will likely face legal and other hurdles that could take months to resolve, said Schloetzer. In the meantime, \"COOs will just press the pause button\" on decisions involving sourcing, factory locations, labor, and other expenses, he added.\n\nMany companies are still grappling with the impact of actions they took last year to cope with Trump's tariff hikes, said Rob Lalka, who teaches entrepreneurship at Tulane University.\n\nFor example, he said that some companies responded by raising prices on consumer goods, which in turn affected people's spending habits and opinions of those businesses.\n\n\"That disruption is something you can't reverse,\" he said.\n\nNow, with the fate of Trump's tariffs up in the air, COOs are experiencing the kind of whiplash that can be debilitating, said Lalka, especially for those at startups and small businesses with limited resources.\n\n\"They're the ones who are often working with the thinnest margins,\" he said.\n\nFriday's ruling could also benefit companies financially through refunds. The Supreme Court ruled that the federal government illegally collected more than $133 billion in taxes from American businesses.\n\nYet while business groups such as the US Chamber of Commerce and the National Retail Federation hailed the court's decision, Trump administration officials have suggested that issuing refunds would be a messy process.\n\nFor now, the burden of figuring out how to keep operations humming will fall largely on COOs, said Schloetzer.\n\n\"CEOs can always focus on talking about long-term strategies, and CFOs can focus on modeling what these things might mean for margins,\" he said. \"But COOs actually have to be the ones in the short-term that are delivering.\"\n\nThose in manufacturing have it particularly bad, he added, because such companies may need to move components across multiple countries.\n\n\"It really is difficult to think through what the margin implications would be,\" said Schloetzer. \"They've got to just be pulling their hair out.\"\n\nBrian Smith, COO of Omni Containment Systems, an Elgin, Illinois, manufacturer of HVAC cleaning systems, is feeling the heat.\n\n\"It's very frustrating … because of the journey that we just went on for one year in altering our import-export strategies,\" he said.\n\nOmni, which imports goods from Spain and exports to Canada, lost sales last year due to the Trump administration's tariffs, Smith said. The company managed, however, and Smith said he thought \"things had kind of stabilized\" in recent months.\n\n\"This will take us right back to where we were in the first and second quarter of last year, which was complete uncertainty,\" he said.\n\nSmith added that it's hard to know how this will play out with suppliers and buyers.\n\n\"We're going to have to have some conversations with our larger customers who buy multiple machines and discuss what influence this is going to have,\" he said.\n\nAnother unknown he's wrestling with is whether a refund is headed Omni's way for the tariffs the company has paid to date.\n\n\"What are they going to do with all the money they collected?\" said Smith of the payments that the federal government illegally collected from US businesses, per the Supreme Court's decision. \"If they could just answer that question, it would be helpful either way.\"",

    "title": "3 reasons dire economic predictions about Trump's policies haven't played out, according to one think tank",
    "description": "According to new commentary from the Brookings Institution, there are a few major reasons that economists have been wrong on Trump's policies.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's economic policies have not led to the dire scenarios of recession or steep inflation that many economists have warned about over the last year. According to new commentary from the Brookings Institution, there are a few major reasons that economists have so far gotten it wrong.\n\nTrump has challenged the conventional economic norms in multiple ways that economists have warned would stress the system.\n\nTrump's tariffs were struck down by the Supreme Court on Friday, but experts spent the year leading up to the decision predicting dire consequences from the sweeping trade policy. For the most part, though, downbeat assessments of tariffs and other Trump policies haven't come to pass.\n\nTrump has used tariffs aggressively and cracked down on immigration, shrinking the labor force, yut the economy has mostly held strong with unemployment still historically low and consumers still spending. He's also tried to erode the Federal Reserve's independence and has added to the national debt with the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Interest rates haven't had a big reaction to either development, both of which could be viewed as inflationary.\n\nBen Harris, vice president and director of Economic Studies at Brookings, put out some explanations for the discrepancies this week.\n\nFirst, Brookings thinks everything has turned out better than some expected because the negative impacts of Trump's policies and actions were overestimated to begin with. The Fed is difficult to influence, tariffs aren't as steep as originally thought, and the pass-through to consumers has been smaller than expected.\n\n\"Perhaps mainstream economic models are simply wrong,\" Harris wrote. \"Is it possible the economics profession overstated the value of immigration, free trade, Fed independence, and a sustainable fiscal outlook?\"\n\n\"It's entirely possible that this volatile episode in American policymaking will lead to a greater understanding of the US economy,\" he continued. \"There could be one enduring lesson—learned both over the course of 2025 as well as during the pandemic—that the size and diversity of the U.S. economy usually protects it from sharp downturns.\"\n\nSecond is the positive fiscal impact of both the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — the GOP's landmark tax and spending bill — and of all the corporate spending on AI development. Harris pointed out that AI capex accounted for 40% of GDP in 2025; Goldman Sachs sees consumers' disposable incomes expanding by 0.4% in the first six months of 2026 thanks to the OBBBA; and foreign investors have pledged to spend billions of dollars in the US amid Trump's trade wars.\n\nThird and finally, Harris said we may not have seen the final impact of Trump's policies, and it's still too early to issue a verdict on them.\n\n\"This explanation is consistent with economic theory and evidence. The economic impact of curtailed immigration and mass deportations can take years to materialize,\" Harris wrote.\n\n\"The complexity of the FOMC's composition means that it may take years until we see the full impact of political influence,\" he added. \"And on tariffs, as we have heard from our western trading partners recently in Davos, only now have they begun to explore alternatives to the U.S. in terms of trade and investment decisions.\"",

    "description": "Although he never worked in Big Tech, Brian Jenney earned more than he ever imagined in software development using this salary negotiation strategy.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Brian Jenney, 42, who lives in California. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I got into tech in my early 30s, I had no clue how crazy lucrative the industry was.\n\nI started as a web application developer in 2015, earning roughly $60,000 a year.\n\nOver the years, I became savvier at negotiating my salary, and by 2023, I was making over $250,000.\n\nI've earned more than I could have ever imagined, without working in Big Tech, where people often assume the big money is made.\n\nHere's what I've learned along the way.\n\nI used to have addiction issues, so I didn't really work from the ages of 25 to 30 and lost knowledge that people gain from white collar jobs at this stage of life.\n\nI was naive about the salary potential of my industry, and when people in tech said they were on $150,000, it blew my mind, and I began to feel underpaid.\n\nIn 2017, after two years in the web developer role, I landed a job at a startup. I was so impressed when I was offered $120,000 that I didn't negotiate my salary, which was dumb in retrospect.\n\nThe environment was extremely fast-paced and high-caliber. I struggled with imposter syndrome as one of the team's more junior members. I felt like one of the worst developers there and that I was already being paid more than I deserved. It discouraged me from asking for a raise.\n\nIn 2019, I joined the media intelligence company Zignal Labs. I was so happy about the job offer that I didn't negotiate the salary, so my pay initially stayed roughly the same as in my previous job. It felt like I had plateaued, even though I had more money than I needed. An unfortunate symptom of working in tech is that you get drawn to wanting more.\n\nChoosing this role turned out to be the right move, though. I had more room to grow and was in a better learning environment at a larger company.\n\nDuring the tech hiring spree of 2020, my peers said they were getting crazy offers, and I didn't want to miss out. That August, I joined The Clorox Company, a manufacturing firm, as a software engineer. By 2023, I was making over $250,000: the peak of my earnings in tech.\n\nIn 2024, I was laid off, and I've continued to work in various software engineering roles. I bought a business in 2023, and my focus has shifted to seeking out flexibility and time to build it, instead of maximizing corporate compensation.\n\nInterviews are like a carnival game where you can win big money by performing well, and you can't get to the negotiation stage without passing them. They're structured, learnable, and winnable with the right preparation.\n\nWhen I have job interviews lined up, I do technical practice and use a platform called Pramp, which pairs you with strangers for practice interviews. I've found this helps simulate the nerves and pressure of real interviews better than practicing with friends.\n\nI'll try to do at least two mock interviews before an interview I really care about.\n\nOver the years, I've benefited a lot from people in tech being open about their salaries and career paths, which helped me understand what was possible and gave me confidence to negotiate and aim higher.\n\nI've learned that salary negotiation is a game you have to play, and if you don't, you lose money.\n\nI began consistently negotiating pay in the late 2010s. I usually tell the employer that I'm really excited to start the job, but that I was hoping to come in at a higher salary range, usually 10 to 20% more.\n\nI've found this to be very effective, and it has never gone badly for me. If an employer sounds firm on their offer, I usually try to explore whether a sign-on bonus is possible instead, but I don't push aggressively beyond that.\n\nI've interviewed with but never been hired by the Big Tech companies. Besides, I like working at smaller startups and non-tech companies where I think you can have a greater impact.\n\nBig Tech employees are going to \"beat me\" on pay because their stock compensation will outpace my earnings. But I see my current lifestyle as comparable to theirs. I believe there's a reason software engineers aren't driving around Mountain View in Ferraris: they can't cash out all their stock money yet.\n\nThere's always more you can earn, but when my salary hit the $150,000 mark, I knew it was more than I needed. I'd rather prioritize jobs where I'm happy, I'm learning, and I can cover my needs while still saving. That's all I really need.\n\nDo you have a story to share about growing your salary in tech?

    "description": "Amid rising US healthcare costs, Cara West found relief in medical tourism. Her family saved thousands getting tests and scans done in Turkey.",
    "fullText": "Cara West had never seen such a gorgeous hospital.\n\nThe 34-year-old is traveling the world with her husband and toddler and often seeks medical care abroad rather than in their hometown of Austin, Texas. Last summer, they flew to Istanbul for a primary care check-up. They stayed at a hotel, boarded the morning shuttle arranged by their medical tourism agency, and began a full-day itinerary.\n\nEach family member received bloodwork, scans, an EKG, and doctor consultations over the next few hours. West's daughter even got her eyes checked. As a midday break, they ordered lunch at the hospital's restaurant, complete with a menu featuring items like veggie omelettes and raspberry cheesecake. It all felt \"luxurious.\"\n\nWhen the bill came, the total was $1,330 before insurance — and West is still in shock.\n\n\"There's this fear as an American because you know that medicine is so expensive and it's confusing,\" West said. She estimates the same check-ups would have cost her family thousands \n\nAs healthcare prices climb in the US, Americans are looking for ways to cut costs. To avoid breaking the bank, more people are turning toward medical tourism. Some foreign hospitals — especially in places like Turkey — are even marketing themselves directly to American patients.\n\nData on the phenomenon is limited, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that millions of Americans seek healthcare abroad each year, most commonly in Mexico, Canada, and the Caribbean. The market for international health insurance is expected to grow from nearly $32 billion in 2025 to $40 billion in 2030, and North Americans account for the largest share. Patients travel for a range of services, including cosmetic surgeries, reproductive procedures like IVF, and cancer care.\n\nWest and her husband first considered living abroad after the birth of their daughter in 2022. They were paying off expensive labor and delivery bills, and craving a more travel-oriented lifestyle. Temporarily relocating to a lower-cost-of-living city seemed like the perfect solution.\n\nWest was working remotely for a startup, and her husband took a break from his job as a restaurant manager. With a combined six-figure income, they had been living nearly paycheck to paycheck in Austin — but one salary was more than enough to comfortably afford life in Lisbon. They stayed for three months as part of a program for people interested in traveling and living abroad.\n\nIt was around this time that the family enrolled in an international healthcare plan. Their US employer-sponsored plans had become unaffordable and didn't meet their growing healthcare requirements while abroad, West said. They began regularly traveling overseas and wanted to ensure they could still easily fill prescriptions and visit urgent care when needed.\n\nWest enrolled in the international healthcare plan Genki, which covers doctor visits and hospital stays for travelers and digital nomads in most countries. It costs $657 a month for the family, but she said she was paying nearly twice that in Texas with much higher deductibles. The deductible for international coverage is $1,000, though West said, \"It's actually kind of hard to meet that, because the cost of medical care is actually very affordable.\"\n\nBesides the Istanbul hospital, the family has received medical care in Portugal and Greece. West said all were covered by her international plan. She advised others interested in medical tourism to read reviews, reach out to hospitals directly with questions, and try a video chat with providers first before visiting in person.\n\n\"I think a lot of people feel really uneasy because they think, 'I'm going to a foreign country, I'm going to get medical care. And what happens if something goes wrong?'\" she said. \"Honestly, it really is all about doing your research.\"\n\nWest's family recently settled on the Greek island, Syros. They love the sunshine and close-knit community, and their move from Texas is likely permanent. Cheaper healthcare costs are a main reason for their decision.\n\nAs an added bonus, West said the island is a Blue Zone. She hopes it's good news for their longevity.\n\n\"I've started learning from the older generation here,\" she said. \"All of the things that they do, and what they believe is keeping them healthy and young.\"",

    "description": "A 3D scan showed me that I improved my mobility in five months by taking sporadic reformer Pilates classes.",
    "fullText": "I got a 3D scan that measured my flexibility last August, hoping the predictably subpar results would finally inspire me to stretch more.\n\nEven knowing my shoulder rotation movement was in the \"red\" zone — needing serious improvement if I wanted to avoid future pain — it wasn't enough to get me to devote three minutes of light stretching before my cardio and strength workouts as suggested by trainers I had spoken with.\n\nThe only thing I changed about my routine was signing up for two reformer Pilates classes a month, motivated solely by wanting to join my friends. (I never went more than that because I could only stand to feel embarrassed by my winded lunging twice a month.)\n\nSo when I got re-scanned nearly half a year later, I wasn't exactly expecting miraculous results. When Donovan Stewart, the Life Time trainer who conducted my first scan, said it'd be a good idea to do another one to see my biggest pain points, I dreaded the moment he summoned me over to review the results.\n\n\"You've improved since last time,\" he said. \"By 13 points.\"\n\nI was now in an overall \"good\" mobility range, with improvements in every area and nothing in the red zone. I guess even the bare minimum of mobility work could make an enormous difference in my overall health.\n\nPilates is a full-body workout, developed by Joseph Pilates during World War I, that uses controlled movements to enhance core strength, breathing techniques, and balance.\n\nIt has direct flexibility benefits because it prioritizes hip mobility, core strength, and shoulder engagement. I noticed that my body felt more sore after one reformer Pilates class than after any other workout I had tried.\n\nIf gingerly lowering myself to my seat the next day was any indication, I was activating new muscle groups.\n\nMy trainer used Kinotek, launched in 2022 as a standardized movement assessment that scans the body to detect range of motion. It uses 3D visuals to highlight issues such as asymmetry or excessive flexibility, which can destabilize joints.\n\nCompetitors DARI Motion and Kinetisense offer similar services with their FDA-cleared medical motion-analysis devices. (Kinotek is registered with the FDA, which means that the company can sell its product in the US, but hasn't been officially reviewed by the agency.)\n\nAccording to my latest scan, my biggest improvements were in my shoulder movements and my squat:\n\nWhen I told Stewart that the only thing I did was the occasional Pilates class, he wasn't surprised. Even though I wasn't super consistent, he said, I was increasing my \"body awareness\" — getting myself in the habit of even noticing my body's stiffness in the first place.\n\nReformer Pilates, which incorporates machinery for deeper stretches, made me realize how tight my hips and shoulders felt. Originating as an apparatus to help wounded WWI soldiers exercise while lying down, the Reformer machine evolved in the US throughout the 20th century, eventually being adapted by dancers and athletes.\n\nEquipped with straps and springs of varying resistance, the machines helped me stretch deeper than before. The light cracking sound from my hips when I lengthened into a wide stretch was like the opening of an ancient crypt. I became obsessed with that feeling. Before class began, I started putting my legs into the straps and stretching myself out on my own.\n\nWhen I was at home, I began sitting on the couch differently, putting my feet together and pushing my knees apart to open my hips more. I also felt a little more aware of when I was slouching over my laptop, self-correcting and trying to sit up straighter when I caught it.\n\nWhile spontaneous Pilates classes are better than none, Stewart recommended going to them once a week to \"yield amazing results for mobility and, of course, body awareness.\" Even though I improved, I was still very uneven in my leg hurdles — something Pilates could improve by individually strengthening both sides of my body.\n\nAs someone who really struggles with pre-workout stretching (it's just so boring!), it's nice to know that mobility isn't an all-or-nothing endeavor. I don't have to choose between completely neglecting stretching and doing it every day to be more flexible.\n\nMore importantly, I don't have to view mobility as a chore; I can pick more fun options, like a pop playlist-enhanced Pilates class. Sometimes the biggest changes happen when you're too engrossed in a bridge pose to notice.",

    "title": "Supplements are the new obsession, even as doctors stay wary. I went inside one of the industry's biggest factories.",
    "description": "Business Insider visited Thorne's supplement factory where creatine, electrolytes, and magnesium were being tested and shipped.",
    "fullText": "As soon as I stepped inside the supplement factory, the sweet smell of red berries filled the air. It reminded me of being a kid and gorging on chewable multivitamins — a not-quite-natural \"mixed berry\" scent that was both nostalgic and vaguely medicinal. As factory tour smells go, it could have been much worse.\n\nInside Thorne's headquarters, raw materials from around the world were arriving by the pallet. Under the neon lights of a giant, temperature-controlled warehouse outside Charleston, South Carolina, forklifts hummed and beeped as they stacked ingredients on towering shelves.\n\nIn here, it's always 70 degrees and dialed in to a moderate 60% humidity level. The relief stepping in from the muggy southern heat outside was immediate.\n\nI saw pallets of creatine monohydrate, long popular with bodybuilders for improving strength, speed, and recovery. Indian barberry — the source of berberine, which influencers sometimes call \"nature's Ozempic\" — was also being stocked. (It's not actually comparable to GLP-1 drugs.) Flavoring agents destined to become mango limeade or blood orange electrolytes sat quarantined until they could be cleared for use. Workers in full-body suits moved between sealed mixing rooms where air pressure kept outside dust out. No perfume. No open-toed shoes. No mistakes.\n\nFacilities like this one are increasingly common. The supplement industry has been quietly expanding its manufacturing footprint across the US, racing to meet demand that surged during the pandemic and has never slowed. Thorne's newest warehouse, which opened in 2023 and doubled its manufacturing capacity to 549,000 square feet — about six football fields — is a monument to the supplement boom. The company poured $35 million into expansion after moving from a small-town Idaho factory to this suburban South Carolina location.\n\nConsumers are clamoring for supplements and daily powders, fueled by influencers, personalized medicine, and a fast-growing online market for both peptides and supplements that's racing ahead of regulation and bypassing doctors' recommendations. The doctors and experts I've spoken with don't dismiss supplements outright, but they warn the market is a minefield — one that patients are navigating largely on their own.\n\nThe global supplement market is now estimated at $100 to $200 billion and is growing rapidly, with the US accounting for about one-fifth of worldwide demand. Once considered to exist only on the fringes of medical care, \"stacks\" of supplements have now become daily rituals for millions of Americans.\n\nBefore the pandemic, around 58% of US adults reported taking some kind of supplement. Today, that number is closer to 75%, according to industry estimates. Online sales are taking over. The Nutrition Business Journal's 2025 report cited annual growth of over 10% in online supplement sales, even as other pandemic-era e-commerce trends have cooled.\n\n\"It's just been an explosion of people being like, 'I should probably pay attention to my health a little bit more and think about it proactively and take it a little more into my own hands,'\" Nathan Price, Thorne's chief science officer, told Business Insider from his office near Silicon Valley.\n\nThe pandemic didn't just trigger interest in immunity-boosting and hygiene; it fundamentally changed how people think about their health and what they can do to improve it. Wellness culture — especially nutrition, fitness, and longevity — moved from the margins to the mainstream.\n\nThere are many reasons for this shift. A bloated American \"sick care\" system that no one feels is working well. Growing distrust of one-size-fits-all medical advice. Doctors pressed for time with patients. The rise of direct-to-consumer lab tests that sample blood, spit, urine, and other substances from the body, promising to tell you exactly which pills, potions, and microbiome supplies you need to feel your best.\n\nI'm not immune to the trend. About a year and a half ago, I did some testing at a high-end longevity clinic as part of a reporting trip and discovered I was magnesium-deficient. Now, I take a pill or two every day — not because a doctor prescribed it, but because a gargantuan 12-vial blood test led me to understand that it would be a good idea.\n\nOther than a little increase in morning (ahem) regularity, I don't notice much difference, but my levels are back in range — which suggests it's doing something, even if I can't feel it. My doctor said she thought my dosage seemed a little high, but shrugged it off and said, \"If you want to, it's fine,\" given my normal-looking bloodwork.\n\nA decade ago, there was no way to get Thorne's supplements outside a doctor or healthcare practitioner. Today, consumers are no longer content with a one-size-fits-all multivitamin. Many track their sleep, heart rate, and workouts on smart devices, then feed that data into apps or AI tools to create personalized supplement \"stacks.\" Podcasts and influencers amplify new studies — sometimes responsibly, sometimes not.\n\nNow that you can get the product with just a tap of your smartphone, Thorne's marketing has followed suit. Whether it's sports, beauty, or wellness, there's a good chance someone you follow has touted a Thorne supplement. Model Karlie Kloss, tennis player Ben Shelton, Chris Hemsworth's trainer, Da Rulk, Dwayne Wade, and Ciara have all been featured in ads or promoted the brand on social media.\n\nThis is not the same company that founder Al Czap started in 1984. A former supplement salesman, he started the company after seeing the poor state of industry manufacturing standards. He thought there were too many additives, too many hidden ingredients, too much messy manufacturing, creating ineffective, or worse, dangerous products.\n\nSo, he started to make his own. He built a successful business selling directly to doctors, bypassing stores and advertising entirely, establishing a brand based on quality and clean manufacturing.\n\n\"I was dealing with physicians who knew nutritional medicine, and they would bring the patient in, and they would look at their blood pattern. They would look at doing urinalysis. They would get the symptoms, and they would say, 'Alright, I've had success with this product, and I would like you to take this product,'\" Czap told me about the early days of Thorne.\n\nCzap stepped down as CEO in 2010, and after that, the company went through a period of rapid commercialization and expansion, first with Czap remaining as a shareholder and consultant, and later with private equity firm L Catterton taking full control. Over the years, Thorne developed flashier packaging, built an online presence, and launched consumer-facing blogs before starting to sell directly to consumers in 2018. They didn't know it then, but soon they'd be in prime position to ship out supplements directly to consumers during the pandemic. A highly absorbable form of zinc, called zinc picolinate, was Thorne's big seller during lockdown, as shoppers scrambled to pick up anything that might boost their immunity.\n\nSome of the biggest names in the wellness space, including controversial wellness giants Andrew Huberman and Peter Attia, have mentioned Thorne by name, noting the brand's reputation for quality, even though Thorne is far from the largest player in the game. It's dwarfed by supplement giants including Nature Made, Nature's Bounty, Nestlé's Garden of Life, and Bayer's One A Day.\n\nInfluencer endorsements are big, especially in supplements, where it's nearly impossible to know exactly what you're getting. Unlike pharmaceuticals, supplements are not approved by the FDA before they hit shelves.\n\nUnder a 1994 law, manufacturers are largely responsible for ensuring their own products are safe and accurately labeled. The FDA does show up to inspect supplement makers — Thorne is quick to point this out — but those inspections aren't mandatory or regularly scheduled, they're mere retroactive checks on manufacturing and labeling. That regulatory gap has allowed innovation to flourish. It has also led to mislabeling, contamination, and exaggerated claims across the industry. Sometimes, the FDA only shows up after people complain about a brand or get sick.\n\nThis is where Thorne says it's eager to differentiate itself. Every product at the factory undergoes four rounds of testing, they say again and again. During my tour, I see miniature metal detectors screening raw materials and finished capsules coming off the line, checking repeatedly for heavy metals inside the pills. Refrigerators and heaters churn with finished pill bottles inside, testing to ensure the finished products remain stable across various climates. I'm introduced to lab workers in white coats and goggles who are uncapping products and spooning out scoops of powder to test for microbial contamination and potency.\n\nAt times, it feels excessive, but in an industry where trust is fragile, that redundancy is part of the brand ethos, Price said.\n\n\"We position as a premium brand, but to maintain that reputation, we're very strict,\" he added. \"The fact that we do [test] repeatedly just draws the probability of us having a negative to be very, very small. It's a trade-off.\"\n\nWhen I asked about his thoughts on the company's current standards, Czap is pleased that quality control remains paramount. \"Kudos to them because they didn't screw it up,\" he told me, adding he still gets his own supplements from Thorne.\n\nIt seems customers are taking notice, too. One of Thorne's most popular products, creatine, had more than 12,700 5-star reviews on Amazon at the time of publication, with hundreds of customers commenting on its high quality and dissolvability.\n\nEven if a product is safe, some consumers will overdo it. A woman in New Jersey, seeking inflammation and joint pain relief, recently suffered liver damage after she followed the advice of a person who said they were a doctor on social media and recommended a monster 10x dose of turmeric every day. (It's not clear what brand of turmeric supplement she was using.)\n\nOn top of consumer misuse, numerous studies show that most supplements don't accurately contain what they say on the label. Certain additives deemed \"incidental\" may not be listed at all. The FDA has even found prescription drugs like blood thinners, typically used to help prevent strokes and heart attacks, and anticonvulsants, prescribed for seizures and neuropathic pain, masquerading as \"supplements.\" It's a mess.\n\nThe doctors and longevity experts I've spoken with aren't categorically opposed to supplements. Still, many resent what a minefield it can be picking out the right products for the right person. Most agree that consumers shouldn't do this on their own, with no guardrails.\n\n\"I struggle with the supplement industry, not because I don't believe that some supplements have value, some certainly do, but I just feel like the incentive structures are all geared toward forcing companies, individuals, people in that industry who are marketing supplements to be dishonest,\" said Matt Kaeberlein, a scientist who studies the biological mechanisms of aging, and who recently cofounded Optispan, a longevity healthcare company.\n\nDr. Haleem Mohammed, the Chief Medical Officer at Gameday Men's Health, where he focuses on hormonal health, said he often sees patients get \"burned\" by inflated influencer claims on social media.\n\n\"The supplement brands and supplement shillers and influencers can make any sort of claims they want, whether it's performance, fat loss, libido,\" he said. \"They're not formulating, testing, verifying anything. They're out there cherry-picking studies. They're using animal data that's stretched into human claims.\"\n\nThere's one supplement, in particular, that's now a bestseller across demographics. Inside Thorne's facility, creatine is everywhere. Arriving by the pallet and showing up in cart after cart, being prepared to ship to a customer's doorstep.\n\n\"Creatine is the overnight sensation, even though it's been around forever,\" said Ken Rowe, Thorne's chief R&D officer, and a former VP at Nestlé.\n\nOnce a staple in gym lockers, it's now gaining steam as a longevity aid, cognitive enhancer, and everyday health hack. It's one of the most well-studied supplements, with decades of research — something supplement proponents, like Price, are keen to mention.\n\n\"There's some evidence now that 5 grams kind of saturates up your muscles, but if you go to 10 grams, there's this notion that some of that overflow actually goes into the brain,\" Price said.\n\nPeople are especially thrilled by a 20-person study with no placebo arm. It was designed to test safety, not efficacy, though it showed marginal benefits that still need confirmation in larger, placebo-controlled trials. Already, word has traveled that it works.\n\n\"I'm looking at an article online right now: 'Creatine shows potential to boost cognition.' That's not what they were saying,\" Dr. Nathaniel Chin, medical director for the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, said. \"They were just saying, 'This is feasible. People could take this. We should study this. We should see if this helps people in the long run,' which I'm excited about.\"\n\nNearby, in Thorne's testing labs, new flavors and formulations are already in development. Before we can lift the camera to take photos, workers quickly flip the labels on jars so we can't see the names of these not-yet-for-sale products, including two flavored versions of Thorne's creatine that it has since released: strawberry and pineapple-orange.\n\nCreatine is the industry standout star for now — with a forecasted compound annual growth rate of around 20-30% in the US — but it's not the only one. Women's health, gut health, and sports performance are Thorne's biggest categories, Rowe said.\n\nMagnesium, fish oil, curcumin (the anti-inflammatory compound in turmeric), prenatal vitamins, CoQ10, they are all here, buoyed by TikTok trends, podcast endorsements, and a broad obsession with longevity and performance.\n\nThere's a new \"advanced testosterone support\" product made with ashwaganda, jumping into the hype around hormone health. \"Even if people come in for creatine, then they find something else,\" Rowe said.\n\nDoctors fear many patients are overdoing it in this DIY-your-stack world. There's little concern for how these ingredients might interact with or counteract one another, or a prescription medication.\n\nLongevity experts and medical professionals recommend a more targeted approach to supplementation. Skip the blends and green powders, they say. Test for what you're deficient in, then add in supplements slowly, discuss your progress with your doctor, retest, and see how you feel along the way.\n\n\"If you're not testing before you're taking these supplements, you may just be taking expensive pee, especially when it's water-soluble vitamins,\" Mohammed, the men's health practitioner, said.\n\nBased on his own lab work and expertise, his current \"stack\" includes creatine, fish oil, Omega-3s, CoQ10, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and vitamin D.\n\n\"A lot of times, patients are deficient in those,\" he said. \"But I believe in testing for those before you just start willy-nilly telling people, 'Hey, take a multivitamin.'\"\n\nIf you're going to do one thing for your longevity, doctors consistently say to prioritize exercise. Then start incorporating fresh, nutrient-dense foods like vegetables and fish into your diet before taking pills.\n\n\"If you would spend this money on a gym that you thought would get you moving, I would rather that,\" Chin said.\n\nAs a perk, Thorne workers get to take home the supplements they make — with a monthly allotment of products, free of charge. The idea is that this is great quality control. Amy Caplette, Thorne's SVP of Quality & Regulatory Affairs, told me that if it's not good enough to serve your family, it shouldn't be coming off the line.\n\n\"Rather than suggesting a standard 'stack,' we encourage employees to make informed choices based on their own goals, lifestyles, and health considerations, with expert support available when helpful,\" the company said in a statement to Business Insider, after our tour.\n\nDoctors say that while that's probably not an unsafe strategy, it's not exactly optimal in a sector where influencers are often the loudest voices.\n\n\"It always comes back to the influencers and these certain celebrity doctors saying that traditional medicine has abandoned you. We have the solution,\" Mohammed said.\n\nChin said he understands the impulse to boost. He throws a little turmeric in his morning coffee, thinking of it as a mild anti-inflammatory. He pops a multivitamin, hoping to refill any dietary deficiencies.\n\nI left the factory with some creatine samples, plus a berry-flavored amino acid powder, and electrolyte packets. The electrolytes were delicious, and I quickly reached for them on hot, busy days when I felt my hydration lagging.\n\nBut the other supplements have been sitting in the kitchen pantry ever since. Do I really need them? Would daily creatine help, or would it just make my muscles a little rounder? It all feels so marginal. For now, I'll stick to working out.",

    "description": "The rule, which tax experts have nicknamed the \"marital loophole,\" allows qualifying investors to use real estate losses to offset W-2 income.",
    "fullText": "For years, Dr. Jill Green watched a large chunk of her physician's salary eaten up by taxes.\n\n\"I was paying a ton in taxes and still writing a check for a hefty five-figure amount every year,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nWhen she and her husband started investing in real estate about six years ago to create an additional revenue stream, she learned about a little-known IRS designation called real estate professional status, or REPS.\n\nIt's a strategy some tax experts have nicknamed the \"marital loophole.\"\n\nThe rule allows qualifying investors to use real estate losses to offset W-2 income, something most high earners can't typically do.\n\nHere's how Green and other couples are using it to significantly shrink their tax bills while growing their rental portfolios.\n\nUnder normal IRS rules, rental real estate is considered a passive activity. That means rental losses can offset rental income, but they cannot offset W-2 income, such as a physician's or accountant's salary.\n\nSo if you're a doctor earning $250,000 and your rental property shows a $150,000 loss on paper, you're still taxed on the full $250,000.\n\nThere is one small exception: a $25,000 \"special allowance\" for long-term rental losses, but it phases out between $100,000 and $150,000 of income and disappears entirely above $150,000.\n\nFor high-income earners, that benefit isn't an option. If you're making over $150,000 and you want to use rental losses to offset W-2 income, either you have to be a real estate professional, or you have to be married to one.\n\nThat's where the \"marital loophole\" comes in.\n\nIf one spouse qualifies as a \"real estate professional,\" rental losses are no longer treated as passive. They become active losses, meaning they can offset active income, including W-2 wages.\n\n\"You could continue to have your high W-2 income,\" CPA and real estate investor Amanda Han said, \"as long as your spouse is a real estate professional, then the rental losses can offset both of your incomes.\"\n\nLetizia Alto and Kenji Asakura, both physicians who later scaled back their hospital work after building a large rental portfolio, said they used this strategy to \"zero out\" their income taxes for seven years and accelerate their path to financial independence.\n\nThe strategy hinges on generating tax losses, not necessarily losing money.\n\nIt's common in real estate to produce positive cash flow while showing a loss on your tax return. That's largely because of depreciation, a non-cash deduction that allows owners to write off a portion of a building's value each year, as well as deductible expenses like renovations.\n\nThe year Asakura qualified for REPS, the couple leaned into upgrades. On paper, those renovation costs — combined with depreciation — helped generate sizable losses. At the same time, the improvements increased the properties' value and allowed them to raise rents. So, they were improving their portfolio and boosting cash flow while creating paper losses that could offset their physician income.\n\nYou don't apply for REPS. You qualify based on how you spend your time.\n\nTwo main requirements must be met:\n\n\"You can't be an attorney working 80 hours a week and then claim REPS,\" said Green. \"That means you have to be working a minimum of 160 hours in real estate.\"\n\nShe still works full time as a physician, while her husband, who builds custom closets and garages and manages their real estate portfolio, qualifies. \"His work was already considered REPS hours,\" she explained.\n\nDocumenting your hours is critical. CPA Kristel Espinosa warns that REPS can be closely scrutinized by the IRS.\n\n\"You can have other jobs, but you just have to be able to show that to the IRS if ever audited that the real-estate business really is your main thing,\" she said.\n\nAsakura logs his hours in a Google Calendar with detailed notes, everything from property visits to replacing an air conditioner.\n\nIf neither spouse can qualify for REPS, or if you're a single household that doesn't qualify, there's another strategy known as the \"short-term rental tax loophole.\"\n\nThe IRS treats short-term rentals (where the average guest stay is seven days or fewer) differently. If the owner materially participates in managing the property, losses may be used to offset W-2 income, even without REPS.\n\nTo qualify, investors must meet one of several material participation requirements. The most common are:\n\nFor example, if an investor spends 80 hours managing a short-term rental and cleaners and landscapers spend 50 hours total, the investor may still qualify under the \"more than everyone else combined\" test.\n\nHan gives the example of someone earning $500,000 a year in W-2 income.\n\n\"If you invest in a long-term rental and you can't use it to offset the tax, then maybe you're paying 37% taxes on it,\" she explained. However, if you turn that property into a short-term rental and generate a $200,000 tax loss, \"that offsets your W-2, so maybe you're saving $74,000 in taxes.\"\n\nUnlike the $25,000 long-term rental allowance, this strategy has no income cap.\n\n\"For people with lower income, it's even more impactful,\" Han said. \"If you make $1 million and you save some tax, great. It's not life-changing. But if you're making $80,000 and you save a significant amount in taxes, that's a lot more money to invest for that specific taxpayer.\"",

There's too much money to be made, and it's too productive. It's here.\"\n\nHe and Chalamet spoke about AI in the entertainment industry with students at the University of Texas at Austin during a CNN and Variety Town Hall event. The town hall will air on Saturday at 7 p.m. ET on CNN.\n\nDuring the conversation, McConaughey urged students to pursue legal protections for their likeness.\n\n\"I say, own yourself, voice, likeness, etc. Trademark it!\" he said.\n\nMcConaughey said doing so will give people more control over their branding and the opportunity to receive fair compensation.\n\n\"So, when it comes — not if it comes — no one can steal you,\" McConaughey said. \"They're going to have to come to you and go, 'Can I?' Or, they're going to be in breach. And you'll have the chance to be your own agency and go, \"yeah, for this amount,\" or 'no.'\"\n\nFor his part, McConaughey has already taken precautions.\n\nThe \"Interstellar\" actor had eight trademark applications approved over the last several months, according to The Wall Street Journal. That included his iconic \"Dazed and Confused\" catchline, \"alright, alright, alright!\"\n\n\"My team and I want to know that when my voice or likeness is ever used, it's because I approved and signed off on it,\" McConaughey told the Journal. \"We want to create a clear perimeter around ownership with consent and attribution the norm in an AI world.\"\n\nAn attorney for McConaughey added, \"In a world where we're watching everybody scramble to figure out what to do about AI misuse, we have a tool now to stop someone in their tracks or take them to federal court.\"\n\nMcConaughey is also an investor in Eleven Labs, an AI-powered voice generation platform.

Pre-owned watch retailer SwissWatchExpo CEO Eugene Tutunikov said it would likely lead to lower pre-owned watch prices in the next six months — he expects declines of 2% to 3%. Without tariffs looming overhead, the market is poised to snap back faster than retail prices as sellers set their prices and buyers take the deals.\n\n\"Supply will loosen up, and purchasing power goes right back to the collector where it belongs,\" Tutunikov said.\n\nA break from tariffs would make the entry point for luxury watch collecting more accessible.\n\nCue the celebrations among Swiss watch lovers who've been caught in a storm of retail price increases from leading brands like Rolex over the past year. Supply chain constraints also made it harder to do business in the secondhand market.\n\nTariff tensions between Switzerland and the US have been up and down since Trump's Liberation Day. US imports of Swiss goods faced a baseline tariff of 10% from April 2025 until Trump eventually raised it to 39%, sending shockwaves through the watch industry. The two countries continued negotiations until Trump agreed to lower the rate to 15% after speaking with Rolex and other Swiss companies.\n\nTrump clapped back at the nation's highest court over its Friday ruling, saying he'd find alternative ways to keep his trade agenda intact.\n\n\"The Supreme Court did not overrule tariffs. They merely overruled a particular use of IEPPA tariffs,\" Trump said, citing the law referenced in the court's ruling.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court's move is still a win in the books of watch dealers who've said the decision would allow pricing in the pre-owned market to return to being based on value and demand rather than tariffs.\n\n\"If they are indeed lifted, we expect it would meaningfully improve sentiment across the industry, increase access to important pieces, and ultimately benefit collectors, retailers, and brands alike,\" said Joshua Ganjei, CEO of European Watch Company, which sells pre-owned and vintage watches.",

    "fullText": "Ireland wing Rob Baloucoune said he will \"take every opportunity\" after his \"surprise\" involvement in the squad ahead of the match against England (14:10 GMT).\n\nBaloucoune had not featured for Ireland since November 2022 due to injury before starting and scoring against Italy in last week's Six Nations action.\n\nThe wing only played twice for Ulster last season after an injury-impacted year and missed this season's opener due to an ankle injury.\n\nSince returning, he has been in great form and has made a huge impact during Ulster's promising United Rugby Championship [URC] season so far.\n\n\"To be honest, yeah probably,\" Baloucoune replied when asked if he thought he might not get another opportunity to play at international level.\n\n\"It had been a while and playing for Ulster even looked a bit dreadful. I got a good run of games this season, was playing well and the team were playing well which helped my ability to get back into the game and scoring tries always helps.\n\n\"I was surprised to be in camp so I took the opportunity to play the game [against Italy] and I will take every opportunity I can get.\"\n\nLast campaign, Baloucoune returned from a long-term hamstring injury in March before suffering another set-back shortly after, which sidelined him until October.\n\nSince his comeback, he has registered six tries for Richie Murphy's side, who sit fourth in the URC.\n\n\"Last year was probably my toughest year, I had quite a number of big setbacks,\" he continued.\n\n\"I had a couple times nearly come back playing and then got pushed back. I had injuries over the years and I try to get back to as fit as I can. I try to focus on parts of my game, like handling, that I can try improve when injured.\n\n\"It can be tough, but I try set markers for where I want to be and I feel like if you have a goal in place, you can always track it and get back into it.\"\n\nAs well as balancing playing for Ulster and Ireland, Baloucoune has also taken up a new role as a coach at Enniskillen Rugby Club.\n\nThe 28-year-old helps with the backs and believes his new role has improved his own game.\n\n\"I am even helping coaching with Enniskillen and you see the game from a different style.\n\n\"It has opened my mind up to what the players have to do and what they sense and that has brought my game along.\n\n\"I hope I can show out on the pitch now as well.\"\n\nIreland will look to build on their positive result against Italy when they travel to play England.\n\nSteve Borthwick's outfit come into the game on the back of a heavy defeat by Scotland with Baloucoune adding that Ireland are prepared for the challenging game.\n\n\"Going to Twickenham is something you can always get up for,\" he added.\n\n\"We know it is going to be tough as well, they are going to be hurting and the game is going to be physical and we know what we have to bring.\n\n\"We looked at their kicking game and I think that is something that we dealt with in the other games.\n\n\"In the Italy game we dealt with their kicks and it was a good way to get back into the game. We have a gameplan in place.\"",

    "description": "With Wales reeling from heavy defeats against England and France, BBC Sport  analyses the areas they must improve on to try and beat Scotland.",
    "fullText": "It would have been the date circled in Steve Tandy's calendar after deciding to leave Scotland and return to Wales.\n\nThe day that old meets new for the Tandy household with the Scots travelling to Cardiff in the Six Nations.\n\nThe first two games in the tournament have been chastening for Wales with heavy defeats by England and France.\n\nNow there is the chance to face a side closer to Wales in the world rankings, a team that their head coach knows all about. But an opposition that knows all about him too.\n\nTandy and his opposite number - his former boss Gregor Townsend - were sitting metres apart in the Arms Park stands watching the Under-20s match which the hosts won. The senior coaches had contrasting results last weekend.\n\nScotland arrive in Cardiff buoyed by a 31-20 Calcutta Cup victory over England that saw them bounce back from their opening defeat to Italy.\n\nWales were clinging to the positives from the 54-12 loss to France, which they say included an improved set-piece and evidence of a developing attacking game.\n\nSo, with Scotland firm favourites to inflict further pain on Wales, the hosts will know they will have to improve in a lot more areas to be within a chance of achieving that elusive win.\n\nWales v Scotland, Principality Stadium\n\nSaturday, 21 February at 16:40 GMT\n\nWatch live on BBC One and iPlayer from 16:00 GMT; radio commentary on BBC Sounds via BBC Radio Sports Extra, BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru and BBC Radio Scotland Extra; text commentary and match highlights on BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThe WRU are expecting a bigger crowd than the 57,744 who attended last week. That figure was the lowest for a Six Nations game at the Principality Stadium since it was built in 1999.\n\nThis is the consequence of Wales losing 23 out of the previous 25 matches, with 13 successive Six Nations defeats stretching back to March 2023, and the off-the-field turmoil surrounding the game.\n\nCaptain Dewi Lake faced the now regular weekly question about the importance of home support.\n\n\"It helps massively and you speak about people being a 16th man, especially in this stadium with the roof closed,\" said Lake.\n\n\"That sound echoes and the anthem was class last week. It's our job to get fans in the stadium, off their seat and in the game.\n\n\"Principality Stadium can erupt and it's unbelievable when that happens. It's the heartbeat of the nation when it's like that and it's our job to get people rocking and put smiles on faces.\n\n\"I suppose all we ask for in return is support and noise, and people feeding us that energy, because we feed off the crowd, their noise and reactions.\"\n\nThose stirring words have not been backed up by success in recent times. The ground is no longer a fortress. It has not been for some time.\n\nIt is now the venue where other teams come to enjoy themselves with England, Argentina, South Africa and France boasting record victories in Cardiff in the past 11 months.\n\nWales have not won a Six Nations game in Cardiff since the February 2022 success against Scotland, some 1,470 days ago.\n\nThe Scots ended their 22-year drought when they won at the Principality Stadium two years ago in a 27-26 thriller.\n\nKinghorn & Van der Merwe return for Scots in Wales\n\nCostelow and Hamer-Webb start for Wales v Scotland\n\nWales v Scotland - your guide to the Six Nations date\n\nWales will get the crowd involved if they begin positively. The problem is they are notorious slow starters with deficits of 27-0 and 28-8 yielded to Scotland in the past two games that they have not managed to overhaul.\n\nThat issue has been magnified during this campaign in the opening quarter against England and France with the matches practically over halfway through the first half in both contests.\n\nWales trailed 29-0 away against England at half-time, while they conceded 19 points in the opening 15 minutes against France.\n\n\"That's something we've spoken about, not giving ourselves a mountain to climb after 15 or 20 minutes of rugby,\" said Lake.\n\n\"We are a group that will fight back but we don't want to have that battle.\n\n\"We don't want to give ourselves that mountain to climb and start chasing things, so that first 20 minutes will be vital.\"\n\nThere is a growing feeling this Wales team should not be losing games by the large margins, when you look at the talent and experience of some individuals.\n\nSome ex-professionals have been scathing in their appraisals of Wales players this week, likening mistakes to that of made by club or even youth sides.\n\nLock Adam Beard, who has been dropped for Ben Carter, made the most glaring error against France with his attempted kick resulting a try for the visitors just before half-time.\n\nTandy aims to solve Finn Russell problem\n\nFriends reunited as Tandy prepares to face Scotland\n\nScotland game chance for Wales to 'deliver better'\n\nWales have conceded 302 points and 42 tries in the six games Tandy has been in charge, with the head coach currently combining that role with defensive duties.\n\nThat will be addressed after the tournament with a permanent coach coming in.\n\nIn this tournament they have shipped 102 points and 15 tries in the first two games.\n\n\"It's been spoken about,” said Lake.\n\n\"We've played two of the top four teams in the world in the first two rounds.\n\n\"That's not an excuse over the tries we've conceded and we've worked hard defensively this week on aspects of our defence, getting off the line a bit more, getting a bit wider because we were getting too tight around rucks.\"\n\nTandy echoed that Les Bleus exposed Wales' narrow defence.\n\n\"There were moments in the game against France we could have got wider,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"Some of it is down to communication to get people into positions to go forward and not assuming things will happen.\"\n\nTandy 'needs help' - Wales' hunt for defence coach\n\nWales 'can't cut corners' in losing streak - Wilson\n\nCan Scotland back up England heroics in Wales?\n\nDiscipline improved last week after Wales conceded 16 penalties against England. Against France they infringed nine times.\n\nScarlets flanker Taine Plumtree has been given a start as he aims to shake off the ill-discipline tag following three yellow cards in three Wales games and six sin-binnings this season.\n\nTandy has selected another new-look back row with Aaron Wainwright, Wales’ best player in the opening two games, switching back to his favoured number eight role as they face a Scotland trio without injured duo Jack Dempsey and Jamie Ritchie.\n\nCardiff's Alex Mann continues in the unfamiliar open-side role, despite Josh Macleod, Harri Deaves and James Botham in the squad and Tommy Reffell continually overlooked.\n\n\"The way we want to play at the minute and for the game against Scotland, we feel Manny's the right fit,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"Against Ireland and Italy, it might be different, but where we feel we want to play against Scotland, we feel Manny's right.\"\n\nTuipulotu on red alert as Scotland face wounded Welsh\n\nWales will also have to smarten up the kicking game after France punished them last week.\n\n\"We weren't as accurate as we were against England, where we felt there was more of a competition,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"We still feel that is still a part of our game that could be a real strength.\"\n\nUncapped Leicester wing Gabriel Hamer-Webb is considered an aerial threat and has been selected at the expense of Ellis Mee, with Josh Adams keeping his place.\n\nTandy has changed the fly-half with Sam Costelow replacing Dan Edwards, who had started the past seven matches and all six games under Tandy.\n\n\"We feel this is a reward for how Sam has played. I believe we're starting to get a bit of competition in that area,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"Dan's been good, he was excellent in the autumn. He's played a lot of rugby, he's a young man and there are no issues with him.\"\n\nTandy was seen talking to Edwards in the final training session of the week with the fly-half warmly tapping his coach on the back after the conversation finished.\n\nIt proves Tandy is a well-liked man in Wales and Scotland. Somehow he needs to deliver a win from somewhere. Anywhere.\n\nThere is no time like the present against his former employers and at a home venue where Welsh fans have been starved of Six Nations success in recent times.",

    "description": "BBC Sport explores the special scheme which has taken athletes to gold medal glory in sports they had never tried before.",
    "fullText": "You're at home. Lying on the couch. Packet of crisps almost finished. Mild lower back pain niggling away. Dishes in the sink still to do.\n\nAnd yet, as you watch athletes hurl themselves down a snow-covered mountain in the pursuit of glory at the Winter Olympics, you're thinking: \"pfft, I could do that\".\n\nWell, why not see if you really could?\n\nFor almost two decades UK Sport has held in-person talent ID sessions for aspiring athletes, designed to test their physical performance and match them up with the sport that would suit them best.\n\nIt is exactly how skeleton gold medallists Matt Weston and Tabitha Stoecker discovered they were well suited to sliding head first down an ice slope at 80mph.\n\nBut here's the thing - anybody can apply online to attend a session.\n\nSo how does it work, and could you really be Great Britain's next Olympic or Paralympic star?\n\nUK Sport's Talent ID days are designed to take those with natural athleticism and sporting talent, figure out where their major strengths are, and match them up with a sport they may never have tried or even heard of before.\n\nThe analysis at a Talent ID day includes a series of tests measuring power, stamina, speed, and agility.\n\nAnybody aged 17 or over can apply online, and athletes who drop out of one sport in the early stages of their career are often invited along to see if something else may work for them.\n\nExaminers also assess each athlete's character, scoring their ability to regulate emotions, control their performance and under pressure, and understand and respond to feedback.\n\nThough applications are open to anybody, eventual selection for a sport still requires a high level of natural ability.\n\n\"Talent ID is an opportunity for us to find athletes a little bit later in the journey than you might normally join a programme,\" says Dr Kate Baker, director of performance and people at UK Sport.\n\n\"If you're not super fast, or able to build fast twitch muscle quickly, you're probably not going to make it in skeleton.\n\n\"Then we've got sports like cross-country skiing, which require extraordinary aerobic capability. So if you are someone who loves a long run and can go forever, then it's those kind of sports that you're probably going to want to look towards.\"\n\nThe approach has yielded plenty of medal success for Great Britain since its launch, and has been especially beneficial for winter sports, which athletes may never have had an opportunity to try out before attending Talent ID.\n\nWeston switched to skeleton nine years ago, having previously competed in elite junior categories in taekwondo, while Stoecker has trained as a circus performer.\n\nIn the 48 hours after Weston and Stoecker won gold, the British Bobsleigh and Skeleton Association had 4,000 applicants to their Talent ID campaign.\n\n\"I did flying trapeze, acrobatics, and I absolutely loved the performance element of it all,\" Stoecker says.\n\n\"Then I saw an advert on Instagram for the Talent ID process and was selected for skeleton - I guess the rest is history!\"\n\nTalent ID is also used to recruit athletes with disabilities aiming to compete at the Paralympics.\n\nParalympians who came through the pathway include Emma Wiggs, who was working as a teacher when she was matched with sitting volleyball at a Talent ID day in 2010, before leading the women's team to an eighth-place finish at the 2012 Games in London.\n\nWiggs eventually switched to para-canoeing after trying out more sports, winning gold in the KL2 at the 2016 and 2020 Games.\n\n\"When people apply to our main database, we gather information about their disability and invite them to events they are eligible for,\" says Ben Quilter, who competed in judo for ParalympicsGB and is now part of UK Sport's recruitment team.\n\n\"We group together sports with similar physiology, skill aspects or age requirements, and then put events on where people can come along and try a few different sports at the same time.\n\n\"We look at the impairment type, because the difference with Paralympic sport is you can acquire an impairment at various stages of life.\"\n\nBut Talent ID sessions do not necessarily work for all sports, some of which require a natural technical aptitude learned at a young age.\n\n\"We're not sure yet whether it will work for curling [for example],\" says Baker.\n\n\"When you look at skill-based sports - technical or tactical sports - generally people have been doing those for a bit longer.\n\n\"Most of those men and women that you're seeing out on the rinks have been doing it since they were tiny, and it's really in their bones.\"\n\nBut that does not mean that people cannot succeed in something they had never considered before.\n\nBefore 2008, rower Helen Glover had no experience in a boat, but had competed in hockey, tennis and swimming.\n\nGlover went on to become on to become a two-time Olympic, three-time world, and five-time European champion.\n\n\"I hope my story can be an inspiration for kids in PE or at home thinking about taking up a new sport,\" Glover previously told the BBC.\n\n\"Just go on, go for it - you don't know what's going to happen.\"",

    "title": "'Losing the dressing room' - what does it mean and how can it happen?",
    "description": "\"Losing the dressing room\" is now part of football's vocabulary. Chief football writer Phil McNulty asks what it means, how it happens and can it be solved?",
    "fullText": "The phrase \"losing the dressing room\" now holds a regular place in modern football's lexicon, the game's ominous code for a manager sliding into trouble.\n\nThomas Frank's sacking at Tottenham Hotspur and Sean Dyche's dismissal after only 114 days at Nottingham Forest were both accompanied by talk of internal discontent and revolt as players supposedly lost faith in their methods and approach.\n\nSo what can lead to someone \"losing the dressing room\" - and can a manager ever find it again once it is lost?\n\nIf leaks appear and rebellion rises in the ranks, there is usually only one outcome - the manager's departure.\n\nEx-England midfielder Danny Murphy, who played for clubs including Fulham and Liverpool, told BBC Sport: \"I take it as meaning when groups of players start questioning the manager's ability. It normally comes when you're losing.\n\n\"Questions arise around team selection, playing style, training sessions, days off. Everything. It all starts getting questioned, initially by little cliques of players, then it spreads.\"\n\nHe added: \"It could be players who are playing, but still don't completely agree with what the manager is trying to do. I think the feeling would be that players who are out of the team are more vocal with stuff like that, but it doesn't mean it's just them.\n\n\"It can become a constant noise in the dressing room.\n\n\"It is not as if I experienced players making a conscious plan to get the manager out. That's far-fetched, but for me 'losing the dressing room' means that you have more than a minority of players who feel you are on a bad path to failure.\"\n\nFormer striker Chris Sutton, who won the Premier League with Blackburn, added: \"It happens when players don't really listen to the manager any more. They just switch off - his messaging is lost.\n\n\"It could be tactics, clashes of personality. Many things. As an ex-player I know players can be fickle. The game is results-driven. Dressing rooms are fundamentally happy places when teams are winning. When they're not, the blame game can start.\"\n\nMurphy cites his experiences with former Fulham manager Lawrie Sanchez, who brought him to Craven Cottage from Tottenham in 2007.\n\n\"Lawrie is a good guy, I am very grateful he brought me to Fulham,\" Murphy said. \"Nothing personal. It wasn't anything personal at the time, just a difference.\n\n\"He wanted to play long ball, very pragmatic football. We had a lot of good footballers, technicians, so even if you're in the team, there was still a feeling of 'What are we doing and why are we doing it?'\n\n\"Lawrie was adamant this was the way we were going to get results but the more games we lost, the more it didn't work, the more it was questioned.\n\n\"You walk on the pitch a little bit sceptical, and that can transfer physically into your performance.\"\n\nMurphy added: \"Lawrie believed in his way because initially he kept Fulham up doing this. He had success with Wycombe Wanderers and Northern Ireland.\n\n\"He'd also had success playing that way with Wimbledon, so it was understandable. It was just that he didn't have the capability or desire to want to try something else, even just to see.\"\n\nSanchez was sacked after only eight months at Fulham, having taken charge between April and December 2007.\n\nIn Dyche's case, a dressing room can be lost very quickly, after succeeding Ange Postecoglou to become Forest's third permanent manager this season.\n\nDyche's reign went downhill after a good start, with BBC sources suggesting he struggled to bond with some players who questioned his methods and tactics, as he focused on the squad's physicality.\n\nPlayers' opinions were also canvassed after defeat at Leeds United and they did not give Dyche their full backing.\n\nSo how quickly can a dressing room turn against a manager – and could it even happen before he steps through the door?\n\nSutton said: \"Players talk when a new manager comes in. Some players may have experienced that manager before, or there may have been fall-out. I think instant impact is important.\n\n\"Certain managers will go into a club and want to do things their own particular way. They may leave out a club legend who's already there, or a strong character, then that person won't be happy and might be influential in the dressing room.\"\n\nMurphy believes every manager gets a chance, but warned: \"It can change within three or four games.\n\n\"It can happen after a few bad results and performances, when you feel like you're really struggling, getting beaten heavily, not competing in games.\n\n\"So maybe a month. One of the difficulties is when you have a dressing room where there is a little bit of pushback because some players are OK with the manager.\n\n\"This can become toxic as well because what you don't want is a group of players who feel differently, because then you don't have that cohesion and togetherness.\n\n\"But I would suggest when it starts going wrong it becomes a majority quite quickly.\"\n\nThe simplest answer to improving matters is winning, with strategy producing results, even when the manager's methods are under scrutiny from players.\n\nAnother, according to those with experience, is listening and adaptability.\n\nMurphy was part of the Liverpool squad that won a treble of Uefa Cup, FA Cup and League Cup under Gerard Houllier in 2001, adding another League Cup in 2003.\n\nHe admitted Houllier's hardline approach met early resistance but results, and the manager's willingness to listen, turned things around.\n\n\"Initially the discipline was unbearable for a lot of the lads because he was so different,\" said Murphy.\n\n\"There was a lot of pushback away from him, away from his ears not to him, but results and performances improved so much that the proof was in the pudding.\"\n\nHoullier went on to manage Liverpol for six years, winning the FA Cup, two League Cups, the Uefa Cup and the Super Cup.\n\nThe requirements of producing a winning team while performing the balancing act of keeping players happy, especially those out of the team or those who prefer a different style, is now an essential part of a manager's tool-kit.\n\nSutton said: \"I just find this whole player power baffling. It seems loaded heavily in players' favour now.\n\n\"Sean Dyche is very straight, very direct, in the way he manages. Players were supposedly unhappy at being called out after losing the FA Cup tie at Wrexham.\n\n\"He was critical of players who had been given an opportunity, fringe players who hadn't taken their chance. They were unhappy - but what did he say that wasn't true?\n\n\"And what about Thomas Frank at Spurs? At the end Cristian Romero, his club captain, killed him at Manchester United with a terrible red card,\n\n\"Romero, by all accounts, is an influential, well-liked figure in the Tottenham dressing room, so Thomas Frank was in a position where he can't come out and throw him to the wolves by saying 'he's absolutely killed me there' - which he had. He has to back him to try to keep him on side.\n\n\"It seems club owners have the ear of players and vice versa. I can't honestly say that I was never at a club where I felt I was in a position worthy of going to the club owner, bypassing the manager. The game has changed.\"\n\nSutton believes not, insisting: \"I think pretty much once it's gone, it's gone.\n\n\"A manager can pull it back if, in the short term, he goes on an unbelievable run of results and you get players believing in what you're doing and what they're doing - or maybe with a massive cull, but once it's a gone, a manager has real problems.\"\n\nMurphy added: \"A manager can get it back, but it's rare. It's the exception rather than the rule.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Toyota’s most senior software executive has revealed that the carmaker is considering banning drivers from switching off vehicle safety features in the Combination of increasing government regulations and Toyota’s goal of zero traffic accidents are forcing hard questions about turning safety technology off",
    "fullText": "Toyota’s most senior software executive has revealed that the carmaker is considering banning drivers from switching off vehicle safety features in the future.\n\nGovernment regulations normally shape the degree of strictness a carmaker imposes, and Australian and European safety regulations in recent years have started to impose various lane keeping, speed limit awareness and driver monitoring systems in cars.\n\nAt present, those systems can typically be switched off manually at the touch of a button or swipe of a screen, if the driver deems that they would prefer to manage these processes themselves.\n\nBut Toyota software development centre president Akihiro Sarada says that the Japanese carmaker is serious about its mission of “zero traffic accidents” — not just deaths, but all car accidents.\n\n“Our ultimate goal is to eradicate all traffic accidents, and of course, autonomous driving is a technology that is necessary to realise a safe environment,” said Sarada.\n\n“We have to study and decide if we would enable an ‘off’ button.”\n\nAllowing drivers to operate the vehicle however they see fit, including by exceeding the speed limit or approaching lane markings to hit a corner apex, may not be compatible with achieving Toyota’s goal of eliminating accidents.\n\nSarada said that Toyota was considering allowing drivers to temporarily disable safety features — or drive in the manner they see fit — in two environments: on roads where the car’s software knows no other cars or pedestrians are around, and on the racetrack.\n\n“If it is safe, for example, if it is on the circuit, [autonomous driving and sporty human driving] can co-exist,” said Sarada.\n\n“In the area[s] where drivers are able to have fun driving, then we want them to have the discretion to decide the way they drive their cars.\n\n“We have to really study in detail whether or not it is really mandatory for us to control that detail, to the level where we have to forbid them to enjoy their driving.”\n\nToyota’s software boss also hinted that connected-car technology — online systems that detect other cars, pedestrians and road conditions — might even allow keen drivers to drive as they see fit on the public road, but that warnings would kick in if risks increased.\n\n“Drivers want to have excitement in driving. By using connected data, they can receive announcements that under [certain] conditions they can have more fun, that right now it is safe, but several seconds later, [if] there is a risk [they can] receive a warning beforehand,” Sarada explained.\n\nBut even this ‘leniency’ could, in theory, stop a driver from disabling safety technologies like lane-centring or speed limit controls on country roads if other cars, cyclists or particularly pedestrians are present in the area.\n\nIt’s a balancing act within Toyota between departments like Sarada’s — tasked with deploying software that reduces accidents, injury and death — and performance-arm GR, which must convince buyers that they should spend their cash on sporty, fun-to-drive cars.\n\nFor decades, Toyota has run ahead of some vehicle safety regulations. For more than 20 years, drivers and passengers in Toyota and Lexus models have been unable to input satellite navigation destinations while the vehicle is in motion.\n\nThat’s a common practice that other carmakers would typically allow, sometimes via rotary dials — often perceived as ‘safer’ to use while moving — but also often via simple touchscreen inputs.\n\nIn recent years other firms have followed Toyota’s lead on blocking some touchscreen functions while the vehicle is in motion. The two key smartphone mirroring products, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, both prevent most on-screen keyboard use while driving.\n\nEuropean regulations have also started to encroach on touchscreen use via that continent’s Advanced Driver Distraction Warning requirements, which will come into force for all new vehicles registered in the EU from July 2026.\n\nEven in the EU, however, safety features — including speed warning, stability control and lane-keeping are typically allowed be switched off, though all restart at the next vehicle ignition and a driver would be held responsible for increasing the risk of a crash if a safety system is deactivated.\n\nTypically, governments — including in Australia and Europe — issue broad guidelines for how safety features should work, leaving precise implementation decisions up to carmakers.",

    "description": "Pedro Neto has been criticised for lacking a \"killer instinct\", but the Chelsea winger's shape-shifting role goes some way to explain that.",
    "fullText": "Chelsea winger Pedro Neto could not resist putting his fingers in his ears after scoring against Hull City - a pointed celebration he has done numerous times this season but refused to explain.\n\nAsked if it was directed at anyone in particular, the winger told BBC Sport: \"Yes. I will not tell it, but yes. I'll continue my work. I want to help my team-mates and all the fans. I'll keep working hard and move on to the next one.\"\n\nThose cryptic comments felt jarring in the wake of his first career hat-trick and a season in which he has scored 10 goals in all competitions and provided four assists - leaving him behind only Enzo Fernandez and Joao Pedro for goal involvements at Chelsea this term.\n\nNeto opened the scoring at Hull last Friday with a sensational swerving effort. His subsequent corner went straight in for the second, and he completed the 4-0 FA Cup rout with a strike from just outside the box.\n\nThe Portuguese had a slight dip in form - along with the rest of the team - during a poor winter run in which former manager Enzo Maresca departed on New Year's Day.\n\nBut Maresca's replacement Liam Rosenior could not understand why anyone would have been critical of the winger, describing Neto as \"world class\" and praising the \"sacrifices\" he makes for the team.\n\nRosenior's second point hints at why Neto may be misunderstood by some.\n\nAfter Maresca left Chelsea, they drew 1-1 at Manchester City, and Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville singled out Neto for criticism.\n\n\"He frustrated me like you won't believe,\" Neville said. \"He's a smidgen away from being an Eden Hazard, but he's never going to be an Eden Hazard because he hasn't got that killer instinct.\"\n\nNeto only scored 14 times in 135 games for Wolves before his £54m move in August 2024 - averaging one goal every 9.6 matches. At Chelsea, he has 19 goals in 89 games, averaging one every 4.7.\n\nThose figures alone underline why it was always unrealistic to expect him to be another Hazard, who netted 110 times in 352 Chelsea matches.\n\nNeto has only one assist and no goals in his past 12 league games, but he has four goals and two assists in four domestic cup fixtures - albeit three of those matches were against lower‑division opposition - to paint a more positive picture.\n\nThe 25-year-old is attempting fewer shots in the league this season - 1.7 per 90 minutes compared with 2.3 in 2024-25 - but is getting higher‑quality chances, averaging 0.11 expected goals per shot compared to 0.06. That shift explains why his conversion rate has almost doubled, from 6.8% to 13.5%.\n\nIn terms of output among players at the current top six clubs, Leandro Trossard, Bryan Mbeumo, Mohamed Salah, Morgan Rogers and Jeremy Doku all rank higher for non‑penalty goals per 90 minutes.\n\nBut Neto is a different type of forward, with only 7% of his touches coming in the opposition box - fewer than any of the players above him.\n\nWhere he does excel at is ball-carrying, something he attributes to following his father and uncles into roller hockey as a child. Among the Premier League's top six clubs, only Doku ranks higher for carries. Neto is also second only to Mbeumo for sprints per 90 minutes.\n\nOne of Neto's standout performances came against Paris St-Germain in the 3-0 Club World Cup final win, when he man‑marked full‑back Achraf Hakimi.\n\nAnother was the night Maresca surprised Barcelona boss Hansi Flick by deploying Neto as a striker, allowing him to exploit the Spanish side's extremely high line with his pace.\n\nMost comfortable on the right wing, Neto has been used as a striker, left winger, wing-back and number 10 for Chelsea this season.\n\nThose \"sacrifices\" for the team, as Rosenior called it, make Neto more comparable to Willian than Hazard when looking for parallels from Chelsea's recent past.\n\nAlongside his fingers‑in‑ears and \"stop talking\" celebrations, Neto was also seen arguing with Tottenham fans during Chelsea's 1-0 away win in November.\n\nIn an interview last season, Neto reflected on his celebrations, saying: \"When you win you are the best and when you lose you are the worst\".\n\nNeto seems to simply dislike the scrutiny he receives but it has not stopped him, as he puts it, \"working\" - helping Chelsea and steadily improving his own game.\n\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Chelsea - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "English light-middleweight champion Bilal Fawaz challenges for the British title belt on Saturday, but is still fighting for a British passport.",
    "fullText": "The small talk of a taxi ride is the beating heart of British chit-chat - a soundtrack to thousands of journeys across London and beyond.\n\nOn Sunday, a passenger might glance at the driver in the rear view mirror and ask the usual: \"Good weekend, mate? Get up to much?\"\n\nFor 37-year-old Bilal Fawaz, the answer could be a little different than the usual traffic complaints or remarks about the drizzle.\n\n\"I became a British champion. And then I drove this Uber,\" he plans to say, using the same casual tone he might use to discuss a bottleneck on the North Circular.\n\nBut for that conversation to happen, Fawaz must first handle business this Saturday in Nottingham, where he challenges Ishmael Davis for the prestigious British light-middleweight title.\n\nIn boxing, the story of the \"working-class hero\" - the athlete who still clocks in for a nine-to-five - is a great marketing hook. But for Fawaz, there is no romanticism in the grind.\n\n\"I'm an Uber driver. I'm a personal trainer. I'm a fitness instructor. And I'm a professional boxer. That's four jobs,\" he tells BBC Sport in fight week.\n\n\"I was doing Uber the day I came here. I trained clients before I left London. I pay for the car on a subscription every week and if I don't work, money goes out and nothing comes in.\n\n\"So on Sunday after the fight, when the kids are asleep, I'll jump in the car, make £70 or £80, park it, sleep, drop them to nursery and train clients again.\"\n\nFawaz is articulate and thoughtful, with a hint of theatrical flair that reflects his time at acting school.\n\nBut beneath that poise lie challenges far heavier than night shifts or 10-round fights. His fight began long before Nottingham - a childhood marked by abuse, years in the care system and a life spent proving he belongs.\n\nBBC Sport first told Fawaz's story in 2018, revisited it in 2022, and yet he remains in limbo as an English champion still without a passport.\n\nWood v Warrington 2: Last man standing\n\nNo 'easy' rematch with Warrington, says Wood\n\nBorn in Nigeria to a Beninese mother and a Lebanese father, Fawaz suffered severe physical abuse at the hands of his mother. When he was eight, his father - a distant presence - sent him to live with an uncle instead.\n\nAt 14, Fawaz was trafficked to London. He arrived believing he was coming to reunite with his father; instead, he was held in conditions that amounted to modern slavery - locked inside a house and forced to work, cut off from education and the outside world.\n\n\"My early years, I wouldn't wish them on anyone,\" he says. \"It strips a kid of the feeling of belonging. It strips away safeness, shelter, trust. Imagine a kid bowling around with no one to talk to. That was me.\"\n\nWhen he finally escaped, Fawaz entered the care system - a system designed to protect vulnerable children, but one he believes failed him.\n\nIn his youth, Fawaz received convictions for minor offences, including cannabis possession and graffiti. He avoided prison, but his record later complicated his immigration battles.\n\n\"People don't tell the youngsters, the young adults, that if you do this, these are the ramifications. If you do that, this is what will happen,\" he says.\n\n\"Social services should have helped me, but who am I? I'm just a number. Those traumas leave spiritual and emotional scars.\n\n\"I try to pretend they aren't there, but they haunt me. They make me wonder: What if I'd had parents? What if I'd had guidance?\"\n\nLive text commentary and radio coverage from 19:00 GMT on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds, BBC Sport website and app and from 22:00 on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\nThe All Stars boxing gym in Kilburn offered sanctuary. Fawaz flourished as an amateur, becoming an English champion and captaining the national team. Outside the ring, however, uncertainty still defined his life. Fawaz has been held in detention centres twice and faced deportation threats.\n\n\"The Nigerian embassy said I'm not a Nigerian. The Lebanese embassy said they don't have any record of me. And Beninese? There's no record because I wasn't born there,\" he explains.\n\nA judge eventually ruled the Home Office had no lawful grounds to detain him. He was released, effectively stateless.\n\nBut despite that ruling, his official status continued to be listed as Nigerian, preventing him from being formally recognised as stateless under UK law. Twice, he watched Olympic dreams and six-figure contracts disappear because he was not legally allowed to work or travel.\n\nFawaz was finally granted a work permit and turned professional in 2022. Now he must make up for lost time.\n\n\"It's better to have a portion of something than nothing at all,\" he says. \"If you keep working hard, the hard work will find a way to engulf the problem and make it tolerable. That is what I'm doing.\"\n\nAfter his win over Junaid Bostan last year earned Fawaz the English title, his life remains a series of contradictions.\n\n\"How can you be an English champion fighting for a British title and you don't have a British passport? How can you beat the champion of a country and you're not a citizen?\" he asks. \"I've been here 24 years. I am British. There's no way about it.\"\n\nFawaz has a British wife and two sons, aged one and three. When he looks at their passports, he is reminded of a freedom he is still being denied.\n\n\"It would mean the world to have one. I want to provide for them, to travel, to give them a better house,\" he says. \"But the Home Office gave me a 10-year route to settlement, which means I'll get my passport in 2034 or 2035. By then, I'll be too old to box.\"\n\nA Home Office spokesperson told BBC Sport that while it does not routinely comment on individual cases, the decision to place Fawaz on a 10-year route to settlement was not made by the department.\n\nFor now, Fawaz's career has a ceiling. He cannot travel abroad for lucrative fights in Saudi Arabia or the US. Instead, a home fight against Newcastle's IBF world champion Josh Kelly is his target. He hopes that continuing to succeed and pick up titles may strengthen his case.\n\n\"Maybe the Home Secretary or someone at Parliament can expedite my wait and give me a British passport so I can fight for the country and make it proud,\" he says.\n\nAfter a brief pause, he adds: \"Actually, I'm already making this country proud.\"\n\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story you can visit BBC Action Line.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "What's eating Arsenal? Sunday's North London derby is now a test of the Gunners' \"bottle\", says chief football writer Phil McNulty.",
    "fullText": "Arsenal's north London derby trip to Tottenham Hotspur will be played out against a backdrop of searching questions about their nerve - \"bottle\", as it is often called - character and even public mockery from their rivals.\n\nThe most basic question is this. Are Mikel Arteta's side choking amid Arsenal's greatest opportunity to win the Premier League for the first time since Arsene Wenger's \"Invincibles\" of 2003-04?\n\nThe landscape around this trip to hostile territory has shifted so dramatically in the last fortnight that it has moved from what resembled a walk in the park to a test of every quality required to win the title.\n\nArsenal will go to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium - where Spurs have won only two of 13 league games this term - with the toxicity caused by former head coach Thomas Frank's presence potentially removed by his sacking and replacement by Igor Tudor.\n\nTudor's appointment is essentially designed to avoid relegation.\n\nHis chequered managerial career has taken in Hajduk Split, Galatasaray, Udinese, Marseille, Lazio and Juventus.\n\nFor all that, Tudor has specialised in fast starts in charge of clubs, a powerful personality whose arrival delivers an extra ingredient to what was already going to be a super-charged atmosphere.\n\nIt all adds up to a severe examination of Arsenal just as they look to be creaking under the pressure of chasing that elusive Premier League crown.\n\nArsenal remain top of the table. They finished top of the Champions League standings with eight wins from eight games. They face Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final and have an eminently winnable FA Cup fifth round tie at League One side Mansfield Town.\n\nArsenal's catastrophic concession of a 2-0 lead at relegation certainties Wolves, as well as the way in which that advantage was lost, was an example of tension that has gripped the Gunners on and off the pitch in a run of only two wins from seven Premier League games.\n\nAs if that collapse at Molineux, concluded amid angry scenes involving players from both sides, was not enough, Wolves' social media accounts rubbed salt in Arsenal's wounds by poking fun in a TikTok post captioned \"Game Management\".\n\nIn a post watched by more than two million, it was aimed at Arsenal's perceived time-wasting at corners and what was clearly regarded as an over-reaction to injuries.\n\nThere was also an image of Gabriel Martinelli taunting Wolves' fans with a \"2-1\" gesture, only to look daft when Arsenal conceded that late leveller.\n\nWolves' time-wasting jibe was followed by an Opta statistic that Arsenal have taken a league-high total of 117 minutes to restart games from corners this season. They also have the longest average delay of restart from corners at 44 seconds.\n\nLow blows from Wolves, but blows that may have landed on already frayed nerves.\n\nThe chaotic manner of Wolves' 94th-minute equaliser from Tom Edozie - eventually going in off Riccardo Calafiori - summed up Arsenal's panic-stricken finale as goalkeeper David Raya collided haplessly with defender Gabriel to cause confusion.\n\nWhat was an opportunity to apply psychological pressure by extending their lead to seven points was squandered, leaving Arsenal only five clear of Manchester City having played one game more.\n\nIt was Arsenal's recent problems in microcosm.\n\nRaya and the Gunners' defence have slipped from the high standards that gave them a nine-point advantage over City and Aston Villa on 7 February, albeit that Pep Guardiola's side had a game in hand.\n\nArsenal's fate still remains in their own hands. The problem is that the same applies to City, with the sides scheduled to meet at Etihad Stadium on 18 April.\n\nAnd this is where the nerves and the past play into the current narrative that Arsenal are wobbling, having finished second in the last three campaigns, twice to City and last season to Liverpool.\n\nArsenal exactly where we want to be - Arteta\n\nThe eerie similarities between Arsenal's 2007-08 collapse and now\n\n'Bottle word will be used' as Arsenal blow title advantage\n\nIn this chase, Manchester City have form for successfully hunting down league leaders.\n\nArsenal's form at this stage of the season is unflattering when compared to City's. In each of the last four campaigns, City have amassed more points than Arsenal in the final 12 games.\n\nThe biggest differential was 12 points in 2021-22, the narrowest one point in 2023-24, when a 2-0 loss at home to Aston Villa on 14 April effectively cost Arsenal the title.\n\nAnd several factors are now coming into play as Arsenal need to prove they can cope with the pressure of ending that barren title run, with City breathing down their necks.\n\nSince their 4-1 win against Aston Villa on 30 December, the ring of steel Arsenal assembled in defence has lost its strength. They have subsequently conceded one league goal per game as opposed to 0.61 before.\n\nArsenal have also appeared to drop into a more risk-averse, negative approach when in front and looking to have games under control.\n\nLeads have been lost against Manchester United, Brentford and - most damagingly - Wolves in recent weeks.\n\nIs the fear of losing, or drawing, turning up the pressure valve on players who will know this season represents their best chance of winning the title to such an extent they are now struggling to close out victories?\n\nIt is a highly pressurised environment. This season there are no excuses. It may just be now or never.\n\nArteta invariably cuts an agitated figure on the sidelines. He recently urged Arsenal's fans to \"jump on the fun boat\", but does not look as if he is having fun at the moment, even though he is leading a team top of the table and insists \"the present is beautiful\".\n\nHe says he will be \"keeping calm, keeping my eyes open, my ears open, and understanding what the players need to give their best\".\n\nArteta added: \"We have to live the present. What we did in the past is great, but we have to live the present, and the present is beautiful.\n\n\"We are exactly where we want to be in every competition. We need to earn it, like we've done in the last seven or eight months.\"\n\nGetting to this position, and it is a healthy one, is another factor in the equation. Are the physical demands starting to take their toll on players?\n\nMartin Zubimendi, outstanding since his summer move from Real Sociedad, is one such example.\n\nHe has seen more Premier League action than any other Arsenal outfield player, figuring in all 27 games with 26 starts, playing 2,270 minutes in his first season in the English top flight.\n\nEberechi Eze has almost been a bystander in comparison, despite the fanfare that greeted his £60m arrival from Crystal Palace in August, stolen away from Spurs at the 11th hour.\n\nSince scoring a hat-trick in the 4-1 win against Spurs in November, Eze has featured in all 15 of Arsenal's league games but has made only four starts and played 360 minutes.\n\nThe wider questions, however, surround Arsenal's temperament to withstand the pressure that is suddenly closing in on them, an ominous reminder of previous failings.\n\nArsenal are still in a superb position in every competition – positions they would have instantly signed up for in August. And their cause could be helped the return of key duo Martin Odegaard and Kai Havertz.\n\nIf the Gunners win at Spurs, doubts will be eased, but one thing is beyond question.\n\nThis north London derby is now a completely different proposition from a fortnight ago.\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "title": "AI chatbots provide less-accurate information to vulnerable users",
    "description": "MIT researchers find AI chatbots often show bias, giving less accurate or more dismissive answers to some users. The findings highlight growing risks, especially for marginalized communities worldwide.",
    "fullText": "Large language models (LLMs) have been championed as tools that could democratize access to information worldwide, offering knowledge in a user-friendly interface regardless of a person’s background or location. However, new research from MIT’s Center for Constructive Communication (CCC) suggests these artificial intelligence systems may actually perform worse for the very users who could most benefit from them.\n\nA study conducted by researchers at CCC, which is based at the MIT Media Lab, found that state-of-the-art AI chatbots — including OpenAI’s GPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude 3 Opus, and Meta’s Llama 3 — sometimes provide less-accurate and less-truthful responses to users who have lower English proficiency, less formal education, or who originate from outside the United States. The models also refuse to answer questions at higher rates for these users, and in some cases, respond with condescending or patronizing language.\n\n“We were motivated by the prospect of LLMs helping to address inequitable information accessibility worldwide,” says lead author Elinor Poole-Dayan SM ’25, a technical associate in the MIT Sloan School of Management who led the research as a CCC affiliate and master’s student in media arts and sciences. “But that vision cannot become a reality without ensuring that model biases and harmful tendencies are safely mitigated for all users, regardless of language, nationality, or other demographics.”\n\nA paper describing the work, “LLM Targeted Underperformance Disproportionately Impacts Vulnerable Users,” was presented at the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence in January.\n\nSystematic underperformance across multiple dimensions\n\nFor this research, the team tested how the three LLMs responded to questions from two datasets: TruthfulQA and SciQ. TruthfulQA is designed to measure a model’s truthfulness (by relying on common misconceptions and literal truths about the real world), while SciQ contains science exam questions testing factual accuracy. The researchers prepended short user biographies to each question, varying three traits: education level, English proficiency, and country of origin.\n\nAcross all three models and both datasets, the researchers found significant drops in accuracy when questions came from users described as having less formal education or being non-native English speakers. The effects were most pronounced for users at the intersection of these categories: those with less formal education who were also non-native English speakers saw the largest declines in response quality.\n\nThe research also examined how country of origin affected model performance. Testing users from the United States, Iran, and China with equivalent educational backgrounds, the researchers found that Claude 3 Opus in particular performed significantly worse for users from Iran on both datasets.\n\n“We see the largest drop in accuracy for the user who is both a non-native English speaker and less educated,” says Jad Kabbara, a research scientist at CCC and a co-author on the paper. “These results show that the negative effects of model behavior with respect to these user traits compound in concerning ways, thus suggesting that such models deployed at scale risk spreading harmful behavior or misinformation downstream to those who are least able to identify it.”\n\nRefusals and condescending language\n\nPerhaps most striking were the differences in how often the models refused to answer questions altogether. For example, Claude 3 Opus refused to answer nearly 11 percent of questions for less educated, non-native English-speaking users — compared to just 3.6 percent for the control condition with no user biography.\n\nWhen the researchers manually analyzed these refusals, they found that Claude responded with condescending, patronizing, or mocking language 43.7 percent of the time for less-educated users, compared to less than 1 percent for highly educated users. In some cases, the model mimicked broken English or adopted an exaggerated dialect.\n\nThe model also refused to provide information on certain topics specifically for less-educated users from Iran or Russia, including questions about nuclear power, anatomy, and historical events — even though it answered the same questions correctly for other users.\n\n“This is another indicator suggesting that the alignment process might incentivize models to withhold information from certain users to avoid potentially misinforming them, although the model clearly knows the correct answer and provides it to other users,” says Kabbara.\n\nThe findings mirror documented patterns of human sociocognitive bias. Research in the social sciences has shown that native English speakers often perceive non-native speakers as less educated, intelligent, and competent, regardless of their actual expertise. Similar biased perceptions have been documented among teachers evaluating non-native English-speaking students.\n\n“The value of large language models is evident in their extraordinary uptake by individuals and the massive investment flowing into the technology,” says Deb Roy, professor of media arts and sciences, CCC director, and a co-author on the paper. “This study is a reminder of how important it is to continually assess systematic biases that can quietly slip into these systems, creating unfair harms for certain groups without any of us being fully aware.”\n\nThe implications are particularly concerning given that personalization features — like ChatGPT’s Memory, which tracks user information across conversations — are becoming increasingly common. Such features risk differentially treating already-marginalized groups.\n\n“LLMs have been marketed as tools that will foster more equitable access to information and revolutionize personalized learning,” says Poole-Dayan. “But our findings suggest they may actually exacerbate existing inequities by systematically providing misinformation or refusing to answer queries to certain users. The people who may rely on these tools the most could receive subpar, false, or even harmful information.”",

    "description": "A detailed post-mortem of the system outage that occurred on February 19, 2026, including root cause analysis and planned remediations.",
    "fullText": "On February 19, 2026 at 8:11 AM PST, Clerk experienced a service outage caused by an inefficient query plan. A routine auto analyze led to a query plan flip, which immediately reduced database performance. Slow database queries led to queuing in our request handlers, and ultimately over 95% of traffic returning 429 without being handled. The small portion of requests that reached our database returned 200, but extremely slowly.\n\nService was restored approximately 90 minutes later when the ANALYZE command was re-run manually, and the query returned to its prior plan. Shortly after, the database performance returned to normal levels.\n\nIn short, the root cause was Postgres' automatic analyze function triggering a \"query plan flip.\"\n\nFor more context, before running a particular query, Postgres relies on a system called a query planner to decide how it will efficiently find the requested data. Postgres' query planner is dynamic, so as more data is inserted, it regularly re-analyzes the database to ensure its query plans are still optimal.\n\nFor the impacted query, the planner was leveraging an unreliable statistic. Specifically, the planner was trying to determine the percent of values in a column that were NULL. For this column, the true answer was very high (99.9996%).\n\nHowever, to avoid re-reading all database rows repeatedly, the planner uses a sampling system to estimate data distribution.\n\nWhen the automatic analyze function ran, the planner's sample size was too low and it only found NULL values, which led it to erroneously conclude that 100% of the values were NULL. It then planned the query assuming that part of it would return zero non-nulls, when in fact it returned over 17,000. This new plan is considered the \"query plan flip.\"\n\nThe impacted query is run frequently enough that the unexpected traversal of 17,000 rows caused nearly all database resources to go toward this query. The reduced performance ultimately led to significant queueing, and shedding the majority of requests with status 429.\n\nWe are adding dedicated alerting for database query plan flips. This class of issue can cause sudden, severe degradation, and we need to detect it immediately rather than relying on downstream symptoms.\n\nThis would have helped us avoid the mistake of believing a customer's traffic pattern caused the issue.\n\nOur previous Session API failover mechanism was designed to trigger during Postgres outages, while the new failover is designed to trigger during any type of failure at origin.\n\nThis extra resilience will ensure users stay signed in for a wider variety of failures.\n\nWhile this new failover proved to be ready during this incident, our reliability team had not yet been fully trained how to enable it, and we have not yet instrumented automatic triggers to enable it. We expect this work to be completed within the next few weeks so it can be used confidently during any future incidents.\n\nImmediately following the incident, we increased the statistics target on the relevant table so the query planner can track a larger, more accurate sample. Later that evening, we refactored the query so the planner could take a deterministic approach in query planning.\n\nNow, we are auditing all of our queries to determine if others are at risk for inefficient planning from unstable statistics.\n\nWe heard clearly from our customers that our communication during this incident was not good enough. Status page updates were too infrequent, the initial severity label did not accurately reflect the impact many customers were experiencing, and too much time passed before the first update was posted. We take this feedback seriously.\n\nWe are formalizing our incident communication process. This includes designating a dedicated communications lead during incidents, committing to status page updates at a regular cadence even when the situation is unchanged, and ensuring that severity labels on the status page accurately reflect customer impact. We are also improving our incident tooling so that updates are cross-posted to social channels to reach customers faster.\n\nWe are deeply sorry for the disruption this incident caused to your team, your business, and your users. We understand that you depend on Clerk to be available, and we failed to meet that expectation yesterday, and too many times in recent months.\n\nThis is unacceptable, and we will be bringing increased attention to proactively adding monitors, redundancies, and failovers to our overall system. While we've added many throughout the past year, recent events have made it clear that we are not moving fast enough.\n\nThank you for your patience and continued partnership.",

And it seemed that he was always looking up.\n\n“I just didn’t want to be that person sticking out in a negative way,” he said. “I just had to get this out of my head.”\n\nThen, two years ago, he came across some videos on TikTok about height surgery, a procedure in which the leg bones are fractured and implanted with devices that slowly stretch them over several months, resulting in longer legs.\n\nLimb-lengthening has been practiced by orthopedic surgeons for decades as a means of correcting deformities or length discrepancies. But in height surgery, also called stature-lengthening, it can be used for patients who wish to add a few inches to their height. The cosmetic procedure has grabbed more attention recently. Patient numbers are difficult to track, but four clinics in the United States said that they had received an uptick in interest over the past decade.\n\nMr. Trinh, an engineering student and ultramarathon runner from Houston, knew the surgery carried the risk of complications. Bones could heal poorly, making them more fragile, or harden at rates that could cause discrepancies. His muscles could be tightened or weakened. There was risk of infection, fat embolism and permanent nerve damage. And he would have to avoid putting weight on his legs for several months, with a full recovery taking at least half a year or longer.\n\nThe risks have made height surgery a contentious topic, and the procedure is expensive. It can cost between $70,000 and $150,000 in the United States, driving some people to seek treatment abroad. Mr. Trinh decided to consult a clinic in Florida. His father, Tan, one of the first people he confided in about his insecurity, used his savings to front the $140,000 or so his son needed for the procedure and associated costs.\n\nTan, who is 5-foot-2, said he could understand his son’s feelings, having struggled with his own. “It’s a kind of stigma,” he said, “and I just feel so bad.” He didn’t want his son to go through life with the same “mental suffering.”\n\nThey booked the surgery for May 2025.\n\nAaron said that it was an uncomfortable topic. He and his father didn’t even tell his mother about the surgery until they had already paid for it, he said.\n\n“The biggest response a lot of people are going to get is, ‘Dude, you can’t change your height — just learn to be confident in yourself,’” said Mr. Trinh, who did not believe that psychological therapy would have helped him. “It’s easier said than done.”\n\nCosmetic surgery has become an increasingly mainstream topic of conversation in recent years, thanks in part to social media and a rising cultural comfort with aesthetic intervention. Public figures have acknowledged breast augmentations, face-lifts and other major procedures. Clinics have directly marketed their services to consumers online.\n\nHeight surgery has likewise attracted attention, used recently as a plot point in the film “Materialists” and fodder for online debate.\n\nEven among cosmetic interventions, the intensity required to become taller has roused divisions. The idea of breaking healthy bones in pursuit of an ideal height can seem extreme, if not absurd. And the potential to alter one’s height ties into a charged conversation about its significance, particularly for many men, in dating and at work.\n\nMr. Trinh is one of only a few who have been fully open about their experiences, driven by the hope that others interested in height surgery might feel less shame.\n\nAt least four height surgery patients The New York Times spoke to requested anonymity to share their experience because they had not told family, friends or colleagues. One man, who went to Turkey for his surgery, explained his crutches by telling friends he’d had back surgery or an accident. After his return, issues including poor bone healing eventually pushed him to seek out an orthopedic surgeon in Baltimore.\n\nIt felt bad to lie, he said, and he was sure his relatives had noticed he was taller. But he said he had few regrets, and planned to take his secret “to the grave.”\n\n“I wasn’t designed to be tall, but I’d like to be normal,” said Presley St. James, 31, who lives in Pennsylvania. As a child, Mr. St. James had been diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency and his mother had decided against growth hormone therapy.\n\nBut he felt that his height, 5-foot-4, had made him a bullying target at work. He had dreams of being an actor, and worried that he was too short.\n\nHis endocrine disorder meant that insurance covered much of his procedure, he said, though he is an exception: Insurance rarely covers the procedure for cosmetic reasons.\n\n“A lot of guys like to say, Well, I’m fine with just the way that I am,” said Mr. St. James, who started stature-lengthening last August. “Deep down inside, no they’re not.”\n\nHeight, an attribute that is largely set by adolescence, can be a sensitive issue for those who consider themselves short. Researchers have correlated being taller with greater income, high-status jobs and positive perceptions of leadership. And it can be a thorny topic in an era of dating apps that can filter for height preferences.\n\nAdults have long resorted to shoe lifts or high heels. Those seeking more permanent results have pursued growth hormone therapy, which can add height when prescribed for children, but is also much debated. And they have turned to the field of limb-lengthening, where equipment has advanced.\n\n“People have been bothered by height for a long time,” said Dr. Dror Paley, a surgeon and the founder of the Paley Orthopedic & Spine Institute in West Palm Beach, Fla. He began performing limb-lengthening in the 1980s after training under Dr. Gavriil Ilizarov, a physician in the former Soviet Union who invented one method. “This was the beginning of being able to do something about it,” Dr. Paley said.\n\nThe technique offered a new, if painfully arduous, pathway for people to correct medical problems in their limbs. But soon, Dr. Paley said, he was approached by people who wanted the procedure for cosmetic reasons.\n\nHe did it quietly at first, he said, and made his patients undergo a psychological evaluation. Orthopedic surgeons, he said, are trained to treat pain and disability rather than cosmetic problems. These days, he is one of a small group of orthopedic surgeons worldwide who offer cosmetic stature surgery and believes the field is in its “infancy.”\n\nThe way people feel about their height is “really personal,” said Dr. Ellen Katz Westrich, a licensed clinical psychologist in New York. And it can be influenced by early experiences, environment and personality traits.\n\nOver the years, Dr. Katz Westrich has evaluated multiple prospective height surgery patients to help them decide what was best for them. “They’ll describe it as like the dull hum that just doesn’t go away,” she said. “I’ve heard it described to me as, ‘I’m a tall person in the body of a short person.’”\n\nDr. Katz Westrich said that her role was to help patients, not promote height surgery. Surgery, she said, is generally not advised for people who experience body dysmorphic disorder, a mental health condition that can be better treated with cognitive behavior therapy or serotonin-enhancing drugs.\n\nBut for patients set on it, the procedure seemed to address their chronic height-related distress, she said. “I think for some people, the concrete fix does the trick.”\n\nThere is limited research on the long-term outcomes for cosmetic height surgery patients, and orthopedic groups have called for more rigorous studies to assess its risks and benefits. (Patients in small-scale studies have suggested psychological improvements in the short term, but it is unclear if they last.)\n\n“This is an elective procedure with potentially lifelong consequences that are not yet fully characterized,” said Michelle Spear, a professor of anatomy at the University of Bristol in England. “We don’t quite yet know what’s going to happen.”\n\nStill, several U.S. clinics have reported rising interest over the past decade. In Las Vegas, Mario Moya, chief executive at the LimbplastX Institute, said demand had surged in the past four years. Dr. S. Robert Rozbruch, an orthopedic surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, said he had observed a boom since 2011, after new equipment hit the market. Before that year, Dr. Paley said that he had seen about 10 cases a year of cosmetic limb-lengthening. Last year, his clinics had 155 cases.\n\nDr. Michael Assayag, an orthopedic surgeon at the International Center for Limb Lengthening in Baltimore, said he was once against height surgery. Now, he sees about 45 height-surgery patients a year. He said he had changed his mind after seeing patients who came to him with tricky complications, such as poor bone healing.\n\n“I realized people are going to get it no matter what,” he said, adding that he believed he could offer a safer environment to complete the procedure.\n\nThere is no standard protocol on height surgery, and the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons has not issued official clinical guidelines on the procedure. (Clinics in countries like Turkey, where procedures can cost half as much, have marketed packages to patients seeking height surgery from abroad.)\n\nProf. Tim Briggs, a British health official, warned people against going abroad for cosmetic limb-lengthening. “Don’t gamble with your health or your life for a few extra inches without fully understanding the risks,” Professor Briggs said.\n\nSome patients have mixed feelings. The process has been frustrating for Mr. St. James, the Pennsylvania man, who said his care had taken a toll on the family. “Did I really make a good decision doing this,” he wondered, after a checkup last fall. “Or was it a big mistake?” (In February, he said in a text message that he was feeling “fairly optimistic.”)\n\nIn rarer cases, the outcomes of poor limb-lengthening treatment can be disastrous.\n\nLast month, a leading children’s hospital in London apologized after it said that substandard care from an orthopedic surgeon who specialized in limb-lengthening and reconstruction had harmed 94 patients. Some children, who were treated between 2017 and 2022, were left with chronic pain or deformities, according to British news media. The surgeon, Yaser Jabbar, has reportedly left the U.K.; a representative declined to comment.\n\nOn the day of surgery, Mr. Trinh said, his hands shook so much that it was hard for nurses to put in an IV drip.\n\nIt was his first time in surgery. Over less than two hours, a surgeon would break his femurs and, through small incisions, implant rods inside the bones.\n\nThe pain came when the nerve blockers and epidural wore off, in his thighs and at the incision sites. It would be weeks before he would sleep well.\n\nBut that was only the beginning. A week after the surgery, he began “lengthening” — using a magnetic apparatus on the outside of his legs to separate the bones. The goal was to do it four times a day, a quarter of a millimeter each time, alongside a rigorous regimen of physical therapy.\n\nAt the Paley Institute Stature Center, patients must stay locally for several months to attend regular checkups. Mr. Trinh booked himself into a nearby hotel popular with other patients. On weekdays, a pink bus shuttles patients at various stages of healing — some using crutches and others in wheelchairs — from the hotel’s lobby to their appointments.\n\nChallenges come in the postoperative stage, Dr. Paley said, adding that surgeons needed to anticipate and respond to potential complications.\n\n“Patients are greedy for length, and they will push you to keep lengthening at the risk of losing function,” he said. “The doctor has to be steadfast in resisting that.”\n\nMr. Trinh had ways to pass the time during his many hours of recuperation. He began a long-distance master’s degree at Texas A&M University. He joined a chat group with other hotel guests who were also patients. “The outside world will think that you’re crazy for doing this, but here you’re meeting people who have the same goals,” he said.\n\nAnd he meticulously logged his progress and his symptoms, sharing them for other members of a Discord server dedicated to limb-lengthening.\n\nIts creator, Victor Egonu, a former limb-lengthening patient, said he wanted his platform, Cyborg 4 Life, to help prospective patients understand the realities of height surgery.\n\nFor most patients, the procedure was a “private thing,” Mr. Egonu said. “That’s where they can congregate and talk to each other about it and socialize without doing it in person.”\n\nThough uncomfortable, Mr. Trinh seemed to be healing well at first. “Day 29,” he wrote. “Sleep continues to be all over the place.”\n\nBut the discomfort crossed into agony on Day 56, when his left shin was burning. “NERVE PAIN IS THE WORST,” he wrote.\n\nMr. Trinh paused the regimen. Lying in a hotel room with ice on his leg, he felt low. It was not yet his goal — an extra 7.5 centimeters, or about three inches — but he feared doing permanent damage to his nerves.\n\nOthers on the Discord chat said that they, too, had experienced nerve damage, and encouraged him to stay positive.\n\nTo his relief, the burning subsided after a few days. He pushed on.\n\nFive months after his surgery, Mr. Trinh went for his final checkup with Dr. Craig Robbins, the surgeon who had overseen his lengthening. He was still using crutches, but he could walk.\n\nAnd he was now exactly 5-foot-9, around the average height for an American man.\n\nMr. Trinh was not yet fully finished with the process. The implants in his bones needed to be removed. His left shin, he said, was still partly numb, which he had accepted could be permanent. He still felt tightness in his pelvis when he jogged.\n\nIn January, eight months after his surgery, Mr. Trinh went for a 22 mile hike at a forest in Texas. And he was surprised at how much better he felt in cargo shorts.\n\nHis recovery, he said, had gone particularly well. (Some patients on the same timeline were still working their way up to jogging, he said.)\n\nPeople who knew him noticed, of course, that he was taller. He was truthful with some, and he held back with others. But the “itch” in his mind about his height, he said, was gone.\n\n“I’m just perfectly average, where I need to be,” he said. ”It’s a nice feeling.”\n\nHe wondered sometimes whether his legs still looked proportionate. He had not yet ruled out a second surgery, this time on his tibias, to correct his bow legs.\n\nIt would be a bonus, he said, if it made him even taller.\n\nMatt Yan contributed reporting.\n\nAudio produced by Tally Abecassis.",

    "fullText": "Company behind ChatGPT last year flagged Jesse Van Rootselaar’s account for ‘furtherance of violent activities’\n\nChatGPT-maker OpenAI has said it considered alerting Canadian police last year about the activities of a person who months later committed one of the worst school shootings in the country’s history.\n\nOpenAI said last June the company identified the account of Jesse Van Rootselaar via abuse detection efforts for “furtherance of violent activities”.\n\nThe San Francisco tech company said on Friday it considered whether to refer the account to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) but determined at the time that the account activity did not meet a threshold for referral to law enforcement.\n\nOpenAI banned the account in June 2025 for violating its usage policy.\n\nThe 18-year-old killed eight people in a remote part of British Columbia last week and died from a self-inflicted gun shot wound.\n\nOpenAI said the threshold for referring a user to law enforcement was whether the case involved an imminent and credible risk of serious physical harm to others. The company said it did not identify credible or imminent planning. The Wall Street Journal first reported OpenAI’s revelation.\n\nOpenAI said that, after learning of the school shooting, employees reached out to the RCMP with information on the individual and their use of ChatGPT.\n\n“Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the Tumbler Ridge tragedy,” an OpenAI spokesperson said. “We proactively reached out to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with information on the individual and their use of ChatGPT, and we’ll continue to support their investigation.”\n\nThe RCMP said Van Rootselaar first killed her mother and stepbrother at the family home before attacking the nearby school. Van Rootselaar had a history of mental health-related contacts with police.\n\nThe motive for the shooting remains unclear.\n\nThe town of 2,700 people in the Canadian Rockies is more than 1,000km (600 miles) north-east of Vancouver, near the provincial border with Alberta.\n\nPolice said the victims included a 39-year-old teaching assistant and five students, aged 12 to 13.\n\nThe attack was Canada’s deadliest rampage since 2020, when a gunman in Nova Scotia killed 13 people and set fires that left another nine dead.",

    "title": "Legendary SF Author Harlan Ellison Had Nothing but Harsh Words About Star Wars",
    "description": "Harlan Ellison is one of the most influential voices in science-fiction history, and he was vocally not a fan of Star Wars.",
    "fullText": "We may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\n\nMost stories one reads about the legendary sci-fi author Harlan Ellison tend to be about how cranky and/or litigious he was. Harlan Ellison hated Hollywood. The stories about his dissatisfaction with \"Star Trek\" are legendary, and he often took other writers and/or studios to court, claiming they had ripped off his idea. He once sued the makers of the obscure 1970s sci-fi cop show \"Future Cop,\" and he famously (and successfully) sued James Cameron over \"The Terminator.\" He sued the movie \"In Time\" for \"borrowing\" one of his ideas. And in interviews, Ellison remained cantankerous. A notable 1979 interview with the Comics Journal revealed the man's open hatred for studios' habit of stealing other authors' ideas and claiming them as their own.\n\nIn 1989, Ellison published a book of reviews and essays called \"Harlan Ellison's Watching,\" which compiled 25 years of his ancillary nonfiction writing output. He weighed in on various pop sci-fi films and TV shows, adding his two acidic cents to the otherwise genteel conversation. It was never a secret that Harlan Ellison hated George Lucas' 1977 sci-fi opera \"Star Wars,\" as he would make passing mention of it in ancillary interviews, but in \"Watching,\" he got to lay his opinions bare in an essay entitled \"Luke Skywalker Is A Nerd And Darth Vader Sucks Runny Eggs.\" As one can tell, Ellison was not about to launch into a paean about the glories of Lucas' Skywalker saga. He was about to lay out, in explicit detail, just how much he hated \"Star Wars\" and why.\n\nIn brief, Ellison felt that \"Star Wars\" was shallow and thoughtless, not interested in anything complex or adult. Because it was a mere adventure, it didn't fully exploit the depths of its own genre.\n\nThe Grailrunner website printed some passages from Harlan Ellison's essay, and boy howdy are they harsh. Ellison hated that sci-fi, a genre he associated with imagination, ambition, and philosophy, was being wielded to tell a mere swashbuckling adventure pic. He called \"Star Wars\" \"some half-wit wild west adventure in outer space.\" He said that Hollywood doesn't know the difference between making a sci-fi movie and making any other genre. Sci-fi is \"just another shoot-'em-up with laser rifles.\" He wrote:\n\n\"For all of its length, for all of its astonishing technical expertise, its headlong plunge and its stunning effects, at no time can one discern the passage of a thought. It is all bread and circuses. The human heart is never touched, the lives unexamined, the characters are comic strip stereotypes.\"\n\nAnd he does have a point. The first \"Star Wars,\" taken independently from its many, many sequels, most closely resembles the 1930s sci-fi adventure serials that George Lucas watched as a kid. The characters are quite deliberately archetypal and even a little arch and artificial. The original \"Star Wars\" is using modern special effects and 1970s filmmaking tech to link up contemporary cinema with older, squarer filmic traditions from decades previous. There is no moral nuance or complexity to \"Star Wars.\" It's an adventure novel, a \"heroes and villains\" story. Ellison seemingly felt that devoting all that time and all those cinematic resources to a story about comic book stereotypes was a waste of time.\n\nSci-fi was, as Ellison wrote, a \"what if\" genre that probes the possibilities of broad, high-concept ideas. What if we were all psychic? What if we met aliens? There is, one might agree, no \"what if\" quality to \"Star Wars.\" It's a caper film.\n\nHarlan Ellison was keen to recommend sci-fi movies that he felt did explore the genre in interesting ways. He liked the movie \"Charly.\" He liked \"1984,\" of course. He also recommended L.Q. Jones' 1975 film \"A Boy and His Dog\" ... which is based on one of his own short stories. Ellison was famously not fond of Stanley Kubrick's seminal sci-fi text \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" as he felt it was too focused on its visuals, and not its humanity. He wrote:\n\n\"[A]ll the films that we thought were great, like '2001,' become, in retrospect, merely exercises in special effects. There are damned few 'people' stories that deal with what science fiction at its best and most valuable handles better than any other kind of story: the effects on human beings of technology, unusual happenings and the future.\"\n\nOne of Ellison's biggest issues with \"Star Wars\" was how uncritical the public seemed to be. He hated that NASA scientists were singing its praises, and that a friend, author Ben Bova, dared to give it a good review. He saw no dissenting voices among the rising tide of what would come to be known as \"the fandom.\" He wrote:\n\n\"I sincerely hope that science and scientists differ from science fiction and its practitioners. Heaven help us if they don't: we may be headed for a very boring world indeed. Strip 'Star Wars' of its often striking images and its highfalutin scientific jargon, and you get a story, characters, and dialogue of overwhelming banality ... trite characters and paltry verbiage ... Still, 'Star Wars' will do very nicely for those lucky enough to be childish or unlucky enough never to have grown up.\"",

    "fullText": "After meeting with unspecified tech leaders, senator calls for urgent policy action as companies race to build ever more powerful systems\n\nBernie Sanders has warned that Congress and the American public have “not a clue” about the scale and speed of the coming AI revolution, pressing for urgent policy action to “slow this thing down” as tech companies race to build ever-more powerful systems.\n\nSpeaking at Stanford University on Friday alongside congressman Ro Khanna after a series of meetings with industry leaders in California, Sanders was blunt about what he called the “most dangerous moment in the modern history of this country”.\n\n“The Congress and the American people are very unprepared for the tsunami that is coming,” he said.\n\nKhanna, a progressive Democrat who represents Silicon Valley, shared Sanders’s concerns, warning that the country was experiencing a “new gilded age” run by tech billionaires who believe “they would have been heroic conquerors in a different era”.\n\n“That’s just not my observation,” Khanna said. “That’s what they tell me.”\n\nKhanna and Sanders declined to specify which tech executives they met with during the senator’s visit to California, but the congressman said it was “senior leaders” at the “most prominent tech companies”.\n\n“I think it was important for both Senator Sanders to hear from tech leaders and tech leaders to hear from Senator Sanders, who represents and understands the concerns of so many working-class Americans,” Khanna said in an interview after the event.\n\nDuring his remarks, Sanders reissued his call for a moratorium on the expansion of AI data centers to “slow down the revolution and protect workers” while policymakers catch up.\n\nKhanna does not want a moratorium, but has instead pushed to “steer” AI, advocating for the US to adopt a “Singapore model” for data center growth, with an emphasis on renewable energy and water efficiency. In his remarks before an auditorium of mostly students, Khanna outlined seven principles to guard against “oligarchic capture and dominance” of wealth generated by AI innovation.\n\n“We must ask not what America can do for Silicon Valley, but what Silicon Valley must do for America,” said the congressman, who is eyed as considering a 2028 presidential bid.\n\nThe event capped a days-long visit to California, a state he won in the 2020 presidential primary and where he returned to rally thousands during his Fight Oligarchy tour last year. In Los Angeles on Wednesday, Sanders delivered a scathing denunciation of the “greed” of the billionaire class. There he helped formally launch a campaign for a ballot initiative that would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents worth more than $1bn – a proposal that has already prompted some ultra-wealthy tech leaders to flee, or threaten to do so.\n\nAt Stanford, Sanders focused his remarks on his concerns over how AI would impact not only the labor force but personal wellbeing and people’s ability to interact with one another. He mentioned that a restaurant in DC offered a Valentine’s Day special for people and their “AI buddies”, which drew laughs from the students.\n\nIt may seem funny, Sanders said, “but the truth is that a lot of people are becoming dependent upon AI for their emotional support. What is the long-term impact of that? What is the long-term impact if we lose work as an important part of our lives? What do we do with our lives?”\n\nSanders read statements from industry leaders who have predicted widespread automation, and cited projections that AI and robotics could eliminate tens of millions of jobs in the coming decade – from truck drivers to fast‑food workers and many white‑collar roles.\n\nPolling has found Americans are deeply concerned, as federal regulators and states debate how to impose guardrails on the nascent but fast-developing technology. A 2025 Pew survey found that 64% of the public thinks AI “will lead to fewer jobs over the next 20 years”. Just 17% of Americans say “AI will have a very or somewhat positive impact on the United States” over the same period.\n\nThe tech CEOs leading the AI race have argued that AI will drive productivity, innovation and new kinds of employment as technological advancements have always done. But critics, like Sanders, say the “unprecedented” speed and scale of the changes threaten to enrich the “multibillionaires” while deepening inequality and leaving policymakers and the public ill-equipped to mount a response in time.\n\nSander urged his colleagues in Washington – and the public – to begin a serious public debate about the future of work as AI disrupts the economy, democracy and people’s emotional lives.\n\n“AI and robotics are neither good nor bad,” he said. “The question is: will a handful of billionaires benefit from it, or will the general public benefit?”",

    "fullText": "Iran has shown how plausible blackouts now are, with far-reaching consequences for the internet as we know it\n\nDuring the height of Iran’s blackout in January, people could still access a platform that, in some senses, was like the internet.\n\nIranians could message family members on a government-monitored app and watch clips of Manchester United on a Farsi-language video-sharing site. They could read state news and use a local navigation service.\n\nWhat they couldn’t do was check international headlines about thousands of people being killed by government forces during one of the bloodiest weeks in recent Iranian history. Nor, for the most part, could they get evidence out of Iran to the outside world – no pictures, no videos, no testimony of military vehicles being driven into protesters or family members being dragged from their homes and shot.\n\nWhat Iran has, a splinternet, is becoming reality for many millions of people. It is likely to get far worse.\n\nMore than half of Russia’s regions are able to access only a limited, government-approved version of the internet through their mobile phones. The “great firewall of China” blocks most of the global internet, including sites such as Google and the Guardian. The Myanmar junta has experimented with targeted internet shutdowns and so recently have authorities in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nFor nearly two decades, the US backed a global effort to make it extremely difficult for governments to divide up the internet in this way. It hinged on funding tools built by groups worldwide to circumvent censorship. These made it very costly and very hard to shut down the internet entirely, and they ensured that governments that did seek to cut off their people often had to isolate themselves and their financial institutions as well.\n\nLike many US soft-power initiatives, the programme was imperfect, morally complex and at times at odds with the policies of other governments. Yet it is one foundation of what the internet is: a global commons. Today’s online world is dominated by large tech platforms and awash with illegal content and misinformation. But it is still a structure in which facts, ideas and information accessible from London are largely accessible from Delhi, Johannesburg and São Paulo as well.\n\nThat could change rapidly. On the one hand is the matter of US funding, now cut or apparently redirected towards a Trumpian, politicised effort to undermine global attempts to regulate US big-tech platforms.\n\nOn the other is the mounting export of censorship technologies, which are constantly improving and increasingly marketed overseas. These include devices sold by companies in China that give their customers – governments in Pakistan, Myanmar and Ethiopia among others – extremely fine-tuned control over what comes in and out of a country. It is believed that similar technologies are the foundation of Iran’s current shutdown.\n\nCensorship technologies are growing more powerful at the same time as programmes designed to stymie them have been decimated.\n\nTo those who work on the problem, the stakes are high. “When governments want to not be scrutinised for how many people they’re killing in their streets, they’ll shut the internet down,” said a former US official.\n\nIt is not easy to build a splinternet. The internet is, by design, a decentralised and deeply inter-dependent network. But Iran’s recent example indicates that it is becoming far more plausible. Russia has been attempting to create a similar cut-off internet for some years, and other authoritarian regimes appear to share the ambition. It will become cheaper and easier to achieve.\n\nGovernments worldwide, including in Europe, are promoting notions of sovereign data, sovereign AI and, in some cases, sovereign internet. Accompanying this is an ambition to nationalise infrastructure, for example to keep UK citizens’ health records stored in UK data centres. This is an understandable goal, given the increasingly authoritarian bent of US tech platforms that are the custodians of much of the world’s data.\n\nBut if fascist or authoritarian regimes ascend, such an approach risks replacing one set of despots with another. Iran’s ability to cut off its internet was prefigured by a years-long push to nationalise its underlying infrastructure. Shutdowns such as Iran’s become far easier when a country’s data is entirely accessible to its domestic authorities.\n\nThose fighting for digital freedoms in harsh environments – in Iran and beyond – are approaching Europe, hoping the EU might pick up some of what the US has dropped and fund anticensorship technologies.\n\nIt is doubtful that Europe has the money or the willpower to do much, given the other responsibilities it must shoulder. Next to defence, it seems a marginal concern. But the information environment as we know it – the ground of shared fact that allowed this piece to be written and you to read it – is at stake.",

    "description": "If you're paying $100/month but consuming multiples of that in value, you have to start wondering when that's going to catch up to you. The AI coding tool market is following a familiar playbook.",
    "fullText": "Sometimes the math doesn’t math. If you’re paying $100/month on a Claude Code Max plan, but are consuming way more than that, you have to start wondering when that’s going to catch up to you.\n\nNo, it’s not a bug. It’s a business model. And if you’ve been around long enough to remember when an Uber from Manhattan to JFK was $25, you already know how this story ends.\n\nRight now, Claude Code’s Max plan runs $100/month for what Anthropic’s own docs describe as roughly $100–200/developer/month in actual API token costs at average usage. But “average” is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence. Power users are burning through multiples of that.\n\nAnthropic knows this. They’ve even been somewhat transparent about it. Their average daily cost per developer sits around $6 in credits, with 90% of users staying below $12. But heavy users, the ones building real things, running agentic workflows, spinning up multi-file reasoning sessions? They’re consuming far more value than they’re paying for.\n\n“This isn’t generosity. This is market capture.”\n\nUber lost more than $30 billion in the years since the company’s finances became public, amounting to an enormous, investor-fueled subsidy of America’s ride-hailing habit. In 2015, Uber passengers were only paying about 41% of the actual cost of their trips. The strategy was straightforward. Make the product so cheap and so convenient that it becomes infrastructure. Then, once alternatives have been starved out and habits are locked in, raise prices.\n\nIt worked. Average Uber prices rose 92% between 2018 and 2021. Kevin Roose at the New York Times called the original pricing a “millennial lifestyle subsidy” and framed the eventual correction not as price-gouging but as the market finally reflecting reality.\n\nThe AI coding tool market is following the same playbook. Anthropic just closed a $30 billion Series G at a $380 billion valuation. Their annualized revenue hit over $9 billion by end of 2025. They’re projecting revenue could quadruple this year to as much as $18 billion. But they’re still burning significant cash, and now expect to turn cash-flow positive in 2028, a year later than previously planned.\n\nThat gap between revenue and profitability? You’re standing in it. Every subsidized token is venture capital money being converted into your muscle memory and workflow dependency.\n\nThe real cost isn’t the $100–$200/month. It’s what happens when the price reflects reality.\n\nThink about what Claude Code has become for developers who rely on it daily. It’s not a nice-to-have anymore. It’s woven into how people architect systems, debug complex issues, and reason through multi-file refactors. When your entire development workflow is optimized around a tool that costs $100 but delivers $2,000 in value, you’ve built a dependency that’s priced to change.\n\nAnd it will change. It has to. Anthropic expects to spend about $12 billion training models and another $7 billion running them in 2026 alone. No amount of venture capital makes that math work forever.\n\nWhen the correction comes, it probably won’t look like a dramatic overnight price hike. It’ll look like what we’re already starting to see. Anthropic introduced new weekly rate limits in August 2025, primarily targeting power users. 5-hour usage windows that reset unpredictably. Token caps that force you to choose between using Opus for the hard problems or Sonnet for everything. Death by a thousand paper cuts until the plan that used to feel unlimited feels very, very limited.\n\nThis isn’t a “don’t use Claude Code” argument. The tool is genuinely powerful. The question is whether you’re building awareness of your dependency into how you work.\n\nA few things worth thinking about.\n\nAnthropic has begun preparations for a potential IPO as soon as 2026, hiring Wilson Sonsini to advise on the process. The revenue growth is real and impressive. But so was Uber’s.\n\nThe question isn’t whether AI coding tools are valuable. They obviously are. The question is what happens when the price tag matches the value. When the $100/month plan becomes $300/month, or usage-based pricing becomes the only option, or the rate limits get tight enough that you’re effectively paying per-task anyway.\n\nWe’re in a window right now where the economics of these tools are artificially favorable. That window will close. Not because anyone is being deceptive, but because the math demands it.\n\nThe developers who come out ahead won’t be the ones who got the most subsidized tokens. They’ll be the ones who used this window to build workflows that are observable, portable, and resilient. The ones who tracked what they consumed, understood what it really cost, and built systems that don’t have a single point of failure at the inference layer.\n\n“The best time to audit your AI dependencies is before the price correction. Not after.”\n\nGet updates on open source and distributed systems in AI infrastructure.",

    "description": "The stainless steel pickup truck is Tesla's first real flop.",
    "fullText": "Last night, Tesla made some hefty cuts to Cybertruck pricing in an effort to stimulate some sales. The bombastic tri-motor “Cyberbeast” is $15,000 cheaper at $99,990, albeit by dropping some previously free features like supercharging and FSD. And there’s now a new $59,990 entry-level model, a dual-motor configuration with a range of 325 miles (523 km) and the same 4.1-second 0–60 mph (0-97 km/h) time as the $79,990 premium all-wheel drive version.\n\nThat actually makes the new entry-level model a good deal, at least in terms of Cybertrucks. Last year, the company introduced and then eliminated a single-motor rear-wheel drive variant, which found few takers when priced at $69,990; an extra motor for $10,000 less is quite a savings, and actually slightly cheaper than the price originally advertised for the RWD truck.\n\nAs you might expect, Tesla has made some changes to get down to the new price. The range and 0–60 mph time might be the same as the more expensive dual-motor Cybertruck, but towing capacity is reduced from 11,000 lbs (4,990 kg) to 7,000 lbs (3,175kg), and cargo capacity drops from 2,500 lbs (1,134 kg) to 2,006 lbs (910 kg).\n\nSteel springs and adaptive dampers replace the air suspension. There are different tail lights. The inside features textile seats—maybe someone there reads Ars—but the cheapest Cybertruck does without seat ventilation for the front row or seat heaters for the second row. There’s also a different console, no AC outlets in the cabin, and fewer speakers, with no active noise-cancellation system.\n\nBut it’s still $20,000 more expensive than Elon Musk told us it would be during the angular, unpainted vehicle’s reveal back in 2019. Back then, Musk promised a $39,900 price tag, as well as a few other things that never saw the light of day, like a true monocoque construction.\n\nDesigning and building the odd-looking vehicle proved particularly troublesome for Tesla, which has never found those processes particularly easy. While other new Tesla models found themselves mired in “production hell,” in 2023, Musk said that “we dug our own grave with the Cybertruck.”\n\nIndeed, if the company based its business plans on the public sales projections of 250,000 trucks a year—something Musk said would happen by 2025—that certainly would be a problem.\n\nAppealing to neither traditional pickup truck buyers, who have largely rejected going to electric vehicles, nor the majority of EV enthusiasts even before Musk’s politics further soured things, fewer than 39,000 Cybertrucks were sold in 2024, and just over 20,000 found homes in 2025. The Edsel might be Ford’s most famous failure, but even it posted superior sales numbers during its relatively brief life.",

    "fullText": "\"Kids, you don't know what the f*** it is.\"\n\nThat's how Bill Maher opened his latest take on Western civilization during Friday night's episode of Real Time — and by \"kids,\" he meant two of the biggest pop stars on the planet.\n\nThe HBO host singled out Billie Eilish and Chappell Roan by name, accusing them of reducing everything about the West to a story of oppression while benefiting from the very freedoms it created. It was the kind of segment that splits the internet clean in half — and within hours, it was already doing exactly that.\n\nMaher didn't ease into it. He told his audience that young people \"think Western means white and white means bad,\" then argued that atrocities aren't unique to European history, pointing to Imperial Japan and Genghis Khan.\n\nHe then turned his attention directly to the two Grammy-winning artists. \"Don't ask Billie Eilish or Chappell Roan about what the Western values are, because they'll just say it's about oppression,\" Maher said. \"But it's not about oppression.\"\n\nBill Maher fires back at Billie Eilish and leftist “kids” who “don’t know what the f*ck” America is about.\n\n“I want to… say something about Western civilization. Kids, you don’t know what the f*ck it is.”\n\n“They think Western means white—and white means bad. First of all,… pic.twitter.com/27QlAYxKkK\n\n— Vigilant Fox 🦊 (@VigilantFox) February 21, 2026\n\nInstead, he listed what he believes the West actually stands for: \"Rule of law. Respect for minorities. Democracy. Scientific inquiry.\" He called them \"good things that came from the Western world\" and added, \"I wish that schools would teach that again.\"\n\nThe comments built on Maher's earlier attack on Eilish's viral Grammy speech, where the 24-year-old declared \"no one is illegal on stolen land\" while accepting Song of the Year. At the time, he told her she \"didn't go to school\" and \"doesn't know facts.\"\n\nFriday made it clear he wasn't done.\n\nHere's where the story gets more complicated — and more interesting.\n\nWhile Maher was framing Roan as someone who reduces the West to oppression, Roan was making headlines for something else entirely. Earlier this month, she became the most prominent artist to leave the Wasserman talent agency after its founder Casey Wasserman was named in the latest batch of Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\nRoan didn't stay quiet about it. She said she refused to \"passively stand by\" and that \"no artist, agent or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values.\" Her exit triggered an industry-wide exodus — Laufey, Weyes Blood, Orville Peck, and others followed — and may have contributed to Wasserman announcing he's selling the agency.\n\nIn other words, the young woman Maher says doesn't understand values was busy holding a powerful industry figure accountable while much of Hollywood stayed silent.\n\nAs for Eilish, the singer Maher says \"didn't go to school\" has directed $11.5 million in proceeds from her Hit Me Hard and Soft tour toward climate and hunger relief — and picked up an Environmental Justice Award at the annual MLK Jr. Beloved Community ceremony in Atlanta earlier this year.\n\nNone of this came up on Friday night.\n\nMaher has been making this argument since at least 2023, and he's been consistent: the West gave us liberal values, and young progressives are too focused on historical wrongs to appreciate it.\n\nBut there's always been an irony baked in. Maher is a self-described atheist who made the 2008 documentary Religulous mocking organized religion — yet the values he credits to Western civilization are ones many scholars trace directly to Judeo-Christian thought. Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro said as much to Maher's face on Real Time last September, telling him he was \"born morally on third base\" thanks to a biblical tradition he dismisses. Maher pushed back, crediting the Enlightenment. The audience sided with Shapiro.\n\nThe segment spread fast — and so did the reactions. One post sharing the segment racked up over 246,000 views and 12,000 likes in just three hours — and the reactions were anything but polite.\n\nMaher's supporters came out swinging. One user praised him as \"infuriatingly likable,\" adding that Maher was right \"even if I normally and fundamentally disagree with him.\" Another noted he seemed to have \"lost patience with the far left\" entirely, pointing out that the same man who's clashed with conservatives for decades was now having a polite conversation with Lauren Boebert.\n\nThe sharpest pushback came from those who think Maher is aiming at the wrong target. A 70-year-old man lecturing 24-year-old women about what they don't know is a tough look to begin with — and critics didn't let it slide. One user wrote that \"the problem isn't that young people hate the West\" — it's that \"they were handed a system that preaches freedom but delivers debt and burnout and then told to be grateful for it.\" Another was more blunt: \"Old guy screaming about Billie Eilish. Just say that. It's faster.\"\n\nOthers didn't spare anyone. One called Maher a \"broken clock\" that \"has started ticking slowly\" — not right most of the time, but overlapping more than before.\n\nIf Maher's goal was to start a conversation about what Western civilization means to the generation inheriting it — mission accomplished. Whether anyone's actually listening to the other side is a different question entirely.",

    "description": "As tech CEOs predict mass job displacement, billionaire former Shark Tank star Mark Cuban just revealed the “smartest counter” to that narrative.",
    "fullText": "Despite ongoing fears that artificial intelligence could wipe out entire career fields, billionaire Mark Cuban says the concerns may be overblown—for now.\n\nThe former Shark Tank star took to X to respond to a viral clip from the All-In podcast, in which investors Jason Calacanis and Chamath Palihapitiya revealed the real-world expense of deploying AI agents to enhance productivity: In some cases AI agents are costing more than $300 per day—adding up to over $100,000 annually. For Palihapitiya, founder of Social Capital, the price has forced him to rethink the budget he’s willing to give top developers, warning that otherwise, “I’ll run out of money.”\n\nHave AI-driven layoffs materialized as predicted?\n\nHow do AI agents compare to human workers currently?\n\nWhat are the actual costs of deploying AI agents?\n\nWhy does Mark Cuban think AI won't replace workers soon?\n\nFor Cuban, that reality is the “smartest counter” he has seen so far to predictions that AI will replace large numbers of workers—at least in the short term.\n\nEven if the technology is capable, he said, companies still need to prove the economics make sense, and he’s not convinced the high price tag outweighs the value humans continue to bring.\n\n“Humans have a far greater capacity to know the outcomes of their actions,” Cuban said. “Agents, and LLMs as well, never do.”\n\nAI systems still lack real-world judgment in ways that make replacing workers risky, Cuban added. He pointed to a simple example: An 18-month-old who pushes a sippy cup off a high chair quickly learns the consequences from their parents’ reaction. AI, on the other hand, lacks awareness.\n\n“Agents can tell you the sippy cup will fall,” Cuban said. “But they have no idea of the context and what will happen next.”\n\nThe technology also lacks consistency, often “spac[ing] out” and failing to recognize why and when mistakes occur, he said—a level of competency on par with the youngest Gen Z talent.\n\n“Agents are still like college interns that come in hungover, make mistakes, and don’t take responsibility for them,” he added.\n\nTaken together, Cuban’s argument suggests that the biggest obstacle to AI replacing workers may not be the technology itself—but whether companies can trust it to perform consistently at a price that makes sense.\n\nCuban declined to elaborate further after Fortune reached out for comment.\n\nDespite AI’s current flaws, business leaders continue to warn that rapid technological advances could soon reshape the workforce.\n\nDario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, has warned that AI could disrupt half of entry-level jobs within one to five years. More recently, he suggested the technology could become capable of performing most jobs, if not all, in “much less than five years.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump warned on Friday that limited strikes against Iran are possible even as the country’s top diplomat said Tehran expects to have a proposed deal ready in the next few days following nuclear talks with the United States.\n\nIn response to a reporter's question on whether the U.S. could take limited military action as the countries negotiate, Trump said, “I guess I can say I am considering that.” A few hours later, he told reporters that Iran “better negotiate a fair deal.”\n\nEarlier Friday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a TV interview that his country was planning to finalize a draft deal in “the next two to three days” to send to Washington.\n\n“I don’t think it takes long, perhaps, in a matter of a week or so, we can start real, serious negotiations on the text and come to a conclusion,” Araghchi said on MSNOW's “Morning Joe” show.\n\nThe tensions between the longtime adversaries have ramped up as the Trump administration pushes for concessions from Iran and has built up the largest U.S. military presence in the Middle East in decades, with more warships and aircraft on the way.\n\nOn Friday, the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group passed through the Strait of Gibraltar and entered the Mediterranean Sea after being sent by Trump from the Caribbean, according to images of the ship by maritime photographers posted to social media.\n\nBoth Iran and the U.S. have signaled that they are prepared for war if talks on Tehran’s nuclear program fizzle out. “We are prepared for diplomacy, and we are prepared for negotiation as much as we are prepared for war,” Araghchi said Friday.\n\nAli Vaez, an Iran expert at the International Crisis Group, said Iran “would treat any kinetic action as an existential threat.”\n\nVaez said he doesn’t think Iran’s leaders are bluffing when they say they would retaliate, while they likely believe they could maintain their hold on power despite any U.S. airstrikes.\n\nTrump said a day earlier that he believes 10 to 15 days is “enough time” for Iran to reach a deal following recent rounds of indirect negotiations, including this week in Geneva, that made little visible progress. But the talks have been deadlocked for years after Trump’s decision in 2018 to unilaterally withdraw the U.S. from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has refused to discuss wider U.S. and Israeli demands that it scale back its missile program and sever ties to armed groups.\n\nAraghchi also said Friday that his American counterparts have not asked for zero enrichment of uranium as part of the latest round of talks, which is not what U.S. officials have said publicly.\n\n\"What we are now talking about is how to make sure that Iran’s nuclear program, including enrichment, is peaceful and will remain peaceful forever,\" he said.\n\nHe added that in return, Iran will implement some confidence-building measures in exchange for relief on economic sanctions.\n\nIn response to Araghchi’s claim, a White House official said Trump has been clear that Iran cannot have nuclear weapons or the capacity to build them and that it cannot enrich uranium. The official wasn’t authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTehran has long insisted that any negotiations should only focus on its nuclear program and that it hasn’t been enriching uranium since U.S. and Israeli strikes last June on Iranian nuclear sites. Trump said at the time that the strikes had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear sites, but the exact damage is unknown as Tehran has barred international inspectors.\n\nAlthough Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful, the U.S. and others suspect it is aimed at eventually developing weapons.\n\nTrump's comments have faced pushback from some lawmakers who say the president should get Congress' approval before any strike.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said Friday that he has filed a war powers resolution that would require that step. Though it has no chance of becoming law — in part because Trump himself would have to sign it — some bipartisan consensus has arisen recently among senators who forced votes on previous resolutions on military action in Venezuela.\n\nNone of those resolutions passed, but they were successful in showing how lawmakers are troubled by some of Trump’s aggressive foreign policy maneuvers.\n\n“If some of my colleagues support war, then they should have the guts to vote for the war, and to be held accountable by their constituents, rather than hiding under their desks,” Kaine said in a statement.\n\nAmiri reported from New York. Associated Press writers Michelle L. Price, Ben Finley, Stephen Groves and Konstantin Toropin in Washington and Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "The frightening moment an avalanche thundered down a mountainside and slammed into a train traveling through the Swiss Alps was captured by a tourist.\n\nThe dramatic incident unfolded on Feb. 17 near the popular ski resort town of Zermatt in southern Switzerland’s Valais canton.\n\nKirsten Osborne, an Australian woman living in the U.K., was on the train with other passengers when the avalanche suddenly struck, according to Storyful.\n\nShe filmed the shocking moment a massive wall of snow barreled down the mountain toward the train.\n\n9 California Skiers Still Missing After Avalanche; 6 Rescued\n\nIn the video, a child can be heard saying \"uh-oh!\" several times as the growing wave of powdery snow rapidly approaches.\n\nWithin seconds, the train is engulfed in a thick white cloud as the avalanche crashes into it and covers the window in snow, causing the train to shake.\n\nOsborne described how passengers were left stranded for around two hours following the impact.\n\n\"We were stuck for two hours before the rescue and provided bus transport to safety,\" she said.\n\nUeli Kestenholz, Who Won Snowboarding's First Olympic Medal In 1998, Dies In Swiss Avalanche\n\nDespite the terrifying scenes, no injuries were reported.\n\nMatterhorn Gotthard Bahn, the rail company that operates the route, has since confirmed that all passengers were safely evacuated in coordination with emergency services.\n\n\"At around 11 a.m. on Tuesday morning, another avalanche occurred between Täsch and Randa,\" the company said in a statement.\n\n\"A regional MGBahn train was struck by a resulting powder-snow avalanche. No one was injured. Passengers were evacuated in cooperation with the emergency services.\n\n\"As a precaution, and in consultation with external local natural hazard specialists, MGBahn has decided to suspend operations on the St. Niklaus–Täsch route until further notice,\" the company said.\n\nCalifornia Avalanche That Killed 8 Is Deadliest In State History\n\nMGBahn also confirmed it was in \"close contact with specialists and experts to assess the situation along the entire route network between Disentis (GR) and Zermatt (VS).\"\n\nThe incident happened amid dangerous winter conditions in the Swiss Alps, where heavy snowfall has impacted the tourist season.\n\nThe avalanche strike on the train came just a day after another rail incident near the town of Goppenstein, where a train derailed, injuring five people.\n\nLocal reports indicated that an avalanche may have been a possible cause of that derailment, although investigations are ongoing.\n\nLarge areas of the western Alps have been affected this season by avalanche risks, according to The Times.\n\nOriginal article",

    "description": "Utah’s Supreme Court rejected on Friday an appeal by Republican lawmakers and left in place a congressional map that gives Democrats a high chance of picking up one of the state’s four Republican-held...",
    "fullText": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utah’s Supreme Court rejected on Friday an appeal by Republican lawmakers and left in place a congressional map that gives Democrats a high chance of picking up one of the state’s four Republican-held U.S. House seats in the fall.\n\nIn the order signed by Chief Justice Matthew B. Durrant, the court explained that they do not have “jurisdiction over Legislative Defendants’ appeal.”\n\nThe lawmakers had appealed a decision in November in which a Utah judge adopted a congressional map creating a Democratic-leaning district over one poised to protect all four of the state's U.S. House seats held by Republicans.\n\nThe map keeps Salt Lake County almost entirely within one district, instead of dividing the heavily Democratic population center among all four districts, as was previously the case.\n\nRepublicans have argued the court does not have legal authority to enact a map that wasn’t approved by the Legislature.\n\nUtah’s Republican Senate President Stuart Adams pushed back on the ruling, saying the “chaos continues.\"\n\n“We will keep defending a process that respects the Constitution and ensures Utah voters across our state have their voices respected,” he said in a statement.\n\nKatharine Biele, president of the League of Women Voters of Utah, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, applauded the ruling.\n\n“We are encouraged that the court dismissed this improper appeal and allowed the process to move forward without disruption to voters or election administrators,” she said in a statement.\n\nThe redistricting stems from an August decision in which Judge Dianna Gibson struck down the Utah congressional map adopted after the 2020 census because the Legislature had circumvented anti-gerrymandering standards passed by voters.\n\nThe ruling pushed the state into a national redistricting battle as President Donald Trump urged Republican-led states to take up mid-decade redistricting to try to help the GOP retain control of the House in 2026.\n\nThe approved map gives Democrats a much stronger chance to flip a seat in a state that last had a Democrat in Congress in early 2021.\n\nEmma Petty Addams, co-executive director of Mormon Women for Ethical Government, another plaintiff in the lawsuit, said in a statement Friday that “the courts have provided an important check on the Legislature, affirming the people’s constitutional right to alter and reform their government.”\n\nThe ruling comes weeks before the deadline to file for reelection.\n\nThere is another appeal pending in federal court that was spearheaded by two of the state’s Republican members of Congress. The lawsuit filed in February argues the state judge violated the U.S. Constitution by rejecting the congressional districts drawn by the Republican-led state Legislature.",

    "fullText": "Brian Littrell’s $50,000 lawsuit against the woman he claims trespassed on his private beach property has been dismissed by a Walton County, Fla., judge.\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by Page Six, the judge dismissed the case “without prejudice” on Tuesday for “failing to state a claim for which relief can be granted.”\n\nHowever, Brian and his wife, Leighanne Littrell, have 20 days to refile an amended complaint for their case.\n\nA rep for Brian and Leighanne did not immediately respond to Page Six’s request for comment.\n\nThe couple first took legal action against Carolyn Barrington Hill on Sept. 19, 2025, accusing her of seven counts of illegal trespassing, one count of invasion of privacy and one count of stalking over incidents that took place between April 2025 through September 6, 2025. However, they later dismissed their count of stalking.\n\nThey claimed in their legal filing that Hill “ignored the no trespassing” signs on their Santa Rosa Beach property and entered the area “without right or authority.”\n\nThey alleged that Hill “set out to antagonize, bully and harass” them with her “multiple” “unauthorized entries” that started in April.\n\nBrian and Leighanne further claimed that they suffered “emotional distress” because Hill’s “trespassing” hindered their “use and enjoyment of the property.”\n\nIn the judge’s order, Littrell’s claim for emotional was dismissed because “emotional distress damages are not permitted on a claim for trespassing.”\n\nBrian and Leighanne also listed their BLB Beach Hut LLC as a plaintiff, and as a legal entity and not a person, it cannot experience emotional distress, according to the judge.\n\nIn one incident the pair accused Hill of setting up her own beach furniture on their property before she engaged in a heated exchange with their property manager.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that Hill started “shouting and cursing” at their property manager after he asked her to move her things.\n\nThey also claimed she “videotaped” them without their “knowledge or consent” and “incited” other members of the public to join her in her alleged trespassing of their property.\n\nIn addition to Hill, the Littrells also named the Walton County Sheriff’s Office in their suit for allegedly failing to enforce their private property rights.",

    "title": "NFL combine is awash with questions about veterans, not rookies. They range from Lamar Jackson to Maxx Crosby",
    "description": "While the veteran news and ramp up to free agency will cast a long shadow in Indianapolis, it won't eliminate a litany of prospect-related storylines that will get rolling once workouts begin.",
    "fullText": "Maybe it’s the quarterback chaos or the landslide of head coaching changes. Or because it’s late February and many of the NFL’s personnel departments already seem satisfied that the No. 1 overall pick in the draft is in the barn. Or maybe it’s because the 2025 season produced a wildly unexpected Super Bowl between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots, and an even more unexpected Super Bowl quarterback winner in Sam Darnold.\n\nWhatever the driving force, it’s thrusting the usual sideshow of the NFL scouting combine — trade rumors, free-agency buzz and clandestine general manager meetings — into the middle of the main stage. And with that, the college players who are taking their next big step toward draft positioning have become a subplot.\n\n“It’s going to be a wild offseason and it’s going to start next week [at the combine],” one prominent NFL agent said this week. “There’s so much more than usual with different veteran stuff compared to how guys are going to work out — and we have a good class of guys [in the draft]. All the quarterback things to figure out, some of the [veteran] defensive players — some of the young players that could be traded with the staff changes — there’s going to be a lot going on. …\n\n“I see you guys talking about storylines — when was the last time anyone checked in on what’s going on with Lamar Jackson [and the Baltimore Ravens]? It’s like that situation has gotten lost in all this noise. That’s how crazy next week is going to be, though.”\n\nIn fairness, Jackson’s potential extension deadline — spoken into existence by Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti in January — has been a prominent story over the past month. Indeed, it will crank up next week, with the quarterback and franchise having been in a contract talks window for several weeks by the time Ravens new head coach Jesse Minter and general manager Eric DeCosta meet with the media in Indianapolis. It’s expected there will be some kind of temperature gauge coming out of the combine, with the front office and ownership wanting to sign an extension with Jackson and lower his $74.5 million salary cap hit in 2026.\n\nOf course, Jackson is only one of multiple pressing maneuvers — or non-maneuvers — heading into the combine that will certainly drain some of the daily news thunder from draft prospects’ workouts. Among the prominent:\n\nWho will be getting the franchise tag applied to them before free agency, with the biggest potential name being Dallas Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens. As it stands, Dallas is expected to tag Pickens prior to the March 3 deadline and then either attempt to retain him or try to engage in a sign-and-trade scenario. With Pickens wanting to get to free agency and a likely $35 million average salary per season, there will likely be sparks in a tag scenario.\n\nPotential veteran trades, including Las Vegas Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby, Philadelphia Eagles wideout A.J. Brown, Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray and others. Throw in some young players who might get a call or two just to see if they are available on the trade market, including Buffalo Bills wideout Keon Coleman, Jacksonville Jaguars wideout Brian Thomas Jr., Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson and Minnesota Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy.\n\nThe future of Aaron Rodgers will be a pressing question for the Pittsburgh Steelers — at least as it pertains to the organization’s other options and what kind of timeline there would be for a Rodgers decision. It’s possible we exit the combine under the presumption that the Steelers are going to move forward and try to find their future QB, which would shift the Rodgers conversation back to the Vikings, whom he was interested in before landing in Pittsburgh last offseason.\n\nAnd finally, one very big nugget that has yet to be developed: How much interest there will be in Malik Willis in free agency and what the money could ultimately look like. The ballpark speculation in the agent community is some kind of two-year deal averaging $30 to $35 million a season with $40 to $45 million guaranteed. That would put Willis in position to go back to the table next offseason and negotiate a longer term deal that tacks on to the end of 2027 and extends his guaranteed money out into a three-year window through the 2028 season. There are varying opinions on the numbers and structure, not to mention the potential interest. Willis feels like the first big quarterback domino that has to fall in March to trigger a larger migration. If he were to land in Pittsburgh, that then puts Rodgers — if he still wants to play — onto the market for the Vikings or any other suitors. And once Willis is off the board, the teams that ultimately don’t have him as an option will then have to reassess.\n\nThere’s a sliding scale of a trade likelihood for all these players. Crosby’s situation with the Raiders, from what Yahoo Sports has been told by league sources familiar with their talks, is still at a standstill — but also not unrepairable. Part of the Raiders’ motivation is to see what Crosby’s trade market looks like and also where he is at with the franchise in a new phase of a rebuild. The market will likely be the driving force here. If there is a solid offer of draft picks on the table, a trade seems more likely than not.\n\nThe same goes for Brown and the Eagles, although it remains to be seen what general manager Howie Roseman could engineer to fill his No. 1 wide receiver spot if there is ultimately an attractive offer available for Brown. It’s highly unlikely the Eagles would move Brown and not have another player in the mix, so the combine’s wide receiver workouts and other available players at the position could factor.\n\nThe Murray and Tagovailoa process is going to depend on suitors and money. Right now there are zero indications of an appetite to take on either Tagovailoa or Murray’s remaining contract in a trade, let alone surrender any meaningful draft assets to make him a starter. That could change if the QB shuffling doesn’t break right for some teams and desperation enters the scenario. Lest anyone forget, there was a market (albeit diminishing) for Russell Wilson the past two offseasons. So there can certainly be a market for Tagovailoa or Murray if a situation gets bad enough.\n\nAs for the young players, Coleman seems likeliest to be traded, given the comments of Bills owner Terry Pegula that essentially branded him as not being the front office’s draft choice. Unfortunately for Buffalo, Coleman’s trade value will be nothing more than a late pick at this stage. Even with his youth.\n\nThomas, Richardson and McCarthy are not expected to be officially on the trade block, but all three could garner some interest and calls. Thomas seems less likely to be dealt with the Jaguars moving Travis Hunter primarily to cornerback. McCarthy won’t be dealt unless the Vikings are presented with a quarterback option that effectively renders any chance of him having a future as moot. And Richardson doesn’t have much of a market, and will have only one year left on his rookie deal once his fifth-year option is ultimately declined. That doesn’t leave much room to develop him for any interested franchise. But again, we don’t know how desperate the quarterback field gets.\n\nThat’s a lot of veteran questions and potential developments that will hang over the primary reason teams are in Indianapolis next week: To begin laying down the foundations of their draft boards for April’s selection process in Pittsburgh. While the veteran news and ramp up to free agency will cast a long shadow in Indianapolis, it won’t eliminate a litany of prospect-related storylines that will get rolling once workouts begin.\n\nHere’s a look at some of those that will be worthy of watching.\n\nWhile it’s not expected to be as top-heavy as the 2024 wide receiver class — which saw seven first-round picks at the position — the wideouts are considered a spot that is going to have depth and offer needy teams quality options potentially into the third round. The general consensus at this point is that four to five receivers could go in the first round. Most of the intrigue will be how the top of the class sorts itself between the trio of Ohio State’s Carnell Tate, Arizona State’s Jordyn Tyson and USC’s Makai Lemon.\n\n“I think you could see some [changes in that trio] between interviews, measurements and whatever work gets done,” one NFC talent evaluator said. “The medicals, too — definitely the medical for Tyson. … And it depends how you want to use them in your scheme. Lemon, some teams might not like the size but others might love the versatility and how he catches it. How fast will Tyson run and some of the speed and agility things with Tate will be important. They’re all good players, but there’s definitely some of the [Travis] Hunter, [Tetairoa] McMillan, [Emeka] Egbuka [conversations from 2025] because they’re not all similar players.”\n\nAs it stands, Tate appears to stand out among talent evaluators as the most “clean” player from the threesome, in terms of the total package of consistency, health, size and production. But there’s definitely curiosity about what his pure speed and agility will look like, especially alongside Lemon and Tyson. Some of those questions will be answered — if all three actually do full workouts at the combine, which isn’t guaranteed. Beyond that trio, there will definitely be some gravity toward the next tier of WRs in Washington’s Denzel Boston, Tennessee’s Chris Brazzell II and Notre Dame’s Malachi Fields, who all bring prototypical “X” receiver size to the table. The Bills will be an interesting team to watch with that group.\n\nFor only the second time in 13 years, we could end up seeing only one quarterback selected in the first round. With the Las Vegas Raiders expected to take Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza with the No. 1 pick, it’s also trending toward Mendoza passing on everything at the combine and opening the floor for the rest of the class. That will be a solid opportunity for multiple players, including Alabama’s Ty Simpson, Penn State’s Drew Allar, Miami’s Carson Beck, LSU’s Garrett Nussmeier and others.\n\nIt’s simply not a great class when it comes to star power (that will come in 2027), but there could be a bit of developmental depth with some strong showings.\n\nEven with the thin class, there is still plenty of quarterback need across the league — and that will point plenty of eyes in the direction of Simpson. He was a prospect with some solid draft heat near the midpoint of the college season, but red flags began to get raised as he got knocked around and turned the ball over later in the schedule and then suffered a rib injury that knocked him out of the College Football Playoff. Right now he’s likely to land in the late first to mid-second round range, somewhat similar to how teams were looking at Bo Nix in 2024, and Jaxson Dart and Tyler Shough last year. If Simpson can wow teams in interviews and put up a good workout, he can build momentum to move up the board and get a QB-needy team to expend a first-round pick on him. Already, you hear his name connected a lot to the Los Angeles Rams, who have the 13th and 29th overall picks.\n\nAs for the rest of the pack, it’s unclear what Allar will be able to do at the combine due to an ankle injury that ended his 2025 season. He’s the player with the size and easy arm strength, so he’ll draw in someone believing they can home his considerable talent into consistent results. Same goes for Beck, who also has size and arm, but also some leadership and love-for-the-game questions that teams want to pick at in interviews. Not to mention some bad turnovers in important spots, going all the way back to his time at Georgia. Then there’s Nussmeier, who some evaluators once believed could develop into a first-round pick, maybe even a solidly high one, before injuries derailed much of his 2025 college season. He’ll be another player who draws plenty of eyeballs.\n\nIt’s a loaded class with edge players, with an onslaught at that position expected to end up packing the first round. While there’s still a lot of work ahead, it wouldn’t be surprising to see as many as eight edge rushers come off the board in the first 32 picks. A lot of the attention will go to potential top-10 picks in Texas Tech’s David Bailey, Ohio State’s Arvell Reese and Miami’s Rueben Bain Jr. But there will be a battle to figure out the stack after that trio, with players like Auburn’s Keldric Faulk, Missouri’s Zion Young and Miami’s Akheem Mesidor battling it out. Young is a player to keep an eye on. He had a great week of practice at the Senior Bowl and ended up as the game’s defensive MVP, giving him a lot of buzz coming into the combine. But top to bottom it’s going to be great draft for teams that need edge players and defensive line talent in general.\n\n“It might be one of the deepest [edge] classes ever, especially through the top 50, 60 guys [in the entire draft],” an AFC general manager concluded. “There’s all types of skill sets and body types that fit different needs, but the talent in general just very, very good. There’s really not a Myles Garrett or Nick Bosa, but there’s a half dozen guys who could become just good, core second-contract players for teams.”\n\nBeyond the defensive line, there’s strength in the class of safeties and cornerbacks as well, with as many as a half dozen or more picks in the secondary likely to land in Round 1. And while safety isn’t traditionally a position that sees multiple first-round selections, this will almost certainly be one of those years, with Ohio State’s Caleb Downs, Toledo’s Emmanuel McNeil-Warren and Oregon’s Dillon Thieneman all having the profile to possibly land in the first half of the first round. That just doesn’t happen. Downs in particular will be very intriguing. His résumé is the kind that he’d be an easy top-five pick if he played at a more premium defensive position — and there were times that some evaluators believed he could even be worth that kind of juice in this draft. The overall strength of the defensive class at premium positions is likely to push him down the board, but it’s certainly not lost on front offices that so many of the NFL’s best defenses now feature a dynamic safety like Downs. That could cement Downs higher on teams boards by April.\n\nThe next running back after Notre Dame’s Jeremiyah Love is going to be an interesting development to watch. Overall, the class isn’t amazing and it’s going to be dinged a bit by the free-agent class being so strong. There’s no doubt that some teams want to see what Love’s backup for the Fighting Irish, Jadarian Price, does in the workouts. As much as game tape matters, Price could have transferred elsewhere for the 2025 college football season and doubled his touches while positioning himself to challenge Love as this year’s top running back. Now he comes into the draft with less wear and tear but also some curiosity about whether he can be a centerpiece starter and also catch the ball consistently out of the backfield. His workouts will matter, especially as it pertains to his receiving ability. If he can showcase that and put up the type of athletic numbers that some think he can, there will likely be more Alvin Kamara comparisons to follow. As of now, I’m not sure how that framing works without the receiving end of his game being more proven.\n\nOregon tight end Kenyon Sadiq is going to be interesting. Some evaluators like him as almost a hybrid running back/wide receiver if he fits into the right scheme. Others see him as a plus-level athlete whose “expected” 6-foot-2, 240-pound size is going to make him a bit of a tweener — and not in a good way — in the NFL. There’s curiosity about Sadiq’s true height and weight and what his workouts look like. There’s little doubt he has mismatch potential and maybe some considerable ceiling with the right coach and scheme, but some evaluators don’t see him as the kind of tight end who can fit in a lot of different places and be on the field at the rate of a multitude of TEs from last year’s draft. He can’t be compared realistically to the bigger bodied guys like Colston Loveland and Tyler Warren. And his overall consistency of college production wasn’t in the realm of Brock Bowers going into the 2024 draft. Who is the realistic comparable at the NFL level to Sadiq and what coach can draw that unique talent out of him?",

    "fullText": "No. 18 Saint Louis ended its 88-75 win over VCU on a power play Friday, thanks to a wild brawl shortly before time expired.\n\nThe fun began with Billikens guard Quentin Jones trying to dribble out the clock with his team up by double-digits. VCU's Nyk Lewis apparently wasn't happy about that, as he stole the ball, took a few steps and jacked up a half-court shot, which resulted in SLU star Robbie Avila — you might remember him from his time at Indiana State — bumping him out of bounds.\n\nAvila was called for a foul and also received a hard shove in the back from VCU forward Barry Evans, who then got shoved by Jones. Cue the benches the clearing, with 1.1 seconds left on the clock.\n\nBENCHES CLEAR IN SAINT LOUIS 🤯 VCU AND SLU BRAWL ON THE COURT pic.twitter.com/IRZHItxY7L\n\n— A10 Talk (@A10Talk) February 21, 2026\n\nThe courtside angle of the chaos:\n\nGo Billikens, great win. Barry Evans, what gives bro? pic.twitter.com/QpTqH9PD0h\n\n— Ross Chaifetz (@RossChaifetz) February 21, 2026\n\nAfter a lengthy delay, the officials ejected Evans and Jones with flagrant 2 fouls and also ejected all the players who left the bench once the dust-up started.\n\nThat left VCU with only four players. Lewis hit his three free throws, and the game ended.\n\nCuriously, it's the second straight year in which a VCU-Saint Louis game saw a brawl break out.\n\nBoth sides downplayed the incident after the game, with Avila saying \"That's not who we are\" and \"there's no ill intentions between anybody, just the emotions of the game.\"\n\nVCU head coach Phil Martelli Jr agreed:\n\n“I think there’s certainly a healthy intensity, as there should be at the top of the league, right? We've got a lot of respect for them. I think they have some respect for us, I assume,” Rams coach Phil Martelli Jr. said. “It’s two tough teams, two very competitive teams, two physical teams. Stuff like that, you wish it didn’t happen but, yeah, it’s an intense game. It’s an emotional game.”\n\nSaint Louis head coach Josh Schertz said the incident would \"get blown out of proportion,\" then provided his own recap of the incident:\n\n\"Guy stole the ball, Rob didn't take too kindly to it, fouled him, then that guy didn't take too kindly to Rob fouling him, two-hand shove in the back. And then our guy shoved that guy back and everybody just milled around and did what the general basketball fighting does, which is everybody's trying to get held back so they don't have to do anything.\"\n\nThe win keeps Saint Louis in the driver's seat in the Atlantic 10. Friday's game was between the No. 1 and No. 2. teams in the standings, and improved the Billikens' conference record to 13-1 while VCU sits at 12-3.",

We'll talk about one of those here in the column, along with Tama Tonga's win over Ilja Dragunov, Cody Rhodes' backstage confrontation with Sami Zayn, and much more!\n\nIf you're wondering why we're not discussing Oba Femi vs. Kit Wilson, or Tiffany Stratton vs. Alba Fyre (just to give two examples) it's because this show is three hours long and we can't cover everything — that's what our \"SmackDown\" results page is for. This column's subject material is reserved for matches and segments that moved us in some way, either positive or negative, as we continue to navigate the Road to WrestleMania. So without further ado, here are three things we hated and three things we loved about the 2/20/26 episode of \"WWE SmackDown!\"\n\nI have spent more time brainstorming creative ways to say \"I don't care\" than I have actually caring about the Wyatt Sicks and the MFTs' feud.\n\nHow long have these two factions been feuding? Weeks? Months? Maybe even years? Regardless, even as the MFTs attempted to turn a new leaf with Tama Tonga's match against Ilja Dragunov (and \"attempted\" is the operative word here; Solo Sikoa is still walking out with Uncle Howdy's iconic lamp), we still find ourselves in Wyatt Sicks/MFT purgatory. Aside from Sikoa stealing Howdy's lamp, nothing about this feud has changed people. Nothing about this feud has changed. The world of professional wrestling is supposed to be dynamic — the card is, famously, subject to change. How can a professional wrestling storyline remain so incredibly static?\n\nFirst off, I applaud Tonga getting a win over Dragunov. I don't particularly love the call, but I can realize that it's because of my own Dragunov biases. Dragunov will be fine after this loss; in all honesty, Tonga stands to gain more from a win over Dragunov, rather than the other way around. Tonga is the one in more desperate need of a momentum push, which is exactly what a win over Dragunov would give him...if WWE actually moved his character, or any of the MFTs characters', forward, past their relationship with the Wyatt Sicks. I know that Ilja tried to jump the MFTs all on his own after the match, but let's be real: that's not leading to a feud, not if the ending vignette with the Wyatt Sicks says anything about it. Tonga got a momentum-building win, but with no trajectory for him to move towards, what good is a boost?\n\nWhat good is a boost for any of these guys, MFT and Wyatt Sicks both, if they have nowhere to go? I don't care how cool you look walking to the ring with your arch nemesis' stolen lamp, or how creepy you are with a jumpscare at the end of your vignette. If you're doing the same thing, week in and week out, with no narrative progression other than a title change, I don't want to hear it. It sucks so bad, because the Wyatt Sicks and the MFTs are, on paper, good ideas. The Wyatt Sicks was the most anticipated stable in wrestling, and had the potential to be an incredible, living honor to the late Bray Wyat. The MFTs had the opportunity to be a dominant force on the blue brand, similar to Roman Reigns' original Bloodline. Instead, they're caught in this endless cycle of lukewarm conflict against each other. The narrative stagnation is choking them out like vines. Nothing changes. These men are wasted.\n\nTama Tonga beat Ilja Dragunov this week and although it came with a heap of help from the MFT, it continues what appears to be a genuine effort to build him up as a credible singles competitor. That may turn out to mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but for the wishcasting of this writer. However, with the spotlight came quite a uniquely fought bout between Tama and the \"Mad Dragon.\"\n\nNo one could ever rightfully call a Dragunov match clean, with his entire attraction being the untempered violence he dishes out and endures. And Tama has very clearly packed a lot more meat onto his frame, while still seeming to move like he did when he was smaller. So everything had a little more weight behind it, everything had a little more ugliness, and personally that only added to the quality of the match.\n\nThis wasn't an instant classic between two technical magicians, but it was a fight and interference aside it served both competitors very well. It does put a little bit of a dampener on things that Tama needed help to get the win. The argument on the other hand would surely be that Dragunov needed protecting. But at the end of the day Tama got the win and continues to roll through former United States Champions, having beaten Shinsuke Nakamura earlier this month. And that seems to put him in the trajectory for challenging for singles gold.\n\nI have long been a fan of Tama and while the creative behind MFT leaves much to be desired, it's just cool to see that he may be getting the opportunity to progress for himself. Guerillas of Destiny/Sons of Tonga had been a great act for well over a decade, mostly through Tama's doing, and one could argue he deserves his HBK moment. However that may come.\n\nIt's great to see Jade Cargill get some television time on this edition of \"SmackDown\", but if we're being honest, that television time wasn't really put to good use.\n\nCargill's promo felt incredibly basic, brief, and by the book. It was nothing more than Cargill essentially saying that she was ready for whoever her WrestleMania 42 opponent, whether it's Liv Morgan choosing to face her as the winner of the 2026 Women's Royal Rumble or the winner of the 2026 Women's Elimination Chamber Match. While it can be argued that this promo was used to set up some mystery intrigue as to who Cargill will face, I would say that's both a good thing and a bad thing. It does generate hype and excitement for the fans, but at the same time, it leaves a whole lot of questions and creates some confusion for me personally.\n\nCargill's staredown with Charlotte Flair on the entrance ramp did seem to be a bit of a tease and would indicate a potential meeting between them at WrestleMania 42, but at the same time, Flair lost her Triple Threat Elimination Chamber Qualifier to Kiana James which seems to rule out that possibility. It's always possible that Flair could turn on Bliss to cost her the match and maybe take over her place, but I'm not convinced that WWE would be willing to do something like that. Morgan has also been set up as another potential opponent for Cargill, but it seems more likely than not that she'll be picking Women's World Stephanie Vaquer given their recent heated confrontations on \"Raw\". WWE could also opt to have Tiffany Stratton win the 2026 Women's Elimination Chamber match to set up a WrestleMania rematch between Cargill, but that feels like a really boring and safe choice.\n\nWith so many potential opponents for Cargill and with so much uncertainty as to which route WWE will go for her WrestleMania 42 opponent, I can't help but get the feeling that perhaps WWE doesn't quite know which route they want to go down themselves. It feels so convoluted and murky as of this moment, although time will ultimately tell how things will play out.\n\nSo Kiana James getting the win over Charlotte Flair and Nia Jax, two well-established names, in a qualifying match for the Women's Elimination Chamber, gave a little of both in that respect. It is just a throw-away match on a Friday \"WWE SmackDown\" and it is hardly a sign that she is going to main event WrestleMania. But it is also a pin on Charlotte Flair, in a really inventive way too, that also saw her beat Nia Jax – a dominant former champion – to her first Elimination Chamber match.\n\nThat at the very least says the company has faith in James and gives her an opportunity to make a name for herself in the Chamber match on a PLE. And considering the depth – or lack thereof – of the current \"SmackDown\" women's division, that's certainly a good thing.\n\nThe match itself was pretty fun, with each participant offering something different; Flair was the quarterback veteran, Jax was the dominant force and anchor to the action, and James sneaked in where she could and that ultimately paid off. Flair had worked hard to get Jax in a position to beat her, only for James to leverage her submission into the winning pinfall.\n\nThat immediately casts James as a would-be dark horse in the upcoming Chamber match. She may not be the one getting the win and going to the \"Show of Shows,\" but there is a strong chance that she gets a pin or two on some of the faves in the match.\n\nWe're on the \"Road to WrestleMania,\", but it's mostly talk and no action. Superstars are mentioning it and commentary is pushing tickets, but the card is coming together at a snail's pace. One would think one of the matches they'd be building towards is a match for the men's tag titles. MFT only won them a few weeks ago, yet no one is challenging for them. In fact, none of the tag teams seem to even care about them. Instead, they are preoccupied by one half of a former tag team. (There's also one less tag team competing for the titles, but I digress.)\n\nWrestling storylines sometimes revolve around objects like a fan-made bracelet or a lantern. In the case of Johnny Gargano and Candice LeRae, it was a mask belonging to Axiom. Since losing possession of it, Gargano has become depressed and taken up planking (or maybe it's because he regrets his life choices after seeing his former tag partner winning a title on his first night in a rival company). He is often laid out across a storage trunk or the box containing Danhausen or Chris Jericho or EVIL or the Gobbedley Gooker. LeRae is fed up that no one will help her husband. Gargano is depressed and you're laughing? Fraxiom and Motor City Machine Guns are. In their defense, Gargano has been a jerk to all four men and it's understandable.\n\nThe men's tag team division on \"SmackDown\" has been a mess for a while and the \"Raw\" division barely qualifies as a division. WWE is wasting one of the greatest tag teams of their generation in MCMG. Fraxiom is a great tag team that should be in the title picture. The problem is no tag teams are in the title picture because no one cares. Street Profits are wrestling house shows when they should've never been off TV. As a fan of tag team wrestling, it's frustrating that there's no effort (but WWE has long stopped caring about tag team wrestling). Last year, the tag title match was left off the WrestleMania card and there was a TLC match the following \"SmackDown\" that proved they deserved a 'Mania match. It seems we're heading towards another year where the titles are left off one of the biggest PLE's of the year.\n\nWith how easily WWE moves on from storylines and its characters, something we've sadly seen for Sami Zayn before, I really liked his backstage segment with Cody Rhodes, keeping him hot and at the forefront of fans' minds, especially during the busy WrestleMania season. This short backstage segment made me believe (or at least have hope) that Zayn isn't going to get lost in the shuffle, and on a pretty average episode of \"SmackDown\" tonight, it's one thing I really liked.\n\nZayn has been locked in some kind of mini-feud/rivalry with newcomer Trick Williams, which I've mentioned I really like a lot, but that wasn't the highlight of his story tonight. Sure, Williams got in his face there for a second after a brief crash-out following his interaction with Rhodes, but his confrontation with the former Undisputed WWE Champion was the highlight of this. And, it was something that needed to be addressed after Rhodes pinned Zayn in the Elimination Chamber qualifier last week. But, as we all know, it easily could have been something WWE chose to just never address again.\n\nRhodes appeared to be attempting to cheer Zayn up backstage, but after Rhodes being the one to dash his Chamber dreams last week, I really loved that Zayn wasn't having it. He wasn't all, \"Aw, shucks, man, thanks,\" when Rhodes told him that he shouldn't be ashamed of himself. Zayn was quick to say that he knew that, and it was Rhodes who should be ashamed for stabbing him in the back. Zayn said everything always comes up roses for Rhodes, but for him? He's been trying to finish his story for 10 years, and Rhodes doesn't know what it's like to do the right thing.\n\nThat's when things really started getting heated, and Zayn still wasn't having any of it, and had his mini-crash out, slamming stuff around as Rhodes walked away. I didn't love how Zayn apologized to him after his words with Williams, but this was still one of the best things on the show tonight. I'm also not sure if I love Zayn possibly turning heel, but I don't really know if fans would let that work at this point.\n\nI liked that this was simple and that we didn't see Zayn again for the rest of the night. He's involved with himself and his feelings and plans for the moment, and didn't need to get involved with Williams' qualifying match for the Elimination Chamber, or in the main event where McIntyre cost Randy Orton the match, which brought out Rhodes. This was clean, simple, and effective, and I'm glad WWE doesn't appear to be dropping anything for Zayn, at the moment, at least.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "It’s only the second weekend of the season, but Arizona is in jeopardy of letting this one get away before it even starts.\n\nThe Wildcats were shut out 4-0 by UConn on Friday night at Hi Corbett Field. The loss dropped them to 0-6 and extended their losing streak to eight dating back to last June’s trip to the College World Series, which feels like a century ago. It’s the longest skid since 2014.\n\n“I think it’s just gotten to the point where there’s a lot of anxiety, whether it’s new guys or the guys who played a lot here, just trying to do too much,” UA coach Chip Hale said. “And they put so much pressure on themselves. You can almost tell when guys get hits, right? When they get so excited, it’s like we’re back in Omaha or something. It’s just a base hit in game three or four or five. And so I can tell by that that they just are releasing so much anxiety out of their body. So we just got to find a way to get them to relax.”\n\nArizona finished with three hits, singles by Andrew Cain and Mathis Meurant and a double by Nate Novitske. Only two of eight baserunners reached third and the team struck out another 10 times, upping the season total to 80 in six games.\n\n“We don’t look ready to hit when we’re taking some pitches,” Hale said. “We’re stuck. And that comes from anxiety. In life, anything you do, it’s hard to do, to be at your best when your body’s all knotted up.”\n\nThat frustration spilled over into the field, as Arizona was charged with three errors and made several other defensive miscues.\n\n“How that game ended 4-0 I have no idea, we made so many mistakes on defense that are not characteristic of this group,” Hale said. “Hitting is hard, it’s the hardest thing to do in sports. We can control what we do on defense.”\n\nThe defensive issues and continued hitting struggles overshadowed another solid pitching performance by most of the staff. Owen Kramkowski struck out six over four innings, allowing two runs (one earned), while five relievers combined for 11 strikeouts. That included eight punchouts by a trio of relievers making their UA debuts.\n\nLefty Maclain Roberts came on with the bases loaded and one out in the eighth and struck out both UConn batters, the first on a nasty slider and the second a fastball down and away. Roberts then struck out the side swinging in the eighth.\n\n“When you look at his numbers from the preseason, everybody pitches their way in or pitches their way out,” Hale said of Roberts, a native of New Zealand who pitched the last two years at Pima College. “He had not pitched his way in. You pitch like that, you’re gonna get yourself in another game.”\n\nWhile the anxiety and frustration is evident, Hale said the effort has still been there. Making sure that remains will be difficult until the wins come.\n\n“It’s tough for the kids,” he said. “I know they’re they want to win for the program, they want to win for the fans. They want to win for themselves. Coach Jerry Kendall was very succinct in what he used to tell us: ‘disappointed is okay, we just can’t let them get discouraged.’ They’re very close. the two words, but there’s a huge difference. When you get discouraged, it’s tough to bring them back, but disappointed is okay.”",

    "description": "Fairfield Union nearly blew a big lead against rival Bloom-Carroll but secured a dramatic 56-55 victory thanks to clutch free throws.",
    "fullText": "LANCASTER – What looked to be a blowout for the Fairfield Union boys’ basketball team turned into a nail-biter against rival Bloom-Carroll on Friday, Feb. 20.\n\nThe Falcons raced out to a 16-2 lead in the first five minutes of the game, and midway through the second quarter, held a 24-9 advantage. However, the Bulldogs weren’t about to go down without a fight. They showed a lot of grit and clawed back, cutting the lead to just two points with 17 seconds remaining.\n\nFairfield Union held off the hard-charging Bulldogs by making clutch free throws in the closing seconds to come away with a hard-fought 56-55 Mid-State League-Buckeye Division victory.\n\nThe Falcons were able to keep the Bulldogs just out of reach by making 13-of-16 free throws in the fourth quarter, including four straight in the final 17 seconds. Mason Ailes led the way by going 6-for-6 in the fourth quarter, and sophomore Asa Kline hit the clinching free throws with 13 seconds left.\n\n“Free throws are a big part of our practice, and we try to get at least 50 up during practice,” Ailes said. “We haven’t been the best at it this year, but we were able to come through when we had to. When you are up there in pressure situations, you just try to go through your routine, and we were able to knock them down when we had to.”\n\nMore: Fisher Catholic's Hadli Gillum is a sophomore basketball sensation\n\nFairfield Union coach John Helber said he knew the Bulldogs (12-10, 7-5) wouldn’t go away, forcing the Falcons (15-7, 9-3) to make their free throws in the end, but he had confidence in his guys when they toed the line.\n\n“I have a lot of confidence in our guys at the free throw line,” Helber said. “Asa and Mason hit the big ones. We practice free throws every day, and we do different things to make them like game situations in case it comes down to that at the end. We knew Bloom-Carroll would make a run. They have great shooters and run their offense well, but we hung in there and made the plays we needed to make. We needed to get this win tonight, and we needed to bounce back and get some confidence going into the tournament, and I think we did that tonight.”\n\nThe Falcons couldn’t have had a better start to the game, as five different players scored to build a big lead in the first quarter. They led 19-6 heading into the second quarter, but the Bulldogs stayed the course and finished the first half on a 10-2 run to cut the deficit to 28-19.\n\nThe Bulldogs kept the momentum going in the third quarter, cutting the margin to 34-31, but Drake DeFazio hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer to give Fairfield Union a 37-31 lead heading to the fourth quarter.\n\nBloom-Carroll kept chipping away, thanks to nine points from senior guard Caleb Hinkel. The Bulldogs were able to get it to a one-possession game when Hinkel scored on a three-point play, cutting the deficit to 45-42 with just over two minutes to play. However, the Falcons were able to keep them at arm's length by making seven consecutive free throws at one point.\n\nJayven Griffith had a steal, and Hinkel scored on another three-point play with 17 seconds left to cut it to 54-52 before Kline sealed it with his two free throws.\n\n“We didn’t like how we started the game, but credit to our guys,” Bloom-Carroll coach Andy Schmitz said. “Our guys want to keep playing, and it showed a lot about who we are. We stayed aggressive and stuck with it. We knew we couldn’t get it all back at once. It was going to be a grind all the way through, and our guys gave great effort and didn’t give up and kept fighting to the end. We just weren’t able to quite get over the hump because Fairfield Union kept making their free throws.”\n\nKeaton Webb led a balanced attack for the Falcons with 18 points and eight rebounds. Kline finished with 11 points, 12 rebounds, and three assists. Ailes also had 11 points, while Trevor Utzinger chipped in six points and five assists, and Dean Clark added six points.\n\nHinkel led the Bulldogs with 15 points, Griffith had 13, and Brady Petty chipped in nine points.\n\nTom Wilson is a sports reporter for the Lancaster Eagle-Gazette.

    "fullText": "Sometimes it’s not about having the ability to “buy another” after losing something valuable; it’s about the loss itself. LaMelo Ball can get his hands on another Hummer, but the one he crashed must have left him feeling devasted. Or perhaps not, if he thinks like DaBaby.\n\nThere were reports from earlier this week that suggested that Ball crashed his Hummer in the streets of Charlotte. Thankfully, he was unharmed. He got into another car — notably, a Lamborghini — and simply left the scene.\n\nBall had no time to dwell on that though, with NBA action resuming on Thursday following the All-Star break, and in the Charlotte Hornets’ game against the Cleveland Cavaliers, he got words of consolation from rapper DaBaby.\n\nA Charlotte native, DaBaby was sitting courtside. When Ball came close to him mid-game, he got the star guard’s attention and reminded him, “N **** crash cars every day, we ain’t worried about none of that!”*\n\nBall heard him, and laughed it off. Although for certain, he won’t be looking forward to crashing a car every day! DaBaby, however, went on to reveal in the video that, “I just crashed my Hellcat. N **** crash cars everyday.”*\n\nThe video involving the rapper was funny, but in actuality, it was a scary moment for Ball and those involved in the crash in downtown Charlotte. The lady driving the other car, like Ball, escaped without any major injuries which was a moment of relief for the Hornets baller.\n\nAfter the team’s loss to the Rockets on Thursday, Ball, who dropped 11 points and had somewhat of an off night, said, “I seen her get straight out of the car.”\n\nTalking about how he felt in the build-up to the game, Ball added, “I’m just alive and blessed. God is great.”\n\nFor now, there is no verdict on who was at fault, and it is also uncertain whether any legal action will be taken against Ball. He is not expected to miss time on the court, although he appears slightly shaken up.\n\nThe post “I Just Crashed My Hellcat”: LaMelo Ball Gets Courtside Consolation From DaBaby Over Crashing His Hummer appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "After getting eight full days off since their last game, the South Bay Lakers headed to Comerica Center in the Dallas-Ft. Worth Metroplex to take on the Texas Legends on Friday. They're looking to start stacking up wins in bunches as the push for the G League postseason nears.\n\nSouth Bay put up 37 points in the first quarter and was ahead 66-45 at halftime. The team never let up, as it led by as many as 26 points in the fourth quarter and ended up winning by a final score of 127-105. It was plus-10 in rebounds, plus-seven in fast-break points and shot 51.1% from the field while holding Texas to just 37.7% field-goal shooting.\n\nDrew Timme led the way for the Lakers with 25 points on 11-of-20 shooting, eight rebounds and four assists. Adou Thiero, a rookie forward who was taken in the second round of the 2025 NBA Draft, made all but one of his eight shot attempts and ended up with 19 points and seven rebounds. Four men off the bench — Malik Williams, Arthur Kaluma, Anton Watson and Augustas Marčiulionis — scored in double figures.\n\nBronny James played 27 minutes in this game and shot 5-of-14 from the field. He finished with 13 points, five rebounds, five assists, one steal and two blocks.\n\nThis win gave South Bay a 12-8 record, which puts it in fifth place in the Western Conference.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: South Bay Lakers recap: G League Lakers race past Legends",

    "description": "The Hawks and Patriots joined in a pregame moment of silence for those lost in Monday's mass shooting during a high school hockey game in Pawtucket.",
    "fullText": "WARWICK – Friday evening was an attempt for the state’s hockey community to move on.\n\nNormal? It feels a long way from however you might define that in 2026.\n\nBishop Hendricken used part of its practice time this week to discuss evacuation routes at Thayer Arena. Pilgrim asked its student section to wear orange instead of its usual black and white while promoting gun violence awareness.\n\nThe Hawks and Patriots shared the center circle as one for a pregame moment of silence. Bishop Hendricken’s eventual 2-1 victory in a thriller between Division I rivals started with a common purpose. Each player was touched in some way by the horrific Feb. 16 shooting in Pawtucket that left three dead and three critically wounded at Lynch Arena.\n\n“It’s tragic,” Pilgrim goalie Michael Bessette said. “Practice has been a little gloomy. But we tried to bring awareness and show everyone what hockey is really about.”\n\n“When it comes to Rhode Island, it’s like, ‘Wow, it’s kind of real,’” Bishop Hendricken defenseman Ethan Sykora said. “It feels like it could happen at any time.”\n\nSykora is a Coventry native. He counts multiple former youth teammates on that high school's current co-op roster with Johnston. Those fellow teenagers skated for their lives when gunfire erupted in the stands, barricaded into their own locker room by coach Joseph Stringfellow until law enforcement arrived to clear the scene.\n\n“Gun violence in general needs to end,” Sykora said. “There’s no place for it. Mental health, too – something was wrong. You need to go talk to someone.\n\n“I feel like that needs to be pushed out there a little more. That can prevent something like that from happening.”\n\nSykora added an orange strip of tape to the light blue already featured on the shaft. That’s meant to raise awareness for the Shoulder Check program, a mental health initiative backed by the NHL, ESPN and Madison Square Garden, among others. Multiple mass school shootings in America over the last three decades have been carried out by current or former students who were victims of bullying or marginalized by their peers in some way.\n\n“You have to reach out,” Sykora said. “There’s no reason to make yourself suffer. There are plenty of people in this world who are going to help you – me included.\n\n“I never shy away from anyone. I never want to exclude anyone.”\n\nBessette made 38 saves in a sharp performance for the Patriots, beaten only by some tic-tac-toe passing in front and a tipped shot from the point that left him no chance to react. What happened elsewhere this week, his own student section lining the glass, the growing buzz in the crowd as the third period went on – it all melted into the background once the puck dropped.\n\n“You lose track of everything,” Bessette said. “You’re so focused and dialed in. You’re just focused on the game and ready to play.”\n\nCullen Crain and Mason Crain set up Nick DiRaffaele at the left post to put the Hawks (16-2-0) in front midway through the first period. Tiernan Leahy netted the eventual winner at 1:25 of the third when he redirected a Tuckerman Camera drive between the circles. Paul Smith answered for Pilgrim (12-8-1) when he converted a turnover in the neutral zone to a breakaway goal barely a minute later.\n\n“We had a great crowd tonight,” Bessette said. “It’s always good going against Hendricken. We practice in the same rink.\n\n“It’s just fun. It's really fun.”\n\nBlackstone Valley’s co-op – North Providence, North Smithfield, Providence Country Day and St. Raphael – has canceled the remainder of its regular-season games. Its own road to true healing will be considerably more difficult after losing members of its extended family so senselessly. Bessette found some solace in a return to action and the resources he has available if needed.\n\n“There’s no shame in asking for help if you need it,” Bessette said. “If you ever have mental health problems you should always go to whoever you can.\n\n“Whether it’s a teacher, a therapist – whoever. Your mental health is the most important thing in your life.”\n\nFirst period – BH, Nick DiRaffaele (Mason Crain, Cullen Crain), 8:10. No penalties.\n\nSecond period – No scoring. Penalties – P 1-2, BH 1-2.\n\nThird period – BH, Tiernan Leahy (Tuckerman Camera, Karlton Lough), 1:25; P, Paul Smith (unassisted), 2:29. Penalties – P, 1-2.\n\nShots on goal – P, 6-7-10 – 23; BH, 16-12-12 – 40. Saves – Michael Bessette, P, 38; Zach Fontenault, BH, 22.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Providence Journal: Hendricken boys hockey beats Pilgrim 2-1 february 20 2026",

    "description": "The nine-time NFR bucking horse passed away in January, but his offspring are already carrying his name and his talent into the big shows.",
    "fullText": "When the talented Straight Jacket passed away in January 2026, the rodeo world lost more than a bucking horse. They lost a foundation sire, a proven champion, and a cornerstone of one of the sport’s most respected programs.\n\nThe 16 year old PRCA bucking horse from J Bar J Pro Rodeo suffered a broken leg and was treated at Washington State University, but he could not overcome the injury. After a storied career, J15 Straight Jacket was laid to rest on the ranch in Circle, Montana. Sparky and Marleen Dreesen mourned the loss of a horse that had become far more than just a number in the program.\n\nIn a social media post, the Dreesens shared, “He was heart, grit, and a partner in showcasing the very best of rodeo.”\n\nThat description fits just perfectly for the talented horse.\n\nStraight Jacket made nine trips to the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo. Five of those in bareback riding and four in saddle bronc. His distinctive bald face and classic bucking style made him instantly recognizable, and he was respected the moment he left the chute.\n\nBut what makes Straight Jacket’s story even more significant is what is happening now. His offspring are not just carrying on his name, they are winning with it at the highest level.\n\nAt the 2025 NFR, an impressive eight of Straight Jacket’s colts were selected to buck at the Thomas & Mack Center. Eight. That kind of representation at rodeo’s biggest stage is not luck or coincidence, it is the result of intentional breeding and bloodlines built to last.\n\nStraight Jacket was sired by Night Jacket, a legendary bucking horse inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in 2023 after seven consecutive bareback selections at the NFR from 2000 to 2007. Straight Jacket was one of 265 Night Jacket colts to have been selected to buck in Las Vegas. This is a staggering statistic that speaks to the strength of that line from the beginning. Out of Kattle Bells, he carried genetics that were proven before he ever stepped into the arena at all.\n\nOne of his standout offspring, Shady Jacket, has already made major noise. At the 2025 NFR, Shady Jacket helped saddle bronc rider Stetson Wright to an 89.75 point ride and a share of the Round 10 victory. Then on Feb. 7 at the Fort Worth Stock Show & Rodeo, Shady Jacket was half of Darcy Radel’s 91 point ride to split the final round win inside Dickies Arena.\n\nThat 91 point ride in Fort Worth was memorable. It was one of the top rides of the entire rodeo, and it came just weeks after Straight Jacket’s passing. Seeing his bloodline still dominating in major arenas made it clear that this legacy is not slowing down.\n\nAt the 2020 NFR that was held in Arlington, Texas Straight Jacket was placed in the TV pen (rounds 5 and 10) of the saddle bronc. He also had a daughter paced in the same pen for the bareback riding. The TV pen is reserved for the flashiest, best horses out there. Historically, these horses were chosen this way because only Round 10 was televised. Not only did Straight Jacket make that cut, but since then several of his songs and daughters have too.\n\nStraight Jacket had become a major part of J Bar J’s breeding program, just like his sire before him and because of amazing modern technology, his influence will continue for generations.\n\nThe stock contracting firm reported that they have collected hundreds of straws from Straight Jacket during his lifetime. According to Sparky Dreesen, the breeding approach moving forward will be intentional and selective.\n\n“We know the crosses that work, and we're probably not going to be trying any new crosses with him,” Dreesen said to the PRCA. “We'll see how that works a few years down the road.”\n\nJ Bar J plans to utilize intracytoplasmic sperm injection technology they say. It allows programs to preserve and strategically use elite genetics long after a horse is gone.\n\nThe goal is not just to replicate talent though, it is to build generations of bucking horses that carry the consistency, power and style that J Bar J has been known for. Maybe they will carry Straight Jacket’s personality, too.\n\nHe gave everything to the sport of rodeo and left a mark that goes far beyond the arena, living on in the memories of those who were lucky enough to climb into the chute on top of him.\n\nNow, his offspring is doing it for him.\n\nFrom Las Vegas to Fort Worth and beyond, the Straight Jacket name is still being called, and judging by what we have already seen, it will be for years to come.",

    "fullText": "If anyone was wondering whether Alabama softball is for real this season, Friday night delivered a loud, undeniable answer.\n\nBehind a lights-out performance from freshman pitcher Vic Moten and an explosive offensive surge, No. 9 Alabama shut out No. 7 Florida State 8-0 in one of the biggest early-season matchups in the country.\n\nRound One goes to the Crimson Tide🥊#Team30 #RollTide | @TMobile pic.twitter.com/8n2zMQVQGQ\n\n— Alabama Softball (@AlabamaSB) February 21, 2026\n\nIn a hostile environment and against a top-10 opponent, the Crimson Tide didn’t just win, they controlled the game from start to finish.\n\nMoten was the story from the circle. The freshman right-hander pitched with the poise of a seasoned veteran, silencing a dangerous Seminole lineup and never allowing Florida State to build any momentum. She attacked hitters, trusted her defense, and showed zero fear on a big stage. Performances like this are how young stars announce themselves nationally, and Moten did exactly that.\n\nFor three innings, the game felt like a heavyweight fight, with both teams trading scoreless frames.\n\nThen Alabama’s bats erupted in the fourth inning, and the entire tone of the game shifted instantly.\n\nBrooke Wells got things started with a towering solo home run that broke the tension and put the Tide on the board. Alexis Pupillo followed with a blast of her own, and before Florida State could regroup, freshman slugger Ana Roman crushed a two-run shot to cap a stunning three-homer inning. Just like that, Alabama had seized a 4-0 lead and complete control.\n\nThe freshman stays hot at the plate🔥\n\n📺ACCNX streaming | https://t.co/6bqnpNGavv #Team30 #RollTide pic.twitter.com/WVY0H3rwqn\n\n— Alabama Softball (@AlabamaSB) February 20, 2026\n\nThe Tide poured it on late, adding four more runs in the seventh inning with clutch hitting up and down the lineup. Pupillo delivered again with an RBI single, Jena Young added another run-scoring hit, and Kristen White provided the knockout blow with a two-run single that stretched the lead to eight.\n\nAlabama finished with 11 hits, showcasing both power and timely situational hitting. Wells led the charge with a three-hit night, while Pupillo and Roman continued to prove that this lineup has dangerous production from top to bottom.\n\nMost impressive of all was how complete the performance was.\n\nAgainst a top-10 opponent ON THE ROAD, no less.\n\nNow sitting at 11-0, this Alabama team isn’t just winning, they’re sending a message.\n\nThe Tide looks deeper, tougher, and more confident than they have in years, and they’re doing it with a mix of experienced leaders and fearless freshmen who aren’t waiting their turn.\n\nIf this game was any indication, Alabama softball isn’t just off to a hot start.\n\nThey’re building something special.",

    "fullText": "No. 7 BYU made light work of Fort Valley State Friday night in Provo, picking up its eighth straight sweep and imposing its will on the Wildcats in a very one-sided match.\n\nThe Cougars heated up as the contest wore on, taking it by set scores of 25-18, 25-16 and 25-14.\n\n“Hitting-wise, we made very few errors,” BYU senior setter Tyler Herget said after tallying 35 assists on a night when his team tallied a torrid .468 hitting percentage.\n\n“That’s something that we’ve been trying to work on, … keeping the ball in play against any team. That gives us a shot at winning any point, and so I think we did a very good job there.”\n\nThe match marked the first time the two schools had faced each other, as Fort Valley State played its inaugural season just four years ago.\n\nBYU looked like the more experienced team Friday evening, wearing the Wildcats down and staying in control for most of the match.\n\nThe Cougars were led by two of their usual workhorses, senior outside hitter Trent Moser and sophomore outside hitter Connor Oldani, who each finished with 12 kills and a pair of blocks.\n\nAll in all, it was a good team effort from BYU, which finished with 10 different players logging at least one kill.\n\nIt took the Cougars a few moments in the initial set before they began to separate themselves from the Wildcats, but the Provo school really took control when junior opposite hitter Teilon-Jonathan Tufuga led the team to four straight points and a 12-9 lead.\n\nThe Long Beach native first earned a sideout kill before putting on a show with some high-powered serving that led to a BYU overpass kill followed by two consecutive aces.\n\nBehind Tufuga’s serving and Moser’s seven kills, the Cougars proved to be too much for their visitors, ultimately expanding on their lead by the end of the set to win comfortably.\n\n“I think (Tufuga) really kind of set the standard for us from the service line,” BYU coach Shawn Olmstead said on a night when his team had seven aces from five different players.\n\n“He’s one of the better servers in the country right now statistically, and so he showed that again tonight. That got us that separation. … I was proud of (Tufuga) to put that pressure on them.”\n\nBYU ramped up the pressure in the second set, winning it in dominant fashion. The Cougars ultimately won the set by nine, but it could have been by more had a pair of Fort Valley State points not brought the Wildcats within 10 as the set neared its end.\n\nThe Cougars never trailed in the set, their advantage growing as it wore on before settling on the nine-point victory.\n\nThings only got more lopsided in BYU’s favor in the final set, the hosts going on three different 3-0 runs, essentially locking up the match long before the final whistle.\n\nThe Cougars’ victory pushes their win streak to eight matches, their last loss coming on January 24.\n\n“(We) did what we … wanted … to do (tonight),“ Olmstead said. “We were able to get… other guys in. That was the best part. I didn’t think we let down at all. … I think we need that physicality off the bench as we go down the stretch, and especially (in) March and April, it gets real nasty.”\n\nRight now, in February, BYU is looking pretty and will try to extend its win streak to nine when the Cougars and the Wildcats meet again Saturday evening at the Smith Fieldhouse at 7 p.m.",

They’re a team in tremendous form.\n\n“We all know how difficult a trip to El Sadar is for Real Madrid. I only won one of my trips there as a player.\n\n“We’re very aware of the tough battle ahead, of the opponent’s level, and of the excellent work of their coach. We’re going to prepare in the best possible way, knowing that the three points would be extremely important.”\n\nThe 43-year-old praised the development he has seen from his side since taking charge in January, explaining that “the team has grown a lot in recent weeks.\n\n“We are aware of the demands of this club and we want to keep working. The league season is very long but for me, it has barely even begun.\n\n“We have a very difficult away match, as they all are, and our objective now isn’t to relax because to win every match, you have to be at 100%,” he said.\n\nArbeloa also issued updates on Kylian Mbappé’s fitness, revealing that the Frenchman is “feeling better every day” after returning from a knee injury.\n\nThe former PSG forward featured in Real Madrid’s Champions League meeting with Benfica, and Arbeloa confirmed that “his knee is much better. It’s not completely gone away, but he is feeling better every day.”\n\nOsasuna v Real Madrid kicks off at Estadio El Sadar at 17:30 GMT on Saturday 21 February, with los Blancos able to move five points clear of Barcelona with a win.",

    "fullText": "WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) — Trey Kaufman-Renn scored 20 points and Braden Smith added 15 points and eight assists Friday night, helping No. 7 Purdue produce a historic rout over rival Indiana 93-64 to earn a split in this season’s series.\n\nThe Boilermakers emphatically ended their two-game losing streak against the Hoosiers by producing their highest point total in the series since scoring 94 points in 1998. It also was their largest victory margin in the series since a 44-point shellacking in 1969.\n\nFletcher Loyer and Omer Mayer each scored 18 points, with Loyer going 5 of 5 from the field, making four of his 3-pointers and all four free throws in what could be the Indiana finale for Purdue’s three senior starters — Kaufman-Renn, Smith and Loyer. The victory came three days after Purdue (22-5, 12-4 Big Ten) lost at home to top-ranked Michigan.\n\nLamar Wilkerson scored 18 of his 20 points in the second half to lead Indiana (17-10, 9-7), which lost its second straight to a top-10 team. Tayton Conerway had 12 points and seven assists, while Tucker DeVries added 11 points on a night Indiana’s offense never got in sync and whose post players struggled against the Boilermakers size, all while battling foul trouble.\n\nPurdue took control quickly, using an 11-4 spurt to take a commanding 26-14 lead. The Boilermakers extended the margin to 46-29 when Nick Dorn’s half-closing 3-ponter was erased after a replay review determined the shot came after time expired.\n\nKaufman-Renn and Loyer opened the second half with Purdue’s first three baskets to make it 54-32 with 17:41 to go, and the Hoosiers never recovered as the Boilermakers led wire to wire.\n\nIndiana: Begins its final homestand Tuesday against Northwestern.\n\nPurdue: Closes out a three-game homestand against No. 15 Michigan State on Thursday.",

    "fullText": "Friday wasn’t the best of evenings for the Minnesota and St. Thomas women’s hockey teams. Both were upended in WCHA play and now head into Saturday looking to gain series splits.\n\nThe Gophers battled back from a 2-1 deficit midway through the third period to force overtime at Minnesota-Duluth.\n\nUnfortunately, Minnesota’s rally only delayed the result as the Bulldogs prevailed 3-2 in the extra session.\n\nTova Henderson’s unassisted tally at 1:41 of OT iced the result and handed the Gophers a fourth consecutive defeat.\n\nMinnesota took the early lead as Madison Kaiser’s goal at 16:33 of the first period gave the visitors a 1-0 edge at Amsoil Arena on the shore of Lake Superior.\n\nThe advantage didn’t last long. UMD evened the count at 1-1 with a strike at 10:21. The hosts staked their claim to the game at 12:36 of the middle frame on a goal from Maddie Burr.\n\nDuluth’s 2-1 lead carried well into the third period before Ava Lindsay breathed new life into the Gophers at 9:30 of the stanza to send the game into overtime knotted at 2-2.\n\nWith the prospect of a shootout ticking ever closer, Henderson closed the door on Minnesota’s comeback. Bulldogs goalie Eve Gascon made 31 saves as her Gophers counterpart, Hannah Clark, made 29 stops. The loss dropped Minnesota to 24-8-1 overall and 18-8-1 in conference play.\n\nThe Bulldogs, as locked into fourth place in the WCHA standings as the Gophers are cemented to third place, improved to 18-12-3 overall and 14-10-3 in the circuit with one game remaining in the regular season.\n\nMinnesota and UMD will take the ice for that final pre-playoff contest at 2 p.m. Saturday inside Duluth’s lakeside arena. The game is scheduled to be televised on BTN+.\n\nAn exciting first period was followed by two more that didn’t go the Tommies’ way at the Lee & Penny Anderson Arena in a 5-2 loss.\n\nThe opening frame set up well for a big day in St. Paul. St. Thomas gave up the opening goal, but followed with two of their own in scintillating fashion to take a 2-1 lead into the first intermission.\n\nAfter the Mavericks drew first blood at 6:56, Rylee Bartz struck back for the Tommies just 24 seconds later to make the score 1-1. Then, just as fans began to head to get concessions, Ella Boerger had them standing up for a different reason as she scored with just four ticks left on the clock.\n\nMinnesota State got down to business in the second period, scoring the lone tally of the frame at 15:26 to draw even at 2-2.\n\nThat’s how the score remained until 16:09 of the third, when the visitors took their second lead of the game at 3-2. Unlike their brief first-period edge, this one proved to be permanent.\n\nThe Mavericks added a power play goal at 12:25 and a final tally with 2:15 remaining to skate away with the three-goal win.\n\nSt. Thomas goaltender Julia Minotti made 27 saves in the game, while MSU netminder Hailey Hansen saved 23 of 25 attempts.\n\nThe loss ended any Tommies hopes of leapfrogging the Mavericks in the WCHA regular-season standings. MSU (14-17-2 overall, 8-17-2 WCHA, 27 points) took a four-point edge on St. Thomas (12-20-1, 7-19-1, 23 points) in the conference with the win and just one game left to go before the playoffs.\n\nThe two teams go at it one more time at 2 p.m. Saturday inside Anderson Arena.\n\nCollege hockey: Tommies men tumble late vs. Vikings\n\nMen’s basketball: Gophers forward Jaylen Crocker-Johnson out indefinitely\n\nGophers, Badgers and Cyclones in hot pursuit of Maple Grove’s Babou Ann\n\nFootball: Gophers add productive Mississippi tailback Greg Hargrow to 2027 class\n\nWomen’s basketball: Gophers find aim, run away from No. 10 Ohio State",

    "fullText": "It took about a half for things to get rolling consistently, but the Sioux Falls Washington girls basketball team was able to get out in transition and run past Sioux Falls Roosevelt 69-43 on Friday, Feb. 20.\n\nThe Rough Riders were intent on getting the ball inside to 6-foot-3 sophomore Kalli Harris, which slowed the game down considerably. Roosevelt was able to hang around in the first half as Washington's half-court offense struggled to get going, but the Warriors still led 34-23 at the break.\n\n\"You've got to give Roosevelt credit,\" Washington head coach Jamie Parish said. \"The first thing that they did was kept going inside with the basketball, and that brought all of our kids down to protect the rim. Then it's a longer run when you have to get down and play physical.\"\n\nThe Warriors know they're at their best when they're out in transition and spent halftime trying to get to that more often.\n\nDana Harpe with a rebound off a Roosevelt miss and passes it to Josie Biteler for two. Washington leads 46-26 with 3:58 left in the third. Warriors have been cruising since they started to push the pace more. @ArgusSports pic.twitter.com/Oc2f29mvYa\n\n— Paul Cifonelli (@PCifonelli) February 21, 2026\n\n\"When we went in there, we knew we could play better and we knew we could get good shots easily, but we wanted to get the best shots by swinging it, moving it, giving it multiple touches,\" senior guard Dana Harpe said.\n\nParish knew it wouldn't be easy against a gritty Roosevelt team that played hard, and stressed to his girls that they needed to run the floor wide and run their lanes to get the ball up the floor quicker.\n\n\"We were told they weren't going to roll over and die, so just had to do our part and keep playing hard and keep playing as a team,\" senior guard Rylan Kennett said.\n\nWashington got out and ran immediately in the second half, starting the third with a 12-3 run to blow the game wide open.\n\n\"We're a team that thrives in transition,\" Harpe said. \"We're a really long team. We'll get up the court in five seconds. I feel like that translates on defense. If we get a good defensive possession we're going out in our outlets, and I feel like that's working well for us.\"\n\nThe Warriors got a lot of their fast-break chances from their defense, whether it was on steals or long rebounds. Parish wanted his girls to force more 3-pointers to get longer rebounds, which came with Roosevelt sophomore Henlee Loof making a few. Despite that, Washington stuck in its aggressive 2-3 zone that has led it to a 14-3 record this year.\n\n\"We tried to go a little bit of man and they got a couple baskets out of it,\" Parrish said. \"We're more comfortable in our zone. It's the thing that we practice, it's the thing that we stick to. We do give our kids a little bit of freedom in that zone to chase a kid. Our zone can change shapes and do some things.\"\n\nGood ball movement leads to a Rylan Kennett bucket. Washington up 27-15 with 5:35 left before halftime @ArgusSports pic.twitter.com/qc2GZV9M2T\n\n— Paul Cifonelli (@PCifonelli) February 20, 2026\n\nWashington now has two consecutive wins after back-to-back losses at home against Brandon Valley and at O'Gorman. The Warriors are looking to play like they did in the second half the rest of the regular season and into the postseason.\n\n\"We need to play to our standard every game no matter who we play because that's the only way we'll get better,\" Kennett said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sioux Falls Argus Leader: Washington girls basketball uses transition to race past Roosevelt",

They blew a 15-point lead in the second half, but Doncic scored 12 points in the fourth quarter as the Lakers split the four-game season series with their crosstown rivals.\n\nKawhi Leonard scored 31 points before missing the final 5:10 with an apparent ankle injury for the Clippers (27-29), who fell just short of getting back to .500 in incredible fashion after their 6-21 start to the season.\n\nBennedict Mathurin had 26 points and seven rebounds in his second straight outstanding game for his new team before fouling out with 1:49 to play.

They responded with a prolific offensive performance, even while James managed just two points in the second half.\n\nIn Doncic’s return from a four-game absence followed by a five-minute All-Star Game appearance due to a mildly strained hamstring, the Slovenian superstar scored 17 points with four 3-pointers in a dynamic first quarter for the Lakers, who made 16 of 17 shots in one stretch.\n\nLeonard, who had just one bucket in the first, answered with a 19-point second.\n\nThe Clippers' John Collins was helped off the court with 18 seconds left in the first half after he bloodied his face on a hard landing while trying to catch a long pass at the rim.\n\nClippers: Host Orlando on Sunday.",

    "description": "Games against Fulham haven’t always been thrilling, but one clash in April 2006 was filled with oddities!",
    "fullText": "The 2005/2006 season is one most Sunderland fans won’t want to remember too much of, given our total of just fifteen points and three wins.\n\nThe game was a chance to end a dire run of form — particularly at home. Back then, we’d see crowds of about 30,000 a week and go months without winning at the Stadium of Light — which had become a miserable sporting venue.\n\nThis was one of four home games I went to this season, and as a nine-year-old, this was probably for the best.\n\nHeavy rain on this particular Saturday afternoon eventually turned to snow, and by the time kick off came, the stadium was experiencing blizzard conditions. Yet just hours before, it was sunny, before the weather turned quicker than most of our defenders that season — which, in fairness, wasn’t that fast.\n\nDuring the build up to the match, my dad and I went to watch the players warm up. The snow was falling and starting to lie on the pitch with around an hour to go until kick off. Standing to the left of the goal at the North Stand, we spent about fifteen minutes watching our goalkeepers warm up.\n\nEach bounce of the ball and sprawling dive was met with the squelch of cold mud. It felt like it should be the middle of winter, yet the season was only a month away from ending!\n\nI was an aspiring goalkeeper at the time, so watching this warm-up was an education despite the dire weather.\n\nAs the warm-ups ended, Kelvin Davis must’ve spotted me watching on intently, as he unzipped his jacket and handed it over to me. I was delighted at the time — as was my dad — but then we were stuck with a waterproof jacket dripping with mud for what we thought would be a full game of football.\n\nKick off came, and I remember certain players looking like they were running through a swamp.\n\nIn hindsight, it’s a surprise referee Mike Riley was able to get the game underway at all, but they gave it a go for about twenty minutes and after three consultations with Sunderland caretaker boss Kevin Ball and Fulham manager Chris Coleman, he finally called it.\n\nSo many aspects of this game had “typical Sunderland” written all over it — firstly the fact that we still managed to concede during the period of the game that actually happened, and then that one player busted his nose open and was subbed off after colliding with his own player (Rory Delap walloping George McCartney).\n\nWe didn’t go down on that snowy day in April due to Birmingham’s failure to win, but the abandoned game only delayed the inevitable. It was a weird game from start to early finish, and Ball reported not being able to see across the other side of the pitch through the ice and snow showers.\n\nAs for Davis’ jacket? It’s still around at my family home, as far as I know. And yes, obviously, it’s been washed — although that’s surely knocked a few thousand pounds off the value I could’ve fetched for it on eBay? We may never know.\n\nTomorrow’s match will probably be very different, but it would be by simply being completed, but we’ll always have that bizarre afternoon in April 2006.",

    "fullText": "Savinho has missed the last 13 games for Manchester City. The Brazilian international was injured during Manchester City’s nil-all draw with Sunderland at the Stadium of Light at the beginning of January. Pep Guardiola has now revealed that Savinho is nearing a return to the pitch, which is good news for his team. Also, the Manchester City manager revealed that he has high hopes for Savinho as a player. Savinho is a player who can dazzle and frustrate in the same passage of play. But as Pep Guardiola said after his team’s win over Salford City, if the Brazilian international can put it all together, he could become a devastating weapon for his team.\n\nSpeaking after Manchester City’s 2-nil win over Salford City in their FA Cup fourth-round tie at the Etihad Stadium, Pep Guardiola revealed that Savinho could have played a few minutes against the League Two side. The Manchester City manager also revealed that if Savinho can put it all together with his end product, he will become a valuable weapon for his team. Speaking on Savinho’s injury situation, and the Brazilian international’s obvious potential, Pep Guardiola said: “He’s been out for six weeks. He could [have played] a few minutes, but we didn’t want to take risks. Training two days ago was wow, so good. He’s close. Now we have a long week and players coming back.”\n\n“Already Savinho, when he will learn to make the finished product he will be an unbelievable winger on both sides.”\n\nPep Guardiola’s assessment of Savinho is on the money. The Brazilian winger has the potential to become a key player for Manchester City. What has plagued Savinho since he arrived at City from Troyes is his end product. Savinho’s finishing is unreliable, and he squanders too many chances. His delivery and decision-making in the final third also remain inconsistent. None of these revelations are groundbreaking; they have been known for some time now. It is up to Savinho to rectify these areas of his game to take the next step as a player. He simply has to get an opportunity to become a consistent player for Manchester City.\n\nThere is strong competition now amongst the City sqaud for roles on either wing. Antoine Semenyo, Jeremy Doku, Rayan Cherki and Phil Foden all stand in Savinho’s way. You could throw Omar Marmoush into that mix as well. To make good on Pep Guardiola’s assessment, Savinho has to improve his end product. He has no other choice. Modern squads are built on options, and Guardiola has plenty available in wide areas. Supporters see a similar idea in games too, where players can buy V Bucks to open up more choices and customise their experience before jumping back into action. For Savinho, the challenge is simple — take the next step and make himself the first option when it matters most.\n\nIt is good news for Manchester City to have Savinho back from injury. His return gives Pep Guardiola another attacking option to utilize. Pep Guardiola has also explained what Savinho needs to do to grow as a player. It is now up to him to take the next step and not be squeezed out of Pep Guardiola’s squad.",

    "description": "After a promising if brief cameo against Oxford, could the Ivorian play a bigger part during our upcoming games?",
    "fullText": "Obviously it’s going to be very different when he’s trying to go off on mazy runs against fit, experienced Premier League defenders and not tiring low-end Championship players, but it was good to see him come on and be positive.\n\nI wouldn’t want to place too much pressure on the lad this season as the likelihood is that we’ll barely see him much, but when he does get opportunities, it’ll be during late cameos like that where he can be most effective in short bursts.\n\nWhat excites me about Ta Bi — and pretty much everyone else we sign, for that matter — is that because he’s young and moldable, if he’s any good, his rate of improvement will be rapid.\n\nOur coaching is brilliant and we’ve fostered an environment that allows young players to flourish, so I really don’t see how Jocelin doesn’t fit in here if he’s prepared to put the work in. The talent is there — which is what got him this move in the first place, as weren’t signing a finished product.\n\nNow, it’s down to him and his coaches to see how much he can blossom. I’m pretty excited, but won’t be getting too carried away just yet — it’s a huge jump from the Israeli top division to the Premier League, so let’s give him time.\n\nYes, he wasn’t on for long and he was up against lesser opposition, but Ta Bi appears to be an exciting prospect.\n\nHe was direct and progressive with the ball — clearly eager to show us fans what he can do, and his feet were quick as he swerved his way in and around the Oxford defenders.\n\nHe’s still rough around the edges, but the talent seems to be there. Whether or not he’s able to perform at Premier League level is yet to be seen, but after a good showing on Sunday, maybe we’ll see him coming off the bench in the coming league games.\n\nI love this type of player — a quick, skilled right winger with a good left foot who gets the fan on their feet. I’m sure he can sharpen his skills under the wing of Bertrand Traoré, and maybe even live up to the iconic Patrick Roberts, whom he follows in the footsteps of.",

    "description": "Poyet’s passionate plea to the fans sadly wasn’t enough to inspire a home victory against West Bromwich Albion",
    "fullText": "Only days after Gus Poyet’s open letter to the fans, his Sunderland team drew their thirteenth game of the season with a familiar 0-0 scoreline.\n\nThe Uruguayan felt compelled to write after some horrid results at home cranked up the pressure and left the team languishing just above the drop zone.\n\nIn the letter, Poyet asked fans to stay patient and positive in the midst of a bad run and accepted that criticism laid at his door.\n\nSo I invite all of you to stay positive, to be strong, closer to each other and keep believing in what we started together last year, working harder to make it better this season.\n\nTo finish I would like to clarify once more: the responsibility of the results of our team is down to me. I always said it and I will always accept my responsibility.\n\nSunderland struggled throughout the season and in truth, if you were a season ticket holder at the Stadium of Light, you’d certainly be wondering if you were getting “bang for your buck”, given that the team had only scored twelve goals at home by this stage of the season.\n\nIt was hoped that the signing of Jermain Defoe would make a difference and whilst he’d already picked up a couple of goals, the team still looked bereft and devoid of ideas in front of goal.\n\nA 0-2 defeat at home to QPR — then near the bottom of the table — was another nail in the coffin of Poyet’s already fragile tenure at the club, and it was in the aftermath to this defeat that he wrote the aforementioned letter.\n\nDays later, the Lads faced Tony Pulis’ revitalised West Bromwich Albion at the Stadium of Light and after the unexpected defeat to QPR, victory was certainly required here to alleviate some of the pressure on the team.\n\nWithout much difficulty, the away side absorbed our best attacking efforts and according to the match reports, our best attacks came from corners in the second half.\n\nSunderland’s best chances came from corners.\n\nSantiago Vergini headed wide a Larsson delivery amid more pushing and shoving in the penalty area, while substitute Connor Wickham turned Johnson’s ball straight at Foster.\n\nWith a trip to Old Trafford on the cards, this was a terrible week for Poyet and the team as the Lads only picked up one point from a potential six. Despite this, the manager attempted to take the positives out of the result and spoke about them after the game.\n\nThe performance was higher in commitment. Going for it, it was spot on. We needed a break. We needed a lucky goal or the right decision from somewhere. In England, you say it wasn’t to be and it was that kind of day.\n\nIt’s difficult for me. Tony has improved his team, he is one of the best and they are difficult to beat. I think we did enough to get a break today. It was important to get back to basics and we just needed that goal to be a perfect day.\n\nWe can take positives. We were higher up the pitch, we crossed I don’t know how many times. It wasn’t to be. You need to play this way. You need to anticipate the second ball. We will see.\n\nIt was a clear sign of a manager who potentially knew his days were numbered.\n\nSunderland’s style of play had become so sterile and ineffective that they were quite simply too easy to play against and with the drop zone looming, something had to change sooner rather than later.",

    "fullText": "UEFA are investigating explosive allegations levied against Benfica winger Gianluca Prestianni that he used a racial slur towards Real Madrid ace Vinicius Junior during their Champions League clash.\n\nAccording to ESPN, Prestianni admitted to using an anti-gay slur towards Vinicius rather than a racist insult.\n\nThe incident occurred in the second half at the Estadio da Luz on Tuesday night, shortly after Vinicius fired home the only goal of the game for Real Madrid.\n\nVinicius reacted angrily to comments from Prestianni, who had covered his face with his shirt. The Brazilian forward alerted the referee, prompting a 10-minute stoppage.\n\nThe Real Madrid forward initially accused the 20-year-old Argentine of racist abuse.\n\nHowever, sources say Prestianni has since told UEFA investigators he used a homophobic slur in Spanish, not the word mono, meaning monkey.\n\nThe explanation was reportedly relayed to Madrid midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni immediately after the game.\n\nReal Madrid have submitted what they describe as a full dossier of evidence to UEFA.\n\nForward Kylian Mbappe stated he heard racist abuse directed at his teammate on five separate occasions during the match, adding that some Benfica players were also aware of the comments.\n\nMbappe urged for serious punishment, and so too did head coach Alvaro Arbeloa, who wants UEFA to make the case a turning point in football’s battle against discrimination.\n\nUnder Article 14 of UEFA’s disciplinary regulations, sanctions for racist or homophobic abuse are identical, carrying a minimum 10-match suspension or equivalent ban.\n\nWhether racist or homophobic, the intent from Pretianni is the same. It is to demean, to dehumanise, to wound.\n\nSwapping one vile slur for another is not mitigation. It is not clarification. It is a confession.\n\nSo he’s not racist? Just homophobic? That’s hardly a defence. It paints the same ugly picture of a young professional who thinks hatred is acceptable, heat-of-the-moment behaviour.\n\nAt the elite level, ignorance is no shield. Football has moved on. Anyone who hasn’t shouldn’t be anywhere near it.",

    "description": "“I have confidence in this team’s ability to put a marker down against Fulham and go again”, writes John Wilson.",
    "fullText": "At the start of this season, it seemed as though every game was informative of the direction we were going in and that every game told us something about the squad and the team.\n\nHow would we compete with West Ham in our opening fixture? How would we bounce back after our first away defeat against Burnley? For me, it was following the home draw with Arsenal that I stopped asking about how we’d cope.\n\nThat performance told me all I needed to know: that when this Sunderland team puts their mind to a task; when there’s a collective desire to get a result, they can achieve it. So that took us to early November, when I started to relax and think we weren’t going to be in any relegation scrap, and to try and enjoy each match and the season as a whole.\n\nWhen there were blips and when the collective eye wasn’t on the ball (the away games against Fulham, Brentford and West Ham) we always bounced back with a win or at least a solid performance. Our home form has been excellent, attracting plaudits from every angle, and it wasn’t until the Premier League title holders came to the Stadium of Light earlier this month that our undefeated home record was lost.\n\nIndeed, our general form has been so good that there are many fans and football commentators who’ve mentioned Sunderland as contenders for a European spot. Yet, in the eyes of Régis Le Bris, forty points has always been the target — and I think he recently adjusted that total to forty two as the competition at the bottom has started to heat up.\n\nI’m not worried in the slightest about being pulled into the relegation fight.\n\nIt’s not going to happen, but in my head, the reason I’ve returned to my early season thoughts of “This game will tell us a lot about this team and mentality”, for the Fulham game is, I suppose, the next stage of our development.\n\nAre we going to stall and be very content just to sit mid-table and possibly end up as low as fifteenth or sixteenth (which we would’ve said was excellent before a ball was kicked this season), or do we have the skill, desire and energy to push on and try and claim a European spot?\n\nThe argument as to whether this is a good thing for the club at this stage is a moot point, as you can bet there isn’t one player in the squad who is holding back because they don’t think we’re quite ready for Europe as a club!\n\nFulham are one of those teams to whom if the psychology and attitude of the players isn’t right, we’ll lose.\n\nAs a fan, I can appreciate that being “up” for a game against a Manchester City or Arsenal is relatively easy a players want to show what they can do, challenging themselves against better teams and supposedly better footballers.\n\nHowever, just as we might be walking to the Stadium of Light full of excitement and vigour for a match against the ‘Visitors’ or Manchester United, are we as passionate against Burnley or indeed Fulham? It must surely be the same for the team.\n\nYes, they’re professionals and should be able to play at their peak for every game, but in reality, that isn’t the case — only the very top teams have that consistency to turn it on against whomever the opposition might be.\n\nSo, I’m back to my early-season quandary. What will this game tell us about our team? Are we up for a European challenge — or is it “only Fulham”, and as such, we don’t have to put a shift in?\n\nThis week, I’ve seen some criticism of Le Bris, based on the idea that during the second half of the season, his teams are generally not as impressive as the first half. They either point to his second season with Lorient — when they were relegated — or the way we took our foot off the gas in the Championship when fourth place was assured — both of which were defined by extraneous circumstances, in my opinion.\n\nWithout Granit Xhaka, we’ve played four league games and lost three (albeit two of them were against Arsenal and Liverpool), but Xhaka is back for the Fulham game and despite losing Reinildo, we do have a decent squad to pick from.\n\nI think the answer to my question is “Yes. We can push on, and our season isn’t going to fizzle out”.\n\nWe’ll know by Sunday afternoon, but I have confidence in this team’s ability to put a marker down against Fulham and go again. Haway, me bonnie lads!",

    "description": "Workers describe a deteriorating culture at Block, the company behind Square and Cash App, where layoffs continue and employees are expected to use AI tools daily.",
    "fullText": "workers were laid off in early February from Jack Dorsey’s Block, some of the people remaining at the company say the internal culture has devolved to a point where performance anxiety is running rampant, using generative AI is required, and overall morale is rapidly deteriorating. Block is the parent company behind the merchant payment processor Square and the payment app Cash App. Dorsey cofounded the company in 2009 after previously cofounding Twitter.\n\n“Morale is probably the worst I’ve felt in four years,” reads an employee complaint submitted to Dorsey in a recent all-hands meeting, a transcript of which was seen by WIRED. “The overarching culture at Block is crumbling.” WIRED spoke with seven current and former Block employees, who requested anonymity to speak freely about internal operations at the company. A Block spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe layoffs at Block started this month and could eventually impact up to 10 percent of the company's workforce, according to reporting by Bloomberg. Before the headcount reductions began, Block had around 11,000 people on staff. Rather than a one-off event, management has slowly enacted the firings over the course of weeks and told employees that the process will continue through the end of this month, sources tell WIRED.\n\n“We don't yet know if our livelihoods will be affected, and this makes it incredibly hard to make major life choices without knowing if we still have a job next week,” reads another employee complaint from the same meeting with Dorsey.\n\nMultiple sources who spoke with WIRED say they were appalled when Arnaud Weber, Block’s engineering lead, sent out an email after the initial wave of layoffs characterizing them as being performance-related rather than a cost-saving measure. The sources say they disagree with management’s internal messaging about the firings being merit-based.\n\n“As part of our 2025 performance cycle, we have parted ways with teammates who weren't meeting the expectations of their role,” wrote Weber in the email, which was viewed by WIRED. “These departures were based on clear performance gaps, role expectations, and alignment coming out of calibrations on the bar for each level.”\n\nBlock employees are currently expected to send an update email to Dorsey every week, who then uses generative AI to summarize the thousands of messages. In the same all-hands meeting, which took place after hundreds of staff had already been fired, Dorsey said that frequent topics cited by workers in their latest messages included “widespread concerns about layoffs,” “performance anxiety,” and “the tension between accelerating delivery through AI adoption versus maintaining code quality and engineering rigor.”\n\nDuring the meeting, Dorsey reiterated that the layoffs were made for performance reasons, saying that there was “a sizable portion of our population that have been phoning it in.” He also stressed that the remaining workers should be using generative AI tools to maximize productivity, or else Block would risk being outpaced by its competitors.\n\n“Top-down mandates to use large language models are crazy,” says one current Block employee. “If the tool were good, we’d all just use it.”",

    "description": "What scientists thought were four separate star clusters are actually part of one nearly invisible system.",
    "fullText": "identified what appears to be a cosmic anomaly: a faint galaxy with so few visible stars that, according to calculations, as much as 99.9 percent of its mass is dark matter. The remaining 0.1 percent is conventional matter.\n\nThis galaxy, located about 300 million light-years away, is practically invisible. Only four globular clusters, small concentrations of stars that look like isolated neighborhoods in the middle of the void, stand out. For years, these star collections in the Perseus cluster were considered independent objects.\n\nNow, after an exhaustive analysis, a study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters presents solid evidence that these globular clusters are part of the same galaxy dominated by dark matter. Tentatively named CDG-2 (Candidate Dark Galaxy-2), it is the first galaxy to be detected only by its brightest fragments.\n\nThe authors pooled data from the Hubble, Euclid, and Subaru telescopes, three of the most powerful observatories available. The combined readings reveal an extremely faint glow around the four globular clusters. This residual light is a clear sign of an underlying galaxy so dim that the three telescopes missed it on their own.\n\nPreliminary analysis indicates that CDG-2 has a total luminosity equivalent to about 6 million suns, with the four globular clusters contributing about 16 percent of that brightness, an unusually large share. This distribution suggests that, despite its low light, the galaxy is a gravitationally bound system, implying a particularly dense dark matter halo. Astronomers estimate that this invisible structure accounts for between 99.94 to 99.98 percent of CDG-2’s total mass.\n\nAccording to current models, dark matter constitutes roughly 27 percent of the universe’s total energy density and about 85 percent of its matter. Although the exact nature of what makes up dark matter is still unclear, because it neither emits nor reflects light, scientists infer its existence from its gravitational effects on radiation, visible matter, and the large-scale structure of the cosmos.\n\nDark matter is so pervasive throughout galaxies that its presence explains the stability and motion of stars in systems such as the Milky Way. For example, current models indicate that our galaxy is embedded in a halo composed of about 90 percent dark matter.\n\nHowever, the case of CDG-2 is extreme: a galaxy with almost no stars, surrounded almost entirely by an invisible halo. These types of systems, so-called “dark galaxies,” are beginning to appear in astronomical records. Beyond their rarity, scientists value them because they serve as natural laboratories for exploring the nature of dark matter and testing current models of galaxy formation.\n\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED en Español and has been translated from Spanish.",

    "description": "A pragmatic, code-first argument for Ruby as the best language to ship AI products in 2026.",
    "fullText": "If your goal is to ship AI applications in 2026, Ruby is the best language to do it.\n\nPython owns model training. PyTorch, TensorFlow, the entire notebooks-and-papers gravity well. Nobody disputes that.\n\nBut you’re not training LLMs. Almost nobody is. Each training run costs millions of dollars. The dataset is the internet!\n\nThis is what AI development today looks like:\n\nThe entire Python ML stack is irrelevant to achieve this. What matters is everything around it: streaming responses to users, persisting conversations, tracking costs, switching providers when pricing changes.\n\nThat’s web application engineering. That’s where Ruby and Rails shine like no other.\n\nYou need a beautiful, truly provider-independent API. Let me show you.\n\nYou need to specify the provider, create an array of messages that need to be instantiated, etc.\n\nWhat if you want to use a model from another provider?\n\nIf you’re running AI in production, you need to track token usage. This is how you price your app.\n\nDifferent key and different structure!\n\nSame interface. Every provider. Every model.\n\nThis isn’t just about aesthetics.\n\nIt’s about cognitive overhead: how many abstractions, how many provider-specific details, how many different data structures you need to hold in your head instead of focusing on what really matters: prompts and tool design.\n\nLow cognitive overhead compounds: faster onboarding, fewer accidental bugs, easier refactors, and cleaner debugging when production explodes at 2AM.\n\nRuby’s advantage here is cultural: elegant APIs are treated as first-class engineering work, not icing on the cake.\n\nModel calls are only a small chunk of your code. The rest makes up the bulk of it: auth, billing, background jobs, streaming UI, persistence, admin screens, observability, even native apps.\n\nRails gives you a beautiful, coherent answer for all of it.\n\nWith RubyLLM + Rails, the core streaming loop is tiny:\n\nThis gives you streaming chunks to your web app and persistence in your DB in absurdly few lines of code.\n\nLLM workloads are mostly network-bound and streaming-bound. That’s exactly where Ruby’s Async ecosystem shines. Fibers let you handle high concurrency without thread explosion and resource waste. No need to plaster the code with async/await keywords. RubyLLM became concurrent with 0 code changes.\n\nI wrote a deep dive here: Async Ruby is the Future of AI Apps (And It’s Already Here)\n\nSomeone ported RubyLLM’s API design to JavaScript as NodeLLM. Same design. Clean code, good docs.\n\nThe JavaScript community’s response: zero upvotes on Reddit. 14 GitHub stars. Top comments: “How’s this different from AI SDK?” and “It’s always fun when you AI bros post stuff. They all look and sound the same. Also, totally unnecessary.”\n\nRubyLLM: #1 on Hacker News. ~3,600 stars. 5 million downloads. Half a million people using RubyLLM-powered apps today.\n\nSame design. Wildly different reception. That tells you everything about which community is ready for this moment.\n\nAnd teams that switched from Python are not going back:\n\nWe had a customer deployment coming up and our Langgraph agent was failing. I rebuilt it using RubyLLM. Not only was it far simpler, it performed better than the Langgraph agent.\n\nOur first pass at the AI Agent used langchain… it was so painful that we built it from scratch in Ruby. Like a cloud had lifted. Langchain was that bad.\n\nAt Yuma, serving over 100,000 end users, our unified AI interface was awful. RubyLLM is so much nicer than all of that.\n\nThese aren’t people who haven’t tried Python. They tried it, shipped it, and replaced it.\n\nWhen we freed ourselves from complexity, this community built Twitter, GitHub, Shopify, Basecamp, Airbnb. Rails changed web development forever.\n\nNow we have the chance to change AI app development. Because AI apps are all about the product. And nobody builds products better than Ruby developers.",

    "description": "As Colorado lawmakers once again revisit online age verification, the debate is no longer about whether to protect children online.",
    "fullText": "As Colorado lawmakers once again revisit online age verification, the debate is no longer about whether to protect children online. It is about how and whether the tools being proposed can realistically accomplish that goal.\n\nIn recent years, Colorado has joined a growing number of states considering legislation aimed at limiting minors’ access to online content deemed harmful. The proposals have varied in structure but share a common thread.\n\nMany lean on centralized technology ecosystems, particularly mobile operating systems and app stores, as enforcement points rather than attempting to regulate the open web directly.\n\nSenate Bill 26-051 reflects that pattern. The bill does not directly regulate individual websites that publish adult or otherwise restricted content. Instead, it shifts responsibility to operating system providers and app distribution infrastructure.\n\nUnder the bill, an operating system provider would be required to collect a user’s date of birth or age information when an account is established. The provider would then generate an age bracket signal and make that signal available to developers through an application programming interface when an app is downloaded or accessed through a covered application store.\n\nApp developers, in turn, would be required to request and use that age bracket signal.\n\nRather than mandating that every website perform its own age verification check, the bill attempts to embed age attestation within the operating system account layer and have that classification flow through app store ecosystems.\n\nThe measure represents the latest iteration in a series of Colorado efforts that have struggled to balance child safety, privacy, feasibility and constitutional limits.\n\nColorado lawmakers have grappled with age verification policy for several sessions. In 2025, Senate Bill 25-201 sought to require certain websites that publish material deemed harmful to children to implement age verification systems.\n\nThe bipartisan proposal mirrored legislation advancing in other states that targeted adult content platforms and imposed mandatory age checks.\n\nSB 25-201 advanced out of committee but ultimately did not pass and is marked as lost after multiple second reading layovers.\n\nThe bill included provisions requiring that platforms offer at least one age verification method that did not disclose a user’s identity and required compliance with Colorado’s Privacy Act data handling standards.\n\nStill, it faced significant First Amendment and enforcement concerns. Civil liberties groups argued that requiring users to submit government-issued identification or other sensitive credentials to access lawful speech would burden adults’ rights and create new security risks if that information were breached.\n\nTechnical experts questioned whether a state mandate could effectively regulate websites hosted outside Colorado’s jurisdiction.\n\nAnother 2025 measure, Senate Bill 25-086, took a broader regulatory approach. It required social media companies to make commercially reasonable efforts to determine user age categories and imposed reporting and design-related requirements tied to minors.\n\nThat bill was ultimately vetoed by Governor Jared Polis in April 2025. The veto reflected concerns about feasibility, constitutional exposure and the complexity of imposing sweeping platform mandates at the state level.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, SB 26-051 takes a different structural approach. Instead of focusing on specific categories of websites or imposing direct verification obligations on individual publishers, it moves enforcement closer to the hardware and operating system layer that mediates access to mobile applications.\n\nThe shift is partly technical. Smartphones and tablets operate within vertically integrated systems. A limited number of companies control the operating system, the application marketplace, the account infrastructure and the software distribution pipeline.\n\nThat structure creates a defined compliance point. Lawmakers can require operating system providers to generate an age signal and require app developers to rely on that signal.\n\nWeb browsers provide access to millions of independently operated sites across jurisdictions. Cloud infrastructure is globally distributed. There is no single chokepoint on a desktop or laptop where a state can easily impose age verification without fundamentally altering how the open web functions.\n\nSB 26-051’s operating system-level age attestation requirement reflects that reality. It targets the segments of the digital ecosystem where centralized control already exists, even if other access pathways remain available.\n\nAs of the current legislative session, SB 26-051 has been introduced and assigned to the Senate Committee on Business, Labor, and Technology. The committee is scheduled to take up the bill on February 24.\n\nLike prior efforts, the bill is expected to face scrutiny over its constitutional footing, technical feasibility and privacy implications. Recent federal court decisions in other states have underscored the legal uncertainty surrounding age verification mandates, particularly those affecting access to lawful adult speech.\n\nCourts have examined whether such laws are narrowly tailored and whether less restrictive alternatives, including parental controls, are available. That judicial backdrop is likely to shape how Colorado lawmakers evaluate and potentially refine the bill.\n\nAt the same time, political momentum behind child online safety legislation remains strong. Lawmakers across party lines continue to frame age attestation and related requirements as responses to concerns about exposure to explicit material, social media harms and addictive platform design.\n\nThat shared concern has kept successive proposals alive even as earlier versions have failed or been vetoed.\n\nLegislation that conditions app downloads and access on an operating system-generated age signal may reduce friction in certain contexts, particularly within centralized mobile ecosystems. But it does not eliminate alternative access pathways.\n\nMany services that exist as mobile apps are also accessible through web browsers. School issued laptops, shared family computers and public library terminals are not governed by the same mobile app store infrastructure.\n\nIf the same content remains available through the open web, determined users may be able to bypass mobile restrictions. That dynamic has led critics to argue that such laws risk offering the appearance of safety without comprehensively addressing how minors access online material.\n\nIf the objective is to meaningfully restrict minors’ access to specific categories of online content, policymakers face a more fundamental choice.\n\nOne approach would be universal identity verification for Internet access, requiring users to present government issued identification to access websites and digital services.\n\nSuch a system would effectively end anonymous browsing and would represent a profound transformation of the Internet’s architecture, raising sweeping privacy, civil liberties and data security concerns.\n\nThe other approach centers on parental control. Major technology companies already provide device level and account level tools that allow parents to filter content, restrict downloads, set time limits and monitor usage. These systems can be tailored to family preferences and activated voluntarily.\n\nAge attestation mandates like SB 26-051 occupy a middle ground. They attempt to impose standardized compliance obligations within existing mobile ecosystems without requiring universal identification across the open web.\n\nIn doing so, they expand the role of the state in shaping digital identity infrastructure while leaving much of the broader internet unchanged.\n\nWhether Colorado ultimately advances SB 26-051 will depend on how lawmakers navigate that tension. The political appeal of protecting children online is clear.\n\nThe harder question is whether operating system-level age attestation can deliver meaningful protection without reshaping digital identity systems in ways that raise new constitutional and privacy concerns.\n\nage verification  |  app store age verification  |  children  |  Colorado  |  data privacy  |  device-based age verification  |  legislation  |  United States",

    "description": "ESET researchers discover PromptSpy, the first known Android malware to abuse generative AI in its execution flow.",
    "fullText": "ESET researchers uncovered the first known case of Android malware abusing generative AI for context-aware user interface manipulation. While machine learning has been used to similar ends already – just recently, researchers at Dr.WEB found Android.Phantom, which uses TensorFlow machine learning models to analyze advertisement screenshots and automatically click on detected elements for large scale ad fraud – this is the first time we have seen generative AI deployed in this manner. Because the attackers rely on prompting an AI model (in this instance, Google’s Gemini) to guide malicious UI manipulation, we have named this family PromptSpy. This is the second AI powered malware we have discovered – following PromptLock in August 2025, the first known case of AI-driven ransomware.\n\nWhile generative AI is deployed only in a relatively minor part of PromptSpy's code – that responsible for achieving persistence – it still has a significant impact on the malware's adaptability. Specifically, Gemini is used to analyze the current screen and provide PromptSpy with step-by-step instructions on how to ensure the malicious app remains pinned in the recent apps list, thus preventing it from being easily swiped away or killed by the system. The AI model and prompt are predefined in the code and cannot be changed. Since Android malware often relies on UI navigation, leveraging generative AI enables the threat actors to adapt to more or less any device, layout, or OS version, which can greatly expand the pool of potential victims.\n\nThe main purpose of PromptSpy is to deploy a built-in VNC module, giving operators remote access to the victim’s device. This Android malware also abuses the Accessibility Service to block uninstallation with invisible overlays, captures lockscreen data, records video. It communicates with its C&C server via the VNC protocol, using AES encryption.\n\nBased on language localization clues and the distribution vectors observed during analysis, this campaign appears to be financially motivated and seems to primarily target users in Argentina. Interestingly, analyzed PromptSpy samples suggest that it was developed in a Chinese‑speaking environment.\n\nPromptSpy is distributed by a dedicated website and has never been available on Google Play. As an App Defense Alliance partner, we nevertheless shared our findings with Google. Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by Google Play Protect, which is enabled by default on Android devices with Google Play Services.\n\nEven though PromptSpy uses Gemini in just one of its features, it still demonstrates how incorporating these AI tools can make malware more dynamic, giving threat actors ways to automate actions that would normally be more difficult with traditional scripting.\n\nAs was briefly mentioned already, Android malware usually depends on hardcoded screen features such as taps, coordinates, or UI selectors – methods that can break with UI changes across devices, OS versions, or manufacturer skins. PromptSpy aims to achieve persistence by staying embedded in the list of recent apps by executing the “lock app in recent apps” gesture (the full process is described in the Analysis section), which varies between devices and manufacturers. This makes it difficult to automate with fixed scripts traditionally used by Android malware.\n\nPromptSpy therefore takes a completely different approach: it sends Gemini a natural‑language prompt along with an XML dump of the current screen, giving the AI a detailed view of every UI element: its text, type, and exact position on the display.\n\nGemini processes this information and responds with JSON instructions that tell the malware what action to perform (for example, a tap) and where to perform it. The malware saves both its previous prompts and Gemini’s responses, allowing Gemini to understand context and to coordinate multistep interactions.\n\nFigure 1 shows a code snippet of PromptSpy’s initialization of communication with Gemini, including the first prompt used. By handing the decision-making over to Gemini, the malware can recognize the correct UI element and perform the appropriate gesture, keeping the malware alive even if the user tries to close it.\n\nPromptSpy continues prompting Gemini until the AI confirms that the app has been successfully locked, showing a feedback loop where the malware waits for validation before moving on.\n\nIn February 2026, we uncovered two versions of a previously unknown Android malware family. The first version, which we named VNCSpy, appeared on VirusTotal on January 13th, 2026 and was represented by three samples uploaded from Hong Kong. On February 10th, 2026, four samples of more advanced malware based on VNCSpy were uploaded to VirusTotal from Argentina.\n\nOur analysis of the samples from Argentina revealed multistage malware with a malicious payload that misuses Google’s Gemini. Based on these findings, we named the first stage of this malware PromptSpy dropper, and its payload PromptSpy.\n\nIt should be noted that we haven’t yet seen any samples of the PromptSpy dropper or its payload in our telemetry, which might indicate that both of them are just proofs of concept. However, based on the existence of a possible distribution domain described in the following paragraphs, we cannot discount the possibility of the PromptSpy dropper and PromptSpy existing in the wild.\n\nAccording to VirusTotal data, all four PromptSpy dropper samples were distributed through the website mgardownload[.]com; it was already offline during our analysis.\n\nAfter installing and launching PromptSpy dropper, it opened a webpage hosted on m‑mgarg[.]com. Although this domain was also offline, Google’s cached version revealed that it likely impersonated a Chase Bank (legally, JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.) site (see Figure 2).\n\nThe malware uses similar branding, with the app name MorganArg and the icon inspired by Chase bank (see Figure 3). MorganArg, likely a shorthand for “Morgan Argentina”, also appears as the name of the cached website, suggesting a regional targeting focus.\n\nWe used the m-mgarg[.]com domain to pivot in VirusTotal, leading us to yet another Android malware sample (Android/Phishing.Agent.M). VirusTotal showed the spoofed website in Spanish, with an Iniciar sesión (Login) button, indicating that the page was probably intended to mimic a website of a bank (see Figure 4).\n\nThis trojan appears to function as a companion application developed by the same threat actor behind VNCSpy and PromptSpy. In the background, the trojan contacts its server to request a configuration file, which includes a link to download another APK, presented to the victim, in Spanish, as an update. During our research, the configuration server was no longer accessible, so the exact download URL remains unknown. However, given that it uses the same unique bank spoofing website, the same app name, icon, and, most importantly, is signed by the same unique developer certificate as the PromptSpy dropper – we strongly suspect this app may serve as the initial stage designed to lead victims toward installing PromptSpy.\n\nBoth VNCSpy and PromptSpy include a VNC component, giving their operators full remote access to compromised devices once victims enable Accessibility Services (see Figure 5). This allows the malware operators to see everything happening on the device, and to perform taps, swipes, gestures, and text input as though they were physically holding the phone.\n\nOn top of the malicious capabilities already contained in VNCSpy, PromptSpy adds AI‑assisted UI manipulation, helping it maintain persistence by keeping the malicious app pinned in the recent apps list (an example of how the lock is indicated in the list can be seen in Figure 6).\n\nWe believe this functionality is used before the VNC session is established, so that the user or system will not kill the PromptSpy activity from the list of recent apps. In Figure 7, you can see PromptSpy network communication with Gemini AI.\n\nWhile analyzing PromptSpy, we noticed that it contains debug strings written in simplified Chinese. It even includes handling for various Chinese Accessibility event types (see Figure 8), a debug method that had been disabled in the code but not removed. The primary purpose of this method is to provide a localized (Chinese) explanation for various accessibility events that occur on an Android device. This makes the event logs more understandable for Chinese-speaking users or developers, rather than just displaying raw integer codes.\n\nWith medium confidence, these details suggest that PromptSpy was developed in a Chinese‑speaking environment.\n\nOur technical analysis focuses on the PromptSpy dropper and its payload, PromptSpy. PromptSpy is embedded (app-release.apk) inside the dropper’s asset directory. This APK holds the core malicious functionality. When the dropper is launched, it displays a prompt urging the user to install what appears to be an updated version of the app. This “update” is actually the PromptSpy payload, which the user must install manually (see Figure 9).\n\nOnce installed and launched, PromptSpy requests Accessibility Service permissions, giving the malware the ability to read on‑screen content and perform automated clicks.\n\nThen PromptSpy shows a simple loading-style decoy screen in the foreground (see Figure 10). Meanwhile, in the background, it begins communicating with Gemini AI to obtain instructions needed to lock its process in the Recent Apps list – a simple persistence technique that allows PromptSpy to remain active and locked in place even after the device is rebooted.\n\nWhen the user sees the Loading, please wait activity, PromptSpy uses Accessibility Services to open the Recent Apps screen and collect detailed UI information: visible text, content descriptions, class names, package names, and screen bounds. It serializes this dynamic UI snapshot as XML and includes it in its prompt to Gemini. Gemini then returns step-by-step tap instructions on how to achieve the “app lock” gesture.\n\nThis process forms a continuous loop:\n\nThe loop continues until Gemini confirms that the app is successfully locked in recent apps. Here is an example structure:\n\nAll actions suggested by Gemini – taps, swipes, navigation – are executed through Accessibility Services, allowing the malware to interact with the device without user input.\n\nPromptSpy’s main malicious capability lies in its built‑in VNC service. This allows attackers to remotely view the victim’s screen in real time and fully control the device.\n\nThe malware communicates with its hardcoded command‑and‑control (C&C) server at 54.67.2[.]84 using the VNC protocol; the messages are AES-encrypted using a hardcoded key. Through this communication channel, the malware can:\n\nPromptSpy also misuses Accessibility Services as an anti‑removal mechanism. When the user attempts to uninstall the payload or disable Accessibility Services, the malware overlays transparent rectangles on specific screen areas - particularly over buttons containing substrings like stop, end, clear, and Uninstall. These overlays are invisible to the user but intercept interactions, making removal difficult. In Figure 11, we’ve run PromptSpy with the debug flag enabled (kept there by developers) that would set the color of the transparent rectangle, to visualize where they are specifically displayed. However, on the actual device, they are fully invisible.\n\nBecause PromptSpy blocks uninstallation by overlaying invisible elements on the screen, the only way for a victim to remove it is to reboot the device into Safe Mode, where third‑party apps are disabled and can be uninstalled normally.\n\nTo enter Safe Mode, users should typically press and hold the power button, long‑press Power off, and confirm the Reboot to Safe Mode prompt (though the exact method may differ by device and manufacturer). Once the phone restarts in Safe Mode, the user can go to Settings → Apps → MorganArg and uninstall it without interference.\n\nPromptSpy shows that Android malware is beginning to evolve in a sinister way. By relying on generative AI to interpret on‑screen elements and decide how to interact with them, the malware can adapt to virtually any device, screen size, or UI layout it encounters. Instead of hardcoded taps, it simply hands AI a snapshot of the screen and receives precise, step‑by‑step interaction instructions in return, helping it achieve a persistence technique resistant to UI changes.\n\nMore broadly, this campaign shows how generative AI can make malware far more dynamic and capable of real‑time decision‑making. PromptSpy is an early example of generative AI‑powered Android malware, and it illustrates how quickly attackers are beginning to misuse AI tools to improve impact.\n\nA comprehensive list of indicators of compromise (IoCs) and samples can be found in our GitHub repository.\n\nSHA-1\nFilename\nDetection\nDescription\n\n6BBC9AB132BA066F63676E05DA13D108598BC29B\nnet.ustexas.myavlive.apk\nAndroid/Spy.VNCSpy.A\nAndroid VNCSpy malware.\n\n375D7423E63C8F5F2CC814E8CFE697BA25168AFA\nnlll4.un7o6.q38l5.apk\nAndroid/Spy.VNCSpy.A\nAndroid VNCSpy malware.\n\n3978AC5CD14E357320E127D6C87F10CB70A1DCC2\nppyzz.dpk0p.ln441.apk\nAndroid/Spy.VNCSpy.A\nAndroid VNCSpy malware.\n\nE60D12017D2DA579DF87368F5596A0244621AE86\nmgappc-1.apk\nAndroid/Spy.PromptSpy.A\nAndroid PromptSpy dropper.\n\n9B1723284E311794987997CB7E8814EB6014713F\nmgappm-1.apk\nAndroid/Spy.PromptSpy.A\nAndroid PromptSpy dropper.\n\n076801BD9C6EB78FC0331A4C7A22C73199CC3824\nmgappn-0.apk\nAndroid/Spy.PromptSpy.A\nAndroid PromptSpy dropper.\n\n8364730E9BB2CF3A4B016DE1B34F38341C0EE2FA\nmgappn-1.apk\nAndroid/Spy.PromptSpy.A\nAndroid PromptSpy dropper.\n\nF8F4C5BC498BCCE907DC975DD88BE8D594629909\napp-release.apk\nAndroid/Spy.PromptSpy.A\nAndroid PromptSpy.\n\nC14E9B062ED28115EDE096788F62B47A6ED841AC\nmgapp.apk\nAndroid/Phishing.Agent.M\nAndroid phishing malware.\n\nIP\nDomain\nHosting provider\nFirst seen\nDetails\n\n52.222.205[.]45\nm-mgarg[.]com\nAmazon.com, Inc.\n2026‑01‑12\nPhishing website.\n\n54.67.2[.]84\nN/A\nAmazon.com, Inc.\nN/A\nC&C server.\n\n104.21.91[.]170\nmgardownload[.]com\nCloudflare, Inc.\n2026‑01‑13\nDistribution website.\n\nThis table was built using version 18 of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.\n\nTactic\nID\nName\nDescription\n\nPersistence\nT1398\nBoot or Logon Initialization Scripts\nPromptSpy receives the BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast intent to activate at device startup.\n\nT1541\nForeground Persistence\nPromptSpy uses foreground persistence to keep a service running.\n\nDefense Evasion\nT1516\nInput Injection\nPromptSpy abuses the accessibility service to prevent its removal.\n\nCredential Access\nT1417.002\nMalicious Third Party Keyboard App: GUI Input Capture\nPromptSpy can intercept Android lockscreen PIN and password.\n\nDiscovery\nT1426\nSystem Information Discovery\nPromptSpy obtains device name, model, and OS version.\n\nCollection\nT1418\nSoftware Discovery\nPromptSpy can obtain a list of installed applications.\n\nT1513\nScreen Capture\nPromptSpy can record the screen.\n\nCommand and Control\nT1663\nRemote Access Software\nPromptSpy can use VNC to remotely control a compromised device.\n\nT1521.001\nStandard Cryptographic Protocol: Symmetric Cryptography\nPromptSpy encrypts C&C communication using AES.\n\nExfiltration\nT1646\nExfiltration Over C2 Channel\nPromptSpy can exfiltrate collected data to the C&C server.",

    "fullText": "Ex-Victoria’s Secret mogul Les Wexner’s lawyer was caught on a hot mic jokingly threatening to \"kill\" him if he continued giving long answers to questions during his deposition on Jeffrey Epstein by the House Oversight Committee.\n\nThe moment was caught after the committee released its full, nearly five-hour deposition of 88-year-old Wexner as part of its ongoing probe into Jeffrey Epstein’s network.\n\nSeveral hours into the deposition, while Wexner was giving a particularly long-winded answer, Wexner’s attorney leaned over to him and whispered in his ear, \"I’m going to f---ing kill you if you answer another question with more than five words, okay?\"\n\nBoth Wexner and his attorney laughed after this statement, indicating Wexner understood it as a joke. The lawyer proceeded to instruct Wexner to \"answer the question,\" laughing more.\n\nShortly before this exchange, the attorney had urged Wexner to \"answer the question,\" saying, \"I'm sure we all appreciate the stories, we're just trying to answer questions that they actually want answered,\" referring to the House committee.\n\nEpstein Probe Leader Comer Says 'No One Is Above The Law' After Ex-prince Andrew Arrest\n\nThe Oversight Committee heard from Wexner, a billionaire fashion mogul best known for his work in revolutionizing the Victoria’s Secret store chain, about his involvement with Epstein, whom Wexner characterized as strictly a business associate rather than a close friend.\n\nDespite being named a co-conspirator in a recently uncovered FBI document from 2019, Wexner said that he has never been directly contacted by either the FBI or the Department of Justice. He maintained his total innocence during the deposition, saying, \"I was naïve, foolish, and gullible to put any trust in Jeffrey Epstein. He was a con man. And while I was conned, I have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide. I completely and irrevocably cut ties with Epstein nearly twenty years ago when I learned that he was an abuser, a crook, and a liar.\"\n\nThe committee stated it was releasing the full deposition with \"no spin,\" saying, \"The American people deserve to see the testimony for themselves—transparency matters.\"\n\nWexner is the founder of L Brands, formerly called The Limited, through which he acquired well-known companies Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works, Express, and Abercrombie & Fitch, among others. He is no longer associated with Victoria’s Secret. He was one of Epstein's first major clients as a financial advisor, with Epstein being granted power of attorney over Wexner's vast wealth. Wexner also sold his Manhattan townhouse to Epstein, which was later discovered to be one of the locations where federal authorities accused Epstein of abusing young women and girls under 18.\n\nDespite this, Wexner stated that he always kept his relationship with Epstein as strictly professional, saying, \"I don’t think I ever went to lunch, or dinner, a movie or had a cup of coffee with Jeffrey,\" adding, \"My focus was on my business and on community.\"\n\nExclusive: Epstein Emails Released As Doj Says No Criminal Or Inappropriate Conduct By Trump\n\nWexner said he severed ties with Epstein in 2007 after learning of an investigation and discovering that Epstein had misappropriated funds from him and his family. He said a substantial amount of the money was returned.\n\nWexner also testified that he was not aware of Epstein ever staying at a guesthouse on his New Albany, Ohio, estate, where Maria Farmer is said to have been abused by Epstein and associate Ghislaine Maxwell. He maintained that he only had knowledge of Epstein staying at a nearby neighbor’s residence. Pressed on whether he denied Farmer’s testimony that she was abused on his property, he stated, \"I never met her, didn’t know she was here, didn’t know she was abused.\"\n\nHe categorically denied any knowledge of either Epstein or Maxwell arranging women for prominent individuals. He also categorically denied ever having a sexual encounter with anyone introduced by Maxwell and Epstein or having any sexual relationship with Epstein himself.\n\nHe further denied any sexual contact or knowledge of another prominent Epstein victim, Virginia Giuffre.\n\nAg Pam Bondi Announces 'All' Epstein Files Have Been Released, Listing Over 300 High-profile Names\n\nWexner was also asked about his knowledge of Epstein and President Donald Trump’s relationship. He said that he does not think they were friends, but said Epstein \"held him out as a friend.\"\n\nCommittee members also questioned Wexner on a note he wrote in a birthday book to Epstein in which he drew breasts with the caption, \"Dear Jeffrey, I wanted to get you what you want, so here it is … Your friend, Leslie.\"\n\nWexner confirmed that he wrote the note but dismissed it, saying, \"He was a bachelor, so I drew a pair of boobs as kind of a joke, offhandedly, I would say.\"\n\nWexner is the fourth person appearing before the House Oversight Committee in its Epstein probe.\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A lawyer picked by judges to serve as the top federal prosecutor for a Virginia office that pursued cases against foes of President Donald Trump was swiftly fired Friday by the Justice Department in the latest clash over the appointments of powerful U.S. attorneys.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced the firing of James Hundley on social media shortly after he was unanimously chosen by judges to replace former Trump lawyer Lindsey Halligan as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. While the law says that the district court may choose U.S. attorneys when an initial appointment expires, the Trump administration has insisted that the power lies only in the hands of the executive branch.\n\n“EDVA judges do not pick our US Attorney. POTUS does. James Hundley, you’re fired!” Blanche said in a post on X.\n\nHundley, who has handled criminal and civil cases for more than 30 years, didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment Friday evening.\n\nThe firing of Hundley is the latest reflection of tumult in one of the Justice Department’s most elite prosecution offices, which since September has been mired in upheaval following the resignation of a veteran prosecutor amid Trump administration pressure to prosecute two of the president’s biggest political foes, former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nThat prosecutor, Erik Siebert, was effectively forced out and swiftly replaced by Halligan, a White House aide who secured indictments against Comey and James but was later deemed by a judge to have been unlawfully appointed. The cases were dismissed, but the Justice Department has appealed that decision.\n\nHalligan resigned from the position last month after judges in the district signaled continued skepticism over the legitimacy of her appointment.\n\nU.S. attorneys, the top federal prosecutors in regional Justice Department offices around the country, typically require Senate confirmation but the law does permit attorneys general to make temporary appointments for limited time periods. In several instances, though, the Justice Department has attempted to leave its temporary appointees in place in ways that have invited court challenges and drawn resistance from judges who have found the appointments unlawful.\n\nLast week, a lawyer appointed by judges to be the U.S. attorney for northern New York was fired by the Justice Department after spending less than a day in the job. Judges in the district appointed Kinsella after declining to keep the Trump administration’s pick, John Sarcone, in place after his 120-day term elapsed.",

    "title": "AI Could Make Your Next TV More Expensive",
    "description": "Add \"television prices\" to the long list of things AI is changing.",
    "fullText": "The scarcity of RAM brought on by the artificial intelligence boom, dubbed RAMageddon, is affecting more than just the price of PCs. AI could make new televisions more expensive too—as well as—game consoles, cell phones, high-tech coffee makers, and anything else with memory and a processor. But if you're in the market for a new TV, you might be better off buying sooner rather than later.\n\nAs Axios reports, televisions generally require 1GB to 8GB of RAM to run \"smart TV\" features and to process video and data, and the memory units widely found in 4K TVs have more than quadrupled in price over the last year. That extra cost could be passed on to consumers: Analyst TrendForce said last month that a price hike on TVs was \"unavoidable,\" while Samsung acknowledged it may need to reprice its products. That said, a typical television uses less memory, and less advanced memory, than some other key devices, so a potential price-spike is likely to be less dramatic than it is for things like PCs and smartphones. We'll see for sure when manufacturers announce the prices of their 2026 models.\n\nCompanies like Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia are scooping up memory supply to run AI data centers, and most TV makers don't have the market power of these gigantic corporations. \"When memory tightens, prices rise, product launches shift...margins compress and smaller companies struggle more than large tech giants,\" Marco Mezger, executive vice president of memory tech company Neumonda, told Axios. There is good news for consumers, however.\n\nHigher RAM prices have yet to hit the retail TV market, making now an unusually good time to buy a television. Overall, the price of smart TVs decreased by 15% between 2024 and the start of 2026, so you're starting from a good place. In addition, manufacturers generally offer lower prices at this time of year to clear shelf space ahead of new model releases. While more expensive RAM could be baked into the price of 2026 televisions, sets on the shelves now were priced before the effects of the shortage hit the retail market. Plus, some companies price their TVs lower because they make a lot of money collecting your data—unless you do you what you can to stop them, of course. All of which leads to ridiculously good deals, like $900 for a 65-inch OLED TV from Samsung. Bottom line: if you're in the market for a new TV, don't wait. (Though, chances are, you might not need a new TV.)\n\nNo one can say for sure how long the memory shortage will last, but the consensus of industry analysts is that we likely won't see a return to anything we'd consider normal before 2028. AI demand is projected to consume 70% of all high-end DRAM in 2026, so manufacturers are prioritizing it over the less advanced, less in-demand memory chips used for TVs and appliances. While investors are sinking billions into ramping up memory manufacturing, it takes around 19 months to get a factory up and running in Taiwan, and even longer in the U.S., so TV prices will likely remain high into 2028.",

    "fullText": "Creators say they’re offering Africans a ‘hopeful, utopian feeling’ of retrieving objects looted by colonial armies\n\nA new South African video game lets players take back African artefacts held in western museums in a series of heists, amid a growing campaign to repatriate treasures looted by colonial armies.\n\nPlayers of Relooted become South African sports scientist and parkour expert Nomali, as she leaps and dives through museums to retrieve 70 real objects. They include an Asante gold mask that was taken by the British army when it destroyed the Asante empire’s capital, Kumasi, and is now in the Wallace Collection in London. Another object is the skull of the Tanzanian king Mangi Meli, which was taken to Germany after its colonial regime executed him in 1900.\n\nHundreds of thousands of culturally and spiritually significant items were looted from Africa during the 19th and 20th centuries, when European countries carved up the continent into colonies. A 2018 report commissioned by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, estimated that more than 90% of Africa’s material cultural heritage was held outside the continent.\n\nBerlin’s Ethnologisches Museum and Cambridge University are among the institutions to have returned Benin bronzes to Nigeria, for example. Others, including the British Museum, have resisted calls to return bronzes and other looted objects.\n\nBen Myres, chief executive of Nyamakop, which developed Relooted, said: “Real-life repatriation is enormously complicated and it’s been ongoing for decades, in some cases even a century or more … We’re giving people this hopeful, utopian feeling … of what it’s going to feel like when all these artefacts finally come home.”\n\nMyres started creating the game in 2018 after his mother returned from the British Museum outraged at seeing the Nereid Monument, a Lycian tomb from Turkey. The museum says it was brought to the UK “with the full permission of the Ottoman Turkish authorities”.\n\n“She was shocked by the audacity of stealing a building … and she very flippantly said you should make a game about taking this back to where it belongs,” he said.\n\nThe game was created by a team from more than 10 African countries, while voice actors were hired from the countries of the characters that make up Nomali’s heist crew.\n\nMohale Mashigo, the game’s narrative director, said: “If we were going to go as far as researching real artefacts, getting a pronunciation guide for the artefacts, creating these characters from Cameroon, DRC, Malawi and [more], I wanted to make sure it sounded like different voices from different places.”\n\nMashigo created an “Africanfuturist” vision of the continent at the end of the 21st century, with cities and countries that “work for people”, rather than the more fantastical genre of Afrofuturism.\n\nIn contrast, Europe and the United States were intentionally made generic, as “The Old World” and “The Shiny Place” respectively. “We wanted to parody the way the west represents Africa,” Myres said.\n\nThe museums are also not real, apart from the Museum of Black Civilisations in Dakar, where players return the looted objects to an symbolically empty hall before they make their final journey to their home country.\n\nFor the game producer, Sithe Ncube, it was important that the Kabwe Skull, a 300,000-year-old fossil discovered in her country, Zambia, was included. The skull, also known as Broken Hill Man, is in London’s Natural History Museum.\n\nShe said: “Even before I started working at Nyamakop … I just felt like … someone should get it back and it would be cool for someone to do this in some form of media, in a game.”\n\nCreating Relooted was an eye-opening experience, Ncube said. “Learning about the scale of artefact looting in Africa, up to now I still can’t wrap my head around the numbers. It seems quite ridiculous and probably underestimated as well.”",

Counter-claims of a sting operation with illicit filming... it all got a little bit tasty.\n\nThen we had several days of wondering if Marc Kennedy was prone to leaving a lingering finger or guilty of administering an intentional prod?\n\nThe heat has been drawn from the situation since, but the Canadians seem a good fit for the role of pantomime villains.\n\nIt's fair to say they carry themselves in a certain manner...\n\nDismissed by some as just \"ice bowls\", curling follows a similar cycle.\n\nBroadly ignored for three years and 50 weeks, it registers in the wider public attention when the Olympics comes round, but as little more than wallpaper filling the gaps between the more exciting winter sports.\n\nThen, a few days in, we become hooked. People in offices and pubs find themselves discussing Rebecca Morrison's outrageous draw, or the ferocity with which Hammy McMillan brushes the ice. Or maybe just revelling in the Canadian capers.\n\nCome the end of the round-robin and the medal matches, we've properly bought in - the BBC audience for the semi-final win over Switzerland peaked at 3.4million.\n\nMaybe something worth keeping handy for when people tell you nobody is interested in curling...\n\nThen we'll get to Saturday's gold-medal match. Clammy palms, spiked heart-rates, agonising groans and joyful roars - and that's just Steve Cram in the commentary box.\n\nThe Cortina Curling Stadium is a quirky wee place.\n\nFirst built as an open-air venue to host the 1956 Games, it also played host to scenes from the 1981 film For Your Eyes Only, where James Bond became involved in a contretemps with some ice hockey players. Obviously.\n\nThe wooden bleachers and facings from those days still remain within the shell of a modern building. And when the noise rolls down from those stands... wow, it's loud.\n\nThe absence of the Italian hosts might quieten things down a little, but day-upon-day the British contingent seems to have swelled in this high-end resort town.\n\nFor the semi-final, one fan managed to smuggle a set of bagpipes into the arena. The story goes that they were hidden within a baby's pram to avoid the attention of security.\n\nWill they make it in again on Saturday? We'll see. But regardless, the roar of the kilt-clad masses will be there to support Mouat and his team.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

Add us as a preferred source on your Google account here.\n\nThe battle for the final podium spot in the men’s ice hockey tournament is set, with Slovakia taking on Finland in the Bronze Medal Game at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics on Saturday, February 21.\n\nMy top Finland vs. Slovakia predictions and free betting picks expect Finland to win, extending their streak as the longest-standing nation to medal in Olympic tournaments featuring NHL players.\n\nFinland vs Slovakia Best bet: Finland -1.5 (+125 at BET99)\n\nDespite Slovakia winning 4-1 in the tournament opener, Finland generated 65.9% of the scoring chances.\n\nThe Finns just need more finish on those chances to take home the bronze medal and podium at the Olympics for the fourth consecutive time with NHL players, and that's a claim to fame no other country can match.\n\nMedaling will be both a point of pride for the Finns and an opportunity to kick the stink from the preliminary loss to the Slovaks.\n\nimg src=\"https://img.covers.com/betting/sportsbooks/82/bet99.svg\" alt=\"Bet99\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"194\" height=\"62\"\n\nIn addition to the highlighted mismatch, Finland gave Canada a good scare, and the Finns have allowed just 10 goals through five games. Finnish No. 1 Juuse Saros is also sporting an elite .938 save percentage after turning away 36 of 39 Canadian shots Friday.\n\nThe Slovaks lack the same firepower, and I expect the Finns to clog the neutral zone and rely on their depth of defensively responsible NHLers, just as they did against Canada in the semifinal.\n\nMoneyline: Finland -230 | Slovakia +175\n\nPuck Line: Finland -1.5 (+125) | Slovakia +1.5 (-160)\n\nOver/Under: Over 5.5 (+100) | Under 5.5 (-130)\n\nMilano Santagiulia Arena, Milan, Italy\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

Before you type, ask yourself, “Would I have a reasonable expectation of being thrown out of a bar in an average city if I said something like this?”\n\nBe respectful.

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Dodgers begin Cactus League play on Saturday, but early spring training action on Friday showed a high-profile free agent already making an impact at his new home. There were also updates about two pitchers on either side of Tommy John surgery.\n\nPete Alonso seems to be settling in nicely in Baltimore after leaving the New York Mets in free agency.\n\nAlonso, who signed a five year, $155 million contract with the Orioles late last year, blasted a two-run home run in the team’s spring training matchup with the Yankees.\n\nOrioles manager Craig Albernaz said Alonso asked for the third at-bat that resulted in the bomb, as reported by the Associated Press.\n\n“He wanted it, and he made the most of it,” Albernaz said. “It speaks a lot. Pete just wants to play.”\n\nAs reported by Chris Kirschner of The Athletic, Gerrit Cole wowed his teammates in his first live batting practice since Tommy John surgery.\n\nCole hit 97 mph with some pitches and managed to strike out one of the three batters he faced.\n\nYankees superstar Aaron Judge, who grounded out off a Cole pitch during the brief session, said his teammate again looked like the great pitcher who won the 2003 American League Cy Young Award.\n\n“Gerrit looked great,” Judge said. “Excited to see him back on the mound. That was the most important thing. The stuff is still electric.\n\nFull AB: Trent Grisham strikes out on a 95 mph fastball from Gerrit Cole pic.twitter.com/nh5TFcJYZQ\n\n— Chris Kirschner (@ChrisKirschner) February 20, 2026\n\nOn the other end of the Tommy John spectrum, Pablo Lopez will indeed have to undergo the procedure after tearing his ulnar collateral ligament.\n\nThe tear was reported earlier this week, though the details of the procedure have now been confirmed.\n\n“The team said Friday that López’s surgery will be performed next week in Texas by Rangers team physician Dr. Keith Meister,” the Associated Press reports. “López turns 30 early next month.”\n\nLopez missed significant time last season with injuries, but he still posted a 2.74 ERA in 14 starts.\n\nHe will also miss pitching for Team Venezuela in the upcoming World Baseball Classic.",

    "fullText": "Antoine Semenyo has made an impressive start to life at Manchester City. Since signing for City from Bournemouth, the Ghana international has scored five goals and added two assists in nine appearances for Pep Guardiola’s side. Semenyo, alongside Marc Guehi, arrived at City during last month’s transfer window, and the pair have made an immediate impact on their new team. In Semenyo’s case, Pep Guardiola has praised the powerful winger for the impact he has already made for his team. Looking further ahead, you do sense that Semenyo has barely scratched the surface of what he will become as a Manchester City player.\n\nSpeaking ahead of Manchester City’s pivotal Premier League fixture against Newcastle, Pep Guardiola praised the impact that Antoine Semenyo has made since signing for Manchester City. He explained: “It’s not just scoring a lot of goals. The strikers and the players who play up front are so important. Not just that. (He) makes a special rhythm, his versatility to play many positions up front and in the three positions.”\n\n“We knew it and comes from Bournemouth, they are exceptional in the rhythm and defensively and he has it in his DNA. His impact has been really good.”\n\nPep Guardiola also has confidence in Antoine Semenyo’s ability to play on the biggest stage in the UEFA Champions League. The Ghana international is yet to play in the competition, but that opportunity awaits him as this season progresses. Guardiola added: “Antoine we played against him many times in the last years and whether he can be top class or elite, we have to see. I don’t know, when you buy a player from a club, they come here, see how he adapts to play in the Champions League where he hasn’t played before.”\n\n“The biggest stages in the Premier League, yes, but in the knockout stages in the position is a good test for him. How he will react. I’m pretty sure his mentality, I think he will handle it quite well.”\n\nThere is no doubt that Antoine Semenyo, along with Marc Guehi, has made an immediate impact at Manchester City. This City side does feel immediately stronger with their addition. The pair were ready to make the next step in their careers. They forged their way in the Premier League at Bournemouth and Crystal Palace, and a move to a club like City was the logical next step for both players. Antoine Semenyo has made an impressive start to life as a City player. His goals have been crucial. In terms of what Semenyo can become as a City player, he is yet to scratch the surface of what he will become.\n\nAs impressive as Semenyo’s start to life at Manchester City has been, the areas of his game that need to be tidied up stand out. Semenyo has been clunky in possession at times, and he has been guilty of losing possession. He also needs to learn the nuances of Manchester City’s high defensive press. That will all come in time. Semenyo is currently learning on the fly. He is also yet to develop a proper understanding with Erling Haaland, Jeremy Doku, Phil Foden, Rayan Cherki, and the remainder of his City teammates. The more he plays, the more that will all come. So while Semenyo has made an immediate impact already, the ceiling is incredibly high for what the Ghana international will become for Pep Guardiola’s side.\n\nAntoine Semenyo has rightly been praised by Pep Guardiola for his fast start to life at Manchester City. He has already made a tremendous contribution. Looking further ahead, Semenyo has more room to grow as a City player, and that in itself is a fantastic proposition to ponder for the future for Semenyo and Manchester City.",

    "fullText": "No. 19 Clemson turned a tight game into a comfortable win in a matter of minutes on Friday night.\n\nSix runs in the bottom of the eighth inning broke open a 3-3 tie and carried the Tigers to a 9-3 victory over Bryant in the opener of a three-game set at Doug Kingsmore Stadium. Clemson moved to 5-0 on the season, while the Bulldogs dropped to 1-3.\n\nThe game swung on a chaotic eighth. After loading the bases, true freshman Jason Fultz worked a walk to force in the go-ahead run, the first RBI of his career. Following a strikeout, Tryston McCladdie lined a two-run single into right to stretch the lead to 6-3. Clemson wasn’t finished. Luke Gaffney added an RBI walk with the bases loaded, Ty Dalley lifted a sacrifice fly, and Jack Crighton capped the inning with a run-scoring single.\n\nGaffney set the tone early at the plate, finishing a perfect 3-for-3 with a solo homer and two RBIs. Crighton also had three hits and drove in a run, while Jacob Jarrell went 2-for-3 with a homer, an RBI and two runs scored.\n\nBryant grabbed an early lead in the second when a ball off the bat of Charlie Saul skipped past centerfielder Bryce Clavon and rolled to the wall, allowing Saul to circle the bases. Clemson answered quickly. Gaffney launched a solo shot to left to tie it, and Jarrell followed Crighton’s single with a two-run homer to make it 3-1.\n\nThe Bulldogs evened the score in the seventh, capitalizing on a double and a fielding error that led to two unearned runs. Defensive miscues proved costly again for Clemson, which committed three errors. All three Bryant runs were unearned, and the Bulldogs managed just two hits all night.\n\nOn the mound, Aidan Knaak was sharp in his start, striking out eight over five innings while allowing just one unearned run on one hit. Justin LeGuernic followed and logged two-plus innings, surrendering only one hit. Joe Allen entered in the eighth after a leadoff walk and retired the next three hitters, striking out two to earn his second win. Nathan Dvorsky closed the door with a clean ninth.\n\nReacting to Clemson stars landing spots in ESPN’s best QBs of 2000’s https://t.co/LH8iUNef1T pic.twitter.com/foJNyTWKws\n\n— Clemson Wire (@Clemson_Wire) February 20, 2026\n\nClemson’s pitching staff racked up 14 strikeouts, a season high, and has now allowed just two earned runs through five games.\n\nThe same two teams meet again on Saturday, with first pitch scheduled for 2 p.m. Michael Sharman is slated to start for the Tigers.\n\nContact us @Clemson_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook for ongoing coverage of Clemson Tigers news and notes, plus opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Clemson Wire: Clemson baseball takes down Bryant after a massive 8th inning",

Both men are in rough patches in their careers, with Garcia coming in off a loss to Rolando Romero for the WBA welterweight title in May, while Barrios has retained his title in back-to-back draws in his previous two bouts.\n\nThe lead-up to their fight on Saturday has been mostly respectful between the two, and remained that way during the ceremonial weigh-ins on Friday night, though the two did have a prolonged final faceoff.\n\n𝗪𝗕𝗖 𝗔𝗡𝗗 𝗥𝗜𝗡𝗚 𝗝𝗨𝗡𝗜𝗢𝗥 𝗪𝗘𝗟𝗧𝗘𝗥𝗪𝗘𝗜𝗚𝗛𝗧 𝗧𝗜𝗧𝗟𝗘𝗦 𝗢𝗡 𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘 🏆\n\nMario Barrios 🆚 Ryan Garcia \n\n🎟️ Buy BARRIOS VS GARCIA HERE –> https://t.co/FoiaUucafv#TheRingHighStakes | Feb 21 | Live Exclusively on DAZN | @RingMagazine ▪️ pic.twitter.com/WyJ0U7CC1K\n\n— DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nFollowing the faceoff, both men gave their final thoughts on the fight, with Garcia promising a much more exciting performance on Saturday than he gave against Romero last year.\n\n“You’re going to see a ferocious Ryan Garcia in the ring,” Garcia said. “We’re not here to play games. From that start of the bell, we’ll be ready to fight. … We’re going to be ferocious when it comes to that ring, and we’re getting right to it. …\n\n“I’m coming to light lightning, baby. You don’t want to miss this one, I promise you. This is going to be a Ryan Garcia classic. You don’t want to miss this one, I promise.”\n\nBarrios was less animated than Garcia, but no less confident, praising the challenger’s skills while maintaining he may have a surprise in store for “King” Ryan on Saturday.\n\n“Both of his hands are dangerous,” Barrios said. “He definitely has an equalizer with that hook. But like I said, everything we worked on. I also have a hook, I’ve got two hands, and I think that there’s a lot that he has to look out for. …\n\n“I’m going in there with bad intentions. Going in there, like I said, with all the work we put in. I think this fight could definitely end early.”\n\nGarcia vs. Barrios takes place this Saturday night, with prelims starting at 6 p.m. ET and available on MMA Fighting, while the main card kicks off at 8 p.m. on DAZN.",

    "description": "Benn has left Hearn’s company, joining rival promoter Dana White in a shocking move",
    "fullText": "Eddie Hearn has claimed he “misjudged the character” of Conor Benn, after the boxer left Matchroom to join rival promoter Dana White.\n\nOn Friday, it was announced that Benn had joined Zuffa Boxing, which is spearheaded by UFC president White. And the move comes just days after White launched a scathing attack on Hearn, saying the British promoter lacks “vision”.\n\nBenn’s decision to leave Matchroom is particularly shocking given he has spent his entire professional career with Hearn’s company, which even stood by the 29-year-old from 2022 until 2025, during a saga in which he failed two drug tests and could not box on home soil.\n\n“I blame myself, because I just forgot it was boxing, you know?” Hearn told iFL TV late on Friday, admitting he was “pretty devastated”. “I was like... I just felt that the loyalty that we’ve shown would never, ever put us in this position.\n\n“And I just felt that I never really needed to push Conor Benn to sign a new contract previously, and I probably could’ve got him to sign a new contract previously.\n\n“Like I said, I blame myself. I made a mistake, because I misjudged the character. And again, I’m not gonna hang him out to dry, and he will say: ‘Well, it was a big offer.’\n\n“But when I received the email from his lawyer, I texted him and said: ‘I think we should have a call. I think, for everything I’ve done for you, I think I deserve a call. And he said ‘no’, and I was like: ‘Man... f***... I can’t believe it.’\n\n“I just don’t know what to say, other than I just felt that everything that we gave him, the loyalty that we gave him, the support we gave him, would be enough to talk it through – or just get close to a number, but there wasn’t really the interest.\n\n“So, very surprising, very painful, but just another moment in life that you live and learn from [...] You lose a bit of your soul. It’s a little bit numb. There’s a lot I could say.\n\n“He doesn’t think like he’s done anything wrong, but that’s him as a person. Sometimes you can get poisoned.\n\n‼️ Eddie Hearn on Conor Benn signing with Zuffa Boxing: \"I blame myself because I forgot it was boxing and I was like — I just felt that the loyalty that we've shown would never ever put us in this position and I just felt that I never really needed to push Conor Benn to sign a… pic.twitter.com/SAZgZcObRg\n\n— EverythingBoxing | Darshan Desai (@EverythingBoxi2) February 20, 2026\n\n“[Anthony] Joshua, you can’t mention those in the same breath – for many reasons. Joshua is a different breed of class and loyalty,” Hearn added, referencing his highest-profile boxer.\n\nBenn, the son of British boxing great Nigel Benn, released a statement on Friday upon the announcement of his move, and the welterweight said he hoped he could still work with Hearn going forward.\n\n“First and foremost, I want to thank Eddie and the entire team at Matchroom for everything they’ve done for me over the past decade,” said Benn. “From guiding me when I first turned pro, to headlining stadium shows, they were not only with me for those highlight moments but stood shoulder to shoulder with me during the tough times.\n\n“It’s been a journey beyond anything we could have imagined, and for their belief, support and guidance, I will always be truly grateful, but Zuffa Boxing presented me with an opportunity I simply couldn’t refuse.\n\n“I’d love Eddie to continue to be part of my team and for our partnership to evolve in this new chapter.\n\n“I’m filled with excitement and hunger for what’s ahead with Zuffa Boxing. I want the legacy fights, the biggest nights, the biggest stages. I fear no man at any weight, and I’m ready to give the fans the fights they’ve been calling for. I’m in my prime, and together we have bold, ambitious plans.”\n\nZuffa Boxing is being up by White and Saudi government official Turki Alalshikh, the latter of whom has been pivotal to the Gulf nation’s boxing drive in recent years.",

    "description": "The FC Bayern star is having an incredible season.",
    "fullText": "There is something undeniably encouraging about hearing a player speak with clarity, confidence, and humility all at once—and that is exactly the tone Luis Díaz struck when reflecting on his current level. For Bayern Munich supporters, it is the kind of mindset that suggests not just a short burst of form, but a sustained period of influence at the highest level.\n\n“Yes, I think so. I’ve actually been in very good form since I left Colombia. I had a couple of very good seasons in Porto. Things also went very well for me in Liverpool, especially last season. But I think that over time I’ve simply grown a lot more as a footballer and also as a person, that I’ve learned a lot more. It just helps when you’re more mature. And today I feel at 100% – physically and mentally. I think I’m going through a very good time right now, and I’m trying to enjoy that on the one hand… but on the other hand, also to keep doing things right and not be complacent. Because that’s what it’s all about: staying grounded and continuing to help my team. That’s the most important thing,” Díaz told Sky Germany’s Kerry Hau (as captured by @iMiaSanMia).\n\nWhat stands out most is not just the confidence, but the balance. Díaz is not declaring himself finished product or superstar above reproach. Instead, he frames his rise as a process—one built through experience in Portugal and England, personal growth, and the discipline to remain grounded even when things are going well.\n\nThat mentality fits perfectly within Bayern Munich’s long-standing culture. The club has always thrived on players who combine elite talent with relentless professionalism. If Díaz truly feels “at 100% – physically and mentally,” then Bayern may be witnessing the beginning of a particularly dangerous phase in his career.\n\nFor fans, that is the most exciting takeaway. Form can fluctuate, but maturity and mindset tend to last. And if Díaz continues pairing confidence with humility, his “very good time” might extend far beyond the present moment.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt was billed as one of the best games of the college basketball season. The top spot in the Atlantic Ten was up for grabs on Friday night as the VCU Rams visited Chaifetz Arena in downtown St. Louis.\n\nThe game was a rematch of the matchup played on January 7th in Richmond, where the Billikens came away with a 71-62 win over the Rams.\n\nFollowing a Saint Louis loss on Tuesday to Rhode Island, they fell to 24-2 overall and 12-1 in the A-10. The Rams came into the game with a 21-6 record and were winners of 10 straight games. The Rams were 12-2 in league play.\n\nMore: Saint Louis’ stunning loss at Rhode Island ends 18-game win streak; and raises real questions\n\nUpdates of the game will be provided throughout the game:\n\nAt the 8:00 timeout in the first half, the Billikens climbed back to within nine, as the VCU Rams led 29-19 with 7:15 remaining.

    "fullText": "Here’s a recap of the 4A girls basketball state tournament semifinals at Weber State on Friday, with No. 1 Dixie winning the first game to advance to Saturday’s championship. This story will be updated.\n\nFor the first time in 13 years, Dixie’s girls basketball team will play for the state championship after winning an exhausting semifinal nailbiter over Desert Hills 60-55 on Friday afternoon.\n\nDixie coach Kasey Winters remembers the Flyers’ last championship well, as he was there. Granted, he was waiting in the tunnels at Weber State to coach the Bear River boys in the 3A championship immediately after the girls game.\n\nDixie’s girls won that championship over Desert Hills in a thriller, while Winters’ Bears lost.\n\nThe second-year Dixie coach is hoping this time he gets to cut down the nets on Saturday when his team faces the Green Canyon-Pine View winner at 1 p.m.\n\nAdvancing to the championship was an absolute grind against Desert Hills, which plays a relentless full-court game for 32 minutes.\n\n“I think it just wears on you physically and mentally,” Winters said. “We just have to preach like it’s going to be that way the whole game.\n\n“You can’t expect any breaks. You can’t expect to just be able to walk it up the court. You have to be ready for pressure and physicality for 32 straight minutes.”\n\nDixie handled the pressure much better in the second half in a back-and-forth game that featured nine lead changes and six ties.\n\nThe constant pressure resulted in a lot of whistles, with 43 combined fouls and both teams dealing with foul trouble for much of the game.\n\nWinters said the style wasn’t surprising, as it mirrored Dixie’s two region wins over Desert Hills earlier this season.\n\n“Both teams are athletic, they’re physical, we both like to try to cause a little bit of chaos and ultimately it ends up in a lot of fouls for both teams,” said Winters.\n\nDesert Hills dealt with the chaos better early on, jumping out to a 13-7 lead after the first quarter, but Dixie made a push in the second quarter to claim a 23-21 halftime lead despite a dozen first-half turnovers.\n\n“We gave them quite a few possessions just because we weren’t tough with the ball and we weren’t ready for the pressure that we should know is coming,” said Winters.\n\nIt spilled over into the third quarter as well, with Desert Hills opening on a 11-0 spurt to build its largest lead of the game at 32-23 with 5:46 left in the frame.\n\n“Yeah, it wasn’t our best start to the second half, but we knew there was a lot of game left and that’s kind of what we said in the timeout, is just have to stop turning the ball over, get a couple stops,” said Winters.\n\nThe lead changed hands four more times in the fourth as the fouls and free throws mounted for both teams. Crucially, Dixie finished the game 19 of 26 from the free throw line while Desert Hills was 13 of 23.\n\nTrailing 51-49 with under three minutes remaining, Desert Hills’ Ellie Heaton hit a huge 3-pointer to put the Thunder ahead and answer a big 3 from Dixie leading-scorer Izzy Hollinghead — her only 3 of the game.\n\nOrton had a huge response a minute later with her fourth 3-pointer of the game, putting Dixie ahead for good 54-53 with 1:51 left.\n\nShe finished 4 of 8 from behind the arc with 12 points. She was one of four Dixie players who scored in double figures, led by Addison Winters with 15, Hollinghead with 14 and Lydia Shurtliff adding 10.\n\n“I love seeing that four or five people in double figures. It means we’re moving the ball, we’re not forcing shots and we’re just playing good team basketball,” said Winters.\n\nAfter pulling ahead, Dixie forced Desert Hills into three turnovers in the final two minutes and then it successfully sealed the win from the foul line.",

    "description": "Peterson is viewed as the No. 1 overall pick in this year's NBA Draft, but questions about his availability could affect that status.",
    "fullText": "Amid star player Darryn Peterson facing criticism for missing games or leaving them early due to injuries or illness, Kansas men's basketball coach Bill Self says the freshman guard must take initiative to change the national conversation about him.\n\n\"There is a way to change the narrative. Play. Finish,\" Self told reporters on Friday. \"Now, if his body allows him to, fantastic. If it doesn't allow him to, then they'll say something again the next game.\"\n\n\"But that's the way to get people to quit talking,\" he added. \"It's not me saying, 'It's not fair.' I don't think that really keeps anybody from having an opinion on a national level, or on this level, or any level, to be quite candid.\"\n\nPeterson, 19, has played in only 15 of the Jayhawks' 26 games this season. But he has also left three of those games early, most recently Wednesday's 81-69 win over Oklahoma State. Peterson has missed games due to hamstring, quad and ankle injuries and taken himself out because of flu-like symptoms and cramping.\n\nThat limited availability has led to questions about Peterson protecting himself for the 2026 NBA Draft, which could affect his prospects of being the No. 1 overall pick.\n\nSelf says the speculation over why Peterson has missed games or finished them early is misguided, but acknowledges that such conjecture can't be controlled.\n\n\"He hasn't finished games. The reasons why they say he hasn't finished games is 100% false,\" Self said. \"So, at least in 70 to 80% of the reasons why, with what they've said that I've heard. I can't say 100% of everything would be false, but that's the narrative that's being out there.\"\n\nThe Kansas coach asserted the speculation over Peterson's mindset is \"100% false,\" then seemed to say, well, maybe it's not entirely false. But that chatter will only be silenced if Peterson plays and continues to show the talent that makes many evaluators believe he will be the top player available in this summer's NBA Draft.\n\nBill Self on Darryn Peterson:\n\n\"He hasn't finished games... The bottom line is, there is a way to change the narrative: Play. Finish. That's the way to get people to quit talking.\" 👀\n\n(🎥: @KUsports) pic.twitter.com/71bbB7sD7q\n\n— The Field of 68 (@TheFieldOf68) February 20, 2026\n\n[Get more Jayhawks news: Kansas team feed]\n\nIn his 15 games, Peterson has averaged 20 points per game while shooting 43% on 3-pointers. Despite leaving the matchup with Oklahoma State after playing 18 minutes, he still scored 23 points and shot 6-for-10 from long range. Peterson scored a season-high 32 points in a 104-100 overtime win over TCU. That's the kind of production that has NBA teams coveting the opportunity to draft him.\n\nSelf supported Peterson, saying that he's dedicated to basketball in addition to being a gifted scorer.\n\nI don't know that we've had a guy that studies the game, has prepared himself for this moreso than what Darryn Peterson has,\" Self said. \"He loves ball. He can't get enough ball... Nobody's put more time in outside of practice working on their game on an individual than what he has over a lifetime.\"\n\nWith five games remaining in Kansas' regular season, along with the Big 12 conference and NCAA tournaments approaching, Peterson has plenty of opportunity to alter whatever perceptions are being formed about him. Especially if that includes a national championship run. The Jayhawks face Cincinnati (14-12) on Saturday before big matchups versus No. 2 Houston (23-3) and No. 4 Arizona (24-2) next week.",

    "fullText": "The coaching carousel for the 2025-2026 men's college basketball season is starting to heat up.\n\nNumerous programs around the country are virtually eliminated from NCAA Tournament contention, barring a surprise conference championship win. Some athletic directors are already starting to get ahead of the curve and filing away candidates.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Kansas State said it fired Jerome Tang 'for cause.' Will that hold up in court?\n\nKansas State's Jerome Tang was one of the first major dominos to fall, although there's still discourse between Tang and the school regarding his $18.7 million buyout. Kansas State claims it has bounds to fire Tang for cause, which would invalidate the total.\n\nThere are multiple mid-major coaches that are also on the rise and could be next up for Power Four gigs. Names like Saint Louis' Josh Schertz, New Mexico's Eric Olen and Utah State's Jerrod Calhoun have all been wildly successful in 2025-26.\n\nHere's a running list of every head coaching change during the 2025-26 men's college basketball season:\n\nThis story will be updated live.\n\nScott was suspended indefinitely in January while being investigated for treatment of Air Force's cadet-athletes. It was announced Feb. 20, however, that he and the school mutually agreed to part ways.\n\n\"Coach Scott's passion for the game of basketball has long been evident in his competitive and direct coaching style. It was this coaching style that guided Air Force Basketball to some of the program's most memorable achievements during his initial tenure at the Air Force Academy,\" Air Force athletic director Nathan Pine said in the announcement. \"This is a different day, and now is the right time for a new voice and a new approach to drive the culture and success of the men's basketball program, aligned with the Air Force Academy's mission of forging leaders of character developed to lead in our Air Force and Space Force.\n\n\"We thank Coach Scott for his 10 years of service to the Academy and wish him and his family well.\"\n\nAir Force went 97-183 in Scott's second tenure as head coach from 2020 onward. He also led the program from 2000-04, taking the team to an NCAA Tournament berth in 2004. - Austin Curtright\n\nLavin won't return to San Diego for the 2026-27 season but will remain as head coach for the remainder of the current campaign. The former UCLA and St. John's coach has a 46-79 record at San Diego in four seasons, and currently holds an 11-17 mark this season.\n\n\"As my coaching tenure at USD begins to wind down, I would like to pause and express my heartfelt appreciation to President Jim Harris for presenting this life-changing opportunity in 2022,\" Lavin said in the announcement. \"Teaching and coaching at the University of San Diego has been an experience of unparalleled pride and joy. Specifically, I will carry forward the gift of participating in our players' journeys, and will treasure the relationships forged along the way.\" - Austin Curtright\n\nTang led Kansas State to the Elite Eight in his first season at the helm in 2022-23, but it was a downward spiral from there. The Wildcats failed to reach the NCAA Tournament the next two seasons and had a 10-15 record with a 1-11 mark in conference play this season before Tang was fired.\n\n“This was a decision that was made in the best interest of our university and men’s basketball program,\" K-State athletic director Gene Taylor said. “Recent public comments and conduct, in addition to the program’s overall direction, have not aligned with K-State’s standards for supporting student-athletes and representing the university. We wish Coach Tang and his family all the best moving forward.”\n\nKansas State is attempting to fire Tang for cause after he called out his players in a press conference after a blowout loss against Cincinnati. - Austin Curtright\n\nKansas City announced in January that Menzies would finish out the season at Kansas City but wouldn't be returning for the 2026-27 season. The Roos hired former Maryland coach Mark Turgeon shortly after. - Austin Curtright\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Men's college basketball coach firings, changes in 2025-26 season",

    "description": "Stop the count: Mariners enter tie for first place with 1-0 record",
    "fullText": "It’s been four months since the Seattle Mariners played a baseball game. Four months can feel like a long time. A lot happened: the holidays came and went, various roster moves were (and weren’t) made, Rick Rizzs announced his impending retirement, the Seahawks won the Super Bowl, nearly the entirety of the Winter Olympics have happened… et cetera. Still, despite how much has happened, just 123 days have passed since the Seattle Mariners last played a baseball game.\n\n“123 days” feels like a lot less time than “4 months”. I’m not sure why — maybe just a quirk of human bias and perception. For most of the last month, I’d identified more with the “4 months” side of things. It seemed like forever since we had baseball. To have gone from each day being punctuated with the joy of the 2025 Mariners, to each having no clear punctuation at all… well, they call it the bleak midwinter for a reason.\n\nToday, though, it felt like baseball never left. From the moment this morning that the Mariners posted the first lineup card of 2026, all the way through the last pitch that non-roster invitee Nick Davila delivered to close out the ninth inning, today was a continuation of the excitement, joy, and momentum of 2025. Peoria Sports Complex looked and sounded like it was at capacity. Nary a patch of grass in the outfield was unoccupied, and every exciting moment on the field was answered by a chorus of jubilant cheers.\n\nIt helped that the Mariners’ starting lineup was mostly comprised of their actual projected Opening Day lineup. The same cannot be said of the pitching, as the team looks to more slowly bring their big-league staff up to speed. Non-roster invitee Dane Dunning took the bump for Seattle. Dunning, who projects to be a (hopefully unneeded) depth piece for the Mariners this year, ended up throwing 1.2 scoreless innings after working around some early traffic. His fastball, which last year averaged a hair above 90 MPH, sat around 89 MPH for most of the day. The presence of full Statcast numbers in Spring Training this year is fun. However, as I scour Dane Dunning’s February 20th velocity and vertical break, searching for meaning, it occurs to me that the availability of these data may not be optimal for my mental health. Verdict: Dunning looked fine.\n\nThe rest of today’s pitching staff for Seattle was comprised mainly of Guys on the Pile. One highlight was newcomer Cooper Criswell, acquired from the Red Sox over the offseason. Criswell, a soft-tossing righty, induced three strikeouts over two innings, including a particularly nasty one of Manny Machado.\n\nAnother familiar face was Troy Taylor, who looks to bounce back from a disappointing 2025. Taylor’s velocity was great: he was already up and over last year’s average speed of 96. Less great was a hung sinker that Romeo Sanabria whacked 416 feet over the center field fence.\n\nRight hander Alex Hoppe, who the Mariners also acquired from the Red Sox this winter, had a doubly disappointing afternoon. A dinger surrendered to Jose Miranda might have been bad enough, but the broadcasting team outed Hoppe as a true sicko: apparently his favorite player growing up was Jack Flaherty? First of all, Flaherty is literally 30 years old and Hoppe is 27, so I truly do not know when he would have idolized Flaherty. Secondly, even if the timeline did make any sense, Hoppe is likely the first person ever to idolize Jack Flaherty.\n\nFortunately, the hitters on Seattle’s side were a lot more interesting than the pitchers. Luke Raley, Julio Rodríguez, Josh Naylor, Leo Rivas, and Dom Canzone each checked in with hits in their first game back (Raley had two). Canzone made a flashy play in right field, laying out for a sinking line drive to rescue Dunning’s first inning. The real story of today, though, was the young guys. Most specifically Michael Arroyo.\n\nArroyo, a 21-year-old second baseman who just today was revealed to be working out at third base and in the outfield, watched the first pitch he was thrown. It was a changeup on the corner, called a ball. The Padres challenged, and it was overturned. Arroyo fouled off a second changeup to go down 0-2. A third changeup went right down the middle, and Arroyo took it the other way. It looked somewhat innocuous off the bat, but the ball carried, and carried, and carried. 406 feet later, Arroyo had recorded Seattle’s first home run of 2026.\n\nStar prospect Colt Emerson immediately hit a ball in nearly the exact same spot, but it died before reaching the fence.\n\nArroyo’s very next at bat saw him hit another ball hard to the same spot. This one dropped short of the fence, but Arroyo was left standing on second base for a double. Not a bad showing for the 67th ranked prospect in all of baseball.\n\nThe final effort from today that I wanted to highlight was from fellow Top 100 Prospect Lazaro Montes. In the box score, Montes’ day didn’t look overly impressive: 1-for-3 with a single and a strikeout. The single, however, was one of the more difficult ones you’re likely to see.\n\nThe at bat in question was against Padres flamethrower Mason Miller, who we all know well from his days with the Athletics. Montes started by working a 2-2 count off Miller — an impressive feat in its own right. Miller responded by dialing up a 101.5 MPH fastball, which he lost control of. The resulting errant pitch nearly decapitated Montes, who had to leap out of the way. With a slight smile on his face, Montes dug back into the box and fouled off another 101.5 MPH fastball. Miller tried to switch it up with a slider, which Montes pulled for a line drive single into right field. Talk about Big League stuff from the 21-year-old.\n\nCountless battles of NRI-on-NRI later, the Mariners were left standing with a 7-4 advantage over the Padres. Sure, the game was meaningless. Though, isn’t every game meaningless in the long run? Everything, even?\n\nWith meaning ultimately left as an exercise for the reader, I hope you enjoyed seeing the sunlight today, even if it was through a laptop or television screen. Fewer than five weeks remain until Opening Day and fewer than three until Daylight Savings. We made it.",

    "description": "Comment: Precocious talent, mental-health concerns, and a failed drug test – what next for Garcia? Possibly a showdown with Britain’s Benn",
    "fullText": "Ryan Garcia and Conor Benn are a match made in hell, in the exact way that makes them heaven for boxing promoters. For now, a match-up between the American and the Briton is in purgatory, but the barriers could come crumbling down on Saturday.\n\nIn Las Vegas, Garcia will challenge Mario Barrios for the WBC welterweight title, to which Benn is the next mandatory challenger.\n\nNever mind the fact that Garcia, 27, is receiving this title shot on the back of a loss, in which he was dropped and outpointed by underdog Rolly Romero. Never mind that he entered the Romero fight after a year-long drug ban. Never mind that Benn’s last two fights were middleweight bouts with Chris Eubank Jr, in which he went 1-1. Never mind that he went through his own drug-test saga beforehand. All roads lead to Garcia vs Benn.\n\nStill, the terrain is often rocky in this sport.\n\nBenn, 29, has long said his greatest desire is to become WBC welterweight champion, yet he has also barked at any American star who will listen, as well as a 47-year-old Manny Pacquiao. Just a few weeks ago, the Briton was face-to-face with new WBO champion Shakur Stevenson, having “messaged” the four-weight king over a possible showdown in the preceding weeks.\n\nYet the general thinking is that the unbeaten Stevenson, 28, would prove too slick for Benn, in a way that the inconsistent Garcia might not. Indeed, in Garcia, Benn might have found the ideal opponent and perfect rivalry to follow the blood feud with Eubank Jr.\n\nHowever, Garcia must first overcome Barrios, and “King Ryan”’s past struggles in and out of the ring mean that is no guarantee. One cannot overlook his loss to Romero in May, his stoppage by Gervonta Davis in 2023, nor past concerns over his mental health – due to, in his own words, his habit of “drinking every day” before his bout with Devin Haney.\n\nIn that contest in 2024, Garcia was electric. He had gone 3-3 with his fellow American during their amateur careers, but the feeling was that, at this level, the unbeaten Haney would prove too clinical and elusive for Garcia. But Garcia dropped the “Dream” three times en route to a points win. Of course, that victory was ruined by the revelation of a failed drug test, with the result overturned and Garcia banned for a year.\n\nNaturally, that adverse test result had fans and pundits questioning the legitimacy of Garcia’s performance against Haney, but King Ryan may not need to match that level to see off Barrios; with respect, the 30-year-old is seen as one of the weaker champions in boxing right now, and he enters Vegas on the back of two straight draws – one of which came against an aged Pacquiao. So, Garcia is the favourite on Saturday, and the question is whether he can live up to that status, after he failed to against Romero.\n\nIf he can, boxing may have a scintillating new rivalry: one between two admittedly-flawed fighters.\n\nFor Benn, Garcia represents a more-beatable opponent than Stevenson, and a more-marketable one than Barrios. In that way, a Garcia victory would be the perfect outcome for Benn this weekend.\n\nThere are other options out there for Benn, such as a clash with Northern Ireland’s Lewis Crocker for the IBF belt. However, the risk-reward ratio of that fight might not tip in the right direction for the “Destroyer”.\n\nIn truth, the profile of Benn’s opponents from here on out feels more important than their status; that is to say: Benn should share the ring with big names, whether or not they carry title belts.\n\nBut again, in Garcia, he might have encountered someone who can bring both. And so Benn will watch from ringside at T-Mobile Arena, it seems.\n\n“I don’t think he has a big presence in America, but I would be willing to go to the UK,” Garcia said of Benn in November. “I would definitely be willing to go to the UK to fight him. He seems like a fun match-up. He’s gonna come crazy and throw bombs all night and thinks he’s gonna overwhelm me, but he won’t.\n\n“But I would love to fight him. I love fighting Eddie Hearn’s fighters, I don’t know why, I just love to beat them up. He just makes you want to beat his fighters up. It’s just the way he talks, the way he moves, I can’t wait to look at his face and say: ‘I did it again.’\n\n“That would bring so much joy to me, almost more than a championship title. I would be ecstatic just to see Eddie's face, sad and confused. I beat Luke Campbell, Devin Haney – he was representing him, I beat him. I’m ready to beat up Conor now.”\n\nIn any case, Garcia must beat up Barrios. Then, fans will hope the road to Garcia vs Benn remains firm under the fighters’ feet. The press conferences would be engrossing, and the fight itself would be captivating. Yes, Garcia and Benn are flawed, but at this precise moment, they could make each other whole.\n\nEditor’s note: Friday brought the shock news that Benn is leaving Hearn’s promotional company, Matchroom, to join rivals Zuffa Boxing. Given Zuffa’s desire to move away from boxing’s traditional belt system, it is conceivable that Benn will soon lose his status as WBC mandatory challenger.",

    "description": "Justices Kavanaugh, Alito, and Thomas argued that Trump's tariffs were lawful and that reversing them could get messy.",
    "fullText": "Three conservative justices of the US Supreme Court — Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito — broke with the majority Friday, arguing that President Donald Trump had clear authority to impose his sweeping tariff policy.\n\nThe three dissenting justices said the president's tariffs were perfectly legal under the 1970-era law Trump used that says presidents can \"regulate\" importation in the case of emergencies.\n\n\"The tariffs at issue here may or may not be wise policy,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"But as a matter of text, history, and precedent, they are clearly lawful.\"\n\nThe three justices also noted that the majority 6-3 decision is silent on how to return billions of dollars in tariffs that have already been collected.\n\nThat process \"is likely to be a 'mess,'\" as was acknowledged at oral arguments, Kavanaugh wrote in a lengthy dissent that Thomas and Alito joined.\n\nThe two dissents differed with the majority on two fronts: Trump's bypassing of Congress in imposing tariffs, and the legality of the president's invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.\n\nIn the dissent written by Kavanaugh, the justices argued that presidents have \"commonly\" imposed tariffs to regulate imports throughout American history.\n\nInterpreting IEEPA to exclude tariffs \"creates nonsensical textual and practical anomalies,\" Kavanaugh wrote. As with quotas and embargoes, tariffs are a \"traditional and common tool to regulate importation,\" he said.\n\n\"It does not make much sense to think that IEEPA allows the President in a declared national emergency to, for example, shut off all or most imports from China, but not to impose even a $1 tariff on imports from China,\" Kavanaugh wrote.\n\nReversing the tariffs may be an exercise in futility, Kavanaugh added. Even without IEPPA, \"numerous other federal statutes authorize the president to impose tariffs and might justify most (if not all) of the tariffs at issue in this case,\" Kavanaugh wrote.\n\nIn a separate dissent, Thomas wrote that \"neither the statutory text\" of IEEPA \"nor the Constitution provide a basis for ruling against the President.\"\n\n\"This Court has consistently upheld Congress's delegation of power over foreign commerce, including the power to impose duties on imports,\" Thomas wrote. \"The Court has long conveyed to Congress that it may 'invest the President with large discretion in matters arising out of the execution of statutes relating to trade and commerce with other nations.'\"\n\nIn remarks at the White House following the Supreme Court's decision, Trump praised the three dissenting justices while bashing the others.\n\n\"I'd like to thank and congratulate Justices Thomas, Alito, and Kavanaugh for their strength and wisdom and love of our country, which is right now, very proud of those justices,\" Trump told reporters. \"When you read the dissenting opinions, there is no way that anyone can argue against them — there is no way.\"\n\nTrump called the Supreme Court ruling \"deeply disappointing\" and said he was \"ashamed of certain members of the court.\"",

    "description": "Our family went on an ultra-luxury Seabourn Ovation cruise to the Caribbean. Here's what the cheapest room was like and why it was a good value.",
    "fullText": "We traveled as a group of five: my mother, my brother and sister-in-law, their 7-year-old son, and me.\n\nIn total, we booked two entry-level suites — one for my mother and me, and another for my brother, sister-in-law, and their son — bringing the combined cruise fare to just over $20,000 for five people across 12 nights.\n\nThis figure includes accommodations, all meals, a selection of soft drinks and alcoholic beverages, and gratuities. We saved some money on my 7-year-old nephew's fare thanks to the cruise line's third-guest-at-half-price policy.\n\nOur suite measured 302 square feet, plus a 68-square-foot balcony.\n\nIts decor was pretty minimal, but it felt a bit elevated with accents of marble, dark wood, and glass.\n\nDespite being the cheapest option on the ship, this room felt more like it was part of a boutique hotel than just a standard cruise cabin.\n\nThe base-category suite felt thoughtfully laid out, with a seating area, a couch, a table, two beds, and a generously sized walk-in closet. Our clothes and bags easily fit inside with space to spare.\n\nIn the other suite, a sofa bed was set up as a dedicated sleeping space for my nephew.\n\nWe were delighted to find our room's minibar stocked with complimentary ginger beer, juices, and the spirits we requested prior to our sailing.\n\nTwice-daily housekeeping kept everything meticulously refreshed.\n\nSince all of our meals, standard beverages, and gratuities were included in the cost of the cruise fare, we didn't have to budget or crunch numbers during our trip.\n\nWe had most of our dinners in the ship's main dining room, which was so easy. It felt quite formal, and the rotating menus kept things interesting across the 12-night itinerary.\n\nPassengers also had access to The Patio, a poolside eatery with laid-back fare, and The Colonnade, a more casual spot serving buffet breakfasts and lunches, plus seated themed dinners.\n\nOptions for specialty dining included a sushi restaurant and a Mediterranean eatery called Solis, which was a standout for me.\n\nThe menu featured steak, lobster, and whole grilled fish deboned tableside. I particularly loved its post-dinner affogatos\n\nThe ship has a large main pool surrounded by lots of loungers, though we preferred the smaller hot tubs in other areas.\n\nQuieter spots, like the hot tub at the bow with incredible views of the ocean, quickly became our favorites.\n\nLocated on the top sundeck, The Retreat was my favorite area on the ship.\n\nThe space offered shaded cabanas, a noticeably calmer atmosphere than the main pool deck, and attentive, unhurried service.\n\nTo access it, passengers had to pay an additional $150 per day on port days or $250 on sea days.\n\nBooking it on sea days felt especially worthwhile. The quiet setting made it easy to relax or catch up on a bit of remote work on my laptop without feeling out of place.\n\nWe mostly booked excursions through the cruise line for peace of mind.\n\nOur favorite was in Saint Lucia, where a packed day included a catamaran ride, volcano hike, mud bath, and snorkeling.\n\nThe excursion ran late, but the ship waited for us as it had been booked through them.\n\nOn Saint Kitts, the crew arranged a private Christmas Day beach party with grilled lobster and drinks. Later, Santa Claus arrived by Jet Ski to serve caviar and Champagne in the surf.\n\nUltimately, our cruise averaged out to about $333 per person, per night. That felt surprisingly fair considering how much was included in our 12-night trip.\n\nWe also really enjoyed the ship's intimate size. Compared to other mega-ships carrying thousands of people, this 600-passenger vessel felt calm, navigable, and personal. We never felt overwhelmed by crowds, even on sea days.\n\nAlthough children aren't typically the target audience for ultra-luxury cruises, my nephew genuinely had a great time alongside the mostly older guests. His sailing also felt like a great value, considering he was charged half price as a third guest and still had his own proper bed.\n\nFor a multigenerational holiday trip that combined ease, variety, and consistent service, the value ultimately justified the price.\n\nAll in all, we enjoyed the trip enough to book another Seabourn voyage (at a discounted price) before disembarking.",

    "title": "Peacock's next growth bet: selling subscriptions for other streamers",
    "description": "Peacock has approached specialty streamers about selling subscriptions to complement its reality TV and sports-heavy programming.",
    "fullText": "Peacock's next growth bet isn't a blockbuster show or sports deal.\n\nNBCU's flagship streaming service is plotting to sell add-on subscriptions to other specialty streamers on its platform, four people familiar with the plans told Business Insider.\n\nPeacock has approached streamers about selling subscriptions to offer viewers content that complements its reality and sports-heavy line-up, these people said. Peacock expects to start with one streamer this year and is likely to limit the offering to a small number of partners.\n\nStarz, which already has multiple distribution partnerships, is one that's being considered, two insiders said. Starz declined to comment.\n\nTwo people briefed on Peacock's pitch saw it as a way for smaller streamers to reach new subscribers in a relatively uncluttered environment, and they hoped Peacock would eventually offer features such as the ability for streamers to offer free samples of their shows.\n\nThey described Peacock's terms as favorable compared to Amazon, which has a large business selling subscriptions to programmers big and small, from HBO Max to Crunchyroll. Amazon's channel terms vary by partner, but two partners told Business Insider in 2025 that Amazon's subscription revenue cut was over 50% in their deals.\n\nPeacock's plans come at a time when streaming services — especially outside market leaders Netflix and Disney — face pressure to consolidate as they look to continue growing their subscriber bases while remaining profitable. Overall, paid streaming growth in the US has cooled, while cancellation rates have risen in the wake of price hikes.\n\nTV viewership growth for streamers in the US is largely stagnant, and subscribers are navigating an increasingly complex landscape. Streaming services are trying tactics like discounts and bundling to keep people from leaving their platforms.\n\nSome other streaming platforms have adopted a marketplace approach that's broader than what Peacock is contemplating. Amazon is by far the leader. Last year, Amazon reported that its \"Channels\" program accounted for about 25% of US streamer sign-ups, citing Antenna data. Roku, YouTube, and device makers like Samsung and LG also let people \n\nPeacock, for its part, already sells add-on subscriptions to NBC Sports Regional Sports Networks, which it shares a corporate parent with. It also sells a bundle with Apple TV+ that involves cross-platform sampling and a discounted price.\n\nPeacock, with less than 2% of TV watch time in the US, has struggled to grow its share of the TV pie, according to Nielsen. That makes it the second-smallest of the subscription streamers Nielsen measures, ahead only of Warner Bros. Discovery (1.4%), which includes Discovery+ and HBO Max.\n\nUS-only Peacock also has relatively few subscribers, with about 44 million. Its nearest rival, Paramount+, has around 79 million global subscribers, and both are well behind Netflix, which is No. 1 with more than 325 million subscribers.\n\nStill, Peacock has far more subscribers than many specialty streamers. AMC Networks, for example, reported about 10 million subscribers across its portfolio of streamers, including AMC+, Acorn TV, and Shudder, as of the end of 2025.\n\n\"Peacock has been struggling,\" said Alan Wolk, a media industry analyst. \"There haven't been a whole lot of reasons to watch it, so giving people another reason to subscribe is a smart idea. If you ask consumers what's your biggest frustration with streamers, it's always, 'I can't find anything.' So the more you can put things together under one interface, the happier people will be.\"\n\nA global survey by Nielsen in November found more than 46% say it's harder to find the content they want to watch because there are too many streamers, rising to 51% in the US, with people spending 14 minutes searching for what to watch and 49% likely to cancel because they can't find something.\n\nThe survey also showed 66% of people expressed interest in a guide to present content information across all services.\n\nJames Faris contributed reporting.",

    "description": "I traveled the world as a digital nomad in places like Mexico City and Paris after a breakup. The experience taught me about my own resilience.",
    "fullText": "Three and a half years ago, I stood in my New Jersey apartment, surrounded by boxes I was about to put into storage. Tears streamed down my cheeks.\n\nI'd recently ended a two-year, live-in relationship. We loved each other deeply, but just weren't the right fit — and although the split was a gut-wrenching decision, we both knew it was the right move.\n\nI had just accepted a fully remote job, which allowed me to explore moving out of the New York City area — something I had been considering for about a year.\n\nI planned to just travel for a few months before settling down somewhere, but I ended up spending the next three years as a nomad.\n\nAlthough it wasn't quite what I'd pictured when I said goodbye to the apartment I shared with my ex, it turned into one of the most important chapters of my life.\n\nMy post-breakup plan was to put all of my belongings into a storage unit and spend a few months in Tulum.\n\nAfter that, I would travel to Miami and Los Angeles, \"interviewing\" both cities as candidates for a longer-term move. I was about seven months into this plan when I learned my role was going to be eliminated.\n\nLuckily, I was able to secure freelance work, so I decided to continue my travels since I wasn't needed in one particular place for my job.\n\nFrom Tulum, I headed to Mexico City. After just a few days, I fell in love with the food, vibrancy, people, and culture. My one-week vacation turned into an almost three-month stay.\n\nDuring my time in Mexico City, I explored art galleries and museums, learned some Spanish, made friends, went on dates, visited small shops, and tipped local people well.\n\nThese little moments helped me learn how adaptable I truly was. I realized I could make friends anywhere, stay disciplined with my work even while exploring a new place, safely navigate dating as a solo traveler, and be extremely resourceful.\n\nI kept exploring. I took the nomad life slowly, spending about four or five months abroad at a time in places like Paris, Lisbon, Málaga, London, Melbourne, Miami, and Tulum.\n\nBetween travels, I'd spend a few months recharging in a sublease (or a friend's apartment) in New York City.\n\nWhen traveling solo, every choice you make is yours, from where you eat to how you spend your days. I felt immensely grateful for this freedom — every day, it struck me how lucky I was to have every minuscule decision be solely my own.\n\nThat's not to say I felt lonely, though. With each new city and country I stayed in, I was delighted by the magic of connecting with strangers.\n\nOne time, I struck up a conversation with another woman at a particularly intense yoga class in Tulum. She was visiting from Canada, and we ended up spending a whole day together.\n\nI had another memorable experience in Europe. I had been traveling by myself for about three years at that point, and although it was incredible, I was exhausted. I felt ready to return to New York City, but I wasn't sure I could afford to do so.\n\nThen, one afternoon, my spirits were lifted when I found myself in a café in Paris, enjoying a chocolate-chip cookie and a latte. An older woman started chatting with me, and soon, another young woman traveling solo from Korea joined in.\n\nWe all shared stories and giggled as we sipped our coffees. As the older woman left the café, she said, \"You two girls exchange numbers now, and spend time together.\"\n\nWe laughed at the gentle demand, but wound up spending that evening — and the next day, too — exploring the city as a pair. I may or may not ever see her again, but she told me that if I ever visit Seoul, I'll be welcomed with open arms.\n\nI learned that not every place has to be a permanent home, and not every relationship has to last forever; in fact, some friendships might just last for the span of a trip.\n\nThe memories I made during this time will stick with me, though I've since emptied out my storage unit and settled into a one-year lease in New York City.\n\nMy nomadic chapter is closed for now, but my encounters with strangers, small moments in new cities, and solo time with myself left me changed for the better — and will surely inspire my next adventure.",

Allies have been surging fighter jets and warships to the Baltic region in response to Russian drone incursions.\n\nAllied Joint Force Command Brunssum, one of three operational-level NATO headquarters, said in a statement on Friday that the deployment of the Anadolu follows \"repeated airspace violations\" that have been attributed to Russia.\n\nJFC Brunssum called the deployment \"a clear signal to the east\" and said that it \"sends an unmistakable message\" that NATO is prepared to defend its territory.\n\nIt's unclear when the carrier will arrive on station and how long it will remain there. The Turkish defense ministry could not immediately be reached for comment, and neither JFC Brunssum nor NATO's Allied Air Command responded to a request for additional information.\n\nThe first-of-its-kind TCG Anadolu is the Turkish Navy's only drone-carrying amphibious assault ship. It was commissioned in 2023 and is now Ankara's most advanced vessel and flagship.\n\nThe 750-foot-long vessel was originally intended to carry helicopters and F-35B fighter jets, but after Turkey was kicked out of the F-35 program over its purchase of Russian surface-to-air missile systems, Ankara decided to repurpose the Anadolu for fixed-wing drones.\n\nThe Anadolu can carry Bayraktar TB-3 and Bayraktar Kızılelma combat drones, systems made by the Turkish company Baykar, as well as attack helicopters.\n\nJFC Brunssum said the carrier is the largest ship in NATO's Steadfast Dart fleet, which is comprised of 17 vessels, including amphibious landing ships, frigates, destroyers, and submarines.\n\nIran and China have also built their own drone carriers, and Portugal expects to receive one later this year.",

    "title": "The battle over Trump tariff refunds is next — and it will be messy",
    "description": "The process for IEEPA tariff refunds will likely go through the Court of International Trade. Already, over 1,000 lawsuits are pending.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court on Friday overturned the centerpiece of President Donald Trump's tariff plans, ruling the federal government illegally collected over $133 billion in taxes from American businesses.\n\nNow comes the battle over refunds for tariffs paid, which Trump on Friday predicted could take years.\n\n\"I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years,\" he said at a White House press conference, while blasting the ruling as \"terrible\" and \"defective.\"\n\nUS Secretary of the Treasury went a step further, saying about refunds: \"I've got a feeling the American people won't see it.\"\n\nOne reason: Over 1,000 companies have filed lawsuits to claw back money from the government if the Supreme Court overturned Trump's tariffs justified by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nIn his dissenting opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh also predicted the process could become a \"mess,\" citing refund requests tallying \"billions of dollars to importers,\" even as some importers have already passed those costs to consumers.\n\nHere are all your questions about tariff refunds, answered by experts.\n\nTypically, the refund process would be handled by Customs and Border Protection, which collected the tariffs in the first place.\n\nIn order for that to happen, the Trump administration would need to establish a process for handling refund requests. The White House, which didn't return Business Insider's request for comment, has yet to signal plans to do this, said Rachel Brewster, a professor of international trade at Duke Law School.\n\nWithout a formal process in place, claims will be litigated in the Court of International Trade, which will order CPB to issue refunds to specific companies, Brewster said.\n\nIn the past, the Court of International Trade has ordered refunds when it has found particular taxes to be invalid — albeit on a smaller scale, according to Daniel Mach, a commercial litigator at Bryan Cave.\n\nIt'll likely turn to the process that followed a 1998 Supreme Court decision to overturn a harbor maintenance tax, which also resulted in refunds, Mach said.\n\n\"It's been a while,\" Mach said. \"Everyone's going to be kind of figuring out the ropes as they go. But at the end of the day, it's not an unsolvable problem.\"\n\nGiven the number of claims, the Court of International Trade is likely to appoint an administrator or special master to consider each of them, rather than handling the lawsuits piecemeal, Mach said.\n\nGroups that advocated for the Supreme Court to overturn the IEEPA tariffs have urged the Court of International Trade to develop a smooth process for refunds.\n\n\"The refunds will serve as an economic boost and allow companies to reinvest in their operations, their employees and their customers,\" said David French, an executive at the National Retail Federation, in a statement.\n\nThe whole refund process — whether through CPB or through a class-action or administrative processes in court — could take up to two years, according to Brewster.\n\nYes! The cases that went to the Supreme Court were groups of small companies, including a wine importer and an educational toy retailer. But several massive corporations, including Toyota and Costco, have also filed refund lawsuits.\n\nYou can try to get a refund for personal orders hit by tariffs, but it'll be complicated.\n\nIn asking CPB or a court for a refund, you'll have to distinguish tariffs you paid pursuant to IEEPA, which were overturned, and the tariffs justified by other laws, which remain on the books.\n\nIndividual lawsuits for IEEPA tariffs on individual retailer orders, like from Temu and Shein, likely won't be worthwhile. The legal fees would likely exceed any potential refund. But it's possible that some enterprising litigators would put together a class-action lawsuit to make it worthwhile, Brewster predicted.\n\n\"It was an illegally imposed tax,\" she said. \"So in theory, everyone is entitled to a refund.\"\n\nWith reporting by Brent Griffins",

    "fullText": "The move: CoreWeave stock fell as much as 12% on Friday. The AI infrastructure stock has battled high volatility lately, though it's up about 19% year to date.\n\nWhy: CoreWeave's decline on Friday comes after a report from Business Insider that said Blue Owl Capital was unable to arrange debt financing for a data center it's co-developing that is expected to be occupied by CoreWeave.\n\nBusiness Insider's Dan Geiger reports that a debt arranger for major data center deals said that the project, located in Pennsylvania, failed to attract interest because lenders are reluctant to add exposure to AI firms with below-investment-grade credit. CoreWeave debt is rated B+ by S&P Global Ratings, several notches below investment grade.\n\nWhat it means: Despite being backed by Nvidia, CoreWeave has faced skepticism from finance pros who have wondered about the sustainability of the business model of renting out compute to AI customers.\n\nThe company's high debt-to-equity ratio and its AI-dependent business model have been red flags for some investors, particularly as AI enthusiasm has waned somewhat in the last six months.\n\nIn October, CoreWeave's attempted merger with Core Scientific fell through after Trip Miller, the founder of the investment firm Gullane Capital and Core Scientific's third-largest shareholder, announced he would vote against it.\n\nFamed short-seller Jim Chanos has also raised concerns about CoreWeave, highlighting problems he sees with its financials and profitability, and warning investors against owning data center stocks.\n\nBlue Owl, meanwhile, was already in the spotlight this week for reportedly halting redepmtions on one of its private credit funds offered to retail investors.",

    "fullText": "Wall Street is weighing the impact of the US Supreme Court ruling against Trump's tariffs, with investors on the hunt for stocks that stand to gain the most from the reversal of the landmark trade policy.\n\nSCOTUS ruled that Trump can't use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify tariffs. Following the announcement, Jefferies analysts highlighted five stocks that they say have the \"largest upside benefit\" on the court's decision.\n\n\"The removal of IEEPA tariffs introduces a meaningful margin tailwind across our consumer discretionary coverage,\" the analysts wrote.\n\n\"While the ruling eliminates the legal authority for these tariffs, questions remain around remedies—most notably whether companies will be entitled to refunds for duties already paid,\" they added.\n\nHere are five stocks that Jefferies sees as best-positioned to gain after the SCOTUS tariff decision.\n\nJefferies analysts said Signet Jewelers is a primary beneficiary of the tariff decision.\n\nThe company sources roughly half of its inventory from India since the country is a global hub for both natural and lab-grown diamonds.\n\nWith the SCOTUS ruling, Signet Jewelers' weighted‑average tariff exposure falls to 0% from 15.1%, creating an opportunity for margin expansion and earnings growth, Jefferies analysts wrote.\n\nPrior to the SCOTUS ruling, Yeti had a nearly 15% exposure to tariff-related sources, concentrated in its US revenue.\n\nThe company told investors there was a $0.35 earning per share impact from the IEEPA tariffs, meaning that the decision will eliminate tariff pressures going forward.\n\nSharkninja proactively mitigated tariff impact by diversifying its supply chain, supply concessions, strategic pricing, and promotions.\n\nEven with these efforts, the company still saw tariff-related margin headwinds.\n\nSCOTUS's decision will turn this pressure into a benefit for the company, as the already successful operational shifts, along with the removal of the tariffs, will further boost earnings.\n\nNike embedded a 7.7% tariff exposure into its fiscal 2026 guidance. This would have amounted to a $1.5 billion cost for the athletic wear company.\n\n\"The elimination of IEEPA tariffs now flips this dynamic into a margin tailwind, supporting incremental gross margin expansion through FY26,\" Jefferies wrote.\n\nBirkenstock worked a nearly 7% weighted‑average tariff impact into their guidance.\n\nThe SCOTUS news turns the margin headwind into a tailwind to fuel outperformance compared to the company's outlook, Jefferies said.",

    "description": "The Supreme Court blocked Trump's IEEPA tariffs, but he has other ways to impose sweeping duties — some of which are already being dusted off.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court on Friday knocked down President Donald Trump's controversial tariffs, ruling that the president overstepped his authority by relying on a law normally reserved for emergencies.\n\nThe high court ruling, however, only curbed the president's most flexible tool for reshaping global trade. Taxing imports is central to Trump's economic policy, and the president indicated on Friday that the White House has plenty of other options for imposing taxes on imported goods — some of which they are already dusting off.\n\n\"We have very powerful alternatives,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday as he bashed the Supreme Court's ruling.\n\nHere's a rundown of options the Trump administration could turn to next, starting with a new 10% global tariff that the White House announced on Friday.\n\nTrump can use other laws to impose duties on goods from other countries, including Sections 122 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act.\n\nOn Friday, Trump mentioned all of these laws as viable alternatives to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, which the Supreme Court ruled was not intended for tariffs.\n\n\"Effective immediately, all national security tariffs under Section 232, and existing Section 301 tariffs — they're existing, they're there — remain in place, fully in place, and in full force and effect,\" Trump said.\n\nHe added, \"Today, I will sign an order to impose a 10% global tariff under Section 122, over and above our normal tariffs already being charged.\"\n\nTrump also said his administration was \"initiating several Section 301, and other investigations, to protect our country from unfair trading practices of other countries and companies.\"\n\nSection 301 allows the United States to place tariffs on goods from particular countries if they \"either violated international trade law or otherwise acted unfairly,\" according to Rachel Brewster, a professor of international trade at Duke Law School.\n\nIt's a \"broad standard\" that can work to Trump's benefit, Brewster said. And because the law includes provisions that allow the president to form trade deals with other countries to resolve the unfair trade practices, the deals Trump already struck after imposing IEEPA tariffs could likely be \"folded into\" Section 301, Brewster said.\n\nSection 232, on the other hand, allows the president to impose tariffs on particular goods they deem a national security threat, across all countries. Trump has already used the law broadly — he's applied it to everything from aluminum to bathroom vanities.\n\nSection 122 is a blunt instrument, allowing a blanket tariff of up to 15% on all imports from all countries for up to 150 days. The law is meant to address a \"balance of payments\" imbalance, and it's possible Trump could use it as a stopgap measure, according to Brewster.\n\nBefore Trump, no president tried to use the IEEPA to impose tariffs. The 1970s-era national security law says that, in case of emergencies, presidents can \"regulate\" importation.\n\nIt's the law he used to justify his April \"Liberation Day\" tariffs of at least 10% on every country in the world, a 125% tariff on imports from China, and a tariff on any country that imported oil from Venezuela.\n\nIn a 6-3 ruling released on Friday, the highest court in the land said that Trump overstepped his authority by using the IEEPA to impose taxes on imported goods.\n\n\"IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs,\" the ruling said.\n\nOne benefit of using Section 301 and Section 232 is that they have already proven legally durable.\n\nTrump used Section 301 in his trade war against China during his first term. Joe Biden, during his presidency, renewed the tariffs and expanded them by imposing additional duties on electric vehicles and solar panel components.\n\nImporters have challenged the tariffs brought under Section 301 and Section 232. So far, they haven't been successful, according to Kathleen Claussen, an international trade arbitrator and professor at Georgetown Law. Courts have ruled in favor of the government on all sorts of legal questions, from whether Trump had the power to bring the tariffs at all, to whether he followed the right process to add or modify particular products that were subject to tariffs.\n\n\"Big picture questions down to small, detailed nuances — those were all tested back in Trump One,\" Claussen told Business Insider.\n\nThe downside of both Section 301 and Section 232 is that each requires investigations from federal agencies to establish the tariffs, which can take months.\n\nA typical Section 301 United States Trade Representative investigation — to determine whether another country truly acted unfairly, and how high the duties should be in response — usually takes six months, Brewster said.\n\nBut the Trump administration can move quickly if it wants to, Claussen said. It can skip procedural steps, like convening a private sector committee or holding hearings.\n\n\"I do think people who think we're talking about, 'Oh, this is going to take a couple of months for them to stand up 301 — I don't think it will take that long,\" Claussen said.\n\nTrump could also dust off Section 338, a law passed during the Great Depression that has never been used to impose tariffs. The law allows duties of up to 50% for goods from specific countries that \"discriminate\" against US exports.\n\nThe law's language is broad and \"squishy,\" Claussen said, and it could be vulnerable to legal challenges. But it's possible the Trump administration would use it anyway.\n\n\"There's no question in my mind that the government is preparing all possible tools and options for the president,\" Claussen said. \"That's what you would imagine that they should be doing. So I would think that they are considering 338, I would think that they're considering 122 and just sort of teeing anything up so the president can choose what he thinks most appropriate.\"",

Microsoft executive Asha Sharma will become the new executive vice president and CEO of Microsoft Gaming, reporting directly to Nadella.\n\n\"Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in the email.\n\n\"He expanded our reach across PC, mobile, and cloud; nearly tripled the size of the business; helped shape our strategy through the acquisitions of Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax, and Minecraft; and strengthened our culture across our studios and platforms,\" Nadella wrote.\n\nSpencer's departure marks the end of an era for Xbox. Under Spencer, Microsoft transformed gaming into a subscription- and services-driven business and completed the largest acquisition in its history, paying $69 billion for Activision Blizzard.\n\nSharma joined Microsoft in 2024 and has worked in the CoreAI group under Jay Parikh. She was previously a chief operating Officer at Instacart and a vice president of product and engineering at Meta before that.\n\nXbox's president and chief operations officer, Sarah Bond, is leaving the company, while longtime Microsoft gaming executive Matt Booty will become executive vice president and chief content officer, reporting to Sharma.\n\nGaming has been part of Microsoft from the start. Flight Simulator shipped before Windows, and you can practically ray‑trace a line from DirectX in the '90s to the accelerated‑compute era we're in today.\n\nAs we celebrate Xbox's 25th year, the opportunity and innovation agenda in front of us is expansive. Today we reach over 500 million monthly active users, are a top publisher across all platforms, and continue to innovate across gaming hardware, content and community, in service of creators and players everywhere.\n\nI am long on gaming and its role at the center of our consumer ambition, and as we look ahead, I'm excited to share that Asha Sharma will become Executive Vice President and CEO, Microsoft Gaming, reporting to me. Over the last two years at Microsoft, and previously as Chief Operating Officer at Instacart and a Vice President at Meta, Asha has helped build and scale services that reach billions of people and support thriving consumer and developer ecosystems. She brings deep experience building and growing platforms, aligning business models to long-term value, and operating at global scale, which will be critical in leading our gaming business into its next era of growth.\n\nMatt Booty will become Executive Vice President and Chief Content Officer, reporting to Asha. Matt's career reflects a lifelong commitment to games and to the people who make them. Under his leadership, Microsoft Gaming has grown to span nearly 40 studios across Xbox, Bethesda, Activision Blizzard, and King, which are home to beloved franchises including Halo, The Elder Scrolls, Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Candy Crush, and Fallout.\n\nTogether, Asha and Matt have the right combination of consumer product leadership and gaming depth to push our platform innovation and content pipeline forward. Last year, Phil Spencer made the decision to retire from the company, and since then we've been talking about succession planning. I want to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership and partnership. Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it. He expanded our reach across PC, mobile, and cloud; nearly tripled the size of the business; helped shape our strategy through the acquisitions of Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax, and Minecraft; and strengthened our culture across our studios and platforms. I've long admired Phil's unwavering commitment to players, creators, and his team, and I am personally grateful for his leadership and counsel. He will continue working closely with Asha to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nWe have extraordinary creative talent across our studios and a global platform that is second to none. I'm excited for how we will capture the opportunity ahead and define what comes next, while staying grounded in what players and creators value.\n\nPlease join me in congratulating Asha and Matt on their new roles, and in thanking Phil for everything he has done for Microsoft and for our industry.\n\nWhen I walked through Microsoft's doors as an intern in June of 1988, I could never have imagined the products I'd help build, the players and customers we'd serve, or the extraordinary teams I'd be lucky enough to join. It's been an epic ride and truly the privilege of a lifetime.\n\nLast fall, I shared with Satya that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life. From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we've built. Xbox has always been more than a business. It's a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead.\n\nToday marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team. Working with her over the past several months has given me tremendous confidence. She brings genuine curiosity, clarity and a deep commitment to understanding players, creators, and the decisions that shape our future. We know this is an important moment for our fans, partners, and team, and we're committed to getting it right. I'll remain in an advisory role through the summer to support a smooth handoff.\n\nI'm also grateful for the strength of our studios organization. Matt Booty and our studios teams continue to build an incredible portfolio, and I have full confidence in the leadership and creative momentum across our global studios. I want to congratulate Matt on his promotion to EVP and Chief Content Officer.\n\nAs part of this transition, Sarah Bond has decided to leave Microsoft to begin a new chapter. Sarah has been instrumental during a defining period for Xbox, shaping our platform strategy, expanding Game Pass and cloud gaming, supporting new hardware launches, and guiding some of the most significant moments in our history. I'm grateful for her partnership and the impact she's had, and I wish her the very best in what comes next.\n\nMost of all, to everyone in Microsoft Gaming, I want to say \"thank you\". I've learned so much from this team and community, grown alongside you, and been continually inspired by the creativity, courage, and care you bring to players, creators, and to one another every day.\n\nI'm incredibly proud of what we've built together over the last 25 years, and I have complete confidence in all of you and in the opportunities ahead. I'll be cheering you on in this next chapter as Xbox's proudest fan and player.\n\nToday I begin my role as CEO of Microsoft Gaming.\n\nI feel two things at once: humility and urgency.\n\nHumility because this team has built something extraordinary over decades. Urgency because gaming is in a period of rapid change, and we need to move with clarity and conviction.\n\nI am stepping into work shaped by generations of artists, engineers, designers, writers, musicians, operators and more who create worlds that have brought joy and deep personal meaning to hundreds of millions of players. The level of craft here is exceptional, and it is amplified by Xbox, which was founded in the belief that the power of games connect people and push the industry forward.\n\nThank you to Phil for his leadership, and to every studio, platform, and operations team that built this foundation. We are stewards of some of the most loved stories and characters in entertainment and bring players and creators together around the fun and community of gaming in entirely new ways.\n\nMy first job is simple: understand what makes this work and protect it.\n\nThat starts with three commitments.\n\nEverything begins here. We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything. Unforgettable characters, stories that make us feel, innovative game play, and creative excellence. We will empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas. We will take risks. We will enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most.\n\nI promoted Matt Booty in honor of this commitment. He understands the craft and the challenges of building great games, has led teams that deliver award-winning work, and has earned the trust of game developers across the industry.\n\nWe will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world.\n\nWe will celebrate our roots with a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console which has shaped who we are. It connects us to the players and fans who invest in Xbox, and to the developers who build ambitious experiences for it.\n\nGaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware. As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise.\n\nWe are witnessing the reinvention of play.\n\nTo meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters, and worlds that people love. But we will not treat those worlds as static IP to milk and monetize. We will build a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories.\n\nAs monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.\n\nThe next 25 years belong to the teams who dare to build something surprising, something no one else is willing to try, and have the patience to see it through. We have done this before, and I am here to help us do it again. I want to return to the renegade spirit that built Xbox in the first place. It will require us to relentlessly question everything, revisit processes, protect what works, and be brave enough to change what does not.\n\nThank you for welcoming me into this journey.\n\nI read Phil's note with much gratitude. He has been a steady champion for game creators and our studio teams, and I've learned so much from his leadership over the years. All our games have benefited from his foundational support. I'm also grateful to Satya for his ongoing commitment to gaming and holding a vision of how it can connect back to the larger company.\n\nLooking forward, I'm excited to partner with Asha as our next CEO. Our first conversations centered on her commitment to making great games and the role that plays in our overall success. She asks questions, pushes for clarity, and wants our choices grounded in player and developer needs. That mindset matters as the industry around us is changing quickly: how players engage, how games are made, and how business models and platforms evolve.\n\nWe have good reasons to believe in what's ahead. This organization and its franchises have navigated change for decades, and our strength comes from teams who know how to adapt and keep delivering. That confidence is grounded in a strong pipeline of established franchises, new bets we believe in, and clear player demand for what we are building.\n\nMy focus is on supporting the teams and leaders we have in place and creating the conditions for them to do their best work. To be clear, there are no organizational changes underway for our studios.\n\nThanks for everything you do for players and for each other.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "A 6-3 majority struck down one of President Donald Trump's favored methods to impose tariffs.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump lashed out at the Supreme Court after justices dealt a sweeping rebuke of his trade policy.\n\nIn some of his harshest criticisms ever of the nation's highest court, Trump said some justices should be \"absolutely ashamed\" for siding against him. Without evidence, Trump accused justices of being \"swayed by foreign interests.\" He added that the majority opinion was \"almost like not written by smart people.\"\n\n\"Others think they're being politically correct, which has happened before far too often with members of this court,\" he said. \"They are just being fools and lapdogs for the RINOS and radical left Democrats.\"\n\nTrump said that it was fair to question the loyalty of \"our people,\" a likely reference to his two appointees, Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch, who sided against the administration's view.\n\nTrump said that due to the \"deeply disappointing\" decision, \"alternatives\" will be used to preserve his trade agenda. Later, he said he would use a separate authority to impose a 10% global tariff on top of any existing tariffs.\n\n\"The Supreme Court did not overrule tariffs. They merely overruled a particular use of IEPPA tariffs,\" Trump said, citing the law in question in the court's ruling.\n\nA White House official later said that countries being tariffed under the authority the Supreme Court struck down will now be subject to the 10% tariff.\n\n\"With IEEPA no longer applicable, those countries will now be tariffed at the global 10% tariff using the Section 122 legal authority,\" the official said in a statement to Business Insider. \"This is, however, only temporary as the Administration will be pursuing other legal authorities to implement more appropriate or pre-negotiated tariff rates.\"\n\nLeft unclear is what the administration will do in the long term.\n\nSection 122 tariffs, which Trump said he would use for a global tariff, can only be imposed for 150 days. After that, Congress must vote to extend. It's unclear if such a vote could pass just months before the midterm elections.\n\nAsked if the government will now have to issue refunds, Trump again criticized the court for not addressing the issue.\n\n\"I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years,\" he said.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that Trump did not have the power under a 1970s law to unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs as he did in April 2025 during \"Liberation Day.\" The ruling does not invalidate all of Trump's tariffs, as other tariffs were imposed under different authorities. It does mean that Trump is significantly more limited in imposing broad, general tariffs against countries, one of his preferred methods in trade negotiations.\n\n\"The President must 'point to clear congressional authorization' to justify his extraordinary assertion to justify his extraordinary assertion of the power to impose tariffs,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion. \"He cannot.\"\n\nTrump, who has repeatedly proclaimed himself to be \"Tariff Man,\" has also repeatedly suggested that he would use revenue from tariffs to pay for a range of things, from refund checks to paying down the national debt to helping fund childcare.\n\nIn total, Treasury Department data showed that the US has collected more than $133 billion in tariffs as of December.\n\nThe White House and top Trump administration officials have repeatedly suggested that if the court struck down most of Trump's tariffs that it would be a mess to sort out any potential refund process.\n\n\"It won't be a problem if we have to do it, but I can tell you that if it happens - which I don't think it's going to - it's just a corporate boondoggle,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently told Reuters. \"Costco, who's suing the US government, are they going to give the money back to their clients?\"\n\nRoberts' opinion did not explicitly address a potential refund process, a point that Justice Brett Kavanaugh seized on in his 63-page dissent.\n\n\"The Court says nothing today about whether, and if so how, the Government should go about returning the billions of dollars that it has collected from importers,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"But that process is likely to be a 'mess,' as was acknowledged at oral argument.\"\n\nIn addition to criticizing the justices in the majority, Trump offered effusive praise for Kavanaugh, who wrote a 63-page dissenting opinion.\n\n\"I'm so proud of him,\" Trump said, suggesting Kavanaugh's stock has \"gone way up.\"\n\nThis is unlikely to be Trump's last word on the soon-to-be historic ruling. On Tuesday, he is set to deliver his annual State of the Union address.\n\nHistorically, the justices occupy front-row seats on the House floor.",

    "description": "Govs. Gavin Newsom and JB Pritzker demand Trump pay Americans $1,700 in tariff refunds after the Supreme Court ruling.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump previously promised Americans tariff dividend checks, but if Democrats have their way, he could be issuing refunds instead.\n\nAfter a Supreme Court ruling on Friday struck down Trump's tariffs levied under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Democratic lawmakers were quick to demand that the president repay Americans through tariff refunds.\n\n\"Donald Trump should return that money immediately. He has an obligation,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said on Friday. \"$1,751 per family that were taxed by Donald Trump. He took hundreds of billions of dollars from working folks, from the ag community, from small businesses for this vanity play, this illegal action, and he finally was held to account. The rule of law won out.\"\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker sent a letter to Trump calling for refunds to families in his state.\n\n\"Your tariff taxes wreaked havoc on farmers, enrage our allies, and sent grocery store prices through the roof,\" Pritzker said in the letter. \"On behalf of the people of Illinois, I demand a refund of $1,700 for every family in Illinois.\"\n\nThe governor also sent an invoice billing that amount for more than 5.1 million Illinois families, totaling more than $8.6 billion. The invoice said it was \"PAST DUE - DELINQUENT.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment, White House spokesman Kush Desai responded in part by saying if Pritzker \"really cared about delivering economic relief for Illinois, he'd start with his own state government instead of chasing another stupid headline.\"\n\nThe offices of Newsom and Pritzker did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBoth Newsom and Pritzker are considered potential candidates for the presidential election in 2028, and they've both been highly critical of Trump.\n\nThe governors appeared to be basing their requests for refunds of that amount on a report released this month by Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee in Congress. The report found American families paid an average of $1,745 in tariff costs between February 2025 and January 2026, for a total of over $231 billion paid by consumers.\n\nOther studies, including from Harvard Business School and The Budget Lab at Yale, have found that tariff costs are largely paid by American businesses and consumers.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday ruled that tariffs issued under the IEEPA, a national security act, had exceeded the president's authority. Trump denounced the decision and said he would pursue additional tariffs through other avenues.\n\nIn November, Trump touted the money being collected from tariffs and floated the idea of sending $2,000 tariff dividend checks to middle and low-income Americans, though issuing such checks would likely have required an act of Congress. In January, Trump gave mixed messages about his plans for tariff rebate checks.\n\nNow, with the IEEPA tariffs struck down, it's likely some American businesses will try to receive refunds for the tariff costs they paid.\n\nDespite Democrats' stance on the issue, there's a lot of uncertainty about whether or how refunds would happen.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling did not touch on issuing tariff refunds.\n\nWhen Trump was asked Friday if the government would now have to issue refunds, he said, \"I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years.\"\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Friday it was \"unlikely\" Americans would receive tariff refunds.\n\n\"I got a feeling the American people won't see it,\" Bessent said, adding, \"My sense is that could be dragged out for weeks, months, years.\"",

    "description": "In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court upended President Donald Trump's trade agenda and left many major questions unanswered.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump issued a stinging rebuke of the Supreme Court for striking down most of his tariffs.\n\n\"Others think they're being politically correct, which has happened before far too often with members of this court,\" Trump said. \"They are just being fools and lapdogs for the RINOS and radical left Democrats.\"\n\nTrump vowed to press on with his trade agenda, starting with a sweeping 10% global tariff that will be in addition to any existing tariffs. The president has other avenues to impose tariffs, including through Section 232.\n\nWhile he criticized the justices who sided against him, Trump lavished praise on the three who dissented, Brett Kavanaugh, Samuel Alito, and Clarence Thomas.\n\n\"I would like to thank Justice Kavanaugh for, frankly, his genius and his great ability,\" Trump said.\n\nWedbush's Dan Ives said the ruling could be a \"net positive\" for tech companies if refunds are issued.\n\n\"With ~$133.5 billion in tariff revenue up for grabs if the US tariff ruling leads to refunds for organizations, we believe this would act as a net positive for tech with financial relief for many companies while creating greater supply chain visibility especially coming from the Asia supply chain,\" Ives wrote in a note. \"This will be a very noisy situation but for the tech space and AI trade it's a net positive out of the gates in our view.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts' ruling did not explicitly address what companies that paid the now-invalidated tariffs may be entitled to.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent lamented the ruling, adding that it was \"unlikely\" Americans will ever see tariff refunds.\n\n\"I got a feeling the American people won't see it,\" Bessent said during a speech before the Economic Club of Dallas.\n\nLike Trump, Bessent noted the administration has other alternatives to impose tariffs. He also echoed the president's point that it may take years to sort out any potential refunds.\n\n\"My sense is that could be dragged out for weeks, months, years,\" Bessent said about the coming court fights.\n\nJefferies analysts said five consumer stocks are poised to get a big boost on the heels of the ruling.\n\nThe firm's analysts said Signet Jewelers, Yeti, Sharkninja, Nike, and Birkenstock are all set to gain do to \"a meaningful margin tailwind.\"\n\nRaymond James Washington Policy Analyst Ed Mills said he expects any sort of refund process to be \"lengthy and challenging.\"\n\n\"We expect that the process for firms to receive tariff refunds will be lengthy and challenging, with litigants needing to bring individual cases or participate in class action (vs. automatic refunds),\" Mills wrote in a note.\n\nMills added that Costco and other firms have sued to ensure their claims are not invalidated by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's deadline for disputing tariff bills. Costco's case remains ongoing.\n\nFormer Deputy Director of the National Economic Council Bharat Ramamurti said \"rational businesses\" should understand that tariffs aren't going away.\n\n\"The point is that any rational US business is going to anticipate the possibility of new tariffs, which is going to: (a) deter them from passing along any short-term cost savings to consumers; and (b) continue to fuel the uncertainty that is putting a damper on certain forms of business investment in the US,\" Ramamurti wrote in a post on Substack.\n\nThe short-term economic impact is unclear, Ramamurti wrote, because the court's opinion did not address major issues like potential refunds.\n\nOn the topic of refunds, Erica York, the vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, said it should actually be quite easy for the Trump administration to issue refunds.\n\n\"The IEEPA tariffs have brought in around $160 billion in tariff payments. For context, the IRS refunds taxpayers more than $300 billion in income tax overpayments each year,\" York wrote on X. \"Refunding tariff payments to the importer of record should follow a similar, straightforward process.\"\n\nInvestor Jason Calacanis said the court's ruling shows why Trump needs to work with Congress to impose tariffs.\n\n\"MAGA and AFAO loyalists will lose their minds when President @AOC and VP @ZohranKMamdani start using 'emergency powers' to shape their socialist agenda,\" Calacanis wrote on X. \"This is why the Founding Fathers limited executive power and balanced the branches of government.\"\n\nWhile often supportive of Trump, Calacanis and others in the business and tech space have expressed skepticism of Trump's sweeping tariffs.\n\nThe US Chamber of Commerce and the National Retail Federation hailed the court's decision.\n\n\"Swift refunds of the impermissible tariffs will be meaningful for the more than 200,000 small business importers in this country and will help support stronger economic growth this year,\" Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement.\n\nThe National Retail Federation called on a lower court \"to ensure a seamless process to refund the tariffs.\"\n\n\"The refunds will serve as an economic boost and allow companies to reinvest in their operations, their employees and their customers,\" David French, executive vice president of government relations, said in a statement.\n\nCanadian Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc said the decision \"strengthens\" his country's view that Trump's emergency tariffs were \"unjustified.\"\n\n\"Although Canada has concluded the best trade agreement with the United States among all its trading partners, we recognize that there is still much to be done to support Canadian businesses and workers who continue to be affected by the tariffs imposed under Section 232 on the steel, aluminum, and automotive sectors,\" LeBlance wrote in a post on X.\n\nNotably, Section 232 tariffs are not included in Friday's ruling, underscoring that Trump still has additional tools at his disposal for his trade policy.\n\nVice President JD Vance called the decision \"lawlessness from the Court.\"\n\n\"Today, the Supreme Court decided that Congress, despite giving the president the ability to 'regulate imports,' didn't actually mean it,\" Vance wrote in a post on X. \"This is lawlessness from the Court, plain and simple. And its only effect will be to make it harder for the president to protect American industries and supply chain resiliency.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson said Republicans would find a way forward after the setback.\n\n\"No one can deny that the President's use of tariffs has brought in billions of dollars and created immense leverage for America's trade strategy and for securing strong, reciprocal America-first trade agreements with countries that had been taking advantage of American workers for decades,\" Johnson said in a statement posted on X. \"Congress and the Administration will determine the best path forward in the coming weeks.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries took a victory lap after the ruling.\n\n\"Donald Trump's failed economic policies and global trade war waged with irresponsible, on-again, off-again tariffs on our allies and trading partners have generated massive uncertainty, threatened the economic well-being of the American people and damaged our country's standing around the world,\" Jeffries said in a statement.\n\nThe Top House Democrat said his party will \"push back aggressively in Congress\" on Trump's tariffs.\n\nDespite being in the minority, all but one House Democrat recently joined with six Republicans to approve a largely symbolic rebuke of Trump's emergency tariffs on Canada. It was unclear if the resolution would have passed in the Senate. Trump was widely expected to veto it if it arrived on his desk.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled on Friday that Trump lacked the power to impose such tariffs on Canada.\n\nCorrection: February 20, 2026 — An earlier version of this story misspelled Hakeem Jeffries' name.",

    "title": "Here's Why You Should Never Use AI to Generate Your Passwords",
    "description": "ChatGPT isn't good at generating secure passwords.",
    "fullText": "I'm a bit of a broken record when it comes to personal security on the internet: Make strong passwords for each account; never reuse any passwords; and With these three steps combined, your general security is pretty much set. But how you make those passwords matters just as much as making each strong and unique. As such, please don't use an AI program to generate your passwords.\n\nIf you're a fan of chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini, it might seem like a no-brainer to ask the AI to generate passwords for you. You might like how they handle other tasks for you, so it might make sense that something seemingly so high-tech yet accessible could produce secure passwords for your accounts. But LLMs (large language models) are not necessarily good at everything, and creating good passwords just so happens to be among those faults.\n\nAs highlighted by Malwarebytes Labs, researchers recently investigated AI-generated passwords, and evaluated their security. In short? The findings aren't good. Researchers tested password generation across ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, and discovered that the passwords were \"highly predictable\" and \"not truly random.\" Claude, in particular, didn't fare well: Out of 50 prompts, the bot was only able to generate 23 unique passwords. Claude gave the same password as an answer 10 times. The Register reports that researchers found similar flaws with AI systems like GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 3 Pro, and even Nano Banana Pro. (Gemini 3 Pro even warned the passwords shouldn't be used for \"sensitive accounts.\")\n\nThe thing is, these results seem good on the surface. They look uncrackable because they're a mix of numbers, letters, and special characters, and password strength identifiers might say they're secure. But these generations are inherently flawed, whether that's because they are repeated results, or come with a recognizable pattern. Researchers evaluated the \"entropy\" of these passwords, or the measure of unpredictability, with both \"character statistics\" and \"log probabilities.\" If that all sounds technical, the important thing to note is that the results showed entropies of 27 bits and 20 bits, respectively. Character statistics tests look for entropy of 98 bits, while log probabilities estimates look for 120 bits. You don't need to be an expert in password entropy to know that's a massive gap.\n\nHackers can use these limitations to their advantage. Bad actors can run the same prompts as researchers (or, presumably, end users) and collect the results into a bank of common passwords. If chatbots repeat passwords in their generations, it stands to reason that many people might be using the same passwords generated by those chatbots—or trying passwords that follow the same pattern. If so, hackers could simply try those passwords during break-in attempts, and if you used an LLM to generate your password, it might match. It's tough to say what that exact risk is, but to be truly secure, each of your passwords should be totally unique. Potentially using a password that hackers have in a word bank is an unnecessary risk.\n\nIt might seem surprising that a chatbot wouldn't be good at generating random passwords, but it makes sense based on how they work. LLMs are trained to predict the next token, or data point, that should appear in a sequence. In this case, the LLM is trying to choose the characters that make the most sense to appear next, which is the opposite of \"random.\" If the LLM has passwords in its training data, it may incorporate that into its answer. The password it generates makes sense in its \"mind,\" because that's what it's been trained on. It isn't programmed to be random.\n\nMeanwhile, traditional password managers are not LLMs. Instead, they are designed to produce a truly random sequence, by taking cryptographic bits and converting them into characters. These outputs are not based on existing training data and follow no patterns, so the chances that someone else out there has the same password as you (or that hackers have it stored in a word bank) is slim. There are plenty of options out there to use, and most password managers come with secure password generators.\n\nBut you don't even need one of these programs to make a secure password. Just pick two or three \"uncommon\" words, mix a few of the characters up, and presto: You have a random, unique, and secure password. For example, you could take the words \"shall,\" \"murk,\" and \"tumble,\" and combine them into \"sH@_llMurktUmbl_e.\" (Don't use that one, since it's no longer unique.)\n\nIf you're looking to boost your personally security even further, consider passkeys whenever possible. Passkeys combine the convenience of passwords with the security of 2FA: With passkeys, your device is your password. You use its built-in authentication to log in (face scan, fingerprint, or PIN), which means there's no password to actually create. Without the trusted device, hackers won't be able to break into your account.\n\nNot all accounts support passkeys, which means they aren't a universal solution right now. You'll likely need passwords for some of your accounts, which means abiding by proper security methods to keep things in order. But replacing some of your passwords with passkeys can be a step up in both security and convenience—and avoids the security pitfalls of asking ChatGPT to make your passwords for you.",

It would've been very easy for me to blast off in front, but I wanted to get in among them and give him an idea of what a Flat race is like.\n\n\"For a big horse that's been jumping, he has a lot of speed and he's a joy to ride.\"\n\nHenderson, meanwhile, said the emphatic display under the Nottinghamshire course's floodlights would \"open up a lot of doors\".\n\n\"We've been through a few tears over the last year or so,\" he admitted. \"It's nice to be back with positive vibes.\n\n\"We've got lots to look forward to and lots of decisions to make. There are all sorts of options, including the Champion Hurdle.\"\n\nHe was swiftly made favourite with some bookmakers for this year's race, with The New Lion and Brighterdaysahead also well backed.\n\nBefore Friday's contest at Southwell, organisers had increased the prize money to £40,000, but a random ballot left Constitution Hill needing others to withdraw to get a run, with his participation only confirmed on Wednesday.\n\nConstitution Hill falls again as Golden Ace wins",

    "fullText": "Celtic interim chairman Brian Wilson has vowed to seek an end to \"this debilitating and unnecessary atmosphere of conflict\" after a fan protest during Thursday's Europa League game left the Scottish champions fearing disciplinary action.\n\nUefa's disciplinary body will review reports from officials at the game against Stuttgart before deciding what, if any, action will be taken after it was held up for more than three minutes when tennis balls were thrown on to the Celtic Park pitch.\n\nIt is the latest in a long line of protests this season as fans expressed disappointment at the club's board.\n\nMartin O'Neill's side lost the first leg of their knockout play-off 4-1.\n\nScotland set to lose second Champions League place\n\nCeltic's O'Neill seeks 'utopia' after Euro setback\n\nCeltic v Hibs, Bartley & Chermiti in focus\n\n\"Last night was deeply disappointing for the club in many respects,\" Wilson said. \"This started with an orchestrated disruption of the game, causing a delay to an important match.\n\n\"Over the past two weeks, I have met with a range of supporters' groups and individual supporters.\n\n\"I have met in good faith with representatives of the Green Brigade and was hopeful that progress could have been made; indeed this remains the case. I also met in good faith with representatives of the Celtic Fans Collective.\n\n\"When I came into this role, I asked for unity inside the stadium to support the team while trying to resolve other issues. I want to see suspensions lifted and differences set aside, but this cannot be unconditional.\"\n\nWilson had taken over as interim chairman after former chief executive Peter Lawwell stood down in December citing \"abuse and threats\".\n\nRelations appeared to be thawing in January when the Celtic Fans Collective praised Wilson's appeal for unity and appealed for common ground while again calling for changes to the club's hierarchy.\n\nThe latest tennis ball protest led to criticism from team boss O'Neill.\n\n\"Last night's disruption and the reasoning behind it illustrate the difficulty we face and have repeatedly had to contend with,\" Wilson added.\n\n\"This is not intended to deflect from other issues that affect the club and are fully recognised. However, the possibility of further disruptions needs to be addressed urgently.\n\n\"Surely the priority must be to give Martin and our players every opportunity to achieve their objectives within the remainder of the season.\n\n\"On that basis, I will continue to seek an end to this debilitating and unnecessary atmosphere of conflict.\"\n\nVisit our Celtic page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Celtic news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "fullText": "Milan-Cortina 2026 has been one of the most eventful Winter Olympics in history – in sporting and political terms - so it is appropriate that the final medal event could be the most enticing of all.\n\nCanada and United States have been the two best teams in the men's ice hockey competition, and they will duke it out at Milano Santagiulia Arena on Sunday at 13.10 GMT.\n\nFor two of the most storied nations in the sport, however, they have very different Olympic histories.\n\nCanada are aiming to be the first nation to earn 10 men's ice hockey gold medals, most recently winning the title in 2014.\n\nUSA meanwhile have not claimed the men's title since 1980 - the 'Miracle on Ice' triumph over Soviet Union in Lake Placid - and have not beaten Canada in a men's final since 1960.\n\nCanada have beaten the American men in their past two Olympic final meetings - Salt Lake City 2002 and Vancouver 2010. But the USA are looking for a double in Milan after their women's side defeated the Canadians on Thursday.\n\nThe two teams did not have a totally smooth skate to this point. Both needed overtime to win their quarter-finals, while Canada had to come from 2-0 down to beat Finland 3-2 in Friday's semi-final on Friday, scoring the winner with 35 seconds on the clock.\n\nThe Canadians also have fitness issues. They could be without captain Sidney Crosby, who was forced off in their last eight win over Czech Republic with a knee injury and missed the Finland semi. Canada are hopeful to have him for Sunday, but he certainly will not be 100% fit.\n\nThe squad has also been afflicted by a sickness bug, which dramatically revealed itself in the quarter-final when Nathan MacKinnon threw up while sat on the bench.\n\nBut even when impacted by injury and illness, Canada still have the strongest team.\n\n\"In Connor McDavid you have the best player on the planet by a million miles,\" ice hockey commentator Seth Bennett told BBC Sport. \"He was averaging three points a game going into semi-finals.\n\n\"McKinnon is another superstar offensive player. Defensively, Cale Makar is the best defenceman in the world and a gamechanger. All will be judged against him.\n\n\"You mix them up and it's like if you have a computer game and you put all the best players on one team.\"\n\nThey also have some of the best up-and-coming talents in the game, such as 19-year-old Macklin Celebrini who has already scored the most points by a teenager in an Olympic competition.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nUSA meanwhile have stars of their own, but don't have the attacking gifts of the Canadians.\n\n\"The Tkachuk brothers [Brady and Matthew], and Jack Eichel, that attacking line has worked well together,\" Bennett said.\n\n\"What they have not had is much scoring from captain Auston Matthews, he has not yet taken any of the games by the horns. They are OK, but not more than that.\"\n\nHowever, the Americans have the best defenceman at the Games in Quinn Hughes, who scored the crucial winner against Sweden.\n\n\"He might be the best three-on-three player in the world,\" said Bennett. \"He loves to keep possession, and is always looking to make an exciting play.\"\n\nIt sets up a mouth-watering finale of an Olympic ice hockey competition which has benefitted hugely from the return of National Hockey League (NHL) players for the first time since 2014.\n\nThe attendance of players from the top North American league was in doubt for a time over concerns about the ice quality at the unfinished Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena, but they have been a major boon for the Games.\n\n\"This is the highest level of hockey we have ever seen at an Olympics,\" said Bennett. \"The NHL players have made it a different world.\n\n\"At the last two Olympics, games have been good but have missed the quality in the final third, the big moments. Players didn't have the skillset to break a game, so saw a lot of tight, dull games\n\n\"Some of what the players have been doing here has been mind-blowing. One of the goals scored for Canada, McDavid saucered this pass from the back door [behind the goal], it lands as McKinnon is shooting, on the half-volley. That's when you recognise it.\n\n\"I have been getting phone calls from people in the hockey world, all they have been saying is, this is so good. There have been periods where Kent [Simpson, BBC co-commentator] and I have just been sat watching, smiling, laughing.\"\n\nCanada have won gold in three of the five Olympics when NHL players have featured and will fancy their chances in a game on Sunday which could be as fascinating in the stands as it is on the ice.\n\nIt is highly likely that Canadian prime minister Mark Carney will be in Milan for the game.\n\nNot only is Canada as a country hockey-mad, but so is Carney - when working as governor of the Bank of England, he would play for a recreational team in Haringey, north London.\n\nThe big question is whether his American counterpart will also be in Italy.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThe BBC understands that, as of Friday afternoon, Donald Trump is scheduled to remain in Washington DC - but that could now change.\n\nIt would be a logistical and security nightmare for the International Olympic Committee should he attend, and it would add a major frisson to an already charged game.\n\nTrump's vice president JD Vance attended a USA group stage game, and the Olympic opening ceremony at San Siro where he was loudly booed when he appeared on the stadium's big screen.\n\nAnd the presence of Trump - who previously said he will impose tariffs on imported goods from Canada, while also floating the idea of their northern neighbours becoming the US's 51st state - would turn the Santagiulia Arena into a political cauldron.\n\nHis impact was seen in February 2025, when the Four Nations match between the United States and Canada descended into chaos with three fights breaking out between players in the first nine seconds.\n\nThe crowd at Montreal's Bell Centre for that game loudly booed the US national anthem pre-game - an issue which will be avoided in Milan. What happens after the game depends on the victor.\n\nAnd Bennett thinks the heightened stakes and occasion will mean a less pugilistic occasion.\n\n\"There won't be a repeat of the fights with a gold medal on the line,\" he said. \"They will be at each other though; in every break in play, there will be a cross-check, a word, a push, a scrum.\n\n\"Then when they fly back, they will fly on the same private jets because the NHL will put on transport.\n\n\"For example, you have Matthew Tkachuk for USA and Brad Marchand for Canada, who are both rink rats, they will go head-to-head 100%. Then they will be on the same flight, they are Florida Panthers teammates and will try to win the Stanley Cup together.\"\n\nThe crowd may also be less tense due to the likelihood of more neutrals buying tickets for an Olympic spectacle, rather than a potential grudge match.\n\nSo, if you are a neutral going to the game, who does Seth think you should support?\n\n\"Canada going for their 10th gold, so usually the neutral will go with the underdog,\" he says. \"But that is USA.\n\n\"Canada are a bit arrogant too, but they have all the favourite players. How do you not love a team with all those players?\n\n\"But how do you not love a USA team who are having this much fun?\"",

    "fullText": "Great Britain has fallen 25 years behind the best short track nations in the world amid outdated facilities and rising costs, according to British Ice Skating's head of performance.\n\nTeam GB's only short track representative at Milan-Cortina 2026, Niall Treacy, crashed in all three events - 500m, 1,000m and 1500m.\n\nThe 25-year-old reached the final of the 1500m, finishing ninth. But he was the only Brit to compete, with Team GB unable to fill their quota of three athletes.\n\nIt is a far cry from eight years ago, when a well-funded team of five were sent to PyeongChang 2018 with realistic medal hopes.\n\nBut a failure to get on the podium in Korea saw the sport's funding slashed, and head of performance Jon Eley says they have been rebuilding ever since.\n\nFormer short track skater Eley – who represented Britain in three Olympics between 2006 and 2014 – told BBC Sport: \"Go back to PyeongChang, where short track was funded well and we had a world champion [Elise Christie] in the team. That was a Games when we were disappointed not to win a medal.\n\n\"Since then, we have been rebuilding. During that time many teams have gone to the next level of performance and resources.\n\n\"When I made the team 25 years ago and we moved to Nottingham, we had one of the best facilities in the world; now, we don't have an international standard arena. We have a lot of work to do.\"\n\nBefore the 2018 Games, UK Sport provided £4.8m to short track skating. As of 2026, the latest UK Sport funding allocation of just under £2m has been presented as a total for short track, figure and long track speed skating.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nBritain has no international quality rinks to host short track events – such as an arena with soft padding around the barriers in case of crashes - meaning Treacy trained with the Dutch national team ahead of the Olympics.\n\nAnd Eley says there are no plans to improve facilities, due to a lack of funding as well as the greater popularity of other winter sports.\n\n\"If you do that [install padding] you can't have hockey on the rink, you can't have pucks with the pads, so you are cutting the use of the facility,\" he said. \"Ice hockey is a big participation sport in the UK.\n\n\"We had that in the lead up to PyeongChang, a hybrid system – pads in place during the week then they take them out on the weekend when the hockey team played.\n\n\"But it was costing £30,000 a week because of how much work it took to take the barriers in and out.\n\n\"Plus, the cost of running rinks in the last few years has gone through the roof, the cost of freezing the ice and the price of energy.\"\n\nInstead, short track will have to be clever with their funding and facilities – and Eley says they could look to a sport where Britain have had Olympic success.\n\nTwo of Britain's three golds at Milan-Cortina have been in skeleton, despite training on a single track in Bath with no ice.\n\nHowever, a clear talent ID and training programme brought success, followed by funding to allow for greater strides to be made in design and hiring world-class coaches.\n\n\"From a skeleton perspective, they might not have loads of access to tracks, but what they do, they do very well,\" he said. \"So we can learn from them.\"\n\nShort track is currently funded as a development sport, and Eley says they are looking to have a stronger and larger team for French Alps 2030.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "Britain's Conor Benn leaves Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Boxing organisation to join Dana White's Zuffa Boxing promotional company.",
    "fullText": "Britain's Conor Benn has left Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Boxing organisation to join Dana White's Zuffa Boxing promotional company.\n\nThe 29-year-old had been with Matchroom since turning professional and beat long-time rival Chris Eubank Jr in a blockbuster rematch at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in November, having lost their first bout in April.\n\nIn a statement on Instagram, Benn said he was \"filled with excitement and hunger for what's ahead with Zuffa Boxing\" while paying tribute to his former promoters.\n\n\"First and foremost I want to thank Eddie and the entire team at Matchroom for everything they have done for me over the past decade,\" wrote Benn, the son of former two-weight world champion Nigel.\n\n\"From guiding me when I first turned pro, to headlining stadium shows. They were not only with me for those highlight moments but stood shoulder to shoulder with me during the tough times.\"\n\nBenn and Eubank Jr were originally set to fight in 2022 but the bout was called off when Benn failed a voluntary drugs test - twice testing positive for the banned substance Clomifene.\n\nThat sparked a two-year battle with authorities, before Benn's suspension was lifted in November 2024.\n\nBenn has won 24 of his 25 professional bouts, with his only loss coming against Eubank - whose father Chris Sr fought Nigel Benn twice in the early 1990s.\n\nVictory over Eubank Jr in November has left Conor Benn on the verge of challenging for a world title.\n\nZuffa Boxing, backed by UFC chief White and Saudi Arabian money, staged its first event in January and has vowed to transform professional boxing.\n\nWhite's ultimate aim is to sideline the four traditional sanctioning bodies - WBO, WBC, IBF and WBA - and make Zuffa's belt the premier world title alongside the Ring Magazine title, an organisation owned by Saudi boxing powerbroker Turki Alalshikh.\n\n\"Conor Benn is an absolute beast and a superstar,\" said White. \"He shows up every time and destroys people, and now some of the best fighters in the world are calling him out.\n\n\"He's ready for a world title next and I can't wait to see him compete in Zuffa Boxing. He's going to be a huge addition to a growing stable of very talented boxers.\"\n\nBenn said he hoped Hearn could still be involved in future fights, adding: \"I want the legacy fights, the biggest nights, the biggest stages. I fear no man at any weight and I'm ready to give the fans the fights they've been calling for.\"\n\nAbsolutely nobody in boxing had this on their bingo card. There were no whispers, rumours or cryptic social media hints.\n\nUsually when a fighter jumps ship, the outgoing promoter gets ahead of it with a statement or some kind of warning shot - not this time.\n\nWhite has made no secret of his desire to disrupt boxing's power structure, and securing Benn - a fighter with genuine mainstream appeal, albeit still with doubters - is a statement signing.\n\nHearn had stood firmly behind Benn throughout the doping saga and was actively manoeuvring him towards a world-title shot. Benn is the mandatory challenger for the winner of Mario Barrios v Ryan Garcia, and has made no secret of his ambition to become a world champion.\n\nSo what does this mean for those plans? Zuffa recently signed reigning cruiserweight world champion Jai Opetaia, yet the long-term vision is one belt, a Zuffa title, and no reliance on the traditional sanctioning bodies.\n\nIf that is the direction, what does Benn do now? Will he target becoming the first Zuffa welterweight champion?\n\nOver the past week, White dismissed Hearn's credentials and quipped he works for his father Barry - prompting the younger Hearn to fire back that White's boss is Alalshikh.\n\nFrom a pure PR standpoint, this is a major win for White. This brewing promotional rivalry just got a whole lot louder.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

First and foremost, getting over injuries with a long time left in the game, was a challenge we had to get over pretty quickly.\n\n\"The players had to not let that derail what we are about and how we had prepared and planned and that we still had that belief, with people out of position, that we could hold tight, stay resilient and get the outcome we wanted.\n\n\"It's a long list of injuries and Jonny [Lomax] and Nene [Macdonald] going off so early in the game had a direct impact on the fluidity of what we wanted to do, offensively.\n\n\"As always, you learn more about people in adversity, so buckle up and we'll see where we get. Mid-season we'll have an influx of top-line players coming back.\n\n\"Jonny has a fractured arm, to be confirmed and Nene took a bang to his leg so we expect more investigation on that over the weekend or early next week.\"\n\n\"Leigh coach Adrian Lam told BBC Radio Manchester:\n\n\"We had the game won in the first half. The Leigh team of last year would have taken advantage of that and gone on with the job in the second half, but it wasn't to be.\n\n\"We were our own worst enemy, with so many mistakes and put ourselves under pressure against a St Helens team who were very enthusiastic.\n\n\"In the second half the wind was quite strong, we scored the try to go up eight points right at the end of the first half and they kicked off and got the ball back.\n\n\"That was a massive play in the game - if we go in at half-time up by eight it's a completely different ball game, but they're the little things we've just got to get through at this point.\n\n\"It's difficult to point the finger. We've got a lot of new faces and it's going to take some time.\"\n\nSt Helens: Sailor; Feldt, Macdonald, Cross, Murphy; Lomax, Hastings; Klemmer, Clark, Walmsley, Sironen, Wright, Shorrocks.\n\nInterchanges: Robertson, Host, Delaney, Whitley\n\nLeigh: Hodgson; Senior, Niu, Brand, Charnley; Cook, Lam; Trout, Ipape, Mulhern, Badrock, Alick-Wienke, Ofahengaue.\n\nInterchanges: Hughes, Liu, Davis, Horne",

    "description": "Sheffield Wednesday are on the brink of becoming the first team in English Football League history to be relegated in February.",
    "fullText": "Barring a highly unlikely series of results, administration-hit Sheffield Wednesday will become the first team in English Football League history to be relegated in February at some point in the next week.\n\nThe foundations for this relegation were set last summer when former owner Dejphon Chansiri's chaotic tenure came to a head with numerous missed wage payments.\n\nA large number of the senior squad and manager Danny Rohl left in the summer before the Owls were eventually placed into administration in October.\n\nTwo separate points deductions - totalling 18 points - followed, and it has always been a case of when, not if they went down from the Championship this season.\n\nA preferred bidder for the club was selected in December but the Owls remain in administration and are operating under tight restrictions, leaving them with a threadbare squad ill-equipped to compete at this level.\n\nHowever, few would have thought relegation could come quite as early as this and, to make matters worse, it could in fact now be confirmed at bitter cross-city rivals Sheffield United on Sunday.\n\nIf Sheffield Wednesday win all of their remaining 14 games of the season, they will finish the campaign on 35 points.\n\nFollowing Blackburn's win against Preston on Friday, the Owls will be relegated on Saturday if West Bromwich Albion beat leaders Coventry.\n\nA draw or a Coventry win would mean that Wednesday, who are still on -7 points, must then win at Bramall Lane to stop the 'R' from being placed next to their name this weekend.\n\nWinning a derby away from home is a tall task at the best of times, but when you consider that Wednesday's only win all season came at Portsmouth in September, they have lost their past nine games in the Championship, and have not so much as scored in the past six Steel City derbies, you get some idea of what Henrik Pedersen's beleaguered men are up against.\n\n\"We will do everything to bring a top, top performance to compete with them,\" Pederson told BBC Radio Sheffield. .\n\n\"Of course, we know it will happen some day.\n\n\"Nobody understands what this group has been through in the past many months.\n\n\"I have a group with a big belief and big motivation, and a group of senior players who are ready to do everything for our fans and stand up and perform.\n\n\"They know that 95% will not be enough.\"\n\nThe 18 points Sheffield Wednesday have been deducted are the third highest in a single Football League season.\n\nDerby County were deducted 21 in the 2021-22 campaign but took their fight for Championship survival through to April, while Luton Town were hit with a 30-point penalty in the 2008-09 season but finished on a creditable 26 points as they dropped out of League Two and also won the Football League Trophy.\n\nWith 14 games to go, Wednesday are also in danger of setting several more unwanted EFL records, including:\n\nNo team has ever ended a season on minus points. The Owls, who have won 11 points from 32 games so far, need seven from 14 matches to avoid this.\n\nAllowing for three points a game, the fewest points a team has ever picked up in a Football League season is Loughborough with nine in 1899-1900. In more recent times, Derby County went down from the Premier League with 11 points in the 2007-08 season. The all-time low for a 46-game season is Doncaster Rovers' 20 points in 1997-98.\n\nThe record for the most defeats in a 46-game league season also belongs to Doncaster with 34 in the 1997-98 campaign. Wednesday have lost 23 of their first 32 games, meaning 12 defeats in their remaining 14 matches would see them break that record.\n\nThe most consecutive defeats suffered by a team in one season was by Darwen way back in the 1898-99 season with 18. Since the second tier was rebranded as the Championship, the record for the most successive defeats is Rotherham's 10 in the 2016-17 season. Pedersen's side have lost their past nine games.\n\nIn a 46-game season, the fewest wins a team has ever managed is Rochdale's two as they were relegated from the third tier in 1973-74.\n\nWednesday's only win this season came away from home, meaning the Owls are now just six games from becoming the first Football League team to go an entire season without a home win.\n\nThe farthest adrift a team has finished is Stoke City in the 1984-85 season. They finished 33 points from safety in the top tier. At present, the Owls are 41 points behind 21st-placed West Brom.\n\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder has said the prospect of relegating their cross-city rivals is \"not in his thought process at all\".\n\nThe Blades fan, who is unbeaten in his seven games against the Owls, said he disagreed with the notion that his side, who are 15th in the table, should cruise to a win.\n\n\"We'll have done more preparation on this game than we have on any game this season and all the games other than the play-off final last season,\" he told BBC Radio Sheffield.\n\n\"I've got complete respect for Henrik and a group of players... there's talk of it being a mismatch or a gimme, whether it's bookies' odds or the narrative in the city... football just doesn't work like that.\n\n\"The players have to play with a discipline and a control to win a game of football, to win a local derby.\"\n\nWilder added: \"We put a slide up about Macclesfield v Crystal Palace and Bodo/Glimt v Manchester City. There are all sorts of examples recently, let alone [in] the 100 years plus of football, the game isn't decided on team sheets.\n\n\"We understand it's basically their season on the line, we're not daft. But we've got our fight, and ours has to be bigger than theirs.\"\n\nLatest Sheffield Wednesday news, analysis and fan views\n\nListen to Sheffield Wednesday content on BBC Sounds",

    "description": "Preparation, training, and belief - after Keely Hodgkinson smashes the indoor 800m world record, her coach Jenny Meadows explains how their plan came together.",
    "fullText": "Keely Hodgkinson had been preparing for this moment for years.\n\nWhen she stepped on to the indoor track in France on Thursday, the Briton and her team \"had no doubt\" she was going to break the 800m indoor world record - and she did so in some style.\n\nBut it has not all been plain sailing for Hodgkinson since she won the Olympic 800m title at Paris 2024.\n\nThe 23-year-old suffered injury issues last year which challenged her physically and mentally - but has used those setbacks to return even stronger, with her training group, the M11 Track Club, dubbing her 'Keely 2.0'.\n\nShe proved she is back to her best with her stunning indoor run in Lievin, crossing the line in one minute 54.87 seconds to smash a world record which had stood since 3 March 2002 - the day Hodgkinson was born.\n\nAnd this is how Hodgkinson etched her name in the history books.\n\nSince 2019, Hodgkinson has trained with coaches Trevor Painter and Jenny Meadows in Manchester.\n\nMeadows, a former international runner, was in France to watch her protege take almost a second off the 800m indoor record, set by Slovenia's Jolanda Ceplak almost 24 years ago.\n\n\"She actually said to me the day before: 'obviously I know I'm going to get it',\" said Meadows.\n\n\"There had been so many benchmarks we measure in training, we had no doubt that she would do it.\n\n\"Her biggest fear was to set a world record, but be disappointed with the time. She said 'what if I can't smile? What if I've got the world record, and everyone's so excited, and I think, oh that was rubbish. I could have gone faster'?\"\n\nThe date - 19 February 2026 - had long been set in the diary by Meadows and Hodgkinson given the track in Lievin is notoriously fast.\n\n\"Lievin has had a lot of world records over the years, and we kind of thought 'you know what, let's go with the statistics',\" Meadows said.\n\n\"We're only probably going to get one opportunity during this indoor season to go for it. So that's the event that we picked, and that's the date we've really had etched in our minds the last three months.\"\n\n\"I've got to say, the time she did was the bare minimum of what she was happy with,\" Meadows added.\n\n\"She definitely would have liked to run faster, and there was definitely half a second, maybe even up to one second in those legs.\"\n\nMeadows retired from the sport in 2016. As a former world and European medallist over 800m, she knew exactly what was required to make history.\n\n\"800m is so tough, your body is literally breaking down from the training,\" she said.\n\n\"Keely can be doing certain repetitions, and she's being physically sick from the lactic acid. It's a little bit inhumane at times.\"\n\nIn the build-up to Thursday's race, Meadows said the team learned lessons from previous years, and resisted the urge to do too much training with Hodgkinson - instead believing in the process and their athlete.\n\n\"Keely is a really interesting character. I was quite robotic and could follow a routine. Keely keeps us on our toes. We have to keep her interested. So we're always trying to do little different goals for her.\"\n\nMeadows added: \"We've not been greedy, we've really held back and said we need to believe in our process. We need to believe in our product. We need to believe in our athlete, that Keely can stand on that start line and deliver when the eyes of the world are on her.\"\n\nNine months ago the success experienced in Lievin would have felt like a distant dream for Hodgkinson.\n\nShe had planned a tilt at the 800m indoor world record at her eponymous Keely Klassic event in February 2025 and \"was in great shape\", according to Meadows.\n\nHowever, a hamstring problem forced Hodgkinson to withdraw, regroup and retrain - only for the injury to reoccur 12 weeks later.\n\nDespite setbacks and a reduction in training, she made it to the start line for September's World Athletics Championships, claiming bronze behind GB team-mate Georgia Hunter Bell and winner Kenya's Lilian Odira.\n\n\"It was phenomenal, given the very little preparation [Hodgkinson] did but I doubt she's ever looked at that medal again. She wants the gold, she wants the records, and that is what was driving her forward,\" said Meadows.\n\n\"She isn't the most talented athlete I have ever seen. The difference between Keely and a lot of others is mindset, she can get the best out of herself on a daily basis.\"\n\nIn under a month Hodgkinson will head to Poland to compete in the World Athletics Indoor Championships as a firm favourite for gold.\n\nBeyond that there is another target in her sights - the world record that has stood longer than any other in athletics.\n\nIn July 1983, Czech athlete Jarmila Kratochvilova set a women's outdoor 800m world record in a time of 1:53.28.\n\nBut 43 years on, Hodgkinson wants to beat that mark and make more history.\n\n\"She wants that more than the indoor record. Her ambition is to be a legend of the sport,\" said Meadows.\n\nKratochvilova's time remains more than a second quicker than Hodgkinson's current personal best of 1:54.61, a national record she set in London in 2024.\n\nHer coach believes London could be the scene of what would be arguably Hodgkinson's greatest achievement.\n\n\"I think she would like to do it in the UK. London always delivers a great crowd, a great occasion. In 2026 I think she can definitely run under 1:54...\n\n\"If she goes in on interrupted training, she really does stand a chance.\"",

    "description": "\"Wonderfully different\" Henry Pollock will start his first England Test in Saturday's must-win Six Nations game against Ireland.",
    "fullText": "Henry Pollock has never been short on confidence. He also knows how to leave an impression.\n\nEngland head coach Steve Borthwick speaks to Rugby Football Union director of performance Conor O'Shea \"four or five times a week\" about talent coming through the system.\n\nA blond-haired schoolboy flanker sprinting from his own 22 to score a solo try, external for Northampton Saints Under-18s will not go unmissed.\n\nHowever, it was a colourful post-match interview that first brought Pollock's personality to screens, as the youngster chose not to hold back after England Under-18s were beaten by South Africa in 2022.\n\nPollock's potty mouth was different and unexpected. The talent was always undeniable, but the personality drew attention.\n\nWhen visiting some of Northampton's England players, Borthwick was told to meet the then teenager, who was not long out of school.\n\n\"Normally, when an 18-year-old meets the England head coach for the first time and you don't know each other at all, they are reasonably shy and reserved at that point in time. He was the complete opposite,\" Borthwick told BBC Rugby Union Weekly.\n\n\"He bounded up to me and introduced himself, and I think his words were 'how are you, mate?' I thought 'this guy is wonderfully different, he is an incredible character, full of confidence'.\"\n\nAfter a meteoric rise, Saturday's match against Ireland - which England likely need to win to keep their Six Nations title hopes alive - will be Pollock's first Test start.\n\nDespite it being England captain Maro Itoje's 100th cap, many headlines have been around the inclusion of the 21-year-old tyro, who played for the British and Irish Lions last year after an extraordinary breakthrough season.\n\nSaturday 21 February at 14:10 GMT\n\nListen to live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds with live text updates on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nSuch has been Pollock's impact that already children at rugby clubs across England have been spotted running around with black head tape on, scoring tries and imitating his pulse-checking celebration.\n\nNorthampton's club shop does a roaring trade in sales of black head tape, which Pollock wears to protect his ears.\n\nBut his influence goes further than that.\n\nFormer Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll came home from covering last Saturday's game against Italy in Dublin to find his son dressed as Pollock.\n\nBordeaux Begles players mocked Pollock, who ended up in a final-whistle scuffle, in their post-match celebrations after winning last season's Champions Cup final.\n\n\"Pollock is an outstanding rugby player and I think he is brilliant for the game,\" former Scotland scrum-half Andy Nicol told Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"My daughters are 25 and 22 and they don't know who Tom Curry or Ben Earl are. They know who Henry Pollock is.\"\n\nIn less than six months, he went from being an England Under-20 player to playing for the British and Irish Lions.\n\n\"He is a great character and I got on well with him on the Lions tour in a weird kind of way,\" said assistant coach Johnny Sexton, who received a tongue-in-cheek 40th birthday message on tour off Pollock.\n\nA number of solo tries - one which cut open Leinster in a Champions Cup semi-final win and a remarkable chip-and-chase against Sale Sharks - showed Pollock has the speed and finishing prowess of a Test winger.\n\nThat ability to turn a game on its head, with a moment of magic, was missing for England in their defeat by Scotland last weekend.\n\nFormer Ireland wing Shane Horgan added on BBC 5 Live: \"He does things that few others can, I wouldn't be surprised if there's a spectacular moment by him [against Ireland] that galvanises England's performance.\n\n\"You've got an extremely highly skilled, massively talented individual who has enormous self-confidence, and that confidence has not been blunted by anything yet.\n\n\"That is when you get those generational players. They have all the components but also this bullet-proof confidence, which means they can just keep on delivering throughout their career.\"\n\nWhy Pollock may be England's next breakthrough star\n\nFive moments that made England centurion Itoje\n\n'Ireland plot upset with title hopes on the line'\n\nBorthwick has leaned into Pollock's energy, deploying him as an impact replacement for all seven of his England caps.\n\nFormer Ireland scrum-half Conor Murray played against Pollock in Europe last season and could not believe he has yet to start for England.\n\n\"He has been ripping it up for so long,\" Murray told BBC Rugby Union Weekly. \"He is perceived very well in my book.\n\n\"It was something very different when he came on the scene - too loud and brash - but what makes that OK in my sporting world is that he backs it up all the time.\n\n\"People talk about Pollock being so good off the bench with his dynamism, power and energy.\n\n\"Watch him for Northampton - he goes from the first minute to the 80th minute and does not look tired. I think he is a real danger.\"\n\nPollock, who can play across the back row, also enjoys playing on the edge, adding that he plays best when \"aggressive and confrontational\".\n\nHis love-hate relationship with fans in France continued this season in Bordeaux as he was booed in the Champions Cup final rematch, where he scored twice in defeat.\n\n\"Nobody boos rubbish players, nobody boos somebody they don't actually respect,\" Northampton boss Phil Dowson said.\n\nImpressive performances off the bench against Scotland and Wales have earned him a start at number eight, a position where he has scored six tries in his past five starts for Saints.\n\nFlanker Tom Curry, who started all three Lions Tests, has recently been used as a replacement in a back-row combination with Pollock.\n\nGetting one of England's big-game players on from the start would also have helped pave the way for Pollock, with Ben Earl's speed at open-side flanker also useful in trying to out-run Ireland.\n\n\"Henry Pollock is always tremendously excited. That is his general state. He lives at a level of excitement,\" Borthwick added.\n\n\"The supporters see the joy he plays the game with and they are excited by him.\"\n\nThe last time Pollock faced Irish opposition he played the entire 80 minutes and delivered a performance that accelerated his career and profile.\n\nA similar performance on Saturday may do the same, but this time as a Test starter.\n\nSix Nations: All about Ireland with Conor Murray",

    "title": "Who are the winners and losers from F1 pre-season testing?",
    "description": "As pre-season testing reaches its conclusion, which teams look best - and worst - placed ahead of the Australian Grand Prix?",
    "fullText": "The final pre-season test confirmed there will be a new Formula 1 when the 2026 season starts in Australia in two weeks' time.\n\nNew in the sense of who is at the front - and new in terms of many aspects of the sport and how it works.\n\nSo what did the last three days of running in Bahrain, before the teams decamp to Albert Park in Melbourne, say about the reshaped sport - and who are the winners and losers within that?\n\nFerrari's Charles Leclerc ended the test with the single fastest lap time in an emphatic way - 0.811 seconds quicker than the next best time, set by Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli.\n\nHeadline times in testing are usually not the place to look to gauge the competitive order, but this did reflect the picture in one important way - Mercedes and Ferrari look like they are going into the new season in the best shape.\n\nAndrea Stella, team principal of world champions McLaren, said on Friday evening: \"This test has confirmed that Ferrari and Mercedes look like the teams to beat. McLaren and Red Bull [are] probably very similar, Ferrari and Mercedes a step ahead.\"\n\nThis picture, an impression reflected by many other senior figures up and down the pit lane, comes less from the headline lap times - even if they did show the teams in the order Ferrari, Mercedes, McLaren, Red Bull - than the so-called race-simulation runs.\n\nBecause the teams fill up their cars with fuel and run a grand prix distance, these have far fewer variables to muddy the picture than single laps.\n\nOn Friday evening, Leclerc did the best race simulation of the week, slightly quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen and McLaren's Oscar Piastri the day before, when they set more or less exactly the same time.\n\nMercedes did not do any race simulations in the second week, only in the first, when track conditions were up to a second slower.\n\nAntonelli set comfortably the fastest race simulation of the first week - a lot faster than Piastri, who was running at the same time.\n\nAnd his team-mate George Russell - the bookies' pre-season championship favourite - was also impressively quick when running in the hotter, slower conditions earlier in the day.\n\nThis is not an exact science, but the cumulation of data is what led to the conclusion reached by Stella and many others.\n\nA complication was that McLaren were not running the latest specification of Mercedes power-unit, which Mercedes were proving out, so can expect an uplift when they switch in Australia to the latest spec.\n\nAnother is Red Bull's new engine is said by Russell to have the best deployment of energy, which is such an important facet this season.\n\nMercedes' biggest concern is reliability. This hit Antonelli much more than Russell, but it's probably fair to say that Mercedes suffered more problems than their major rivals, although Red Bull's new recruit Isack Hadjar did lose a fair bit of his running to issues of one kind or another.\n\nRelive final day of pre-season testing as Ferrari's Leclerc fastest in Bahrain\n\n'Keep calm,' says Domenicali on criticism of new F1 rules\n\nNorris admits new F1 cars 'not purest form of racing'\n\nThere is no question as to the prize for biggest disappointment so far this year. Aston Martin, starting their new works partnership with Honda, are runaway winners of that.\n\nWith design legend Adrian Newey at the helm, Honda - world champions with Red Bull as recently as 2024 - and the money of their billionaire owner Lawrence Stroll and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), all the ingredients for success seem to be there.\n\nBut the new car, delayed by the fact Newey did not arrive until March last year, is uncompetitive and difficult, and the engine is lacking power and unreliable. Aston Martin completed the fewest laps of testing, and look like they may even be in worse shape than new team Cadillac, who expected to be last this year.\n\nBoth the internal combustion engine and hybrid elements of the new Honda power-unit are said to be well behind the best.\n\nSeveral sources told BBC Sport this week that Newey said at Wednesday's meeting of the F1 Commission - a rule-making body comprising all the teams as well as F1 and the FIA - that the Honda power-unit could not even recover energy at the lower limit of 250kw, let alone the higher one of 350kw, which comes into force under certain circumstances in the highly complex rules.\n\nReliability was so bad that by the start of the final day of the test, Honda had only one battery left, and took the decision to limit running to only short runs. A statement said that was to allow them to study data in between track outings, but in the end Lance Stroll did only six laps all day.\n\nThe problems with the engine make it difficult to make any judgement on the car. There is no question it was slow in the corners - but the Honda is running so badly that it's hard for the team to work out where the car is, and therefore how to improve it.\n\nThis is exacerbated by the fact Aston's first in-house gearbox - they have bought them in previously - is not communicating with the engine properly, and keeps behaving oddly, making life even more difficult for the drivers.\n\nFor Fernando Alonso, this all must come with an agonising sense of deja vu. He spent three painful years at McLaren when Honda were underprepared when they re-entered F1 in 2015.\n\nAnd now he faces another one, at the age of 44, and with his contract running out at the end of the year.\n\nPublicly, Alonso is staying optimistic as he said: \"Short and medium term, I don't think there is anything that is impossible to fix.\"\n\nHow long it takes, though, is another matter. And one thing Alonso does not have much of is time.\n\nWhile all the teams are reluctant to say exactly where they think they stand in the competitive order, all are clear that there appears to be three groups of teams - the top four, the midfield, and then Aston Martin and Cadillac at the back.\n\nAmong the midfield runners, who are in the region of at least a second a lap slower than the big four, the team poised to make the biggest step seem to be Alpine.\n\nThey finished last season last, by the biggest margin ever, partly because they devoted extremely limited resource to last year's car, so they could focus on this year.\n\nAlpine have switched to a Mercedes power-unit, following parent company Renault's decision to end its F1 engine programme. And with the combination of this and a much-improved car appear to have jumped up to the top of the midfield fight.\n\nThere is some debate as to whether they or Haas are in the best shape, but either way this is huge progress for the French team.\n\nRacing Bulls are also in this mix at the top of the midfield.\n\nAmong the midfield teams, Williams seem to be the biggest losers. Their 2026 car has been a disappointment so far, overweight by a significant margin - said to be anywhere between 25 and 40 kilos - and lacking downforce.\n\nWilliams finished fifth last year, and this season was supposed to be the next step in their ambition of a return to the top of F1.\n\nTeam principal James Vowles has been saying for two years how much of an opportunity the new rules are to move forward, and was vocal last season as to how early they had switched to the 2026 design and compromised 2025 for exactly this reason.\n\nAudi, which has taken over Sauber for the start of its brand new works programme with its own in-house engine, were expected to have difficulties.\n\nBut they appear to be in decent shape and have been quietly impressive in the midfield context, and could well be ahead of Williams, even if a long way from their ultimate ambitions.\n\nThe leading drivers have all at various points expressed their dissatisfaction with the new rules, especially the amount of energy management required with the new hybrid power-units.\n\nThese feature a near 50-50 split between internal combustion engine and electrical components.\n\nWith the amount of hybrid power increased three-fold, a component of the engine that helped recovery energy removed, and the batteries more or less the same size as last year, the cars are energy starved.\n\nThis has led to some unusual aspects being added to driving.\n\nThese include not going flat out in the run up to the start of a qualifying lap, taking corners in higher gears than is optimum for lap time to keep the turbo spinning, lifting and coasting in qualifying, and even not going flat out at the end of a qualifying lap because it is more time-effective to use the energy elsewhere.\n\nAt some circuits, there will be a lot more energy recovery required than others by the various means available. These include recovering while at full throttle, known as \"super-clip\", and lifting and coasting, as well as the standard method, during braking.\n\nAlbert Park is one of these energy-poor circuits.\n\nFor a purist, and drivers who want to be on the limit at all times, this is not ideal.\n\nBut F1 as a sport has known this was coming ever since the power-unit regulations were created in 2022. And, for now, the drivers are going to have get used to a new normal.\n\nBehind the scenes, meanwhile, there are ongoing discussions as to how to allow the drivers to drive in a more conventional way, but it remains to be seen how these will resolve.\n\nHowever, having seen the cars on track, and watched them on television, it is highly unlikely the average viewer will notice any difference. They still look like F1 cars, and in some ways are more appealing than last year's.\n\nThey are smaller and have less downforce, so they slide \n\nRussell, while acknowledging the differences from previous cars, said: \"The guiding principles are still very much the same. You're pushing the car to the absolute limit. You're trying to brake as hard and late as possible, and carry as much speed through the corners. So far, I'm quite enjoying it.\"\n\nOff track, one of the main focuses of pre-season has been a row between the engine manufacturers over the rules governing the engines' compression ratio.\n\nIt split the engine suppliers into two groups, Mercedes versus the rest - Ferrari, Honda and newcomers Red Bull and Audi.\n\nThe row was dismissed earlier this week by Vowles - a Mercedes customer - as \"noise that will probably go away\", and by Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff as \"a storm in a teacup\".\n\nAnd it looks like both will end up being right.\n\nWhy have Mercedes been targeted? Because their rivals believe they have found a way of exploiting the rule restricting the compression ratio - a measurement of the cylinder displacement between the two extremes of the piston stroke - to 16:1. The rules dictate it is measured at ambient temperature.\n\nTypically, the compression ratio reduces when engines heat up, and the belief was Mercedes had found a way using materials technology to limit this loss.\n\nMercedes' rivals have been pushing for a rule that measures it at a higher temperature, in the hope of restricting their perceived advantage.\n\nThis could also have allowed the others to set their ambient temperature compression ratio higher than 16:1 so that it was at the limit at a higher temperature, and so improve the performance of their engines relative to Mercedes.\n\nGoverning body the FIA has proposed a compromise whereby the ratio is measured both at ambient temperature and 130C.\n\nAs this does not achieve the aim Mercedes' opponents wanted, the signs are the other companies may even vote against the proposal that came out of their own campaign. Even if it passes, it seems it will make no difference.\n\nWolff added: \"The way it works, you know, either we stay with the regulations like we are or the e-vote goes ahead with the proposal that came from the FIA. Both are OK for us.\"\n\nThe new engines are also much harder to get off the line, which many expect will lead to unpredictability at starts.\n\nThere were safety concerns about this at the start of the first test - especially the risk of a car slow away being rear-ended by another at high speed.\n\nBut these were largely assuaged by a new start line procedure that was trialled at the test, which gives the drivers more time to get the turbos spinning at the optimum speed.\n\nOn the face of it, the Ferrari-engined cars seemed to have an advantage - they rocketed past rivals on several occasions during these tests.\n\nBut Williams driver Alex Albon said: \"I don't think what you're seeing is really what's going to happen. You've got drivers who are finishing long runs, going into a practice start, on a high-mileage tyre that's already gone. So you've seen this chaos of some people getting good starts, bad starts, but actually it's not as bad as that.\"\n\nAnd data seen by BBC Sport showed that, actually, of all the starts performed in testing, the Mercedes-engined teams as a bloc had the best starts on average - they were ranked in four of the top five places - followed by Ferrari-powered cars.\n\nStrangely, Racing Bulls were second and Red Bull last, despite having the same Red Bull Powertrains/Ford engine.\n\nFerrari (Charles Leclerc) one minute 31.992 seconds\n\nMercedes (Kimi Antonelli) Mercedes 1:32.803\n\nMcLaren (Oscar Piastri) 1:32.861\n\nRed Bull (Max Verstappen) 1:33.109\n\nHaas (Oliver Bearman) Haas 1:33.487\n\nAudi (Gabriel Bortoleto) 1:33.755\n\nRacing Bulls (Arvid Lindblad) 1:34.149\n\nWilliams (Carlos Sainz) 1:34.342\n\nCadillac (Valtteri Bottas) 1:35.290\n\nAston Martin (Lance Stroll) 1:35.974",

    "description": "Cloudflare introduces Code Mode for Workers AI, a technical approach to fit entire API schemas into 1,000 tokens, enabling LLM agents to execute precise tool calls with minimal latency.",
    "fullText": "Model Context Protocol (MCP) has become the standard way for AI agents to use external tools. But there is a tension at its core: agents need many tools to do useful work, yet every tool added fills the model's context window, leaving less room for the actual task.\n\nCode Mode is a technique we first introduced for reducing context window usage during agent tool use. Instead of describing every operation as a separate tool, let the model write code against a typed SDK and execute the code safely in a Dynamic Worker Loader. The code acts as a compact plan. The model can explore tool operations, compose multiple calls, and return just the data it needs. Anthropic independently explored the same pattern in their Code Execution with MCP post.\n\nToday we are introducing a new MCP server for the entire Cloudflare API — from DNS and Zero Trust to Workers and R2 — that uses Code Mode. With just two tools, search() and execute(), the server is able to provide access to the entire Cloudflare API over MCP, while consuming only around 1,000 tokens. The footprint stays fixed, no matter how many API endpoints exist.\n\nFor a large API like the Cloudflare API, Code Mode reduces the number of input tokens used by 99.9%. An equivalent MCP server without Code Mode would consume 1.17 million tokens — more than the entire context window of the most advanced foundation models.\n\nCode mode savings vs native MCP, measured with tiktoken\n\nYou can start using this new Cloudflare MCP server today. And we are also open-sourcing a new Code Mode SDK in the Cloudflare Agents SDK, so you can use the same approach in your own MCP servers and AI Agents.\n\nThis new MCP server applies Code Mode server-side. Instead of thousands of tools, the server exports just two: search() and execute(). Both are powered by Code Mode. Here is the full tool surface area that gets loaded into the model context:\n\nTo discover what it can do, the agent calls search(). It writes JavaScript against a typed representation of the OpenAPI spec. The agent can filter endpoints by product, path, tags, or any other metadata and narrow thousands of endpoints to the handful it needs. The full OpenAPI spec never enters the model context. The agent only interacts with it through code.\n\nWhen the agent is ready to act, it calls execute(). The agent writes code that can make Cloudflare API requests, handle pagination, check responses, and chain operations together in a single execution.\n\nBoth tools run the generated code inside a Dynamic Worker isolate — a lightweight V8 sandbox with no file system, no environment variables to leak through prompt injection and external fetches disabled by default. Outbound requests can be explicitly controlled with outbound fetch handlers when needed.\n\nSuppose a user tells their agent: \"protect my origin from DDoS attacks.\" The agent's first step is to consult documentation. It might call the Cloudflare Docs MCP Server, use a Cloudflare Skill, or search the web directly. From the docs it learns: put Cloudflare WAF and DDoS protection rules in front of the origin.\n\nStep 1: Search for the right endpoints\nThe search tool gives the model a spec object: the full Cloudflare OpenAPI spec with all $refs pre-resolved. The model writes JavaScript against it. Here the agent looks for WAF and ruleset endpoints on a zone:\n\nThe server runs this code in a Workers isolate and returns:\n\nThe full Cloudflare API spec has over 2,500 endpoints. The model narrowed that to the WAF and ruleset endpoints it needs, without any of the spec entering the context window.\n\nThe model can also drill into a specific endpoint's schema before calling it. Here it inspects what phases are available on zone rulesets:\n\nThe agent now knows the exact phases it needs: ddos_l7 for DDoS protection and http_request_firewall_managed for WAF.\n\nStep 2: Act on the API\nThe agent switches to using execute. The sandbox gets a cloudflare.request() client that can make authenticated calls to the Cloudflare API. First the agent checks what rulesets already exist on the zone:\n\nThe agent sees that managed DDoS and WAF rulesets already exist. It can now chain calls to inspect their rules and update sensitivity levels in a single execution:\n\nThis entire operation, from searching the spec and inspecting a schema to listing rulesets and fetching DDoS and WAF configurations, took four tool calls.\n\nWe started with MCP servers for individual products. Want an agent that manages DNS? Add the DNS MCP server. Want Workers logs? Add the Workers Observability MCP server. Each server exported a fixed set of tools that mapped to API operations. This worked when the tool set was small, but the Cloudflare API has over 2,500 endpoints. No collection of hand-maintained servers could keep up.\n\nThe Cloudflare MCP server simplifies this. Two tools, roughly 1,000 tokens, and coverage of every endpoint in the API. When we add new products, the same search() and execute() code paths discover and call them — no new tool definitions, no new MCP servers. It even has support for the GraphQL Analytics API.\n\nOur MCP server is built on the latest MCP specifications. It is OAuth 2.1 compliant, using Workers OAuth Provider to downscope the token to selected permissions approved by the user when connecting. The agent  only gets the capabilities the user explicitly granted.\n\nFor developers, this means you can use a simple agent loop and still give your agent access to the full Cloudflare API with built-in progressive capability discovery.\n\nSeveral approaches have emerged to reduce how many tokens MCP tools consume:\n\nClient-side Code Mode was our first experiment. The model writes TypeScript against typed SDKs and runs it in a Dynamic Worker Loader on the client. The tradeoff is that it requires the agent to ship with secure sandbox access. Code Mode is implemented in Goose and Anthropics Claude SDK as Programmatic Tool Calling.\n\nCommand-line interfaces are another path. CLIs are self-documenting and reveal capabilities as the agent explores. Tools like OpenClaw and Moltworker convert MCP servers into CLIs using MCPorter to give agents progressive disclosure. The limitation is obvious: the agent needs a shell, which not every environment provides and which introduces a much broader attack surface than a sandboxed isolate.\n\nDynamic tool search, as used by Anthropic in Claude Code, surfaces a smaller set of tools hopefully relevant to the current task. It shrinks context use but now requires a search function that must be maintained and evaluated, and each matched tool still uses tokens.\n\nEach approach solves a real problem. But for MCP servers specifically, server-side Code Mode combines their strengths: fixed token cost regardless of API size, no modifications needed on the agent side, progressive discovery built in, and safe execution inside a sandboxed isolate. The agent just calls two tools with code. Everything else happens on the server.\n\nThe Cloudflare MCP server is available now. Point your MCP client at the server URL and you'll be redirected to Cloudflare to authorize and select the permissions to grant to your agent. Add this config to your MCP client:\n\nFor CI/CD, automation, or if you prefer managing tokens yourself, create a Cloudflare API token with the permissions you need. Both user tokens and account tokens are supported and can be passed as bearer tokens in the Authorization header.\n\nMore information on different MCP setup configurations can be found at the Cloudflare MCP repository.\n\nCode Mode solves context costs for a single API. But agents rarely talk to one service. A developer's agent might need the Cloudflare API alongside GitHub, a database, and an internal docs server. Each additional MCP server brings the same context window pressure we started with.\n\nCloudflare MCP Server Portals let you compose multiple MCP servers behind a single gateway with unified auth and access control. We are building a first-class Code Mode integration for all your MCP servers, and exposing them to agents with built-in progressive discovery and the same fixed-token footprint, regardless of how many services sit behind the gateway.",

    "description": "Preflight Checklist I have searched existing requests and this feature hasn't been requested yet This is a single feature request (not multiple features) Problem Statement When auto-compaction trig...",
    "fullText": "When auto-compaction triggers mid-task, the summarization process irreversibly loses user-provided data that Claude is actively working with. The compacted summary retains a reference to the data (e.g., \"user provided DOM markup\") but discards the data itself — even though the full transcript is still on disk at ~/.claude/projects/{project-path}/.\n\nConcrete example: I paste ~8,000 characters of DOM markup and ask Claude to refactor it. The session continues, auto-compaction fires, and the summary now says \"User provided 8,200 characters of DOM markup for analysis.\" When I ask a specific question about the markup, Claude either hallucinates details, hedges, or asks me to re-paste what I provided minutes ago. The transcript on disk still has the original markup — Claude just has no way to know that, or where to find it.\n\nThis isn't an edge case. Any task involving substantial user-provided input (DOM markup, config files, log output, schema definitions) is at risk the moment the context window fills up. There are at least 8 open issues describing different symptoms of this same root cause:\n\n#1534 — Memory Loss After Auto-compact (June 2025, closed — problem persists)\n\n#3021 — Forgets to Refresh Memory After Compaction\n\n#10960 — Repository Path Changes Forgotten After Compaction\n\n#13919 — Skills context completely lost after auto-compaction (compiled its own list of 5+ related issues)\n\n#14968 — Context compaction loses critical state\n\n#19888 — Conversation compaction loses entire history\n\n#21105 — Context truncation causes loss of conversation history\n\n#23620 — Agent team lost when lead's context gets compacted\n\nThe underlying problem: compaction is a one-way lossy transformation with an available lossless source that isn't wired up. The summary and the transcript coexist on disk, but the summary contains no pointer back to the source material it compressed.\n\nPhase 1: Within-session indexed transcript references\n\nTag compressed entries in the compacted summary with transcript line-range annotations so Claude can surgically recover only the specific content it needs, on demand.\n\nCurrent behavior (lossy, no recovery):\n\n[compacted] User provided 8,200 characters of DOM markup for analysis.\n\nProposed behavior (recoverable):\n\n[compacted] User provided 8,200 characters of DOM markup for analysis. [transcript:lines 847-1023]\n\nWhen Claude detects it needs the original data — because a question requires specifics the summary doesn't contain — it reads only lines 847–1023 from the transcript. Surgical recovery, minimal token cost, no wasted context on data that isn't needed.\n\nImplementation scope: A modification to the compaction summarizer — when compressing a block of content, emit the summary line plus a transcript line-range annotation. Then expose a recovery mechanism (likely a file read with offset) that Claude can invoke when it identifies a gap between what the summary references and what it can actually see.\n\nPhase 2 (future extension): Cross-session indexed lookup\n\nThe same mechanism generalizes across sessions. Transcripts from past sessions persist in ~/.claude/projects/. A cross-session reference would look like:\n\nSuggested UX: Claude checks the current session transcript first (fast, local, cheap). If no match, Claude prompts the user: \"I don't have that detail in the current session. Want me to search previous session transcripts?\" User opts in → Claude searches across session transcripts using indexed references. This respects the user's token budget while providing a clean escalation path.\n\nMEMORY.md behavioral nudge — Adding a rule in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md telling Claude to check the transcript when data feels incomplete. This works occasionally but depends on Claude being self-aware enough to recognize what it's lost, which it often can't. It's a behavioral hack, not an architectural fix.\n\nManual /compact with preservation instructions — e.g., /compact preserve all user-provided DOM markup. This is manual, not automated, and still produces lossy summaries.\n\nExisting proposals that address this differently:\n\n#17428 — File-backed summaries that write compacted content to new files for later retrieval. This proposal achieves the same goal with less machinery: the transcript already exists on disk, so rather than duplicating data into new files, annotate the summary with line-range pointers to the existing transcript. Same recoverability, zero additional storage.\n\n#15923 — Pre-compaction hook to archive transcripts before compaction. Useful for logging but doesn't solve the recovery problem — Claude still can't find what it lost.\n\n#21190 — Include last N interactions verbatim in the compact summary. Helps with recent context but doesn't scale to mid-session data and increases summary size.\n\n#6549 — Manual continuation prompts before compaction. Effective but entirely manual and user-dependent.\n\nCommunity workarounds: The MCP memory ecosystem (embedding stores, knowledge graphs, SQLite-backed recall) has dozens of projects working around this gap externally. These are all compensating for one missing capability: the compacted summary doesn't know where its source material lives. The indexed transcript reference approach solves it natively, at the platform layer, with zero additional infrastructure.\n\nHigh - Significant impact on productivity\n\nWith indexed transcript references:\n\nAt step 4, Claude sees [transcript:lines 847-1023] in the compacted summary, reads just those 177 lines from the transcript on disk, recovers the exact markup, and answers accurately. No re-paste, no guessing, no wasted tokens. The session continues as if compaction never happened.\n\nThe transcript already persists at ~/.claude/projects// — no new storage mechanism needed. This proposal adds metadata to the compaction summary, not infrastructure.\n\nImplementation scope is a modification to the compaction summarizer: emit summary lines with [transcript:lines X-Y] annotations, plus a recovery mechanism (file read with line offset) Claude can invoke on demand.\n\nToken cost is zero until recovery is triggered, and surgical when it is — only the specific compressed chunk gets loaded, not the full transcript.\n\nRelated issues (demand evidence):\n\nAt least 8 open bugs trace back to this same root cause — compaction summaries with no back-reference to source:\n\n#1534, #3021, #10960, #13919, #14968, #19888, #21105, #23620\n\nRelated feature requests (differentiation):\n\nPhase 2 extension (not the core ask, but worth noting): The same indexed mechanism generalizes across session transcripts for cross-session recovery. Default to current session lookup; prompt the user before searching prior sessions. Same architecture, wider scope.",

    "fullText": "It has long been the case that the person sitting next to you on an airplane may have paid a very different price for their seat than you did. For two reasons. First, airlines don’t price seats – they price itineraries. A seat from London to New York may be priced very differently depending on whether it’s one-way, one-half of a round trip, or one stage in a larger, multi-stage journey. Second, however, airlines are sophisticated about maximizing the value of your seat, responding to patterns of peak travel (Thanksgiving, August), when you buy it, and other factors. Despite their complexity, those prices are supposed to be based on published tariffs that anyone can, in theory, calculate for themselves and come up with the same answer.\n\nIn 2012, travel and data privacy expert Edward Hasbrouck explained all this as part of documenting and opposing the airlines’ desire to move to personalized pricing. Instead of acting as common carriers and publishing tariffs that apply across the board, with personalized pricing the airlines would use the information they have about you to charge what you can and would be willing to pay. In 2012, the International Air Transportation Association called it “New Distribution Capability”.\n\nThis is a much scarier proposition now than it was then; companies have a lot more data they can exploit. In 2012, they might simply have known your flying habits and credit score, while balancing their desire to get the most they can for the seat against the time they have left to sell it. Uber uses similar tactics; it raises the price of a ride – “surge pricing”, or “dynamic pricing” – when demand is high.\n\nToday, an airline might know – or be able to find out – that you are racing against time to see a beloved relative before they die. And why should it stop with airlines? Exploitative possibilities abound.\n\nUber has already been dubiously accused of charging more when riders’ phone batteries are low. Retailers collect shopping histories through loyalty cards and apps; often customers already pay more for opting out.\n\nSome types of price discrimination have long been illegal under consumer protection law. On February 12, US senators Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) introduced the Stop Price Gouging in Grocery Stores Act of 2026 to block it in grocery stores. Other efforts are also underway in the US. This week’s news is calling this “surveillance pricing” or “predatory pricing”, which accurately reflects the data collection and surveillance capitalism underpinning.\n\nThis is not really a story about specific technologies, although “AI”; the issue is, as Hasbrouck writes, opacity and discrimination.\n\nThe technological pieces are in place to make this all much worse. Not just online, where prices are easily generated on the fly, but also in real-world retailers via wireless connections and electronic shelf tags, which already exist in some stores. A May 2025 study finds that these tags are so far not used to implement surge pricing but to update sale prices and offer discounts – but for how long?\n\nIn a May 2025 paper in the International Journal of Research in Marketing researchers examine the rise of algorithmic pricing – Uber, landlords, retailers – generally and personalized pricing in particular. The authors note that the latter requires market power, and buyers must have limited ability to exploit price differences. And also: it’s profitable (duh). The authors go on to discuss the role of privacy, data protection, consumer laws, and backlash, in curbing unfairness. At Big, which focuses on consolidation and market power, Matt Stoller warns of the potential power of Google’s plan to run pricing strategies for advertisers.\n\nHasbrouck returned to the subject last year while recapping the latest season of The Amazing Race to explain the airlines’ use of systems that deliver increasingly opaque and unpredictable pricing and the lack of enforcement enabling it.\n\nIn a pair of posts, the ACLU’s Jay Stanley follows Hasbrouck’s logic to new levels, laying out a possible future these developments may bring. The desire to wring every last possible bit of profit out of us – we’re talking everyone who sells goods or services now, not just airlines – in Stanley’s view will lead to collecting more and more detailed data. The digital identification infrastructure being built into airports – as planned here in 2013 and shown arriving in 2022 – will ensure there is no countermeasure we can take to escape monitoring and data collection. In Stanley’s projection, stores will be able to demand a digital identification sign-in as a condition of entry.\n\nAgain, a bit of this is here already. In the UK, Facewatch, which we first encountered in 2013, is used by some major retailers to identify and bar shoppers who have previously been caught shoplifting or being violent. Recently, the system flagged a shopper and staff ousted the wrong person, who found it difficult to prove the mistake.\n\nIn other words, all these technologies, wrapped up together, could enable a world not much different from that imagined by Ira Levin in his 1970 book This Perfect Day, where everything anyone wanted to do required permission from a centralized system. Although: the key to making that work was drugging the entire population.\n\nIllustrations: Burmese python in Florida, 2011 (via Wikimedia).\n\nWendy M. Grossman is an award-winning journalist.

    "fullText": "Figure 1: JPEG produced with DALL-E 4o\n\nEvery engineer I've worked with has used the phrase \"technical debt\", but everyone seems to have a different notion of what this phrase actually means. I've also found the phrase to be quite controversial, sparking knee jerk reactions that cut short any meaningful discussions around how to improve codebases and the systems they precipitate.\n\nIn general, I feel the term has become a catch-all for anything in a codebase that someone doesn't like – messy code, missing tests, old frameworks, that one service nobody wants to touch, that slow CI in a repo that everyone has to touch…. This imprecision isn't just sloppy language – it's actively harmful. When everything is \"tech debt,\" nothing is, and teams lose the ability to reason clearly about what to fix, when to fix it, and whether to fix it at all.\n\nWhen everything is \"tech debt,\" nothing is, and teams lose the ability to reason clearly about what to fix, when to fix it, and whether to fix it at all.\n\nThis post reclaims the financial metaphor that Ward Cunningham originally intended1, extends it with precise mappings to financial instruments, and proposes concrete management strategies that scale from a two-person startup to a thousand-engineer enterprise.\n\nThe key insight elicidated in this post, and the main subject of my argument, is that the real danger isn't the debt itself – it's the interest. This post will be useful to you because, if you are like most teams, you likely don't know your interest rate.\n\nTechnical debt is a deliberate deviation from an optimal design that yields short-term value at the cost of increased future work.\n\nLike financial debt, it has principal (the cost to fix), interest (the ongoing drag), and an interest rate (the frequency with which you interact with the debt multiplied by the friction it causes).\n\nThe problem isn't taking on debt – it's failing to manage the interest. This post provides a framework for classifying, measuring, and paying down technical debt at any organizational scale.\n\nIn 1992, Ward Cunningham presented an experience report at OOPSLA describing the development of a financial portfolio management system in Smalltalk. He needed to justify ongoing refactoring to his business stakeholders, so he reached for a an unironically relevant metaphor they'd understand1:\n\nShipping first time code is like going into debt. A little debt speeds development so long as it is paid back promptly with a rewrite… The danger occurs when the debt is not repaid. Every minute spent on not-quite-right code counts as interest on that debt. – Ward Cunningham\n\nNotice what he didn't say. He didn't say \"writing bad code is like going into debt.\" He said shipping code before you fully understand the problem domain is like going into debt. The distinction matters enormously.\n\nCunningham was describing something specific: the team had built a working system, and through the process of building it, they had learned things about the domain that the code didn't yet reflect. The code worked. It was well-written. But it encoded an earlier, incomplete understanding of the problem. The \"debt\" was the gap between what the team now understood and what the code expressed.\n\nThis is a much more subtle – and much more useful – concept than \"the code is messy.\"\n\nBuilding on Cunningham's original insight, and drawing from a decade of subsequent refinement by Martin Fowler, Philippe Kruchten, and others, here's the definition I use:\n\nTechnical debt is a deliberate or accidental deviation from an optimal design that yields short-term value at the cost of increased future work.\n\nTechnical debt is a deliberate or accidental deviation from an optimal design that yields short-term value at the cost of increased future work.\n\nFurthermore, technical debt has four essential properties:\n\nThat last point is critical. A mortgage isn't reckless. Neither is shipping a prototype with hardcoded configuration to validate a business hypothesis. The question isn't whether to take on debt. It's whether you know you're doing it, and whether you have a plan to service it.\n\nPrecision matters here. Conflating these concepts with tech debt dilutes the metaphor to uselessness.\n\nThe litmus test: does this thing have both a principal (cost to fix) and an interest rate (ongoing cost of not fixing it)? If it only has a principal and no meaningful interest, it's not debt – it's just cleanup work. If it has interest but no meaningful principal (you can't fix it), it's a constraint, not debt.\n\nThe power of Cunningham's metaphor is that finance has centuries of well-developed theory for managing debt. But most engineers use the analogy at the level of \"debt = bad, pay it off\" – which is about as sophisticated as saying \"mortgages are bad, never buy a house.\"\n\nLet's map the concepts precisely.\n\nA key insight falls out of this mapping:\n\nHigh-interest debt is debt that compounds every time you touch it.\n\nHigh-interest debt is debt that compounds every time you touch it. The auth module you hack around daily costs orders of magnitude more than the deployment script you run quarterly – even if the deployment script's remediation cost (principal) is lower. This is why prioritizing debt paydown by \"ease of fix\" is backwards. You should prioritize by interest rate.\n\nNot all debt is created equal, and not all debt should be treated the same way.\n\nHere are a few high level categories:\n\nFinancial analog: a 30-year fixed mortgage.\n\nThis is stable code that is architecturally imperfect but rarely touched. For example, this could be a data ingestion pipeline written in Python 2 that runs once a month and processes CSV files. If it works and nobody modifies it, then the interest is near-zero because the frequency of interaction is near-zero.\n\nManagement strategy: leave it alone. Seriously. Refactoring this is like paying off a 2% mortgage early when you have 20% credit card debt. It's mathematically silly.\n\nFinancial analog: credit card debt.\n\nThis is the core module that every team touches daily and everyone hates. For example, the ORM that requires three workarounds per query, or the authentication layer that breaks in every test environment, or the deployment pipeline that takes 45 minutes and fails 20% of the time.\n\nI once worked on a team where the API gateway had been \"temporarily\" written as a single Express.js middleware file. Every team in the company routed through it. Every feature that touched authentication, rate limiting, or request validation required modifying that file. We had merge conflicts on it daily. The file was 3,000 lines long. The principal to fix it – decomposing it into proper middleware layers – was maybe two weeks of focused work. We deferred it for eighteen months because no sprint ever had \"room.\" By the end, we estimated that the accumulated interest – in merge conflicts, debugging time, and incidents caused by accidental regressions in that file – had cost us closer to six months of engineering time. Two weeks of principal. Six months of interest. That's a 1,200% annual rate.\n\nManagement strategy: pay this down immediately. Every day you don't costs more than the day before, because interest compounds with each interaction. This is where the \"just ship it\" mentality becomes catastrophically expensive.\n\nFinancial analog: an adjustable-rate mortgage.\n\nThis is debt whose cost changes based on external factors. A system that works fine at current scale but will collapse at 10x. Hardcoded assumptions about single-region deployment. A data pipeline that assumes English-only text.\n\nThe interest rate is low today but will spike when conditions change – a new market, a compliance requirement, a viral moment. The danger is that by the time the rate spikes, the principal has grown too.\n\nManagement strategy: cap your exposure. You don't need to fix it now, but you need to know about it and have a plan. Architecture decision records (ADRs) are your friend here – they document the assumptions that, when violated, will trigger a rate increase.\n\nFinancial analog: off-balance-sheet liabilities (the kind that caused the 2008 financial crisis).\n\nThis is the scariest kind. Tribal knowledge that exists only in one engineer's head. Undocumented invariants that the code silently depends on. A deployment process that only works because of a specific order of operations that nobody has written down.\n\nHidden debt is the technical equivalent of off-balance-sheet liabilities – the kind that brought down Lehman Brothers. You don't know about it until it explodes.\n\nManagement strategy: incognito leverage too dangerous – make it visible. Do bus factor analysis, documentation sprints, runbooks, chaos engineering – anything that surfaces hidden assumptions. You can't manage debt you can't see.\n\nTechnical debt doesn't appear and disappear in a single event — it follows a lifecycle. The diagram below traces debt from the moment it's incurred through a decision point where teams choose one of five responses. Notice the feedback loops: deferred debt compounds back into accruing interest, and even \"resolved\" debt eventually gives way to new debt as the system evolves.\n\nMartin Fowler's Technical Debt Quadrant provides the best taxonomy I've seen for why debt gets created. It classifies debt along two axes: deliberate vs. inadvertent and prudent vs. reckless2.\n\nEach quadrant requires a different response:\n\nIt's important to resist the temptation to moralize about technical debt. In many contexts, taking on debt is the right decision:\n\nTech debt is often a sign of rational decision-making under uncertainty – not incompetence.\n\nThis is the framing I use with stakeholders, and it changes the conversation immediately. Instead of \"we need to clean up the code\" (which sounds like an engineering vanity project), it becomes \"we need to manage our financial exposure\" (which sounds like responsible governance).\n\nMost teams think about technical debt in terms of principal – \"how hard would it be to fix this?\" They estimate the cost of a refactor, put it on the backlog, and let it sit there because it never outranks the next feature.\n\nBut the principal is static. The interest is what kills you. And interest compounds.\n\nAvoid metrics theater. Lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, and lint scores are proxies at best and noise at worst. The following signals are more useful for measuring the interest on your technical debt:\n\nThese signals map directly to interest, not principal. A system with high change amplification and a high fear factor is accruing massive interest, regardless of how \"easy\" the fix would be.\n\nInterest on technical debt compounds in ways that are genuinely analogous to financial compound interest. Consider a module with a 10% \"tax\" – every feature touching this module takes 10% longer than it should.\n\nHacking around debt like trying to kill a mythological hydra – the effort is herculean, but the problem only grows with each swing of the engineer's sword.\n\nIn isolation, 10% sounds manageable. But compound it:\n\nThis is how a 10% tax becomes a 50% tax in 18 months. I've seen this exact pattern play out at multiple companies. Hacking around debt like trying to kill a mythological hydra – the effort is herculean, but the problem only grows with each swing of the engineer's sword. If the banner image of this blog post reminds you of a terrifying hydra, then I've accomplished my goal of being illustrious.\n\nThe chart above models three scenarios over five years. The red line shows what happens when debt is left unmanaged – a 10% velocity tax compounds into a 50%+ tax within a few years. The yellow line shows moderate, consistent debt service. The green line shows aggressive front-loaded paydown that levels off once the worst debt is addressed.\n\nThe takeaway: the earlier you start servicing debt, the cheaper it is. Just like a mortgage.\n\nThe compounding effect isn't just an analogy – it's a law of software evolution.\n\nLehman's laws of software evolution, established empirically in the 1970s and validated repeatedly since, state that4:\n\nLaw #2 is the kicker. Complexity doesn't increase because engineers are careless. It increases because that's what happens to systems that interact with the real world. Entropy is the default. Order requires energy. This is as true in software as it is in thermodynamics.\n\nEntropy is the default. Order requires energy.\n\nTechnical debt, in this framing, is unreduced complexity – the delta between the system's current complexity and the minimum complexity needed to serve its current purpose. Interest is the ongoing cost of carrying that excess complexity. And Lehman tells us that without deliberate effort, that delta only grows.\n\nSo the debt compounds. The interest accrues. Lehman's second law tells us complexity grows by default. The natural question is: what do you actually do about it?\n\nThe right approach depends heavily on context. A strategy that's right for a 500-person engineering org can be lethal for a 5-person startup, and vice versa.\n\nThis is where debt management gets serious, and where I've seen the most damage done. At one growth-stage company I worked with, the engineering team tripled in a year. The codebase they inherited from the startup phase was a classic \"clean interfaces, dirty internals\" system – which had been fine at 8 engineers. But at 30, the dirty internals became a coordination bottleneck. Three teams would independently hack around the same internal limitation in three different ways, creating three new debt instruments per quarter. The startup-era debt didn't grow linearly with headcount – it grew quadratically, because every new engineer was another node in the collision graph.\n\nYou're past the point where everyone knows everything, but not yet at the scale where platform teams and formal governance make sense. This is the most dangerous stage.\n\nAllocate fixed capacity for debt service. 15-25% of engineering capacity, every sprint, non-negotiable. This is not a \"20% time\" passion project. This is interest payments. McKinsey's research found that organizations with systematic debt management freed up engineers to spend up to 50% more time on value-generating work5.\n\nAt enterprise scale, technical debt becomes systemic risk. Individual modules matter less than system-level friction: API boundaries, deployment pipelines, shared libraries, and the organizational structures that produce them.\n\nNotice how the allocation to debt service increases with company size. This is counterintuitive – you'd think larger companies with more resources could afford less proportional debt spending. But larger companies have more accumulated debt, more system boundaries where debt hides, and higher coordination costs. The 5% a startup spends is \"fix it when you see it.\" The 25% an enterprise spends is \"dedicated teams, formal processes, migration projects.\"\n\nOne of the most powerful reframings in this entire financial analogy:\n\nRefactoring is not \"paying off\" debt. It's refinancing it.\n\nWhen you refinance a mortgage, you don't eliminate the debt. You replace one debt instrument with another that has better terms – lower interest rate, more predictable payments, better aligned with your current financial situation.\n\nGood refactoring does the same thing:\n\nThis reframing matters because it changes the conversation with stakeholders. \"We need to stop feature work for 3 months to clean up the code\" is a hard sell. \"We're refinancing – we'll reduce our ongoing maintenance costs by 30%, freeing up 2 engineers' worth of capacity for new features\" is a business case.\n\nNo discussion of technical debt in 2026 is complete without addressing the elephant in the IDE: AI code assistants.\n\nGitHub Copilot, Claude, and their cousins have fundamentally changed the economics of code production. Writing code is now cheaper and faster than ever. But cheaper production doesn't mean cheaper ownership – and this is where the financial analogy becomes urgent.\n\nGitClear's 2025 research on AI-assisted code quality found11:\n\nGoogle's 2024 DORA report corroborates: teams with higher AI adoption reported faster code review and improved documentation, but the same cohort showed a measurable decrease in delivery stability3.\n\nIn financial terms: AI assistants have massively increased the rate at which teams can issue new debt, while simultaneously reducing the rate at which existing debt gets serviced.\n\nThe mechanism is straightforward:\n\nThis creates a specific new type of debt that deserves its own name: comprehension debt.\n\nAI assistants have massively increased the rate at which teams can issue new debt, while simultaneously reducing the rate at which existing debt gets serviced.\n\nComprehension debt is the gap between the size of a codebase and any individual engineer's ability to hold a working mental model of it. Traditional technical debt is about code that's wrong – suboptimal designs that create friction. Comprehension debt is about code that might be individually correct but is collectively unintelligible. Each AI-generated function may work perfectly, but when 40% of the codebase was written by an LLM that doesn't know your team's conventions, the overall architecture drifts toward incoherence – ten different patterns for error handling, six ways to call the same API, three duplicate utility functions that almost-but-do-not-quite do the same thing.\n\nThe insidious property of comprehension debt is that it can't be addressed by traditional refactoring. You can't \"fix\" a codebase that nobody can hold in their head. The debt isn't in any individual module – it's in the aggregate. The principal doesn't show up in any static analysis tool, and the interest manifests as slower onboarding, more bugs from unexpected interactions, and a growing sense among senior engineers that \"nobody really knows how this system works anymore.\"\n\nHere's the uncomfortable truth that most engineers don't want to hear:\n\nTechnical debt is often a management and incentive problem, not a technical one.\n\nConway's Law states that organizations design systems that mirror their own communication structures8. The implication for technical debt is profound: organizational friction becomes architectural friction becomes technical debt.\n\nIf teams A and B can't communicate efficiently, the interface between their services will accrue debt – duplicated logic, mismatched assumptions, undocumented contracts. The debt isn't caused by poor engineering. It's caused by poor organizational design. And no amount of refactoring will fix it, because the structure that created the debt will recreate it.\n\nThe Inverse Conway Maneuver – deliberately restructuring teams to match the desired architecture – is the only way to address this class of debt. It's also politically difficult, which is why this debt tends to persist.\n\nTechnical debt grows fastest in organizations with these incentive patterns:\n\nTech debt grows fastest where engineers feel powerless to address it. If your process doesn't allocate time for debt service, debt will accumulate. This is not a technical problem. It's a governance problem.\n\nThe most pernicious version of this: organizations that say they value quality but measure only velocity. Engineers quickly learn which metric actually matters, and they optimize accordingly.\n\nLet's pull everything together into a practical framework.\n\nYou can't manage what you can't see. Build a simple inventory:\n\nDon't over-engineer this. A spreadsheet or a markdown file (or org-mode file if you're cool like me 🤪) in the repo is fine. The point is visibility, not process.\n\nSort your inventory by interest rate, not by principal. The debt that every team interacts with daily costs more than the debt that one team encounters quarterly, even if the quarterly debt has a higher remediation cost.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt Priority Score} = \\text{Interest Rate} \\times \\text{Number of Affected Teams} \\times \\text{Interaction Frequency}\n\\]\n\nThis isn't meant to be precise – it's meant to force the right conversation.\n\nDecide on a fixed percentage of engineering capacity for debt service. This should be:\n\nIn practice, I've seen this work best when the allocation is protected at the team level, not the org level. Telling 50 teams \"the org is allocating 20% to debt\" is meaningless. Telling each team \"20% of your sprints go to debt service, and here's how we'll track the impact\" creates accountability.\n\nFor each debt paydown initiative, define:\n\nTrack these before and after. This builds the institutional evidence base for continued debt service investment.\n\nHere's a concrete example: suppose you're refactoring the authentication module. Before starting, measure: average PR size for auth-touching features (say, 15 files), average time from \"code complete\" to \"merged\" (say, 4 days), and staging failure rate for auth changes (say, 25%). Set targets: reduce PR size to <8 files, merge time to <2 days, staging failures to <10%. After two sprints of focused refactoring, measure again. If the metrics moved, you have evidence. If they didn't, you're either fixing the wrong thing or the refactor isn't done yet.\n\nPaydown without prevention is a treadmill. Implement:\n\nLet me end with the thesis I promised at the start:\n\nYou don't eliminate technical debt. You structure it.\n\nEvery financial system carries debt. Healthy companies have mortgages, lines of credit, and corporate bonds. The difference between a healthy company and a bankrupt one isn't the presence of debt – it's the management of it. Healthy companies know their debt-to-equity ratio, their interest obligations, and their capacity to service existing debt before taking on more.\n\nThe same is true for codebases.\n\nA healthy codebase has known, documented debt with managed interest rates, owned by specific teams, prioritized by business impact, and systematically paid down. An unhealthy codebase has the same amount of debt but nobody can tell you what it is, how much it costs, or who's responsible.\n\nEvery system carries debt. The question is who pays, when, and how predictably.\n\nThe financial analogy isn't perfect. No analogy is. But it gives us a vocabulary – principal, interest, refinancing, credit rating – that makes the invisible visible and the abstract concrete. It transforms \"we have a lot of tech debt\" from a vague complaint into a specific, actionable diagnosis: what is the debt, what is the interest rate, and what is our plan for servicing it?\n\nStart there. The rest follows.\n\nCunningham's original insight was that shipping code creates a gap between what you've built and what you now understand. Thirty-four years later, the insight holds – but the gap has widened. We ship faster, understand later, and compound the difference daily. The metaphor he gave us is still the best tool we have for closing it. Use it precisely, and it will serve you well.\n\nThis post reclaims Ward Cunningham's original financial metaphor for technical debt and extends it into a comprehensive framework for managing code quality at any organizational scale.\n\nThe core argument begins with a precise definition: technical debt is a deliberate or accidental deviation from an optimal design that yields short-term value at the cost of increased future work. Critically, not everything that frustrates engineers is debt—bugs are liabilities, legacy systems are only debt if they impede change, and \"bad code\" is a style preference unless it causes measurable drag.\n\nThe post maps technical concepts to financial instruments with precision: principal is remediation cost, interest is ongoing friction, and the interest rate is interaction frequency multiplied by system friction. This leads to a taxonomy of debt types—low-interest long-term debt (like a mortgage), high-interest revolving debt (like credit cards), variable-rate debt whose costs spike under changing conditions, and dangerous hidden debt that lurks off the balance sheet.\n\nMartin Fowler's quadrant classifies debt by whether it was deliberate or inadvertent, prudent or reckless—each requiring different responses. The post argues that debt is often rational, especially for startups validating product-market fit or teams exploring uncertain requirements.\n\nThe central thesis emerges in the section on interest: the real danger isn't the debt itself but the compounding interest. The post provides practical signals for measuring interest—change amplification, time-to-confidence, fear factor, and rework rate—and illustrates how a 10% velocity tax can become 50% in 18 months through compound effects that Lehman's Laws predict are inevitable without deliberate countermeasures.\n\nManagement strategies vary by company stage: startups should accept higher interest rates while avoiding irreversible debt, growth-stage companies must allocate 15-25% of capacity to debt service, and enterprises need platform teams functioning as internal lenders with enforced contracts at system boundaries.\n\nThe post reframes refactoring as refinancing rather than cleanup—replacing one debt instrument with another that has better terms—and distinguishes good refinancing (incremental, measurable) from bad (big-bang rewrites, cosmetic changes).\n\nA timely section addresses AI-generated code as a new debt accelerator, introducing the concept of \"comprehension debt\"—the gap between codebase size and any engineer's ability to maintain a working mental model. The data shows AI tools have increased code production while reducing refactoring activity, creating a dangerous imbalance.\n\nOrganizational factors often matter more than technical ones: Conway's Law means organizational friction becomes architectural friction becomes debt, while incentive misalignment (rewarding only shipping, no ownership past delivery) accelerates accumulation.\n\nThe post concludes with a five-step framework: inventory your debt, prioritize by interest rate rather than principal, allocate fixed non-negotiable capacity for debt service, execute with measurable targets, and prevent new high-interest debt through ADRs and architecture tests. The final message: you don't eliminate technical debt, you structure it—just as healthy companies carry managed debt with known obligations and clear ownership.\n\nWard Cunningham first described the debt metaphor in his 1992 OOPSLA experience report, \"The WyCash Portfolio Management System.\" He later clarified in a 2009 video that the metaphor was specifically about the gap between the team's evolving understanding and the code's current design – not about deliberately writing poor code.\n\nMartin Fowler's Technical Debt Quadrant (2009) built on Cunningham's original metaphor by distinguishing between deliberate/inadvertent and prudent/reckless debt. This taxonomy is now widely used in industry.\n\nGoogle's DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) program has tracked software delivery performance for over a decade. The 2024 State of DevOps report introduced rework rate as a fifth key metric and found mixed results from AI adoption: improved throughput but decreased stability. See: dora.dev.\n\nLehman's laws of software evolution were first proposed by Meir M. Lehman in 1974 and refined through the 1990s. The laws describe empirically observed properties of \"E-type\" systems (software that solves real-world problems). The key insight – that complexity increases unless explicitly counteracted – has been validated across decades of research. See: Wikipedia: Lehman's Laws.\n\nMcKinsey's 2023 report \"Breaking technical debt's vicious cycle to modernize your business\" found that technical debt consumes a significant share of IT budgets – CIOs surveyed reported that as much as 40% of their technology estate was composed of tech debt. Organizations with systematic debt management freed engineers to spend up to 50% more time on value-generating work. One CIO reported reducing the \"debt tax\" on engineer time from 75% to 25%.\n\nArchitecture Decision Records (ADRs) were popularized by Michael Nygard in a 2011 blog post. The format is simple: Context, Decision, Consequences. The key value is recording the context so future engineers understand why the decision was made, not just what it was.\n\nFor a deep dive on schema languages as an interface-level debt prevention strategy, see my companion post: The Schema Language Question: Avro, JSON Schema, Protobuf, and the Quest for a Single Source of Truth.\n\nConway's Law, introduced by Melvin Conway in 1967, states that \"organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.\" Research from MIT and Harvard Business School found \"strong evidence to support the mirroring hypothesis.\" See: Wikipedia: Conway's Law.\n\nThe Strangler Fig pattern was named by Martin Fowler in his 2004 blog post, inspired by the strangler fig trees he observed in Australia. The pattern involves building a new system around the edges of the old, gradually routing traffic from old to new, until the old system can be decommissioned.\n\nJoel Spolsky's \"Things You Should Never Do, Part I\" (2000) argues that full rewrites are \"the single worst strategic mistake that any software company can make,\" citing Netscape's decision to rewrite their browser from scratch as a cautionary tale. The argument is that working code, however ugly, embodies years of accumulated knowledge about edge cases and failure modes that a rewrite will inevitably lose.\n\nGitClear's \"AI Copilot Code Quality: 2025 Data Suggests 4x Growth in Code Clones\" analyzed over 200 million lines of changed code to measure the impact of AI assistants on code quality metrics. The findings suggest that AI tools are accelerating code production while reducing refactoring activity, leading to increased duplication and higher churn rates.",

    "description": "Five months after being labeled a nuisance, Downtown Market at 11th and Grand remains open despite city orders and an eviction. From David Hudnall:",
    "fullText": "For a business that was supposed to be on the brink of closure, Downtown Market is doing a brisk trade.\n\nFive months after the city labeled it a nuisance and the landlord moved to evict, the lights are on at 1103 Grand. The beer coolers hum. The liquor selection remains vast. The counter display still includes synthetic urine kits for anyone looking to game a drug test. Step outside the market, and you won’t struggle to find a sidewalk entrepreneur selling some of the substances those tests are meant to detect.\n\n“We’re still seeing all the same activity, dealing with all the same problems,” said Jason Swords, one of the owners of The Grand, a high-rise a few doors down. “We still find bottles of alcohol all over the place on the sidewalks every morning. There are vagrants everywhere. We still see people hiding in the alleyways, peeing on the sidewalks.”\n\nIt has not been for want of effort from those with authority to intervene.\n\nIn September, Public Safety Director Lace Cline sent Downtown Market a cease and desist letter giving the store 10 days to correct conditions the city said enabled “unrelenting, open, and notorious drug activity and public intoxication.” The letter cited 184 calls for service over two years — 101 of them disturbances — and referenced a January 2025 shooting inside the store.\n\nTwo months later, the building’s owner took the matter to Jackson County court. The Alexander Company, which owns the 16-story Professional Building where Downtown Market occupies the ground floor, filed suit seeking to give Downtown Market the boot. The landlord says it sent a notice of default in October, gave the tenant time to address multiple violations, then terminated the lease when it concluded the problems continued. It has asked a judge for possession of the space and back rent while the case plays out.\n\nThe city and the landlord have the same gripe: The lease envisioned something more like a grocery store for on-the-go downtown dwellers and workers. The operation on the ground moves mostly booze and attracts loose characters that have turned the block into something resembling a skid row.\n\nShawn Choudry, part of the management team that owns Downtown Market, has a different version of the story: This is a city problem, not a Downtown Market problem.\n\n“Downtown Market didn’t get 184 calls for service,” Choudry told me back in the fall. “This area did. The problems come from outside our store, not inside.”\n\nChoudry said this week that he preferred to let his countersuit against The Alexander Company do the talking for now. That complaint, filed in January, says the market’s owners poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into renovating the space and that its mix of groceries, alcohol and tobacco was approved from the start. It argues that, contrary to the landlord’s allegations, alcohol makes up less than half of sales and that much of the activity cited by the city happens at the bus stop across the street. It accuses the landlord of using the city’s nuisance designation as leverage to push them out of a long-term lease.\n\nThis fight probably burns hotter because of where it sits. The corner of 11th and Grand is a few blocks from the Power & Light District and T-Mobile Center, adjacent to the city’s financial district, and next door to the Ambassador Hotel. It is a part of downtown that’s supposed to feel stable and safe, a stretch of street the city will be showing off to visitors with the World Cup on the horizon.\n\nSwords and his investors at The Grand have been saying for months that the disorder around their building is bleeding into their balance sheet. They’ve asked PIEA, the city’s Planned Industrial Expansion Authority, for additional tax relief, arguing that shootings, street activity and constant repairs have made their $69 million investment increasingly difficult to sustain.\n\nPIEA hasn’t taken up that request yet; chair Tom Porto told me this week that he expects it to come before the board later this spring. I imagine Kansas City Public Schools and other taxing jurisdictions that would forgo revenue in such a deal are unlikely to shrug quietly at the prospect of extending further relief to a project already enjoying a substantial tax break.\n\nSwords said he has noticed a stronger police presence in recent months. He credits officers for spending more time on the block and the city for trying to take action against Downtown Market, even if the day-to-day street scene still looks familiar to him.\n\nOn my own drop-ins over the past few months, the store does appear to be on slightly better behavior. The supply of kratom products and other “gas station drugs” has been cleared out, and I’m not seeing loosies or airplane bottles moving across the counter.\n\nHis complaints are backed up by the call data regardless. I asked KCPD for calls to service to the address since the cease and desist went out in September. Between late August and mid-February, police logged 215 calls — including most commonly disturbances (69), followed by advice or non-emergency calls (56). At least 10 incidents involved weapons, and more than 40 required fire or EMS response.\n\nI asked Mayor Quinton Lucas Wednesday where the city stands on the matter, and got a statement heavy on legal phrasing. The plain-English version reads something like: The city intends to keep citing and pushing for compliance while the landlord-tenant case works its way through court, and it hasn’t ruled out shutting the place down if conditions don’t improve. It has made a similar move at least once in recent years, when it closed an illegal nightclub on Prospect Avenue after a shooting.\n\nBut it remains hard to know how much the issue involves Downtown Market customers versus people who would be on that corner regardless. Closing Downtown Market might remove one piece of the puzzle. But the corner sits at the intersection of much bigger problems in the city: chronic homelessness, addiction and a mismanaged KCPD budget that has started to make sustained community policing feel like a luxury. One padlock won’t solve all that.",

    "fullText": "Investigators examining last year’s deadly Air India Flight 171 crash in Ahmedabad have concluded the disaster was caused by the pilot in command deliberately moving both engine fuel control switches to cutoff, according to a report published Thursday.\n\nThe Boeing 787 Dreamliner lost thrust seconds after takeoff and crashed into a medical student hostel on June 12, 2025, killing 241 people on board and 19 on the ground. The report cites cockpit voice and flight data recordings that allegedly show manual shutdown of both engines despite no evidence of mechanical failure.\n\nBlack box data under review: The aircraft’s cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered days after the crash and sent for detailed analysis as part of the investigation led by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau with technical assistance from U.S. and U.K. authorities. The Boeing 787 was powered by twin engines and equipped with electronically controlled fuel systems that require intentional manual input to change fuel flow settings. Investigators have examined parameters including throttle position, engine core speed and fuel flow rates to determine the sequence of events in the seconds between liftoff and impact.\n\nMental health scrutiny surfaces: The report also claims that Captain Sumeet Sabharwal had experienced depression in the months before the crash, citing unnamed sources familiar with the inquiry. Sabharwal’s family has publicly rejected assertions about his mental health and called for a fresh and impartial investigation. Pilot associations in India previously objected to earlier reports suggesting pilot responsibility, urging authorities to avoid attributing blame before the final report is issued.\n\nTrending on NextShark: AI research boom draws scrutiny after single author claims 113 papers in one year\n\nLegal questions emerge: The crash has prompted scrutiny beyond the technical investigation, including reports that Air India has offered financial settlements to some victims’ families. According to separate media accounts, the offers allegedly included provisions limiting the ability to pursue legal action against the airline and the aircraft manufacturer. Air India has not publicly detailed the terms of any such agreements, and the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau has yet to release its final determination of cause.\n\nThis story is part of The Rebel Yellow Newsletter — a bold weekly newsletter from the creators of NextShark, reclaiming our stories and celebrating Asian American voices.\n\nTrending on NextShark: Minority psychologist coalition challenges Jewish ethnic recognition within APA\n\nSubscribe free to join the movement.

    "description": "Consumers should stop using the product immediately.",
    "fullText": "Freeze-dried food and treats have become a popular feeding option for both cats and dogs. The food provides a better delivery system for nutrients to your pets without the downsides of raw food, which can pose a salmonella risk.\n\nHowever, freeze-dried foods are not exempt from recalls. One popular cat food brand recently issued a voluntary recall for their freeze-dried chicken cat nuggets. It wasn't for bacterial contamination, though. This recall was due to a possible vitamin deficiency.\n\n🐶\nView the complete details on this recall at: https://t.co/E5Zy1sSKuI pic.twitter.com/pSb6bD7qW0\n\n— U.S. FDA Recalls (@FDArecalls) February 18, 2026\n\nIf your cat is eating the Quest Cat Food Chicken Recipe, you need to check your pantry. The voluntary recall affects one specific lot: C25288 with the UPC: 6-91730-18103-1 and a Best Buy Date of 10/15/2027. The zip-lock bags were sold in Colorado, Utah, Washington, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Michigan, California, Texas and Illinois. The affected batch may have low thiamine levels, also known as vitamin B1.\n\nThe recall of the freeze-dried nuggets was triggered after a cat owner reported illness in their cat. Thankfully, a veterinarian treated the cat, and it has recovered. So far, it is the only cat to have experienced adverse effects from the product.\n\nThe product was tested by the veterinarian who treated the ill cat, and the test indicated that the lot did not meet the required thiamine levels to support a cat's diet. Quest conducted further testing to verify that the lot may have low thiamine levels. Quest's parent company, Go Raw LLC, has already taken measures to ensure that this doesn't happen again.\n\nThiamine is considered an essential nutrient for cats. According to a 2017 study, the water-soluble vitamin helps animals process carbohydrates, synthesize nucleotides, and maintain normal nervous system function. Since they can't produce the vitamin on their own, they need to consume at least 0.33 to 0.35 milligrams per day to maintain healthy levels.\n\nWhile deficiencies can be reversed if caught early enough, they can lead to severe medical issues. According to the FDA's press release, cats' nervous systems and stomachs can be affected. \"Early signs of thiamine deficiency may include decreased appetite, salivation, vomiting, failure to grow, and weight loss,\" the release said. \"In advanced cases, neurological signs may develop, including ventroflexion (bending towards the floor) of the neck, mental dullness, vision changes, wobbly walking, circling, falling, and seizures.\"\n\nIf not treated in time, cats can also become so ill that they die from their symptoms. Go Raw LLC has said that consumers should immediately stop using the product and return it to the store where it was purchased for a full refund. If you have any questions, you can email the company at cs@gorawllc.com or call them at (801) 432-7478, Monday through Friday, 9 am to 4 p.m. MST.",

    "fullText": "The car market can often defy logic. As we are aware, buying used saves money in general, as new cars lose a potential 30% of their value within two years. Yet, this isn't always the case: some used models often sell for above the MSRP of their newer rivals.\n\nIt doesn't make sense, but there are reasons for this. For instance, inventory may have been disrupted by market events, such as the 2022 semiconductor shortage. Moreover, when demand outstrips supply, certain vehicles become more desirable, which only drives wider interest.\n\nWhich cars make the grade for this unique selection? Using the latest iSeeCars listings data, among other sources, we have compiled this fleet of stalwarts. As you can probably guess, Toyota is quite the overperformer.\n\nIf you're looking for a new car to get you from point A to B and back, these might be worth considering.\n\nThe Ford Maverick boasts a hybrid powertrain option that can deliver strong fuel economy and a modest tow rating that still handles everyday tasks. As a selling point, it is one of the few pickups appealing broadly from daily commute to weekend jobs. This used car has an astonishingly high price difference over a new model: around 12.3% and an average $4,038 increase.\n\nMoreover, its smaller footprint makes city parking easier, and standard features like smartphone integration and a comfortable cabin extend its value on the used market. It is clearly a very popular used car choice. According to Drew Dorian at Car and Driver, the Maverick is \"a simple, honest truck with enough capability for casual truck drivers who don't need something the size of an F-150.\"\n\nToyota's Corolla Hybrid has quietly become one of the most efficient compact sedans/SUV alternatives on the road. Of course, it is just one reason why used examples can fetch prices well above their new counterparts in recent listings.\n\nIn its 2026 review, Car and Driver observed that the Corolla Hybrid can deliver fuel economy into the 50+ mpg range. Such an irresistible economy makes it stand out among compact vehicles, where efficiency and cost rule the roost. That blend of everyday thrift and strong reliability has translated into strong demand for lightly used units. It goes without saying that Toyota's hybrid technology has decades of consistent performance under its belt, which translates to trust in the used market.\n\nLike its Japanese rival, Toyota, Mercedes has already convinced us how much we can trust them. The company's reputation for durability means buying used comes with few doubts. The Mercedes-Benz G-Class is no exception and arguably the premier example of a luxury SUV whose used pricing often exceeds new MSRP on dealership listings.\n\nThis outcome is particularly true for low-mileage AMG variants. The G-Class blends classic design with formidable off-road capability and premium amenities that appeal to enthusiasts and luxury buyers alike. According to Edmunds' appraisal data, a 2024/2025 G-Class can still command dealer retail values well into the high five figures and beyond.\n\nMinivans usually depreciate faster than SUVs, so the Toyota Sienna is in a league of its own, and not just for this unique trait. For starters, it's one of the few modern minivans that never got replaced by SUVs, instead evolving into a hybrid-only platform that's both fuel-thrifty and family-friendly.\n\nThat reputation for practicality, combined with strong reliability, has led to very tight used-car inventories, keeping prices close to or above new MSRP in many markets.\n\nIn its 2025 coverage, MotorTrend's Bob Hernandez called the Sienna \"one of the most enduring people movers in North America,\" noting its efficient hybrid powertrain, generous interior space, and thoughtful tech upgrades, including larger infotainment screens and refined connectivity features.\n\nThe Toyota RAV4 Prime is the plug-in hybrid version of America's perennial SUV bestseller. This trusty little SUV is one of the models that still shows used pricing above new MSRP in the latest iSeeCars research. It's a reflection of the RAV4 Prime's demand among buyers who want both electric range and SUV utility.\n\nDrew Hardesty of the YouTube channel Car Confections cites the 2024 Prime as his all-around favorite SUV. He says it \"builds upon the already excellent formula of the Rav 4 hybrid and gives you that pure electric range and more performance without compromising really anything.\" The video estimates that a used 2024 RAV4 Prime retains a nice 65% of its resale value after five years, which is why these SUVs are hard to find.\n\nWhile often underrated against bigger siblings, the Toyota Corolla Cross has quietly boomed in popularity. The TCC is a small SUV with a big following and a solid performer in a small package, much like Prince before he departed the stage for good.\n\nIt has held its own so well that used prices have edged above new MSRP in national iSeeCars listings. Built on Toyota's reliable foundation, the Corolla Cross delivers comfortable seating, good visibility, and efficient performance: traits that buyers prize in a small SUV. There is a clear Toyota-shaped pattern emerging here.\n\nOfficially, Toyota's RAV4 is America's favorite SUV, according to AutoBlog's Jacob Oliva. It means that demand is at an all-time high, and inventory is tight. Added to this fact, RAV4s will go hybrid, pushing used demand even further.\n\nNot all used RAV4 Hybrid pricing comes from electrified variants: the standard RAV4 Hybrid also appears above new MSRP in some used listings. Owners can appreciate its smooth ride quality, good fuel economy, and adaptability from suburban roads to light off-road trails: a balance that can appeal to many buyers.\n\nWhile Japan's Toyota is unmatched for long-term auto investment, South Korea is never far behind. Kia's success has been palpable over the past two decades in the USA, and the Carnival's utilitarian design makes it one of the more popular models. With minivans less common than SUVs, buyers seeking maximum space without jumping to larger three-row SUVs have helped keep Carnival prices firm. Furthermore, it has the handling, feature content, and usability rather than sheer economy to promote resilience.\n\nJerry Seiner of Kia South Jordan in Utah reminds us why they are so popular. \"Kia vehicles are built to last, with high-quality materials and engineering designed for longevity,\" he writes. \"This focus on durability means that even older Kia models can perform well and maintain their aesthetic appeal over time.\"\n\nThis off-road icon with huge cult appeal has seen a revival this decade, making it one of Ford's recent success stories. Built on a rugged ladder frame, the Bronco offers multiple trim levels, powerful turbocharged engines, and authentic off-road capability with selectable drive modes designed to conquer terrain from sand to mud.\n\nFor an idea of which models will retain value best, perhaps this Everything Bronco Aftermarket review will enlighten. \"Models such as the Bronco Raptor with the top-spec V6 and the limited edition Ford Bronco Heritage Edition are likely to retain value the best,\" it reads.\n\nIf there's one vehicle that has turned depreciation into something of a practical joke, it's the Toyota Tacoma. This iconic midsize pickup has become America's go-to for reliability and longevity, rugged enough for weekend hauling but compact enough for daily use.\n\nThat reputation for durability and desirability means light-mileage used Tacomas are sometimes priced as high as or higher than new ones: a rare exception to the usual depreciation curve.\n\nKelley Blue Book's (KBB's) \"Best Resale Value Awards\" make clear that the 2025 Toyota Tacoma has a strong 64% resale value. This credential makes it highly in demand across the used car markets.",

    "description": "The court action brings an end to three years of negotiating by eight men, including Freeburg’s mayor.",
    "fullText": "Former Major League Baseball player Danny Cox and three other men have entered plea agreements on hunting citations issued three years ago on his property in rural Freeburg.\n\nThis brings an end to cases against eight men, including Freeburg Mayor Seth Speiser, in St. Clair County Circuit Court. Illinois Conservation Police had issued them a total of 29 citations and 22 written warnings after a monthlong investigation.\n\nThis week, Cox pleaded guilty to two of six alleged violations, according to court records. They include falsifying harvest records by using an archery permit issued to someone else, a Class A misdemeanor; and taking a 10-point buck with aid of bait, a Class B misdemeanor.\n\nAssociate Judge Maurche’ Belk fined Cox $700. She dismissed cases related to four other citations for allegedly placing bait for deer, firearm deer hunting with aid of bait, taking an 8-point buck with aid of bait and failing to wear blaze orange while hunting.\n\n“It was a prosecution that led to an outcome of guilt on the charges,” said Chris Allen, spokesman for State’s Attorney James Gomric’s office, which negotiated the plea agreements.\n\nConservation police, formerly known as game wardens, are part of the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. IDNR representatives declined to comment for this story.\n\nUnder an agency point system, Cox’s convictions on the two violations would result in 22 points against his hunting license and lead to a 22-month suspension of privileges.\n\nCox, 66, formerly pitched for the St. Louis Cardinals, Philadelphia Phillies and Toronto Blue Jays, and managed the Gateway Grizzlies. He didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nCox’s two sons, Kamdan and Kyle, and a fourth hunter, Steve Pate, entered similar plea agreements this week. All were represented by former State’s Attorney John Baricevic.\n\nSpeiser, 61, owns property next to 300 mostly wooded acres owned by the Cox family. The mayor, his son and another man entered plea agreements last month in St. Clair County Circuit Court.\n\nSpeiser pleaded guilty to placing bait for deer. Associate Judge L. Dominic Kujawa fined him $400, placed him on 12-month court supervision and dismissed cases related to three other citations for alleged taking of a white-tailed deer with aid of bait and firearm deer hunting with aid of bait.\n\nAll four charges against Speiser were Class B misdemeanors. Under Illinois law, each carried a maximum penalty of up to six months in jail and/or a fine of up to $1,500.\n\nIf Speiser completes supervision and isn’t cited for additional hunting violations in the next year, the first charge also will be dismissed, according to Allen. However, that won’t eliminate his penalties. The nine points against his hunting license don’t reach the 13-point threshold for suspension.\n\nHere are the results of the other plea agreements:\n\nKamdan Cox, 30, of Clarksville, Tennessee, pleaded guilty to one violation involving turkey hunting. He was fined $800. Belk dismissed cases related to six other citations.\n\nKyle Cox, 35, of Belleville, pleaded guilty to using a hunting license issued to someone else. He was fined $500. Belk dismissed cases related to two other citations.\n\nSteve Pate, 65, of Marietta, Georgia, pleaded guilty to archery deer hunting without a valid permit and unlawful taking of a 7-point buck. He was fined $600. Belk dismissed cases related to two other citations.\n\nMitchell Speiser, 28, of Freeburg, pleaded guilty to taking a protected species (white-tailed deer). He was fined $400 and placed on 12-month supervision. Kujawa dismissed a case related to one other citation.\n\nBrian Forrester, 38, of New Athens, pleaded guilty to firearm deer-hunting with aid of bait.

    "fullText": "All truckers and bus drivers will have to take their commercial driver’s license tests in English as the Trump administration expands its aggressive campaign to improve safety in the industry and get unqualified drivers off the road.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced the latest effort Friday to ensure that drivers meet the federal requirements to understand English well enough to read road signs and communicate with law enforcement officers. Florida already started administering its tests in English.\n\nCurrently, many states allow drivers to take their license tests in other languages even though they are required to demonstrate English proficiency. California offered tests in 20 other languages. Duffy said that a number of states have hired other companies to administer commercial driver's licenses tests, and those companies aren't enforcing the standards that drivers are supposed to meet to demonstrate their driving and English skills.\n\nThese latest enforcement efforts come just days after the Transportation Department said 557 driving schools should close because they failed to meet basic safety standards. The department has been aggressively going after states that handed out commercial driver’s licenses to immigrants who shouldn’t have qualified for them ever since a fatal crash in August.\n\nA truck driver who Duffy says wasn’t authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people. Other fatal crashes since then, including one in Indiana that killed four members of an Amish community earlier this month, have only heightened concerns.\n\nStates are expected to ensure drivers can speak English before giving them a commercial license, and then law enforcement is supposed to check driver's language skills during any traffic stops or inspections. Drivers who can't communicate effectively are supposed to be pulled off the road. A recent federal effort involving 8,215 inspections led to nearly 500 drivers being disqualified because of their English skills. California initially resisted enforcing the English rules, but the state recently pulled more than 600 drivers off the highways.\n\nDuffy said every American wants drivers who get behind the wheel of a big rig to be well-qualified to handle those vehicles. But he said that for too long the problems in the trucking industry were “allowed to rot and no one's paying attention to it for decades.\"\n\n“Once you start to pay attention, you see that all these bad things have been happening. And the consequence of that is that Americans get hurt,” Duffy said. “When we get on the road, we should expect that we should be safe. And that those who drive those 80,000-pound big rigs, that they are well-trained, they’re well-qualified, and they’re going to be safe.”\n\nThe campaign will also now expand to prevent fraudulent trucking companies from getting into the business while continuing to go after questionable schools and ensure states are complying with all the regulations for handing out commercial licenses.\n\nDuffy said that the registration system and requirements for trucking companies will be strengthened while Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration inspectors conduct more spot checks of trucks and commercial driver’s license schools.\n\nOfficials are also trying to make sure that the electronic logging devices drivers use are accurate, and that states are following all the regulations to ensure drivers are qualified to get commercial licenses.\n\nCurrently, companies only have to pay $300 and show proof of insurance to get registered to operate, and then they might not be audited until a year or more later. And even then the audits might be done virtually, which makes it less likely to identify fraudulent companies.\n\nThat has made it easy for fraudulent companies that are known in the industry as “chameleon carriers” to register multiple times under different names and then simply switch names and registration numbers to avoid any consequences after crashes or other violations.\n\nDan Horvath, who is the chief operating officer for the American Trucking Associations trade group, said this longstanding problem has made it far too easy for companies that have been ordered to shut down to just change their name and registration number and keep operating the same way.\n\n“What we think at ATA has happened over the years is that we have a lack of true enforcement and intervention with motor carriers that are in operation,” Horvath said. Only a small fraction of trucking companies ever undergo a full compliance review with an in-person inspection, he said.\n\nAfter that Indiana crash, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration knocked the company that employed the driver out of service and pulled the DOT numbers assigned to two other companies that were linked to AJ Partners. Tutash Express and Sam Express in the Chicago area were also disqualified, and the Aydana driving school that the trucker involved in the crash attended lost its certification.\n\nImmigration authorities arrested that driver because they said the 30-year-old from Kyrgyzstan entered the country illegally. Authorities say he pulled out and tried to go around a truck that had slowed in front of him, and his truck slammed into an oncoming van.\n\nIn December, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration took action to decertify up to 7,500 of the 16,000 schools nationwide, but that included many defunct operations.\n\nDuffy said the companies involved in that Indiana crash were all registered at the same apartment. In other cases, there might be hundreds of these chameleon companies registered at a single address.",

    "fullText": "In a scene that feels ripped from a procedural drama, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Scott Thomas Deiseroth, 42, was pulled off a Florida Keys highway in August 2025 after deputies say he was driving erratically on the Seven Mile Bridge with his two young sons in the truck — and body-camera footage reveals a confrontation that spiraled from a simple DUI stop into a forceful arrest and a viral controversy.\n\nDeputies from the Monroe County Sheriff’s Office were dispatched around 3:24 p.m. on August 13 after multiple calls reported a pickup weaving between lanes, crossing into oncoming traffic, and nearly causing collisions on U.S. Highway 1 near Bahia Honda.\n\nWhen deputies caught up to the truck near Mile Marker 36.5, they immediately noticed a strong smell of alcohol and two children, ages 7 and 9, in the back seat.\n\nThe encounter was already tense from the first words captured on bodycam. Deiseroth identified himself as an ICE agent based in Miami, insisting he was trying to get home with his boys and that his federal status mattered in how the deputies should treat him. When asked for his Department of Homeland Security credentials, he didn’t have them on hand.\n\nThings escalated when deputies asked him to perform standardized field sobriety exercises. In the footage, Deiseroth repeatedly challenges the stop, asking “Are you Haitian?” about one of the deputies — a moment that has since become the focal point of national attention on race, privilege, and bias.\n\nDeputies insist that nationality has no bearing on the stop being conducted, but Deiseroth presses the question several times, appearing to imply that the deputy’s background should influence how the situation is handled.\n\nThe video shows Deiseroth struggling with basic coordination tasks like walking in a straight line and reciting numbers. At one point he flails and stumbles, prompting deputies to question how much he has been drinking.\n\nHe claims “about four drinks,” but cannot clearly describe what he drank, and his speech and motor skills appear impaired.\n\nWhen deputies move to place him under arrest for DUI and child endangerment — a charge bolstered by the presence of his children in the vehicle — Deiseroth resists, at times refusing to step toward the patrol car and shouting at them.\n\nHe expresses fear of losing custody of his kids, saying he is in the middle of a divorce, and continues to rail against the officers even while being handcuffed.\n\nAfter the arrest, his children were handed over to their mother, and the Florida Department of Children and Families was notified, as required in cases involving potential child endangerment. Deiseroth was booked into the Monroe County Jail on misdemeanor charges of driving under the influence and resisting without violence.\n\nThe case drew national headlines not just for the surreal body-cam footage, but for the questions it raised about accountability and privilege when a federal law enforcement officer becomes the suspect.\n\nA spokesperson for ICE reportedly said that all employees are held to the agency’s highest standards, and that the matter would be addressed appropriately after investigation. At the time the footage was released, Deiseroth remained on administrative leave pending the outcome of that review.\n\nIn late 2025, Deiseroth pleaded no contest to the DUI charge. On October 30, he was sentenced to one year of probation and had his driver’s license revoked for the same period.\n\nProsecutors declined to pursue child neglect and resisting arrest charges. That decision elicited sharp criticism from some legal observers and social commentators. But that’s not all.\n\nMeanwhile, the body-cam clip continues to circulate widely, igniting debate about how law enforcement is held to account and becoming another chapter in broader discussions about ICE conduct, racial profiling, and public trust in policing agencies.\n\nEditorial Note: Video playback may be limited or restricted on certain platforms.

    "fullText": "The Gender Liberation Movement’s Raquel Willis says trans youth “are our future” and that new HHS rules amount to a national ban on gender-affirming care for young people.\n\nRather than do something, anything, about the abysmal state of healthcare in the United States, the Trump administration’s Department of Health and Human Services has doubled down on its attacks against trans youth, their families, and the web of providers who work to ensure young people can live comfortably and fully in their truths. Of course it’s not just HHS. Last summer, the conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court ruled that it isn’t discriminatory to discriminate against trans youth. But HHS has the ability to take that bigoted opinion even further by barring institutions from providing gender-affirming care as a condition of their participation in Medicare and Medicaid. The same condition would apply to Children’s Health Insurance Program funding. In other words, these proposed rules would affect nearly all, if not all, hospitals.\n\nYet there hasn’t been much coverage about them. In this dizzying era of “flood the zone” tactics, our basic freedoms are pitted against one another. We deserve more, and young people certainly deserve better.\n\nLed by the Gender Liberation Movement, 50 parents and activists, including members of ACT UP NY and ACT UP Pittsburgh, protested outside of Health and Human Services headquarters on Tuesday, on the final day of the public comment period of the rules, to make it known that “trans youth are no debate.” Organizers held a sign that read, “HANDS OFF OUR ’MONES,” while blockading the entrance of HHS, before 25 people were taken into custody, first by Department of Homeland Security agents before being handed over to the Metropolitan Police Department. The parents and activists were held for 12 hours, and some were denied food and phone calls or experienced mistreatment because of their race or gender identity, Raquel Willis, cofounder of the Gender Liberation Movement, told The Nation. The group, which organized the inaugural Gender Liberation March in 2024, works “to build power for gender liberation in culture, organizing, and policy.”\n\nIn an email interview, Willis, who was one of the organizers at the protest who was arrested, discussed why this fight over gender-affirming care is a fight for the future and what people can do to champion trans youth.\n\nRegina Mahone: Why was it important to Gender Liberation Movement to block the entrance to the HHS building?\n\nRaquel Willis: This is a critical time in the fight against tyranny and fascism, and it was necessary for us to express our public comment to Trump, RFK Jr, and their HHS that we won’t allow these cuts to care to go unopposed. With so many fights happening at once, the attacks on trans youth, their families, and affirming, qualified service providers are largely being ignored. We saw this last summer when the Supreme Court effectively greenlit state bans on gender-affirming care with its ruling in US v. Skrmetti—and there was minimal media and movement response.\n\nWe hope that, sooner rather than later, our movement will wake up and bring back some of that energy it had during marriage equality to fight for the next generation of trans, nonbinary, queer, and intersex youth. We owe it to them.\n\nRM: Can you talk about the experiences of the protesters, yourself included, who were then held in custody for some 12 hours?\n\nRW: Over those 12 hours, the arrested protesters were held in custody of the Department of Homeland Security and the Metropolitan Police Department. We spent hours having our paperwork and processing delayed by inept officers from the former agency without clarity on when we would be released or with what we would be officially charged.\n\nSome protesters were denied food and calls to their emergency contacts and legal advisers. A few of us experienced discriminatory practices like what seemed like racial profiling due to darker skin. Additionally, some transgender and nonbinary protesters were misgendered, denied housing based on their actual gender even when their ID documents aligned, and forced into solitary confinement.\n\nRM: People don’t often consider the right to protest as an issue of bodily autonomy, but the fact of these arrests and the experiences you described while in custody make that undeniable. This administration has proven it will use force not only over how we are living in our bodies but also how we defend our rights to agency and autonomy. Why was it important to you to put your body on the line, once again, particularly in this era of ramped up state violence?\n\nRW: Just as our ancestors and elders in liberation movements before us fought for dignity and full lives, the Gender Liberation Movement believes we must do the same now. Since the start of this current Trump era, we have leaned into radical defiance, understanding that we can’t simply comply, otherwise there will be no stopping at the rights that are pried out of our hands. As well, young people are so thoroughly spoken over in our society and we wanted to send a message that we see them and we are committed to protecting and defending them. So much of this care that is being stolen from trans youth is still accessible to cisgender youth, and that is utterly immoral.\n\nRM: You’ve spoken and written about how “our liberation is bound together.” Can you talk more about how this issue of trans care isn’t solely an issue for trans youth and their families but an issue that affects all of us?\n\nRW: For too long the narrative has been that trans people are isolated and alone, but the truth is we have always had vibrant, loving communities and families around us. Trans youth give us the clearest example of this. When their care is cut off, whole entire families are disturbed, as well as the network of adults from providers to educators who affirm them.\n\nWe know that the current administration’s actions to cut off care for trans youth won’t stop there. The ages on the bans keep creeping up and it won’t be long until we see more cuts for access to care for trans adults as well. This administration wants to take more and more away from people on the margins, whether you’re trying to afford insulin or mental health medications or simply rely on Medicaid and Medicare to live the full, healthy life you deserve.\n\nRM: How can people help to minimize the harm being done right now and be a shield for trans youth in their communities who would be harmed by these rules seeking to eliminate most trans youth care in the country?\n\nRW: We must continue to raise our voices against these attacks and all anti-trans legislation. We must urge progressive and empathetic lawmakers to champion trans youth, the adults who love and support them, and all of our rights. We must educate our neighbors on why voting for these measures would be against their own interest. We must pour resources into and donate to organizations who are supporting groups on the frontlines from Gender Liberation Movement to our friends with the Trans Youth Emergency Project and Elevated Access. We must, above all, continue to build a culture that affirms and supports trans youth and their truths. They are our future and we better start acting like it.",

    "fullText": "MILAN — Polish skater Kamila Sellier suffered a serious injury in the sixth quarterfinal of Friday night’s 1500m short-track speedskate and was taken from Assago Ice Skating Arena to a nearby hospital. Polish officials indicated that she was in good spirits, even raising a thumbs-up as she left the arena.\n\nLate in the quarterfinal, Sellier appeared to lose her footing and slipped, colliding with the United States’ Kristen Santos-Griswold. In the ensuing accident, Santos-Griswold’s skate caught Sellier on the face. Sellier slid into the protective retaining wall, and medical crews raised a sheet around her to protect the scene from the audience. She was stretchered from the ice.\n\nMasakra ....\nFatalnie wyglądał wypadek Kamili Sellier podczas rywalizacji w short tracku na igrzyskach olimpijskich. Polka została uderzona płozą w okolice oka podcazs upadku . pic.twitter.com/eXfVLDMCTx\n\n— 🅰️rcy Łobuz 🅿️olski 🇵🇱 , 🇳🇱 (@PObuz46445) February 20, 2026\n\nKonrad Niedźwiedzki, press attache for the Polish speed skating team and a 2014 Olympian, informed reporters at the arena that Sellier had suffered a cut on her cheek and eyelid that required stitches. Other reports indicated that Sellier had potentially fractured a cheekbone and suffered severe swelling.\n\n“We are waiting for what the hospital tests will show,” Niedźwiedzki said, via translation.\n\nOne of Sellier’s teammates, Natalia Maliszewska, appeared visibly shaken as she spoke with reporters. “My thoughts are with her,” Maliszewska said in Polish. “I can’t think of anything else.”\n\n“These aren't common accidents, but they do happen,” Sellier’s teammate Gabriela Topolska said in Polish. “Kamila already has one of them, from a skate on her face. Kamila has a cut in her skin, with stitches.”\n\nSellier has won several European speed-skating medals, most recently a silver medal in the 2000m mixed relay at the European short track speed skating championships in January.\n\nSantos-Griswold was disqualified from the race, potentially because of an illegal pass that led to the accident. She declined to speak to media after the race, which continued after the injury timeout.",

    "title": "Posts claim transcript shows McConnell, Kevin McCarthy discussed 'bringing back slavery.' There's no proof",
    "description": "Versions of the alleged phone call shared online were scant on details about when the conversation supposedly took place.",
    "fullText": "In late February 2026, Snopes readers asked us about videos of internet users listening to an unidentified voice reading out a purported transcript of a phone call between two Republican politicians, Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell and former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy.\n\nIn the call, McConnell and McCarthy allegedly discussed bringing back slavery, creating state-funded religious schools, banning abortion, stemming immigration and the forced impregnation of eighth-graders.\n\nWe found no credible evidence that the transcript was authentic or that any such conversation between McConnell and McCarthy ever took place. The claim is unfounded.\n\nIn February 2026, social media users wrote to Snopes on Instagram, asking about videos of internet users listening to an audio clip (archived) of an alleged transcript of a phone call between Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. The transcript was supposedly a record of the two men discussing measures to ban abortion, stem immigration, create state-funded religious schools, bring back slavery and impregnate eighth graders.\n\nOne of the Instagram users who posted a video of themselves listening to the transcript wrote in text superimposed over the clip, \"Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy talk about bringing slavery back & and making it mandatory for 8th graders to get pregnant in order to graduate.\"\n\nThe claim also circulated on X (archived), Facebook (archived), Bluesky (archived) and Reddit (archived).\n\nWe found no evidence whatsoever that the audio clip or transcript represented an authentic conversation between McConnell and McCarthy.\n\nWe found no reputable news sources reporting the \"leaked\" transcript (archived, archived, archived, archived), which would have been extremely newsworthy if true. Though McConnell and McCarthy both previously voted against federal protections for abortion, a common opinion for their party, neither had publicly expressed opinions or plans that aligned with the other supposed policy points like slavery and state-funded religious education allegedly discussed on the call.\n\nWe reached out to representatives for McConnell and McCarthy to ask if the transcript read out in the videos was genuine and await replies to our queries.\n\nThe full transcript of the alleged phone call, which an unidentified voice read out, was as follows:\n\nMitch: We have to bring slavery back. Those were the good old days.\n\nKevin: How will we do that, there's no way we can do that.\n\nMitch: Black people won't do it but white people will.\n\nKevin: How will we get white people to be slaves? That sounds ridiculous.\n\nMitch: We have to get rid of the separation of church and state. We must have state-funded religious schools.\n\nKevin: I don't see where you're getting at.\n\nMitch: Those schools will have work programs for fourth through eighth graders.\n\nKevin: Ah, I think I see where you're going here. How is that going to work?\n\nMitch: We get the kids to be — to pick all the produce as a part of their work program to teach them the values of good, old-fashioned blue-collar labor and the bounty of God.\n\nKevin: I don't think that anyone will go for that.\n\nMitch: It's all about grooming, start in the first grade and by fourth grade they'll be ready to do it.\n\nKevin: But we already have people to pick the produce.\n\nMitch: We have to finish the wall.\n\nKevin: No way that's going to happen.\n\nMitch: We find better ways to get the immigrants out of the United States.\n\nKevin: This will be too busy, too hard and we'll be too busy trying to sustain this over long periods of time and generations.\n\nMitch: No, we get rid of the abortion laws in the United States and we make it mandatory that all eighth-grade females be impregnated in order to graduate.\n\nKevin: Oh, like replacing the crops. Ha ha ha. Pun intended.\n\nAlso Kevin: I will work on getting the abortion ban, you work on state-funded religious schools.\n\nMitch: We don't have to do either. Lindsey and I took care of that with the new SCOTUS.\n\n\"Lindsey\" was an apparent reference to Lindsey Graham, the senior senator from South Carolina and a fellow Republican. \"SCOTUS\" is a common abbreviation for the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nThe versions of the alleged phone call shared online were scant on details about when the conversation supposedly took place. Some said the recording was from July 2022, but did not back up this claim. Online postings contained no further information about who leaked the alleged call or why.\n\nAs stated above, Snopes found no evidence that the alleged call between McConnell and McCarthy was real, nor did the call seem to reflect the politicians' publicly expressed opinions.\n\nMcConnell and McCarthy both voted against the Women's Health Protection Act, which would \"prohibit governmental restrictions on the provision of and access to abortion services.\" The bill passed the House in 2021 but failed in the Senate in 2022.\n\nSince then, McConnell has said that abortion should be dealt with at a state rather than a federal level. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a nonprofit that seeks to reduce and ultimately end abortion in the U.S., rated both McConnell and McCarthy \"A+.\"\n\nBoth McConnell and McCarthy have historically opposed slavery, a central theme of the alleged call, on their social media accounts. McCarthy spoke (archived) of the \"evils\" of slavery in 2019. That same year, McConnell wrote (archived) about \"slavery's stain on our history\" on X. However, McConnell did previously oppose the idea of reparations for slavery, saying in 2019 he didn't think \"reparations for something that happened 150 years ago, for whom none of us currently living are responsible, is a good idea.\"\n\nLastly, McConnell allegedly advocated for \"state funded religious schools\" in the phone call transcript. These schools, he allegedly argued, would be the basis for the renewed slavery project, as students would participate in work programs. In reality, McConnell has historically been a strong advocate for school choice, co-authoring an opinion piece in 2013 that argued \"Choice breeds competition — which is the best way to improve schools,\" an opinion that would seemingly be at odds with advocating for forced attendance at state-funded schools.\n\nThis was not the first rumor Snopes has investigated about either McConnell or McCarthy. For example, we previously looked into claims that McConnell said he would not participate in 2020 election debates that included female moderators and that a photo authentically showed McCarthy watching himself lose a vote for speaker of the House.\n\nBlad, Evie. \"Senate GOP Sticks to School Choice Push in Slimmed Down Relief Proposal.\" Education Week, 8 Sep. 2020. www.edweek.org, https://www.edweek.org/education/senate-gop-sticks-to-school-choice-push-in-slimmed-down-relief-proposal/2020/09.\n\nChu, Judy. \"H.R.3755 - Women's Health Protection Act of 2021.\" Congress.Gov, 6 Aug. 2021, https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3755.\n\nHuffington Post: Op-Ed by Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, Sens.
